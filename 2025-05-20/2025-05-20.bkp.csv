            Until last week, a secretive fleet of ships ferrying Russian oil around the world showed no clear links to the Kremlin. That changed when, in a dramatic escalation, Russia used a fighter jet in an apparent effort to protect one of the tankers thought to be in the fleet.
    


            After the Estonian military contacted the Jaguar – an unflagged tanker sanctioned by the United Kingdom earlier this month – on May 13 in an attempt to carry out checks, a Russian Su-35 fighter jet flew past the ship, inside Estonian airspace, the Estonian Defense Forces said. The military eventually escorted the tanker out of Estonian waters.
    


            “This is something very new,” Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told reporters Thursday at a NATO meeting in Turkey. Russia has now “officially tied and connected itself” to the so-called shadow fleet, he added.
    


            Others agree. “This seems to be a step-change in Kremlin thinking,” Ed Arnold, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a UK-based think tank, told CNN.

Europe's undersea infrastructure keeps getting damaged. What's going on?



            Estimated to be hundreds of vessels strong, with no official ties to Russia, the “shadow fleet” includes many old, poorly maintained ships, which have in some instances wreaked environmental havoc and, according to some, have been implicated in damage to vital undersea cables off the Baltic coast. Russia has denied any role in the damage.
    


            The tankers, many with opaque ownership structures, transport Russian oil for export to avoid Western sanctions. As such, they have themselves become a focus of further sanctions on Moscow.
    


            Russia's use, for the first time, of “military action” in response to economic sanctions “is a testament to the level of the threat that we're facing on the eastern flank of NATO,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told journalists at the meeting in Turkey.
    


            Video shot from the bridge of the Jaguar, which appears to have been edited, shows a radio call from Estonian authorities demanding the ship change course, with Estonian military ships and aircraft visible around the tanker. CNN has corroborated details of the footage, which was shared online by Margarita Simonyan, editor in chief of Russian state media outlet RT.
    


            Later in the video, a sole Russian Su-35 fighter jet sweeps ahead of the tanker, which was previously named the Argent, according to shipping records and the UK government. In response, Portuguese F-16 jets on a NATO mission in Estonia were rushed to the area to monitor the Russian aircraft, NATO said.
    


            The jets are part of a strengthened NATO presence in northern Europe since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
    


            “Probably what the Kremlin is trying to do is push back on that, so in the hope that NATO nations get spooked by what happened (last Tuesday),” said Arnold at RUSI.
    


            “There will be those within NATO who are a bit worried about this and say, ‘Well, hang on, do we really want to risk starting a wider confrontation with Russia over one ship?'”
    


            For the Estonians, the Russian jet's intrusion into Estonian air space is proof that Western sanctions are biting.
    


            The incident “demonstrates that monitoring and sanctioning the shadow fleet is effective and that such efforts must be further intensified,” the Estonian Defense Forces said in a statement.

            CNN was not able to locate the registered owner of the Jaguar for comment. The Russian Ministry of Defense has declined to respond to CNN's request for comment. The Kremlin has previously refused to respond to accusations that it uses a “shadow fleet.”
    


            In January, following repeated incidents in which ships caused damage to undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea, NATO launched the “Baltic Sentry” initiative to bolster its military presence in the waters.
    


            “We see the (Tuesday) incident as a reaction to Baltic Sentry,” Col. Martin O'Donnell, a NATO spokesman, told CNN. “Russia's destabilizing actions will not deter us from acting within international law to maintain maritime security, safety and freedom of navigation.”
    


            German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday that a new sanctions package could be adopted as early as Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to join Russia's talks with Ukraine in Turkey last week. Merz had said earlier that Russia's “shadow fleet” – “permanently operating in the Baltic Sea with up to 300 ships” – would be specifically targeted in this package.
    


            In a possible tit-for-tat move, a Greek-owned oil tanker, Green Admire, was detained Sunday by Russia as it transited Russian waters on a route agreed by Estonia, Finland and Russia, Estonia's foreign minister posted on X.
    


            CNN has reached out to the vessel's owner and the Russian foreign ministry for comment. The Russian foreign ministry has not responded.
    


            Estonian authorities have conducted more than 450 checks on vessels in Tallinn-controlled waters in the Baltic Sea since last June, according to the country's transport ministry. This includes the Gulf of Finland, one of the principal conduits for Russian overseas trade.

Follow:


            Think of Japan's famed yakuza gangs and you might think of heavily tattooed men getting into bloody fights – the stuff of action films and video games.
    


            But last week four men were arrested in Tokyo for a more mundane crime - operating a yakuza office too close to a library.
    


            The suspects, ages 55 to 77, “conspired” to operate an office from June 2024 to February 2025, “despite the fact that the area was within a 200 meter radius around a library,” said police in a statement. The city has strict rules on where yakuza offices can operate, as part of their campaign to eliminate organized crime.
    


            The oldest man, 77, was a “member of an organization affiliated with the Sumiyoshi-kai organized crime syndicate,” one of Japan's biggest yakuza groups, the statement added.
    


            Known for their strict hierarchies and honor codes, the yakuza – also known as the boryokudan – engage in everything from extortion and money laundering to drugs and sex trafficking.
    


            Far from being underground organizations, many are registered with the police and have an established presence across the country.
    


            The National Police Agency (NPA) even lists the business addresses of some yakuza organizations on their website; for instance, the Sumiyoshi-kai's main office is located in Tokyo's upscale Akasaka district, not far from the parliament building.
    


            During their heyday in the 1960s, the yakuza operated internationally and had more than 184,000 members, according to the NPA. But their numbers have declined steadily over recent decades after police crackdowns to curb their activities.
    


            Though they are legally still allowed to exist, regulations made it harder for gangsters to survive as it became illegal to recruit yakuza, pay them off, or share profits with them. Even securing mobile phone contracts and renting out apartments became more difficult.
    


            In 2024, the number of members of organized crime syndicates fell below 20,000 for the first time to a record low of 18,800, according to police data.
    


In Tokyo, yakuza offices cannot operate within 200 meters of schools, child welfare centers, community halls, museums, probation offices and family courts – as well as libraries.
    


            Businesses cannot hire yakuza members as bouncers, offer them payoffs for services, or sign any contracts with yakuza that “encourage” their activities.
    


            The result is shrinking yakuza groups that nowadays largely make headlines for disbanding, pursuing new law-abiding lives, or promising to behave.
    


            In April, Japan's largest yakuza crime syndicate, the Yamaguchi-gumi, pledged to end its longstanding war with a rival faction after police stepped up surveillance and restricted their activities. Three senior members of the gang hand-delivered a letter to police vowing to “end all internal fighting” and to “never cause any trouble,” police told CNN.

Hungary's parliament has approved a bill initiating the country's formal withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC). The move advances Prime Minister Viktor Orban's push to exit what his government has labeled a biased and discredited institution.

The National Assembly passed the legislation on Tuesday with 134 votes in favor, 37 against, and seven abstentions. The vote follows a decision in late April in which lawmakers agreed in principle to leave the ICC.

”Hungary firmly rejects the use of international organizations – in particular criminal courts – as political instruments,” read the bill published on parliament's website.

Hungary joined the ICC by signing the Rome Statute in 1999 and ratifying it in 2001. However, according to Orban, the country “has always been half-hearted” in its membership.

Orban announced the plan to quit The Hague-based institution last month during a state visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The ICC previously issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, alongside three Hamas leaders in November, over alleged war crimes in Gaza.

Orban accused the ICC of losing its impartiality and becoming a “political tribunal,” assuring Netanyahu that the court's actions “will have no effect in Hungary.” The Israeli prime minister praised Hungary's “bold and principled” stance against the “corrupt” court.

The ICC's jurisdiction is currently recognized by 123 countries. Among the non-signatories are the US, Russia, China, and Israel. The court does not have its own police force and relies on member-states to detain and transfer suspects.

In February, the administration of US President Donald Trump sanctioned the ICC and its top prosecutor, Karim Khan, for going after Netanyahu and Gallant.

Earlier this month, Khan took a leave of absence amid a UN investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct.

In 2023, the court also issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and children's rights commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing them of unlawfully deporting children from former Ukrainian territories. Moscow rejected the charges as “null and void,” insisting the children were evacuated from conflict zones for their safety and could be returned to their families upon request.

According to the terms of the Rome Statute, Budapest must notify the UN secretary-general of its intent to withdraw, and the decision would then take effect one year later.

Germany has said it supports new EU sanctions against Russia in the energy sector, following a phone call between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Berlin wants Washington to support the restrictions, though Trump is reportedly reluctant to ramp up pressure on Moscow.

Speaking at a press briefing on Monday, German government spokesman Stefan Kornelius said Berlin “supports the elements [of sanctions] related to Nord Stream,” adding: “It is, of course, also crucial that the US will accompany a potential sanctions package.”

The Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines connecting Russia and Germany under the Baltic Sea have been inactive since 2022 due to EU sanctions and sabotage, which Russia insists was orchestrated by Western intelligence agencies.

Last week, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the next round of EU sanctions would target Russia's financial sector, a fleet of ships used to bypass oil bans, and the Nord Stream system. The goal, she said, is to compel Moscow to accept a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine.

Moscow has stated that it is open to a ceasefire “in principle,” but has expressed concerns that it would only benefit Ukraine and allow its battered forces to regroup. Russia has also said it considers the Western sanctions illegal, while noting that the country's economy has long been accustomed to Western pressure.

The comments by the German official come after a highly anticipated two-hour phone call between Putin and Trump.

Putin described the call as “substantive and quite candid,” adding that Russia is ready to work with Kiev on drafting a memorandum on a potential future peace agreement. Trump described the call as “excellent,” noting that “Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a ceasefire and, more importantly, an end to the war.”

European leaders were “stunned” by Trump's response, the Financial Times reported, citing a source familiar with the matter. It added that the US president is apparently “not ready to put greater pressure” on Putin and did not make any promises regarding future punitive action.

FT sources also said Trump made it clear that “he would pull the US back from engaging with the conflict and leave Ukraine and Russia to directly negotiate a ceasefire.”

The phone call on Monday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, marks a positive development and continues to restore communication, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has said.

Talking to reporters on Tuesday, Rutte said it was a “good sign” that the conversation took place and welcomed Trump's “leadership” in efforts to resolve the Ukraine conflict. He added that the US president had “broken the deadlock” from “day one” since returning to office earlier this year.

Rutte acknowledged there had been “no discussions with the Russians” until January, when Trump began to “open lines of communication” with Putin.

Asked whether pressure on the Russian president should be increased, Rutte said, “Let's be thankful that Americans are now taking this position, this leadership role.” He added it would not be helpful for him, as a NATO leader, to comment on every step in the process.

Both Putin and Trump described their latest call as productive and encouraging. The US president said he expected progress on the Ukraine conflict within two weeks.

According to a Kremlin statement, Putin thanked Trump for “US support in resuming direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.”

Yury Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy aide, said the call was conducted in a tone of “mutual respect,” with Trump expressing support for normalizing ties between Washington and Moscow.

Putin said on Monday that he and Trump agreed that the next step should be a memorandum outlining principles and a timeline for a peace settlement in the Ukraine conflict. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the next day that “there is and cannot be a deadline” for completing the document.

Rutte's remarks come as NATO members seek ways to militarize and produce more weapons to be delivered to Ukraine. In March, the European Commission unveiled a plan to raise €800 billion ($896 billion) to “rearm” the EU.

The Trump administration has consistently demanded that European NATO states increase their annual military spending to 5% of GDP, calling the longstanding 2% target insufficient.

Russian officials have condemned the steps being taken in Europe toward militarization, and dismissed claims that Moscow intends to attack either the EU or NATO. Moreover, Russia has expressed concern that, rather than supporting the US peace initiatives for the Ukraine conflict, the EU and UK are instead gearing up for war with Russia.

BRUSSELS, May 20. /TASS/. Belgium is ready to deploy troops to Ukraine as soon as there is a ceasefire with Russia and annually provide the country with weapons worth one billion euros, Defense Minister Theo Francken told reporters.

""There is a task force of the coalition of the willing, and they are working under the leadership of the British and the French. They are developing a plan and working very closely together. The moment there is a ceasefire, we can immediately operate with the coalition of the willing on Ukrainian soil,"" Francken said upon his arrival at the EU foreign and defense ministers' meeting in Brussels.

The top defense official emphasized that Russian forces must withdraw from Ukrainian territory immediately following a ceasefire.

""We will keep on supporting Ukraine. We just approved a one-billion-euro package, and we will keep on supporting Ukraine for next years, [allocating] one billion euros in military aid each year,"" he noted, adding that Belgium uses this money to order weapons for Kiev from its own defense enterprises.

It's important that a significant part of this money comes back to Belgium and creates jobs in our defense industries. We have an excellent defense industry, which is why we will support it, even if it requires significant funding. That is why this billion is guaranteed; we will continue providing this level of support,"" Francken emphasized.

""We will try to deliver the F-16s even before the date that was fixed,"" the top defense official said, without specifying what he meant. The situation with the delivery of the promised F-16 jets remains unclear. The country promised to deliver the first two by the end of 2024. However, this date has been postponed repeatedly due to delays in the delivery of the F-35 jets ordered from the US in 2018.

Belgium only has about 40 F-16s, commissioned in the 1970s, and it promises to transfer them to Kiev as soon as it receives the new jets. It is unclear how many of the F-16s Belgium currently has are operational.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Over half (54%) of companies surveyed by insurer Allianz say they will have to raise prices to accommodate cost of tariffs

A majority of US companies say they will have to raise their prices to accommodate Donald Trump's tariffs in the US, according to a new report.

More than half (54%) of the US companies surveyed by insurance company Allianz said they will have to raise prices to accommodate the cost of the tariffs. Of the 4,500 companies across nine countries, including the US, UK and China, surveyed by Allianz only 22% said they can absorb the increased costs.

The unpredictability of US trade policy has also dented exporters' confidence. The survey found 42% of exporting companies now anticipate turnover to decline between -2% and -10% over the next 12 months, compared to fewer than 5% before 2 April “liberation day” – when Trump unveiled his tariff policy.

Though Trump has pulled back on many of the levies he initially proposed, key tariffs remain in place, including a 10% universal tariff on all US imports, a 30% tariff on Chinese imports and extra tariffs on specific industries like metal and auto parts.

Trump has insisted that tariffs will make America “very wealthy again”, though it appears that American companies and consumers are simply expecting to pay higher prices as the tariffs settle into place. In April, consumer expectations of inflation reached their highest point since 1981, according to the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research.

Instead of immediately raising prices, which could deter customers, many companies have spent months trying to get ahead of Trump's tariffs by stockpiling goods to temporarily circumvent them.

Nearly eight out of 10 American companies said that they frontloaded shipments to China before Trump announced his tariffs, with 25% saying they had started to front-load before the November 2024 election.

Inflation data from April showed that US price increases remained roughly level for the month. Economists say that it will take a while for tariff-related price increases to show up in data and companies have started to say they will pass some of the cost of tariffs onto consumers.

“Given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure,” Doug McMillion, Walmart's CEO, said in an earnings call last week. “The higher tariffs will result in higher prices.”

Toymaker Mattel also said that it would have to raise prices and that it would continue to manufacture its products outside of the US, “where [it] can be more efficient and more productive”, the company's CEO, Ynon Kreiz, told CNBC earlier this month.

The majority of companies (60%) in the report said they expect the tariffs to have a negative impact on their business, with less than half saying they expect positive export growth this year, down from 80% who had said the same at the beginning of the year.

While many companies are holding out on price increases, relying on stockpiled inventory and hoping trade deals will be reached soon, companies will have to raise prices in the summer if a trade war continues.

“Monthly business surveys … do indicate that companies will eventually pass on most of the tariff increases by the summer,” said Maxine Darmet, senior economist at Allianz Trade.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Trump reportedly also told House Republicans ‘don't fuck around with Medicare'; RFK Jr and Marco Rubio grilled by Senate commitees  

Earlier today, Donald Trump pressed Republicans in Congress to unite behind his sweeping tax-cut bill, but – despite his very optimistic front – apparently failed to convince a handful of holdouts who could still block a package that encompasses much of his domestic agenda.

In a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, Trump bluntly warned Republicans in the House of Representatives not to press for further changes to the sprawling bill, which would cut taxes and tighten eligibility for the Medicaid health program.

He strongly cautioned against further plans to make it more difficult for people to access Medicaid, a program for low-income Americans. One person in the room told Reuters Trump told the holdouts:

Don't fuck around with Medicaid.

He also discouraged Republicans from seeking further carve-outs for state and local tax payments (SALT) - a niche issue that is especially important for moderate Republicans in high-tax states like California and New York.

But Trump failed to convince some lawmakers who are pushing for those provisions.

“The president I don't think convinced enough people that the bill is adequate the way it is,” said Republican representative Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the hard-right House Freedom Caucus and has been pushing for further Medicaid cuts.

Republican representative Mike Lawler, a New York moderate who is pushing to raise limits on deductions for state and local tax payments, likewise said Trump did not change his mind.

As it stands right now, I do not support the bill.

After the meeting, Trump predicted the package would ultimately pass the House, which Republicans control by a narrow majority of 220-213. “It was a meeting of love,” he said. He did not address Harris' concerns.

Freedom Caucus members have been pushing for new work requirements on some Medicaid recipients to kick in earlier than is planned for 2029. But centrists have fought to protect the program, warning that steep cuts could imperil their majority in the 2026 congressional elections.

Trump said afterward the bill would eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse” in Medicaid but would not cause people to lose coverage.

Trump is pressing for every House Republican to vote for the bill, according to a White House official. As he arrived at the Capitol, Trump said Republican lawmakers who vote against it could “possibly” face a primary challenge in next year's congressional elections.

The United States has expressed to the United Arab Emirates and other countries that they are turning the conflict in Sudan into a proxy war, secretary of state Marco Rubio told the Senate foreign relations committee earlier.

Rubio also said that Washington wanted to appoint a special envoy for Sudan but needed to find the right person.

Robert F Kennedy Jr said earlier that the MAHA commission report Donald Trump tasked him producing would come out on Thursday.

Trump signed an executive order to establish a commission to “Make America Healthy Again,” during Kennedy's swearing in ceremony on 13 February and tasked it with investigating chronic illness and delivering an action plan to fight childhood diseases, starting with a report due within 100 days.

“You'll see the report. It's going to be released on Thursday. Everybody will see the report,” Kennedy told the Senate appropriations committee hearing in response to questions about the contents of the report and its impact on agriculture.

Trump said afterward the bill would eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse” in Medicaid but would not cause people to lose coverage.

Trump is pressing for every House Republican to vote for the bill, according to a White House official. As he arrived at the Capitol, Trump said Republican lawmakers who vote against it could “possibly” face a primary challenge in next year's congressional elections.

Secretary of state Marco Rubio said the US has not discussed the deportation of Palestinians from Gaza to Libya, but he said that Washington had asked other countries in the region if they would be open to accepting people in Gaza who want to move voluntarily.

“What we have talked to some nations about is if someone voluntarily and willingly says I want to go somewhere else for some period of time because I'm sick, because my children need to go to school, or what have you, are there countries in the region willing to accept them for some period of time?,” Rubio said, adding that he was not aware of Libya being included in that.

Rubio also told the Senate foreign relations committee that the United States was pleased to see the resumption of food shipments to Gaza, adding that the US understands that another 100 trucks are behind the initial ones to cross in to Gaza and more might enter in the coming days.

Interior secretary Doug Burgum defended the Trump administration's budget request on Tuesday in a House committee hearing.

Burgum testified before the House Appropriations Committee:

With common sense approaches and modern systems, we can increase returns for our citizens, strengthen our economy, and create great-paying and meaningful jobs – all while protecting our beautiful lands, our abundant wildlife, and our clean air and clean water.

The secretary took some mild heat from lawmakers, facing questions about hiring and funding freezes in the Department of Interior. Republican representative Mark Amodei of Nevada said:

How you can sit there and hold somebody's feet to the fire when there's a whole bunch of empty desks.

Trump has proposed shrinking the Interior Department budget by $5bn, with major cuts to national park management, conservation programming, and other key functions.

Despite the potential steep fall in funding, Burgum has issued an order requiring national park units to remain fully open to visitors.

The planned cuts follow the firing of probationary employees within the department in recent weeks, as well as the resigning of 2,700 workers who accepted Trump's “deferred resignation” offer.

“In just four months, the department has been destabilized, and there's been a stunning decline in its ability to meet its mission,” Democratic representative Chellie Marie Pingree of Maine told Burgum.

Given your extensive executive experience, I'm disappointed that you would allow this to happen.

Secretary of state Marco Rubio has defended the cuts to foreign aid under the gutting of USAID, telling the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee that the US still provides more assistance than the next 10 countries combined.

He also dismissed claims that China was stepping in to replace lost American aid, saying:

China doesn't do foreign aid.

Ukraine, he said, still has Washington's support and Russian president Vladimir Putin has not gained a single thing.

We reported earlier that Donald Trump met with House Republicans on Capitol Hill to unite around his tax and spending cuts proposal.

Speaking to reporters after the closed-door meeting, Trump said he had a “great talk” and that there was “unbelievable unity” in his party. He said:

That was a meeting of love. That was love in that room. There was no shouting.

Elon Musk said he plans to spend “a lot less” on political donations “in the future” after he gave millions towards Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign.

“I think I've done enough,” Musk said during an interview at the Qatar Economic Forum. He added:

If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it. I don't currently see a reason.

Musk spent more than $250m in the last election cycle to elect Trump and other GOP candidates.

Robert F Kennedy Jr defended his management of the ongoing measles outbreak in the US, telling Republican senator Jerry Moran, of Kansas, that he's urging people to get vaccinated against the virus, The Hill reports.

Moran asked Kennedy what the Department of Health and Human Services needed in order to best respond to the outbreak, which has surpassed 1,000 cases. Kennedy said:

The best way to prevent the spread of measles is through vaccination. We urge people to get their MMR vaccines. I spent a lot of time with the Mennonites and the MMR vaccine has millions of fragments of human DNA in it, from aborted fetal tissues, and that's a religious objection for them that I have to respect.

We've done a better job at controlling measles since I came into this agency than any other country in the world. Today, we're at 1,035 cases and we only added 27 cases last week.

As my colleague Jessica Glenza wrote recently, although Kennedy has tepidly endorsed the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to prevent measles, he has also made false and inflammatory claims about the vaccine, including repeating the above false claim that it contains “aborted fetus debris”. The rubella vaccine, like many others, is produced using decades-old sterile fetal cell lines derived from two elective terminations in the 1960s.

The US is enduring the largest measles outbreak in a quarter-century. Centered in west Texas, the measles outbreak has killed two unvaccinated children and one adult and spread to neighboring states including New Mexico and Oklahoma.

The US eliminated measles in 2000. Elimination status would be lost if the US had 12 months of sustained transmission of the virus. As of 1 May, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 935 confirmed measles cases across 30 jurisdictions. Nearly one in three children under five years old involved in the outbreak, or 285 young children, have been hospitalized.

Donald Trump said he was weighing what actions to take after the European Union and Britain moved ahead with major new Russia sanctions, but he gave no further detail.

“We're looking at a lot of things, but we'll see,” Trump told reporters as he left Capitol Hill following a meeting with fellow Republicans about their tax bill.

The UK and Europe earlier announced major sanctions against Russia as it became clear that yesterday's call between Trump and Vladimir Putin had failed to deliver any meaningful concessions from Moscow.

The UK said its sanctions would target dozens of entities “supporting Russia's military machine, energy exports and information war, as well as financial institutions helping to fund Putin's invasion of Ukraine”.

Shortly after the EU approved sanctions targeting Russia's shadow fleet of about 200 vessels and said that more sanctions were in the pipeline.

Here is the moment Marco Rubio's Senate hearing was disrupted briefly by a pro-Palestine protester.

The Trump administration is working to reach an agreement that would allow Iran to have a civil nuclear energy program but not enrich uranium, secretary of state Marco Rubio said, but admitted that achieving such a deal “will not be easy.”

He told the Senate foreign relations committee that the administration was offering an “off-ramp” for Iran to pursue prosperity and peace.

It will not be easy, but that's the process we're engaged in now.

Secretary of state Marco Rubio told the Senate foreign relations committee that the Syrian transitional authority may be weeks away from potential collapse and full-scale civil war, defending Donald Trump's decision to lift Syria sanctions and to engage with the interim government in Damascus.

It is our assessment that, frankly, the transitional authority, given the challenges they're facing, are maybe weeks, not many months, away from potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions, basically the country splitting up.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

President William Lai (賴清德) highlighted the sense of threat that China poses to the world in his first foreign television interview since taking office a year ago.

In the interview, recorded on Sunday in Taipei and broadcast on Monday night on Nippon News Network's News Zero, host Sho Sakurai asked Lai about the possibility of a conflict with China.

The world now realizes that China is attempting to change the rules-based international order, with the annexation of Taiwan the first step, Lai said.

If Taiwan were to be invaded, the world supply chain would be disrupted, making it crucial that a cross-strait conflict is prevented, he said.

Asked whether the US would help defend Taiwan in a conflict, Lai did not offer a direct answer.

Former US “president [Joe] Biden and President [Donald] Trump have given the media different answers, but whether under the Biden administration or Trump administration, Taiwan-US ties have continued to get stronger,” Lai said.

World War II demonstrated the importance of improving Taiwan's defenses and using deterrence to maintain peace, he said.

“We have to prepare for war in order to avoid war,” he said.

As part of its efforts to deter an attack, Taiwan is developing uncrewed weapons to meet Taiwan's national security needs and to promote industrial development, he said.

The development of such weapons is not intended to help Taiwan invade China, but rather for self-defense, Lai said.

Taiwan and Japan have demonstrated strong bonds in helping each other to deal with disasters, he said, adding that the two sides can help each other overcome all kinds of hardships.

He expressed hope that the US, Japan and other democratic nations would unite to prevent China from starting a war.

“Prevention is more important than a cure,” he said.

The interview was part of a series dedicated to the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II titled “Keeping the Present from Becoming the Pre-war Era.”

Africa has established the continent's first space agency to boost Earth observation and data sharing at a time when a more hostile global context is limiting the availability of climate and weather information. 

The African Space Agency opened its doors last month under the umbrella of the African Union and is headquartered in Cairo. The new organization,  which is still being set up and hiring people in key positions, is to coordinate existing national space programs. It aims to improve the continent's space infrastructure by launching satellites, setting up weather stations and making sure data can be shared across Africa and beyond.

“Space activities on the continent have been happening in a very fragmented fashion,” said Meshack Kinyua, a space engineer and an Africa space policy veteran who now oversees capacity-building at the agency.

“The African Space Agency brings a coordination mechanism and economies of scale — it puts all members of the African Union at an equal level in terms of gathering data that they can access according to their needs,” Kinyua said.

Africa is the world's poorest continent and its people are among the most vulnerable to the extreme weather events made worse by climate change, despite contributing much less to the warming of the planet than those in developed countries. 

The lack of high-resolution weather and climate data prevents governments from alerting citizens when extreme weather events approach, and scientists cannot accurately predict long-term trends, because the data in their models lacks detail. 

The African Space Agency is a step toward changing that, Kinyua said. 

The agency also aims to scale up some successful initiatives happening across the continent, including early warnings systems for fishers in western Africa and in the Congo river basin, he said.

The agency had been long planned, but its opening comes right after the administration of US President Donald Trump's dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which was a significant funder of many different kinds of programs in Africa. 

When the administration canceled 80 percent of USAID's projects, among them was SERVIR, a joint initiative of USAID, NASA and space organizations in developing countries to help manage climate change, food security and natural disasters. 

“We need to ensure that African satellites can improve measurements and fill data gaps,” Kinyua said. “These gaps will always be there, and we need to fill some of them ourselves, and engage with other agencies.”

The African agency has already partnered with the European Space Agency to train experts and share knowledge, including on processing data and building satellites. 

In Europe, national space agencies share the cost of launching new Earth observation satellites, which can be as high as 800 million euros (US$900 million), said Benjamin Koetz, head of the long term action section at the European Space Agency. 

Countries then also share the knowledge gathered by the satellites.

“Every country doesn't need to invest and build the same satellite,” Koetz said.

Cairo launched the continent's first satellite in 1998, and since then, more than 20 African countries have set up their own space agencies. Eighteen of them have launched a total of 63 satellites. The African Union will fund the African Space Agency on a project-by-project basis.

“Getting financial resources is a challenge, because there's so much we need to do, and our resources are limited,” Kinyua said. “But we have to take baby steps before we start running.” 

Africa's space pioneers — which include Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa — took a long time to set up their agencies and start operating because they started from scratch, said Danielle Wood, an associate professor who directs the Space Enabled Research Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

“It shouldn't take that long now that many African countries have space experience, and hopefully the best outcome is that new countries can look at existing examples and coordinate to go faster,” she said. “Other players like the US and Europe will have their own agenda, but the African Space Agency will be African-focused, so it should help every country in Africa.”

Samobor, near the capital, Zagreb, has become the first in the country to run a “Grandmother-Grandfather Service,” which pays 360 euros (US$400) a month per child.
The scheme allows grandparents to top up their pension, but the authorities also hope it will boost family ties and tackle social isolation as the population ages.

The World Health Assembly yesterday adopted a landmark pandemic agreement on tackling future health crises, struck after more than three years of negotiations sparked by the COVID-19 crisis.

The accord aims to prevent the disjointed response and international disarray that surrounded the COVID-19 pandemic by improving global coordination and surveillance, and access to vaccines, in any future pandemics.

The WHO's decisionmaking annual assembly adopted the plan at its Geneva headquarters.

“It's an historic day,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said after the vote. 

The text of the agreement was finalized by consensus last month, following multiple rounds of tense negotiations.

The US pulled out of those talks, following President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw his country from the WHO, a process that takes one year to complete.

“The world is safer today thanks to the leadership, collaboration and commitment of our member states to adopt the historic WHO Pandemic Agreement,” Tedros said in a statement.

“The agreement is a victory for public health, science and multilateral action. It will ensure we, collectively, can better protect the world from future pandemic threats,” he said.

“It is also a recognition by the international community that our citizens, societies and economies must not be left vulnerable to again suffer losses like those endured during COVID-19,” he said.

The treaty faced a late challenge on Monday when Slovakia called for a vote, as its COVID-19 vaccine-skeptic prime minister demanded that his country challenge the adoption of the agreement.

A total of 124 countries voted in favor, no countries voted against, while 11 countries, including Poland, Israel, Italy, Russia, Slovakia and Iran, abstained.

The agreement aims to better detect and combat pandemics by focusing on greater international coordination and surveillance, and more equitable access to vaccines and treatments.

The negotiations grew tense amid disagreements between wealthy and developing countries, with the latter feeling cut off from access to vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The agreement faced opposition from those who thought it would encroach on state sovereignty.

Nations have until May next year to thrash out the details of the agreement's Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing (PABS) mechanism.

The PABS mechanism deals with sharing access to pathogens with pandemic potential, and then sharing of benefits derived from them: vaccines, tests and treatments.

Once the PABS system is finalized, the agreement can then be ratified. Sixty ratifications are required for the treaty to enter into force.

Precious Matsoso of South Africa and French Ambassador for Global Health Anne-Claire Amprou cochaired the talks process that led to the agreement.

“It is intended to create a rules-based, future-proof system that will stand the test of time. It does not, and will not, undermine the sovereignty of countries,” Matsoso told the assembly on Monday.

“In a time of growing geopolitical tensions and seismic changes, this agreement is proof that the world is still together,” she added.

The Hungarian parliament on May 20 supported a bill on launching Hungary's withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC).

The government-proposed bill, supported by 134 lawmakers, would see Hungary exit the international body that it co-founded in 2002. The Hague-based court is tasked with prosecuting international crimes of genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity.

The vote formalizes Hungary's intention, which was first announced in early April during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Budapest. The Hungarian government has sharply criticized the ICC's decision to issue an arrest warrant for the Israeli leader over alleged war crimes in Gaza.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has said that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will soon be notified of the decision. The withdrawal will be formalized one year after the secretary-general receives the written notification.

While the bill on the withdrawal was approved only on May 20, Szijjarto said already back in late April that the Hungarian legislature had backed the move to exit the ICC.

""With this decision, we refuse to be part of a politicized institution that has lost its impartiality and credibility,"" Szijjarto wrote at the time.

In March 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the forcible deportation of children from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine.

Despite the warrant, Mongolia hosted Putin for an official visit in September 2024, citing energy dependence as its reason for not executing the arrest and saying it had limited options.

The EU has formally approved its 17th package of sanctions imposed on Russia over aggression in Ukraine, including measures against almost 200 shadow fleet vessels, top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas announced on May 20.

""New measures also address hybrid threats and human rights. More sanctions on Russia are in the works,"" Kallas said on X.

The step comes as the U.S. signals disinterest in imposing additional sanctions against Russia, even as Moscow refuses Western-backed ceasefire proposals.

The 17th package was supported by EU ambassadors 
 last week, but has since then been criticized as weak and watered down.

The new sanctions target members of Russia's military and political elite and foreign entities in China or the United Arab Emirates, accused of helping the Kremlin evade already-imposed measures.

The EU will also sanction more than 20 entities and individuals disseminating disinformation, and 20 judges and prosecutors involved in legal cases against Russian opposition, specifically Vladimir Kara-Murza and late Alexei Navalny.

The package also targets components vital to Russia's defense industry, namely chemicals, materials, and dual-use goods.

The EU has threatened Russia with additional sanctions unless President Vladimir Putin commits to a ceasefire and agrees to seriously engage in peace efforts. President Volodymyr Zelensky also announced that a new ""strong EU sanctions package"" is underway.

While European leaders have proclaimed that additional sanctions are coordinated with Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump, who held a phone call with Putin on May 19, said he does not intend to impose new measures on Moscow to avoid disrupting peace efforts.


          We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war —
          and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information
          should be available to all.

A mysterious virus that slowly turns its victims into marble statues, their spines and legs hardening and cracking. A timeline-hopping narrative whose twin strands majestically cross over to the mournful soundtrack of The Mercy Seat by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. And more shots of hypodermic needles being jabbed into arms and chests than an endless loop of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. These are the indelible elements that make up French filmmaker Julia Ducournau's new horror-drama Alpha, which made an explosive landing at the Cannes Film Festival on Monday night, blowing all previous competitors out of the French Riviera water. 

The follow-up to Ducournau's 2021 pretzel of a body-horror movie Titane, which walked away with Cannes' prestigious Palme d'Or, Alpha sent the black-tie audience inside the Palais into a polite frenzy during its world premiere. 

So much so that an audience member in the balcony had to be tended to in the midst of the screening due to a medical emergency, echoing the moment when, in 2016, several moviegoers passed out during a Toronto International Film Festival screening of Ducournau's debut feature, Raw. (This time around, the moviegoer thankfully turned out to be fine, and the screening continued uninterrupted.)

At once a metaphor for the AIDS crisis and a meditation on the million little traumas that are inherited across families for generations, Alpha follows three characters in various states of distress: heroin addict Amin (Tahar Rahim), his physician sister (Golshifteh Farahani) and her troubled 13-year-old daughter Alpha (Melissa Boros), who one day comes home from a disreputable house party with a tattoo whose imprint sets off a chain of cataclysmic events.

While Titane proved that Ducournau was a devoted student of David Cronenberg, Alpha reveals the director has also been studying at the tomb of Clive Barker, especially when it comes to imagining the victims of the unnamed disease, their beautiful but tortured bodies resembling both the creatures of Nightbreed and the Cennobites of Hellraiser. 

There is, to put it lightly, a lot going on inside of Alpha‘s apocalyptic world, not nearly all of which is digestible upon first viewing – especially one that didn't get started until close to 11 p.m. But as the crowd rose to its feet to award an emotional Ducournau a rousing standing ovation – no one needs to time these things to the minute, but it lasted far longer than any other reception at Cannes so far – it was clear that Alpha had hit a nerve. 

Which, by this deep into the festival, needed to happen one way or another. While a few in-competition films have found admirers across the board, most notably the Brazilian thriller The Secret Agent, before Alpha hit the screen, there haven't been too many in-competition titles to get animated about, either on the pro or con side.

Wes Anderson's The Phoenician Scheme, which screened Sunday night, is an emotionally empty exercise in fussiness, a steep drop-off from Asteroid City. And Egyptian director Tarik Saleh's political satire Eagles of the Republic, which screened Monday afternoon, failed to deliver on its incendiary promise of roasting Cairo's corrupt class.

Instead, the best bets as Cannes began to enter its final leg were found outside of the “official competition” films competing for the Palme d'Or. 

In the sidebar Directors' Fortnight program, Canadian director Lloyd Lee Choi delivered a knockout with his drama Lucky Lu. In his feature-length debut, the director, who was recently named the winner of this year's TIFF-CBC Films Screenwriter Award, traces a disastrous 48-hour period for a New York delivery driver (Chang Chen) as he anticipates the arrival of his wife and young daughter from overseas. A potent mix of Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves and the Safdie brothers' Uncut Gems, Choi's film (not technically a Canadian title given it was produced in the U.S.) is excellent high-anxiety cinema. 

Also causing heart palpitations, in a good way, was Spike Lee's out-of-competition thriller Highest 2 Lowest. An extremely loose remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1958 drama High and Low, the Denzel Washington-starring film premiered Monday just a few hours before Alpha, a nice bit of festival symmetry given that Lee's jury awarded Ducournau her Palme d'Or in 2021. 

Once Lee pushed his new film's unbearably melodramatic score to the background and let Washington do what he does best – devour the screen with an unmatched ferocity – the film offered a sometimes silly but ultimately electric ride. Especially once Washington was able to pair off against hip-hop star A$AP Rocky, who plays an aspiring rapper to Washington's record-biz mogul. Alpha, meet Omega.

Ivan Kalmar is a professor at the University of Toronto's Department of Anthropology and Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy. He is the author of White But Not Quite: Central Europe's Illiberal Revolt.

Canada's recent federal election has brought into sharp focus the fact that Canada and the United States are not simply two different countries. They also represent two very different ideas – metaphors for different moral and political visions of how humans should relate to each other, to those who are different, and to the environment. 

The boundary between these visions does not coincide with the geographic border; it cuts across North America. There are “Canadians” in America and “Americans” in Canada. Canadians will routinely say that multiculturalism is central to their self-image, while the United States is “a melting pot” – a place that expects people of all races, colours and creeds to dissolve their heritage in order to become American. But while there are many Canadian values, as described by Prime Minister Mark Carney when he celebrated his election victory last month, including “kindness as a virtue,” “cultural institutions” such as the public broadcaster, and “universal public health care,” many Americans hold these values as well. Many strive to have the same kind of public services that most Canadians are proud of. Bernie Sanders, for example, has long argued for a health-care system modeled on Canada's.

In both countries, what “Canada” stands for is a liberal democracy that is inclusive of people of all races, ethnicities, languages, genders and sexual orientations. And in both countries, “America” under Trump now stands for exclusivist, anti-migrant nationalism and a return to patriarchal gender relations. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whose authoritarian rule has been publicly acknowledged by Donald Trump and his entourage as a model, calls this an “illiberal democracy.” Illiberal movements rightly point to the many failures of the liberal democratic West, and as a remedy, they propose economic nationalism. In America, this means hoping (in vain) for the restoration of economic security by restricting foreign competition through tariffs. It also means removing and keeping out migrants, believing that this will bring investments and jobs back to the country and make it “great again” for those who “purely” belong.

In short, “Canada” as an idea stands today for liberal democracy, and “America” for illiberalism. This – not the trade balance or fentanyl – is the real reason Mr. Trump wants to do away with Canada; he also wants to do away with what “Canada” represents, in his own country.

Today's contest between “America” and “Canada,” then – as ideas and not only countries – is the North American arena of a broader conflict between liberal democracy and illiberalism. In this global struggle, Canada has come to be the bane of the reactionary illiberal right.

My first awareness of this came during my research on illiberalism in Poland during the so-called “European migration crisis” five or six years ago. A parish priest who was the spiritual advisor of a militant Catholic nationalist youth association was interviewed by one of my research assistants, who had himself been a member. Justifying sentiments against Muslim migration to Poland, the clergyman exclaimed, “we are not in Canada,” using the country as a metaphor for multiculturalism.

Since then, I have noted a rise of negative portrayals of Canada on the internet. There are many videos on YouTube and on social media discouraging others from moving to Canada due to cultural differences, high prices, or intolerable crime (false); some of these concerns are real, while others are manufactured. I have even seen videos about Canada's terrible economy and the disadvantages of moving there that are scripted in Spanish and other languages. This could well be a part of a concerted campaign of anti-Canadian propaganda spread from the United States or, perhaps, like many illiberal ideas, from Russia; I am currently researching this possibility. But regardless of its origins, the idea of Canada being “broken,” in Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's words, owes much to homegrown, Canadian illiberal opinion makers. After Mr. Trump's assaults on Canada, Liberals were able to seize on this kind of Conservative criticism as unjustified and unpatriotic – and the election showed that millions of Canadians agreed.

Canadians understand that the challenge now is to preserve not only the nation of Canada, but also the idea of “Canada,” which remains radically opposed to that of Mr. Trump's “America.” Mr. Carney, a respected former head of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, seemed, to many voters, the one best qualified to do the job. We will see now whether he can defend Canada – both the country and the idea.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Romania: Historic victory for pro-European candidate","https://www.dw.com/en/romania-historic-victory-for-pro-european-candidate/a-72599369","Tue, 20 May 2025 08:21:09 GMT","

In an unexpected turn of events, the pro-European, democratic candidate Nicusor Dan has been elected president of Romania. He intends to strengthen the rule of law and supports Ukraine.

Thousands of jubilant people gathered on Queen Elizabeth Boulevard in the Romanian capital, Bucharest, on Sunday evening to celebrate.

Waving Romanian and EU flags, they repeatedly chanted the first name of the man who had just won the presidential election: ""Nicusor! Nicusor!""

The man in question, Nicusor Dan, appeared on a balcony, waving an EU flag and greeting supporters below. Finally, at half past midnight, he appeared outside the door of the building to thunderous applause.

In his usual uncharismatic, unpretentious yet approachable manner, the president-elect thanked his supporters. He then turned his attention to those who had not voted for him, saying: ""I invite you to help build Romania together.""

There was nothing triumphalist about Dan's brief address: ""Let us continue to believe in Romania,"" he concluded, ""and get to work tomorrow!""

Nicusor Dan is a mathematician and former civic activist who became mayor of Bucharest and then ran for the presidency as an independent candidate.

His win is unexpected, with the 55-year-old coming from far behind in the polls to win the second round of the election, catching up in a way no electoral candidate in Romania has ever done before.

After the first round of the election two weeks ago, Dan was a whole 20% behind his opponent, the right-wing extremist George Simion, in Sunday's runoff.

But Dan obviously won over several million voters in the intervening period, winning the second round with about 54% of the vote to Simion's 46%.

This is good news for Romania, the European Union and, in particular, Ukraine.

Simion, a former football hooligan and pro-Russian right-wing extremist who openly supports US President Donald Trump and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, got 41% of the vote in the first round and was hotly tipped to win the second round, too.

Had he won, he would have led Romania, the most populous country in southeastern Europe, on an isolationist, anti-European, hard-right path. Ultimately, it would seem, the majority of Romanian voters were put off by this prospect.

Dan, on the other hand, also benefited from his reputation as the honest candidate, a former activist who fought Bucharest's real estate mafia and is not part of the despised ""establishment"" with its corrupt party cronyism that has dominated Romania for the past 30 years.

Other things that obviously bolstered Dan's election campaign were the fact that he made a level-headed impression on people in his public appearances, made no exaggerated promises and showed interest in the concerns of all sections of society, while at the same time holding fast to his stance on the rule of law, Europe and support for Ukraine.

As a young man, Dan won two gold medals at the International Mathematical Olympiad. He is a practicing Christian and someone who prefers not to raise exaggerated expectations or make bombastic statements.

His views are largely liberal and occasionally moderately conservative. When giving a speech, he sometimes ties himself in knots trying to explain complex problems. He is capable of admitting mistakes and despite sticking to his principles, remains undogmatic.

Dan has lived with his partner out of wedlock for the past 20 years — something which does not always go down well in rural Romania in particular. The couple have two children.

Dan's blend of down-to-earth honesty, obstinacy, pinch of traditionalism, genuine humility and dependability obviously made him electable for voters across the spectrum.

As promised during his election campaign, Dan announced after his victory that he would be holding talks on the formation of a government with ""all four democratic parties"" in the Romanian parliament.

By these, he meant the Social Democrats, the National Liberals, the progressive liberal Save Romania Union and the party of the Hungarian minority, the UDMR, and representatives of other minorities.

Dan has said that he will appoint as prime minister Ilie Bolojan of the National Liberal Party. Bolojan has been interim president for the past few months and was formerly the mayor of the western Romanian city of Oradea.

Voter turnout for the runoff was 64%, which was relatively high in comparison to the 53% recorded in the first round. A lot of people went to cast their vote on Sunday, particularly in the cities.

The vast majority of commentators agreed that the election was a ""referendum on Romania's fundamental course"" and that the majority of people had opted for the European path.

One group of experts on the television channel Digi24, described the election as a ""battle between democracy and autocracy-kleptocracy.""

Political scientist Costin Ciobanu said that democracy in Romania was the winner in this election, adding, however, that ""it had not been saved by established parties; it was the people that saved the country.""

Romania-watchers also see the election result as a defeat for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

Speaking on May 9, Orban gave his backing to right-wing extremist Simion, despite the fact that the latter is known for violent actions against Romania's Hungarian minority.

This resulted for the first time in many years in a conflict between the party of the Hungarian minority of Romania, the UDMR, and Orban. Dan's biggest victory in Romania on Sunday was in Harghita, which is predominantly inhabited by ethnic Hungarians. Some 90% voted for him.

Dan's second-best result came in the Republic of Moldova, the ""second Romanian state,"" where many people also hold Romanian citizenship; around 88% of them voted for Dan.

Moldovan President Maia Sandu, who also holds Romanian citizenship, was one of the first foreign heads of state or government to congratulate Dan. ""Romania, we walk together with confidence on the European path,"" she posted on Facebook.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was also among the first to congratulate Dan on his ""historic victory.""

""By working together, we can strengthen both our countries and our Europe,"" Zelenskyy posted on X.

George Simion is barred from entering both the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine because he questions the statehood of both countries and has called for the annexation of both Moldova and parts of Ukraine.

On Sunday evening, Simion declared himself the new president of Romania.

But at about 2 a.m. on Monday, he conceded defeat and congratulated Dan, indirectly signaling that he and his Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) were not planning to revolt over the election result.

Many observers emphasized, however, that the over 5 million Romanian citizens who voted for Simion — almost half of the electorate — cannot be ignored.

Ioan Stanomir, an expert on constitutional law, told Digi24 ""This will be the start of a difficult time of governance, and bridges will have to be built to the people who voted for Simion.""

Nicusor Dan said something similar in his first interviews and in his speech shortly after midnight.

He said that he had ""respect"" for everyone who had not voted for him and wanted to enter into dialogue with them. ""Romania will have a new president,"" he said, ""a president who will be in equilibrium with all other powers of state and who will continue to need you all.""

New figures show a ""dramatic"" increase in racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic crimes in Germany. Meanwhile, three men in Munich are going on trial for allegedly spying for Russia. DW rounds up the latest.

Germany has recorded a sharp rise in politically motivated crime, according to new figures.

Natalie Pawlik, the government commissioner for anti-racism, decried a ""dramatic"" increase in racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic crimes in the country.

Meanwhile, three German-Russian dual nationals have gone on trial in Munich. They are accused of planning sabotage plots against military infrastructure and railway lines in Germany.

Here is a roundup of top news stories from Germany on Tuesday, May 20.

The male suspect in a knife attack last weekend outside a bar in the western city of Bielefeld was remanded in custody Tuesday on suspicion of attempted murder.

A judge ordered the suspect to remain in custody for ""four counts of attempted murder in conjunction with dangerous bodily harm.""

Investigators were still searching for a motive behind the stabbing early Sunday morning, which left four people seriously injured.

Prosecutors said their investigations into the motive also include a ""possible Islamist background to the offence.""

Police say there is a ""strong suspicion"" that the suspect, who has been identified as a 35-year-old man of Syrian origin, tried to kill ""at least four people with a knife and a spear-like object"" during the knife attack. 

The attack injured five people aged between 22 and 27, with four of the alleged victims sustaining serious injuries, including two that were life-threatening.

Police said Monday that their conditions had since stabilized. 

Germany's interior minister Alexander Dobrindt has said a recent assessment by the country's domestic intelligence agency classifying the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as a ""right-wing extremist"" organization is insufficient to justify a ban on the party.

Earlier this month, the BfV upgraded the AfD's status from ""suspected"" to ""confirmed right-wing extremist"" because the party ""disregards human dignity"" and is a threat to German democracy.

The BfV then said it would refrain from using the ""right-wing extremist"" label to refer to the AfD until a court rules on an appeal by the party.

If the court rules in favor of the BfV, the far-right, anti-immigration party — which has made historic gains in recent years to become the second largest party in the German parliament — would be subject to surveillance by domestic intelligence services.

The BvF's classification has renewed a national debate over whether the party should be banned.

But Dobrindt argued Tuesday that the intelligence report that underpinned the BvF's assessment primarily focused on whether the AfD violates the principle of human dignity and did not have enough evidence to justify a ban. 

Banning a political party, Dobrindt said, would also require evidence that it poses a threat to democracy or the rule of law. 

The interior minister said the BvF report did not address these two points.

Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has also cast doubt on whether banning a party that came second in February's federal election would be appropriate.

German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil on Tuesday called for international trade disputes to be resolved as quickly as possible.

Klingbeil made the remarks in Berlin before departing for Banff, Canada, where he is due to attend a G7 finance ministers' meeting — his first major foreign trip since he was appointed this month.

The aggressive tariffs policy pursued by US President Donald Trump has caused significant market turmoil and doubts about long-standing international trade relations.

""Tariffs and uncertainties are a burden on our economy and therefore also on job security,"" Klingbeil said, as he called for trade disputes to be resolved ""as quickly as possible.""

Klingbeil said German authorities, along with its European allies and the European Commission (EC), are in talks with the US on resolving the trade dispute sparked by Trump's tariffs.

In April, Trump said he would start imposing taxes on imports from nearly all countries. He announced tariffs of 20% on the European Union, before pausing them for 90 days.

Germany and the EU are working on an agreement with Washington before the 90-day pause ends.

""At the same time, as the largest single market in the world, we are determined to defend our interests,"" Klingbeil said.

EC President Ursula von der Leyen met with US Vice President JD Vance on the sidelines of Pope Leo XIV's inaugural Mass on Sunday, with the pair discussing a possible EU-US trade deal.

Three men accused of spying for Russia have denied the charges on the first day of their espionage trial in Munich on Tuesday.

The three defendants — all dual German-Russian nationals — denied accusations of plotting sabotage attacks against military infrastructure and railway lines in Germany.

The suspects allegedly collected intelligence about an oil refinery and a US military training area, which are both located in Bavaria, the southern German state of which Munich is the capital and largest city. 

They are also accused of planning to detonate explosives at buildings and other infrastructure used to support Ukraine in the war against Russia.

Police first arrested two of them, identified* as Dieter S. and Alexander J., in Bavaria last year. The third defendant, Alex D., was arrested separately. 

A defense lawyer for Dieter S., who is believed to have been the leader of the three defendants, told the court that their client ""is not a spy, he is not a saboteur.""

The 40-year-old suspect, who denied having any links to Russian intelligence or espionage operations, argued that he had thought he would be able to earn money as an informant.

""He thought he could do a bit of acting and pretend to be a spy,"" the lawyer added.

Dieter S. is also denied being involved in any military activity in eastern Ukraine between 2014 and 2016 with an armed terrorist organization. 

The other two defendants — identified as Alexander J. and Alex. D who are believed to have helped Dieter S. — also denied the espionage charges, but have admitted to some of the alleged offences. 

Germany's domestic intelligence agency has said Russian espionage and disinofrmation activity within Germany has sharply increased since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said the new figures on politically motivated crime underlined an urgent need for major security action.

""The unprecedented increase in the number of politically motivated crimes is a worrying development that we are combating with the utmost consistency and determination,"" he said.  

""The high number of antisemitic crimes, in particular, is unacceptable,"" he added. The figures released Tuesday showed a nearly 21% increase in antisemitic crimes in 2024 compared to the year before. 

Dobrindt noted that politically motivated crimes were spreading ""fear and terror"" and causing volunteers and politicians to cease their work. 

""The current statistics once again underscore the urgent need for a joint security offensive by the federal and state governments — a true turning point in domestic security.""

Dobrindt, a member of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) party, was sworn in as interior minister earlier this month.

He has advocated for stricter migration policies, and has previously defended former Interior Minister Horst Seehofer's statement that ""Islam does not belong to Germany."" 

Germany recorded a 40% rise in politically motivated crime in 2024 compared to the year before, according to figures released Tuesday.

Of the total figure, 42,788 were right-wing extremist, amounting to nearly 50% of politically motivated crimes. 

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said the ""extreme"" increase in figures was ""driven by the polarization of our society"" and by the rise of antisemitism.

Natalie Pawlik, the government commissioner for anti-racism, decried a ""dramatic"" increase in racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic crimes in Germany.  

""Hitler salutes, incitement to hatred, punches in the face — a right-wing crime every 12 minutes in our country,"" she said. 

Pawlik called on the federal government and German states to work on further prevention and political education against such crimes. 

""And everyone in this country has a duty not to turn a blind eye to right-wing extremism and racism,"" she said, urging people to ""intervene in incidents on buses or trains and to defend our peaceful coexistence in a diverse country.""

""The figures are a bitter reality, but they must never become the norm.""

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said the phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin showed that Moscow was still not willing to make concessions to end the war in Ukraine. 

""There is still no sign of a ceasefire,"" Pistorius said on the sidelines of the meeting of EU defense ministers in Brussels. 

Putin said that Russia was prepared to work out a ""memorandum"" with the Ukrainian government to prepare a ""possible future peace agreement"" between the two states.

But Pistorius argued he no longer judged ""words,"" but ""deeds and actions."" This would ""help us all more than speculating about the seriousness of intentions,"" he said.

Pistorius made the remarks in Brussels, where he is attending a meeting of EU defense ministers. Among other topics, the ministers are discussing further support for Ukraine and the EU's defense capabilities. 

EU foreign ministers are also meeting later on Tuesday to discuss further sanctions against Russia.

The Czech Republic won against Germany 5-0 on Monday evening, remaining unbeaten at the ice hockey world championship. 

The win put the Czech Republic at the top of Group B, followed by Switzerland and the US. 

On Tuesday, Germany will face Denmark in a game that will decide which team qualifies to the quarterfinals. 

Police in the western city of Bielefeld said they arrested a suspect after an attack outside a bar left several people injured. 

Authorities had been searching for the suspect, whom they identified as a 35-year-old Syrian man, since early Sunday. 

According to investigators, the man is said to have randomly attacked revelers outside a bar in downtown Bielefeld with a sharp object, injuring at least five people before going on the run.

Police said the suspect left behind a bag containing personal documents and a bottle containing a liquid that smelled of gasoline.

The attack has drawn speculation that the suspect did not act spontaneously but had planned an attack.

Police said they may provide further information on Tuesday. 

The trial of three men accused of spying for Russia is due to begin at a regional court in the southern city of Munich. 

The trio, all German-Russian dual nationals, are also charged with planning sabotage plots against military infrastructure and railway lines in Germany.

Police first arrested two of them, identified* as Dieter S. and Alexander J., in Bavaria last year. The third defendant, Alex D., was arrested separately. 

The main suspect in the case is Dieter S., who is believed to have been at the center of sabotage plots, while the other two are alleged to have helped him.

Prosecutors have also charged Dieter S. with ""membership in a foreign terrorist organization"" for allegedly belonging to a pro-Russian militia in eastern Ukraine between 2014 and 2016.

According to prosecutors, it was during this time that he came into contact with Russian intelligence services. 

The trial kicks off Tuesday at the Higher Regional Court in Munich at 10 a.m. local time (0800 UTC). Over 40 hearings are scheduled until December.

It vowed to continue imposing visa restrictions on representatives of travel agencies in order to ""cut off alien smuggling networks.""

The visa restriction would even apply to individuals who would otherwise qualify for a Visa Waiver Program, the State Department said, in reference to those exempt from needing a tourist visa to visit the US for up to 90 days.

""Enforcing US immigration laws and policies is critical to upholding the rule of law and protecting Americans,"" Bruce said in the statement.

Since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House this year, his administration has significantly cracked down on migration, deporting thousands of migrants, including in certain cases that defied court rulings.

Social media outfits of US embassies worldwide have been warning US visa holders not to overstay the duration of their visas, and stressing that they would otherwise risk deportation and a permanent ban.

Signing off on the final routine medical examination of Joe Biden's presidency, physician Kevin O'Connor declared the former US president to be a “healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male”.

But the diagnosis of an aggressive form of prostate cancer, said only to have been discovered last week, has raised questions over the transparency of White House physicians and their personal loyalty to the presidents they serve.

It is unclear whether the former president was screened for prostate cancer during his presidency and health bodies have warned that PSA testing is often unreliable.

As with all presidents, the responsibility of their medical care lies with the White House physician, who serves as the personal doctor to the leader of the free world.

They run a military-like operation providing round-the-clock medical care to the president, often accompanying them on Air Force One during domestic and international trips.

Among their biggest jobs is to perform an annual physical exam performed at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre to determine if the president is fit for office.

Stringent and thorough, they test everything from the president's general health, to their neurological and cognitive ability.

For decades, the White House has publicly released the results of the president's annual physical, listing their medications and other basic details about their health status.

But administrations have great discretion over what to include in the releases, given that there is no federal law requiring US presidents to release their health records.

In turn, some reports have faced questions over their accuracy.

At the centre of Mr Biden's medical care is Dr O'Connor, who has had a close relationship with the Biden family that dates back to 2009.

The man Mr Biden simply calls “Doc” treated Mr Biden's mother after she fell ill while recovering from hip surgery. Years later, he is said to have consulted with Mr Biden's niece about an eye problem.

His relationship with Mr Biden grew as he shadowed the medical team involved in the treatment of his son Beau's brain cancer.

As Beau's condition worsened, Dr O'Connor was the family's “eyes and ears” at the hospital, according to the memoir Promise me Dad.

He would go on to become a voice of reason for the former president. When Mr Biden developed a fever ahead of trip to Central America, he described in his memoir how Dr O'Connor urged him not to travel and to rest instead.

“Right now, you look like s---. I can't make you not look like s---,” Mr Biden recounted. He ultimately took this advice.

He was initially contracted to be Mr Biden's physician for just six months when the Obama administration began in 2009.

“That didn't work out and, so, I ended up doing the whole eight years with him,” Dr O'Connor joked in an interview last year with the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine about his role as the president's chief physician.

Mr Biden brought Dr O'Connor back to the White House when he became president in 2021.

“I retired and had a plan, and here I am again,” Dr O'Connor, who grew up in New Jersey, said at the time.

Outside of the White House, Dr O'Connor is said to have worked closely with James Biden, the president's brother, at a company that operated rural hospitals.

The stocky former army surgeon was always close to his number one patient, ready to provide care as needed though few outside the building would know who he is.

But Mr Biden's politically crippling debate performance changed all that. It was he, just four months before the disastrous debate that unfolded in front of that world, who had overseen Mr Biden's most recent physical exam in 2024 insisting the president at the time “continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations”.

Since then, a new book based on the accounts of White House insiders, Original Sin, claimed that aides shielded the public from the extent of Mr Biden's decline.

Donald Trump questioned the medical assessments carried out by Dr O'Connor during a press conference in the Oval Office on Monday evening.

He said: “I think that if you take a look, it's the same doctor that said that Joe was cognitively fine. ‘There was nothing wrong with him'. If it's the same doctor, he said, there was nothing wrong there, and that's being proven to be a sad situation.”

“And I think somebody is going to have to speak to his doctor if it's the same or even if it's two separate doctors. Why wasn't the cognitive ability? Why wasn't that discussed? And I think the doctor said ‘he's just fine', and it's turned out that's not so, it's very dangerous,” he added.

Dr Zeke Emanuel, vice provost for global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania told The Telegraph: “We have a long history of where the illnesses of presidents have been hidden from the public.

“​​We need an independent group of doctors, three doctors, not chosen by the president and not politicised.”

			LaMonica McIver denounces charge as ‘purely political' and says prosecutors are distorting her actions to deter legislative oversight

A Democrat congresswoman has been charged with assaulting federal agents outside a migrant detention centre.

The justice department has accused LaMonica McIver of assaulting, impeding or interfering with law enforcement following a demonstration outside the facility in Newark, New Jersey.

Ms McIver and two other Democratic lawmakers were protesting outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Delaney Hall centre on May 9 when a confrontation broke out as a member of the group was asked to leave.

Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, was arrested and later released after spending several hours in custody, while Ms McIver, a representative for New Jersey's 10th congressional district, became embroiled in a heated discussion with uniformed officials.

“I have persistently made efforts to address these issues without bringing criminal charges and have given Representative McIver every opportunity to come to a resolution, but she has unfortunately declined,” US attorney Alina Habba wrote in a letter, posted on X.

“No one is above the law – politicians or otherwise.”

The charges against Ms McIver mark a rare federal criminal case against a member of Congress.

Ms McIver has denied any wrongdoing and accused federal agents of escalating the situation by arresting Mr Baraka.

She also denounced the charge as “purely political” and said prosecutors are distorting her actions in an effort to deter legislative oversight.

“This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right,” she said in a statement.

“I am thankful for the outpouring of support I have received and I look forward to the truth being laid out clearly in court.”

A two-minute clip released by the Department of Homeland Security shows Ms McIver shouting “surround the mayor”.

At one point, her elbows push into an officer wearing a dark face covering, but it is not clear if the contact was accidental or intentional.

Asked about the charges on Tuesday, Donald Trump said Ms McIver was “totally out of control” and that “the days of woke are over”.

“She was shoving federal agents,” the president claimed.

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, wrote on X that Ms McIver had been charged following a “thorough review of the video footage”.

“Assaults on federal law enforcement will not be tolerated,” Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, posted on X. “This administration will always protect those who work tirelessly to keep America safe.”

Ms McIver's lawyer called the decision to charge her “spectacularly inappropriate”, saying she went to Delaney Hall “to do her job” as a member of Congress to oversee the treatment of ICE detainees.

“Rather than facilitating that inspection, ICE agents chose to escalate what should have been a peaceful situation into chaos,” Paul Fishman, the former US attorney for New Jersey, said in a statement.

“This prosecution is an attempt to shift the blame for ICE's behaviour to Congresswoman McIver. In the courtroom, facts — not headlines — will matter.”

Ms Habba agreed to dismiss a misdemeanour charge against Mr Baraka “for the sake of moving forward” and invited the mayor to tour the detention centre alongside her.

“The citizens of New Jersey deserve unified leadership so we can get to work to keep our state safe,” Ms Habba said.

Mr Baraka released a statement saying he would “continue to advocate for the humane treatment of detainees” and “continue to press the facility to ensure that it is compliant with City of Newark codes and regulations”.

Israel allowed just five aid trucks into Gaza on Monday, but none of the aid has reached people in need.

Thousands of babies in Gaza may die over the next two days if Israel does not lift its near-total humanitarian aid blockade and allow the entry of a flood of food and other basic necessities, the UN's humanitarian chief warned on Tuesday.

“There are 14,000 babies that will die in the next 48 hours unless we can reach them,” said Tom Fletcher, the UN's under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, in an interview on the BBC. 

“This is not food that Hamas is going to steal,” Fletcher went on, contradicting Israel's narrative about humanitarian aid. “We run the risk of looting, we run the risk of being hit as part of the Israeli military offensive, we run all sorts of risks trying to get that baby food to those mothers who cannot feed their children right now because they're malnourished.”

The interview came after Israel allowed the entry of just five aid trucks into Gaza on Monday — a “drop in the ocean” of what Palestinians need. But any small measure of relief those supplies may bring is moot as even those trucks haven't reached any Palestinians so far, Fletcher said. 

“Let's be clear, those five trucks are just sat on the other side of the border right now, they've not reached the communities they need to reach,” Fletcher said.

Meanwhile, the UN has said that there are thousands of trucks carrying crucial goods like baby food lined up and ready for entry at Gaza's border, just miles away from the babies Israel is starving.

The UN said that Israel has cleared 100 trucks to enter Gaza on Tuesday — still a far cry from the hundreds of trucks per day that humanitarian groups say are needed to fulfill basic needs and relieve starvation for millions of Palestinians in the Strip. 

Though the trucks have theoretically been approved for entry, Israel may still block the trucks from entering the region; indeed, though Fletcher said on Monday that Israel had approved the entry of nine trucks, only five were ultimately allowed in.

The starvation crisis in Gaza is dire, with food insecurity experts warning that the entire region is on the brink of or experiencing famine after nearly three months of Israel's total aid blockade. It has been over a month since the UN said that its agencies had given out its last food stores in the region, with community kitchens forced to shutter their operations in recent weeks as a result.

Many Palestinians say that the starvation is even worse than Israel's bombardments, having been starved by varying levels of Israel's blockade for 19 months and with food costs constantly on the rise. The total aid blockade ushered in the worst conditions of the genocide so far; one Palestinian reporter said in March that children in the region are so hungry that they're drawing pictures of food in the sand.

The World Food Programme has estimated that there are 14,000 children in Gaza with severe acute malnutrition, a deadly condition marked by a skeletal appearance and extreme weight loss, causing damage that can last a lifetime if untreated. According to an assessment by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, nearly 71,000 children are expected to experience acute malnutrition in the next year due to Israel's blockade.

The baseless charges “should send a chill down the spine of every American,” said Rep. Greg Casar.

U.S. President Donald Trump's Justice Department announced Monday that it is pursuing assault charges against a Democratic congresswoman from New Jersey who took part in an oversight visit at a privately run migrant detention center in Newark earlier this month.

In a statement, Interim U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Alina Habba announced the charges against U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.), claiming the lawmaker “assaulted, impeded, and interfered with law enforcement” at GEO Group's Delaney Hall. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) awarded GEO Group a billion-dollar contract earlier this year to detain migrants there, even as the facility faced legal challenges and accusations of abuse.

McIver rejected the charges against her as “purely political,” saying that “they mischaracterize and distort my actions” in an attempt to “criminalize and deter legislative oversight.”

“We were fulfilling our lawful oversight responsibilities, as members of Congress have done many times before, and our visit should have been peaceful and short,” said McIver. “Instead, ICE agents created an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation when they chose to arrest Mayor [Ras] Baraka.”

Habba said Monday that her office has agreed to drop the trespassing charge against Baraka, who welcomed the decision while expressing solidarity with McIver.

“Congresswoman McIver is a daughter of Newark, past Newark Council president, a former student of mine, and a dear friend,” said Baraka. “I want to be clear: I stand with LaMonica, and I fully expect her to be vindicated.”

The U.S. attorney's announcement sparked an outpouring of support for McIver and grave warnings about the implications of the Trump administration's attempt to prosecute her and other officials who try to stand in the way of its lawless mass deportation effort.

“This is a clear political attack on Rep. LaMonica McIver for having the courage to stand up to Trump's abuses of power,” said Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party. “Let's be clear who the real lawbreakers are. In just the last week, both Donald Trump and [Attorney General] Pam Bondi have been caught with a hand in the cookie jar. Bondi sold millions of shares of stock on the same day that Trump announced his disastrous tariffs. And Trump accepted a $400 million luxury plane from the Qatari royal family.”

“The most corrupt administration in our country's history is targeting and punishing public officials who seek to hold them accountable,” Mitchell added.

McIver's fellow congressional Democrats also rallied to her defense.

Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) called the charges a “purely political act” and said that “oversight is not a criminal offense unless you are living under a fascist regime.”

The chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas), said that “the baseless charges against Congresswoman McIver for simply doing her job should send a chill down the spine of every American.”

A group of Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee warned that “charging members of Congress for doing our jobs is a dangerous precedent to set.”

“It reveals the increasingly authoritarian nature of this administration and its relentless, illegal attempts to suppress any dissent or oversight, including from judges, members of Congress, and the American people, which check lawless executive power,” the lawmakers said. “Representative McIver has our full support, and we will do everything in our power to help fight this outrageous threat to our constitutional system.”

The scene at Delaney Hall earlier this month was highly chaotic, with video footage showing jostling and heated verbal exchanges outside of the facility's gate as federal agents moved to arrest Baraka after three New Jersey lawmakers — McIver and Reps. Robert Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman — visited the inside of the detention center, which they have a right to do under federal law.

The Department of Homeland Security released a video claiming to show McIver “assaulting” an ICE agent, and one DHS official accused the Democratic lawmaker of “body-slamming” and “body-ramming” officers. McIver, who rejected the claims, said at the time that federal agents at the scene were “roughing up members of Congress.”

Watson Coleman, who is 80 years old, said she was “manhandled” by ICE agents as they moved to arrest Baraka.

In a statement late Monday, Mike Zamore of the national ACLU and Amol Sinha of ACLU-NJ said that “the Trump administration's political charges against Congresswoman McIver [are] a method more suited for authoritarianism than American democracy.”

“If the Trump administration can target elected officials who oppose its extreme agenda, it can happen to any one of us,” they said. “We demand that they drop the charges against Rep. McIver, and we implore her fellow members of Congress to call for the same.”

“The real aim is to make it impossible for the Palestinians to return to these areas,” says a coauthor of the report.

A damning new report reveals how Israel is systematically making Gaza unlivable. The independent news outlet +972 Magazine has spoken to Israeli soldiers who describe how they have been using bulldozers and explosives to intentionally flatten Gaza.

In the southern city of Rafah, 73% of buildings are completely destroyed, with only about 4% of the infrastructure remaining undamaged. “The real aim is to make it impossible for the Palestinians to return to these areas,” says Meron Rapoport, co-author of the +972 Magazine report.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

We turn now to a new report that reveals how Israel is trying to make Gaza unlivable. It's been well documented that Israeli airstrikes account for mass casualties. Now the independent news outlet +972 Magazine has spoken to Israeli soldiers who reveal new details about how they've been systematically using bulldozers and explosives to flatten Gaza from the ground. For example, Gaza's Government Media Office says the Israeli army has destroyed at least 90% of residential neighborhoods in the southern city of Rafah.

The +972 report features videos Israeli soldiers shared online, like this one by Avraham Zarviv, who operates a D9 armored bulldozer. His nickname is “Flattener of Jabalia” — the northern town of Jabaliya in Gaza. In this video, he uses his camera to show a flattened landscape in Rafah.

AVRAHAM ZARVIV: [translated] Very good, Givati Brigade, very good. Yes, Rafah. “Rafah, end,” as they say. There will be no more battle in Rafah, because there will be no more Rafah. The nation of Israel lives.

AMY GOODMAN: For more, we're joined in Tel Aviv by Meron Rapoport, editor and writer at the independent Israeli news site Local Call and a columnist at +972 Magazine, where his new piece with Oren Ziv is headlined “'Render it unusable': Israel's mission of total urban destruction.”

Meron, welcome back to Democracy Now! Why don't you lay out what you found and these — the access you had, well, because they post them online publicly, to these Israeli soldiers' actual video accounts themselves of what they're doing in Gaza?

MERON RAPOPORT: I think that Gaza is being destroyed, and is already destroyed. This is not really new. We know that. We know that there are very few buildings standing in Rafah. What we have discovered in this investigation, Oren Ziv and I, is that this is a premeditated — that most of it is premeditated, that this is the routine work of soldiers today, or in the last year, or maybe more than a year, since the beginning of 2024. The routine work is to destroy, that this is what they are doing as a routine army service. They go out in the morning. They either accompany bulldozers or a unit that is responsible for explosives. They go, choose buildings and flatten them in a systematic way, and that the aim is quite — it is being said to them — of course, this is not official orders coming from the general headquarters of the Israeli army, but this is very bluntly told — they are being told, and they are themselves very proud of it, that the real aim is to make it impossible for the Palestinian to return to these areas. We have seen that now in these days in Rafah. In Rafah, we are telling that 4% of the buildings in Rafah are unhurt, undamaged. Only 4%, a city of 210,000, 200,000 people before the war. So, it is a systematic thing. It is not done by — it's not during battle. It's not even a result of airstrikes, although, of course, airstrikes are responsible for some of the damage. It is a planned thing. And in this, I think it is unprecedented.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Meron, you open your piece quoting a soldier you identify only as “Y.,” and he describes the demolition methods — and I'm quoting you — you write, quote, “I secured four or five bulldozers [from another unit], … they demolished 60 houses per day.” Six-oh. “A one or two story house, they take down within an hour; a three or four-story house takes a bit longer. … The official mission was to open a logistical route for maneuvering, but in practice, the bulldozers were simply destroying homes.” So, this is — to reiterate what you said, this is not in the process of a battle. This is supposedly after, let's say, there's been a battle or conflict, what the Israeli soldiers are doing. So, this is total ethnic cleansing of an entire territory, is effectively what they're doing, isn't it?

MERON RAPOPORT: Effectively, yes. Of course, this goes into some gray zone in the international law, what is called domicide, the destruction of whole urban areas. It is not officially a crime against humanity. It is certainly against the laws of war to destroy buildings that have nothing to do with military action. But, yes, I think this — there is no doubt that the intention here is ethnic cleansing. The intention here is to make these cities — Rafah, Jabaliya, the Netzarim Corridor, for the moment — maybe we are seeing something new in the next days — but to make these areas completely impossible — it will be completely impossible for the population to come back, because there is nothing left. And it is being said quite openly by the soldiers, by the videos that they air themselves, by soldiers who spoke to us. It is quite clear that this is the intention.

Now, the IDF, in its official response to us, said that, “No, this is a part of operational — there's operational needs that require this demolitions of houses, and this has to do only with operational needs, houses or buildings where there were — they shoot at Israeli soldiers, or there were explosives. Hamas planted explosives in these houses.” But what we are seeing is so clear. And again, Netanyahu, Prime Minister Netanyahu himself, said that “We are destroying house by house so they will have nowhere to come back to.” Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, said just yesterday that “We are not leaving even one stone standing.” So, it's very clear that the IDF reaction is not based on reality.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And did you discover any moral qualms among some of the Israeli soldiers that you interviewed about this practice?

MERON RAPOPORT: Yes, of course. The soldiers that talked with us didn't feel — didn't feel good or felt very bad with what they were doing. This is the reason they talked to us. We talked about it with about 10 soldiers.

But they also said that this is such a routine now for Israeli soldiers that they don't really — that most of the soldiers do not pay much attention, because this is the routine. This is what they do. There's very little real fighting. And one soldier who spent three months in the Netzarim Corridor said that he had very, very little real fighting in all these three months. And the routine work was to, if there were enough explosives, because sometimes there were not enough explosives, but if there were enough explosives, they would go in the morning, choose between five, 10 houses to demolish, and this is the routine work. So, the soldiers really were very used to it. And, of course, there were these soldiers that were politically motivated, right-wing soldiers, that really rejoiced in the fact that these Palestinian will have nowhere to return to. But this is not the main, I would say, atmosphere. The atmosphere is: “This is the work we are doing, and we just do it. That's what we are sent for.”

AMY GOODMAN: Meron Rapoport, I wanted to ask you about Microsoft's support for Israel. The Associated Press reports that Microsoft has now acknowledged “it sold advanced artificial intelligence and cloud computing services to the Israeli military during the war in Gaza and aided in efforts to locate and rescue Israeli hostages,” unquote. Microsoft confirmed this in an unsigned blog post. On Monday, a Microsoft worker who's a member of the No Azure for Apartheid disrupted Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's keynote address at the company's flagship Build event in Seattle, Washington.

NO AZURE FOR APARTHEID MEMBER: Satya, how about you show how Microsoft is killing Palestinians? How about you show how Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure? As a Microsoft worker, I refuse to be complicit in this genocide!

AMY GOODMAN: I wanted, Meron, to get your response to these developments and what we know about Microsoft's role, as you've edited reports by +972 on Microsoft, including one in January headlined “Leaked documents expose deep ties between Israeli army and Microsoft,” in a piece that was written by Yuval Abraham, who won the Oscar for being a co-director of the film No Other Land, Meron.

MERON RAPOPORT: Yes, it seems that this is — of course, there was this report by Yuval, and then there was a previous report quoting mainly Israeli sources, open sources, the head of a unit that is responsible for computing in the Israeli army, that she said that they received essential help to the Israeli war machine from these big three cloud companies, Azure and other — so, this is — and we had these documents that we revealed, that Yuval revealed later on. So, the relationship is certainly very close, and it does seem that this creates problems for Microsoft internally, and maybe externally and internally. We have to see. We have maybe other reports coming. I think this story is not over.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Meron Rapoport, you have — the United Nations reported in March that from March 2025 since the beginning of 2024, Israel has demolished 463 buildings in the West Bank as part of military activity, and it's displaced nearly 40,000 Palestinians from several cities in the West Bank. Could you talk about that? And also, you've reported that in Lebanon, Israel used similar demolition operations?

MERON RAPOPORT: It does seem that this has become really part of the Israeli war, the way, the modus operandi of Israeli army: destruction per se, not during fighting. We have seen that in Lebanon. We had reports in our investigation in which a soldier was told in advance that what he's going to do is to destroy the Shiites' villages in Lebanon, even before he came in. So, it didn't have anything — it didn't have direct relation to the fightings. And it seems that this —

AMY GOODMAN: Meron, we have 30 seconds.

MERON RAPOPORT: — way of action — it seems that this way of action is being copied and employed in the West Bank, as well.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to thank you so much for being with us, Meron Rapoport, editor and writer at the independent Israeli news site Local Call and a columnist at +972 Magazine. We'll link to your new article, “'Render it unusable': Israel's mission of total urban destruction.” Meron was speaking to us from Tel Aviv.

In what could be a game changer for the Trump administration's deportation efforts, the U.S. Attorney's Office for California's Central District and federal partners launched a program to “neutralize California's sanctuary state policy.”

One of President Donald Trump's main campaign promises for a second term was the mass deportation of millions who came into the country illegally during the Biden administration.

If a person who has been deported reenters the country illegally, that's a felony under Title 8 law, said Ciaran McEvoy, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles.

“Even if they want to turn them over, they can't,” McEvoy told The Epoch Times.

Operation Guardian Angel gets around the law through federal arrest warrants, which McEvoy said leave the counties no choice but to hand the targeted illegal immigrants over.

Essayli stated in the press release that “the worst criminal aliens in state custody are frequently released into the community” because California's sanctuary state policies block cooperation with federal law enforcement.

“These laws effectively render federal immigration detainers meaningless. The days of giving criminal illegal aliens a free pass are over,” he stated. “While California may be presently disregarding detainers, it cannot ignore federal arrest warrants.”

The program, which began May 10, has resulted in the arrest of 13 defendants as of May 15 in California. The Operation Guardian Angel task force is made up of ICE, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

The California federal district is home to the counties of Riverside, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles County. An estimated 1.5 million illegal immigrants reside in the district, including gang members, the press release said, adding that California's protection of criminal illegal aliens makes residents less safe.

The release noted that in February 2025, José Cristian Saravia-Sánchez, 30, of Mexico, shot and killed an Inglewood man who tried to stop him from stealing a catalytic converter, which garnered national attention.

He was an illegal immigrant who had been convicted of vehicle theft, removed from the United States in 2013, and arrested 11 times between June 2022 and August 2024, according to the release. However, local law enforcement was prevented by state law from complying with an immigration detainer request, the release stated.

The office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Epoch Times by publication time.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide, according to FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino.

The FBI chiefs confirmed Epstein's cause of death during a joint interview with Fox News on Sunday.

Patel said that he was confident that Epstein killed himself, while also acknowledging that others may believe something suspicious actually happened to him at the New York detention facility in 2019.

“They have their right to their opinion but as someone who has worked as a public defender, as a prosecutor who's been in that prison system, who's been in the Metropolitan Detention Center, who's been in segregated housing, you know a suicide when you see one, and that's what that was,” Patel told Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo.

Bongino agreed with Patel's statement that Epstein died by suicide.

“He killed himself … I have seen the whole file,” Bongino added during the interview. “He killed himself.”

In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of soliciting a prostitute and procuring a minor for prostitution, which was part of a plea deal. He was initially sentenced to 18 months in jail but served just 13 months in prison, leaving the jail almost every day as part of a work release deal.

Epstein was found dead in his cell on Aug. 10, 2019, as he awaited trial on federal charges that he allegedly orchestrated a sex trafficking ring with his longtime partner and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.

Epstein, who owned a large private island in the Caribbean and a private jet, was known to be well-connected and socialized with many powerful and wealthy public figures.

The OIG ultimately concluded that staff provided Epstein the opportunity to kill himself by failing to assign him a cellmate the day before his death, allowing him to have more linens than were normal, and not monitoring him for long periods of time.

Under Trump's tenure, Attorney General Pam Bondi has long pledged to release the so-called “Epstein files,” including a flight log and possible client list.

In February, Bondi declassified and publicly released the initial trove of files related to Epstein and his sexual exploitation of more than 250 underage girls at his homes in New York, Florida, and other locations. It included a contact book and masseuse list, both of which were heavily redacted. The first phase of those files contained documents that were previously leaked but never formally released by the federal government.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) has been charged by the Department of Justice (DOJ) with assaulting law enforcement during a scuffle that occurred outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in New Jersey, U.S. Attorney Alina Habba said on May 19.

Habba said that McIver's conduct “cannot be overlooked” by the chief federal law enforcement authority in New Jersey, adding that the charges were filed after efforts to address the matter were unsuccessful.

“I have persistently made efforts to address these issues without bringing criminal charges and have given Representative McIver every opportunity to come to a resolution, but she has unfortunately declined,” the U.S. attorney stated. “No one is above the law—politicians or otherwise.”

McIver alleged that it was ICE agents who created “an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation” during the arrest of the mayor.

“The charges against me are purely political—they mischaracterize and distort my actions, and are meant to criminalize and deter legislative oversight,” she stated. “This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right.”

“As to Delaney Hall, I will continue to advocate for the humane treatment of detainees, and I will continue to press the facility to ensure that it is compliant with City of Newark codes and regulations,” he stated. “I want to be clear: I stand with LaMonica, and I fully expect her to be vindicated.”

The Trump administration opened Delaney Hall as a detention facility for illegal immigrants on May 1 as part of its broader crackdown on illegal immigration nationwide. The move has triggered protests by illegal immigrant advocates and some Democratic politicians in recent weeks, including Baraka, a gubernatorial candidate.

Delaney Hall is a 1,000-bed facility along an industrial stretch of Newark Bay, according to the private prison company that operates the center. Baraka has said that the facility lacks the proper city permits in order to open, including a certificate of occupancy.

“This is an issue of human rights, an issue of due process, an issue of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States,” Baraka told reporters earlier this month. “We are afraid and opposed and alarmed by them setting up a detention center.”

GEO Group, which runs Delaney Hall, has accused the mayor of politicizing the situation and said that city officials didn't object when the Obama administration operated the facility as an ICE processing center.

The Epoch Times has reached out to GEO Group for further comment and did not receive a response by publication time.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Statehood is a precious commodity. After a burst of creation following the Soviet Union's collapse, only three new countries have been recognized in the last 30 years—East Timor, in 2002, Montenegro, in 2006, and South Sudan, in 2011. There have been plenty of other attempts in that interval. But most have been stymied by the principle of territorial integrity, which prioritizes fixed borders even in cases of state failure and makes the path to legal independence long and uncertain.

But in the last few years, this norm has grown weaker. In February 2022, Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine designed to wipe the country off the map. Initially met with shock and horror, the idea of the Russian conquest of Ukraine has since been normalized by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called for letting Moscow keep some of this land. Trump has also threatened to annex Canada, as well as Greenland, which is an autonomous region of Denmark. Just how serious he is remains to be seen. But the upshot is clear: the United States, the most powerful country in the world, no longer views territorial integrity as an important element of the global order.

For some secessionist groups, this is certainly good news. Independence movements no longer must prove that their cause is just or essential. Instead, they may simply need to align with powerful countries, especially in strategically important areas. Trump's preference for personal diplomacy could also help separatists, provided that they have charismatic leaders who can sidestep cumbersome institutional diplomacy and court the American president himself.

Yet Trump's rejection of international norms is a double-edged sword. These norms constrain separatists and deter governmental repression. They also give secessionists a way to make their claims. Independence movements typically justify their existence using the language of human rights and self-determination, which Trump disregards. Rather, this U.S. president favors strong, brutal rulers over fledgling upstarts. He has aligned himself with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who have used killings and other kinds of violence to suppress Kurdish and Chechen secessionists, respectively. Trump does not care about impoverished separatists if they cannot provide him with immediate rewards.

For independence movements, the era of Trump is thus one of both opportunity and danger. There are both fewer restraints and fewer protections. For groups he sees as strategically useful (or favors for some other reason), the path to statehood will become more straightforward. But for those that Trump sees as strategically useless, he will either change nothing or make life more difficult. In a system in which recognition depends on leverage rather than law, more movements could try their luck at gaining independence. But without consistent norms or protections, success will remain rare and failure will become more dangerous. More breakaway regions may receive some form of recognition, but it would be weak and partial—contingent on whether their leaders can keep aiding more powerful states. And the world as a whole will experience more bloodshed, as both governments and separatists, unencumbered by global sanctions or normative restrictions, become more assertive.

Trump is hardly the first modern American president to ignore norms governing territorial integrity when they become inconvenient. But Trump is the first in decades to disregard the idea altogether. Ukrainians “may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday,” Trump said in February. He has repeatedly called the U.S.-Canadian border an “artificially drawn line.”

These remarks are bad news for the people of Ukraine and Canada, who have made it clear that they do not want to join Russia or the United States, respectively. But if Trump's realpolitik approach takes hold, secessionist entities might find it easier to gain legitimacy by aligning with the United States or other great powers. Movements in valuable locations, such as Kurdish separatists in oil-rich Iraq or the leadership of Somaliland (which is already functionally independent, and located in the geographically important Horn of Africa), might secure U.S. recognition and support if they advance Washington's aims. Separatists in Greenland who seek independence from Denmark, or in New Caledonia who seek independence from France, could garner support from the United States or another great power if they can promise trade routes, military bases, or access to their resources.

In Trump's world, secessionists may also be able to succeed—or at least gain traction—through diplomacy. Typically, separatists are disadvantaged in talks because they are cut off from the kinds of formal institutional channels through which diplomacy normally flows. But Trump routinely disregards this standard operating procedure. Instead, he prefers personal diplomacy, such as his 2018 discussions with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. That means that charismatic separatist leaders could curry favor with the U.S. president by appealing to him directly.



Trump's world, however, will hardly guarantee more success for secessionists. The president has loosened constraints on independence movements, but his preference for strongmen and centralized control creates new obstacles. Trump tends to favor aggressive national leaders who project power, not upstart rebels or subnational challengers. This makes him more likely to support existing regimes over separatist fragments—as long as the regime supports him. During Trump's first term, for example, Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Biafra separatist movement in Nigeria, issued a personal plea to the U.S. president, citing Trump's support for Brexit as proof of his belief in self-determination. Yet there is no evidence that Trump responded, either publicly or privately, to Kanu's appeals. The U.S. government treated Biafra, which is of little strategic value to the United States, as an internal Nigerian matter, as it had for decades.

Biafra is hardly alone. Despite rhetorical nods to sovereignty, the Trump administration has showed little interest in backing most independence movements, like those of the Kurds, throughout the Middle East, or the Catalans, in Spain. In October 2019, Trump even ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria, effectively abandoning the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and allowing Turkey to launch a military operation against them. The move drew bipartisan criticism as a destabilizing betrayal of a reliable partner, and Trump ultimately agreed to keep U.S. troops in Syria (where they remain). But it still showed Trump's willingness to prioritize regional power politics over friendly secessionists.

More generally, Trump's geopolitical vision favors stable spheres of influence, where great powers set the rules. A world of breakaway regions undermines the principle of control that undergirds this Mafia-style view of order. So do the standard pro-secession arguments, which are couched in the language of human rights, minority rights, historic injustice, and self-determination. Trump, in other words, may tolerate secession if it serves a purpose. But he is unlikely to encourage it as a principle.

Because Trump's order has mixed consequences for separatists, it will not yield a single outcome for their movements. Instead, it will reconfigure the terrain on which they operate. Secession will become a geopolitical transaction, not a legal or moral claim.

This change, however, will have some predictable results. The few successful secessionist movements of the last three decades were largely the result of ethical claims, as well as intensive organization. But now separatist success will largely depend on whether the movement serves the interests of a dominant power, not on its legitimacy or efficacy. Secessionism, in turn, could cease to function as a tool of imperial resistance and instead become a tool of empire itself—a means for great powers to project influence or engage in proxy conflict (as Russia has already done by propping up breakaway regions in Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine).

As independence movements sense new openings in a weakened international order, there may still be an uptick in separatist attempts. But that hardly means that there will be more successes. Recognition will remain rare, both because great-power interests often conflict and because home states—less constrained by norms or economic restrictions—will be empowered to crush separatist uprisings before they gain ground. Instead of new full-blown states, partial recognition cases, such as Kosovo, Northern Cyprus, Palestine, and Western Sahara, might become more common. Such recognition, for example, could soon extend to Catalonia, Iraqi Kurdistan, Somaliland, and breakaway parts of Libya and Syria. For places that are already functionally independent, a transactional global order might open new diplomatic venues or economic channels that bring them closer to official recognition—provided, of course, that they can offer strategic value such as basing rights or resource access. For regions that lack de facto independence, success will now hinge even less on legal or moral claims.

In this newly contingent and chaotic world, separatist-related violence will also become more frequent. In part, that will simply be the product of renewed separatist attempts. But breakaway regions could also launch more violent attacks, encouraged by their newfound patrons and the diminished consequences of breaking international law. Incumbents, likewise, will feel more empowered to use violence to quash independence movements. The global institutions that traditionally restrain both secessionist overreach and heavy-handed repression are losing their power to constrain either. The EU once played a central role in restraining violence between Serbia and Kosovo, for example, using accession talks as leverage to encourage cooperation. The UN helped limit violence in East Timor and South Sudan by providing peacekeeping forces. But ultimately, these institutions derive their power from the support of member countries, which is weakening. Trump, for his part, has repeatedly attacked both bodies and cut U.S. funding for the UN's peacekeeping missions.

For independence movements, the new rules of secession mean a more volatile and uncertain future. If success depends on timing, charisma, and strategic utility, some breakaway regions may have a shortcut to recognition. Others might suffer. All of them, however, will have to navigate a landscape where sovereignty is not earned but cynically auctioned off.

As tensions rise across the Taiwan Strait, the policy debate in Washington remains fractured. U.S. strategy broadly revolves around deterring China from attacking Taiwan, and for the past three presidential administrations, it has consisted of three central components: increasing the ability of the United States and Taiwan to defend the island militarily; using diplomacy to signal U.S. resolve to protect Taiwan while also reassuring China that Washington does not support Taiwanese independence; and using economic pressure to slow China's military modernization efforts.

But there is little consensus on the right balance among these three components—and that balance determines to some degree how deterrence looks in practice. Some contend that diplomatic pressure—along with military restraint, to avoid antagonizing China—will keep Beijing at bay. Others warn that unless Washington significantly strengthens its military posture in Asia, deterrence will collapse. And a third approach, outlined recently in Foreign Affairs by Jennifer Kavanagh and Stephen Wertheim, emphasizes that bolstering Taiwan's self-defense and enabling offshore U.S. support is the best route to sustaining deterrence while also mitigating the risk of escalation.These prescriptions have merit but fall short of grappling with the paradox at the heart of U.S. strategy: deterrence can fail in two ways. Do too little, and Beijing may gamble it can seize Taiwan before Washington is able to respond. Do too much, and Chinese leaders may conclude that force is the only remaining path to unification. Navigating this dilemma requires more than a stronger military or bolder diplomacy. It requires a calibrated strategy of rearmament, reassurance, and restraint that threads the needle between weakness and recklessness. Combined properly, forward-deployed capabilities, diplomatic restraint, and selective economic interdependence can reinforce one another to maintain credible deterrence while avoiding provocation.

So far, however, the Trump administration's approach to Taiwan has veered between harsh transactionalism, such as the imposition of a 32 percent tariff on most Taiwanese goods last month, and quiet reaffirmations of support for Taipei through bipartisan visits and a pause on the highest tariffs. The administration still has time to settle on a coherent strategy, but the window of opportunity is closing.

Currently, the U.S. military is improving its force posture in the vicinity of Taiwan, most notably through expanded access to bases in the Philippines and by reinforcing capabilities in southwestern Japan and the broader western Pacific. In the Philippines, thanks to the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, the United States gained access to four new strategic sites, bringing the total there to nine. Several, such as those in Cagayan and Isabela Provinces, are just a few hundred miles from Taiwan.

The story is similar in Japan's case. Washington and Tokyo agreed in 2023 to restructure the U.S. Marine Corps presence in Okinawa from the artillery-focused 12th Marine Regiment, part of a force of roughly 18,000 marines stationed in Japan, into a 2,000-strong Marine Littoral Regiment, a quick-reaction force designed to operate along the so-called first island chain encompassing Indonesia, Japan, portions of the Philippines, and Taiwan. To complement this effort, the U.S. military has increased joint military exercises and expanded integrated air and missile defense systems across allied territories.

But U.S. military capabilities in the Pacific need more than just quantitative upgrades; they require qualitative shifts to be able to block China from forcibly unifying with Taiwan. The United States needs a greater forward presence in the region, as well as specific capabilities that would prevent an invading force from making its way across the Taiwan Strait, such as strategic bombers, submarines, and antiship missiles. Once those were deployed, they would also require significant operational flexibility. For example, Washington should prioritize securing forward-deployed submarine tenders in Japan and the Philippines to enable submarines to reload, resupply, and rearm without returning to Guam or Hawaii. And it should work to establish permanent bomber bases in Australia and the Philippines and deploy antiship missile systems in Japan's southwestern islands and the northern Philippines.



So far, the U.S. military has stopped short of seeking such changes because they are politically sensitive both at home and abroad: host countries worry they might become greater targets of Chinese aggression, and some U.S. policymakers worry that such moves could cross a redline for Beijing. But if Washington follows a few principles, such improvements will not necessarily provoke Chinese aggression. First, the United States should not make a public announcement or a spectacle of enhancements to its military force posture. As U.S. forces increase their activities around and in Taiwan, be they joint exercises, freedom of navigation exercises, or training, U.S. officials should refrain from making statements to which China might feel forced to respond. Military upgrades should be concealed or downplayed until they are fielded to minimize the likelihood that China will effectively launch a coercive campaign against their deployment.

Bolstering Taiwan's independent military capabilities—a long-standing U.S. policy—presents an arguably even bigger risk of provocation. Beijing worries that Taiwan will become so certain of its ability to protect itself that it will consider declaring independence. In recent years, Taiwan has acquired defense capabilities with the aim of deterring potential Chinese aggression. It has bought asymmetric warfare systems, such as coastal defense cruise missiles and HIMARS rocket systems, moving away from traditional high-cost platforms such as submarines. It has also pledged that its defense budget will exceed three percent of GDP in 2025 and that it will prioritize precision-guided munitions, air defense upgrades, command-and-control systems, equipment for reserve forces, and anti-drone technologies. These are sensible steps, but they also pose a risk: the less Taiwan depends on U.S. assistance, the more China's leaders worry that Taiwan's president, Lai Ching-te, could be emboldened to declare independence unilaterally—further incentivizing Beijing to invade sooner rather than later.

To prevent deterrence from morphing into provocation, the United States should provide Taiwan mainly with capabilities that rely on continued U.S. support. In 2024, for example, the Biden administration approved the sale of three National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems to Taiwan in a deal that was brokered to increase U.S.-Taiwanese interoperability. In other words, this system was designed to function best in tandem with U.S. support. The United States should continue to encourage Taiwan's asymmetric defense, particularly by prioritizing the speedy and reliable delivery of systems such as the highly mobile precision HIMARS rockets; advanced air defense missile systems such as the NASAMS; and antiship missiles such as the RGM-84L-4 Block II Harpoon. But Washington should also highlight the aspects of Taiwan's military capacity that are linked to the United States, reassuring Beijing that the island cannot act alone.

Reassuring Beijing is a critical component of a successful deterrence strategy. But during both the Trump and the Biden administrations, the United States has relaxed its longstanding policy of “strategic ambiguity,” wherein U.S. policy has avoided defining whether and under what circumstances Washington would intervene to defend Taiwan. Instead, the United States has been signaling to China its determination to defend Taiwan—especially by making incremental moves toward establishing formal diplomatic relations with the island, such as direct interactions between American and Taiwanese officials.

Joe Biden was the first U.S. president to invite Taiwan's diplomatic representatives to attend his inauguration, for example, and he repeatedly referred to a U.S. “commitment” to Taiwan's defense, even saying once that U.S. forces would defend the island in the event of an “unprecedented attack.” (White House officials stated at the time that there was no change to the official policy of “strategic ambiguity.”) Officials in the second Trump administration, including Mike Waltz before he was ousted as national security adviser, have advocated ending strategic ambiguity and moving toward “strategic clarity.” And in February, the State Department removed a statement about not supporting Taiwan's independence from its website—a deletion that China interpreted as provocative.

Although they may seem merely symbolic, such diplomatic slights have real consequences, making it harder for Beijing to maintain a veneer of progress toward unification of the mainland with Taiwan. Chinese leaders see any drift toward Taiwanese independence as a threat to their legitimacy. So, far from deterring Beijing, U.S. provocations—official diplomatic interactions, references to Taiwan as a country, calls for a U.S.-Taiwanese alliance—could incentivize Beijing to undertake a cross-strait invasion.

Reassurance that Washington does not support Taiwanese independence should include public criticism when Taiwan's leaders make statements or take actions that suggest otherwise. For example, in December 2003, President George W. Bush publicly rebuked Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian during a joint press conference with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, stating that the United States opposed any “unilateral decision by either China or Taiwan to change the status quo,” noting that Chen's “comments and actions” had indicated “that he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally to change” it. In 2006, after Chen angered Beijing by scrapping a government council that had been established to guide unification with China, the Bush administration once again signaled its disapproval, denying the Taiwanese leader's request for a high-profile U.S. stopover during a presidential trip to Latin America. These sorts of reassurances helped convince Chinese leaders that future “peaceful reunification” remained possible, reducing the likelihood of an invasion.

The United States should also keep trying to build a multilateral consensus for peace in the Taiwan Strait. For instance, joint statements issued at the G-7 summit last month and at the Munich Security Conference in February reaffirmed cross-strait stability and expressed opposition to any unilateral actions that threaten peace in the Taiwan Strait, including through force or coercion. Washington should pair these diplomatic signals with a clear reaffirmation that its “one China” policy remains in place, that any resolution must be nonviolent, and that the United States is not against peaceful unification with Taiwan's assent.

These changes to military capabilities and to U.S. diplomacy are easy compared with what is required in the third area of U.S. deterrence strategy: economic pressure. Economic pressure can undermine deterrence and reassurance alike. Since the first Trump administration, the United States has pursued an economic containment strategy to slow China's long-term growth and deny it advanced technologies, with the aim of hampering its capacity to match U.S. military investments. This began with the first Trump administration's tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of Chinese goods. The Biden administration not only kept these tariffs in place but also added export controls on strategically important technologies, such as semiconductors and telecommunications. The United States also pressured American companies to shift their supply chains and manufacturing operations away from China.

The second Trump administration has threatened to accelerate an economic decoupling from China with even wider-ranging, unconditional tariffs, although the prospect of financial pain for the United States seems to have given it pause for now. Nonetheless, these policies portend lasting damage to the Chinese economy, especially in view of China's looming demographic and environmental challenges. For Washington, the hope remains that Beijing may be unable to keep pace militarily as its relative growth rate slows.

But the ongoing U.S.-Chinese trade war and escalating American export and investment restrictions have deepened Beijing's mistrust and reinforced its claim that Washington seeks containment rather than peaceful coexistence. This economic pressure not only risks hardening China's resolve but also enables Beijing to recast itself as a defender of global trade norms and to shift blame for any global economic slowdown to the United States. At the same time, the United States risks forfeiting its long-term leverage, as the tariffs may goad Beijing to deepen its commitment to what the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) calls “domestic demand expansion,” or selling more products at home instead of exporting them. Such a shift in China's economy would encourage domestic production and innovation and accelerate efforts to reduce reliance on foreign markets.

This U.S. strategy will also have limited effects on China's long-term military prowess. China has pursued military modernization at historically low costs, avoiding the classic “guns or butter” dilemma. China has not matched U.S. defense spending dollar for dollar, as challengers did in earlier great-power rivalries. Nazi Germany, for instance, spent twice as much on its military as the United Kingdom did between 1933 and 1939. And during the Cold War, the U.S. and Soviet defense budgets signaled direct competition: the United States spent an average of 32 percent more than the Soviet Union until 1970, when the Soviet Union took the lead, outspending the U.S. by an average of 26 percent until 1988. In contrast, China has made targeted investments intended to give it an advantage in a quick, limited war, while keeping its overall defense spending relatively modest: Beijing's defense spending has risen from five percent of U.S. levels in 1995 to 32 percent in 2017. In this way, China has sustained both economic development and military modernization, but avoided a Cold War­–style arms race. China will therefore be able to continue its military modernization program even with a stagnant economy, especially if it increases its military spending as a share of GDP.



Indeed, instead of hampering China's military, the trade war could make a shooting war seem more appealing to Beijing. Currently Chinese leaders would consider an invasion of Taiwan only in a specific, narrow scenario: if China could take the island before U.S. forces could intervene. For Beijing, a larger-scale, protracted war would be too costly. This is partly because of the economic value of the U.S.-Chinese relationship. But if U.S. economic pressure increases, Chinese leaders could conclude that the benefits of continued economic engagement are low and that conflict with the United States is the only way to get out from under the American thumb. This would make them more willing to risk war over Taiwan.

Concrete economic and diplomatic concessions that increase China's benefits from maintaining the status quo and credibly convey benign U.S. intent would be effective reassurances. Pausing or reversing the economic decoupling is an obvious place to start; Washington should rescind tariffs on Chinese imports (or at least make them conditional on reasonable Chinese reciprocation) and relax its restrictions on exports and on incoming investment in all but the most sensitive technologies and sectors. This would not only quell Beijing's perception that the United States seeks to weaken and “split” China but also allay any brewing domestic instability that could threaten the CCP's legitimacy and encourage Chinese leaders to forcibly take Taiwan to boost nationalist legitimacy. Perhaps most important, sustaining economic interdependence, especially the asymmetric sort that currently exists, gives the United States enormous leverage over China by allowing it to threaten heavier sanctions in the event of war. Unilateral U.S. sanctions could set the Chinese economy on a path of permanent decline. Pausing or circumscribing an economic decoupling would give U.S. sanctions maximum bite and bolster deterrence.

Of course, bolstering economic interdependence also requires limiting U.S. reliance on key Chinese imports, such as rare-earth minerals, transformers for the electric grid, scarce medicines, high-tech electronics, and other industrial, infrastructural, and military inputs. The United States should diversify its sources for these imports and reduce the proportion that China provides to acceptable levels. But Washington does not need to immediately reduce imports of Chinese consumer goods, even though substitutes can be found relatively easily. Allowing such imports to continue would enable the United States to avoid destabilizing China while retaining the threat of painful sanctions. Finally, to maximize its deterrent leverage against China, Washington should coordinate a sanctions coalition with allies, which may require offering them subsidies or other concessions.

For many in Washington, deterrence has come to mean projecting an uncompromising and even hostile posture toward China. But such gestures do not meaningfully augment Taiwan's security. Instead, the United States should invest quietly in its military readiness and capabilities, speak carefully, and maintain economic resilience and even some interdependence. The dilemma of deterrence—the fact that it can so easily slide into provocation or procrastination—necessitates such a tightrope approach. And if there's one place where striking the right balance could pay enormous dividends, it's Taiwan.

            Increasing the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction could benefit millions of tax filers.
    


            But a proposal to do just that has become a point of contention and a possible roadblock to House Republicans' passing “one big, beautiful bill” that reflects President Donald Trump's agenda. That agenda includes making permanent essentially all of the individual income tax provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which are otherwise scheduled to expire this year.
    


            The SALT deduction, as it is known, enables federal income tax filers to deduct either their state and local income taxes or their state and local general sales taxes. In addition, they are also allowed to deduct their property taxes, assuming their income or sales taxes don't put them over the cap. The tax break, however, may only be taken by those who itemize deductions on their federal returns, which only a minority of filers do.

Trump to personally appeal to lawmakers as major sticking points remain unresolved on his ‘one big, beautiful' agenda bill



            Prior to 2017, there was no limit on the SALT deduction.
    


            But the TCJA imposed a $10,000 cap — which, when coupled with the expanded standard deduction under that tax law, meant the number of people who claimed the SALT deduction fell dramatically — from about one-quarter of filers in 2017, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, to less than 10% today.
    


            Going forward, it appears there will still be a cap, but it likely will be higher than $10,000. The question is just how much higher and for whom?
    


            The House Ways and Means and House Budget committees already approved a tax package that would permanently raise the cap to $30,000 for any taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income is $400,000 or less if married filing jointly (and $200,000 or less for single filers). But anyone above those income thresholds would still be able to deduct at least $10,000, according to the Tax Foundation.
    


            The expectation, however, is that the cap will have to be higher than $30,000 to garner needed votes by a small group of House Republicans.
    


            Republicans introduced the cap as part of their 2017 tax cuts bill to help pay for the sweeping legislation. And they are hoping to use it again as a revenue raiser in this year's package.
    


            For example, the $30,000 cap proposal, which is expected to ﻿be amended before the House bill goes to the floor for a vote as early as Thursday, is estimated to raise $915.6 billion over 10 years relative to simply letting the cap expire as it is otherwise set to do if lawmakers don't act, according to estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation.

Here's what's in the House GOP's sweeping tax and spending cuts package



            But GOP lawmakers from high-tax blue states, such as California and New York, are demanding greater relief for their constituents, who are disproportionately affected by the lower cap.
    


            This has sparked intraparty battles with their colleagues from lower-tax red states, whose residents don't benefit from the deduction nearly as much.
    


            It's hardly the first time SALT has been the subject of dispute in modern times, said tax historian Joe Thorndike.
    


            The SALT break has been on the books since 1913, when the federal income tax code was created. It also had a decade-long stint during the Civil War as well.
    


            But there have been efforts to limit the deduction over the past five decades. While originally the SALT deduction was created so that the federal government didn't encroach upon states' ability to collect revenue, SALT today is portrayed as a subsidy to high-tax states and as regressive in that it disproportionately benefits higher-income households, Thorndike noted.
    


            In 2020, the SALT deduction was claimed on just 8.6% of all federal tax returns, according to the Tax Policy Center.
    


            But the incidence of people claiming it was most concentrated in 13 states and the District of Columbia.
    


            The deduction was claimed on more than 20% of returns from Maryland and Washington, DC; and on 10% to 20% of returns filed by residents of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Utah, Virginia and Washington State.
    


            And those who have received the biggest break — both before and after the cap was imposed — are high-income filers, especially those in high-tax states and cities.
    


            In 2017, before the cap went into effect, for example, roughly two-thirds of the benefit went to those with incomes of $200,000 or more, according to the center. The average SALT deduction was about $13,000, but it topped $30,000 in eight counties, mostly in California and New York.
    


            While the vast majority of middle- and upper-income households received tax relief from TCJA regardless of where they lived, they would have received even more, had the cap not been instituted, said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the TPC.
    


            For example, the tax cut for those in the top 20% would have been $2,500 larger, on average, had their state and local tax deductions not been limited, according to the center. Their average individual income tax cut was only about $6,200, instead of $8,700.
    


            The cap had an even greater impact on taxpayers in the top 1%, whose average tax cut was $40,100, instead of $71,000.
    


            But those in the bottom 80% would not have seen much of a change in the size of their tax cut had the cap not been put in place.

            • On the stand: Sharay Hayes, a former male exotic dancer, is testifying in the federal sex-trafficking trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs.
    


            • Earlier testimony: Earlier today, Cassie Ventura's mother, Regina Ventura, testified about threats she said Combs made against her and her daughter. Over four days last week, Cassie Ventura — who dated Combs and is one of his accusers — testified that she endured physical and sexual abuse from him and detailed how Combs orchestrated drug-fueled sex performances called “Freak Offs.”
    


            • Federal charges: Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison.
    


            • Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline.



            Sharay Hayes, a male escort who said he was hired by Sean “Diddy” Combs and Cassie Ventura, is back on the stand and testifying about his interactions with Ventura and Combs
    


            He said sometimes he'd meet them on consecutive days — but those instances would be months apart.
    


            Hayes said he always met them at a hotel in New York City. Sometimes he'd meet them at 2:30 a.m. ET and wouldn't leave until after 11 a.m. ET.
    


            Hayes said he usually received a message from Ventura planning a few hours in advance.
    


            The judge is back on the bench, although the jury hasn't been brought back in yet.
    


            When the jury comes back, Sharay Hayes, a former male exotic dancer, will continue testifying.
    


            The jury is in day seven of Sean “Diddy” Combs' federal racketeering and sex-trafficking trial. Here's a recap of what witnesses said on the stand:
    


David James, former assistant to Combs:



Regina Ventura, Cassie Ventura's mother:



Sharay Hayes, male escort



            The jury has been dismissed for lunch until 1 p.m. ET.
    


            Male escort Sharay Hayes will continue testifying after the break.
    


            Sharay Hayes, testifying about his first interaction with Cassie Ventura and Sean “Diddy Combs” at Trump International Hotel in New York City, said he didn't know the man in the room was Combs.
    


            On another occasion when he joined Combs and Ventura at a hotel, Hayes testified, the TV displayed a message: “The Essex House would like to welcome Mr. Sean Combs.” Hayes said he was a fan of Combs and already followed him on social media at the time.
    


            After he saw the TV message, Hayes recognized Ventura from photos of the couple together, he said.
    


            Hayes joined the couple for similar interactions about eight to 12 times in total, he testified.
    


            Testifying more about the first encounter he had with Sean “Diddy” Combs and Cassie Ventura, Sharay Hayes said he followed Ventura's lead and “mimicked” what she did.
    


            Hayes said that when Ventura began to pour baby oil on herself, he did too. Eventually, he saw a man enter the room, he testified.
    


            Hayes recalled that Combs would speak to Ventura giving “subtle directions,” including adjustments he wanted to the lighting and to how her body was positioned.
    


            Hayes said that at the end of the encounter, Ventura thanked him and handed him an additional $1,200.
    


            Sharay Hayes continued describing his first encounter with Cassie Ventura and Sean “Diddy” Combs, at Trump International Hotel in New York City:
    


            Ventura greeted him at the door in a robe when he arrived, and he believed she was also wearing a wig, he said. He did not recognize her at the time, he tesitified.
    


            Ventura invited him into the suite, and she explained that she didn't want him to actually dance. She told him “her and (her) husband liked to create a sexy scene” involving the application of baby oil, and  that her husband eventually would come out to watch, Hayes testified.
    


            Ventura told him to ignore her husband, Hayes said. “I was specifically told to not acknowledge her husband, try not to look at him, no communication or anything,” he testified.
    


            After explaining the situation, Ventura handed him “a stack of cash” and said he could change into underwear or a towel in the bathroom. He counted $800 in cash then slipped into a towel, he said.
    


            Sharay Hayes testified that he met Sean “Diddy” Combs and Cassie Ventura sometime in the fall of 2012.
    


            He said he first got a call from Ventura, who told him her name was Janet. She said it was her birthday and her husband said she could hire an exotic dancer for the occassion.
    


            He said he believes they found him through his website.
    


            Hayes said he met Combs and Ventura at Trump International Hotel in New York City that first time. He said he believed he was going there to provide a 30- or 45-minute strip tease dance for a small group.
    


            Sharay Hayes is now on the stand.
    


            Hayes, now 51, said he worked as a male exotic dancer with the stage name “The Punisher” from 2012 to 2016.
    


            Regina Ventura, Cassie Ventura's mother, is now off the witness stand.
    


            Defense attorneys did not cross-examine her. “I don't have any questions for you,” defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said after greeting her.
    


            Regina Ventura, Cassie Ventura's mother, said she visited Cassie and Combs in LA in August 2016 for her daughter's 30th birthday. She and Combs got into a “bitter argument” outside of Cassie's apartment building after Combs “stole” Cassie's phone. Regina Ventura said she called the police.
    


            “We were arguing about the phone, I wanted the phone back and he was holding it,” she said. One of Combs' security guards was standing between them, she said. “I was yelling, screaming, and trying to hit him,” she said, but said that she was not able to hit him.
    


            Regina Ventura said Combs eventually gave her the phone, but then he took Cassie's car.
    


            The jury is now seeing photos of Cassie Ventura that her mother took in December 2011 in her parents' Connecticut home after Sean “Diddy” Combs physically allegedly assaulted her.
    


            Regina Ventura testified that she took the photos to keep the evidence
    


                    “She was bruised, and I wanted to make sure that we memorialized it,” Regina Ventura said.
                





            Regina Ventura said her daughter told her at the time “that she was beaten by Sean Combs.”
    


            These photos were first admitted into evidence during Cassie Ventura's testimony
    


            Regina Ventura said December 2011 was the first time her daughter told her about Combs being physical with her.
    


            Regina Ventura testified about a time prior to that when she read a “blind item” about a celebrity getting beat up in a car with no names included. She said she asked her daughter if it was about her, but Cassie Ventura told her it wasn't about her or Combs, Regina Ventura said.
    


            Regina Ventura, the mother of Cassie Ventura, said Sean “Diddy” Combs contacted her around the same time Cassie Ventura told her Combs threatened to release sexually explicit videos of her.
    


            Regina Ventura said Combs told her he needed $20,000 to “recoup money” he had spent on Cassie Ventura. Regina Ventura said Combs was angry her daughter was now in a relationship with Kid Cudi.
    


            Regina Ventura said she and her husband took a home equity loan to obtain the $20,000 for Combs.
    


                    “That's the only way we could get the money,” she testified.
                





            Combs' bookkeeper sent Regina Ventura an email with wiring instructions she said, so she went to the credit union and then wired the money from her and her husband's account to the Bad Boy account.
    


            Regina Ventura said did it because she was “scared about my daughter's safety.”
    


            She said about four or five days later, the money was returned to her account, but she did not have any communications with Combs about it.
    


            Regina Ventura, Cassie Ventura's mother, testified that her daughter emailed her in December 2011 to say Sean “Diddy” Combs was threatening to release explicit sex tapes of Cassie.
    


            This appears to mesh with Cassie Ventura's earlier testimony that Combs threatened Cassie in December 2011 when he learned she was dating Scott Mescudi, also known as rapper Kid Cudi.
    


            The email said, according to Regina Ventura: “The threats that have been made towards me by Sean ‘Puffy' Combs are that are that he is going to release 2 explicit sex tapes of me. One on Christmas Day, maybe before or right after and another one some time soon after that. He has also said that he will be having someone hurt me and Scott Mescudi physically (he made a point that it wouldn't be by his hands, he actually said he'd be out of the country when it happened).”
    


            Regina Ventura said she felt “physically sick” when she read the email. The message was sent under an alias “Veronica Bang,” the mother said.
    


            The email also was sent to one of Combs' employees, Regina Ventura said.
    


            “I did not understand a lot of it. The sex tapes threw me. I did not know the other person, but knew that he was going to try to hurt my daughter,” Regina Ventura said.
    


Remember: This is what Cassie Ventura said last week about the threat: “He (Combs) told me about videos that he had that he was going to release, and that he was going to hurt Scott and I,” she said, adding the videos he was referring to were of sexual performances called “Freak Offs.” Cassie Ventura also testified Combs told her Kid Cudi's car would be blown up in his driveway before it happened.



            Cassie Ventura's mother, Regina Ventura, who took the stand late this morning, may help prosecutors make the argument that her daughter was coerced and can speak to Cassie Ventura's state of mind, CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson told CNN's Kate Bolduan Tuesday.
    


            “I think they're going to get to any behavioral differences as it relates to Cassie's behavior when she got into the relationship” with Sean “Diddy” Combs “versus ongoing and ending the relationship. That speaks to whether she's coerced. It speaks to her real state of mind,” Jackson said. “Because this issue of coercion is a big battleground. … You either were a freak and you did this and you knew what you were doing, or you did it because he forced you to do it, so to speak.”
    


            Prosecutors have said Combs ran a criminal racketeering enterprise in which he and some in his inner circle coerced women into participating in drug-fueled sex performances he called “Freak Offs.”
    


            Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.
    


            Jackson also said Cassie Ventura's mother could testify if her daughter ever shared her feelings with her after the incidents, as a “recent outcry” witness.
    


            “That's admissible evidence. It's not hearsay, and it goes to the critical issue of whether she was consenting,” Jackson said.
    


            “From a defense perspective, it's a nightmare to cross examine a mother,” Jackson added.
    


            Prosecutors have also said Regina Ventura can testify that in December 2011 Combs demanded she pay him $20,000 for money he spent on her daughter after he learned she was romantically involved with Kid Cudi. Regina Ventura took out a loan and wired the money to Combs. The money was wired back to her without explanation days later, the prosecution said.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo argued she should not be allowed to say that in court as it could be prejudicial to Combs, but Judge Arun Subramanian said Agnifilo could object to the testimony when it comes up, and he'd deal with it then.
    


            Prosecutor Emily Johnson asked Regina Ventura to identify Sean “Diddy” Combs in a photo and explain how she knew him.
    


            “He dated my daughter,” Regina Ventura replied.
    


            Regina Ventura said she first met Combs in 2006 when her daughter, Cassie Ventura, signed with Combs' record label, Bad Boy Records.
    


            Regina Ventura said when her daughter and Combs started dating in New York City, she'd see her daughter about three or four times a year.
    


            When Cassie Ventura moved to California with Combs, Regina Ventura said she saw her less frequently, usually around the holidays.
    


            “It was harder to get to her,” Regina Ventura said.
    


            The jury is coming back in now and court proceedings are resuming.
    


            Prosecutors have called Regina Ventura, Cassie Ventura's mother, to the stand. Prosecutor Emily Johnson is questioning Regina Ventura for the government.
    


            David James is off the stand.
    


            The trial adjourned for a 10-minute recess.
    


            On redirect examination, David James testified that Combs once asked him to falsely report to police about an altercation between Combs and the music mogul's then-chef in Combs' house in Alpine, New Jersey.
    


            “He (Combs) instructed me to say that she (the chef) was the aggressor and hit him first,” James said.
    


            James said he didn't want to make a false report to police, so he drove around New Jersey for a while. When he eventually returned to the house, he told Combs he had made the report, James testified.
    


            This is the same chef – a woman – that James had testified that he, himself, had been in an altercation with in Florida. James testified that Combs told him, “You can't be putting your hands on women,” and warned that he'd have to fire James if it happened again.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo is done cross-examining David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs.
    


            Prosecutor Christy Slavik is back up for re-direct.
    


            On cross-examination, Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo returned to David James' testimony that he overheard Sean “Diddy” Combs tell a business associate that Cassie Ventura was “moldable” and that he had her “right where I want her, she's young.”
    


            James said this conversation occurred “very early on” in Combs' and Ventura's relationship. He said that Kim Porter, the mother of several of Combs' children, had recently moved to LA, and Combs had been spending more time there.
    


            During the cross-examination of David James, the former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs talked of a time he was in an altercation with one of Combs' chefs, and about how Combs confronted him about it.
    


            When asked by defense attorney Marc Agnifilo, James acknowledged that he got into an altercation with one of Combs' then-chefs, a woman, at Combs' Star Island home in Florida.
    


            James testified that he grew upset when the chef tried to tell him where Combs needed to be. James said he “grabbed her two wrists and squeezed her wrists and told her to stay in her … lane.”
    


            The altercation was reported to human resources at Bad Boy Entertainment, and eventually made it back to Combs who confronted James, the ex-assistant to Combs testified.
    


            When he told Combs what had happened, Combs told James, “You can't be putting your hands on women,” and warned that he'd have to fire James if it happened again, James testified.
    


            Combs told him to write the chef a note and get her a gift, James said. James did so, and she eventually forgave him, he testified.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked David James to confirm that he never told Sean “Diddy” Combs before or after he procured cocaine for Combs' friend while they were on a yacht in Saint-Tropez.
    


            Agnifilo suggested Combs wasn't involved at all in the situation and James fulfilled the request because he wanted to.
    


            James said he viewed it as a work-related task that he had to do for Combs' personal friend, but acknowledged he didn't tell his boss about it.
    


            David James testified that there was camaraderie among Sean “Diddy” Combs' staff and that they would often say Comb's record label, Bad Boy Records, was a family.
    


            “Mama Combs called me her son at one point,” James, a former assistant for Combs, said.
    


            James confirmed that he felt a sense of mission working for Combs, and defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked what that mission was.
    


            “To make sure that he was happy and prepared for the day,” James responded.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo has followed up on David James' earlier testimony that Sean “Diddy” Combs typically had a “rider” that listed preferred items that should be in a location before Combs arrived.
    


            Agnifilo confirmed with James that a rider is common for a “high-level” person traveling.
    


            James, who was an assistant to Combs from 2007 to 2009, agreed that the rider allowed for Combs to have a “consistent environment” wherever he went.
    


            Heinz ketchup, for example, was always on the list, James said.
    


            “Ketchup was a big item that he always needed for his food, so it was just the consistency, to create a consistent environment for wherever he was,” James said.
    


Earlier today: James talked of other items he'd lay out before Combs' arrival, including clothing, a toiletry bag, a medicine bag, food and drinks. He said he would organize a collection of about 40 products, mostly skincare, for Combs in hotel bathrooms. When he restocked “personal items,” such as baby oil, lubricant and condoms, James said he would ask security for reimbursement.
    


            James had testified yesterday that part of his job was to prepare hotel rooms for Combs with a list of items, and to “get every environment comfortable.”
    


            David ﻿James, a former assistant for Sean “Diddy” Combs, testfiied that when he purchased “personal items,” including condoms, baby oil, and personal lubricant, for Combs, he would ask the security for cash from Combs' bag.
    


            James said he was instructed not to submit these items for reimbursement through the company because they were “items he didn't want to have a record for.”
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked James to confirm that meant the company didn't pay for these items.
    


            “I mean, it's all his money,” James responded.
    


            David James testified that one of Sean “Diddy” Combs' assistants had to go to the hospital for dehydration after working with Combs for 24 hours straight.
    


            He said the work was demanding, but he was “prepared for the moment” and enjoyed it at times.
    


            He testified there was a common saying among Combs' security guards: “You know what rhymes with tired? Fired.”
    


            David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, is an important prosecution witness for his ability to tell jurors what it was like in the music mogul's inner circle, according to CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson.
    


            “He takes you into the enterprise,” Jackson said.
    


            “Remember about the overall charges, you're looking at RICO,” continued Jackson.
    


            The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, is used to describe 35 offenses, including kidnapping, murder, bribery, arson and extortion.
    


            Prosecutors have said Combs ran a criminal racketeering enterprise in which he and some in his inner circle coerced women into participating in drug-fueled sex performances he called “Freak Offs.”
    


            “So what prosecutors are doing is getting to this bad behavior, not just to dirty Diddy up, which they're doing effectively,” Jackson said. “But also to get you to that RICO issue: This was a bad guy running a criminal enterprise.”
    


            James, an assistant for Combs from 2007 to 2009, also said he recalled a conversation he had with Combs' ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura where she said to him, “Man, this lifestyle is crazy.” He said he agreed and suggested she leave, he testified. “I can't. I can't get out,” Ventura told him, according to James.
    


            “That means coercion…” Jackson said. “This is the government's theory that she had no real choice but to do what she was doing. That's what they're saying. The defense obviously vehemently objects to that, denies it.”
    


            Over four days last week, Ventura testified she endured physical and sexual abuse from Combs and detailed how he orchestrated the “Freak Offs.”
    


            Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.
    


            David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified that he typically rode in a second car to accompany Combs wherever he went.
    


            James said there was usually a second car traveling with Combs for security reasons.
    


            Combs' security personnel typically operated a second car to the right of the vehicle transporting Combs to prevent anyone from “pulling up on him” and potentially assassinating him, James said.
    


            When Sean “Diddy” Combs would go out in public, people would be “almost in a mob around him,” asking for autographs and trying to meet him, Combs' former assistant David James said.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked if Combs tended to be gracious in these situations.
    


            “I don't think ‘gracious' is a word I would use to describe Mr. Combs,” James responded.
    


            Combs didn't typically sign autographs, James said. James said oftentimes, Combs' staff members would sign autographs to mail out to fans.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo suggested repeatedly that David James actually left D-Roc, one of Sean “Diddy” Combs security guards, at the restaurant and he went back with Combs to get him.
    


            James denied this each time, testifying that it wouldn't have made sense to leave him there with Suge Knight outside, wielding a gun.
    


            During cross-examination, David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, was pressed about his travel with Combs. James had testified yesterday he traveled extensively with the music mogul, including internationally.
    


            Today, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked if these were business trips or personal trips. James said there was a “fine line,” since Combs' personal life and business life blended together. He described them as “business-oriented trips.”
    


            “Even on vacation, he's always working,” James said.
    


            Sean Diddy Combs' former assistant David James testified that before he began working for Combs, he was a fan of Sean John, Combs' clothing line.
    


            James said he knew Combs to be a successful, self-made business man who was a “brilliant marketer.”
    


                    “I just respect Mr. Combs from a business perspective,” James said.
                





            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked David James if he was granted immunity for his testimony.
    


            James said he wasn't sure of the details that were brokered by his attorney, but he believes he signed a proffer agreement, a type agreement that gives a person some protection from prosecution.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo referenced documents from David James' meetings with the government, highlighting one where his account of the Mel's Diner event ended before he returned to Combs' home.
    


            He said the government had instructed him not to say anything that could incriminate himself.
    


            The documents also indicate at one point he told them some of the events took place inside the diner, even though he testified today they occurred outside the diner.
    


            “I think these are inaccurate notes,” James said. He maintained that his recollection of the majority of the event has remained consistent.
    


            Agnifilo asked James whether he spoke up at any point when Combs was allegedly telling him to get back in the car to return to Mel's Diner or when Combs was sitting in the back seat with three guns.
    


            James said, “Respectfully Sir, you have someone with three guns in this close proximity, I didn't think I had the option to say something.”
    


            Agnifilo also grilled James about his conversations with prosecutors Tuesday morning before he took the stand again, asking if James was prepped on how to handle the Mel's Diner incident.
    


            James said they mentioned Agnifilo's style, garnering laughs in the courtroom.
    


            “How'd I do,” Agnifilo asked laughing.
    


            “Consistent,” James said.
    


            David James testified about an occasion when he went with Combs' security guard to a diner to get food for Combs and the staff.
    


            When they got there, the security guard saw Combs' rival Marion “Suge” Knight and approached him. They talked briefly before the guard and James went inside to order. When they went back to Combs' house, Combs and Ventura were outside the house arguing. Ventura looked like she'd been crying.
    


            Combs then ordered James to drive him and the security guard back to the diner to look for Knight, James said. Combs sat in the back seat with three hand guns in his lap, James testified.
    


            Knight was gone when they got back to the restaurant, James said.
    


            James said he was “shook up” by the incident. It was first time he felt like he was in danger as Combs' assistant.
    


            James said he gave his notice soon after the incident, offering to stay with Combs for six more months to train a replacement. He left Combs' company in May 2009.
    


            The prosecution's direct questioning of David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, has finished.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo is now questioning James on cross-examination.
    


            David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified about an incident when one of Combs' Cartier bracelets went missing, prompting his security to search through all of his and his then-girlfriend's belongings. James said he felt he couldn't refuse the search.
    


            On two other occasions when Combs' possessions went missing, James had to take a lie detector test administered by a man who claimed to have formerly worked for the FBI, he testified. “It was very intimidating,” he said. On both occasions, James' results showed no discrepancies, he said.
    


            James said one of Combs' security agents told him that another former employee, Capricorn Clark, also had to take a lie detector test previously.
    


            David James, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former assistant, is detailing several occasions where he said he supplied Combs' friends with drugs.
    


            On a trip with Combs to Saint-Tropez, a friend of Combs texted James asking him to get cocaine, he testified. James said he arranged for the cocaine for Combs' friend, but said Combs didn't ask him to do it. He said he assumed he had to.
    


            On another occasion, during a party in Los Angeles, James recalled how Combs sent him back to the house to get ecstasy for a friend. James said he went back to Combs' house to get the ecstasy from Combs' medicine bag and brought it back to the party.
    


            David James, an assistant for Sean “Diddy” Combs from 2007 to 2009, testified he saw Combs take drugs and give them to his friends. On a couple occasions, James procured drugs for Combs' friends, he testified.
    


            A person called “One Stop” often brought drugs to Combs, James said. James understood Combs often took Percocet while he was operating his businesses, and preferred to take ecstasy at night, he said.
    


            David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified that occasionally, Combs would ask him to bring certain items — usually an iPod or food — to his hotel rooms while he was staying there.
    


            He recounted an incident in Miami around 2008 when Combs asked him to bring an iPod to his hotel room. James said it took him about an hour to get there, and when he knocked on the door, nobody answered.
    


            He entered the room with his own key and saw Cassie Ventura lying on her back in the hotel room with a white comforter up to her neck.
    


            “She did not move when I entered the room,” he testified.
    


            Combs was in the shower, he said. James mentioned that he did not speak with Combs or Ventura about the incident afterward because it wasn't his job to discuss their personal affairs.
    


            David James, a former assistant for Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified he often set up hotel rooms for Combs. If Combs was staying in New York, his favorite hotel was the Trump International, James said.
    


            James said he would set up things for Combs' before is arrival, including clothing, a toiletry bag, a medicine bag, food and drinks. He said he would organize a collection of about 40 products, mostly skincare, for Combs in the hotel bathroom.
    


            The medicine bag typically carried between 25 and 30 pill bottles, which included ecstasy and Percocet, James said. Some bottles were unmarked, he added.
    


            Combs' security always carried Combs' Louis Vuitton bag, which held personal items and typically $10,000 or more in cash.
    


            James said he would often replenish items for Combs during trips. If he was restocking food and drinks, James said he would pay for them and get reimbursed by Bad Boy Entertainment. When he restocked “personal items,” such as baby oil, lubricant and condoms, James said he would ask security to be reimbursed from the cash in Combs' bag.
    


            When asked if Combs would stay alone when he traveled, James said, “I don't think Mr. Combs ever stayed alone.” While he worked for Combs, James said typically Cassie Ventura would stay with Combs, but there were other women as well, James said.
    


            David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified that he was on the computer at Combs' home one night when Combs was out at a club with Cassie Ventura, another assistant, and security.
    


            “As soon as he entered the door, he bee-lined straight for me” and pulled up the computer's search history, James said. Combs told him that someone had written a blog post “lying” about him hitting Ventura, and he wanted to see if James had written it, the former assistant testified.
    


            James said he did not see Ventura that night, but two days later, Combs directed him to bring her food at a nearby hotel. When James brought the food to her hotel room, he was “surprised” to see a member of Combs' staff answer the door instead of Ventura herself. She stayed at the hotel for about a week, he testified.
    


            David James, an assistant for Sean “Diddy” Combs from 2007 to 2009, testified he did not personally observe physical violence between Combs and Cassie Ventura, but heard them argue about her career more than once.
    


            In those arguments, she would express a desire to branch out more into modeling and acting, but Combs would tell her she had to focus on her music career, James testified.
    


Remember: James worked for Combs during the early portion of Combs' relationship with Ventura. Ventura had testified she signed a contract with Combs' company, Bad Boy Records, in early 2006; the pair first began dating around 2007 and split in 2018.
    


            James testified yesterday that Combs had several girlfriends while James worked for him. He described Kim Porter – who shared three children with Combs – as Combs' “main girlfriend,” and then listed four other women, including Ventura, who were his “other girlfriends.”
    


            David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, is back on the stand. The jury is entering now.
    


            Prosecutor Christy Slavik is continuing her questioning.
    


            Sean “Diddy” Combs' sister is in court today. His children and mother — who have been inside the courtroom on other days — are not yet there today.
    


            Combs is wearing a heather blue sweater, a white collared shirt and dark gray pants. He's talking to his attorney Mac Agnifilo as we wait for court to begin.
    


            Like yesterday, it appears the start of testimony this morning will be delayed because not all jurors are are there.
    


            Four jurors are not yet there, a courtroom deputy said. Yesterday, proceedings were delayed because a juror was running late.
    


            When proceedings do resume: David James, an assistant for Sean “Diddy” Combs from 2007 to 2009, is expected to resume testimony that he started yesterday. James is the first of Combs' former assistants to testify in Combs' racketeering and sex trafficking trial, and the seventh witness to be called by prosecutors so far.
    


            Prosecutors and defense attorneys are debating upcoming testimony from David James, who will continue testifying this morning, and Cassie Ventura's mother, Regina Ventura, who's expected to take the stand later today.
    


            Prosecutors argue Regina Ventura can testify that in December 2011, Sean “Diddy” Combs demanded she pay him $20,000 for money he spent on her daughter after he learned she was romantically involved with Kid Cudi. The money demand came within days of Combs allegedly threatening Cassie Ventura and Kid Cudi and threatening to release sexually explicit videos of her.
    


            Regina Ventura took out a loan and wired the money to Combs. The money was wired back to her without explanation days later. The government has bank records to support the transactions.
    


            Prosecutors say the jury should hear this evidence they say speaks to the coercive control Combs held over Casandra Ventura.
    


            The defense objected to the testimony, saying it would be prejudicial to Combs highlighting the economic disparity between him and the Ventura family. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo also noted Combs gave the money back.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian said Agnifilo could object to the testimony when it comes up during Regina Ventura's testimony later today and he'd deal with it then.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian is on the bench. The jury is expected to come in at 9 a.m. ET.
    


            The jury in Sean “Diddy” Combs' racketeering and sex-trafficking trial heard testimony from three witnesses yesterday.
    


Here's what they said:



Dawn Richard, a former member of the musical group Danity Kane:



Kerry Morgan, friend of Ventura from 2001 to 2018:

Live Updates


            • Battle over Trump's agenda: President Donald Trump expressed confidence after meeting with House Republicans on Capitol Hill this morning as he made a personal pitch for passing his sweeping tax and spending cuts bill. Trump urged House Republicans to stop negotiating and move ahead with the bill and warned them to stay away from changes to Medicaid, sources in the meeting told CNN, as GOP holdouts threaten to stall his agenda amid several sticking points. 



            • Top administration officials testify: Several Cabinet secretaries are in the hot seat on Capitol Hill today — including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — as they defend their agencies' budgets in front of respective committees.
    


            • Ukraine war talks: Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that threatening Russia with additional sanctions could cause Moscow to stop talking about a potential end to the war in Ukraine. His remarks come a day after Trump's call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio faced the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today for the first time since his confirmation hearing and he defended his overhaul of the State Department amid a proposed rescission of $20 billion in funding.
    


            He is expected testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee later today, as well as the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Appropriations Committee over the next two days.
    


Here's what else Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations committee: 



            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that the continued involvement of the United States in peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia was “important,” as he voiced his country's commitment to further direct talks with the Kremlin.
    


                    “We are discussing with our partners the details and ideas from yesterday's conversation with US President (Donald) Trump. It is important that America continues to be a participant in the peace-making process,” Zelensky said following yesterday's call between Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.
                





            “It is America that they fear in Russia. It is American influence that can save many lives if it influences Putin for the sake of ending the war,” Zelensky said.
    


            Following his two-hour call with Putin, Trump said Ukraine and Russia must talk directly, “as only they can.”
    


            The Ukrainian president added that discussions were underway regarding future direct talks between Ukraine and Russia.
    


            “We continue to work at various levels with the United States on sanctions. We are convincing them that this is what is needed to prevent Putin from lying about ending the war. Time will prove us right,” Zelensky said.
    


            Earlier today, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that threatening Russia with additional sanctions could cause Moscow to stop talking about a potential end to the war with Ukraine.
    


            President Donald Trump and GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky found themselves in a familiar position earlier today as the commander-in-chief met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill: opposing each other.
    


            Walking into his closed-door meeting with House Republicans, Trump singled out Massie directly, who opposes the president's legislative agenda.
    


                    “I don't think Thomas Massie understands government. I think he's a grandstander, frankly,” Trump said ahead of the meeting. “We don't even talk to him much. I think he should be voted out of office.”
                





            Massie told CNN that inside the room, Trump called him out “eight times.” But he said the president was nicer to him there than his public comments would reflect, and the lawmaker made light of the ire he faces from the president.
    


            “I was flattered,” Massie said. “I wasn't offended by anything he said.”
    


            Massie is comfortable being the lone no vote against Trump, and he has staked out a rare position in the Republican Party where he finds his most consistent company to be his state's senator, GOP Sen. Rand Paul.
    


            While he predicted his Republican colleagues would cave to Trump's demands, Massie said he remains immovable.
    


                    “It's math, is what it is,” he said. “If this vote were based on intuition or likeability of the president, I might vote yes. But it's not. Not for me. There are real consequences. And they probably have the votes anyway to pass it. I think he was talking to the people who have leaned no, trying to persuade them more than me.”
                





            President Donald Trump had a blunt message for Republicans during his meeting with the House GOP conference this morning: Stop negotiating and move ahead with his massive domestic policy bill, according to sources in the room.
    


            It was a message directed to the hard-right House Freedom Caucus and a group of Northeastern lawmakers who are making demands to change the bill.
    


            Trump also had an exchange with GOP New York Rep. Mike Lawler, who made his case for a higher cap on state and local tax deductions, according to a source in room.
    


            Trump's message: Time to stop haggling and move ahead with vote.
    


            Elon Musk on Tuesday said he would spend “a lot less” on politics moving forward – potentially signaling a retreat on the part of President Donald Trump's largest campaign benefactor and one of the most controversial figures to emerge in his administration.
    


                    “I think, in terms of political spending, I'm going to do a lot less in the future,” the Tesla CEO said during an interview at the Qatar Economic Forum.
                





            When he was asked why, Musk said: “I think I've done enough.”
    


            But Musk also left the door open to changing his mind, adding: “If I see a reason do political spending in the future, I will do it.”
    


            Musk, the world's richest man, spent more than $290 million in the 2024 campaign to help elect Trump and Republicans to Congress and previously committed to putting $100 million into political groups controlled by Trump, CNN and other outlets have reported.
    


            It's not clear whether the Tesla CEO's remarks signal any change in that financial pledge. A Musk political aide on Tuesday declined to comment.
    


More context: Musk's prominent role in slashing federal spending through his work with the Department of Government Efficiency has made him a prominent political target for Democrats, who made him the centerpiece of their winning strategy in last month's election for a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat.
    


            Musk has begun to pull back from his once-prominent role in the administration.
    


            In the at-times contentious interview Tuesday, Musk insisted that his position in government does not pose a conflict of interest with his varied business interests. “I'm simply an adviser,” Musk said. “I don't have formal power.”

            President Donald Trump told House Republicans directly this morning to not let the debate over state and local taxes, known as SALT, impede the passage of his legislative agenda, according to a senior White House official.
    


                    “The President also made it clear he's losing patience with all holdout factions of the House Republican Conference, including the SALT Caucus and the House Freedom Caucus. The President is clear: he wants EVERY Republican to vote yes,” according to the official.
                





            Trump told reporters after the meeting that he never said he was “losing patience” and that it was a “meeting of love.” But several holdouts indicated after the meeting that they still weren't sold on the massive tax bill.
    


What is the SALT caucus?: It's a loose coalition of roughly a half-dozen Republicans from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California who have sought to repeal the 2017 deduction cap on state and local taxes.
    


            It's unclear if President Donald Trump was able to move the needle with key Republican hardliners who are currently opposed to approving his sweeping legislative agenda.
    


Here's what some lawmakers are saying: 



House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris poured cold water on the idea that  Trump moved the needle in convincing him and other hardliners to soften their positions.
    


            “No, we are still a ways away, but we can get there,” said Harris, who has called for more time to work through the negotiations. The Maryland GOP congressman said this closed-door meeting was not the venue to raise his continued opposition.
    


Louisiana Rep. Clay Higgins, who like other hardliners want more time with the bill, told CNN he wasn't sure if Trump changed his mind to vote this week.
    


            Still, Higgins called Trump a “unifier” as he left the meeting and said the president acknowledged the opposing groups in the House Republican conference.
    


                    “He's comfortable with every faction that exists within our conference,” Higgins said. “He is completely respectful of the positions of various factions, including my own, who feel very strongly.”
                





            Meanwhile, South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson called the meeting with the president “powerful” and said that “you could tell that he did move the room.”
    


            “That is as animated as I've seen him on policy issues,” Johnson said.
    


                    The president, he said, “has grown frustrated with the pace of our progress. He made it pretty clear we need to quit screwing around.”
                





South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman said Trump did a “great job” in his meeting with House Republicans on Tuesday, but did not yet commit to voting for the bill.
    


            “My understanding he just wants the bill passed. Whether there's modifications, he wants the bill passed,” he said, adding that the House Rules Committee, which he sits on, still plans to meet overnight to advance the bill.

This post has been updated with additional comments from GOP lawmakers. 



            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday said habeas corpus “is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country” – misstating the legal principle that President Donald Trump is considering suspending to accelerate deportations.
    


            During a hearing in front of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Noem was asked by Democratic New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan to define the legal concept.
    


            Noem responded: “Well, habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country, and suspend their right to – ”
    


            Hassan cut her off: “Excuse me, that's incorrect.” She explained it's a legal principle that requires the government to provide a reason for detaining people. It allows people who believe they are being unlawfully detained or imprisoned to petition for their release in court.
    


            Under further questioning, Noem said she supports habeas corpus but added: “I also recognize that the president of the United States has the authority under the Constitution to decide if it should be suspended or not.”
    


Meanwhile with regards to a DHS reality show, Noem said there are “no plans whatsoever” for her agency to participate in one.
    


            Her comments come after CNN and other outlets reported that a reality TV producer submitted a pitch for the agency to participate in a show where immigrants compete against each other for US citizenship.
    


            President Donald Trump warned Republican lawmakers not to touch Medicaid except for waste fraud and abuse during today's meeting, according to two sources.
    


            Trump said “don't f**ck around” on Medicaid, according to the sources in the room. His comments come as questions have been raised over how many Americans would lose access to Medicaid benefits under Republicans' proposed package.
    


            Trump also repeated his message that Democratic governors are to blame for high state and local taxes and said they need to deal with it, according to a source.
    


            Trump didn't sound particularly warm to fighting for state and local taxes (SALT), the source said.
    


            GOP Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert said Trump was “very serious” about the state and local tax deduction — a key sticking point in talks on his agenda bill.
    


            “I'm from Colorado. I'm a SALT state. I get it. But President Trump is very firm on this bill passing and being a good product,” she said.
    


                    Asked whether holdouts on the bill got the president's message, Boebert said: “President Trump is speaking directly to many people individually.”
                





            Trump is meeting with House GOP members as key conservatives remain opposed to approving his sweeping tax and spending bill.
    


This post has been updated with comments from Boebert. 



            President Donald Trump on Tuesday argued that Republicans are “tremendously unified” despite party infighting over his sweeping budget and tax cuts bill.
    


                    “We have a tremendously unified party. I don't think we've ever had a party like this. There are some people who want a couple of things that maybe I don't like or that they're not going to get,” Trump said arriving on Capitol Hill to meet with the House Republican conference.
                





            He praised House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate GOP leader John Thune, adding that “we're a very unified party.”
    


                    “And we're going to have a bill, the one big, beautiful bill, I think it's going to be – It's the biggest bill ever passed, and we've got to get it done,” Trump said.
                





            He insisted that the bill would provide “the biggest tax cut in the history of our country” and that Republicans are “not changing” Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security, despite the proposal to add work requirements for Medicaid benefits.
    


            “We're not doing any cutting of anything meaningful. The only thing we're cutting is waste, fraud and abuse. With Medicaid, waste fraud and abuse,” he said.
    


            Before going behind closed doors to meet with the House Republican conference, Trump told reporters: “This is really just a pep talk.”
    


            The president acknowledged his tax and spending cuts bill would be amended but that it would move forward as GOP leadership plans to bring it to a vote in the House this week.
    


This post has been updated with more of Trump's remarks. 



            Conservative hardliner Rep. Thomas Massie called the White House's insistence that President Donald Trump's major policy bill would not raise the US deficit “a joke.”
    


            “No, that's a joke. That's a joke,” the Kentucky Republican told CNN while heading into the House GOP meeting that Trump is scheduled to attend.
    


                    “Is Russ Vought saying that? … OK, well, Russ Vought knows better. He's the OMB [Office of Management and Budget] director. I mean, over here, the people in favor of this bill say that under the policies of this bill, we're going to add $20 trillion to debt over the next 10 years, which is $3.5 to $5 trillion more than would have been added otherwise,” he said.
                





            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said yesterday that the sweeping bill aimed to advance Trump's legislative agenda “does not add to the deficit” — despite multiple nonpartisan reports that say otherwise.
    


            Asked if he's concerned about pressure on him to support the bill as it currently stands, Massie told CNN: “They wrote off my vote weeks ago.”
    


            Meanwhile, GOP Rep. Tim Burchett — who's not yet in support of the bill — told CNN that he's concerned about the bill's increase to the SALT tax deduction and wants to see “sufficient” work requirements for Medicaid benefits to “eliminate the fraud.”
    


            “I want to hear what the president has to say,” he said.
    


            House GOP leaders are hoping to pass President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” later this week and send it over to the Senate.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson has been engaging in last-ditch negotiations over several unresolved issues involving Medicaid, green energy tax credits and the state and local tax deduction.
    


Here are key things to know about what is in the bill: 



            • The package includes several controversial measures that would deeply cut into two of the nation's key safety net programs —Medicaid and food stamps — while making permanent essentially all of the trillions of dollars of individual income tax breaks contained in the GOP's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. What's more, it would fulfill Trump's campaign promises to cut taxes on tips and overtime, albeit temporarily.
    


            • The magnitude of the measures is evident in the estimates of the cost they'd incur or the savings they would produce. The tax package approved by the Ways and Means Committee carries a price tag of a little more than $3.8 trillion over 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Meanwhile, the Energy and Commerce plan, which contains contentious cuts to Medicaid, would reduce the deficit by at least $880 billion over a decade, according to an initial Congressional Budget Office analysis.
    


            • Republicans are aiming to make good on other Trump campaign promises, such as significant investments in staffing at the US southern border, new systems to discourage immigration into the US and a gigantic new missile defense shield. Then there are other longtime GOP policy goals, such as an overhaul of the nation's outdated air traffic system, new fees targeting electric cars and a pivot away from federal student loans.
    


            • Overall, the House is looking for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset the legislation's sweeping tax breaks and investments in defense and immigration control. The measures could still change before they are voted on by the full chamber, and Senate Republicans are likely to make additional changes even after the House passes the legislation.
    


Read more about what is in the House GOP package.



            President Donald Trump has arrived on Capitol Hill, where he will meet with House Republicans Tuesday as they negotiate his sweeping tax and spending cuts package.
    


            Trump's visit to the Capitol comes as he aims to unite Republicans in pushing through his legislative agenda, which House Speaker Johnson hopes to pass by Memorial Day.
    


            This marks the sixth time that Trump has been on Capitol Hill this year for various engagements including a meeting with Republican senators during the transition period, his indoor Inauguration ceremony, the National Prayer Breakfast, Friends of Ireland luncheon and delivering an address to a joint session of Congress.
    


            Trump's motorcade departed from the North Lawn, without an opportunity for press to shout questions.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio plans to defend his overhaul of the State Department to lawmakers amid a proposed rescission of $20 billion in funding.
    


            Rubio is facing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday morning for the first time since his confirmation hearing. He will also testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee, the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Appropriations Committee over the next two days.
    


            Although he was unanimously confirmed as top US diplomat, some Democrats have since expressed regret and disappointment at Rubio's foreign policy stances as well as his overseeing of the destruction of the US Agency for International Development and sweeping changes at the State Department.
    


            According to his prepared opening statement, Rubio plans to argue that a proposed budget of $28.5 billion “will allow the Department to fulfill its mission while also proposing the rescission of $20 billion in duplicative, wasteful, and ideologically driven programs.” Such a proposal is tens of billions of dollars lower than past State Department budgets.
    


            Rubio plans to say that the budget reflects the State Department's reorganization, which includes a 15% staffing cut and has rattled the workforce.
    


                    “A core principle of this reorganization is the belief that what matters is not the size of budgets but the agility with which they can be deployed,” he will say, according to his prepared remarks.
                





            The top US diplomat will claim that the State Department has “found billions” in foreign aid awards “diverted to ideological causes, including climate activism, diversity, equity, inclusion, and LGBTQ initiatives in foreign nations.”
    


            As he has done in the past, he will applaud “the world's most talented diplomatic workforce,” but plans to say that “they deserve better.”
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that President Donald Trump will call on House Republicans “to get in line” to pass his legislative agenda this morning.
    


            Johnson said he had just gotten off the phone with Trump, who was on his way to Capitol Hill
    


                    “He's excited to talk to House republicans this morning, and we're excited to have him,” the speaker said.
                





            “This is a big week for his agenda, for all of us. we've been working on reconciliation for more than a year, as you all know, and it all comes down to these details,” Johnson said.
    


            “And I think the president is going to encourage everyone this morning to get in line and get the votes done. We need to deliver this to the American people, the America first agenda is all wrapped up in one big bill, and we're really excited to deliver it this morning so we're delighted.”
    


            Meanwhile, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said that Trump is “always the closer,” and the president wanted to come speak with everyone on Capitol Hill again.
    


            Scalise Pushed back on Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris' previous suggestion that Republicans delay debate on the current draft of the legislative bill further, saying GOP leadership's plan is still to hold a full House vote Wednesday or Thursday.
    


This post has been updated with reporting on Scalise's remarks.  



            As President Donald Trump trades the Oval Office for the halls of Congress today, his main priority is to urge his party to stop squabbling and make progress on moving a major piece of legislation that contains his core promises from the campaign trail, White House officials tell CNN.
    


            While House Republicans remain sharply divided over a number of sticking points in the $4 trillion bill, the reality from the president's point of view is that he has succeeded in getting what he wants in the package, the officials said.
    


            His campaign-driven goals to deliver sweeping tax cuts and no tax on tips and overtime pay are what Trump cares most about — the rest is simply negotiating to the finish line.
    


            Still, Trump has a monumental task before him to try and bring the factions of the party together. With a slim majority in the House leaving little room for detractors, his attempt to do so will be a major test of his dealmaking abilities.
    


            As of this morning, Trump had not directly engaged in whipping the vote of individual members, the officials said, though several of his aides have been closely involved in behind-the-scenes negotiations.
    


                    “The White House isn't freaking out yet,” one person close to Trump told CNN. “The president has been down this road before. He and the team understand that pushing through a bill of this size is going to take time. The key is starting the clock.”
                





            The White House officials said the president likely will not get into the specific, nitty-gritty details that are still being worked out.
    


            His main task is to ensure the House GOP understands the process of muscling this bill through begins in earnest.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson did not come to a resolution with members of the SALT (state and local tax) caucus last night, but members were promised more data in the morning and that talks will continue.
    


            “We are continuing to work on it. Not a final resolution yet but I think we are getting close,” Johnson told reporters following the roughly one-hour meeting late Monday evening.
    


            Following the meeting, New York Rep. Andrew Garbarino said leadership presented lawmakers with “proposals” to consider but they are seeking additional clarity and data.
    


                    “They hope to have some numbers back to us by the morning,” Garbarino added. “The speaker is doing everything he can to get us to yes and I think everybody in that room really appreciates the meeting.”
                





            Trump plans to make his pitch to Republicans at a meeting at the US Capitol today, CNN previously reported.
    


            Republican leadership is targeting a Wednesday or Thursday floor vote.
    


            When pressed on when the floor vote will be, Johnson maintained: “We'll have it before Memorial Day.”
    


What is the SALT caucus?: It's a loose coalition of roughly a half-dozen Republicans from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California who have sought to repeal the 2017 deduction cap on state and local taxes.
    


            US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke for two hours on the phone yesterday. It's the third known time the two leaders spoke since Trump was inaugurated in January and comes as he has grown increasingly frustrated with the Russian president's refusal to strike a peace deal with Ukraine.
    


            Before talking to Putin, Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
    


Here's what we know about developments after the Trump-Putin call:



What Putin said: The Russian president said the conversation with Trump was “frank and substantive,” and thanked him for US support in “resuming the direct talks between Russia and Ukraine,” according to Russia state news agency TASS. Putin also said Trump “expressed his position on the secession of hostilities, ceasefire, and from my end, I have emphasized that Russia stands for peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis. We just need to outline the most effective routes of moving towards peace.” The two leaders did not discuss a timeframe for talks, a Kremlin spokesperson said.
    


What Trump said: “Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War,” Trump announced on Truth Social after his call. “The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of.” Trump also said that the “tone and spirit” of his conversation with Putin “were excellent,” and that “Russia wants to do largescale TRADE” with the US when the war is over.



Trump informs allies: Trump also said on Truth Social that after his call with Putin ended, he immediately informed the following leaders about the contents of the call after it ended: Zelensky, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Finnish President Alexander Stubb.
    


How Zelensky responded: Zelensky called for further sanctions on the Russian banking and energy sectors. He said a future location for a next round of talks — which would be aimed first at achieving a ceasefire — would be discussed. Zelensky also said Ukraine will not withdraw any of its troops from Russian-held regions of its country. Zelensky also said Russia was “trying to buy time” in negotiations in order to continue its war, after the call between Trump and Putin failed to extract concessions from the Russian leader.
    


US-Russia prisoner swap: Putin and Trump also discussed a US-Russia prisoner swap, involving nine people for nine others, Kremlin presidential aide Yury Ushakov said.
    


On the ground: Ukraine and Russia accused each other of launching attack drones on one another overnight, hours after Putin spoke by phone with Trump.
    


            President Donald Trump will make a personal pitch to House Republicans to pass his “big, beautiful bill” at a meeting at the Capitol today, according to four people familiar with the plans.
    


            Trump will deliver remarks at the House GOP conference meeting at 9 a.m. ET.
    


            It will be the first time Trump will speak in person with the full group of House Republicans since the conference began drafting the president's agenda.
    


What to know: House Republican leaders are still trying to resolve major internal battles over Trump's massive domestic policy bill even as Speaker Mike Johnson is engaged in last-ditch negotiations to win over GOP members' conflicting demands before an expected floor vote later this week.

            After the United States lost its last perfect credit rating on Friday, Republicans and Democrats responded by pointing fingers at each other.
    


            Moody's Ratings said problematic debt levels far outpacing government revenue led to the downgrade. Now, it's up to lawmakers on both sides to take actions to improve the nation's fiscal situation, or another downgrade could be in the cards. And that one would likely be even more painful.
    


            Yet, days later, House Republicans on the Budget Committee voted to advance a sweeping legislative agenda that could worsen the fiscal picture, adding over $1 trillion to annual deficits by 2034 compared to 2024, according to preliminary estimates from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
    


            However, it's far from a done deal, as it faces a slew of hurdles in both chambers of Congress despite Republicans having a majority. Even Trump administration officials have suggested the agenda, dubbed the “one, big, beautiful bill,” could be modified to get it to the finish line.

Here's what's in the House GOP's sweeping tax and spending cuts package



            But some Trump administration officials insist the agenda, which calls for trillions of dollars in tax cuts that exceed a wide array of spending cuts, won't add to the nation's budget deficit, the gap between what the government collects in revenue versus how much it spends. That difference is financed by borrowing money from people who invest in US bonds and Treasuries, which pay a varying amount of interest, also known as the yield.
    


            For instance, White House Council of Economic Advisers Chair Stephen Miran said in a CNBC interview on Monday that efforts included in the bill to “cut waste, fraud and abuse are going to end up bringing the deficit down by almost half a point of GDP, or maybe even a little bit more than that.”
    


            Earlier in the day, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, “This bill does not add to the deficit.”
    


            Had Moody's not downgraded US debt two days prior, Republican lawmakers in particular may have been more willing to take such comments at face value. But now, with the fiscal situation back in the spotlight, more diligence could be warranted.
    


            “Moody's downgrade reflects concerns stemming from years of bad fiscal decisions in Washington,” Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peter Peterson Foundation, which advocates for America's fiscal stability, told CNN. The country already is on track to add $22 trillion more to the $36 trillion debt level over the next decade, he said. President Donald Trump's bill “would only accelerate the pace of borrowing by adding trillions to this already unsustainable path.”
    


            On Monday, investors took note of the risks Moody's outlined in explaining its decision to downgrade US debt to one notch below perfect. Key to that was “the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,” Moody's said in its Friday statement.
    


            Yields on 30-year US bonds soared by over a percentage point, touching 5% at one point on Monday, while yields on shorter-term debt held by the US government also rose. Both point to the same message: The risks of investing in American debt, long considered the safest asset, have grown.

            Consumers, just like the government, tend to have to pay more to borrow money when yields rise since banks and other lenders often base interest rates on US Treasury and bond yields.
    


            “With our divisive politics preventing progress, it's no surprise that financial markets are watching — and increasingly worried,” Peterson added.
    


            Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, similarly alluded to rising yields on US debt as a wake-up call for lawmakers. “The government deficit isn't a problem until investors think it is. And they're increasingly telling us that the deficit is a problem,” Cox said in a note on Monday.
    


            Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said the downgrade increases the odds that Trump's package, if passed, will carry fewer tax cuts than what's currently being proposed to minimize the deficit impact.
    


            “The downgrade will catch the attention of the fiscal hawks and make it unlikely that some of the proposed features, including no taxes on overtime and an enhanced standard deduction for seniors aged 65 and older that are not in our baseline, will be included in the fiscal package,” he said in a note on Monday.
    


            Sweet also said the downgrade will likely extend the length of time it takes to pass the bill, if at all. Meanwhile, top Trump administration officials, including National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, say they're optimistic it'll pass by the middle of this summer.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver is being charged with assault after a skirmish with federal officers outside an immigration detention center, said New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, who also announced Monday that she was dropping a trespassing case against the Newark mayor whose arrest led to the disturbance.

Interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba wrote on social media that McIver is facing a charge of assaulting, impeding or interfering with law enforcement, but court papers providing details were not immediately released or publicly available online.

The prosecution of McIver is a rare federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress for allegations other than fraud or corruption. The case instantly taps into a much broader and more consequential power struggle between a Trump administration engaged in a sweeping overhaul of immigration policy and a Democratic party scrambling for ways to respond.

Within minutes of Habba's announcement, McIver's Democratic colleagues cast the prosecution as an infringement on lawmakers' official duties to serve their constituents and an effort to silence their opposition to an immigration policy that helped propel the president back into power but now has emerged as divisive fault line in American political discourse.

At the same time, Habba announced that her office agreed to dismiss a misdemeanor charge against Democratic Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested after he attempted to join McIver and two other members of New Jersey's congressional delegation inspecting the facility in their oversight capacity. Habba said the decision was reached “for the sake of moving forward” and said she has invited the mayor to tour the Delaney Hall detention center and will join him herself. 




“The citizens of New Jersey deserve unified leadership so we can get to work to keep our state safe,” Habba said in a statement. 

McIver has denied any wrongdoing and has accused federal agents of escalating the situation by arresting the mayor. She denounced the charge as “purely political” and said prosecutors are distorting her actions in an effort to deter legislative oversight. 

“This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right,” she said in a statement. “I am thankful for the outpouring of support I have received and I look forward to the truth being laid out clearly in court.”

A nearly two-minute clip released by the Homeland Security Department shows McIver on the facility side of a chain-link fence just before the arrest of the mayor on the street side of the fence. She and uniformed officials go through the gate and she joins others shouting “surround the mayor.” The video shows McIver in a tightly packed group of people and officers. At one point her left elbow and then her right elbow push into an officer wearing a dark face covering and an olive green uniform emblazoned with the word “Police” on it.

It isn't clear from bodycam video whether that contact was intentional, incidental or a result of jostling in the chaotic scene.

In a post on X, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said McIver was being charged after a “thorough review of the video footage” and investigation by Homeland Security Investigations.

“Assaults on federal law enforcement will not be tolerated,” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a post on X. “This Administration will always protect those who work tirelessly to keep America safe.”

McIver's attorney called the decision to charge her “spectacularly inappropriate,” saying she went to Delaney Hall “to do her job” and she has the responsibility as a member of Congress to oversee U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's treatment of detainees. As of Monday night, neither McIver nor her attorneys had gotten charging documents from prosecutors, according to an emailed statement from a spokesperson for her attorney.

“Rather than facilitating that inspection, ICE agents chose to escalate what should have been a peaceful situation into chaos,” Paul Fishman, the former U.S. attorney for New Jersey, said in a statement. “This prosecution is an attempt to shift the blame for ICE's behavior to Congresswoman McIver. In the courtroom, facts — not headlines — will matter.”

Baraka, who is seeking the Democratic nomination in this year's governor's race, had repeatedly denied trespassing and said he had been invited inside the gate at one point before the arrest.

He said in an emailed statement Monday that he was glad the case against him was dismissed. He said he will “continue to advocate for the humane treatment of detainees” and “continue to press the facility to ensure that it is compliant with City of Newark codes and regulations.” 

Baraka called McIver a “daughter of Newark” and said he stood with her.

“I fully expect her to be vindicated,” he said.

McIver, 38, first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep. Donald Payne Jr. left a vacancy in the 10th District. She was then elected to a full term in November. A Newark native, she served as the president of the Newark City Council from 2022 to 2024 and worked in the city's public schools before that.

House Democratic leaders decried the criminal case against their colleague in a lengthy statement in which they called the charge “extreme, morally bankrupt” and lacking “any basis in law or fact.”

“The proceeding initiated by the so-called U.S. Attorney in New Jersey is a blatant attempt by the Trump administration to intimidate Congress and interfere with our ability to serve as a check and balance on an out-of-control executive branch,” said the statement from Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York and other senior members of the party. “House Democrats will not be intimidated by the Trump administration. Not today. Not ever.”

The creator of the Dilbert comic strip, which was canceled by most newspapers two years ago over the creator's racist comments, said Monday that he has been diagnosed with the same aggressive prostate cancer as former President Joe Biden.

“I have the same cancer that Joe Biden has,” Scott Adams said Monday during an episode of his YouTube show, “Real Coffee with Scott Adams. “So, I also have prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones.”

He made the announcement after extending his “respect and compassion and sympathy” for Biden and his family. Biden announced his diagnosis on Sunday and said he and his family were reviewing treatment options with his doctors.

Adams, 67, said he's always in pain, uses a walker to get around and that he expects to die sometime this summer. 

“It's basically intolerable,” he said of the pain.

Adams said he has had time to process his diagnosis and that it has given him time to say goodbyes, get his affairs in order and do all the things he needed to do.

Dilbert the comic strip first appeared in 1989, poking fun at office culture. It ran for decades in numerous newspapers but disappeared with lightning speed in 2023 following racist remarks by Adams. 

On his YouTube show at the time, among other things, he described Black people as a “hate group” and said he would no longer “help Black Americans.” 

He later said he was being hyperbolic, yet continued to defend his stance.




Various media publishers across the U.S. denounced the comments as racist, hateful and discriminatory while saying they would no longer provide a platform for his work. 

The editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, which dumped “Dilbert” in 2022, said the comic strip “went from being hilarious to being hurtful and mean.”

(Magali Girardin/Keystone via AP)

















GENEVA (AP) — World Health Organization member countries on Tuesday approved an agreement to better prevent, prepare for and respond to future pandemics in the wake of the devastation wrought by the coronavirus. 

Sustained applause echoed in a Geneva hall hosting the WHO's annual assembly as the measure — debated and devised over three years — passed without opposition. 

The U.S., traditionally the top donor to the U.N. health agency, was not part of the final stages of pandemic agreement process after the Trump administration announced a U.S. pullout from the WHO.

Many world leaders offered words of support for the U.N. health agency, and praised the show of multilateralism.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, speaking by video, congratulated WHO and the other member states, calling the accord “a shared commitment to fight future pandemics with greater cooperation while building a healthy planet.”

While many supporters praised the “historic” deal, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. delivered a scathing critique of the U.N. health agency, saying the United States was working with unspecified “like-minded” countries to improve the global health system and called on health ministers in others to join.

“Like many legacy institutions, the WHO has become mired in bureaucratic bloat, entrenched paradigms, conflicts of interest and international power politics,” Kennedy said in a video statement. “We don't have to suffer the limits of a moribund WHO. Let's create new institutions or revisit existing institutions that are clean, efficient, transparent and accountable.”




The U.S. administration cited the WHO's “mishandling of COVID-19” and failure to enact needed reforms, and “China's demonstrated political influence” over science and policy at the agency, the State Department said in an email. 

The U.S. was not sending a delegation for the assembly, which runs through May 27. 

“I urge the world's health ministers and the WHO to take our withdrawal from the organization as a wake-up call,” Kennedy said. “It isn't that President (Donald) Trump and I have lost interest in international cooperation. Not at all. We just want it to happen in a way that's fair and efficient and transparent for all the member states.”

China, meanwhile, was doubling down its support for WHO — both politically and financially. 

Vice Premier Liu Guozhong said “all sides need to firmly support the WHO to play a central coordinating in global health governance, (and) support WHO to perform its duty in an independent, professional and science-based manner.”

China, he said through a translator, “will provide an additional quota of financial support to the WHO that can add up to $500 million in the coming five years,” without specifying. It was not immediately clear whether that amounted to a new financial commitment from Beijing.

The United States — whose contributions to WHO have been halted — had been set to contribute more than $700 million to the current 2024-2025 budget, while China was poised to chip in more than $200 million, according to the U.N. health agency's website.

French President Emmanuel Macron said “some believe they can do without science,” an apparent allusion to U.S. funding cuts for research.

“Not only will that harm the health of us all, but it's first of all the population of those who are taking a step back, in a way, who will be in real danger in the face of emerging pathogens that they wouldn't see coming,” Macron told the assembly by video.

The treaty's effectiveness will also face doubts because the United States — which poured billions into speedy work by pharmaceutical companies to develop COVID-19 vaccines — is not taking part, and because countries face no penalties if they ignore it.

Even though it has been adopted, some hard work remains. 

Countries hope to adopt by next year's assembly an annex to the treaty that would guarantee that countries that share virus samples will receive tests, medicines and vaccines used to fight pandemics, under what's called the Pathogen Access and Benefits Sharing system. Under it, up to 20% of such products would be given to WHO to make sure that developing countries have some access to them. 

Dr. Esperance Luvindao, Namibia's health minister and the chair of a committee that paved the way for Tuesday's adoption, said that the COVID-19 pandemic inflicted huge costs “on lives, livelihoods and economies.”

“We — as sovereign states — have resolved to join hands, as one world together, so we can protect our children, elders, frontline health workers and all others from the next pandemic,” Luvindao added. “It is our duty and responsibility to humanity.”

President Donald Trump, alongside his wife, Melania, signed the Take It Down Act, a measure the first lady helped usher through Congress to set stricter penalties for the distribution of non-consensual intimate imagery online, or “revenge porn.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday signed into law the Take It Down Act, a measure that imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation that first lady Melania Trump helped usher through Congress, and he had her sign it, too, despite what sounded like a mild objection on her part. 

“C'mon, sign it anyway,” the president told his wife. “She deserves to sign it,” he said. 

After she added her signature, the president held up the document to show both of their names to the audience at the ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. Melania Trump's signature is merely symbolic since first ladies are not elected and they play no role in the enactment of legislation.

In March, Melania Trump used her first public appearance since resuming the role of first lady to travel to Capitol Hill to lobby House members to pass the bill following its approval by the Senate. 

At a signing ceremony, she called the new law a “national victory” that will help protect children from online exploitation, including through the use of artificial intelligence to make fake images.

“AI and social media are the digital candy for the next generation, sweet addictive and engineered to have an impact on the cognitive development of our children,” she said. “But unlike sugar, these new technologies can be weaponized, shape beliefs and, sadly, affect emotions and even be deadly.”

The president said the proliferation of images made using AI means that “countless women have been harassed with deepfakes and other explicit images distributed against their will.” He said what's happening is “just so horribly wrong.” 




“Today, we're making it totally illegal,” Trump said. 

The bill makes it a federal crime to “knowingly publish” or threaten to publish intimate images without a person's consent, including AI-created “deepfakes.” Websites and social media companies will be required to remove such material within 48 hours after a victim requests it. The platforms must also take steps to delete duplicate content. 

Many states have already banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn, but the Take It Down Act is a rare example of federal regulators imposing on internet companies.

The bill, introduced by Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, passing the House in April by a 409-2 vote and clearing the Senate by unanimous consent. 

But the measure isn't without critics. Free speech advocates and digital rights groups say the bill is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate images, including legal pornography and LGBTQ content. Others say it could allow the government to monitor private communications and undermine due process.

The first lady appeared at a Capitol Hill roundtable with lawmakers and young women who had explicit images of them put online, saying it was “heartbreaking” to see what teenagers and especially girls go through after this happens to them. She also included a victim among her guests for the president's address to a joint session of Congress the day after that meeting.

After the House passed the bill, Melania Trump said the bipartisan vote was a “powerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy and safety of our children.”

Her advocacy for the bill represents a continuation of the Be Best campaign she started in the president's first term, focusing on children's well-being, social media use and opioid abuse.

In his speech to Congress in March, the president said he looked forward to signing the bill.

“And I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don't mind,” he said, adding, that there's nobody who “gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.”

The first few aid trucks have entered Gaza following nearly three months of Israel's blockade of food, medicine and other supplies, Israel and the United Nations said Monday, as Israel acknowledged growing pressure from allies including the United States.

The Israeli military released a video on Monday showing what they say are troops operating in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile after a nearly three-month blockade and warnings by global experts of impeding famine, Israel says it will allow a limited amount of humanitarian aid into Gaza even as it launches “extensive” new ground operations there.

Doctors worked to treat injured children on Monday at a hospital in southern Gaza. A group of Palestinian men also sat by the wrapped body of a leader of the armed wing of a Palestinian militant group which said he was killed in a shootout during an Israeli operation in Khan Younis.

Israel has launched a new wave of air and ground operations across Gaza, and the army ordered the evacuation of the enclave's second-largest city, Khan Younis, where Israel carried out a massive operation earlier in the war that left much of the area in ruins.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The first few aid trucks entered Gaza on Monday following nearly three months of Israel's blockade of food, medicine and other supplies, Israel and the United Nations said, as Israel acknowledged growing pressure from allies including the United States.

Five trucks carrying baby food and other desperately needed aid entered the territory of over 2 million Palestinians via the Kerem Shalom crossing, according to the Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, COGAT.

The U.N. humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, called it a “welcome development” but described the trucks as a “drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed.” Food security experts last week warned of famine in Gaza. During the latest ceasefire that Israel ended in March, some 600 aid trucks entered Gaza each day.

Fletcher said an additional four U.N. trucks were cleared to enter Gaza. Those trucks may enter Tuesday, COGAT said. Fletcher added that given the chaotic situation on the ground, the U.N. expects the aid could be looted or stolen, a growing problem as resources became increasingly scarce.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his decision to resume “minimal” aid to Gaza came after allies said they couldn't support Israel's new military offensive if there are “images of hunger” coming from the Palestinian territory.

Shortly after Israel announced the first trucks entered Gaza, the U.K., France and Canada issued a sharply worded joint statement calling the aid “wholly inadequate.” They threatened “concrete actions” against Israel, including sanctions, for its activities in Gaza and the occupied West Bank and called on Israel to stop its “egregious” new military actions in Gaza.




Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the joint statement and called it “a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7.”

Israel over the weekend launched a new wave of air and ground operations across Gaza, and the army ordered the evacuation of its second-largest city, Khan Younis, where a massive operation earlier in the 19-month war left much of the area in ruins.

Israel says it is pressuring Hamas to release the remaining hostages abducted in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. Hamas has said it will only release them in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. 

Netanyahu repeated Monday that Israel plans on “taking control of all of Gaza.” He has said Israel will encourage what he describes as the voluntary emigration of much of Gaza's population to other countries — something that Palestinians have rejected.

In a video statement, Netanyahu said Israel's “greatest friends in the world” had told him, “We cannot accept images of hunger, mass hunger. We cannot stand that. We will not be able to support you.”

The Trump administration, which has voiced full support for Israel's actions and blames Hamas for deaths in Gaza, has expressed growing concern over the hunger crisis. President Donald Trump — who skipped Israel on his trip to the region last week — voiced concern, as did Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Netanyahu's video statement appeared aimed at pacifying anger in his nationalist base at the decision to resume aid. Two far-right governing partners have pressed Netanyahu not to allow aid into Gaza.

Aid into Gaza would be “minimal,” Netanyahu said, and would act as a bridge toward the launch of a new aid system in Gaza. A U.S.-backed organization will distribute assistance in hubs that will be secured by the Israeli military.

Israel says the plan is meant to prevent Hamas from accessing aid, which Israel says it uses to bolster its rule in Gaza.

U.N. agencies and aid groups have rejected the plan, saying it won't reach enough people and would weaponize aid in contravention of humanitarian principles. They have refused to take part.

According to aid officials familiar with the plan, it will involve setting up distribution points mostly in southern Gaza, forcing many Palestinians to move south once again. The recent ceasefire saw hundreds of thousands return to homes in the north.

The statement by France, Canada and the U.K. marked one of their most significant criticisms of Israel's handling of the war in Gaza and Israel's actions in the occupied West Bank.

“We oppose any attempt to expand settlements in the West Bank,” the three countries said, calling them illegal.

The countries said they have always supported Israel's right to defend itself against terrorism but called the military escalation in Gaza disproportionate. The countries earlier criticized the new U.S.-backed proposal for aid delivery in Gaza, saying it would not align with humanitarian law.

Canada has already imposed a series of sanctions against Israel over the last two years regarding settler violence in the West Bank. It was unclear how much France can act unilaterally given that it is a member of the European Union.

In a separate, letter Monday, the foreign ministers of Germany, Italy, Japan and 18 other countries — not including the United States — called for Israel to fully reopen humanitarian aid delivery to Gaza by the U.N. and non-governmental organizations.

The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 others. The militants are still holding 58 captives, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were returned in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel's retaliatory offensive, which has destroyed large swaths of Gaza, has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count.

The war has displaced around 90% of its population, most of them multiple times.

LONDON, Ky. (AP) — More tornadoes plowed through the central U.S. on Monday, ripping apart buildings and knocking out power as people from Texas to Kentucky continued to clean up from days of severe weather that killed more than two dozen people and destroyed thousands of homes and buildings.

At least four tornadoes were confirmed in Oklahoma and Nebraska on Monday evening, according to a preliminary report from the National Weather Service.

Across Oklahoma, at least 10 homes were destroyed and multiple buildings were damaged, including a fire station that was wiped out, according to the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. A spokesperson for the agency said they have not received any reports of injuries or deaths.

Around 115,000 customers were without power in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Missouri, according to PowerOutage.us.

Parts of several highways were also closed due to flooding or storm damage. 

In northwest Arkansas, severe weather caused a Halsey concert to be canceled and a municipal airport had to close temporarily Monday night so crews could remove debris from the field. And in Oklahoma, Tulsa Public Schools canceled all afterschool activities.

Northern Texas saw softball-sized hail measuring 4 1/2 inches (11.4 centimeters) in diameter, according to Scott Kleebauer, a meteorologist with the service's Weather Prediction Center.




Earlier Monday in St. Louis, where officials estimated a Friday tornado damaged 5,000 buildings and may cost well over $1 billion, the mayor warned that federal assistance could take weeks.

Kentucky has been hardest hit by the storms. A devastating tornado late Friday into early Saturday damaged hundreds of homes, tossed vehicles and killed at least 19 people, most of them in southeastern Laurel County.

In London, Kentucky, where the devastation was centered, the small airport became a beehive of cleanup work after it took a direct hit from a tornado. Small aircraft stored there had large dents in them and even wings ripped open. Officials were using it as a base to get water, food, diapers and other supplies out to the community.

“We have 1,001 things going on. But we're managing it. And we're going to get it all cleaned up,” said London Mayor Randall Weddle. 

Officials in Kansas and Texas also were evaluating damage from late Sunday storms.

The risk of severe storms moves into Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee on Tuesday, the weather service said.

The Kentucky storms that killed 19 people were part of a weather system that caused seven deaths in Missouri and two in northern Virginia, authorities said.

Lonnie Nantz hid in a hallway with his wife, two daughters and a grandson as the one-story brick home they bought near London in 1977 was destroyed around them. They were trapped in rubble for about 20 minutes in the midnight darkness before they were rescued unharmed.

“I don't know why this happened. I've tried to live a good life all my life. I've still got the faith,” said the 77-year-old Nantz, who went to church as always on Sunday.

London city worker Ashley Taylor was back on the job Monday loading doughnuts to take to a hospital and dispatch center even though there was a tarp on her roof. She was lucky — the houses across her street were destroyed late Friday night.

She survived the storm with nine other people and three dogs in the crawl space of a neighbor's home.

“We prayed like never before — and just thankful for everything God did for us,” Taylor said.

In surrounding Laurel County, first responders mourned one of their own.

Fellow firefighters found the body of Laurel County Fire Major Leslie Leatherman on top of a woman he was shielding from the storm's fury as he answered calls during the worst of the storm. The woman was yelling for help and they were in a field across from a destroyed subdivision.

The injured woman turned out to be Leatherman's wife and officials aren't sure if he knew who he was protecting in the darkness and chaos, the fire department said on social media.

St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer said five people died, 38 were injured and more than 5,000 homes were affected by an EF3 tornado with winds up to 150 mph (240 kph) that slammed areas north and west of downtown Friday. Spencer has estimated that damages will exceed $1.6 billion. 

“Eight miles of pure destruction, at times a mile wide,” Spencer said at a Monday news conference. “We're talking about thousands of buildings, thousands of families are being displaced.”

The city is awaiting a disaster declaration from the governor's office as a first step to getting federal assistance.

U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, expressed frustration over the federal response to a deadly March storm. 

“I'm not happy about the fact we're still waiting from all of that damage two months ago,” Hawley said.

Acting Federal Emergency Management Agency Chief David Richardson said last week he plans to shift responsibility for disaster recovery to states this year as part of an agencywide transformation and that FEMA would coordinate federal assistance “when deemed necessary.”

Spencer said during a news conference Monday evening that emergency protocols put in place in 2021 were not followed, possibly preventing sirens being activated to warn residents about the tornado. 

She said it was not clear whose responsibility it was to let the community know about the emergency but that the fire department will do so moving forward.

In Texas, several tornadoes touched down west of Fort Worth on Sunday, including an EF1 with peak winds of 105 mph (169 kph) that caused damage in and around Gordon, the weather service said Monday.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum discusses the election of Pope Leo XIV, President Donald Trump's tariff policy and more on ‘The Story.'

EXCLUSIVE: The Trump administration has helped launch the first-ever U.S. mine for a critical mineral largely dominated by China, which controls about half of global production, Fox News Digital has learned.

The Idaho operation will extract and smelt antimony – a metalloid that is key to the U.S. defense and technology sectors – and reduce reliance on malign actors like the CCP – from which about half the world's stock is currently produced.

Antimony has a myriad of national security uses – including in military tools like night-vision goggles, explosives, flame-retardants, tracers, lasers, nuclear weapons production, military clothing and ammunition.

It also plays a role in the bloodless AI arms race, as a component in semiconductors and infrared technology, as well as its use increasing the hardness of alloys like lead and copper.

While not technically considered a rare earth element because of its placement on the periodic table, antimony is considered critical and less common than other elements.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum played a leading role in the groundbreaking effort to boost U.S. energy dominance and self-reliance in terms of critical minerals and natural resources.

The antimony stibnite mine will be used to mine for gold as well, Fox News Digital has learned.

The mine's opening is another example of a critical global supply chain shifting stateside, as Burgum and other officials aim to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign suppliers for national security and economic stability.

The National Energy Dominance Council, an executive branch advisory group founded in February by executive order and led by Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, was a key player in the opening of the mine.

Burgum issued the mine's 404 permit – which governs dredging and discharge into American waters -- on Thursday to Boise-based Perpetua Resources.

Perpetua President Jon Cherry called the achievement the culmination of eight years of study, refinement and ""lots of hard work.""

""We are immensely proud to achieve this milestone. It's time to move forward and take the Stibnite Gold Project into a new and exciting phase of development,"" Cherry said in a statement.

""We believe this [Trump] administration's commitment to boosting efficiency without compromising rigorous environmental standards can have a transformational impact on American mining,"" he added.

The project will also create 550 jobs and, on the gold front, is primed to produce more than 400,000 ounces of the precious metal annually over the next four years.

The antimony stores therein are estimated at 148 million pounds and are the only identified such reserve in the U.S. – and the largest outside China.

It is expected to cut foreign reliance on that critical mineral by one-third.

DHS shares new body camera video footage from the episode at Delaney Hall Detention Center.

The Department of Justice has accused Rep. LaMonica McIver of assaulting two federal agents at the Delaney Hall Detention Facility in New Jersey last month, according to a new charging document.

The document cites bodycam footage from law enforcement officers who recorded events as McIver and two other New Jersey lawmakers stormed the ICE facility. Prosecutors say the first officer McIver allegedly assaulted was a Homeland Security Investigations agent and the second was an ICE agent.

The DOJ accuses McIver of having ""slammed her forearm into the body of a uniformed HSI agent and reached out and tried to restrain the agent by forcibly grabbing him.""

The charging document also states that McIver ""pushed an ICE officer & used her forearms to forcibly strike the agent.""

McIver rejected the charges in a public statement, arguing they are ""purely political.""

""Earlier this month, I joined my colleagues to inspect the treatment of ICE detainees at Delaney Hall in my district,"" she wrote. ""We were fulfilling our lawful oversight responsibilities, as members of Congress have done many times before, and our visit should have been peaceful and short. Instead, ICE agents created an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation when they chose to arrest Mayor Baraka.""

""The charges against me are purely political – they mischaracterize and distort my actions, and are meant to criminalize and deter legislative oversight,"" she continued. ""This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right. I am thankful for the outpouring of support I have received and I look forward to the truth being laid our clearly in court.""

DEM LAWMAKERS DEFEND ‘STORMING' OF ICE FACILITY, SAY TRUMP ADMIN IS ‘LYING AT ALL LEVELS'

Prosecutors say McIver helped create a ""human shield"" and blocked agents from handcuffing Newark Mayor Ras Baraka after he ignored numerous warnings to leave the property and was told he would be arrested.

When the HSI agent told the mayor he was going to arrest him, McIver interjected and yelled ""Hell no! Hell no! Hell no!"" according to the charging document.

The HSI agent then ordered Baraka to put his hands behind his back and displayed his handcuffs. McIver and other members of Congress ""surrounded the Mayor and prevented HSI from handcuffing him and taking him into custody,"" prosecutors say.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem weighed in on the charges against McIver on Monday, saying, ""no one is above the law.""

""If any person, regardless of political party, influence or status, assaults a law enforcement officer as we witnessed Congresswoman McIver do, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" the secretary wrote. ""We thank our brave ICE law enforcement officers for their service to this great nation.""

The J.C. Ames tugboat, sunk in 1923, was recently found in the waters of Lake Michigan near Manitowoc, Wisconsin. (Source: Wisconsin Historical Society)

A long-lost shipwreck sitting in the waters of Lake Michigan was recently discovered by a fisherman – to the surprise of local officials.

The Wisconsin Historical Society announced the discovery on May 16. The tugboat, which was called the J.C. Ames, was built for the lumber trade in 1881. It was intentionally sunk in 1923.

The angler, Christopher Thuss, discovered the ship on a foggy day near the coast of Manitowoc, where it was sitting nine feet below the lake's surface. After spotting the shipwreck, he reported the find to officials.

ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER CENTURIES-OLD SHIPWRECK BENEATH HISTORIC CITY: 'UNIQUE SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE'

""These kinds of discoveries are always so exciting because it allows a piece of lost history to resurface,"" Tamara Thomsen, a maritime archaeologist at the Wisconsin Historical Society, said in a statement. ""It sat there for over 100 years and then came back on our radar completely by chance.""

Thomsen added, ""We are grateful that Chris Thuss noticed the wreck and reported it so we can share this story with the Wisconsin communities that this history belongs to.""

The J.C. Ames tugboat was built in 1881 and dismantled in 1923. (Wisconsin Historical Society)

The J.C. Ames cost $50,000 to build. It was ""one of the largest and most powerful tugs on the lakes,"" according to officials. 

It was damaged in a collision in 1889, but was repaired and changed owners several times before it was discarded.

ARCHAEOLOGIST SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON ASTONISHING DISCOVERY OF WRECKED SLAVE SHIPS: 'STRANDED ON THE COAST'

Thomsen told Fox News Digital the ship had ""outlived its usefulness"" by the time that it was intentionally sunk.

""Abandoning ships that had outlived their use was how it was done back in the day.""

""[The ship] was dismantled at Manitowoc with its engine/boiler removed, towed outside the harbor, burned and abandoned in 1923,"" the historian explained.

She added, ""Abandoning ships that had outlived their use was how it was done back in the day.""

Divers found small artifacts near the wreck of the tugboat, which sank in the 1920s. (Wisconsin Historical Society)

Thomsen also noted that it became somewhat of a spectacle for the ships to be set on fire while they were dismantled.

""They set fire to them and people came out to watch,"" the expert said.

Thomsen also estimates that 13 ships were abandoned in the Maritime Bay near Manitowoc. Divers have only been able to locate three, but they're still keeping their eyes peeled for them.

""We only find them when they are uncovered by storms if someone sees them before they are covered again – it needs to be perfect timing,"" she said.

The maritime archaeologist also noted that a large propeller, measuring 10.5 feet in diameter, still sits at the shipwreck site. 

Other than that, only small artifacts were found.

The find is especially remarkable because Thuss's step-grandmother garnered a reputation for finding shipwrecks herself, according to the Wisconsin Historical Society.

""'Shipwreck Suzze' Johnson, who took up the hobbies of operating a powered parachute and ultralight plane as a retiree, has incredibly discovered a variety of shipwrecks from the air in the recent past, including three shipwrecks in three days in Lake Michigan in 2015,"" the historical organization said.

The tugboat was damaged in a collision in 1889, but was repaired and had a relatively long lifespan. (Wisconsin Historical Society)

Last May, the Wisconsin Historical Society identified 11 ancient canoes in a Madison lake, including one boat that dated back to 2500 B.C.

Later that year, the organization announced the discovery of the John Evenson, a tugboat built in 1884 that was also discovered in Lake Michigan.

President Donald Trump gives an update on the 'big beautiful' budget bill as he touts early wins of his presidency.

President Donald Trump delivered a ""pep talk"" to Republicans on Capitol Hill on Tuesday in an effort to pass his ""big, beautiful bill.""

Trump's visit found House Republicans split between spending-hawk holdouts who wanted to cut more of the deficit and moderates who sought to expand tax deductions for Americans. Trump himself has pushed tax cuts and emphasized on Tuesday that he only seeks to cut ""waste, fraud and abuse"" from Medicaid.

""We're not touching anything. All I want is one thing. Three words. We don't want any waste, fraud, or abuse,"" Trump said ahead of the meeting. ""Very simple. Waste, fraud, abuse. Other than that, we're leaving it, Medicare. We're leaving it all.""

Trump was extremely complimentary of House Speaker Mike Johnson as he spoke to reporters ahead of the House Republicans' weekly meeting on the Hill. It is not clear whether Trump will meet with individual holdouts directly.

""We have a very, very united party. This man has done a fantastic job. It's only been recently, but this man has done a fantastic job. He's a real unifier,"" Trump said of Johnson, who stood beside him.

""I don't think anybody else could have done it. We had – I just said to your cohorts downstairs, we had a majority of one for a period of was and he gets it together and we actually cast this and nobody else came,"" he told reporters. ""He's done a fantastic job, the Speaker. We have a very, very unified party.""

Trump told reporters after the meeting that it had been a ""meeting of love"" and rejected reports that he is losing patience.

""I think it was really great. That was a meeting of love, let me tell you. That was love in that room. There was no shouting. I think it was a meeting of love,"" he said.

If the legislation passes through the House, it will face another – perhaps tougher – battle in the Senate, where some lawmakers have floated breaking up the bill to pass certain priorities more quickly.

Meanwhile, Democrats argue the legislation is a handout for the wealthiest Americans.

""They literally are trying to take health care away from millions of Americans at this very moment in the dead of night,"" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Monday.

""If this legislation is designed to make life better for the American people, can someone explain to me why they would hold a hearing to advance the bill at 1 a.m. in the morning?"" he added.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group, estimates that the House bill is shaping up to add roughly $3.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade.

Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani discusses President Donald Trump's ‘historic' visit to the Middle Eastern nation and more on ‘Special Report.'

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wants to put the kibosh on President Donald Trump's plan for the U.S. military to accept a Boeing airplane from Qatar to be used as Air Force One.

The Democratic lawmaker has introduced a bill that would prohibit utilizing Defense Department funding to procure, modify, restore, or maintain an aircraft for presidential flight if that aircraft was previously owned by a foreign government, foreign government-controlled entity, or foreign government representative.

""None of the funds authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2025 or fiscal year 2026 for the Department of Defense may be made available for the procurement, modification, restoration, or maintenance of an aircraft previously owned by a foreign government, an entity controlled by a foreign government, or a representative of a foreign government for the purposes of providing presidential airlift options,"" the text of the measure reads.

(Left: Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images; Right: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)

Fox News Digital reached out to the White House to request comment on Tuesday morning but did not immediately receive a response.

""Donald Trump has shown time and again – he will sell out the American people and the Presidency if it means filling his own pockets,"" Schumer said, according to a press release. 

""Not only would it take billions of taxpayer dollars to even attempt to retrofit and secure this plane, but there's absolutely no amount of modifications that can guarantee it will be secure. It is now on the Senate to prioritize our national security, protect Americans, and ensure that a foreign-owned plane never gets the call sign ‘Air Force One.'""

The proposal stands little chance of passage: Even if it were to clear both chambers of Congress where Republicans hold the majorities, the president could veto the measure, in which case passage would require enough votes to surmount a presidential veto.

""The Boeing 747 is being given to the United States Air Force/Department of Defense, NOT TO ME! It is a gift from a Nation, Qatar, that we have successfully defended for many years. It will be used by our Government as a temporary Air Force One, until such time as our new Boeings, which are very late on delivery, arrive,"" President Trump declared in a Truth Social post last week.

""Why should our military, and therefore our taxpayers, be forced to pay hundreds of millions of Dollars when they can get it for FREE from a country that wants to reward us for a job well done. This big savings will be spent, instead, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our Country. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" Trump added.

Trump indicated last week that he does not plan to fly in the plane after leaving office, but that the aircraft would be placed in his presidential library.

Robert Griffin III was among those who chimed in on the latest saga in the rivalry between basketball stars Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark, saying the Chicago Sky star ""hates Caitlin Clark.""

""After watching Caitlin Clark's flagrant foul on Angel Reese and the aftermath, there is no way Angel Reese can continue the lie that she doesn't dislike Caitlin Clark,"" Griffin wrote on X. ""I know what hatred looks like. Angel Reese HATES Caitlin Clark. Not some basketball rivalry hate either. Hate.""

Griffin later claimed his statement was ""purely based in basketball"" and was simply a ""sports take.""

Tempers flared between Reese and Clark after the Fever guard committed a flagrant foul on the Sky forward. It was one of the bigger moments of Indiana's 93-58 blowout win on Saturday. 

Current ESPN NFL analyst and former Pittsburgh Steelers star Ryan Clark reacted to Griffin's comments on the Reese-Clark drama. Clark suggested Griffin was joining the ""hate train"" and was falling in line with the positions other media figures have taken.

""When RG3 jumps onto the hate train or the angry train, it now follows what we saw from Keith Olbermann, what we saw from Dave Portnoy, as they poured onto Angel Reese to make her the villain, and Caitlin Clark heroic or hero story,"" Clark said during a recent episode of his ""The Pivot"" podcast. 

""The one thing we know about RG3 is he's not having conversations at his home about what Black women have to endure in this country. About what young Black women and athletes like Angel Reese have had to deal with being on the opposite side of Caitlin Clark's rise and ascension into stardom.""

Clark then highlighted the former NFL quarterback's marriage.

""If you're RG3, when is the last time within your household you've had a conversation about what [Angel Reese is] dealing with?"" Clark asked. ""You haven't been able to do that because in both of your marriages, you've been married to White women.""

Griffin is married to Grete Griffin, who is a native of Estonia and a heptathlete.

""You haven't had opportunities to have those conversations to educate you on what they're feeling, what Black women deal with, what they're seeing when they think of a young Angel Reese. And the whole time that he's mimicking Angel Reese and bobbing his head and moving his neck while he's doing this whole piece, his wife is in the back amening and clapping.""

Griffin left ESPN in 2024. Multiple outlets reported at the time that Griffin's dismissal was a cost-cutting move.

""When I worked with RG3, he would make all of these sort of corny jokes about milk and how much he loved it and how important it was. And he always points out on social media the color of his wife's white skin. As if the color of her skin is what makes her special. As if the color of her skin is what makes her a good wife,"" Clark continued.

""I've met the lady. I've had a conversation with her. I think she's more than that. But it also leads to what Black women deal with a lot from Black men who have chose to date or marry outside of their race. They always feel like they have to go the extra mile to prop up the woman that they married or the woman that they're with over Black women by denigrating Black women.""

Griffin caught wind of Clark's comments and took to social media to share his response.

""Ryan Clark personally attacking me and my family personally over a sports opinion is cowardly, spineless, and weak,"" Griffin wrote on X, along with a more than two-minute-long video. Griffin also stated several times that Clark's assertions were ""way out of bounds.""

Caitlin Clark and Reese have major history, going back to the 2023 NCAA women's basketball national championship. Both players downplayed the incident. 

Clark told ESPN's Holly Rowe after the third quarter that there had been ""nothing malicious"" behind the foul.

President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency this year for the northern border for human smuggling and drug trafficking. While the nearly 4,000-mile-long border with Canada gets less attention than the high-volume southern border, the boundary presents its own set of challenges. The Washington Examiner visited the northern border to evaluate how security has changed under the new administration for the series Threats from Up North: Patrolling the U.S.-Canada Border. Part 2 is on drug smuggling across the northern border.

CHAMPLAIN, New York — Drug smuggling across the U.S.-Canada border is a top concern for federal law enforcement during the Trump administration, and police officials have said their partnership with Canadian officials is reaping benefits.

President Donald Trump has spotlighted securing the northern border since he returned to office in January. The Trump administration went as far as imposing tariffs on Canada until the country took greater action to address the southbound flow of fentanyl.

Canada has worked hand-in-hand with the United States to address the flow of drugs, which the recent decline in the amount of narcotics seized at the border supports, the Washington Examiner learned from conversations with a northern border congresswoman, the Canadian border agency, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials during a ride-along in upstate New York in mid-May.

“Fentanyl across the border is coming down,” said Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-NY), whose district neighbors Canada. “I've been speaking recently with [White House border czar] Tom Homan and the Canadian government. The police up there, the Mounties, they're interested in working on and bolstering the border, and they've been investing money into making sure that we have more cooperation and it's a more secure border between the U.S. and Canada.”

Trump's Feb. 1 executive order said Canada was “failing to devote sufficient attention and resources or meaningfully coordinate with the United States law enforcement partners to effectively stem the tide of illicit drugs.”

“Despite a North American dialogue on the public health impacts of illicit drugs since 2016, Canadian officials have acknowledged that the problem has only grown,” the executive order said.

CBP is responsible for inspecting all people and goods entering the U.S. Drugs are seized in one of two places: between the ports of entry or at the ports, including from pedestrians, passenger vehicles, commercial trucks, and cargo or international mail.

Despite the northern border being twice as long with twice as many crossings as the southern border, the U.S.-Mexico border sees more pounds of drugs interdicted than the northern border. In fiscal 2025, which began last October and was last updated through April, southern border officers seized 133,000 pounds of drugs compared to 6,000 pounds up north, CBP data show for the six-month period.

During fiscal 2023, under former President Joe Biden, drug seizures were at 55,000 pounds at the northern border. The numbers have remained at historic lows under Trump.

This speaks to fewer smuggling attempts, according to Judson Murdock, acting deputy executive assistant commissioner for CBP's land ports of entry.

“I attribute that to deterrence,” Murdock said. “We are able to focus more on the threat. The cartels know that we are working with intensity, as well as the Canadians.”

In the first seven months of fiscal 2025, 7,400 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the U.S.-Mexico border, compared to 26 pounds on the Canadian border, according to CBP statistics.

Hilton Beckham, a Trump appointee who serves as CBP's assistant commissioner of public affairs, said that although fewer drugs and fentanyl are seized coming in from Canada, any amount is unacceptable given the danger it presents to Americans.

“You can't assess the threat at the Northern border simply by comparing it to the Southern border in terms of pounds seized. Just because the volume is lower doesn't mean the threat is any less serious,” Beckham said in a statement. “Even 2 milligrams of fentanyl can be lethal — and we treat every seizure, large or small, as a critical disruption to transnational criminal networks. This is a public health and public safety crisis, and we are committed to using every tool we have to confront it — on both borders.”

The majority of the drugs seized at both borders are meth, marijuana, and cocaine.

In general, cocaine and methamphetamine move north into Canada after transiting the U.S. from Mexico. Fentanyl, marijuana, and ecstasy flow south from Canada into the U.S. The same Mexican drug cartels that produce and facilitate drug smuggling are involved at the northern border, along with crime rings involved in bootlegging during Prohibition.

CBP's Detroit Field Office leads the nation in pounds of drugs seized in fiscal 2025, with cocaine making up 80% of all drugs seized.

Detroit's Ambassador Bridge is the northern border's busiest truck crossing, where drugs are often concealed in large containers coming across the border in commercial cargo.

At this bridge, drugs are not only caught flowing south into the U.S., but more drugs are caught by criminals attempting to move them north into Canada after being smuggled through the U.S. from Latin American countries, according to CBP's Detroit Port Director Marc Calixte.

“The goal is for us to disrupt, dismantle, and destroy criminal organizations. If you're crossing the port, inbound and outbound, if you are involved in narco-trafficking, if you are involved in any illegal activity, our job is to stop that,” Calixte said in an interview.

Last month, officers at the Ambassador Bridge stopped a truck carrying 339 pounds of cocaine northbound into Canada.

Calixte said it is still his officers' responsibility to stop the flow of drugs, even though it is heading out of the country.

Canada was working to stop the flow of fentanyl and synthetic opioids into the U.S. before Trump took office. It has since appointed a border czar to focus on the problem.

The Canadian government announced days before Trump took office that it had arrested more than 500 people and seized 101 pounds of fentanyl and 15,000 pills of fentanyl and other opioids, according to a statement from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Feb. 26.

The Canada Border Services Agency told the Washington Examiner that it recently concluded Operation Blizzard, a cross-country initiative to intercept illegal goods and drugs heading into and out of Canada.

CBP officials who spoke with the Washington Examiner insisted that Canada has been and continues to be a significant partner on law enforcement matters, including combating drug smuggling.

“Our information-sharing agreements with our Canadian counterparts absolutely help us protect our borders,” Murdock said.

Trump's targeting of Canada for new tariffs and citing fentanyl trafficking as the rationale drew bipartisan skepticism, particularly given the unaddressed demand side of the epidemic.

Senate Democrats and even several Republicans have come to Canada's defense and knocked the Trump administration for going after it so severely, given the long history of cooperation.

Simon Hankinson, senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation's Border Security and Immigration Center in Washington, D.C., maintained that there is a growing problem in Canada.

“I have spoken to Canadian officials recently a few times, and they seem to think they are making progress. But there are a lot of labs making drugs, and more ready-made fentanyl coming into Canada and being consumed locally or shipped south to us via trucks,” Hankinson said in a March email.

The Trump administration's ability to clamp down on fentanyl and other drugs coming over the southern border has put more pressure on Mexican drug cartels to find other ways to get narcotics into the U.S.

A May report by the Drug Enforcement Administration concluded that “super laboratories” for fentanyl production were recently uncovered in Canada, drawing more concern about how cartels may be planning to move their product into the U.S.

A spokesman for the Canadian border agency maintained that Canada was funding its border security plan and would work closely with the U.S. to safeguard both countries' interests.

“We have a strong border, and we are making it stronger,” a CBSA spokesman said. “Canada's Border Plan is backed by an investment of $1.3 billion to bolster border security, strengthen our immigration system, and contribute to Canada's prosperity.”

Tenney said Trump's focus on the matter already had a positive effect deterring crime rings at the border, but that it would continue to be met with enhanced cooperation from Canada.

“The level they're interested in investing, from what I've heard, is going to be significant, and that will, you know, be a very big bonus to us on the northern border, and really limit the kinds of fentanyl, and other illicit drugs that are coming across the border,” Tenney said.

President Donald Trump warned House Republicans about spending negotiations, using profanity to emphasize his warning against Medicaid cuts.

Trump spoke at the weekly House Republican meeting on Tuesday to urge hard-line holdouts to back his “big, beautiful bill,” currently the subject of a tug-of-war between conservative fiscal hawks and anxious centrists in vulnerable districts. The president's patience was wearing thin at the meeting, with a House GOP source and White House official telling the Washington Examiner that he demanded the caucus stop bickering over details and push the bill through.

His biggest concern was changes to Medicaid, which he issued a stark warning to avoid.

“Don't f*** around with Medicaid,” he told House Republicans.

Trump told the caucus the only changes to Medicaid could be eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse, kicking illegal immigrants off, and implementing commonsense work requirements. He urged them not to let state and local tax deduction impede the bill, arguing that they could fight for it later on.

The president clarified he was losing patience with holdouts and stressed that he wanted every Republican to vote “yes” on the bill.

His last demand already appears to be falling short. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris (R-MA) told the Washington Examiner that he was still a “no” and believes enough other Republicans are noes to prevent the bill from passing.

“We're still a long ways away, but we can get there — maybe not by tomorrow,” Harris said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt elaborated on Trump's position regarding Medicaid at a Monday press conference, saying he wants to protect Medicaid for the “most vulnerable” while ensuring all able-bodied citizens still work.

“The president wants to preserve and protect Medicaid for Americans who this program was intended for, the most vulnerable in our society — pregnant women, low-income families, seniors, those who truly need these benefits — and it should be going to people who physically cannot work,” she said.

Trump would like “to see able-bodied Americans at least working 20 hours per week, whether that's part time or full time.”

“Whether that's even looking for work or volunteering for 20 hours a week, if they are receiving Medicaid,” Leavitt added. “These are commonsense reforms to ensure those that this program was intended for receive those benefits.”

The delayed implementation of certain provisions of the megabill, specifically regarding Medicaid, has angered some Republican fiscal hawks.

The new bill seeks to implement the fiscal plan's perks now while pushing back the downsides, delaying work requirements and verification rules to 2029, when Trump will have concluded his second term. The provisions have put the bill at risk, with some in the Republicans' thin majority signaling they won't vote it through.

TRUMP SAYS AFTER 2020 LOSS, HE THOUGHT ‘I'LL RUN AGAIN AND SHOVE IT UP THEIR A**'

Trump has been more liberal with profanities to get his point across recently — he also swore at a dinner at the White House with the Kennedy Center Board on Monday. He began riffing during his speech and recalled that during his first term, he bemoaned the fact that the Olympics and World Cup would be hosted in the United States in 2028 and 2026, respectively, which he thought he wouldn't be able to preside over due to being termed out in 2024 — before losing his first reelection bid.

“And then they rigged the election, and then I said, ‘You know what I'll do? I'll run again, and I'll shove it up their a**,'” he said, triggering laughter and applause from the audience.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The ambitious deadline set by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) to pass the “one big, beautiful” reconciliation bill by Memorial Day is up against the reality that House Republicans haven't locked in the votes.

President Donald Trump, who has already bashed “grandstanders” holding up the bill, will head to Capitol Hill on Tuesday morning to speak at the House Republicans' weekly conference meeting, a sign that leadership is putting pressure on holdouts. After meeting with the whole conference, the White House staff is reportedly holding meetings with holdouts on Capitol Hill. 

The tax cut legislation hinges on votes from fiscal hawks and the SALT Caucus, who want changes on key provisions before backing the marquee GOP legislation.

With just three votes to spare in his slim Republican majority, Johnson has little time to get the reconciliation legislation on the floor for a House-wide vote by Thursday or Wednesday at the earliest. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act calls for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset extending Trump's 2017 tax breaks.  

Though 95% of the bill is done and ready for a full House vote, Republican leadership staff told reporters on Monday morning that there are still “ongoing conversations” about the remaining 5%, which includes raising the state and local tax (SALT) cap, Medicaid work requirements, and repealing portions of the Inflation Reduction Act.

The Rules Committee is scheduled to meet at 1 a.m. on Wednesday to discuss alterations to the legislation, the product of a handshake agreement between leadership and fiscal hawks to pass the bill of the Budget Committee on Sunday.

“We're almost there, and I'm very optimistic that we will find the right equilibrium point to get this bill delivered,” Johnson said on Monday afternoon. “It's going to be a big thing for the country.”

GOP leadership aides did not provide any specific details as to what was in the handshake agreement, but Reps. Chip Roy (R-TX) and Ralph Norman (R-SC) said on Sunday night that they had made progress with moving up both the effective date of the Medicaid work requirements and the date of repeal of several IRA clean energy tax credits. 

Originally, the work requirements were set to kick in 2029, though Johnson said there is broad support from most of the GOP to move up the start date; it's just a matter of feasibility. Aides characterized the fight over Medicaid as “push and pull conversations.”  

In the manager's amendment, which allows for alterations to the reconciliation bill, the new effective date for Medicaid work requirements is December 2026.

“I think it's the desire of every Republican, always has been, to make work requirements real and actionable as soon as possible,” the speaker said Sunday. “We learned in the process that some of the states needed a longer lag time to add in the implementation of the new policy. So we're going to … make it happen sooner, as soon as possible. And I think that's a good change in the policy.”

SALT Republicans are also holding up the process, as they want to see the cap raised from the proposed increase to $30,000. Johnson was optimistic last week that they would be able to reach an agreement on SALT over the weekend, but GOP leadership aides said Monday that there are still “unsolved issues” to iron out.

The SALT caucus met with leadership at 9 p.m. on Monday, with Rep. Nick LaLota (R-NY) telling reporters he was hoping to be presented with a deal he could accept. The proposed $40,000/$80,000 caps for single and married filers were a nonstarter, as LaLota called the sunset in a few years to the current $10,000 cap a “poison pill.”

The New York Republican expressed disappointment with the close crunch time.

“I would've preferred that we'd handled this two months ago … This was on everyone's radar for a couple of years now,” LaLota said. “That it's coming down to the last minute is unfortunate, but I think we'll get through it.” 

Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY), another SALT Republican, agreed that the debate over SALT should have “been dealt with months ago.” He said it “certainly appears” that leadership took the SALT Republicans for granted and “that they felt they could just jam us.”

Lawler also scoffed at Freedom Caucus members who have said the SALT caucus is asking for too much, stating, “Good luck getting what they want.”

“We wouldn't even be in this position right now if you didn't have members in seats like mine, who won,” Lawler said. “And so if they think we're going to throw our constituents under the bus to appease them, it's not happening.”

There are also mixed discussions on adjustments to the federal-state cost-sharing of Medicaid, or FMAP, with lawmakers going back and forth about whether it's on the table. Norman said he's been discussing potential changes to FMAP with Johnson, an issue the speaker had said was off the table.

But LaLota told reporters that centrist Republicans in the Problem Solvers Caucus expressed to Johnson during a Monday meeting that fiscal hawks' push to limit federal dollars to state-run Medicaid programs is “a difficult pill for us all to swallow.”

“We want to know what's truly on the table, what's not, because that affects us in our district,” LaLota said. “It sounds like it's off the table, but yet I hear a couple of my colleagues still talking as if it's on the table. We'd prefer it to be off the table.”

Roy said he thinks the Rules Committee should delay the 1 a.m. Wednesday vote and he's “skeptical” of pushing the legislation through, especially without a “more thorough process.” He said he's been told numerous times that there will be “plenty of time to negotiate.”

“We made enough progress that we thought in good faith, we should move it forward,” Roy said of the legislation advancing out of the Budget Committee on Sunday. “But let's be clear, there are still very strong outstanding questions, and I think there are people across the entire conference who recognize that, and it is a mistake for this important of a policy to jam it through.”

Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD), Freedom Caucus chairman, said, “I think it's pretty obvious that we think we need more time,” calling the discussions “complicated.”

When asked if leadership should delay the Rules vote, Lawler said they had “better have a good number tonight.” 

Norman told reporters he'd vote for the bill out of the Rules Committee regardless of whether he personally likes the bill.

“The body has a right to vote on it,” Norman added.

Meanwhile, Johnson is moving full speed ahead. In an unrelated Rules Committee meeting on Monday night, the House approved a same-day authority that allows the reconciliation package to hit the floor as soon as Wednesday. A whip notice to lawmakers, obtained by the Washington Examiner, notes that an additional vote session could be added on Wednesday should Johnson call for a vote on the budget legislation.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that “it's essential that every Republican in the House and the Senate unite behind President Trump and pass this popular and essential legislative package.”

“It represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver on the Make America Great Again agenda responsible for President Trump's landslide victory on Nov. 5,” she said. “The America First policies in this bill are the reason why Republicans currently have the majority in Congress right now.”

Not all Republicans' votes are dependent on Trump's remarks at the conference meeting. Harris told reporters that he's “just not sure there's anything the president can tell me tomorrow that would change my mind at this point. I'm a hard no on it.”

When asked what he would say if Trump called him and asked him to vote yes, Harris said he would convince the president that “this moment in history is when he reverses the spending trajectory of the country, which he has run on.”

“He said he wants to solve the budget deficit,” Harris said. “I would make the case that this big, beautiful bill could get more beautiful with a little more work.”

The math is tough for Johnson. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who frequently detracts from his party over spending, is likely to be one of the three “no” votes Johnson can afford. Eyes will be on Roy and Norman, as well as Freedom Caucus members and like-minded lawmakers such as Reps. Victoria Spartz (R-IN) and Tim Burchett (R-TN), to see whether they will be swayed to vote in favor of the bill.

The speaker will not receive any help from Democrats. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) blasted the GOP for holding a 1 a.m. hearing on the reconciliation bill, accusing Republicans of wanting to “hide what's in it.”

REPUBLICANS MUSCLE THE ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' OUT OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE 

“If this legislation is designed to make life better for the American people, can someone explain to me why they would hold a hearing to advance the bill at 1 a.m. in the morning?” Jeffries asked.

“House Republicans, in particular, are once again shamefully bending the knee and serving as nothing more than a rubber stamp for Donald Trump's extreme agenda,” he added. “That's why he's coming up to the Hill tomorrow, to give them their marching orders.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) made accusations on Sunday that the Trump administration and budget cuts initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency contributed to the Mexican navy training ship that crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge, which killed two people and injured 20. 

“With the Brooklyn Bridge strike last night, I'm fighting for answers about whether Trump and DOGE have impacted water traffic control,” Schumer said. “We know they've been meddling with U.S. Coast Guard staffing. Trump relieved Admiral Linda Fagan as Commandant of the USCG, and that position is still vacant.”

With the Brooklyn Bridge strike last night:I'm fighting for answers about whether Trump and DOGE have impacted water traffic control.We know they've been meddling with U.S. Coast Guard staffing.Trump relieved Admiral Linda Fagan as Commandant of the USCG, and that position…

“And the hiring freeze has limited the ability for the USCG to staff up the Vehicle Traffic Service, that's their traffic control operation that acts like Air Traffic Control but on water,” Schumer added. “We need action for our national security, infrastructure protection, and public safety.”

Schumer never provided any proof to support his accusation. On Monday, the U.S. Coast Guard rejected the senator's accusation, explaining that its traffic service system was fully operational. 

“The U.S. Coast Guard's New York Vessel Traffic Service was fully functional during the incident, operating in accordance with established procedures to manage commercial traffic and facilitate safe navigation,” a spokesperson from the Coast Guard said.

“Our response included launching a crew from Station New York, establishing a temporary safety zone, and coordinating with NYPD, FDNY, and NYC DOT,” the spokesperson added.

The Coast Guard is the second federal agency in as many days to refute Schumer's claims about the tragic accident. On Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security denied the New York senator's assertions and scolded him for making such an accusation. 

DHS REBUKES SCHUMER OVER COMMENTS ABOUT MEXICAN NAVY SHIP CRASH

“Minority Leader Schumer's accusations that a hiring freeze led to the U.S. Coast Guard's Vessel Traffic Services not being adequately staffed are FALSE,” the DHS wrote on X. “The US Coast Guard has been fully supported and been exempt from hiring freezes. Additionally, this incident had nothing to do with Vessel Traffic Services — when a ship loses propulsion in a high current area, the vessel needs to engage all capabilities to stop and ideally tugs are nearby to support.”

“We encourage Minority Leader Schumer to get his facts straight before he misleads the American people,” the DHS added.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Former President Joe Biden‘s aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis has thrown a wrench in Democrats' plans to move beyond his presidency and 2024 campaign.

Biden's cancer diagnosis arrived amid heightened scrutiny of his cognitive health. The book Original Sin, set for release on Tuesday, details episodes of forgetfulness during Biden's presidency and alleges that his aides sought to conceal these problems. 

A comprehensive five-hour, 10-minute audio recording from a special counsel's October 2023 interview with Biden was obtained and released by Axios, in which his struggle to recall critical details, such as the year he left the vice presidency and the date of his son's passing, sparked renewed concerns about his cognitive condition.

Debate over Biden's mental fitness during his presidency divided Democrats, with some defending him while others accused his team of concealing his deficits to avoid a primary challenge.

Biden, 82, initially pursued a second term but withdrew in favor of former Vice President Kamala Harris following a faltering debate performance in late June that exposed his cognitive struggles.

Democratic strategist Jon Reinish acknowledged there is no evidence of a cover-up regarding the former president's diagnosis but noted that the Bidens' existing trust deficit, even among Democrats, has fueled skepticism and allowed conspiracy theories to take hold.

“In having that trust deficit, it automatically allows and gives room. It gives permission for other theories to jump in. So in that way, it's an unfortunate factor here,” Reinish said. “While people are compassionate, there's less of a bulwark of unhesitating goodwill. You know, people are angry at the Bidens. Democrats are angry at the Bidens. So, it is a tough thing to have to acknowledge.”

Biden is hardly the first president to face scrutiny over his health. Franklin D. Roosevelt concealed the effects of polio, Dwight D. Eisenhower downplayed a heart attack and stroke, and Woodrow Wilson's debilitating stroke was kept largely hidden from the public. John F. Kennedy secretly battled Addison's disease, and Ronald Reagan showed early signs of Alzheimer's that were never disclosed while he was in office.

That long-standing pattern of secrecy around the health of top officials resurfaced in early 2024, when former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin faced backlash for failing to disclose promptly his hospitalization for complications following prostate cancer surgery. The lack of transparency, even from top White House officials, sparked bipartisan criticism and raised concerns about accountability and communication at the highest levels of national security.

Michael LaRosa, who once worked as former first lady Jill Biden's press secretary, argued that Democrats must rebuild trust by openly admitting they were wrong to support Biden's reelection without questioning his fitness.

“We should have been asking more questions, we should have been more observant, and no, of course, he should not have run for president,” LaRosa said, speaking to the Washington Examiner. 

“No more dodging and robotic talking points that deflect from responsibility. [Democrats] have to just take responsibility and do it as fast as possible and get it over with, but do it in a matter that they can be consistent from now going forward because the ‘we're moving forward thing' does not cut it, doesn't cut it, and it won't cut it,” he said. 

“Voters forgive a lot of things, but they don't forgive phonies,” he added.

Republicans have been quick to revive the conversation around Biden. During his flight from Rome to Washington on Monday, Vice President JD Vance expressed well wishes for the former president but also urged a closer examination of his cognitive performance while in office.

“We really do need to be honest about whether the former president was capable of doing the job,” Vance said. “In some ways, I blame him less than I blame the people around him.”

The vice president raised concerns that doctors or White House aides may have deliberately concealed information about Biden's fitness for office from the public.

“Why didn't the American people have a better sense of his health picture? Why didn't the American people have more accurate information about what he was actually dealing with? This is serious stuff,” Vance said.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) criticized Republicans for spreading conspiracy theories and shifting focus away from current healthcare matters.

“It seems to me entirely inappropriate that at this moment in time when President Biden is dealing with a serious and aggressive form of cancer, there are Republicans who are peddling conspiracy theories and want us to look backward at a time when they actually are taking healthcare away from the American people,” Jeffries said on Monday. 

Jennifer Holdsworth, a Democratic strategist who managed former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg's bid for DNC chair, argued that raising doubts about Biden's cognitive state after his cancer diagnosis is inappropriate.

“I think it's craven and heartless to talk about anything else when anyone on planet Earth announces they have cancer,” Holdsworth told the Washington Examiner. “Democrats are all over the map on their thoughts regarding whether President Biden should have announced for reelection or not. But most of this narrative that is being spun is just another MAGA fever dream.”

The diagnosis has cast criticism of Biden's role in the party's 2024 defeat as insensitive, temporarily halting efforts by younger Democrats to address the matter with greater candor. 

“Unfortunately, I think it will lead to further speculation. I wish people could take a moment and focus on the impact of this on the former president and his family,” said Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist. “But, given the age we live in, there are all sorts of speculation … It's in poor taste to speculate on the nature of this illness and the history of the cancer without any medical expertise.”

Discussions regarding Biden's cognitive abilities during his tenure have created challenging questions for potential Democratic contenders in the 2028 presidential race. The matter is particularly sensitive for Harris and Buttigieg, who served in his administration.

Bannon said he believes Biden's top Cabinet-level officials will face further scrutiny for what they knew about his health struggles. 

“The new books coming out raise serious questions about what they knew and when they knew it. It's pretty clear he was in decline, and any attempt they may have made to hide his condition was not in the best service of the Democratic Party or the United States of America,” he said.

Reinish pointed out that with so many contenders likely in 2028, those who avoid getting tangled up in questions about Biden's health will have a clearer path, while others could face a tough uphill battle answering tough questions right out of the gate.

“I think that the less baggage you have, the better off you will be, because what you don't want to do is to start to tour the country and start to form an exploratory committee … and then you're bogged down with being asked what did you know and when did you know it around Joe Biden and his condition,” Reinish asked rhetorically. “Certain people will have to get through that baggage, but certain others won't.”

However, Holdsworth said she is confident that concerns over Biden's health will fade well before the 2028 race takes shape.

“I think, given the crisis-a-minute that is coming out of the Trump White House, we will be around the bend by the time 2028 discussions come into focus,” she said.

BIDEN DIAGNOSED WITH ‘AGGRESSIVE FORM' OF PROSTATE CANCER THAT HAS SPREAD TO HIS BONES

Democratic strategists are urging the party to focus on future priorities and concentrate their efforts on challenging Trump.

“The biggest issue is that the nation's economic problems have intensified since Donald Trump became president,” Bannon said. “Inflation is still rising; it rose again in April, and the Democrats have to make sure Trump answers for the problems he has created in the economy.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Many Democrats are saying now is not the time to discuss former President Joe Biden's health while in office in the wake of his prostate cancer diagnosis.

The news that Biden is suffering from an aggressive form of cancer that has already spread to his bones came as yet another book about his condition as president hit the shelves, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again by Jake Tapper of CNN and Alex Thompson of Axios.

Top Democratic strategist David Axelrod said “conversations” about Biden's health and mental acuity as president “should be more muted and set aside for now as he's struggling through this.”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) was more pointed in his response to whether Biden's cancer diagnosis raised new questions about his ability to serve or transparency regarding the former president's medical condition.

“It seems to me entirely inappropriate that at this moment in time when President Biden is dealing with a serious and aggressive form of cancer, there are Republicans who are peddling conspiracy theories and want us to look backward at a time when they actually are taking health care away from the American people,” Jeffries told reporters. 

“Maybe let's not play partisan games with a cancer diagnosis, okay?” posted Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist and former Vice President Kamala Harris‘s adviser, in response to those wondering if Biden's latest health scare was similar in nature to what has been reported in books such as Original Sin.

When Vice President JD Vance wished Biden well but questioned whether this was another example of the former president's health receiving insufficient scrutiny, Politico's Jonathan Martin described it as “a real-time depiction of somebody struggling between the responsibilities of high office and the temptations that come with being totally online.”    

President Donald Trump has also called Biden's diagnosis “very sad” while expressing skepticism about the timeline. 

It is possible that Biden's prostate cancer is wholly unrelated to the problems that led voters to increasingly question his ability to continue as president as his term wore on, with Democrats nudging him aside after he struggled in a presidential debate with Trump on June 27, 2024.

But knowing what we know now about the extent of Biden's age-related decline and his team's efforts to conceal it from the public, questions about this sudden diagnosis of an advanced cancer that apparently went undetected while in office seem valid.

The dismissal of all Biden age-related questions as partisan talking points or conservative disinformation was a big part of why the media got the story so wrong, and many Democrats were caught flatfooted by his debate performance. 

If Democratic elites had listened to their party's rank-and-file voters, who told pollsters they wanted another option in 2024, they would not have been sent scrambling in the weeks following that debate. If journalists had not been so eager to accept the “cheap fakes” explanation for video footage of seemingly bad Biden outings, they wouldn't be writing mea culpas about their Biden age and health coverage months after he left office.

The new Biden books aren't being written by conservatives or partisan Republicans. Before Tapper and Thompson, one came from Tyler Pager of the New York Times, Josh Dawsey of the Wall Street Journal, and Isaac Arnsdorf of the Washington Post. It's also a big part of another book written by Jonathan Allen of NBC News and Amie Parnes of the Hill.

Some of these books are even sympathetic to Democratic political interests. For whom was Biden's decision to seek reelection “disastrous,” if not the Democrats?

The latest devastating health news for Biden should be handled sensitively and compassionately. People should fervently hope he makes a full recovery.

But if the point of all fresh reporting on Biden is to help learn from past mistakes, the answer cannot be to ignore new questions or change the subject. 

“Whether the right time to have this conversation is now or at some point in the future,” is how Vance prefaced his comments to reporters.

WHO WAS FOOLED BY THE BIDEN DECLINE COVER-UP? NOT THE VOTERS 

“We really do need to be honest about whether the former president was capable of doing the job,” he said.

Hopefully, that conversation will happen before new books lamenting old Biden coverage decisions are published years from now.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Trump Thinks He Knows What Started the Pandemic","https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2025/05/lab-leak-pandemic-trump-maga/682854/","Tue, 20 May 2025 16:05:00 GMT","

The lab-leak theory of COVID-19's origins has become a principle of MAGA governance.

The lab-leak theory of COVID-19's origins comes in many forms. Here is Donald Trump's: A scientist in Wuhan walked outside to have lunch, maybe with a girlfriend or something. “That's how it leaked out in my opinion, and I've never changed that opinion,” the president said earlier this month at a press event. Whether something like this really happened was, until this year, a subject of lively debate. These days, it's being presented as official history. Yes, COVID did come out of a Chinese lab, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters shortly after Trump's inauguration. “We now know that to be the confirmable truth.”

Of course, we don't really know that, and they don't know it either. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who has convened yet another lab-leak investigation at Trump's behest (after many other intelligence assessments led to split results), could only dance around the matter in an interview with Megyn Kelly earlier this month. Has some new and final proof been found? Kelly asked. Gabbard responded: “We are working on that with Jay Bhattacharya,” the director of the National Institutes of Health, “and look forward to being able to share that hopefully very soon.” (Gabbard's office did not reply to a request for comment.)

Any hedging on the matter of pandemic origins represents a standard view among the experts: We simply aren't sure. In reporting on this question for the past few years, I've spoken with some scientists and pandemic-origins investigators who are confident the coronavirus came out of a Wuhan lab, and with some who say they're nearly certain that the virus spread to humans from a market stall. I've also heard from many others whose appraisals of the odds fall somewhere in between. Their only common ground may be the single plain acknowledgment that the evidence we have is incomplete.

But, despite the well-established data gaps—and in willful disregard of them—the lab-leak theory has become a MAGA theorem. Adherence to it is now a central tenet of the Trump administration: a shibboleth for loyalists, an animating grievance, and, in recent weeks, a stated rationale for punitive reforms. Earlier this month, when the White House proposed an $18 billion cut to the nation's budget for biomedical research, the lab-leak theory—described as “now confirmed”—was given as a pretext.

There are many reasons to regret this shift toward artificial certainty, starting with the fact that whatever nuance now attached to the topic of pandemic origins has been hard-won. For much of 2020, a different bullheadedness prevailed: Invocations of the lab-leak theory were often tarred as right-wing propaganda, or even racist lies. At the start of Joe Biden's presidency, “there was a clear and almost overwhelming leaning towards natural origin,” David Relman, a Stanford microbiologist and former member of the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity who has long maintained that a laboratory origin is more likely, told me. This bias weakened over time, as the theory came to have more distance from the Trump administration, and more suggestive bits of circumstantial evidence accrued. In the spring of 2023, the COVID-19 Origin Act, which demanded the declassification of all lab-leak-related intelligence, passed without a wisp of opposition, and in 2024, Relman himself was detailed to the White House as a senior adviser working on pandemic preparedness. “There was a palpable shift to the middle,” he said.

But this equanimity has proved to be short-lived. According to the new administration and its supporters, the laboratory origin is presumptively correct. On covid.gov, which until last month offered only basic patient information (“If you test positive for COVID-19, talk to a doctor as soon as possible”), LAB LEAK now appears in jumbo font across the top—with Trump himself emerging from the gap between the B and L, as if he'd just leaked out himself. “The true origins of COVID-19,” the government website says, beside his foot.

Declaring fealty to this point of view has now become a sacred rite within the GOP, not unlike endorsement of the claim that the 2020 election was a fraud. Plenty of Trump's most senior appointees have averred that COVID started in a lab. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem described it as “the truth.” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has claimed that a laboratory origin is a “no-brainer,” and described it falsely as “now the leading theory among scientists.” Bhattacharya said at an NIH town hall on Monday that he believes the coronavirus was released from a lab, and that it derived from U.S.-funded research. The DHS, FDA, and NIH did not reply to requests for comment.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has staked out the most extreme position of the bunch, publicly declaring that “SARS CoV-2 is certainly the product of bioweapons research.” As of January, the entire U.S. intelligence community disagreed with this assessment. In an email, an HHS spokesperson told me that Americans “will no longer accept silence, censorship, or scientific groupthink” and “deserve the truth.”

In the background, too, the administration has looked to bring other hard-liners on the lab-leak theory into the fold. Robert Kadlec, for instance, has been nominated for a role at the Department of Defense. A veteran of the first Trump administration who was instrumental in the management of Operation Warp Speed, he is also the author of a report that argues SARS-CoV-2 might have been developed by the Chinese military as a bioweapon that could lower American IQs by fogging up our brains with long COVID. (Kadlec told me that he doesn't think COVID would be a major part of his portfolio, if he were confirmed—but “it will have relevance with the biosurveillance work that may be done,” he said.)

A former senior scientist at NIH told me about two others whose potential roles in government have not previously been reported. The first is Alina Chan, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the author of Viral: The Search for the Origin of COVID-19, and a dogged advocate for more vigorous investigations of the lab-leak theory and tighter restrictions on virology research. Chan confirmed to me that she is in discussions for a role at the NIH. “I haven't committed to anything,” she told me, “but I do feel like now that we've reached this point, I feel that this is probably the most important thing that I should be doing in my life—doing as much as I can to help the U.S. government prevent future catastrophic lab leaks.”

The former NIH scientist, who requested anonymity in order to preserve professional relationships, also said a contract was under consideration for Bryce Nickels, a Rutgers geneticist and Bhattacharya's friend and former podcast co-host. Nickels has been notably aggressive on the lab-leak theory, and as an advocate for better oversight of research that could lead to the production of more dangerous pathogens. In his posts on social media, Nickels has called Anthony Fauci a “monster” and maintained that the U.S. is in the business of developing “bioweapon agents.” (Nickels did not reply to questions for this article.)

In principle, the arrival of this lab-leak coterie in Washington could have marked a useful shift in the study of pandemic origins. If the old guard in public health was at times inclined to paper over uncomfortable debates, this new one might be zealously transparent. Chan, for instance, told me that she'd like to see investigators take a closer look at documents and correspondence from EcoHealth Alliance, the NIH-funded nonprofit that was working with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and spend more effort trying to nail down the very first cases of disease in China. She also thinks the government should release more details of the intelligence community's assessments, which might explain why different agencies and offices have come to different answers as to what is most likely to have occurred. (The FBI, CIA, and Department of Energy lean toward a laboratory accident of some kind. Five others, including the National Intelligence Council and the Defense Intelligence Agency, are inclined the other way.)

But this administration seems unlikely to make much progress on this front. If anything, its policies and proclamations have only made the subject more intractable. Even before Trump took office, many scientists were reluctant to engage with the topic, for fear of being drawn into what has been a very public and vituperative debate. Now that worry must be multiplied a hundred times. In recent months, the NIH has terminated grants that run afoul of the government's positions on diversity and gender, and shut off funding to entire research universities. It will soon end the system that U.S. researchers use to share grant funding with foreign collaborators, and has begun suspending collaborations overseas. The risks of stepping out of line have never been so salient.

In the meantime, new government restrictions inspired by the lab-leak theory could serve to make it even harder to fill in the remaining details of what happened in Wuhan. Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona who has published a string of papers laying out an aggressive case for the market origin, told me that he'd like to see more sampled DNA from wild populations of civets, raccoon dogs, and bamboo rats throughout China. But this sort of work would require close collaboration with Chinese researchers, at just the time when those collaborations are being scrutinized or canceled.

“The administration is developing a very adversarial relationship with the scientific and technical communities,” Filippa Lentzos, a biosecurity researcher and professor at King's College London, told me. “It's not a facts-based discussion. There are facts from one side, but not from the other side.” This climate will tend to undermine the work of encouraging more prudence in the labs of those who study risky pathogens, she said. As for the COVID-origins debate itself, she does not expect a satisfying answer. “I think it's kind of a lost cause.”

Either way, by tying budget cuts and other new restrictions to the lab-leak theory, the administration seems intent on punishing an enormous swath of biomedical researchers for the actions of the tiny handful whose work could even theoretically be tied to the pandemic. “This is the most enormous case of baby and bathwater that I have ever seen,” Relman told me. “The baby is just being shoved down the drain.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

While many Democrats remained in denial, Mike Quigley perceived something painfully familiar.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

Midway through President Joe Biden's four-day trip to Ireland in April 2023, Representative Mike Quigley of Illinois realized whom the president reminded him of and why.

The proudly Irish president was in great spirits, energized by the crowds. In Ballina, he delivered a speech to one of the biggest audiences of his political career. Standing in front of Saint Muredach's Cathedral, the president recalled that 27,000 of the bricks used in its construction were provided in 1828 by his great-great-great-grandfather, Edward Blewitt, for £21 and 12 shillings.

“I was able to hold one of them in my hand today,” the president said. “They're damn heavy.” The crowd laughed.

It was a homecoming in many ways. The president had brought with him his sister, Valerie, and son Hunter. They went to see a memorial plaque to Beau Biden at the Mayo Roscommon Hospice. One of the priests at the Knock Shrine turned out to have given Beau last rites in 2015, a revelation that brought the president to tears. In a speech to the joint houses of the Irish Parliament, the president said it was Beau who “should be the one standing here giving this speech to you.”

Read: Biden the sinner

In Dublin on Thursday, April 13, Biden was welcomed to Áras an Uachtaráin, the official residence of the president of Ireland. The busy schedule included a tree-planting ceremony, a ringing of the Peace Bell, and an honor guard presenting arms.

At one point, the room Biden was in emptied out and fewer than a dozen people were left—including Quigley and his friend Brian Higgins, then a congressman representing New York. Hunter took advantage of the lull to impress upon his father the need to rest.

“You promised you wouldn't do this,” Hunter said. “You promised you'd take a nap. You know you can't handle all this.”

The president waved off his son and walked over to the bar in the back of the room, where a lone woman was working. She served him a soft drink. He seemed utterly sapped and not quite there.

And that was when Quigley realized why the scene felt so familiar: The president's behavior reminded him of his father's in his final years; he had died of Parkinson's in 2019, at the age of 92.

Some Democrats, perhaps chief among them the former president himself, still deny that his very real deterioration happened. On The View earlier this month, the co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin, referring primarily to our forthcoming book, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, asked the former president about the “Democratic sources” who “claim in your final year, there was a dramatic decline in your cognitive abilities. What is your response to these allegations, and are these sources wrong?”

“They are wrong. There's nothing to sustain that,” Biden said.

For our book, we spoke with more than 200 people, overwhelmingly Democrats, many of whom worked passionately to pass Biden's agenda. They included Cabinet secretaries, administration officials, and members of Congress.

Almost all of them would talk with us only after the election, and they told their stories in sadness and good faith.

People such as Mike Quigley.

Quigley's father, Bill, was abandoned as an infant at an Indiana orphanage, then adopted by a World War I veteran and his wife. The application form asked what gender child they preferred to adopt. “Any child we can love,” they wrote. Bill took his dad's name and, when he was old enough, worked with him on farms as a handyman. Drafted into the Army during the Korean War, Bill became a member of the Signal Corps, learning skills that would get him a postwar job at AT&T for 35 years. Bill never finished college, but he worked hard and built a loving middle-class life for his family. He was his son Mike's hero.

Bill's last years were tough. Parkinson's is a brutal disease. Because he lived in a small town, his problems were initially misdiagnosed, but the deterioration was unmistakable, and it was difficult on the entire family. When everyone showed up at family functions, Bill would get an adrenaline boost. When the high wore off, though, it was akin to witnessing all the air empty from a balloon. For Mike, watching his father deflated and drained was heartbreaking.

From the January/February 2020 issue: What Joe Biden can't bring himself to say

And as he watched Biden during that April 2023 trip, Mike Quigley thought it all looked very familiar. The president hadn't yet officially announced that he was running for reelection, though it was expected. How can he do this? Quigley asked himself.

The president gained strength from the adoring Irish crowds. And away from them, he seemed as if all the life had left him.

Biden, Quigley thought to himself, needed to go to bed for the rest of the day and night. He wasn't merely physically frail; he had lost almost all of his energy. His speech behind the scenes was breathless, soft, weak. There was so much about the president on this trip that reminded Quigley of his dad.

Quigley told Brian Higgins how much the president's symptoms seemed Parkinsonian. But Higgins had his own frame of reference. He had lost his father to Alzheimer's and thought he was noticing something familiar in the president's shuffling.

“A diagnosis is nothing more than pattern recognition,” Higgins would later tell us. “When people see that stuff, it conjures up a view that there's something going on neurologically.”

Helen Lewis: Biden's age is now unavoidable

The president's deterioration became pronounced in 2023, the year of the Ireland trip.

Quietly, Democratic officials were beginning to wonder whether the president was in cognitive decline—“which was evident to most people that watched him,” Higgins said.

After all, the fate of the nation depended on Biden's ability to mount a strong reelection campaign.

On the floor of the House and in caucus meetings throughout 2023 and early 2024, House Democrats who had witnessed such moments—although only a few, because access to Biden was so limited—talked about what they'd seen and what they could do.

Quigley wondered why the White House physician didn't pursue a diagnosis to see what was wrong with the president—but, he figured, perhaps Biden's staff simply didn't want to know.

He also felt as if he had no good options. He could talk about what he'd seen, he could lament it, but he and other Democrats asked one another: What the hell could they actually achieve? At the end of the day, all they would likely accomplish would be angering the president.

In 2023, with Donald Trump facing fierce legal headwinds and strong GOP challengers—Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis—some Democrats' concerns about Biden's decline were tempered by their erroneous belief that Trump couldn't win, which lowered the stakes.

The consensus among these Democrats was that going public with their concerns would serve only to get them in a lot of trouble. Biden was going to be the nominee—no one serious was challenging him in the primaries—so why would they want to draw attention to his decline?

Their concerns about Biden were not the stuff of right-wing conspiracists. They were worried because people they loved had fallen victim to some of the cruelties that time delivers. And frankly, they were late to the realization. The American people had been expressing serious concerns about Biden's abilities, because of his age, for years.

Concerns over the age of presidential hopefuls weren't even specific to Biden.

In 1991, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee from the previous election, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, hired a young pollster named Geoff Garin to secretly explore the prospect of Bentsen running for president the next year.

Garin ran the numbers and came back to the Texan with bad news: Voters thought that the senator, at age 70, was simply too old.

More than 30 years later, Garin did polling for Biden and saw much the same result. In a way, the argument was irrefutable. The American people might have been confused about tariffs, unsure of how to tackle the deficit, and uncertain how to handle the challenges of the migrant crisis, but they understood what aging does. They had seen their grandparents and parents go through it. And they did not want a president navigating those challenges.

In October 2022, one of us, Jake, got a chance to interview Biden, his last such opportunity. Biden was not the man Jake had interviewed in September 2020—he was slower and stiffer, his voice thinner—but his responses were razor-sharp compared with his performance at the June 27, 2024, debate that Jake co-moderated with Dana Bash on CNN.

In that October interview, after noting that Biden was about to turn 80, Jake said that whenever anyone raised concerns about his age, Biden would always say, “Watch me.” But voters had been watching him—and one poll showed that almost two-thirds of Democratic voters wanted a new nominee, mainly because of Biden's age.

Read: How Biden destroyed his legacy

“Well, they're concerned about whether or not I'd get anything done,” Biden said. “Look what I've gotten done. Name me a president, in recent history, who's gotten as much done as I have in the first two years. Not a joke. You may not like what I got done. But the vast majority of the American people do like what I got done.”

That wasn't particularly true—more than two-thirds of the country thought the nation was on the wrong track, and Biden's approval rating was underwater—and it was also not the question Jake had asked. The president and his inner circle had assessed his age as a political liability, but they hadn't stopped to consider the question of his actual ability. They sought to hide the fact that vigor was a commodity in scarce supply.

The president and his team were delighted by his lively performance at the 2024 State of the Union. Afterward, when Biden came down onto the floor of the House of Representatives, he was swarmed by adoring Democrats.

Quigley hadn't been so close to Biden since they were in Dublin almost a year before. He put his hand on the president's back. He could feel his ribs, and his spine. It seemed weird to consider, but it made him think of what it would be like to touch the aged, feeble Mr. Burns from The Simpsons. The president's voice was soft and breathy. His eyes darted from side to side. Quigley was again disconcertingly reminded of his late father.

The president's disastrous debate performance a few months later was not a tremendous surprise to Quigley.

“We have to be honest with ourselves that it wasn't just a horrible night,” Quigley told CNN's Kasie Hunt on July 2. A few days later, he became one of the first Democratic officials to call for the president to step down from the ticket. He was reminded of when he'd had to take the car keys from his mother, who was losing her vision.

The response was predictable. “What the fuck are you doing?” one colleague asked him. “It's too late!” said another.

Then-Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota had tried to sound the alarm about all this in 2022, vainly attempting to recruit midwestern governors to challenge the incumbent president in the primaries before ultimately launching his own campaign. Drawing attention to the president's declining acuity was pretty much his only issue. The party apparatus circled around the president like the Praetorian Guard, shielding him from debates and trying to keep Phillips off ballots. Given his lack of traction in polls, Phillips soon disappeared. When Special Counsel Robert Hur, who had been investigating Biden for improperly possessing and sharing classified materials, tried to discuss the president's memory and presentation when explaining his decision not to prosecute, the Democratic Party and White House painted him as a right-wing hack. Journalists who raised the issue were viciously attacked by lawmakers and besmirched on social media.

Quigley experienced some of the same treatment.

“If you bring this up publicly, you're just going to hurt him,” one representative told him.

“What difference does it make?” said another. “He's the candidate no matter what, so everyone should shut up.”

“You're a traitor!” a fellow member of the Illinois delegation told Quigley after he went public. “It's ageism. You're going to make us lose!”

This past March, town halls for both Democratic and Republican elected officials were so packed with angry constituents that some members of Congress opted instead for virtual meetings that were easier to control, or skipped them entirely. Quigley relished chatting with Chicago communities, despite getting earfuls of complaints. He'd been doing it for 47 years, first as an aide to an alderman and then serving on the Cook County Board of Commissioners before his election to the House.

But this spring, the vitriol aimed at Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Illinois's own Senator Dick Durbin has been over-the-top. Quigley has never seen anything like it.

“They go back to the original sin,” Quigley said, explaining their anger at Biden's decision to run for a second term. “They perceive that he was selfish. He couldn't see that he couldn't win.”

People appreciated that Quigley was one of the first Democratic officials to publicly call for Biden to step aside. “But it was too late,” one activist told him. She was angry at the party's leadership, but most of all, at Biden. “They couldn't let their egos get out of the way,” she said. “He saved our democracy and then he doomed it again.”

Quigley sensed that Democrats were going to be mad for a long time about the refusal of Biden and those around him to acknowledge what was happening to him.

What's more, Quigley knew they were right.

COVID came on the heels of the opioid crisis. Many people, especially in red states, were suffering from an addiction to a class of medicines once promoted as cutting-edge science. The opioid crisis is but one example of ethical failings in American health care. The essence of the Hippocratic oath—to place patient welfare over every other motive—has been assailed by incentives to both over- and undertreat, costing citizens time, blood, and money. Although I hope, with Frum, that the future belongs to those who help their country, we need to first agree that it is dead wrong for anyone, in any way, to profit from hurting people.

I really appreciate David Frum's writing, but I think this article brushed over valid skepticism of the government in a moment of crisis. The official advice was always presented as an edict. I didn't appreciate being told not to ask questions. Similarly, I understood why some were nervous about receiving rushed vaccines with brand-new mRNA technology. I would love to see both sides of this debate conduct an open postmortem. That would be good for all of us.

Thank you to David Frum for his analysis of why the COVID deniers won. But as a physician, I believe Frum missed one of the major reasons denying COVID paid off for Donald Trump. This factor is medical, not social, and if we are to avoid an even bigger disaster during the next pandemic, it's crucial that we understand it.

Trump lucked out in part because of the nature of the coronavirus, which was relatively less lethal than other viral species. Most deaths occurred in patients who were old, chronically ill, or suffering from other preexisting conditions. As a result, the pandemic, tragic as it was, lacked the element of horror that might accompany one caused by more inherently lethal viruses. No wonder people ended up sneering at masks and school closures. Right-wing media could spin COVID denial into a sensible response to what they presented as an epidemiological nonevent.

Unfortunately, Trump may not be so lucky next time. And a potential killer virus may be lurking just beyond the horizon: avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu. The World Health Organization views this virus with great alarm, because, having slashed through the poultry industry and many dairy herds, it is only a few mutations away from being able to pass from human to human. The death rate for bird flu is about 50 percent. Young people are not spared.

Any risks to the U.S. population would be magnified dramatically by President Trump's appointments and policies. The chances of quickly developing a vaccine, should bird flu begin infecting significant numbers of humans, appear small. It's not just the anti-vaxxers who will paralyze us: Our biomedical-research capabilities have been devastated by cuts to the National Institutes of Health's budget.

If an avian-influenza pandemic does hit, Trump could pull out the old COVID‑19 playbook. Why not? It worked the last time. But the viral character of the next pandemic could make it difficult for him to evade responsibility for the nightmare that may follow.

In the first weeks after the coronavirus struck, many decisions had to be made quickly based on imperfect information. Unsurprisingly, many of those decisions now look wrong.

But the most lethal of all the bad decisions was the effort to discourage conservative-leaning Americans from receiving COVID vaccines. Tens of thousands of people died unnecessarily because they followed advice from leaders they trusted.

Lockdowns were too draconian. Masking was mostly useless. Blue-state schools should have reopened faster. But those mistakes all shrink in gravity compared with the malicious effort to disparage vaccination. So, yes, let's criticize the errors of the overzealous. But right now, the people who hold government power in the United States are those with the deadliest record—and no conscience.

In the March issue, Gary Shteyngart wrote about his quest to end a lifetime of fashion misery.

Gary Shteyngart looks indescribably cool and writerly in his new suit! I'd offer to marry Gary based solely on how he looks in that suit, walking those New York streets like he owns them. Boston ladies love a man in a good suit.

Ruth Morss Cambridge, Mass.

Reading “Behold My Suit!” was gratifying on many levels. I wholly agree that women should not have all the fun with clothes. Some people dress to impress others, and some people dress to please themselves; perfection is reached when you can do both at once. I envy Shteyngart for hitting the bull's-eye.

Not that I would ever dream of claiming greater shoe expertise than Yohei Fukuda—but brown suede shoes with a blue suit? Brown shoes with a dark-blue suit are acceptable, but not preferred. Plus, the world's most elegant suede shoes are still informal. I'd never drop $3,000 on a pair of suede shoes, even if they had diamonds on their soles. And one final tip to the young men out there considering upping their fashion game: You can make even a $10,000 suit irrelevant if you don't bother to get a shave.

In the April issue, Judith Shulevitz considered how Chaim Grade's Sons and Daughters rescues a destroyed world.

I translated four of Chaim Grade's books and placed them with U.S. publishers in the 1970s. I had a wonderful personal relationship with Grade, a kind of uncle-nephew bond. I'm proud to have helped put him on the map: When I finished translating Grade's two-volume masterwork, The Yeshiva, I found a home for it with the venerable Bobbs-Merrill, a more famous publisher than those that had issued my earlier translations. It also published my first novel, The Yemenite Girl.

Many ultra-Orthodox Jews read Grade's work, including Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the leader of the worldwide Chabad organization. Grade told me that Schneerson once called him to ask how he was feeling, somehow sensing that he was ill.

“Rebbe, how did you know I was not well?” Grade asked.

“Because for two weeks I did not see your weekly chapter of The Yeshiva in the Morgn-Journal,” the Rebbe answered. “So I thought something must be the matter.” The Morgn-Journal was a Yiddish daily to which Grade contributed fiction.

Shulevitz is right to note that, aside from his Holocaust memoir, The Seven Little Lanes, Grade did not mention the Holocaust in his work. But if you read carefully the last page of The Yeshiva, where the two protagonists stand on a platform full of people awaiting the arrival of a train, one cannot help but feel in Grade's elegiac tone a recognition that other trains will soon be coming.

In this month's cover story, “Donald Trump Is Enjoying This,” Ashley Parker and Michael Scherer offer a definitive account of the president's political comeback. They discussed with Trump how he is using his power, and drawing on the lessons of his first term, to run the country (and, in his words, “the world”). For our cover image, the illustrator Dale Stephanos rendered in pencil a photograph of Trump taken in North Las Vegas last fall.

In 1965, the two intellectual giants squared off in a debate at Cambridge. It didn't go quite as Buckley hoped.

In February 1965, three months after Barry Goldwater had been trounced by Lyndon B. Johnson in the presidential election, one of the Republican candidate's most forceful advocates, William F. Buckley Jr., had an important event on his calendar. Taking a break from his annual ski vacation in Switzerland with his wife, Pat, he made his way to England for a debate at the Cambridge Union with one of the most celebrated writers alive, the novelist, memoirist, critic, and essayist James Baldwin. Buckley had been paying attention to Baldwin. He had read and admired his novel Another Country, which subtly explored complex gay and racial themes. But he disliked Baldwin's journalism and his profuse commentary on race. Baldwin, he had written, “celebrates his bitterness against the white community mostly in journals of the far political left,” which suggested complicity—or was it cowardice?—on the part of guilt-ridden white editors.

Baldwin's presence in England was itself an event. He was there to promote the paperback edition of Another Country and to discuss a screenplay with a filmmaker. He also made himself available to journalists and students. And there was the debate with Buckley at the Cambridge Union—a debate on the subject of race in America.

Baldwin's numerous venues were not, as it happened, limited to those of the left. His arguments, moreover, were original and unorthodox, and at times even paralleled Buckley's own. Baldwin, too, was skeptical of liberal programs and the meliorist principles they rested on. When he observed that the “mountain of sociological investigations, committee reports, and plans for recreational centers have failed to change the face of Harlem,” a conservative could agree.

The difference came in the conclusions Baldwin drew. The true lessons of race in America, he argued, began in what had been revealed about its white population. “The interracial drama acted out on the American continent has not only created a new black man,” he wrote as early as 1953; “it has created a new white man, too.” This was a year before the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education outlawing segregation in public schools, and two years before the Montgomery bus boycott. Yet Baldwin understood that the white monopoly on racial discourse was already weakening. What that new white man seemed unable to understand, much less accept, was that “this world is white no longer, and it will never be white again.”

It would never be so, because “white power has been broken,” Baldwin had said in a debate with Malcolm X in 1961. “And this means, among other things, that it is no longer possible for an Englishman to describe an African and make the African believe it. It's no longer possible for a white man in this country to tell a Negro who he is, and make the Negro believe this.”

In the 1964 election, Johnson, the incumbent, had tagged Goldwater as an extremist, and had coasted to one of the most overwhelming victories in history, winning 44 states and the District of Columbia. And the extremist charge had a sound basis. Goldwater had been one of only six Republicans to vote against the landmark Civil Rights Act when the Senate passed it in June 1964. At the GOP's nominating convention in San Francisco a month later, a desperate attempt by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to add an anti-extremism plank to the party platform had been thunderously rejected. Five of the six states that Goldwater won in November—all but his own Arizona—were in the Deep South. The journalist Robert Novak observed that Goldwater and his allies had completed their makeover of the GOP into “the White Man's Party.”

And a primary shaper of that new party was Bill Buckley. In the pages of National Review, the political fortnightly he had founded in 1955 and still edited, he and his colleagues continued to support segregation in the South, a decade after the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown. In his writing, he referred to the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and others in the civil-rights movement as lawbreakers and agitators.

Buckley had become, at age 39, the right's undisputed intellectual leader, who as a speaker, a columnist, and an author made his case with remarkable fluency and wit. Goldwater “has near him at least one man who can think,” the novelist and Syracuse University professor George P. Elliott had warned. Commenting on an address Buckley had given to a college audience, Elliott judged him “an all-or-none theocratic zealot of the most dangerous kind,” partly because “his criticism of the faults of the liberal rulers of the nation was incisive and accurate; his forensic power and control were by far the greatest I have heard in an American speaker.” Now, as Republican strategists struggled to move forward, Buckley's forensic talents were among the few assets they could count on.

For years, Buckley had wanted to debate Baldwin. He was all the more eager to do so after the publication of Baldwin's polemic The Fire Next Time, in 1963. With this small, powerful book, Baldwin became a different writer: no longer a witness to racial injustice but a prophet of racial reckoning.

Read: The famous Baldwin-Buckley debate still matters today

Most of the book had been first published as a long article in The New Yorker in November 1962, and Buckley had read it during his preparation for a two-week visit to South Africa and Mozambique as a guest of their respective governments. Buckley was especially impressed by South Africa's prime minister, Hendrik Verwoerd, the principal creator of apartheid in 1948. To Buckley, apartheid—literally racial “separatehood” in Afrikaans—was more than defensible. It was a kind of ideal system in a caste-divided society, what Jim Crow might have become if only its architects had been more systematic in their thinking and had embraced the concept of fully developed separate nations, Black and white.

Despite Verwoerd's valiant efforts, Buckley reported in National Review, South Africa was beset with peril. The threat came from the “beady eyes of the Communist propaganda machine,” which was cynically stirring the embers of “black racism.” In Buckley's view, this left Verwoerd only one sensible option: cracking down on dissidents. For “in such an eutectic situation it is necessary to maintain very firm control. Relentless vigilance” and “relentless order” were required “because the eudaemonic era has not yet come to Africa.” Eutectic, eudaemonic : Buckley had a weakness for arcane words, which he deployed as weapons. The more fragile his argument, the more syllables he used: “preemptive obfuscations,” as one of his protégés, the novelist and critic John Leonard, called them. But in this instance, the tongue twisters could not obscure raw facts; 70 percent of South Africa's population was Black, and eventually that majority would assert itself and challenge white dominance—just what was happening in the American South.

Baldwin also had things to say about South Africa and Verwoerd. The Fire Next Time included a bold assertion about the origins of radical evil over the past two millennia. “Whatever white people do not know about Negroes reveals, precisely and inexorably, what they do not know about themselves,” Baldwin wrote.

White Christians have also forgotten several elementary historical details. They have forgotten that the religion that is now identified with their virtue and their power—“God is on our side,” says Dr. Verwoerd—came out of a rocky piece of ground in what is now known as the Middle East before color was invented, and that in order for the Christian church to be established, Christ had to be put to death, by Rome, and that the real architect of the Christian church was not the disreputable, sun-baked Hebrew who gave it his name but the mercilessly fanatical and self-righteous St. Paul.

Baldwin did not pause to analyze. He did not allow the emotion to cool. He saw in Paul a zealous convert and proselytizer, and he also saw the intolerance, extremism, prejudice, and persecution that would come in the name of faith. The Christian world, he wrote, “has revealed itself as morally bankrupt and politically unstable.” With the Church's long history of anti-Semitism in the background, he stated bluntly: “The fact of the Third Reich alone makes obsolete forever any question of Christian superiority.” The Holocaust—the most radical instance of modern evil—was thus not truly surprising to him and other Black Americans. Just as Christians had monstrously mistreated Jews, so “white men in America do not behave toward black men the way they behave toward each other. When a white man faces a black man, especially if the black man is helpless, terrible things are revealed.”

Buckley had been affronted by the line Baldwin drew from Saint Paul to the gas chambers. But he was also well aware that Baldwin was steeped in Church history and teaching, and knew scripture far better than Buckley himself. The stepson of a Pentecostal minister, Baldwin had been a teenage preacher before abandoning what his book called “the church racket”—the phrase all but calculated to stir the wellspring of Buckley rage. Nothing defined Buckley so fully as his Catholicism. He had been raised in the Church and as a teenager had talked of joining the priesthood. As recently as 1961, he had told an admirer, “If I am ever persuaded that my attachment to conservatism gets in the way of my attachment to the Catholic Church, I shall promptly forsake the former.” At the same time, Buckley knew how deft Baldwin's glancing reference to Verwoerd had been. During the Second World War, Verwoerd had been enthusiastic in his support for Nazi Germany, and openly anti-Semitic.

But Buckley was, among many other things, a first-rate editor. He recognized that Baldwin had written a major statement and must be met on his own ground. One National Review contributor had the intellectual and literary gifts to do it, a young critic whom Buckley esteemed above all others—Garry Wills.

In 1958, when Wills had applied to Harvard's Ph.D. program in classics after a summer working at NR, Buckley had written a recommendation saying, “There simply is no doubt in my mind that twenty-five years hence he will be conceded one of the nation's top critics and literary craftsmen.” (Wills had gone instead to Yale, which offered a better fellowship.) He was now teaching at Johns Hopkins and writing prolifically for NR. He could handle almost any subject—history, literature, philosophy, politics, religion. Better still, he had spent six years preparing for the priesthood, as a Jesuit, before being released from his vows so he could enjoy a secular life of marriage and family and pursue a literary career. Up to now, Wills had written very little on race, but what he had written was less ideological than most other NR commentary on the subject. Wills made no defense of segregation and was dismissive (like Buckley) of white racists who argued for their own biological superiority.

From the July 2002 issue: The loyal Catholic

What Buckley did not know was how formative race had been for Wills. He had grown up in the Midwest, but his family came from the South and were typical white southerners of the time. Once, “on a family visit to Louisville,” Wills later recalled, “my grandmother took me to Sunday Mass and a Black priest came out from the sacristy. My grandmother snatched me by the hand and hauled me outside. When I asked her why, she—who would never go without Mass on Sunday—said she could not stand to see a ‘nigger' at the altar. I observed that she had Black women help her bake loaves of bread for sale in her kitchen, but she answered: ‘A nigger does not deserve the dignity of the priesthood.' ”

At Wills's Jesuit seminary near St. Louis, his training included orderly service in a hospital. Most of the patients were Black. He and other seminarians “gave the men their baths, rubbed cream on to prevent bedsores, and washed the bodies of those who died.” Wills's best friend in the seminary was Black and “told me of the obstacles the order had put in the way of his joining—he was bluntly told that Southerners in the novitiate would resent his presence.”

This resistance was one reason, Wills believed, that meeting “the demands (even legitimate demands) of some” to outlaw segregation might “bend the permanent structure of our society permanently out of shape” and “sacrifice the peace of all of us.” To that extent, Wills could sympathize with white southerners. But they must also respond humanely. This was the test being failed time and again.

The permanent structure of society was Baldwin's theme too, only he was making the opposite case: The structure itself was rotten and awaited the match that would set it ablaze. Here Wills was ready to meet Baldwin. Unlike Buckley, who read just enough of books he disliked to collect ammunition for disparaging them, Wills brought Jesuitical thoroughness and precision to his reading. He read not only The Fire Next Time, but just about everything else Baldwin had published, and he was overwhelmed by its artistry and power.

Wills had agonized over the assignment, he told Buckley in the winter of 1963. “But after tearing up many attempts at the thing, I send this off immediately, before I decide to tear it up.” He still was afraid he had not risen to the task, because refuting Baldwin required “new arguments for civilization”—and, Wills confessed, “I don't know any.” There were only the old arguments, and under the pressure of Baldwin's impassioned language, they seemed to wilt. “There is virtuosity, even a dark gaiety in his anger,” Wills wrote in his article. Baldwin, he went on, had an “uncanny way of writing to a background music that somehow gets transmitted along with the words.”

And his account of America's racial history was accurate. “We have been cruel to the Negro,” Wills wrote. “We have, more than we know; more than we want to know.” But Baldwin did not limit his attack to white America alone. He condemned the system of belief from which the entirety of Western civilization arose. “He does not attack us for not living up to our ideals, for lapsing, for sinning, for being bad Christians,” Wills went on. “He says we do not have any ideals: we do not believe in any of the things our religion, our civilization, our country stand for. It is all an elaborate lie whose sole and original function is to fortify privilege.”

Baldwin's sweeping denunciation ignored the saving virtues of the Western tradition—its humanism, its ideas of justice and human dignity, its embrace of charity as a defining principle—the same ideals that informed his own writing. Yet reviewers seemed uninterested in pointing out this rather obvious omission. Why? This was the question Wills's essay asked and tried to answer. What looked like sympathy for Baldwin, he concluded, was in reality a condescending refusal to take him seriously—arrant hypocrisy that Baldwin himself exposed by “attacking all our so-called beliefs, then standing back and observing that no one defends them. In fact, everyone rushes to defend him.”

Instead, Wills wrote,

somebody should take Baldwin's charges seriously enough to ask, not whether they are moving, or beautiful, or important, or sincerely meant—they are obviously all these, and there has been enough repetition of the obvious—but whether they are true.

In depicting white evil in absolute terms, Wills believed, Baldwin foreclosed the possibility of redemption—this despite an evident history of moral growth and improvement. Wills acknowledged the discomfort of defending the existence and importance of ideals so brutally violated by the race to which one belonged, but insisted on its necessity. “We must have the courage to defend the ideals we have, perhaps, not lived up to, but only known to be true. It takes a special courage to bear witness in this way; to be wrong, yet defend what was right; to be what one is, yet continue to fight for what one should have been; to oppose a better man than oneself in the service of a better creed than his.”

From the July/August 2009 issue: Garry Wills on the daredevil Willam F. Buckley

Nothing like this had ever been published in National Review. Even as Wills disagreed with Baldwin, he ceded him high authority as an artist and praised in exalted terms what the magazine's chief political theorist, James Burnham, in his book Suicide of the West, was soon to call “the abusive writings of a disoriented Negro homosexual.” Another respected NR elder—its books editor Frank Meyer, Wills's mentor at the magazine—pleaded with Buckley not to publish the essay. But Buckley was captivated. What Wills had written was quite possibly National Review's “finest hour,” he later said.

Overruling Meyer, Buckley edited the essay himself; printed it at eight full pages under the title Wills had chosen, “What Color Is God?”; and made it the cover story. It appeared in May 1963 just after the historic civil-rights protest in Birmingham, Alabama. Americans watched televised footage of firefighters as they aimed fire hoses at children who were then slammed to the pavement, the pressure of the hoses turned so high, The New York Times reported, that the spray “skinned bark off trees.”

At the time, Buckley also efficiently drew on Wills's argument in his own writing about Baldwin. One column restated the argument so closely that it “suggests some interesting reflections on your conception of editing and/or plagiarism,” Wills protested. But Buckley also honed Wills's nuanced words into the sharp blade of accusation. The Fire Next Time, Buckley wrote, was a violently racist tract—“A Call to Lynch the White God.”

None of this deterred Baldwin from agreeing to debate Buckley in early 1965. “It will be a tough one,” Buckley wrote to a friend. And he had made it no easier by taunting Baldwin in a column only weeks beforehand, calling him the “Number-1 America-hater.”

Buckley had no idea what to expect from the audience he would face at the Cambridge Union. For a recent debate on the Labour Party's “hypocritical attitude on immigration,” one Labour member of Parliament after another declined to come. The union had held the event anyway, and 200 demonstrators had marched through campus, many carrying banners and placards saying the Conservative speaker was a racist. Forty police officers had been brought in to protect him. American civil-rights leaders, by contrast, had been warmly received in England. In December, when King, en route to Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, had stopped over in London to give a sermon at St. Paul's Cathedral—“the first non-Anglican ever allowed in the pulpit” there, according to King's biographer Taylor Branch—some 4,000 people had turned out to hear him, more than the great church could seat.

Cambridge Union debates were held in the evening, preceded by a dinner, with the student leaders as hosts and the invited guests seated on either side of the union's president. Not this time. Baldwin had instead requested to be seated as far as possible from Buckley. He wanted no pre-debate pleasantries. Buckley respected this. He also disliked forced geniality with strong adversaries; it made going after them harder.

The union hall that night—Thursday, February 18—was filled to capacity and beyond. “By eight o'clock, the hall was so jam-packed with students that officials had to set up crash barriers,” the political scientist Nicholas Buccola writes in his 2019 account of the debate, The Fire Is Upon Us. All the benches were taken, and many students sat on the floor. Buckley and Baldwin had to pick their way past them as they were led to the long table at the front of the room. Buckley had two British companions with him—his close friend, the journalist and historian Alistair Horne, and the film star James Mason, who sat high above in the gallery. Baldwin's small entourage sat there too. Hundreds more viewers gathered in nearby rooms with TV screens, making the total audience about 1,000.

The BBC had sent a crew for a broadcast. “I don't think I've ever seen the union so well attended,” said the Tory MP Norman St. John-Stevas, who was there as the station's commentator. To a home audience that had never heard of William F. Buckley, St. John-Stevas explained that he was “very well known as a conservative in the United States,” smiling as he added, “I must stress, a conservative in the American sense”—closer, in British terms, to a Manchester-school classical liberal—and “one of the early supporters of Senator Goldwater.”

The topic of the debate called to mind an especially provocative sentence in The Fire Next Time : “The Negroes of this country may never be able to rise to power,” Baldwin had written, “but they are very well placed indeed to precipitate chaos and ring down the curtain on the American dream.” The motion put up for debate was this: “The American dream is at the expense of the American Negro.” The phrase American dream was one that Buckley seldom, if ever, used except ironically, but he would now be forced to defend it.

Baldwin began by saying that, in terms of the Black experience, American dream was an all but meaningless expression. “Let me put it this way,” he said in what became the most famous words spoken that evening:

From a very literal point of view, the harbors and the ports, and the railroads of the country—the economy, especially of the southern states, could not conceivably be what it has become if they had not had, and do not still have, indeed and for so long, for many generations, cheap labor. I am stating very seriously, and this is not an overstatement, that I picked the cotton, and I carried it to the market, and I built the railroads under someone else's whip for nothing, for nothing.

The custom at Cambridge Union debates was for audience members to address questions to the speaker, even interrupting to demand a reply. But Baldwin's words were as much sermon as argument—“a highly refined version of soapbox speech,” one of Baldwin's biographers later wrote—even as his description of the capitalist uses of slavery was grounded in historical fact. In 1965, structural racism was a new idea, certainly for this audience, which had been stunned into silence. Hardly anyone stirred. When Baldwin finished, after almost half an hour, the ovation lasted a full minute. “The whole of the union standing and applauding this magnificent speech of James Baldwin,” St. John-Stevas excitedly told the BBC audience. “Never seen this happen before.”

All the while, Buckley had been sitting by, writing notes on his yellow pad, thinking, as he later recalled, “Boy, tonight is a lost cause.” For years to come, he would maintain that the debate had contrasted his exercise in high logic with Baldwin's emotionalism. But many present that day thought otherwise. Baldwin had been careful not to say a word about Buckley, not even to utter his name. He had stood at the podium and spoken as if in a kind of reverie. But Buckley, when his turn came, “stalked the center debating table like a panther,” The New York Times reported. “He began in a low monotone, almost a snarl.”

From the April 1968 issue: What makes Bill Buckley run

And the snarling words were distinctly ad hominem, a direct attack on Baldwin himself and the hypocrisy of his admirers. Baldwin's writings constituted a bitter catalog of American sins, yet no one challenged him. Instead he was “treated from coast to coast in the United States with a kind of unctuous servitude, which, in point of fact, goes beyond anything that was ever expected from the most servile Negro creature by a southern family.”

Baldwin's indictment of America was so sweeping, Buckley continued, that it deserved to be met head-on, which meant granting him no special favors. Baldwin could not be engaged squarely in debate

unless one is prepared to deal with him as a white man. Unless one is prepared to say to him, “The fact that your skin is black is utterly irrelevant to the arguments that you raise.” The fact that you sit here, as is your rhetorical device, and lay the entire weight of the Negro ordeal on your own shoulders is irrelevant to the argument that we are here to discuss.

But it was Buckley who seemed disconnected from the larger context. Wills was soon to denounce (in his new column in the National Catholic Reporter) “the savage policemen of Mississippi and Alabama” who had been brutalizing people seeking only their constitutional right to vote. Buckley simply reverted to the two-year-old argument from “What Color Is God?,” which he repeated almost verbatim. “The gravamen of Mr. Baldwin's charges against America,” Buckley said, is “not so much that our civilization has failed him and his people, that our ideals are insufficient, but that we have no ideals.” Baldwin had written this in The Fire Next Time and asserted it again in the union, only “he didn't, in writing that book, speak with the British accents that he used exclusively tonight.”

Up to that moment, Baldwin had been almost impassive as Buckley spoke. The BBC camera now captured his look of angry surprise. There was nothing “British” in Baldwin's accents. He was a practiced and polished speaker, who had gone before many audiences and spoken exactly as he had on this occasion, in elevated tones steeped, like his prose, in the vocabulary and cadences of the King James Bible. Buckley had insinuated that it was a kind of minstrel performance worked up for this British audience. Murmurs of disapproval and loud hissing rose in the hall.

Buckley, always attentive to his audiences and their responses, realized he had erred. He tried to recover. He took this debate seriously. He took all debates seriously, often writing out his major statement in advance. Tonight, as always, he had a case to make. He rightly pointed to the logical error, the “soritic” leap, by which Baldwin connected the “fanatic” teachings of Paul to the genocide at Dachau. He accurately remarked that other countries had histories of persecution no better than America's.

But other realities seemed lost on him. When he acknowledged “those psychic humiliations which I join Mr. Baldwin in believing are the worst aspects of discrimination,” he cited an incident in The Fire Next Time, when the 13-year-old Baldwin had been walking along Fifth Avenue on his way to the public library, and a policeman had said, “Why don't you niggers stay uptown where you belong?” But Buckley said nothing about Baldwin's recollection of having been accosted at age 10 by two white police officers, who “amused themselves with me by frisking me, making comic (and terrifying) speculations concerning my ancestry and probable sexual prowess, and for good measure, leaving me flat on my back in one of Harlem's empty lots.” Flat on his back. This wasn't merely psychic humiliation; it was physical intimidation and threat. “I have been carried into precinct basements often enough,” Baldwin wrote,

and I have seen and heard and endured the secrets of desperate white men and women, which they knew were safe with me, because even if I should speak, no one would believe me. And they would not believe me precisely because they would know that what I said was true.

Those secrets were the secrets of violence committed with impunity. Even now, Buckley seemed unable to grasp this reality of America's racial history—very much alive in the winter of 1965. On the same day that Buckley and Baldwin met in debate, voting-rights demonstrators who'd assembled peacefully in a downtown square in Marion, Alabama, had been sadistically beaten by state troopers. The victims included a Black minister whose skull had been cracked as he knelt in prayer. The police had also attacked an 82-year-old man and his 50-year-old daughter. Both had been hospitalized. When a third member of the family had leaped at the officer beating his mother, the officer had shot him in the stomach. (He died eight days later.) These were the facts putting the promise of the American dream to the test.

When the debate ballots were counted, the motion carried 544 to 164, a lopsided defeat for Buckley. “Baldwin worsted Bill,” Buckley's friend Alistair Horne recalled in 2013. “He was electric, so wonderfully articulate, and—this is what I think shook Bill—so highly entertaining.”

This last would have stung most of all. Buckley had been not just outdebated but outperformed. Soon after, Buckley opened The New York Times and saw almost the entire transcript of the debate printed without permission in the newspaper's magazine. The two combatants now found common cause. Baldwin's lawyer let Buckley know so both could lodge a protest. Playboy had reportedly offered Baldwin as much as $10,000 to publish his remarks. Eventually he and Buckley received token payments of $400 each. The Times article appeared in print on March 7, the day of the voting-rights march from Selma to Montgomery, Bloody Sunday.

The Cambridge fiasco might have permanently damaged Buckley's reputation—except there was a second debate with Baldwin, under very different conditions. It happened in New York in late May 1965 on Open End, a talk show moderated by the TV personality and producer David Susskind. The subject was police brutality in big cities. In the South, the violence was plain for all to see—the beatings and killings of people seeking the right to vote. But in the North, the issue was more complex, especially in places such as New York, where rising crime was inextricably bound up with the emergence of white “backlash politics.”

Open End 's format was more favorable to Buckley than the formal Cambridge proceedings had been. The three men were seated and went back and forth for nearly two hours. One columnist described Buckley this time as “cool, detached, confident,” and in command as he warned that the talented Baldwin was also “destructive and sullen,” and on a course that would ultimately harm Black people. “The best fight in town,” the columnist wrote. Less than two weeks later, Buckley called a press conference and confirmed the rumor that had been building for weeks: The “one man who can think” in the conservative movement declared himself a candidate for mayor of New York City.

Buckley lost the election, but it made him a household name—and fed an ambition to reach a broader audience and become a facilitator of discussion rather than a mere combatant. He launched his own TV debate program, Firing Line, in 1966; the guests eventually included the Black Panthers Eldridge Cleaver and Huey P. Newton. “Amazingly, a PBS public affairs program designed to convert Americans to conservatism,” the media historian Heather Hendershot later wrote, was broadcasting “some of the most comprehensive representations of Black Power” of that era. National Review had praised Malcolm X's doctrine of self-reliance, and Buckley's own enthusiasm for “black capitalism” was one reason the National Urban League invited him to join a group of other journalists it sent on a tour of eight cities in 1969. Buckley was impressed by the leaders he met, in particular by a young Chicago organizer, Jesse Jackson. The next year Buckley, who came to see The Fire Next Time as a “spectacular essay,” wrote an article for Look magazine titled, “Why We Need a Black President in 1980.” He knew that it would happen eventually and almost lived to see it. Buckley died at age 82 on February 27, 2008, three months before Barack Obama clinched the Democratic nomination.

This article was adapted from Sam Tanenhaus's new book, Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America. It appears in the June 2025 print edition with the headline “When Buckley Met Baldwin.”

Iain Banks's Culture novels take place in a socialist utopia. The broligarchs love them.

by  Constance Grady

One of the most momentous developments of the new Trump era is how major billionaires in the tech industry — frequently known as the broligarchs — have thrown their weight behind the president. During the 2024 election, they offered high-profile support and made big donations; after the inauguration, they announced new company policies that aligned them with President Donald Trump's regressive cultural ideologies. 

Elon Musk had already turned Twitter into a right-wing echo chamber since purchasing it in 2022, and spent several chaotic months earlier this year as Trump's government efficiency henchman. Jeff Bezos has revamped the Washington Post's editorial section to build support for “personal liberties and free markets.” Mark Zuckerberg decided to get rid of fact-checkers at Meta. 

It was a massive show of power that revealed how possible it is for these wealthy men to remake our culture in their own image, transforming how we speak to each other and what we know to be true. Using that power on Trump's behalf seems to have paid mixed dividends for Silicon Valley, but it nonetheless makes clear how important it is to understand their worldview and their vision for the future. 

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Which is why it is striking to note that Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg share a favorite author: Iain M. Banks, the Scottish science fiction writer best known for his Culture series. Banks is an odd choice for a bunch of tech billionaires. The author, who died in 2013, was a socialist and avowed hater of the super-rich.

“The Culture series is certainly, in terms of more modern science fiction, one of my absolute favorites,” Bezos told GeekWire in 2018, adding, “there's a utopian element to it that I find very attractive.” Bezos has attempted twice to adapt the series for TV at Amazon, once in 2018 and again in February. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg picked the Culture novel Player of Games for his book club in 2015. 

Banks is an odd choice for a bunch of tech billionaires. The author, who died in 2013, was a socialist and avowed hater of the super-rich.

The most avowed Culture fan among the broligarchs, however, is Musk. Musk has named Space X drone ships after the starships in the Culture books. His original name for the neuralink — a computer chip that can be implanted in human brains, pioneered by his neurotechnology company — was the neural lace, a piece of telepathic technology that Banks came up with in the Culture books. In 2018, Musk declared himself “a utopian anarchist of the kind best described by Iain Banks.” (It's worth noting that in 2018, Musk was under fire for union busting but had not yet waded so far into national politics or declared public war against the “woke mind virus.”)

Plenty of us like and even identify with pieces of pop culture whose politics we don't entirely agree with, like the libertarian Little House on the Prairie books or the Christian Chronicles of Narnia. Still, the Banks Culture series, which consists of 10 books released between 1987 and 2012, is not politically coded so much as it is downright didactic. “The Culture is hippy commies with hyper-weapons and a deep distrust of both Marketolatry and Greedism,” Banks said in an interview with Strange Horizons in 2010, in a line that's only barely more explicit than the books themselves.

The Culture series takes place in a post-scarcity galactic society known only as the Culture, which strictly values empathy, pluralism, and social cooperation. Most of the volumes of the series see the Culture navigating an altercation with another civilization, usually one with a much less progressive ethos, and figuring out how to handle the resulting tension. Does the Culture intervene in the affairs of another planet to, for instance, stop the spread of a theocratic empire? What does it do about civilizations where slavery is legal?

The politics of these books are not subtle, and they are also not compatible with the existence of billionaires. So it's worth thinking about why the broligarchs have so consistently cited a socialist author as an inspiration. What do they find tantalizing about Banks' work? Are they missing the point altogether? 

Nearly every aspect of the Culture seems to be diametrically opposed to the worldview of the tech right.

Banks takes as his starting principle for the Culture the idea that a space-faring civilization will have to be socialist to be effective. In the hostile environment of the vacuum of space, he argues, you will need to be able to count on the collective. Banks further reasons that each spaceship or planet in the Culture will have to be reasonably self-sufficient to survive. 

At the same time, the Culture is stringently non-hierarchical and non-individualistic. There is no money and no want; therefore, there can't be any billionaires or any economic inequality. There are no laws and almost no crime. This is not a world in which supremely wealthy people who use their power to influence the social fabric make sense. 

“Succinctly; socialism within, anarchy without,” Banks concluded in a 1994 Usenet post in which he lays out his full theory of the Culture. 

In the Culture, should someone commit an action that most people agreed was unacceptable, everyone responds with social shaming rather than the rule of law: They stop inviting the person in question to parties. In other words, like a group of proper leftists, they deal with misbehavior by social cancellation, that great threat against which the broligarchs have declared war.

Even work-life balance in the Culture exists in opposition to the ethos of Silicon Valley. The Culture's citizens have invented vastly powerful AIs that take care of governance for them. This delegation frees up the Culture citizens themselves to indulge in what Banks describes as “the things that really mattered in life, such as sports, games, romance, studying dead languages, barbarian societies and impossible problems, and climbing high mountains without the aid of a safety harness.” Those who are burdened with too much ambition to be content in such a soft life take on (unpaid) jobs managing the Culture's relationships with other civilizations, mostly for the prestige and the adrenaline rush of it all. 

This vision appears to have influenced Musk's idea of a future in which AI has rendered work “optional,” so that “if you want to do a job that's kinda like a hobby, you can do a job.” Musk allows that there would need to be “universal high income” for this plan to work, but outlines no ideas as to how such an ambitious policy could take effect. In the meantime, in our own world, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla are all infamous for requiring employees to work abusively long hours. 

Finally, and perhaps most discordantly given the broligarchs' current gender politics, the Culture is genderfluid. Anyone can change gender just by thinking about it, and most people do at least once in their lives, a state of affairs Banks argues is responsible for its strict regime of gender equality. Meanwhile, Musk is notoriously anti-trans, Zuckerberg has been leaning into the retrograde gender ideologies of the manosphere as he tweaks Meta's policies to allow more hate speech, particularly toward LGBTQ+ people, and Amazon has removed LGBTQ+ rights support from its website.

But it's not just that the Culture holds the inverse of the ideology these men stand for. The most detestable villain in Banks's series is Joiler Veppers, a wealthy man in a civilization less evolved than the Culture, who uses his riches to purchase and influence media outlets, undercut labor unions, and rape his indentured servants. Veppers's money comes from a family fortune built in the computer game industry, and he compounds that fortune by investing in the servers to a series of virtual reality hellscapes, where unfortunates are horribly tortured for all eternity.

If you want to know how Banks views capitalist tech billionaires, you don't have to hunt very hard. In the Culture series, a capitalist tech billionaire is the literal devil, only he couldn't be bothered to build hell himself. 

So what's the appeal of the Culture series if you actually are a capitalist tech billionaire? Probably the tech itself.

If politics offer the Culture books their intellectual framing, the tech is what gives them their zing, their spectacle. Throughout the series, Banks lovingly describes spaceships and AIs (and lots of spaceships that are also AIs), and artificial planets and gizmos and gadgets. Generally, at the end of the book, the Culture uses one of those gizmos in an inventive way to win a big, explosive space war. 

Read through this light, the Culture's technological prowess offers the brute force that backs up its warm and fuzzy ideology. The Culture can afford to be idealistic and worry about its moral culpability because it has better technology than all the other civilizations it faces off with, which means it will nearly always win in a fight.

If you think of yourself as a titan of industry who is making that technology for your own culture — who is providing the brute force that allows for wishy-washy moralizing — there is a certain easy comfort that comes with this alignment. You know you are on the correct side of history because you're on the side that is building the strongest and most advanced technology. 

Yet within the larger metaphor Banks is building, the relationship between politics and strength is supposed to be the other way around. The Culture is not good because they are strong. Their strength is a metaphor for their goodness. They have the best technology because that shows that they are rational, that they value intelligence, that they are motivated to give their citizens the best possible quality of life. 

 The Culture is not good because they are strong. Their strength is a metaphor for their goodness.

To avoid this idea when reading Banks, you would have to be exquisitely attuned to the pleasurable spectacle of technology and the power that tech offers its users, and then ignore everything else. In that case, what the broligarchs' love of the Culture series reveals is that they see the world through the lens of power and spectacle first and foremost, and have no particular problem evading the work's deeper meaning. That's why this group has a propensity for big, pointless stunts, like trips to almost-space and carting a kitchen sink through Twitter headquarters and threatening to punch one another in a public fight. It's as though they feel entitled to their power because their favorite book taught them that the side with the best tech always wins, and the most important thing you can do with that tech is put on a show. They seem not to have read deeply enough to understand what the book was really trying to say: that the most important thing powerful people can do is use their power to make the world freer, fairer, and more pleasurable for everyone else.

Voters are souring on Trump — but that doesn't mean they're turning back to the party.

by  Christian Paz

Democrats have a lot to be excited about when they look at President Donald Trump's polls. Scores of voters have soured on his job performance since he took office. And that group of unhappy voters includes some of Trump's new 2024 converts — the young voters, disaffected voters, and voters of color who left the Democratic coalition to join Trump's.

But Trump's losses aren't translating to Democratic gains. The polling so far suggests that the voters disillusioned by Trump similarly dislike the Democrats — and are more likely to leave politics altogether than align themselves with the Democratic Party.

Congressional Democrats — and their party's national brand — remain dismal: Some 37 percent of voters view the party favorably, while about 60 percent view them unfavorably, according to YouGov's tracking surveys.

Compare that to the GOP's slightly better standing among voters in the same polls: 40 percent approve while 55 percent disapprove. Despite the early chaos and deluge of news during the first months of the Trump presidency, Republicans are either viewed more favorably than Democrats or running even with them in head-to-head polling.

That dynamic is very different from how the parties were viewed during Trump's first term. At this point in 2017, when Trump's job approval was similarly spiraling downward, Democrats enjoyed a modest, but constant, edge of support over Republicans as a majority of the country turned even more negatively against Trump's first-term agenda and performance. They sustained that advantage — generally a 3- to 6-point margin — through the 2018 “blue wave” midterms and beyond.

In 2025, the picture is more evenly divided: a broadly unpopular president and two unpopular parties.

A few interconnected reasons explain why Democrats are stuck in this conundrum — and offer some insight into what they have to do to get out of it.

So why aren't newly anti-Trump voters flocking to Democrats? Perhaps the most important reason is that they don't see Democrats as a better alternative. 

Consider April's ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, which was taken at what is, so far, the nadir of Trump's public support. 

Despite broad discontent over Trump's tariffs and inflation, Americans still said they trusted him “to do a better job handling the country's main problems” over Democrats by a 7-point margin — 37 percent to 30 percent. Another 30 percent said neither could do a better job, while 4 percent said both could do it equally.

Similarly, Americans are more likely to say that the Democratic Party is “out of touch” with the average person than either Trump or the Republican Party. About 70 percent of respondents say so about the Democrats, while 64 percent and 60 percent say so for Republicans and Trump respectively, according to that April poll.

And what about those Trump's newest voters — the youth and people of color who joined him in 2024? The data we have suggests they may be increasingly unhappy with Trump, but they're not running back to Democrats either.

The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life, from senior editor Patrick Reis.

Take the Spring 2025 Harvard Youth Poll, a project from that university's Institute of Politics which has been specifically polling and tracking young Americans under the age of 30 since 2000.

It found that young Americans' approval of Trump and congressional Republicans has remained steady over the last few years. But views of the Democratic Party have collapsed from 48 percent approval in 2020 to 23 percent in 2025. Young Black voters, specifically, have grown more supportive of Trump since 2017, the polling suggests. And the unifying theme, Harvard's analysts find, is a growing distrust of government — and political parties in general — even as the general ideology and values that young Americans hold seem to be moderating a little.

Something similar is happening among Latino voters, according to a poll conducted over the past month by the Latino firm Equis Research and Data for Progress.

Per the poll, Latino and Hispanic voters' support for the president is “trending slightly below” 2024 levels. Yet he hasn't seen a complete collapse in support, in part because some degree of voters still approve of his immigration, border security, and public safety policies, even if a growing share think he's overreaching. That's another difference from 2017, when these voters were strongly opposed.

But Trump's loss with Latinos does not appear to be Democrats' gain. Latino Americans, including young men and Biden 2020-Trump 2024 voters, seem to be rejecting both parties. The firm notes that among Latinos who dislike either Trump's immigration or economic policies, these voters “still don't trust Democrats more on the [issues].”

Another reason Democrats don't seem to be gaining much support among Trump disapprovers is that there are plenty of voters who are biding their time. Polls and anecdotal data suggest there are voters who are still willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt even if they are disappointed. They are unsure or unenthusiastic about some of Trump's job performance, but they're not willing to go so far as to say they would redo their vote or switch parties next year.

The gap between Trump's support and the GOP's support, for example, suggests that some voters might disapprove of how Trump has implemented his agenda, but still back Republicans in general. And the stabilizing of Trump's approval rating as he does less may signal that voters are returning to him as he rolls back or stands down some of his more controversial actions.

These kinds of voters show up a lot in focus groups conducted this spring, including those reported on by the New York Times, and in the wild.

While reporting in Philadelphia on remorseful Trump voters earlier this month, I encountered many voters who said they wouldn't redo their vote, but they still felt a bit let down with some of Trump's approach to the job. At least anecdotally, young Trump voters tended to say this. Nikita, a senior at Drexel who spoke to me and Today, Explained producer Miles Bryan, admitted he “expected things to be a little different.” But he also thought it was too soon to make a definitive judgment on the Trump presidency or his future vote.

“[I'd] probably give him either to the end of the year, or just give him a year at first just to see how things are going,” he said. “He's been in office for what, a few months now? So I guess it's not enough time yet to really see…if these tariffs are gonna play a big role in our economy and really spike up prices for a while. So just give it some time to see how things play out.”

The polling data also shows this dynamic. Trump hit a low point in his popularity in April, when he announced his tariff regime and after a slate of negative coverage related to DOGE and his immigration policy. As he dialed back his tariffs, DOGE receded, and headlines moved on to other news items, his approval ratings stabilized. Some polls are now even capturing a mid-May recovery. And through it all, most Trump voters, even in polls capturing growing disapproval, say they probably wouldn't change their votes. Instead, it appears that as Trump changed the implementation of his policies, the slide in approval from disaffected Republicans slowed down.

Finally, there's another kind of voter who may be peeling away from Trump's camp, but doesn't seem to be Democratic bait: those who tune out of politics entirely, don't follow the news avidly, and don't have strong allegiances to any party.

These low-propensity, low-information voters were the kinds who Trump was able to reach in 2024, contributing to rightward swings across gender, age, and racial demographics. Something about Trump uniquely appealed to him — what they might have heard about him on social media, podcasts, or from influencers — or they liked the snippets of his agenda and campaign that broke through to them. Democrats are still figuring out how to reach this demographic of voter — which skews younger — but they don't seem to have broken the code yet, meaning it may be more difficult for Democratic candidates to try to win them over, or reach them at all, in the future.

Earlier this month, the data analyst G. Elliot Morris quantified how much these kinds of voters have turned on Trump, finding a 33-point drop in support among people who pay “hardly” any attention to the news “at all.” That decline eclipses the drops among more engaged groups of Americans — his support among those Americans who follow the news “most of the time” has fallen by 14 points, for example, and started off at a much lower baseline of support to begin with. 

What's driving that sharp drop is still unclear. Other data sources suggest it's still the least engaged voters who have more positive views of certain Trump policies than more informed voters. But what remains true is that these voters aren't very ideological, aren't married to a political party, and thus aren't the kind of people who would necessarily turn out in a midterm election. 

That's another complication for Democrats who hope to profit off Trump's overall popularity decline.

For now, Trump and his party's standing seem to have reached a new equilibrium. He is unpopular, but still in a much better place than at this point during his first term.

Still, what's old is new: Democrats have been here before. A November 2017 CNN headline — “Poll: Views of Democratic Party hit lowest mark in 25 years” — reads almost exactly like a 2025 one. Just one year later, Democrats would flip 41 seats in the House. As Split Ticket data analysts Armin Thomas and Max McCall write, “the opposition party tends to become more popular in the run up to the midterms while the opposite happens for the incumbent party,” and unpopularity hasn't stopped sweeping midterms wins by Election Day.

And a lot more is going to change in the coming months. Candidates will launch campaigns and make their case. Ads and rallies will start picking up. And the media environment will be swamped with election talk once again. Generic “Democrat” and “Republican” views will turn into personalized and specific contests between real people. And voters of all sorts will get exposed and educated to political debates. That's the time when the incumbent party gets scrutinized more, and the opposition party may begin to look more favorable.

Democratic victories next year will surely depend on winning over some of the voters Trump seems to be turning off. But as we've seen in the Trump era, midterm and off-year elections tend to bring out electorates much more favorable to them than to Republicans. The same may happen next year.

Ranchers in Mexico once commonly killed jaguars. Now they're earning thousands of dollars to help save them.

SONORA, Mexico — This landscape didn't seem like a place to find jaguars, the world's most famous jungle cat. 

The ground was parched and rocky and mostly brown, other than the occasional cactus or palm tree. It was so hot and dry that even some of the prickly nopales were wilting.

Yet there it was — in the playback screen of a motion-sensing camera, strapped to an oak tree near a dry stream bed. Less than a week earlier, a large jaguar had walked exactly where I was now standing. Even from the small camera display, the cat looked imposing, with its oversized paws and a wide, skull-crushing jaw. 

It was a blistering afternoon in April, and I was in the Northern Jaguar Reserve, a protected area in Sonora about 125 miles south of the US border in Arizona. The reserve and the region around it are home to the world's northernmost population of jaguars, the largest cats in the Western Hemisphere, as well as three other species of wild felines: ocelots, bobcats, and mountain lions, or pumas.

The cat on the screen was named El Guapo. He's the largest of five or six resident jaguars in the reserve and has likely fathered a handful of kittens, Miguel Gómez Ramírez, the reserve manager, told me.

El Guapo has a bold personality: While some of the park's jaguars get spooked by the flash or sound of motion cameras scattered through the reserve, jumping in the air like surprised house cats, El Guapo doesn't seem to care. It's as if he knows he's at the top of the food chain. 

While jaguars are often associated with the tropics, they once ranged as far north as Southern California, the Grand Canyon, and possibly even Louisiana. The US had jaguars! 

Then they were gone. 

By the mid-1900s, ranchers and hunters had exterminated these felines, largely because they were seen — like many other wild predators — as a threat to cattle. Jaguars do occasionally kill cows, though few cases of livestock predation in the US have actually been verified. 

Over the last few decades, several male jaguars have been spotted in their historic territory in the American Southwest — most recently, in December 2023. The extraordinary sightings give environmental advocates hope that jaguars could one day return to the US, fixing a broken food chain and recovering an important missing piece of Indigenous culture in the southern borderlands.

Those cats all came from northern Mexico. They came from the region where I was now standing, slipping through some of the last remaining gaps in the border wall. 

That means any chance that jaguars now have of returning to the US depends on maintaining openings in the wall — and on an ample reserve of cats in northern Mexico. Jaguars can only reestablish in their northern range if they're sufficiently abundant in Mexico, where they're endangered. And like in the US, ranchers in Sonora have a long history of killing felines for their perceived, and occasionally real, threat to cattle. 

While the Northern Jaguar Reserve helps protect wild cats in Sonora, what had ultimately brought me to Mexico was a project to conserve jaguars that extends far beyond the park's boundary. 

For many years, a small group of scientists and advocates have been working to cast Sonora's jaguars in a different light — to turn them from beef-hungry villains to important features of the ecosystem that can bring ranchers financial reward. Those efforts appear to be paying off: The population of jaguars in the reserve and the ranching region around it is stable, if not growing, offering hope that people can live harmoniously with the predators they once loathed.

The Northern Jaguar Reserve is, without exaggerating, in the middle of nowhere.

I traveled there last month with Roberto Wolf, a veterinarian who leads the Northern Jaguar Project (NJP), an American nonprofit that oversees the refuge. After crossing the border south of Tucson, we drove another four hours or so to a charming ranch town called Sahuaripa, where the narrow streets were lined with brightly colored homes and full of stray dogs.

From there it was another few hours on to the reserve, largely on rugged dirt roads. (I felt like we were in one of those car commercials for all-terrain vehicles that are only useful in this exact scenario.)

Some time after entering the reserve we stopped by a log on the side of the road. It was covered in scratch marks, like the arm of a couch in a home filled with cats. That was the work of a mountain lion marking its territory, said Gómez, who met us in the park. He pointed out a motion camera nearby that had previously captured the behavior. 

Right before arriving at our campsite, a skunk ran across the front of the car, did a handstand, and then disappeared into the scrub. 

The next morning, which was cloudless and crisp, we hiked to a place called La Hielería — the spot where the trail cam had recently spotted El Guapo. Large winged shadows crossed our paths, cast by vultures hunting for carcasses. 

La Hielería, once part of a cattle ranch, has an important place in cat conservation. In the late 1990s, when jaguars were reappearing in the US, a team of researchers began exploring northern Mexico to find out where they were coming from. As part of that work, a biologist named Gustavo Pablo Lorenzana Piña set up a motion camera by a stream bed in La Hielería. 

The camera captured, as expected, cow after cow after cow. But then, as Lorenzana kept clicking through, he saw it: a jaguar, “the undisputed ruler of the neotropical forests, captured in a beautiful shot with shrubs and cacti in the background,” he said. 

The image, taken in early 2000, was the first ever photo of a live jaguar in Sonora. It was a female, later named Gus, in honor of Gustavo.

Her story ended — as most other jaguar tales do — at the hands of humans. The animal was pursued and killed for allegedly harming cattle, Lorenzana told me. 

Although it's technically illegal to kill jaguars in Mexico, hunting them for real or perceived harm to livestock was once a common practice. And it's still a threat today. In the late 20th century, at least five animals were killed on average per year in the state, according to the book Borderland Jaguars by David Brown and NJP co-founder Carlos López González.

One man I met, in his 70s, told me he'd killed six jaguars on a ranch that is now part of the reserve. (He'd typically use dogs to track down the cats and chase them into a cave or a tree. Then he'd shoot them.) Ranch owners would pay around 5,000 Mexican pesos — worth around $260 in today's US dollars, and nearly double that in the early 2000s — per slain jaguar. 

Jaguars do occasionally kill calves, though they prefer to feed on wild prey, such as deer or javelina, a small, fierce peccary that looks like a pig. In Sonora, jaguars and pumas might each kill a few calves per year, which typically amounts to only a fraction of a rancher's production.

While Gus was on the losing side of encounters between ranchers and cats, she left a lasting conservation legacy. By showing up on a trail cam in La Hielería, she helped prove that Sonora was home to a breeding population of jaguars. That spurred an effort to buy up ranches — including the one comprising La Hielería — and turn them into a reserve. NJP purchased its first ranch in 2003, and has since added several more. 

Together they cover more than 56,000 acres. 

Today the Northern Jaguar Reserve has a small yet healthy population of five or six jaguars, according to Carmina Gutiérrez González, a biologist at NJP. Motion cameras have spotted another 10 or so jaguars passing through the region, said Gutiérrez, who identifies individuals by their unique patterns of spots. 

After seeing El Guapo on the camera in La Hielería I wandered down the dry stream bed, where I stumbled upon a pile of feces. Jaguar feces, Gómez suspected. I've never been so excited to find a pile of shit in my life. 

People like Gómez who have spent more than a decade in the reserve have never seen jaguars face to face. My chance was close to zero. So poop? I'll take it.

The reserve is essential though insufficient — it's relatively small, covering less than 3 percent of the area of Yellowstone, for example. Jaguars in Sonora, meanwhile, have incredibly large home ranges, and can travel as much as 10 miles a day, Gómez said. 

Protecting them in one small area isn't enough in a region where hunting still occurs. So the Northern Jaguar Project had came up with another solution.

One morning, after a few nights in the reserve, we drove to a cattle ranch just beyond the boundary. We parked our dusty 4Runner next to a handful of cows and their calves, who froze and stared at us as if they had never seen humans before. 

A rancher named Uriel Villarreal Peña, who owns the property, came out to greet us, trailed by two dogs. As we sat around his outdoor table, under the shade of a tin roof, he told us he owns a little more than 100 cattle — each worth several hundred dollars — that he sells in Sahuaripa to be exported to the US.

For more than a decade, Villarreal, who wore a ball cap, jeans, and a button-down shirt, has been part of a program called Viviendo con Felinos. The program, launched by NJP in 2007, works with ranchers to place motion cameras on their land. When those cameras detect a wild cat — a jaguar, puma, ocelot, or bobcat — the nonprofit pays the rancher from a pool of funds they've raised from donors. The idea, Wolf told me, is “to make living wild animals more valuable than dead ones.”

Photos of jaguars are worth 5,000 pesos each (~$260), which is similar to what hunters might make for killing them. Photos of ocelots earn 1,500 pesos (~$78), pumas 1,000 pesos (~$52), and bobcats 5,000 pesos (~$26). Each rancher can earn a max of 20,000 pesos (~$1,038) a month for their photos — more than double the minimum monthly wage in Mexico. By joining Viviendo con Felinos, ranchers also agree not to kill any wild animals on their ranch, including deer and javelina. 

(Mexico has another, unrelated program run by its national livestock confederation that partially reimburses ranchers for cattle killed by wild predators. Ranchers complain that these funds, which are similarly meant to reduce hunting, are hard to access and inadequate.)

Villarreal told me he joined the NJP program partly for the money. Cat photos taken on his ranch earn him a few thousand dollars each year, he said, which amounts to about 10 to 15 percent of his annual income from the ranch. 

But he also just likes jaguars. “I'm interested in seeing animals, in preserving animals because they look pretty,” he said. 

It helps that jaguars haven't caused him many problems. When he was young, Villarreal thought wild cats were bad because they ate cattle, a rancher's livelihood. But over time he learned that predators will avoid calves as long as they have plenty of deer and javelina to eat. 

After sampling a bit of Villarreal's homemade Bacanora — an agave-based liquor, similar to mezcal; my job is hard, I swear! — he took us to see one of his motion cameras. It was “nearby,” though getting there involved a short drive, a half-hour hike in the sun, and a run-in with a road runner, a manic-looking ground bird that always seems to be in a rush.

Strapped to a wooden post, the camera was plastic, colored in camo, and roughly the size of a brick. We opened it up and clicked through the recent photos. Me approaching. Rabbit. Deer. Fox. A raccoon-like creature called a ringtail. Coati. Ocelot. Javelina. Javelina. Javelina. Javelina. Javelina.

And more javelina. 

I asked Villarreal what he thinks when he sees a wild cat on the camera. “1,500!” he joked, referring to the money in Mexican pesos he earns from each picture of an ocelot. He then added, more seriously: “It feels good to be able to say that they do exist.”

To date, 21 ranchers near the reserve have joined Viviendo con Felinos. And together, their land comprises 126,000 acres — an area more than twice the size of the actual reserve. The program has in effect expanded the area across which jaguars and their prey are protected. What's more, it's so popular among ranchers that there's actually an informal waitlist to join, Wolf said. 

NJP has been slowly growing the program, but adding more ranches — and all of the photos they may take — is expensive, Wolf noted. Between fall 2023 and fall 2024, NJP spent well over $100,000 on photo awards alone. That doesn't include staff time or the cost of cameras, which run around $150 each. And those cameras often need to be replaced because, of all things, woodpeckers occasionally hammer out the lenses and sensors, Gómez told me.

Viviendo con Felinos has given jaguars in Sonora more space to roam, and that alone is huge. 

But these iconic animals are also benefiting from a more fundamental shift in the region — a shift in its culture and customs. 

After our visit with Villarreal, we stopped at his neighbor's property, a large ranch owned by Agustín Hurtado Aguayo. Hurtado, now in his 80s, is the former president of the state's livestock association and a sizable figure in Sonora's ranching community. 

Several years ago, “I hated felines,” he told me at his home in the city of Hermosillo, the capital of Sonora, a few hours west of Sahuaripa. Cowboy hats and a pair of bull horns hung from the wall. “I had a very bad image of them,” Hurtado said. 

Hunting wild cats was a practice that older generations passed on, he said, and it stemmed from the belief that cats hurt production. “That's the training we had,” he told me. It was also normal for cowboys to hunt and eat deer, he said, which diminished an important food source for predators.

After Villarreal joined Viviendo con Felinos, Hurtado grew curious about the program. He liked the cat photos from his neighbor's ranch. “When I began to see photos from the cameras, I began to appreciate the animals,” he said, showing me his iPhone wallpaper of a mountain lion. “Little by little, my vision of wild cats began to change.”

Hurtado, who later also joined the program, realized that by limiting the number of cattle on his ranch, his cows would be healthier and there'd be more grass left over for deer. If he had more deer — and his workers refrained from hunting them — wild cats would kill fewer of his animals. 

These ideas are becoming increasingly common among ranchers in Sonora who have joined the program.

“If we as ranchers or as owners of property preserve the normal food chain, we have no problem,” said Jose de la Cruz Coronado Aguayo, another rancher in Viviendo con Felinos. 

There are other ways, too, to protect cattle from predators, such as by making sure calves don't roam the mountains alone. In other regions of the world, installing predator deterrents, such as electric fences, alarms, and flashing lights, is also effective in preventing predation. 

“Cats can really coexist with livestock,” Hurtado told me.

While it's clear how photos of jaguars might make someone fall in love with wild cats, that doesn't explain how ranchers like Hurtado learned how to farm in such a way that protects both felines and cattle. Wolf, of NJP, says it often comes down to individual experiences. Ranchers learn over time that by leaving deer alone or creating new water sources for animals, fewer livestock go missing. What's also crucial, he said, is that by earning money for photos of cats, people in the program become more tolerant of their presence — and more open to compromise and finding ways to live with them. 

Before we left his home, Hurtado took out his laptop and showed us photos from the motion cameras on his ranch. They were spectacular: a mountain lion, close to the camera and wearing a look of surprise. An ocelot with what looks like a mouse in its mouth. And several jaguars, including the image below, taken in 2023 — which he had set as his desktop background. 

Not everyone in Sonora suddenly loves cats. Ranchers still blame jaguars when their calves disappear or turn up dead. And some jaguars are still killed discreetly. One rancher who's not part of Viviendo con Felinos told me that since November he's lost more than a dozen of his calves, and he suspects that wild cats are behind the damage. He says the reserve should be fenced in for the benefit of ranchers. (There's no evidence that mountain lions or jaguars killed his calves, Wolf said.)

Tension in the region boiled over earlier this year, when a mountain lion apparently entered the house where a ranch worker was staying and attacked his dog. The worker, a man named Ricardo Vazquez Paredes, says he hit the cat with a pipe and the lion ran away, but not before injuring his dog, Blaki. While Wolf and some of the other ranchers I spoke to suspect his account might be exaggerated — it's rare for mountain lions to go near human dwellings — the story raised concerns around Sahuaripa about jaguars and efforts to protect them. 

Climate change might also worsen conflict in the region. Ranchers I spoke to say Sonora is getting drier, meaning there will be less and less grass for cattle — and for animals like deer that wild cats eat. That could make cows weaker and more likely to starve and jaguars hungrier and more likely to attack. Research suggests that jaguars kill more calves when it's dry. 

In 2023, a rancher in Viviendo con Felinos named Diego Ezrre Romero lost a calf to a jaguar. “The most critical thing on my ranch is water,” Ezrre told me. “There are few deer because of the conditions.”

This is to say: Conflict in Sonora isn't about to disappear altogether. 

Yet Viviendo con Felinos appears to be helping. Along with NJP's other efforts to engage the community — education programs, for example, and painting murals that depict the iconic cats in Sahuaripa and other towns — the group is making ranchers in jaguar territory more tolerant to cats. And thanks to payments, more tolerant to losses that they may cause. 

“Without them [NJP] there wouldn't even be a jaguar here right now,” said Fausto Lorenzo, a rancher near Sahuaripa who's not affiliated with the reserve. “All the ranchers would have killed them because that was the custom.”

From Hurtado's home in Hermosillo, we drove back toward Arizona. The highway cut through fields of saguaro cactuses. Dust devils spun in the distance, moving like flying whirlpools across the scrubland.

The success that NJP has had in Mexico ultimately bodes well for efforts to restore jaguars to the US. The number of jaguars in the reserve is stable, Gutiérrez says, but motion cameras suggest that year-over-year more individuals are passing through the region. That's more individuals that could potentially spill into the US.

One big problem, however, remains. 

As we neared the US border, the wall came into focus. It was metal and brown and rose 18 feet above the desert. Now stretching hundreds of miles across the Southwest, the wall has made the border largely impassive to wildlife — including jaguars. And it's still expanding. The Trump administration is now planning to complete one of the last unwalled sections of the border, a 25-mile stretch in the San Rafael Valley, about 150 miles northwest of the refuge, where jaguars have crossed into the US. 

The future for Sonora's jaguars appears promising regardless of whether Trump finishes his wall. NJP and other organizations have given these animals more space to live and helped lessen the threats they face. 

The real loss will be felt in the US. And not just among environmentalists and other wildcat advocates. Jaguars have lived in the US long before any of us. They're part of the country's nature heritage — of the ecosystems that are truly American — and their absence leaves our landscapes impaired. Ranchers in Sonora teach us that we can live alongside the continent's great predators. We just have to choose to.

The US president had the means to pressure Putin on Ukraine and didn't. Now it's the Old World's time to choose.

US President Donald Trump.

It's reasonable to be disappointed or worried — even disgusted — by the outcome of Donald Trump's phone call with Vladimir Putin this week but not surprised. The US president didn't fail to end this war, because he never tried.His focus was from day one to achieve a reset with Russia that would deliver an economic bounty to the US. American participation in the war was an obstacle to be removed before that could happen, and doing so via a peace settlement — rather than Ukraine's abandonment — was a better look. It wasn't, however, essential.  “This was a European situation, and should have remained a European situation,” Trump said on Monday. So, with that cleared up, what now?

First, unless Congress forces Trump's hand, he can leave the long, thankless task of mediating a peace settlement to the pope, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan or whomever wants to take it on. In the meantime, he can focus on making money.From Moscow's point of view, this could hardly have ended better. Putin has made a vague new offer to begin direct talks with Ukraine and set his demands out in a memorandum. We can take a good guess at what that will include, because the Kremlin has repeated its conditions for peace many times. Now that Trump has left the building, Putin has less incentive than ever to reduce them: Ukraine would have to hand over unconquered as well as occupied areas of territory that Russia has formally annexed, forswear any ties to NATO and demobilize most of its armed forces.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday outlined new regulatory guidance for future Covid-19 vaccine boosters, setting stricter approval standards for healthy Americans. 

The agency said it wants to see new clinical trials showing Covid shots are still safe and effective before approving them for healthy adults and children, a costly new requirement for pharmaceutical companies that could limit who gets new jabs each year. Previously, the FDA typically approved updated Covid shots for all Americans each year based on simple tests that show they trigger a strong enough antibody response.

The FDA recommended different standards of evidence for approval based on patients' risk of getting severely sick from Covid, according to a paper published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The paper's authors are FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and Vinay Prasad, an outspoken critic of the pharmaceutical industry who was appointed to lead the agency's division that oversees vaccines.

""The FDA's new Covid-19 philosophy represents a balance of regulatory flexibility and a commitment to gold-standard science,"" the agency said in the paper. ""The FDA will approve vaccines for high-risk persons and, at the same time, demand robust, gold-standard data on persons at low risk.""

The new guidance comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, overhauls the nation's health agencies and U.S. immunization policy.

For adults 65 and older, and for people as young as 6 months who have certain underlying health conditions, the FDA said it will accept immunogenicity data — which shows a vaccine generates a strong immune response — as enough to determine that a shot's benefits outweigh its risks. The FDA estimates that 100 to 200 million Americans have conditions that put them at high risk of severe illness, including obesity and mental health conditions such as depression.

But for healthy people between 6 months and 64 years old who don't have risk factors, the FDA plans to require stronger evidence for vaccines from randomized, controlled trials. The agency said these studies must show actual clinical outcomes, such as fewer infections or hospitalizations, before it will grant full approval of a shot. 

""Our policy also balances the need for evidence,"" Makary and Prasad wrote. ""We simply don't knowwhether a healthy 52-year-old woman with a normal BMI who has had Covid-19 three times and has received six previous doses of a Covid-19 vaccine will benefit from the seventh dose.""

The FDA said that when it approves a Covid vaccine for high-risk people, it will encourage manufacturers to conduct randomized, controlled clinical trials in healthy adults as part of their post-marketing commitment for the shot.

Makary and Prasad argued that the nation's ""one-size-fits-all"" Covid vaccine policy approach, which recommends annual shots for all Americans above six months old, is outdated and no longer in line with other countries. All other high-income nations limit vaccine recommendations to older adults or those at high risk for severe illness due to Covid, they said. 

They said the benefit of repeat vaccinations is ""uncertain,"" particularly among low-risk patients who have developed some immune protection through previous shots, infections or both. Makary and Prasad said many Americans and health-care providers ""remain unconvinced"" of that benefit, pointing to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on falling vaccination rates in the U.S. for annual Covid boosters. 

They cited CDC data that indicates that for the past two seasons, fewer than 25% of Americans have received a Covid-19 shot, including fewer than 10% of kids and fewer than 50% of adults over the age of 75. Less than one-third of health-care workers received updated Covid boosters in the 2023 to 2024 season, they said, citing CDC data.

They also suggested that broad Covid vaccine recommendations each year have contributed to declining trust in vaccination, including in the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Still, Makary and Prasad called MMR vaccines ""clearly established as safe and highly effective.""

Makary and Prasad will further address the new framework during a virtual town hall on Tuesday at 1 p.m. ET.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned House Republicans, ""Don't f--- around with Medicaid,"" as he pressed them during a closed-door meeting to pass a major tax bill, a source told CNBC.

Trump's blunt message came during a visit to Capitol Hill.

Movement on the tax bill has been hampered by a small number of Trump's fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives, including a group that wants cuts to the massive Medicaid health-care coverage program, which covers primarily low-income people.

Those Republicans also want work requirements added to the eligibility requirements for Medicaid.

Critics say work requirements would create a bureaucratic nightmare, forcing the government to try to verify and track the employment status and job searching efforts of tens of millions of people.

Medicaid, which is jointly financed by the federal government and individual states, and the smaller Children's Health Insurance Program, cover nearly 80 million Americans.

A tracking poll in April by the health policy research group KFF found that 61% of Americans oppose major cuts to staff and spending at federal health agencies.

Other lawmakers who have been stumbling blocks to passing the bill include Republicans from New York and California who want even higher increases to a proposed hike in the deduction for state and local taxes, and others who want cuts to the federal deficit from the bill.

""Let it go,"" Trump told members of the so-called SALT Caucus, according to three lawmakers who were in the meeting, NBC News reported. 

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., hopes to pass the bill before the upcoming Memorial Day weekend.

In this article

Elon Musk on Tuesday said he plans to spend ""a lot less"" on political donations in the future, signaling a change in attitude from President Donald Trump's top campaign backer.

Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and the head of the government-slashing initiative DOGE, spent more than $250 million helping Trump win a second White House term.

But when asked at the Qatar Economic Forum if he will continue spending at that level in upcoming elections, Musk said he would not.

""I think, in terms of political spending, I'm going to do a lot less in the future,"" Musk said.

When asked why, he said, ""I think I've done enough.""

But Musk, the world's richest man, said he may change his mind at some point. 

""Well, if I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,"" he said.

""I do not currently see a reason,"" he added.

Musk is set to speak again at 2 p.m. ET with CNBC's David Faber.

The remarks in Doha likely come as an unpleasant surprise to Republicans running for reelection in 2026.

On top of his Trump-related donations, Musk spent more than $19 million in the final weeks of the 2024 election cycle to help Republicans win narrow majorities in Congress.

His super political action committee, America PAC, was also a top outside spender in this year's high-profile election for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court that ultimately determined the court's ideological majority.

Musk-linked groups reportedly dropped more than $13 million in the lead-up to that April 1 race, which his preferred candidate lost.

Musk has been a major presence in Washington, D.C., since Trump's electoral victory, appearing regularly by the president's side and making himself highly visible as the face of DOGE, the group working to rapidly dismantle a slew of government agencies and projects.

But this increased visibility has taken a toll on the billionaire and his companies.

Musk's controversial actions and views — many of which he has aired on his social media platform X — coupled with his massive influence in the White House, have proven unpopular with the majority of Americans.

Polls show that public opinion of Musk, his companies and their products have all fallen sharply since January.

That shift coincided with a decline in Tesla's market value in the two months since Musk has entered the government, though its shares have recently rebounded. Tesla cars and showrooms have also emerged as targets for vandalism and arson.

Musk has previously signaled he plans to turn his focus back to his businesses. His time spent running DOGE will ""significantly"" drop starting this month, he told analysts in April on Tesla's quarterly earnings call.

Musk has recently fallen far out of the spotlight in D.C., Politico reported Monday.

But his apparent public pullback from politics does not mean he is leaving the sphere entirely, a Musk advisor told NBC News later Tuesday.

""Musk scaling back his public profile does not diminish his influence. I think it can actually sharpen it,"" the person said. ""He can still quietly fund stuff and support stuff he believes in, causes he believes in, but does not create unnecessary noise. These midterms will be about message discipline and a focus on the economy, not fights on X.""

In this article

Levi Strauss has agreed to sell Dockers to brand management firm Authentic Brands Group for $311 million, the companies announced Tuesday. 

Under the terms of the deal, Authentic will own Dockers' intellectual property while Centric Brands will take on operations, handling manufacturing, sourcing and distribution. Under the brand management business model, Levi's stands to make up to $391 million in future years based on how well Dockers performs under the Authentic umbrella, which also includes Forever 21's intellectual property and brands like Reebok and Nautica.

""The Dockers transaction further aligns our portfolio with our strategic priorities, focusing on our direct-to-consumer first approach, growing our international presence and investing in opportunities across women's and denim lifestyle,"" Levi's CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement. ""After a robust process, we are confident that we maximized the value of the business and that Authentic is the right organization to usher in the next chapter of growth for the Dockers brand."" 

In October, Levi's announced it was considering selling Dockers as it looked to focus on growing its namesake line and its athleisure brand, Beyond Yoga. Levi's created Dockers in 1986 as a hedge against denim and to offer consumers an alternative: khakis. The brand was hugely popular throughout the 1990s and 2000s, but khakis have since fallen out of fashion in the U.S., especially recently as denim makes another comeback. 

To grow Dockers, Levi's needed to offer more tops and bottoms, but the company is doing the same thing at its namesake banner and there was too much overlap between the two brands. Dockers' performance was also dragging down Levi's results and Gass, who took the helm of the company a little over a year ago, has been working to cut off extraneous businesses to fuel growth and focus on direct selling. 

In the three months ended March 2, Levi's reported $67 million in revenue related to Dockers. The figure isn't comparable to the year-ago period because Levi's only recently started breaking out the performance of each individual brand. 

While khakis have fallen out of favor in the U.S., Dockers is still popular abroad, which is what makes a brand management company a strategic fit, according to people who have seen Dockers' financials and spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were private. Firms like Authentic are skilled at rapidly licensing and deploying brands internationally.

In a press release, Authentic said it plans to ""unlock new opportunities"" for Dockers through its global network of 1,700 licensing partners. It said it is in active discussions with regional operators in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia to expand Dockers' existing businesses across those markets. 

""Few brands own a category the way Dockers does, yet still have so much room to grow,"" said Matt Maddox, president at Authentic. ""Its legacy in casualwear gives it a strong foundation, but the real opportunity lies in reimagining the brand for a new generation. Through our global platform and deep licensing network, we're committed to stewarding the brand into its next era of growth and relevance.""

In this article

Home Depot on Tuesday stuck by its full-year sales forecast as a top executive told CNBC the retailer doesn't plan to hike prices because of tariffs.

""Because of our scale, the great partnerships we have with our suppliers and productivity that we continue to drive in our business, we intend to generally maintain our current pricing levels across our portfolio,"" Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail told CNBC in an interview.

More than half of what the company sells comes from the U.S., he said. McPhail added that Home Depot and its suppliers have worked to diversify the source of the company's imports over the past several years, including by decreasing the share of purchases that come from China. By this time next year, no single country outside of the U.S. will represent more than 10% of the company's purchases, he said.

Home Depot's pricing strategy is at odds with Walmart, which said last week that it would have to raise prices as soon as late May to cover higher costs from tariffs. The decision to keep prices the same — at least for now — also comes as a sluggish housing market causes the retailer's sales to stagnate.

On an earnings call, McPhail said Home Depot has the scale and flexibility to manage higher tariffs, but added that keeping prices stable could also help its business.

""It's a great opportunity for us to take share, and it's a great opportunity for our suppliers to take share as well,"" he said.

McPhail made his comments as Home Depot posted results for the fiscal first quarter, after weeks in which a range of corporations have either revised or withdrawn their financial guidance due to President Donald Trump's rapidly changing tariffs. The home improvement retailer missed Wall Street's first-quarter earnings expectations for the first time since May 2020, but beat sales estimates.

The retailer is still waiting for dynamics that could drive stronger spending and bigger purchases.

On an earnings call, CEO Ted Decker said ""stubbornly high"" interest and mortgage rates and consumers' uncertainty about the economy have dampened home improvement spending.

""People are painting again and working in their yards and doing smaller projects, but just have not engaged in the larger projects,"" he said.

For the full year, Home Depot said it expects total sales to grow by 2.8% and comparable sales, which take out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and calendar differences, to rise about 1%. Its forecast is based on the continuation of a U.S. agreement to temporarily lower tariffs to 30% on imports from China and to 10% for many other countries.

Here's what Home Depot reported for the fiscal first quarter compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Shares of the company rose slightly in morning trading.

In the three-month period that ended May 4, Home Depot's net income was $3.43 billion, or $3.45 per share, compared with $3.60 billion, or $3.63 per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share exclude some costs, including the impact of depreciation from acquired intangible assets.

Spring is Home Depot's peak sales season — the Christmas of the home improvement world — as homeowners and contractors typically tackle more projects because of warmer and dryer weather. Yet even with that seasonal boost, the backdrop for Home Depot remains tough as more U.S. consumers put off home purchases or major renovation projects because of higher mortgage rates and costs of borrowing.

Sales growth has been muted. In the fiscal first quarter, comparable sales dropped 0.3% across the company. In the U.S., comparable sales increased 0.2% year over year.

That trend has been persistent, with the exception of the previous quarter. Home Depot snapped eight consecutive quarters of falling comparable sales in the fourth quarter. In that quarter, comparable sales increased 0.8% across the company.

Sales patterns improved as the quarter went on, McPhail said. Comparable sales declined 3.3% year over year in February, increased 1.3% from the prior-year period in March and rose 1.8% year over year in April, he said. 

He attributed negative sales results in February to poor weather. 

""We clawed our way back through the remainder of the quarter and had a great April, and we've seen the level of customer engagement that we saw in April continue into the first few weeks of May,"" he said.

As Home Depot stares down a more challenging housing backdrop, the company has chased more business from home professionals. It acquired SRS Distribution, a Texas-based company that sells supplies to roofing, pool and landscaping professionals, last year in a $18.25 billion deal.

Sales for Home Depot – including SRS – grew roughly 9% year over year in the first quarter from $36.42 billion in the year-ago quarter. About $2.6 billion of that year-over-year gain came from SRS' business, and a portion of sales growth came from new stores, McPhail told CNBC.

In the fiscal first quarter, customer transactions across Home Depot's website and stores rose 2.1% year over year. Average ticket, which measures the amount of spending on those store or website visits, was $90.71, just a few cents above the average in the year-ago quarter. 

Compared with other retailers, Home Depot caters to a more affluent U.S. consumer who tends to be employed and to have benefited from the sharp increase of property values since 2019, McPhail said. About 80% of its customers are homeowners, he said, and the home professionals who buy from Home Depot cater to homeowners who hire them to tackle projects from roofing and electrical work to a kitchen remodel.

""Our customer is healthy, and we think that's what has supported their level of engagement in home improvement,"" he said.

Even so, McPhail said that do-it-yourself customers are tending to defer bigger projects and engaging in smaller and spring-related projects. 

Home Depot saw a positive response to its spring Black Friday event and strong sales in the appliance, garden, plumbing and electrical departments, McPhail said. But he added sales have been softer in areas including kitchen countertops and bath – categories that tend to be purchased as part of pricier projects like renovations and remodels.

As of Monday's close, Home Depot's shares are down about 2% so far this year. That trails behind the S&P 500's gains of approximately 1% during the same period. Its shares closed at $379.38 on Monday, bringing its market value to about $377 billion.

Chinese-born crypto mogul Justin Sun says he's the top holder of the $TRUMP meme token and will be having dinner with President Donald Trump.

The dinner competition — a sweepstakes offering gala access to the sitting U.S. president — was open to anyone in the world willing to spend millions of dollars on a digital coin tied to Trump. 

On Thursday, the top 220 $TRUMP holders are invited to a dinner with the president at his Virginia golf club outside of Washington, D.C.

Late Monday night, Sun posted on X that he had secured the top spot in the $TRUMP token leaderboard, which earned him an invite to a dinner with the president, as well as a VIP reception for the top 25 holders.

""Honored to support @POTUS and grateful for the invitation from @GetTrumpMemes to attend President Trump's Gala Dinner as his TOP fan!"" he wrote. ""As the top holder of $TRUMP, I'm excited to connect with everyone, talk crypto, and discuss the future of our industry.""

Sun now holds $18.6 million worth of the Trump-themed meme token, on top of the $75 million he previously poured into World Liberty Financial — a separate crypto venture that routes 75% of the platform's revenue directly to Trump-owned entities.

Altogether, Sun's stake in the Trump family's crypto empire now tops $93 million.

Born in China, Sun is the crypto entrepreneur behind the Tron blockchain and is in talks with the Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve civil fraud charges. 

His case was paused in February, shortly after investing tens of millions of dollars into World Liberty's WLFI token.

The $TRUMP coin rose in value by about 2% on Tuesday to $13.27, according to Coinmarketcap.com. That values the circulating supply at $2.65 billion, making it the 39th most valuable cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is the most valuable at $2.1 trillion.

Like with other meme coins, there's no underlying product. 

The project's website says the coins ""are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type."" 

The SEC issued guidance in February saying that most meme coins are not considered securities under U.S. federal law.

Watchdog group Accountable.US referred to the moment as seeing ""corruption unfold in real time"" and renewed warnings that the $TRUMP token competition is opening backdoor access to foreign and corporate actors with little oversight and major stakes in Trump-linked assets.

""This dubious situation perfectly sums up why this $TRUMP coin competition was always going to become a magnet for foreign influence, unprecedented self-dealing and next level swampiness,"" said Tony Carrk, executive director of Accountable.US.

The nature of the pseudonymous wallets raises questions about the true identities and motivations of the token's largest holders.

Documents from blockchain analytics firm Inca Digital that were reviewed by CNBC show where the top 275 $TRUMP token holders send and receive the token. Many are heavily tied to international exchanges like Binance that don't service U.S. customers, an indication that they're likely not U.S. citizens.

An analysis by Bloomberg revealed that 19 of the top 25 wallets are almost certainly owned by individuals operating outside the U.S.

The leaderboard — now closed — captured an extraordinary concentration of wealth and influence behind a volatile asset launched just days before the inauguration. 

More than $5.2 billion in realized gains have flowed to the top-performing wallets, while a larger number of addresses — over 590,000 — have collectively lost $3.9 billion, according to Inca Digital.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., the ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations, warned that the Trump family's growing crypto holdings may serve as a backdoor for foreign and corporate interests seeking access to the president.

""President Trump's financial entanglements to the $TRUMP coin, as well as the attempted use of the White House to host competitions to prop up the value of $TRUMP, represents an unprecedented, pay-to-play scheme to provide access to the Presidency to the highest bidder,"" Blumenthal wrote.

As a pediatrician, I spend a lot of time engaging with families about nutrition. My philosophy is simple: If you empower a child to embrace healthy eating habits early on, they are more likely to carry these positive behaviors into adulthood. 

Early intervention can be transformative and help substantially reduce their long-term risk of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and even certain types of cancer.

Many parents already know the importance of feeding kids vegetables and limiting added sugar. We often discuss ""eating the rainbow,"" emphasizing the need for a diverse range of colorful fruits and vegetables. Parents frequently prioritize dark leafy greens, antioxidant-rich blueberries and healthy-fat-packed avocados. 

However, there's one nutritional powerhouse that often gets overlooked: beans. Here's why I wish more parents fed this underrated superfood to their kids. 

Beans, in all their varied forms, are an exceptional source of plant-based protein. Many bean varieties contain all the essential amino acids that are vital for supporting a child's energy, growth and active lifestyle. 

Beans are also loaded with both soluble and insoluble fiber, a duo that's a game-changer for digestive health. Insoluble fiber promotes regular bowel movements, preventing constipation and keeping things moving smoothly. Soluble fiber contributes to that feeling of fullness and satiety after a meal, which can be helpful in managing appetite and preventing overeating. 

Soluble fiber also plays a role in lowering LDL, or ""bad"" cholesterol levels, and helps to stabilize blood sugar fluctuations after meals, preventing those dreaded energy crashes.

Beans are naturally fortified with an impressive array of essential vitamins and minerals. 

They are also a fantastic source of folate, which is vital for cell growth and development, as well as iron, which is crucial for carrying oxygen throughout the body. 

Plus, they're packed with magnesium for nerve and muscle function, and a range of B vitamins that support energy production and brain health.

Soybeans in particular have a good amount of healthy fats in them, like omega 3 and omega 6 fats that support heart and brain health. 

Beyond their nutritional profile, beans offer practical advantages. They are very affordable, making them accessible to families on any budget. Their long shelf life means you can stock up and always have a healthy meal option on hand. 

Additionally, incorporating beans into our diets is an environmentally-friendly choice. They have a lower carbon footprint compared to many animal protein sources, contributing to a more sustainable food system.

Of course, all the nutritional knowledge in the world won't make a difference if kids refuse to eat what's offered. This is where the magic of beans truly shines. 

I've found that many children genuinely enjoy the taste and texture of beans, and they are remarkably easy to prepare in various kid-friendly ways.

For younger children or more picky eaters, start with something simple and approachable, like steaming edamame (young soybeans) or adding black beans to a cheesy quesadilla. I've even found success with black bean-based brownies, a surprisingly delicious and nutritious treat. 

For more adventurous eaters, consider introducing lentil soups, flavorful bean chili or stews. The versatility of beans makes them easy to incorporate into a wide range of dishes, ensuring there's a bean recipe out there for everyone.

The intense trade war with the U.S. has left lasting scars on Chinese exporters with many looking to diversify away from the U.S., despite the temporary tariff reprieves, a private survey found.

Based on a poll of 4,500 exporters across several major economies, trade insurer Allianz Trade found that 95% of Chinese exporters surveyed are planning on, if not already, doubling down on exporting to markets outside the U.S. for their goods.

The U.S.-China ""decoupling"" remains a likely scenario over the medium term, the survey said, as Chinese exporters look to pivot away from the U.S. and American firms accelerate efforts to shift production out of China.

An increasing number of firms surveyed are expecting a dent on export turnover this year due to the double-digit U.S. tariffs, the report said.

Even after the temporary tariff reduction following Beijing-Washington's deal in Switzerland earlier this month, the U.S. trade-weighted tariff rate on Chinese goods remained at 39%, well above the 13% rate applied before the second Trump administration, according to Allianz Trade estimates.

The rapid de-escalation of the tariff spat has led to a large spike in U.S.-bound shipments as exporters front-load orders during the 90-day grace period, pushing up freight rates.

Chinese exporters in the coastal city of Ningbo are undeterred by the truce, and sticking with their plans to ""go global"", said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at Economist Intelligence Unit.

In a recent report on a field visit to the city, which hosts China's second largest port by cargo handled after Shanghai, Xu said Southeast Asia remained the top choice among local businesses seeking to move production overseas.

For Southeast Asia, companies show growing interests in setting up production in Indonesia, Xu said. On the other hand, perception was mixed about Vietnam, with concerns over rising costs weighing against an attractive labor force.

While the U.S. has hammered out trade deals with China and the U.K, talks with other long trading partners seem to have stalled.

Allianz Trade points out a sobering reality that global exports could see a loss of $305 billion this year on the back of the widespread trade conflicts.

In comparison, global trade hit a record $33 trillion last year, according to the United Nations Trade and Development.

U.S. stocks mostly eked out slim gains overnight, as investors look past Moody's downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating last Friday. This extends the markets' rally from last week on the U.S.-China's temporary trade truce.

But there are dark clouds on the horizon. Moody's downgrade continues to grip the bond market with the 30-year Treasury yield surging past 5% Monday, hitting levels not seen since November 2023. Bridgewater Associates founder and billionaire Ray Dalio warned that the U.S.'s lower sovereign credit rating understates the threat to U.S. Treasurys, saying the credit agency isn't taking into account the risk of the federal government simply printing money to pay its debt. 

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also cautioned that markets are too complacent on tariffs, and expects S&P 500 earnings growth to collapse as companies pull or lower guidance amid trade policy uncertainty.

On the trade negotiations front, China accused the U.S. of undermining the two countries' preliminary trade agreement, after the U.S. issued an industry warning against using Chinese chips that singled out Huawei. Beijing has demanded that the U.S. President Donald Trump administration ""correct its mistakes,"" a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce told a reporter, calling the U.S. Commerce Department's guidance ""discriminatory"" and ""market distorting.""

United States bond yields spikeU.S. Treasury yields were off their highs Monday afternoon but remained elevated after Moody's downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating. The 30-year Treasury yield hit a high around 5.03%, reaching levels not seen since November 2023.

China cuts key lending rate for the first time in 7 monthsChina trimmed its loan prime rates by 10 basis points Tuesday on a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions in a bid to boost growth. The 1-year LPR influences corporate and most household loans in China, while the 5-year LPR serves as a benchmark for mortgage rates.

U.S. markets eke out slim gainsThe S&P 500 rose slightly Monday as investors looked past Moody's downgrade of the United States' credit rating. The benchmark added 0.09% to mark its sixth consecutive winning session. The Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.02%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 137.33 points, or 0.32%, due in part to UnitedHealth's stock rebounding by an 8% jump after a recent bout of hard selling. Asia-Pacific markets rose as China cut its key lending rates to boost growth. Mainland China's CSI 300 added 0.48% at 1:43 p.m. Singapore time. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index climbed 1.3% and Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.23%.

Trump's tariffs exacerbate customs fraudThe U.S.'s new tariffs have pushed Chinese exporters to increasingly commit an existing shipping fraud, which works by significantly understating the value of goods or mislabeling them, often both. Shipments are then routed through shell companies that will fail to pay tariffs, default and cease operation. Experts warn that U.S. businesses are underestimating civil and criminal risks by partnering with such exporters.

[PRO] BlackRock's Rick Rieder says he's found the 'sweet spot' in bonds right now even as the market flinchesRick Rieder, Blackrock's chief investment officer, said he has found a ""sweet spot"" to invest in the bond market that comes with high returns and is high in quality. This specific segment trades rich since it gets crossover buyers from investment grade, he explained. Read more about his strategy here.

Trump wants a 'one-stop shopping' deal with South Korea on trade and defense, but there is a cost

South Korea is trying to strike a deal to escape the U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, but the latter is ""shopping"" for more. He has pitched to share the costs of hosting U.S. troops in the allied country — bundling negotiations on trade, tariffs, and defense cost-sharing into a single comprehensive deal.

Seoul has been sharing defense costs since 1991 in three areas, namely logistics, local labor, and military construction. In October 2024, Seoul agreed to raise its contribution for hosting U.S. troops by 8.3% in 2026, to 1.52 trillion won ($1.13 billion).

While South Korean officials have reportedly said that defense payments are off the table, the country's two leading presidential candidates, Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo, have hinted that they are open to discussing a defense cost-sharing agreement.

However, such a transactional approach will damage the U.S.'s credibility, Hoshik Nam, assistant professor at the Department of Sociology and Political Science at Jacksonville State University, said. ""In the long term, this position could reframe the U.S. as an isolated superpower.""

In this article

Shares of the world's largest battery manufacturer Contemporary Amperex Technology rose over 16% in their Hong Kong trading debut on Tuesday, as investors bet on the company's ability to ride the boom in electronic vehicles.

Shares closed trading at 306.2 Hong Kong dollars on the Hong Kong stock exchange, compared with the initial public offering price of HK$263 per share. 

CATL IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion) according to a company filing, reportedly making it the largest offering this year globally. CATL shares, which had opened lower on mainland China's Shenzhen stock exchange, reversed course to end the day up 1.15% at 263 Chinese yuan.

""I think that as the H [Hong Kong] shares continue to perform strongly, that will pull up the A [mainland China] shares,"" Neil Beveridge, senior research analyst at Bernstein, told CNBC's ""The China Connection.""

""For the H shares to be trading above the A shares just shows how exceptional the demand is for this company, particularly from global investors,"" he added.

CATL said in its Hong Kong filing that 90% of the funds raised will go toward building its upcoming factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients including Stellantis, BMW and Volkswagen.

""Europe is an exceptionally important market for CATL,"" said Beveridge, adding that the company's growth in China was going to slow over the coming years due to already high sales penetration. ""Europe's only at about 20-25% [sales] penetration, so there's still a lot of growth there to come,"" he added. 

The company's push into Europe coincided with global expansions from leading Chinese EV makers such as BYD. These efforts also come amid increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, which placed punitive tariffs on EVs made in China last year, citing unfair trade practices.

CATL also found itself in the crosshairs of U.S.-China trade earlier this year, with the Pentagon putting it on a watchlist in January over suspected links to China's military — allegations the company has rejected.

According to Bill Russo, founder and CEO of investment advisory firm Automobility, the watchlist designation, coupled with Trump's latest tariffs on China, may complicate the company's U.S.-related business.

However, the impact on its global ambitions will likely be limited unless broader multilateral restrictions follow, as CATL's core strategy remains focused on markets such as Europe and emerging regions, he said.

In March, CATL posted a 9.7% drop in its 2024 annual revenue, hit by intense competition in China's EV market that pressured the world's top battery producer. Still, the company's net profit went up by 15% year over year.

Demand for EVs in China, a critical market for CATL, gained momentum last year on the back of a combination of subsidies and consumer purchase incentives. EV sales in China surged to 11 million in 2024 — a 40% increase compared to the previous year, data from U.K. research firm Rho Motion showed.

""We're a big believer and investor in CATL in our global EV strategy. It's just phenomenal, it's a 'must own company,' in my opinion, along with BYD for investors in the space,"" said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at KraneShares.

Bank of America, China International Capital Corporation, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase were the joint lead managers for the Hong Kong offering.

Speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box Asia on Tuesday, Andy Maynard, managing director and head of equities at China Renaissance, said that CATL's IPO shows that investors still look to China to find quality plays despite recent trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.

""This is the world's largest new stock fundraising event this year, and it also brings the total amount of new stock fundraising in Hong Kong this year to over HK$60 billion, more than 6 times more than the same period last year,"" Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in a blog post on Sunday, according to a Google translation.

Sustainable energy management firm, (NYSE American: KULR), announced on Tuesday that it has increased its Bitcoin holdings to 800.3 BTC following an additional $9 million investment.

In a press release shared with CryptoNews, the firm said that this brings the company's total Bitcoin acquisitions to $78 million, with the latest tranche purchased at a weighted average price of $103,234 per BTC.

 has acquired 83.3 BTC for ~ 9 million To learn more about our acquistion and our Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, check out today's press release. — KULR Technology (@KULRTech) 

This move is part of KULR's broader Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, first announced on December 4, 2024, which allows for up to 90% of the company's surplus cash reserves to be allocated to Bitcoin.

The company said it sees this as a way to preserve and potentially enhance shareholder value in an inflationary economic environment.KULR Reports BTC Yield of 220.26%

Central to this strategy is KULR's use of “BTC Yield” as a key performance indicator (KPI). Year-to-date, the company reports a BTC Yield of 220.26%, demonstrating the growth in Bitcoin holdings relative to the company's fully diluted share count.

This metric provides insight into the effectiveness of KULR's treasury allocation model.

“BTC Yield offers a unique lens through which to evaluate how effectively we're leveraging digital assets to drive long-term value,” a company spokesperson stated. “It's a forward-thinking approach to corporate treasury management.”

However, KULR also cautions investors against viewing BTC Yield as a direct measure of operational or financial performance. It does not account for liabilities, nor is it designed to predict stock performance. Instead, it serves as a supplemental tool for understanding the growth of digital asset holdings in relation to share dilution.

Despite the volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies, KULR said it remains committed to disciplined financial management and long-term strategic planning. The company urges investors to consider BTC Yield in conjunction with traditional financial statements and SEC filings.Firms Adding Bitcoin to Their Balance Sheets

KULR joins a growing list of companies that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy. This includes MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm and one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin.

On Monday, Nasdaq-listed Strategy also acquired more Bitcoin.

A new report from Standard Chartered says sovereign entities are increasingly gaining Bitcoin exposure through shares of Strategy (MSTR), supporting the bank's $500,000 BTC target by 2029.

Sovereign investment in Bitcoin is accelerating—just not always in the most direct way. In a new report, Standard Chartered Bank says indirect exposure via Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is quietly increasing among government entities, reinforcing the bank's long-standing price prediction that Bitcoin will reach $500,000 before President Donald Trump leaves office in 2029.

JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Standard Chartered says SEC 13F fillings support #Bitcoin reaching $500,000 by 2028 🚀 pic.twitter.com/MURg9bxLka

“The latest 13F data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) supports our core thesis that Bitcoin (BTC) will reach the $500,000 level before Trump leaves office as it attracts a wider range of institutional buyers,” wrote Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered's global head of digital assets research. “As more investors gain access to the asset and as volatility falls, we believe portfolios will migrate towards their optimal level from an underweight starting position in BTC.”

Q1 13F filings revealed a slowdown in direct bitcoin ETF buying—Wisconsin's state fund exited its entire 3,400 BTC-equivalent IBIT position—while government-linked purchases of MSTR shares were on the rise. Abu Dhabi's Mubadala, for instance, upped its IBIT exposure to 5,000 BTC equivalent, but Kendrick says the bigger story is elsewhere.

“We believe that in some cases, MSTR holdings by government entities reflect a desire to gain Bitcoin exposure where local regulations do not allow direct BTC holdings,” he said.

France and Saudi Arabia took first-time MSTR positions in Q1. Meanwhile, Norway's Government Pension Fund, the Swiss National Bank, and South Korea's public funds each added exposure equivalent to 700 BTC. U.S. retirement funds in states like California and New York added a combined 1,000 BTC equivalent via MSTR. Kendrick called the trend “very encouraging.”

“The quarterly 13F data is the best test of our thesis that BTC will attract new institutional buyer types as the market matures, helping the price reach our USD 500,000 level,” Kendrick said. “When institutions buy Bitcoin, prices tend to rise.”

SEC DATA BACKS BITCOIN $500K TARGET BY 2028: STANDARD CHARTEREDStandard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick says recent SEC 13F filings support a possible rise in Bitcoin to $500,000 by end-2028. While direct ETF holdings dipped in Q1, government entities boosted stakes in Strategy…

This isn't Kendrick's first bullish call. Last month, he admitted his prior $120K forecast for Q2 2025 was “too low,” citing surging inflows into U.S. spot BTC ETFs—totaling $5.3 billion over just three weeks. At the time, Kendrick revised his 2025 year-end target to $200,000.

Standard Chartered's latest analysis shows that Bitcoin's role in institutional portfolios is maturing beyond tech volatility correlation—now increasingly seen as a macro hedge. “It is now all about flows,” Kendrick said. “And flows are coming in many forms.”

It doesn't take a computer expert to understand Bitcoin. Bitcoin may seem complicated or risky, but embracing the leading digital asset can be the answer to reversing the chronic problems facing our state, such as population loss, brain drain and economic stagnation.

Michigan is at a crossroads. Jobs are disappearing, young people are leaving their families behind, and communities are struggling to stay afloat. Politicians continue to offer bailouts, short-term spending and unsustainable programs as solutions. The only way to reverse these downward trends is through innovation. Bitcoin provides a path to an innovation-based economy.

Let's clear up a common misconception: not all cryptocurrency is the same. Digital assets fall into two general categories — securities (think stocks) and commodities (think gold or oil). Bitcoin is the latter. But unlike any other commodity on Earth, Bitcoin is predictably and reliably scarce. Only 21 million Bitcoin units will ever exist, a cap hard coded into its programming. That scarcity, combined with its transparency and global nature, gives Bitcoin intrinsic value.

It's also backed by energy. In a world where time and energy are our most precious resources, Bitcoin offers a way to store both. It's not controlled by a government or corporation. It can't be manipulated by any central authority. And it operates on a network of more than 2,000 independent nodes across the globe, making it virtually impossible to counterfeit or alter.

Embracing Bitcoin is an antidote to scams in the crypto space. Bitcoin has weathered more than 15 years of scrutiny and attacks — from governments, banks, media and skeptics — and is still rising faster than ever before. The annualized return since Bitcoin's inception is more than 90%. The fears have been unfounded, and the Bitcoin network gets stronger as more people adopt the digital asset and become part of its ecosystem.

Bitcoin is also a tool to fight inflation. Unlike the dollar, which loses purchasing power annually due to Federal Reserve money printing, Bitcoin's supply is fixed. This scarcity makes Bitcoin a hedge against the kind of monetary manipulation that has left many Americans struggling to keep up with rising prices.

So, what can Michigan do? Plenty.

Michigan can follow the lead of New Hampshire, which just passed legislation to create a Bitcoin Reserve, allowing up to 5% of its $3.6 billion rainy day fund to be held in Bitcoin. That would currently allow them to purchase roughly 2,269 units of Bitcoin — an asset that has increased in value by over 500% in the past decade. If Michigan takes its $20 billion surplus and does the same, the state could not only protect its budget against dollar devaluation but also could potentially unlock millions in growth to reinvest in schools, roads and infrastructure.

Michigan can also make its tax policy competitive. Right now, outdated capital gains taxes and unclear regulations discourage tech firms and investors from choosing Michigan. Our state should be restructuring tax treatment for digital assets and incentivizing renewable-powered Bitcoin mining and blockchain companies to set up shop here. Other states are moving fast, and Michigan will be left behind if it does not quickly adopt forward-thinking policies.

The Michigan Bitcoin Trade Council (MiBTC) is working to make these ideas tangible for everyday citizens. The MiBTC's mission is to help policymakers and the public understand that Bitcoin is not just for day traders looking for a buck, crypto bros surfing the web or Silicon Valley techies. It is an instrument for people who want to see Michigan thrive again.

Michigan needs forward-thinking businesses that understand the long-term value of holding Bitcoin. The state needs local governments willing to explore blockchain-based transparency solutions. And most of all, it needs voters who are tired of the same old promises and ready to support bold, future-focused policies.

Bitcoin is not a magic-bullet solution for all of Michigan's problems, but it is certainly a powerful tool for achieving economic revival. Our state was the mecca for the second Industrial Revolution when the automobile industry was king. There is no reason why it cannot dominate the third Industrial Revolution by embracing Bitcoin and the tech industry to revitalize decaying industrial centers and create thousands of well-paying jobs as well as a better world.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday (May 19) that the bank now offers its clients access to bitcoin.

Dimon announced this at the bank's annual investor day, while reiterating his own skepticism about digital currency, CNBC reported Monday.

“We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon said, per the report. “We're not going to custody it. We're going to put it in statements for clients.”

Dimon added that he remains concerned about issues around bitcoin, such as money laundering, lack of clarity in terms of ownership and use in illicit activities, according to the report.

“I don't think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke,” Dimon said, per the report. “I defend your right to buy bitcoin.”

It was reported in December 2023 that Dimon had been a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies for some time and that he told a Senate Banking Committee hearing that if he had the power, he would shut down the entire industry.

While he criticized cryptocurrencies, he had different views on blockchain technology, and JPMorgan actively embraced that technology for various projects, including the development of its proprietary stablecoin, JPM Coin.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) provided new guidance March 28 saying that FDIC-supervised institutions can engage in crypto-related activities without receiving prior FDIC approval, provided they adequately manage the associated risks.

Previously, under guidance that the FDIC rescinded, the agency required prior notification of crypto-related activities.

“With today's action, the FDIC is turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years,” FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill said at the time in a press release. “I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards.”

Institutional adoption of digital assets like cryptocurrencies and tokenized securities is seen as inevitable, although risk remains an obstacle, PYMNTS reported May 13.

The new wave of adoption is being led by highly regulated institutions, which are grappling with the core question of risk across the blockchain.

XRP and Ethereum had been in a battle for the second spot for years until the former entered a bearish phase following the SEC's lawsuit.

With Bitcoin (BTC) securing its spot as the largest crypto asset by market cap, Ethereum (ETH) has also maintained the second spot for years. However, this dominance for first and second positions was not always the case.

Notably, while BTC has always remained the largest asset, the position of the second-largest cryptocurrency was once a constant battle between XRP and Ethereum, with both assets occasionally retaking and relinquishing this position for years. 

For context, before the launch of XRP and Ethereum, Litecoin secured the second spot among the largest crypto assets until October 2014, when XRP surpassed it to hold this position.

XRP maintained this spot, with Litecoin unable to catch up, until Ethereum outranked it in February 2016. CoinMarketCap's historical snapshot confirms that Ethereum soared to a market cap of $358.3 million in late February 2016, while XRP had a valuation of $276 million. 

Throughout 2016, Ethereum held the second spot, eventually closing the year with a valuation of over $600 million, over $400 million higher than XRP's $200 million valuation. 

However, things changed in December 2017 on the back of XRP's meteoric run. By December 31, 2017, XRP boasted a market cap of $89.12 billion, holding the second spot, while Ethereum, which had a market cap of $73.17 billion, was relegated to third.

Nonetheless, as XRP witnessed a massive correction, Ethereum retook the second spot. In 2018 alone, the two assets continuously reclaimed and lost this position, with XRP closing the year as the victor with a valuation of $15.07 billion, dwarfing Ethereum's $14.56 billion.

This battle slipped into 2019 and 2020, but Ethereum mostly maintained the second spot. However, following the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, XRP collapsed further, even relegating the third spot and slipping to as low as seventh in February 2021. 

In recent years, specifically in 2023 and 2024, XRP also struggled to even make it to the top 5. Even in October 2024, XRP languished in the seventh spot, with a market cap of $29.3 billion, ten times less than Ethereum's market cap of $301.7 billion at the time.

XRP's breakthrough materialized in November 2024 following the U.S. elections. By Dec. 8, 2024, the asset had recovered the third spot with a market cap of $148.98 billion. However, this was still $334 billion below Ethereum's market cap of $482 billion.

Interestingly, due to its greater resilience amid the market-wide bearish pressure that began in February 2025, XRP is now closer to overtaking Ethereum than it has been in years. Currently, XRP's market cap of $138 billion is $169 billion away from Ethereum's valuation of $307 billion.

For context, XRP only needs to rally to a price of $5.24 to overtake Ethereum in market cap. This would require a 122% increase from the current price of $2.36. With the SEC lawsuit now heading toward a definitive settlement, most believe XRP could eventually retake the second spot if it maintains its growth momentum.

Bitcoin and Ethereum investment products have seen significant inflows, with digital asset funds recording $785 million last week, marking the fifth consecutive week of positive inflows. Bitcoin attracted $557 million, while Ethereum saw $205 million, boosted by the Pectra upgrade and leadership changes. The year-to-date inflows for digital assets have now reached $7.5 billion, surpassing the previous peak set in early February.



Institutional interest in Bitcoin has surged, with Northeast Financial revealing a $7.2 million purchase, and Millennium Management increasing its holdings to $1.6 billion. Bank of America also disclosed an increase in its Bitcoin exposure in its Q1 13F filing. BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has been a dominant player, pulling in $305.9 million on a single day, with total net assets reaching $66.9 billion, representing about 3.2% of Bitcoin's market capitalization. Fidelity also made a significant move, purchasing $188 million worth of Bitcoin.



Ethereum has been highlighted as a standout performer, with Abraxas Capital accumulating 350,703 ETH worth $837 million since May 7, including a recent $115.3 million purchase. BlackRock also bought $13.1 million worth of Ethereum. The Realized Cap of Ethereum has surged by $3.8 billion since the Pectra upgrade, reversing a three-month downtrend.



Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen their assets under management reach $131.08 billion, with BlackRock's ETF holding 631,962 BTC valued at approximately $65 billion, representing nearly 3% of the total Bitcoin supply. The ETFs recorded $667.4 million in inflows on a single day, with Bitcoin trading above $100,000 for 12 consecutive days and reaching its highest weekly close in history. BlackRock's spot ETFs also purchased 2,870 BTC and 5,490 ETH on May 19, totaling roughly $318 million.

Société Générale's crypto arm, SG Forge, is reportedly preparing to launch a dollar-backed stablecoin on Ethereum, making it the first global banking group to issue a public stablecoin tied to the U.S. dollar.

SG Forge's dollar stablecoin would be publicly accessible on Ethereum, with additional support for Solana to follow. The launch is expected in the coming weeks, according to a report by French publication The Big Whale.

The move would expand SG Forge's footprint in the digital asset space following the 2023 debut of its euro stablecoin, EURCV.

The token would initially serve institutional investors, leveraging SG Forge's e-money license to operate legally across the European Union, according to the report.

The shift would come amid accelerating stablecoin adoption. World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance project backed by the family of U.S. President Donald Trump, has launched its own dollar-denominated stablecoin, USD1, which has been used to settle MGX's $2 billion investment in Binance.

Banks, according to BitGo's managing director of stablecoin Ben Reynolds, are exploring stablecoins in a bid to avoid being outpaced by cryptocurrency-native competitors. These financial institutions are needed to unlock the full potential of these tokens, PayPal's crypto head Jose Fernandez da Ponte said at Consensus 2025 in Toronto.

SG Forge's euro-denominated stablecoin, EURCV, currently has a market capitalization of around $46.5 million, far behind competitors including Circle's EURC token, whose market cap exceeds $237 million. Euro-denominated tokens represent a fraction of the $243 billion stablecoin market.

U.S. dollar stablecoins dominate the ecosystem, with Circle's USDC commanding a $60.6 billion market cap, behind the market leader USDT, Tether's flagship stablecoin with a $151.6 billion market cap.

SG Forge declined to comment.

SINGAPORE, May 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As mid-May unfolds, crypto market sentiment continues to rise. While major assets trend steadily upward, capital is beginning to rotate into fundamentally solid altcoins. In this edition of HTX DeepThink, Chloe (@ChloeTalk1) from HTX Research shares her macro outlook and strategic insights, with a spotlight on rotation opportunities across the SUI ecosystem and the emerging AttentionFi sector.

Macro Outlook: Rising Bullish Sentiment Amidst Steady Short-Term Uptrend

This week's U.S. economic calendar is light on major data releases. Market attention is primarily directed towards Federal Reserve officials' interpretations of recent commentary suggesting a possible single interest rate cut in 2025.

Analysis of options market data shows a prevailing bullish sentiment: the Call/Put open interest ratio has reached 1.55, accompanied by increasing premiums for call options. At the same time, short-term implied volatility (IV) has dropped to a new 18-month low of 35–40%.

In short: the market is experiencing ""euphoric sentiment amid calm volatility."" Under such conditions, Bitcoin could retest new highs within the next 30–45 days, targeting the $105K–$115K range. However, this mix of high sentiment and low volatility often conceals the build-up of excessive leverage. A sudden surge in IV or a meaningful drop below $100K could trigger a sharp deleveraging event.

Strategic Positioning: Capital Rotation into High-Quality Altcoins for Momentum Capture

From a capital allocation perspective, rotating a portion of capital into fundamentally strong and liquid altcoins may present an opportunity to capitalize on potential spillover momentum from Bitcoin's upward trajectory. This edition of HTX DeepThink highlights promising sectors and projects worthy of investor attention.

SUI Ecosystem: All-Time High Market Cap, Undervalued Core Project

The SUI chain has reached an all-time high in market cap, but its ecosystem projects have yet to follow with substantial gains. This opens a window for early positioning in undervalued ecosystem leaders. HTX has listed two standout projects within the SUI ecosystem: Haedal and Bluefin.

Given the rising attention on SUI's mainnet, Haedal and Bluefin appear to exhibit dual potential for valuation recovery and Beta-driven upside, which may warrant mid-term attention from market participants.

AttentionFi: Capitalizing on Bull Market User Acquisition Premium

New Web3 projects are launching rapidly, and the cost of user acquisition is soaring. In traditional channels like Telegram, Google, or Red Note, user acquisition cost (UAC) is calculated via ""traffic × conversion rate."" With CPCs at $0.5–1.0 and conversion rates around 10%, it can cost $5–10 to acquire a real, retained user.

Kaito offers a far more efficient ""attention engine."" Its API charges based on a combination of reputation score and meaningful engagement. As a result, project teams can acquire real users with 3–4x higher retention at just $2–3 per user—much lower than traditional channels. With this model, Kaito has grown rapidly, expanding from 30 to 120 integrated projects in the past three months, and quadrupling API call volume.

Meanwhile, $KAITO staking has surged to 19.7M tokens, and the protocol has cumulatively bought back and burned 3.7M tokens, creating a strong demand-supply mismatch and deflationary pressure that supports higher price ceilings.

On Base chain's IDO platform Virtuals, users who stake ≥5,000 $KAITO can earn Virgen Points to redeem IDO allocations. Several recent IDOs have seen 10–30x returns on day one, forming a lucrative loop: stake → points → arbitrage.

With the recent listing of $KAITO on HTX, its liquidity is expanding—and in a bull market where competition for user attention intensifies, Kaito's combination of low-cost, high-precision targeting and deflationary tokenomics makes it a promising asset to watch.

Crypto World News

May 20, 2025 by Vaigha Varghese 

The search for the best altcoins to buy is heating up as investors prepare for the next breakout phase in crypto. While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, attention is shifting toward emerging tokens that combine real-world applications with strong community interest. These altcoins are gaining momentum across trading platforms, forums, and early-stage presales.

Many of the most talked-about projects today are not just about hype. They're blending technologies like artificial intelligence, smart contracts, and utility-driven use cases that go beyond speculation. Investors are watching closely to see which tokens have the right mix of innovation, traction, and timing to grow in 2025.

One presale making waves is Dawgz AI, a meme-inspired Ethereum token designed around AI-powered tools and community interactions. As presales continue to attract early movers, coins like this are starting to capture attention for more than just their theme.

Altcoins are cryptocurrencies that operate outside of Bitcoin. Some support smart contracts while others focus on DeFi, storage, or AI-based tools. As markets look beyond BTC's long-standing dominance, altcoins are drawing interest from investors who want exposure to more functional crypto ecosystems. These tokens now represent a growing share of volume across major platforms like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, with many showing sharp price swings ahead of market cycles.

One of the main reasons altcoins are being watched in 2025 is their potential to move faster than BTC. Many of them carry smaller market caps, which means even modest demand can spark noticeable gains. Altcoins that offer strong use cases, active development, and early-stage access through presales are being tracked closely by investors. Interest in Solana and Ethereum continues to rise because of their speed and utility, but analysts believe smaller tokens may show the top breakout potential.

The growth in altcoin interest is also tied to how these coins function. Some tokens power blockchains while others support decentralized apps or transaction models. The market is shifting toward altcoins that give real value through community interaction, AI features, or staking functions. Forbes shows that the global crypto market is expected to reach over 1.7 billion users by 2030. Many investors believe now is the time to look past Bitcoin and find tokens that offer more than storage of value.

Meme coins often draw attention for their viral appeal, but many fade due to weak fundamentals. A shift is happening in 2025 as investors begin to watch meme-based tokens that also provide real use cases. Some of these projects are combining community energy with tech-driven features that go beyond memes alone. This new direction has opened the door for a select group of tokens gaining traction not just for their theme but also for what they aim to do.

One of the more talked-about presales in this category is Dawgz AI, a token built on the Ethereum blockchain that introduces artificial intelligence into the meme coin model. Unlike many meme projects, it avoids NFTs and instead focuses on building AI-powered tools that support user interaction and growth. Dawgz AI recently passed a full audit by SolidProof, which improves transparency for early investors. The presale is currently active, with over $3.6 million raised and the price set at $0.00438 per token.

Crypto enthusiasts have started watching Dawgz AI not only because of its theme but also because of its structured roadmap. The token aims to introduce real features like AI meme generation and automated sentiment tools that reflect market trends. These use cases, combined with a strong presale performance, are pushing Dawgz AI into discussions about altcoins to buy in 2025. With increasing focus on AI-backed functionality in Web3, tokens like this may represent a shift toward community-first projects with more than just short-term hype.

Bitcoin remains a critical part of the market despite increasing focus on smaller altcoins. It holds the highest liquidity, the broadest adoption, and institutional backing that smaller tokens cannot match yet. Many investors view it as a stabilizer that has value when other assets dip.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $105364.94 with a market cap of over $2.09 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Its role has expanded since the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S., leading to a broader inflow of traditional capital. These developments make it a key component of most long-term portfolios, even for investors who also explore newer tokens.

Analysts from platforms like Forbes Digital Assets believe Bitcoin could still benefit from macroeconomic shifts in 2025. Although it may not offer the same percentage growth as smaller altcoins, its market strength and regulatory progress give it a strategic edge. For those building a diverse portfolio, BTC remains a top-tier option alongside more speculative plays.

Solana is one of the most discussed blockchains due to its fast transactions and low costs. Its focus on scalability has attracted developers, especially in DeFi and gaming, where fast performance is critical. The network continues to grow with more integrations and partnerships entering its ecosystem.

Solana is currently priced at $167.05, with a market cap of around $86.86 billion as reported by Binance. It has shown resilience after network outages in previous years, gaining back trust through upgrades and sustained uptime. The DefiLlama platform shows that Solana's total value locked (TVL) is increasing, pointing to deeper utility and long-term developer confidence.

Crypto enthusiasts view Solana as a strong bet in the altcoin market, especially as more Layer 1 platforms face congestion. While it may not carry the same meme appeal as newer presales, its real-world traction and developer interest make it one of the altcoins to buy when considering long-term utility in 2025.

Arbitrum brings Layer 2 scaling to Ethereum by allowing faster and cheaper transactions through rollup technology. It gives developers the flexibility of Ethereum's ecosystem without the gas fees that limit usability. As the demand for scalable smart contracts rises, Arbitrum is positioned to support a new wave of dApps.

ARB is trading at $0.3873, with a market cap of approximately $1.88 billion, based on Binance data. Its TVL continues to grow, surpassing $2.6 billion according to DefiLlama, which signals strong adoption. The Arbitrum Foundation is also working on grants and incentives to attract more developers to the platform.

Analysts expect Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum to be critical to Ethereum's scalability. Unlike Layer 1 competitors, Arbitrum does not compete with Ethereum but helps support its growth. That position gives ARB a unique value in the 2025 crypto cycle and places it among the top altcoin options for those seeking real network impact.

Presales have become a common entry point for investors who want to secure a position before a token hits public exchanges. Unlike launched projects, presales often offer lower prices, early access bonuses, and closer engagement with the team. This model allows investors to track early momentum, tokenomics, and marketing strategies before making larger commitments.

Recent data shows that investors have poured over $1 billion into presale crypto projects since late 2023, according to Cointelegraph. Dawgz AI stands out in this space by combining AI-based functionality with meme coin branding, a pairing that reflects where demand is heading. So far, Dawgz AI has raised over $3.6 million, with early investors noting its smart contract audit and utility roadmap as key reasons for interest.

Presales like Dawgz AI appeal to those who follow community growth and emerging trends. Many traders are looking for altcoins that serve a function or create tools that add value in real time. The best projects in this category often balance creativity with utility, and Dawgz AI is doing that through AI integration, a defined roadmap, and clear tokenomics. This shift suggests that presales in 2025 may not just be about hype, but about early access to tools built with purpose. For detailed information, please watch the following video:

Not all altcoins have staying power. Investors who plan to hold for the next few years are paying closer attention to how a project works rather than how fast its price moves. They're watching token utility, developer activity, community strength, and the ability to stay relevant as the market shifts.

According to Binance Research, many of the tokens that outperformed in the past cycle had something in common: clear purpose, transparent tokenomics, and consistent development. The same principles are guiding investor decisions now. As 2025 approaches, the altcoins with growing traction are those offering real-world tools, smart contract upgrades, and functional utility in Web3 or DeFi. Crypto enthusiasts are also paying attention to the teams behind these tokens and whether they've shared measurable milestones.

Traders looking for the best altcoins to buy now are not just chasing trends. They're studying presales like Dawgz AI that combine early-stage entry with long-term vision. They're also diversifying with large-cap tokens like Bitcoin and Solana, which continue to show market influence. In a sector known for volatility, tokens backed by utility and a clear purpose tend to attract those thinking long instead of short.

Presales are no longer just for early hype. In 2025, they are becoming a starting point for tokens built on actual use cases, not just clever branding. Investors are looking closely at utility, team transparency, and how early access gives them a better entry point before a token hits public markets.

Dawgz AI reflects this shift. It offers a mix of meme appeal and AI-driven tools while staying grounded in a clear roadmap and Ethereum-backed infrastructure. Its strong presale momentum, audit verification, and growing community are signals that traders are becoming more selective about where they place early bets.

If you're researching altcoins with potential beyond the surface, it may be worth taking a closer look at Dawgz AI. Visit the official Dawgz AI presale page to explore its features, roadmap, and pricing before the next phase fills.

The best altcoins in 2025 are those combining strong utility, growing communities, and developer activity. Projects like Dawgz AI, which offer real features and transparent roadmaps, are gaining early traction among long-term investors.

Yes, meme coins remain active in the market, especially when paired with real functionality. Dawgz AI is one example that blends meme culture with AI-powered tools to attract both traders and community supporters.

Analysts often consider token utility, market cap, trading volume, and development milestones when assessing altcoin growth. Tokens like Dawgz AI, which offer both functional use and active presale interest, fit the current trend investors are tracking.

A worthwhile presale typically includes verified audits, clear tokenomics, and a roadmap that outlines real features. Dawgz AI meets many of these criteria and has already raised over $3.6 million during its early phase.

Leading coin Bitcoin briefly soared above the $107,000 mark yesterday. It reached an intraday peak of $107,108, just 2% shy of its all-time high of $109,588, before retracing. 

Although the leading cryptocurrency has since retreated slightly to $104,976 at press time, market sentiment remains firmly bullish, with on-chain indicators suggesting continued upward momentum.

According to data from Blockchain Center, the cryptocurrency market remains deep in “Bitcoin Season,” a period when BTC significantly outperforms the broader altcoin market.

As of this writing, only 16 (32%) of the top 50 altcoins have outperformed BTC over the past 90 days, far below the 75% threshold required to qualify as “Altcoin Season.”

Furthermore, Bitcoin's rising dominance supports this position. Since plunging to a two-month low of 61.89% on May 16, BTC.D, a metric that tracks BTC's share of total crypto market capitalization, has climbed steadily.

As of this writing, the metric stands at 63.92%.

Interestingly, since May 14, TOTAL2, which measures the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding BTC, has trended downward. Currently standing at $1.18 trillion, it has plunged $83 billion over the past week. 

This divergence suggests market participants are increasingly reallocating capital into BTC over altcoins.

The current trend signals that traders are doubling down on BTC's resilience, especially as the king coin attempts to stabilize above the key $105,000 price mark.

On the daily chart, BTC's Directional Movement Index (DMI) confirms the bullish pressure in the market. As of this writing, the coin's positive directional index (+DI, blue) rests above its negative directional index (-DI, orange).

When an asset's DMI is set up this way, it indicates that bullish momentum is stronger than bearish momentum. This signals a prevailing uptrend and buying pressure in the BTC market.

If this continues, its price could attempt to breach the resistance at $107,048, and rally toward its all-time high of $109,588.

On the other hand, if sell-offs strengthen, BTC's price could dip to $102,080.

 Avalanche, Helix and Faculty Group launch Fusion, a $100 million initiative to build modular, sector-specific blockchain networks. 

Avalanche, Helix and Faculty Group have launched Fusion,  a new blockchain ecosystem aimed at driving real-world adoption through modular infrastructure tailored to specific industries.

Built on Avalanche, Fusion features a two-layer architecture that includes composers, customizable layer-1 networks and modules, which offer plug-and-play services like compute, identity and data oracles. 

The team said this approach would be the answer for mainstream adoption, as they attempt to deliver “outcome-driven, domain-specific” blockchain-based economies. 

“In order to achieve widespread adoption, our industry needs to shift from selling blockspace to delivering business value,” a Fusion spokesperson told Cointelegraph. They added that Fusion integrates economic alignment, network design and composability to achieve real-world outcomes.  

The Fusion team expects composers and modules — the two building blocks for the protocol — to gain traction in the next two to three years. 

The spokesperson told Cointelegraph that they are starting with five composers and nearly 100 modules in the first year. The team expects this to more than double over the next two to three years.

“Because of how the ecosystem is designed, in two to three years we expect that the Fusion ecosystem will consist of tens of composers and hundreds of modules,” the spokesperson said. 

Fusion's architecture is designed to let enterprises and Web3 builders combine technology, financial tools, and identity features in ways that were previously unavailable, the spokesperson added.

“Fusion is an initiative led and funded by the Avalanche community that is only technologically possible on Avalanche,” the spokesperson said, claiming that the initiative strengthens Avalanche's position as a blockchain that delivers real-world business value.

The project is funded by resources allocated in existing Avalanche programs. According to Fusion's announcement, the funds will come from Avalanche's Multiverse, an incentive program to accelerate the adoption of Avalanche subnets, and Retro9000, a grant program that rewards developers who build infrastructure and tools.

Fusion also uses funds from InfraBUIDL and InfraBUIDL AI, programs designed to fund Avalanche-based projects. 

“The funds will be distributed to support the medium-term growth of the Fusion ecosystem, including composers, modules and end-users,” the spokesperson told Cointelegraph.

Chapters I through VIII are tradable NFTs, currently listed and available for trading on Magic Eden. In contrast, Chapter IX: “Guardians in the Cave” is a Soulbound NFT – a non-transferable asset that ensures authenticity and prevents identity spoofing among participants.

As of now, Monadverse has released 9 chapters, each accompanied by an exclusive NFT. Beyond their collectible and content access value, holding NFTs from the Monadverse collection may also increase a user's eligibility for future airdrops from the Monad project.

Over 225,000 Chapter IX NFTs: “Guardians in the Cave” have been distributed. If you've collected multiple Monadverse chapters and haven't received Chapter IX, users can check directly on the Monadverse website.

However, if you are not familiar with Monadverse, users can check through Monad Explorer.

Step 1: Go to Monad Explorer

Visit the Monad Explorer website from your desktop or mobile browser. The interface is user-friendly and supports searching by wallet address or transaction hash.



Step 2: Search by Wallet Address

Paste the wallet address you used to interact with Monadverse chapters into the search bar. Monad Explorer will display all tokens and NFTs held by that address.



Step 3: Check the “Token/NFT Holdings” Section

Click into the Token section, then navigate to the NFT tab. To locate Chapter IX NFTs more easily, look for names like “Guardians in the Cave”, or refer to the official contract address provided by Monadverse announcements.



Due to its non-transferable nature, Chapter IX NFTs have no trading or resale value. Anyone offering to sell, exchange, or providing claim links outside of official Monadverse channels should be considered a scam risk.

Monadverse consistently reminds the community to:

Chapter IX came as a surprise drop for users who held five or more chapters, unlike previous ones that required direct interaction.

Monad determined eligibility based on users' previous claim history and on-chain activity. This means that even if you didn't receive a notification or didn't manually claim anything recently, you may still have received the NFT.

Non-fungible token (NFT) project Pudgy Penguins has announced another significant partnership today with Random House, one of the world's largest publishing companies.

A children's book titled “The Worst Birthday Present Ever” will be released through Random House Kids in November. The book is centered around a Lil Pudgy called Pongo, whose friends accidentally gift him real swords instead of balloon swords for his birthday, according to a release.

""We are so excited to introduce this adorable new picture book to the millions of devoted Pudgy Penguins fans, as well as new readers eager for more penguin-themed content,” said Sara Sargent, the Senior Executive Editor at Random House Books for Young Readers.

The book is Pudgy Penguins' latest foray into mainstream media and culture, after launching its line of toys with retailers such as Walmart and Target in 2023 and 2024. The brand also touts a massive social media following, with 1.8 million followers on Instagram and 684,000 on TikTok.

The Pudgy Penguins, purchased by current CEO Luca Netz for 750 ETH in April 2022, have evolved from forgotten relics of 2021's NFT summer into one of the top collections in the NFT space. The NFTs boast a 10 ETH ($25,000) floor price, only trailing the Bored Ape Yacht Club (13 ETH) and CryptoPunks (46 ETH) collections in the profile picture (PFP) segment.

The project also launched its PENGU ecosystem token on December 18, and the token currently trades at a $780 million market capitalization, with a $950 million fully diluted valuation. The prices of PENGU and Pudgy Penguins NFTs are relatively unchanged on today's news.

In addition to its branded products, Pudgy Penguins' parent company, Igloo Inc, is developing an Ethereum Layer 2 network, Abstract, which launched in January. Abstract has recorded slow but steady growth, and its total value locked (TVL) sits at $27 million, with $20 million in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume over the last 24 hours.

The King of Pigs ($KOPS), built on the most robust BSC chain, has kick-started its ICO on May 17th, giving traders and cryptocurrency enthusiasts a unique investment opportunity. With the token selling for just $0.001, right now is the best chance for investors to get involved and see the rewards of increasing popularity. The King of Pigs ($KOPS) coin is attracting much attention because the project offers a unique referral program, generous bonuses, and the KOPS UGC Contest.

The referral program is one of the top features of the $KOPS ICO, making it easy for people to earn rewards by referring family or friends. Anyone investing just $25 in $KOPS will receive their reference code that can be used to invite friends. Anyone who joins the ICO using your code will earn rewards and privileges. As a result, investors can increase their share by encouraging new participants in the $KOPS ICO. It allows investors to get more value from their investments with no additional cost.

Besides the referral bonuses, buying $KOPS during the ICO gives you a 100% bonus. By doubling the amount of tokens bought, investors benefit immediately after purchasing. The bonus tokens will appear in the investor's wallet after the period and can be redeemed using the rewards page. The only criterion is to acquire a minimum of 1000 $KOPS. Thus, early buyers of $KOPS at the ICO will be able to reap the rewards from day one.

The platform runs a User-Generated Content (UGC) contest to help energize the $KOPS community. The Creator Fund contest consists of 85,000,000 $KOPS tokens that can be won by people who submit videos, memes, threads, and more. As there are big rewards for the best entries, both amateurs and professionals are motivated to take part and create work that could bring them token prizes.

For the UGC contest, the top prize is 20 million $KOPS, the second-place medalists get 10 million $KOPS, and third place gets 5 million $KOPS. Besides, 30 million $KOPS are distributed between 20 popular creators, the community selects 5 million, and 15 million is given for popular, humorous, or lesser-known content. Anyone can join, and suddenly sharing a successful meme could add much to an individual's $KOPS. Everyone can join in, earn new tokens, and participate in the $KOPS platform.

While each $KOPS can be bought for as low as $0.001 during the ICO, many think its value will rise significantly. If $KOPS rises to $0.4, $0.6, or even $0.8, people with a big holding will collect significant returns. For instance, 5 million tokens valued at $0.8 each can profit considerably. Since the growth potential is quite strong, early $KOPS investors might discover that the value of their coins increases quickly.

The development team has officially commenced the ICO of $KOPS. The $KOPS ICO is the best opportunity for those interested in cryptocurrency due to its awesome bonuses, top-class referral program, and impressive UGC contest. Those who buy early will benefit the most when the token's value rises later.

The $KOPS ICO provides a special way for individuals to start investing in cryptocurrency. By entering at just $0.001, enjoying many rewards and the UGC contest, joining $KOPS means becoming part of a lively community with many opportunities. Those who invest now can take advantage of the future potential of $KOPS.

UK Information Commissioner John Edwards is on a bit of a speaking tour, having recently addressed Privacy New Zealand – a country where he spent eight years serving as privacy commissioner – and the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)'s Data Protection Intensive UK 2025.

His message is a mix of human-centric thinking and a warning to services that flout the rules, guided by the principle that “data protection is not just about computers, numbers and legislation – it's about people.”

Edwards tells the IAPP that “since I arrived in the UK and took up this role in 2022, my aim has been to regulate for outcomes, not outputs. I'm interested in real impact, real change, rather than products, things that might be easy to count, but that ultimately don't improve the lives or experiences of people in the UK.”

He cites real scenarios in which irresponsible data handling leading to data breaches can have grave consequences: “Imagine a person fleeing a violent domestic relationship, only to have their new address accidentally shared with their abuser.” Rather than a mere “admin error”, Edwards wants to frame these mistakes within a wider social context, notably in how they impact people in vulnerable positions.

He believes “the public should not be expected to have to read reams of legalese in a privacy notice to understand what's happening to their information,” that “they should not be kept in the dark about where their information's going and what it's being used for,” and that “they should not be coerced or forced into handing over their information without being fully informed about the consequences.”

While consumers can play a role in the larger task of data protection, Edwards says “there is a limit. It's the responsibility of the whole organisation, from the C-suite down, to keep things simple and accessible for their users.”

To illustrate the role of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), Edwards points to its ongoing investigations into TikTok, Reddit and Imgur.

“Our role is to ask questions on behalf of young people, so they don't have to make complex decisions about how they transact with their personal information in an asymmetric information relationship,” Edwards says.

“How do these platforms protect children's personal information? How do their recommender systems work, how are they using a 13 year old's preferences, viewing habits, shares and likes to serve them content, and keep them on the platform? And, in the case of Reddit and Imgur, how do they assess the age of their users and tailor their content accordingly?”

From age assurance to consent in the collection of personal data, “children shouldn't have to figure this out by themselves. It's not their job.”

“So we've stepped in, because it's our job as the UK's data protection regulator to hold these platforms to account. If social media and video sharing platforms want to benefit from operating in the UK, they must comply with data protection law.”

The decision to target three of the biggest social media and video sharing platforms is intentional – and definitely not a signal for smaller businesses to ignore the law.

“I want to make it very clear,” Edwards says. “By focusing our efforts on some of the largest, most well known platforms, we are not giving smaller companies a free pass to adopt or continue unlawful practices. Instead, last week's announcement should serve as a warning shot. All organisations using children's data, or who offer products or services aimed at young people, need to comply with the law and conform with our children's code.”

“Get your own house in order. You shouldn't wait for the regulator to come knocking on your door before checking your processes.”

Edwards says the ICO continues to focus on AI and biometrics continues. “I've asked my team to look at foundation models, automated decision-making in recruitment and by government and how police forces use facial recognition technology. We'll be closely scrutinising any proposed deployment of predictive profiling that could affect people's rights.”

We're also looking ahead at the technologies and innovations that are likely to burst onto the scene in the next two to seven years.”

Edwards' address to Privacy New Zealand focuses on the ICO's work in childrens' online safety.

He says the age appropriate design code, which he “inherited,” has “directly led to a huge number of improvements in the safety of a number of the most popular platforms and digital services available to children.”

“One of the largest platforms told me that as a result of the code and our work, they made more changes to their product products than they did when the GDPR came in, and that's huge.” He cites wins like turning off geolocation for kids by default and turning off notifications after bedtime.

Edwards reiterates that the ICO's priorities for the year are children online, AI and biometrics –  regarding the latter, “there's a real rush to market which means that there are risks and opportunities and we need to stay ahead of those – and, finally, online tracking and advertising.

He mentions policy work consulting on papers addressing “some of the personal information implications of generative AI and how large language models are trained.”

Edwards has fines at his disposal, if needed. But he stresses that real change takes time.

“I've started to use the example that one of the first decisions I took in my job here in 2022 was to confirm a fine my predecessor proposed against Clearview AI ,which you know is the biometric facial recognition matching service used by law enforcement authorities based on scraped images from around the web.”

Clearview appealed that fine and won, forcing the ICO to seek its own appeal. “It took the tribunal a year to respond to our request for an appeal,” Edwards says. “We've now got a date for that appeal. I‘m three and a half years into my term now; there is no chance that that matter will be determined before my term ends.”

Edwards also makes brief reference to Australia's social media ban for users under 16. Once again, his human-centric perspective guides his thinking.

“I think one of the most sensible things I've heard on this subject came from a real advocate who's sometimes a pretty harsh critic of my office and  me personally, and the role that we play.”

Edwards is referring to Baroness Beeban Kidron, who he calls “really the author of the kids code in many ways.”

“She was asked about this issue of a ban and her view I think was really sensible. She said it's better to make these technologies safe for children than to try and ban them. And I think that's right.”

That said, parental oversight only goes so far. “The thing is I wonder, you know, we expect that parents will not give their children cigarettes right? But we also make it a crime for retailers to sell children under 18 cigarettes. And I think there is an analogy there.”

Privacy concerns are no longer a side issue in crypto; they're central to user protection. As blockchain networks grow more open and surveillance tools become more advanced, the risks linked to data exposure through traditional wallets are becoming more apparent.
Cold Wallet brings a new direction by merging zero-knowledge technology with cold-storage methods. It enables users to maintain full control over their digital activity without sacrificing accessibility, offering a seamless experience designed around confidentiality.
   
Currently priced at $0.00773 during stage 6 of its presale, with a planned listing value of $0.3517, Cold Wallet is gaining serious attention. With growing interest in DeFi tools that protect user identity, analysts suggest it holds the potential to reach 100x returns post-launch.
Fixing the Hidden Privacy Flaws in Popular Wallets
There's a common assumption that managing one's own keys guarantees safety. But the reality is that many widely used wallets leak sensitive data. From revealing IP details to tracking user behavior via analytics, these tools can expose strategies and personal details that should remain private.       
Cold Wallet answers this with a system that mimics offline behavior even when connected. Its infrastructure leverages zero-knowledge proofs to hide user balances, blur transaction histories, and stop data leaks. It goes beyond traditional tools by ensuring both usability and advanced protection at all times.

This approach makes it stand out among privacy-driven crypto launches. Cold Wallet prioritizes stealth, secure interactions, and peace of mind, key traits that appeal to both individual users and institutional players.
Cold Wallet Presale, Utility Role, and Platform Vision
Cold Wallet is presenting a genuine working solution to the rising data privacy challenge. Its design supports real-world use with a structured system that powers essential features and user feedback-driven upgrades.
The $CWT unit fuels platform governance, enables privacy tools, and allows users to take part in the project's future development. Now available in stage 6 of its crypto presale at $0.00773, with a listing price planned at $0.3517, its positioning gives an advantage to early contributors who value practical applications.   

Participants gain input into major decisions, such as protocol upgrades and third-party integrations. With DeFi platforms leaning more toward secure design and private operations, Cold Wallet's model fits the need for foundational tech in the space.
Rather than serving as a placeholder, $CWT has been developed to perform key roles across the platform's operation. As adoption spreads, the expectation is that usage and demand will climb steadily.
Why Cold Wallet Stands Out in the Privacy Sector
Today's crypto audience is paying more attention to projects with practical use cases rather than marketing buzz. Cold Wallet's real appeal comes from its capacity to meet the needs of both everyday users and larger entities without giving up usability or protection.
The platform allows DeFi participants to operate with full privacy, avoiding exposure to competitors or external trackers. For high-volume traders, this means conducting activities without unwanted visibility.        

The development roadmap includes features like browser access, mobile apps, multi-chain connections, and business-level deployment. As regulatory pressures rise and user data protection becomes more critical, Cold Wallet's offering becomes even more timely and necessary.
If usage scales as predicted, the current sub-1-cent price could grow toward $0.71, matching the 100x forecast. With its focus on privacy and real-world problem-solving, Cold Wallet positions itself as a rare example of utility-focused progress in digital finance.
Final Thoughts!
Cold Wallet is focused on solving a critical issue, not chasing quick volume. Through zero-knowledge architecture, tracker-free design, and a user-first system, it reinforces core Web3 values: ownership and privacy.
At the $0.00773 presale price and a listing goal of $0.3517, the potential for gain is substantial. More importantly, its foundation in tech and usability supports long-term relevance. For those seeking a Web3 tool with real purpose and clear direction, Cold Wallet offers one of the strongest use cases currently on the rise.

If usage scales as predicted, the current sub-1-cent price could grow toward $0.71, matching the 100x forecast. With its focus on privacy and real-world problem-solving, Cold Wallet positions itself as a rare example of utility-focused progress in digital finance.
Final Thoughts!

There's a common assumption that managing one's own keys guarantees safety. But the reality is that many widely used wallets leak sensitive data. From revealing IP details to tracking user behavior via analytics, these tools can expose strategies and personal details that should remain private.       
Cold Wallet answers this with a system that mimics offline behavior even when connected. Its infrastructure leverages zero-knowledge proofs to hide user balances, blur transaction histories, and stop data leaks. It goes beyond traditional tools by ensuring both usability and advanced protection at all times.

This approach makes it stand out among privacy-driven crypto launches. Cold Wallet prioritizes stealth, secure interactions, and peace of mind, key traits that appeal to both individual users and institutional players.
Cold Wallet Presale, Utility Role, and Platform Vision
Cold Wallet is presenting a genuine working solution to the rising data privacy challenge. Its design supports real-world use with a structured system that powers essential features and user feedback-driven upgrades.
The $CWT unit fuels platform governance, enables privacy tools, and allows users to take part in the project's future development. Now available in stage 6 of its crypto presale at $0.00773, with a listing price planned at $0.3517, its positioning gives an advantage to early contributors who value practical applications.   

Participants gain input into major decisions, such as protocol upgrades and third-party integrations. With DeFi platforms leaning more toward secure design and private operations, Cold Wallet's model fits the need for foundational tech in the space.
Rather than serving as a placeholder, $CWT has been developed to perform key roles across the platform's operation. As adoption spreads, the expectation is that usage and demand will climb steadily.
Why Cold Wallet Stands Out in the Privacy Sector
Today's crypto audience is paying more attention to projects with practical use cases rather than marketing buzz. Cold Wallet's real appeal comes from its capacity to meet the needs of both everyday users and larger entities without giving up usability or protection.

Project Han River offers glimpse into Korea's cautious but strategic approach to central bank digital currency adoption

Signaling a new chapter in digital finance, the Bank of Korea last month launched ""Project Han River,"" a pilot program for its central bank digital currency, or CBDC. Running from April through June, the trial invites 100,000 individuals to test tokenized deposits, with roughly 60,000 participating as of Monday, according to the BOK.

The Korea Herald also took part to see how the system works in practice.





Getting started: Digital wallets and token transfers

The first step involved opening a digital wallet through one of seven participating banks, KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Hana, Woori, NongHyup, IBK and BNK, via their mobile apps. After verifying a bank account and linking it to the wallet, users must transfer funds into the wallet, converting cash into tokenized deposits. Participants can hold up to 1 million won ($719) in digital tokens at a time.



Usable, but not smooth

Payments are currently accepted at a handful of merchants. This includes 7-Eleven, Kyobo Book Centre, Hanaro Mart and Ediya Coffee for in-store options and Hyundai Home Shopping and Ddangyo food delivery apps for online payments.

We tested the system at a 7-Eleven in Seoul. At checkout, we opened the banking app, tapped the wallet tab, entered a password, selected the QR payment option, entered the password again and scanned the code. Though similar to other contactless payments, the process involved noticeably more steps, with minor lags and interface delays making the experience feel clunky.

Online payments felt more intuitive, working much like other easy payment systems or digital wallets.

Overall, while the experience was comparable to existing mobile payments, tokenized deposits felt less preferable due to small but persistent technical hurdles that are hard to ignore in an era of near-seamless digital finance.

After the first phase ends in June, the BOK plans to conduct system maintenance before launching a second round of testing later this year. The next stage will introduce person-to-person transfers and expand the number of participating merchants.



More for the system, than shoppers

So why launch a CBDC at all, especially when digital payment tools are already fast and widespread?

CBDCs are expected to benefit governments and the broader financial system more than individual users. Issued by the central bank, a CBDC is a digital version of cash built on blockchain. It is programmable and traceable, but unlike cryptocurrencies, it is fiat money: fully regulated and anchored to national stability.

By digitizing transactions, CBDCs can lower costs, streamline transfers and expand financial access. They also allow governments to distribute emergency and social benefits more directly, avoiding the delays of cash and the complexities of working with financial institutions.

For the central bank, the goal goes beyond convenience. The CBDC is seen as a way to future-proof the financial system by preserving access to sovereign money and reinforcing central bank authority in an increasingly digital world. Centralized oversight also boosts transparency and helps deter illicit activity.

Internationally, CBDCs could streamline cross-border payments and reduce reliance on private financial networks, supporting closer monetary cooperation.



Privacy fears and technical risks

Still, the idea is not without pushback. Critics warn that a traceable, state-issued currency could enable financial surveillance or restrict how money is used. Since the launch of the pilot project, petitions opposing CBDC adoption have drawn more than 50,000 signatures on the National Assembly's public petition platform and have been submitted for parliamentary review.

A BOK official overseeing the project downplayed privacy concerns, emphasizing that the current trial involves a wholesale model for interbank use. Unlike a retail CBDC, where the central bank issues tokens directly to individuals, the wholesale version issues CBDC to commercial banks. The banks then provide users with deposit tokens, keeping individual transaction data out of the central bank's reach.

“At this stage, the (central) Bank is focused solely on developing a wholesale CBDC system,” the official said. “Even if a general-use CBDC were to be introduced, it would require far more work and discussion, given the complexity and sensitivity involved.”

There are also concerns about systemic risk. A technical failure or cyberattack could disrupt the entire financial system, posing not only daily inconvenience but also national security threats.



Digital push grows, but cash will stay

Though CBDCs may take time to match the ease of today's digital wallets, Korea's pilot marks a key step toward digital currency — one that could reshape how money is stored, spent and distributed. Policymakers see it as a long-term upgrade to financial infrastructure and a potential shift in the nature of currency itself.

The program has also sparked debate among policymakers and academics over how to regulate emerging forms of currency — not only CBDCs, but also private digital assets such as stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. As these assets grow, governments face mounting pressure to update legal frameworks and build public consensus on the future of money.

The debate extends beyond Korea. While many countries are advancing CBDCs, the US has paused development, opting instead to back dollar-pegged stablecoins.

Still, the BOK has made clear it has no plans to eliminate physical cash.

“The reason we can use various digital payment methods with confidence is because we trust they're backed by a centrally operated system, which allows conversion to cash at any time,” said BOK Deputy Governor Lee Jong-ryeol during a recent briefing. “Maintaining that trust in the currency system is a core responsibility of the Bank,” he added, noting there are “no plans to fully phase out physical cash.”

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday (May 19) that the bank now offers its clients access to bitcoin.

Dimon announced this at the bank's annual investor day, while reiterating his own skepticism about digital currency, CNBC reported Monday.

“We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon said, per the report. “We're not going to custody it. We're going to put it in statements for clients.”

Dimon added that he remains concerned about issues around bitcoin, such as money laundering, lack of clarity in terms of ownership and use in illicit activities, according to the report.

“I don't think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke,” Dimon said, per the report. “I defend your right to buy bitcoin.”

It was reported in December 2023 that Dimon had been a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies for some time and that he told a Senate Banking Committee hearing that if he had the power, he would shut down the entire industry.

While he criticized cryptocurrencies, he had different views on blockchain technology, and JPMorgan actively embraced that technology for various projects, including the development of its proprietary stablecoin, JPM Coin.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) provided new guidance March 28 saying that FDIC-supervised institutions can engage in crypto-related activities without receiving prior FDIC approval, provided they adequately manage the associated risks.

Previously, under guidance that the FDIC rescinded, the agency required prior notification of crypto-related activities.

“With today's action, the FDIC is turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years,” FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill said at the time in a press release. “I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards.”

Institutional adoption of digital assets like cryptocurrencies and tokenized securities is seen as inevitable, although risk remains an obstacle, PYMNTS reported May 13.

The new wave of adoption is being led by highly regulated institutions, which are grappling with the core question of risk across the blockchain.

Bitcoin Foundation Chairman Brock Pierce joins ‘Varney & Co.' to discuss Trump's ‘crypto strategic reserve' plan. 

Threats against high-profile names in the cryptocurrency world are rising as the value of industry holdings continues to grow.

Geno Roefaro, CEO of Florida-based SaferWatch, a security platform designed to enhance emergency response across public and private institutions, has observed a growing trend: organized crime groups are increasingly targeting individuals' cryptocurrency holdings using ""sophisticated methods.""

Jethro Pijlman, managing director of Netherlands-based Infinite Risks International, a firm that provides physical security and intelligence services to cryptocurrency holders, told FOX Business that threats against crypto executives have noticeably increased globally since 2021.

Last week, a group of men tried to attack the daughter of French crypto firm Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat on the street in Paris in broad daylight. Earlier this year, the founder of French crypto company Ledger and his wife were kidnapped. In a separate incident, the father of the head of another crypto company was also kidnapped, according to Reuters. While all of them were rescued, it provoked a sense of fear and urgency among other high-net-worth individuals in the sector. 

Additionally, there has been a ""particularly high concentration in Asia,"" Pijlman said.

Coinbase revealed in a recent regulatory filing that it spent $6.2 million last year on personal security for CEO Brian Armstrong.

""This trend aligns with the cyclical nature of the crypto markets. Each cycle typically includes a euphoric phase marked by the rapid accumulation of wealth,"" Pijlman said, noting that ""it is common for individuals to publicly display their newfound prosperity through luxury vehicles, high-end real estate, expensive watches, and other status symbols, often showcased on YouTube, Instagram, and other social media platforms.""

Last fall, for instance, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun purchased Maurizio Cattelan's famed banana duct-taped to a wall artwork for $6.2 million. Not only was the purchase itself noteworthy, but Sun, who founded the Tron blockchain in 2017, was then filmed eating the viral fruit during a news conference in Hong Kong. To commemorate the moment, he also posted a tongue-in-cheek comment on X about the taste of the viral fruit. 

""Unfortunately, this public exposure often occurs without adequate awareness of personal security risks,"" Pijlman said, adding that ""many individuals unintentionally share sensitive information online."" This includes travel itineraries, attendance at industry events or meetups, photos of luxury vehicles with visible license plates, identifiable backgrounds and real-time videos from upscale restaurants, clubs or private gatherings. Even posts or tags by friends can unintentionally reveal their location, according to Pijlman. 

""This kind of content provides a treasure trove of intelligence for criminal organizations. It is not uncommon for such groups to monitor a target's digital footprint for weeks or even months before executing a robbery or abduction. The level of detail available through open-source intelligence is often staggering,"" he added. 

COINBASE SUES SEC, FDIC FOR INFORMATION RELATING TO CRYPTO REGULATION

Pijlman said his firm applies the same techniques used to locate individuals in threat assessments to proactively protect its clients. This includes real-time alerts when oversharing occurs and helping clients adjust their online behavior to reduce exposure. The firm's transportation services are delivered exclusively by security-trained drivers. In most major cities throughout Europe and the United States, the firm deploys executive protection agents, often with government or military backgrounds, who specialize in minimizing personal risk during client movements. It also offers residential security solutions, including armed protection. 

Roefaro told FOX Business that the rapid rise in cryptocurrency wealth has added a new layer of complexity to executive protection.

""As digital fortunes grow, so does the risk of targeted attacks. The hiring of personal security by crypto high-rollers is not merely a trend but a strategic necessity,"" Roefaro said. ""It's a clear indication that personal security must evolve in tandem with financial innovation.""

Roefaro's company, which created a discrete device to help executives, other employees and their families get help without drawing any attention, also has a client in the cryptocurrency space.

These are the most attractive type of high-value targets for organized crime, according to Roefaro, as the asset they are stealing is already in the form of digital currency. It is also hard for victims to recover from the losses because they transfer them internationally, Roefaro said. 

Sean Worthington, founder of CloudCoin, one of the first cloud-based digital currencies developed outside of blockchain, said that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin carry inherent risks of theft and loss due to their reliance on a single critical component known as the private key. 

""This ‘golden egg' represents a fundamental vulnerability, as there are no built-in safeguards to mitigate the risk it poses. Insiders – such as system administrators or software developers at cryptocurrency firms – can potentially siphon funds undetected, leaving businesses exposed to significant financial losses with little recourse or accountability,"" he said.

Federal lawmakers from New York and Connecticut want to regulate the cryptocurrency stablecoin. They have different ideas about what that should look like.

On Monday, the U.S. Senate advanced legislation to create the country's first regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to the value of a stable currency, like the U.S. dollar. The legislation is supported by the crypto industry.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), a former securities lawyer, is the lead Democratic co-sponsor of the bill.

“A product of months of bipartisan negotiations, the GENIUS Act will protect consumers, enable responsible innovation, and safeguard the dominance of the U.S. dollar,” Gillibrand said in a statement. “The bill takes aim at illicit finance, places limitations on Big Tech, puts in place ethical guardrails and defends national security.”

Monday's vote was for cloture, which doesn't pass the legislation out of the Senate. It limits debate on the bill and makes way for it to go to a final vote.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) voted against the bill, citing that it didn't do anything to prevent President Donald Trump from profiting off his stablecoin, USD1. Murphy wants to add amendments to that extent, but Republicans control the Senate and are unlikely to advance them.

“The GENIUS Act exempts President Trump from the ethics laws on stablecoin. It allows him to continue his corruption,” Murphy posted on X. “Some of the Democrats who voted to advance the bill tonight want this changed before the final vote. So there is still time to fix this - if we speak up.”

U.S. Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) also voted against the legislation.","{'href': 'https://www.wshu.org', 'title': 'WSHU'}","cryptocurrency"

Genesis Global Capital, a cryptocurrency lender, has filed lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and DCG CEO Barry Silbert. The lawsuits, filed in two courts, seek to recover over $3.1 billion related to note and asset transfers. Genesis alleges insider self-dealing, fraud, and mismanagement by Silbert, accusing him of improper transfers exceeding $1 billion while the company was insolvent. These legal actions come amid broader accusations that Silbert misrepresented the financial status of his companies, contributing to the collapse of the 2022 cryptocurrency market. The litigation reflects ongoing tensions within the crypto industry and highlights disputes over financial transparency and corporate governance at DCG and its subsidiaries.

WASHINGTON — The Senate advanced a major cryptocurrency regulation bill Monday on a bipartisan vote two weeks after every Senate Democrat united to block it. 

The procedural vote on the GENIUS Act — which would establish the first regulatory framework for issuers of stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar — was 66-32. Sixteen Democrats voted with the majority of Senate Republicans to advance the bill. Two Republicans, Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Jerry Moran of Kansas, voted against it. 

The bill needed to cross the 60-vote threshold to advance to final passage in the Senate, where Republicans hold a three-seat majority.

Democratic support to proceed with the legislation was unlocked after a group of bipartisan negotiators — Sens. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn; Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo.; Mark Warner, D-Va.; Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.; Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md.; and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz. — reached an agreement late last week on an amendment to the bill that addressed key sticking points for Democrats. 

The amendment, which Democratic negotiators circulated over the weekend and has been obtained by NBC News, includes new changes to consumer protection safeguards and limits on tech companies issuing stablecoins, and it would extend ethics standards to special government employees — which would temporarily apply to Elon Musk and tech entrepreneur David Sacks. 

In exchange for the negotiated changes, Democrats involved in discussions said they have committed to support advancing the GENIUS Act, according to multiple sources familiar with the talks. 

Senate Republicans have been noncommittal about backing the amendment, but the updated changes are likely to get more Democrats on board beyond the core group involved in negotiations.

The bill hit a roadblock two weeks ago when Democrats, along with two Republicans — Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri — blocked the bill from advancing, demanding stronger national security and anti-money laundering provisions. 

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., criticized his colleagues across the aisle for delaying the vote, pointing out that no changes have been made to the underlying bill that Democrats blocked two weeks ago. 

“It's really hard to understand why we needed to wait an additional 11 days for Democrats to finally agree to move,” Thune said Monday, adding that he expects the Senate won't vote on final passage before it leaves for the Memorial Day recess. 

The Trump family's crypto dealings with World Liberty Financial, and President Donald Trump's dinner for the top holders of his meme coin, have aggravated concerns among Democrats. (Meme coins are different from stable coins, as they typically derive value from internet culture rather than from an underlying utility or asset.) But no provisions in the negotiated amendment would prohibit Trump and his family from continuing their crypto ventures. 

The bill text includes a provision that would “prohibit any member of Congress or senior executive branch official from issuing a payment stablecoin product during their time in public service.”

Some Democrats have argued it needs to be stronger.

“Basic flaws remain unaddressed,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., the top Democrat on the Banking Committee, said on the Senate floor Monday. “Congress should not choose to enable the president's egregious corruption.”

Several Senate Democrats have also introduced bills targeting the Trump family's crypto ventures to prevent the president from potentially profiting off of the deals. 

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., for example, plans to offer legislation called the STABLE Act, which would prevent elected officials and federal candidates from issuing or endorsing digital assets, as an amendment to the GENIUS Act. 

Democrats are expected to force votes on those bills this week, but they are unlikely to go anywhere in the GOP-controlled chamber.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., convened a caucus-wide call Sunday night to discuss the GENIUS Act. Warren voiced her concerns about the bill during the call, according to a person with knowledge of her comments. 

While some Democrats like Warren said they can't vote for the bill without stronger provisions that limit Trump's profiting from digital assets, others, like Warner, argued that Congress can no longer sit on the sidelines of the evolving cryptocurrency space.

“Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family's use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” Warner, who voted to advance the GENIUS Act, wrote in a statement Monday. 

“But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay. If American lawmakers don't shape it, others will — and not in ways that serve our interests or democratic values,” he added.

If the Senate ultimately passes the GENIUS Act, its future is less clear in the House, where there is a different bill to regulate stablecoin issuers. Cryptocurrency advocates argue that Congress should also pass legislation to determine regulatory treatment of digital assets and digital asset securities.

“The winners, if Congress passes this bill, are Americans who want to make payments faster and easier to access,” said Kara Calvert, the vice president for public policy at Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange. “It's transformational technology, so passing this bill is a win for them. It's not just a win for the industry or a political candidate.”

The Senate has advanced legislation aimed at regulating the market for stablecoins, amid concerns that the bill could create new opportunities for President Donald Trump and his family to profit from their cryptocurrency ventures.

The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, passed the procedural vote by a margin 66 to 32, with two senators abstaining.

Newsweek has reached out to some of the senators who voted in favor, as well as those who voted against the bill. Newsweek has also contacted the White House for its response to the concerns expressed by senators over the legislation and Trump's crypto ventures.

White House officials have previously rejected the idea that the president's burgeoning cryptocurrency activities during his second term pose any conflict of interest.

Regulating stablecoins—cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to another asset, in this case the American dollar—has been touted by supporters of a bill as a crucial step towards wider oversight of the cryptocurrency market, and one that will strengthen U.S. innovation in the space.

However, concerns over gaps in the bill's safeguards drew sharp objections from some Democrats, led by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who argued it could ""accelerate Trump's corruption"" by ""supercharging the size of the stablecoin market"" and the power of the tokens marketed by the president and his family.

The GENIUS Act advanced after weeks of debate and several amendments prompted by Democratic concerns about consumer protections, limits for tech companies issuing stablecoins, and ethics standards for certain government employees. However, the bill does not directly restrict Trump or his family from proceeding with existing digital asset ventures, such as the USD1 stablecoin launched by World Liberty Financial.

Newsweek has reached out to World Liberty Financial and the Trump Organization for comment.

Senate Democrats previously blocked a motion to move the bill forward in early May, with the support of Republican Senators Rand Paul and Josh Hawley, citing concerns about possible conflicts of interest tied to Trump's cryptocurrency activities and objections to the bill's anti-money laundering provisions.

Those opposing the bill have alleged that the potential boost it would give to the stablecoin market would financially benefit the president, who has entered this space with the launch of USD1 by the Trump-affiliated crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. Warren has argued that any bill should include prohibitions on government officials engaging in stablecoin ventures, ""so that foreign governments and giant corporations cannot use stablecoins to pay bribes to the President of the United States.""

Alongside 16 Democrats, the majority of Republicans voted in favor of the bill on Monday, the exceptions being Kentucky's Rand Paul, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Senator Josh Hawley, who did not cast a vote.

Supporters of the legislation have insisted the measure will secure U.S. leadership in technology and prevent the crypto market from shifting overseas. New York Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand said of the bill: ""The bipartisan GENIUS Act will provide regulatory clarity to this important industry, keep innovation on shore, add robust consumer protection, and reaffirm the dominance of the U.S. dollar.""

In a statement on his website ahead of the vote, Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner said: ""The stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can't afford to keep standing on the sidelines. We need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation. The GENIUS Act is a meaningful step forward. It sets high standards for issuers, limits big tech overreach, and creates a safer, more transparent framework for digital assets. It's not perfect, but it's far better than the status quo.""

Warner acknowledged the potential concerns of his fellow Democrats over ""the Trump family's use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans."" However, he added: ""We cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay. If American lawmakers don't shape it, others will.""

Tennessee Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, one of the bill's sponsors, posted to X: ""This groundbreaking, bipartisan legislation will bring America's payment system into the 21st century. The GENIUS Act skyrockets the United States with a digital payment framework with the fastest rails possible. It will ensure U.S. dollar dominance. Customers will be protected, the demand for U.S. treasuries will balloon to the tune of more than $1 trillion, and innovation in the digital asset space will thrive in the United States going forward.""

""It is an essential first step that will protect consumers, keep America at the forefront of technological innovation, and further solidify the dominance of the U.S. dollar,"" Hagerty said in an earlier post.

Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, said: ""This weak bill is worse than no bill at all.""

""The GENIUS Act will accelerate Trump's corruption by supercharging the size of the stablecoin market and the reach and profitability Trump's USD1,"" Warren continued. ""And, for the first time in American history, this bill will make our president, Donald Trump, the regulator of his own financial product.""

Financial analyst Lyn Alden told Newsweek: ""I think the concerns around conflicts of interest are reasonably valid, although that's a broad theme in this administration, rather than a crypto-specific thing. It would be comparable to passing legislation that benefits real estate owners for a president who has considerable real estate interests. I think stablecoin legislation is important to pass at this time, and transparency is important. In general, I'm supportive of bills that reduce conflicts of interest among elected and appointed officials, whether it relates to issuing or sponsoring cryptocurrencies or trading individual stocks, and there are plenty of valid concerns around existing and potential conflicts of interest.""

The bill has surpassed the 60-vote threshold needed to advance to a full Senate vote, which one anonymous Senate source told cryptocurrency-focused outlet Decrypt could happen as soon as Wednesday.

Supported by

Democrats who had sided with the rest of their party last week to block the measure over concerns that President Trump could benefit dropped their objections. They argued that regulating the industry was urgent.

By Robert Jimison

Reporting from the Capitol

The Senate on Monday revived a first-of-its-kind bill to regulate parts of the cryptocurrency industry, after a small number of Democrats who had joined the rest of their party in blocking the measure joined Republicans in allowing it to advance.

The vote was 66 to 32 to move forward with the legislation, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an existing asset, often the U.S. dollar. Sixteen Democrats joined the majority of Republicans in support, acting over the opposition of most others in their party, who were concerned that President Trump and his family were inappropriately profiting from crypto.

The vote was a victory for the cryptocurrency industry, which has made significant advances in Washington with the backing of Mr. Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers. It suggested that the measure would have enough support to pass the Senate and potentially make it to Mr. Trump's desk in short order. A parallel effort in the House has faced similar backlash from Democrats, who earlier this month blocked a hearing on the legislation but are unlikely to have the votes to prevent it from passing.

In the Senate, a bloc of Democratic supporters had pressed in recent days to include stronger consumer protections and transparency requirements in the legislation, as well as provisions aimed at combating money laundering and terrorism financing.

But the most animating worry for Democrats was that the legislation could enable the president and his family to profit by issuing their own stablecoins. Concerns over the Trump family's involvement in the industry intensified after reporting by The New York Times showed how a firm associated with the president had recently become one of the most influential players in the industry.

In a prolonged round of bipartisan negotiations over the bill, Republicans steadfastly refused to consider adding any provision to rein in Mr. Trump's involvement in the industry, or make any modification that could interfere with his or his family's ability to benefit.

Crypto markets extended their climb with ether (ETH) jumping 8% and bitcoin (BTC) inching back toward the $106,000 mark in the past 24 hours, despite broader risk-off sentiment in equities and gold.

The resilience is in contrast to Friday's surprise credit downgrade of the U.S. by Moody's, which cited persistent fiscal deficits and political gridlock. Yet while equities sagged and gold extended its recent decline, falling nearly 7% from May highs, bitcoin held ground and even rallied briefly to $107,000 late Sunday before retracing.

“Bitcoin's ability to rally over the weekend despite a risk-off tone in equities following the Moody's downgrade reinforces its positioning as a legitimate store of value,” QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast late Monday.

The firm pointed to consistent inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs and institutional demand as catalysts, even as derivatives markets saw some leveraged long liquidations.

Ether was among the standout movers, surging past $2,900 in a strong follow-through move from last week's breakout. The token's recent strength has been tied to renewed interest in Ethereum staking flows and positive sentiment following the Pectra upgrade — though no new headline catalyst emerged on Monday.

Solana's SOL, XRP, BNB Chain's BNB and dogecoin (DOGE) rose between 2-4%, with the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) adding just under 2% in the past 24 hours.

Meanwhile, Aave's AAVE tokens soared over 25% in the past 24 hours, though the move appeared largely speculative. No protocol-level announcement or governance proposal was immediately tied to the jump. The token is still down over 60% from its 2021 highs.

Traders say the decoupling between bitcoin and traditional “hard assets” like gold is worth watching. 

“Unlike in previous months where BTC and gold went up in unison, bitcoin has been rising against a drop in spot gold, which is also reflected in ETF flows,” Augustine Fan of SignalPlus said in a message to CoinDesk.

“Gold ETFs saw a notable drop in flows against a small rise in BTC ETFs, with a similar pattern in gold vs BTC futures on CME. We should assume more of these micro-correlation breaks and relative value opportunities to take hold,” Fan ended.

The U.S. Senate voted to move ahead on stablecoin legislation Monday night, removing a procedural barrier to ultimately passing the bill out of the body entirely.



Senators easily cleared the 60-vote threshold for the vote, which is intended to just move the legislation to a period of further debate before a final vote series to pass it out of the Senate. The House of Representatives is working its way through its own version of stablecoin legislation, which is intended to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins and their issuers in the U.S. 



The Senate previously failed to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance the bill during a vote on May 8, after Democratic lawmakers raised concerns about consumer protection and national security provisions. That vote had failed on a bipartisan basis, after Republicans Josh Hawley and Rand Paul also voted against cloture.



Despite that earlier setback, industry participants expected easy passage on Monday after lawmakers spent much of the last week negotiating changes in language, though many of these changes seemed marginal.



One individual following the negotiations told CoinDesk that ""there's enough"" in the newest version of the bill to address some of Democrats' concerns earlier on Monday, though the lawmakers negotiating language could have added more hefty consumer protection provisions.



After that latest overhaul, several Democratic lawmakers who previously voted against cloture, including Senators Ruben Gallego and Mark Warner, announced they would vote in favor of cloture ahead of the vote.

Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this report owns shares of Strategy (MSTR).

Strategy's (MSTR) perpetual preferred stock, STRK, achieved the largest proceeds from its weekly at-the-market (ATM) issuance since the program started in February, according to X account DogCandles, raising $59.7 million that was used to buy more bitcoin BTC$106,120.31, according to a Monday SEC filing. 

That amount corresponds to the issuance of approximately 621,555 STRK shares. Strategy has about $20.79 billion still available in the STRK ATM facility.

The company led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor is plowing ahead with its bitcoin-buying strategy even as the price of the largest cryptocurrency holds above $100,000, with an eye on its January record of $109,000. Strategy's Monday BTC purchase took its total holdings to 576,230 BTC.

This represents a 16.3% BTC yield, a key performance indicator (KPI) that reflects the year-to-date percentage increase in the ratio of MSTR's bitcoin holdings to its assumed diluted shares outstanding, effectively measuring the growth in BTC exposure on a per-share basis.

The recent STRK issuance represents just under 9% of the total proceeds generated from the ATM program for the common stock, which has raised $705.7 million to date. This highlights the increasing role STRK is playing in Strategy's  bitcoin acquisition model.

STRK features a fixed 8% annual dividend, which is based on the $100 per share liquidation preference, resulting in an annual payout of $8.00 per share. 

That gives it an effective yield, annual dividend divided by STRK share price, of 8.1%. Importantly, this yield is inversely related to the share price. As STRK trades higher, the yield decreases, and vice versa.

Since its launch on Feb. 10, STRK has risen by 16%, outperforming both bitcoin, which has added 10%, and the S&P 500, which has declined by 2% over the same period. 

According to data from the Strategy dashboard, STRK exhibits the lowest correlation with MSTR common stock, sitting at just 44%. In contrast, STRK maintains relatively higher correlations with broader market benchmarks: 71% with bitcoin and 72% with the SPY exchange-traded fund.

This suggests that STRK trades with a unique profile, potentially appealing to investors seeking differentiated exposure due to its hybrid nature as a preferred equity instrument with bitcoin-tied capital deployment.

 The German government sold its Bitcoin stash in the summer of 2024, which became a $2.3 billion missed opportunity for Europe's largest economy. 

The German government missed out on more than $2 billion worth of Bitcoin profit after selling its holdings in 2024, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham.

A “German Government (BKA)” labeled cryptocurrency wallet sold 49,858 Bitcoin (BTC) worth over $2.89 billion at an average price of $57,900 across multiple transactions during June and July in 2024.

The decision to sell the Bitcoin early cost the German government over $2.35 billion, according to crypto intelligence platform Arkham.

“If they had held it, their BTC would now be worth $5.24B,” Arkham said in a May 19 X post, noting that Bitcoin has risen more than 80% since the sale.

At the time of publication, Bitcoin was trading at more than $104,700, according to CoinMarketCap data.

The German government-labeled wallet first raised speculation of a potential sell-off on June 19, 2024, when it executed a 6,500 BTC transfer worth over $425 million.

The wallet originally held around 50,000 BTC, believed to have been seized from the operators of Movie2k, a now-defunct pirated film site.

The wallet's selling patterns point to hasty transactions that weren't optimized for the smallest market impact and best profitability, according to Miguel Morel, founder of Arkham Intelligence.

“The last thing I would have expected is that they would just go to five different exchanges and start market selling,” Morel told Cointelegraph during an interview at EthCC 2024, adding:

The reports surrounding the German government's Bitcoin liquidations may have contributed more to Bitcoin's downtrend than the volume of sold Bitcoin.

Bitcoin's price recovered above the $60,000 psychological mark on July 14, a day after the German government-labeled wallet ran out of BTC, putting an end to investor uncertainty about further selling pressure.

 “AI agents will soon conduct most economic transactions,” said Catena Labs CEO Sean Neville, as the company secured $18 million to build a regulated AI-native financial institution. 

Circle co-founder and Catena Labs CEO Sean Neville has launched a project that aims to develop a financial institution that natively leverages artificial intelligence. 

On May 20, Catena Labs, the company building an “AI-native financial institution,” announced that it secured $18 million in a funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) Crypto, a16z's crypto and Web3 venture capital arm. 

Led by Neville, the company aims to realize its vision of a fully regulated financial institution for the AI economy. The company said it will be built for AI agents and human collaborators and will be operated by AI workers with human oversight and AI-specific risk management and compliance approaches. 

Cointelegraph contacted Catena Labs to get more information about the project but received no response before publication. 

In the announcement, Catena Labs argued that conventional financial systems resist AI technology. The company said these systems are unprepared for AI and are hindering the growth of the agent economy. 

Neville said in a news release that AI agents will soon conduct most economic transactions, but noted that financial systems are unprepared.

The company said AI agents are becoming “powerful economic participants,” and the world's financial infrastructure can't keep up. Catana described the infrastructure as “slow, expensive, full of global friction, inflexible and ill-suited to the new opportunities and risks of AI.”

The company said this prompted them to create an AI-native financial institution to address the challenges of traditional financial systems. 

“That's why we're building an AI-native financial institution that will give AI agents, and the businesses and consumers they serve, the ability to transact safely and efficiently,” Neville said. 

In addition to the announcement, the team also shared an Agent Commerce Kit (ACK), an open-source set of patterns, components and emerging protocols for verifiable agent identity. The company said they are using an ACK as an early building block.

In the announcement, Catena Labs said AI agents can use traditional systems and financial rails. However, the company said the agents gain superpowers when paired with stablecoins, which the company described as “AI-native money.”

The company mentioned that regulated stablecoins like USDC (USDC) enable near-instant, low-cost, global transactions, which are essential for AI agents. 

“Using AI-native money, agents can unlock new business models and greater prosperity for humans and businesses,” Catena Labs wrote.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Bitcoin is signaling a golden cross — What does it mean for BTC price?","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-golden-cross-what-does-it-mean-for-btc-price","Tue, 20 May 2025 10:15:25 GMT","

 Most recent Bitcoin golden crosses have triggered major rallies, though not without notable failures like the February 2020 bull trap. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin is nearing a golden cross that has led to 45%–60% price rallies in the recent past.

Fundamentals like rising M2 supply and easing trade tensions support a bullish outlook.

Bearish divergence and overbought conditions show there's still a risk of BTC falling below $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) will likely confirm a “golden cross” on its daily chart by the end of May, a technical pattern whose occurrences in recent years often preceded rallies.

As of May 20, Bitcoin's 50-day simple moving average (50-day SMA; the red wave) was eyeing a close above its 200-day SMA (the blue wave) for the first time since October 2024, forming a golden cross.

Previously, BTC price had gained over 60%, with the reelection of Donald Trump as the US president playing a key role. 

In October 2023, the golden cross was followed by a 45% BTC price rally, helped by Bitcoin ETF euphoria. September 2021 saw 50% gains in BTC price after painting a similar SMA crossover.

Using indicators that worked in the past is not a guaranteed strategy. 

Traders learned that in February 2020, when Bitcoin's golden cross preceded a 62% price crash, primarily due to the global market rout led by the COVID-19 lockdowns.

That episode underscores the importance of using golden crosses with broader technical and macro indicators while factoring in the possibility of unexpected events. 

As of now, Bitcoin's upcoming golden cross aligns with mostly supportive fundamentals, placing the signal on the bullish side of the ledger. 

Increasing M2 money supply and easing US-China trade tensions, for instance, have propelled bets on a new record high for Bitcoin. 

What's notable this time is that BTC is signaling a correction after its relative strength index (RSI) crossed above the overbought threshold of 70 earlier in May.

So, instead of an immediate rally after the cross, Bitcoin may initially pull back toward its SMA supports, sitting around the $92,400-95,000 range as of May 20. 

A growing bearish divergence between the rising Bitcoin price and falling RSI furthers the chances of short-term downside. Nonetheless, some technical indicators see the BTC price rallying toward $150,000 in the coming months.

 Avalanche, Helix and Faculty Group launch Fusion, a $100 million initiative to build modular, sector-specific blockchain networks. 

Avalanche, Helix and Faculty Group have launched Fusion,  a new blockchain ecosystem aimed at driving real-world adoption through modular infrastructure tailored to specific industries.

Built on Avalanche, Fusion features a two-layer architecture that includes composers, customizable layer-1 networks and modules, which offer plug-and-play services like compute, identity and data oracles. 

The team said this approach would be the answer for mainstream adoption, as they attempt to deliver “outcome-driven, domain-specific” blockchain-based economies. 

“In order to achieve widespread adoption, our industry needs to shift from selling blockspace to delivering business value,” a Fusion spokesperson told Cointelegraph. They added that Fusion integrates economic alignment, network design and composability to achieve real-world outcomes.  

The Fusion team expects composers and modules — the two building blocks for the protocol — to gain traction in the next two to three years. 

The spokesperson told Cointelegraph that they are starting with five composers and nearly 100 modules in the first year. The team expects this to more than double over the next two to three years.

“Because of how the ecosystem is designed, in two to three years we expect that the Fusion ecosystem will consist of tens of composers and hundreds of modules,” the spokesperson said. 

Fusion's architecture is designed to let enterprises and Web3 builders combine technology, financial tools, and identity features in ways that were previously unavailable, the spokesperson added.

“Fusion is an initiative led and funded by the Avalanche community that is only technologically possible on Avalanche,” the spokesperson said, claiming that the initiative strengthens Avalanche's position as a blockchain that delivers real-world business value.

The project is funded by resources allocated in existing Avalanche programs. According to Fusion's announcement, the funds will come from Avalanche's Multiverse, an incentive program to accelerate the adoption of Avalanche subnets, and Retro9000, a grant program that rewards developers who build infrastructure and tools.

Fusion also uses funds from InfraBUIDL and InfraBUIDL AI, programs designed to fund Avalanche-based projects. 

“The funds will be distributed to support the medium-term growth of the Fusion ecosystem, including composers, modules and end-users,” the spokesperson told Cointelegraph.

Inside the Bold Geoengineering Work to Refreeze the Arctic's Disappearing Ice

Researchers are trying to rebuild sea ice above the Arctic Circle so it can reflect the sun's warming rays, slowing climate change

By Alec Luhn edited by Mark Fischetti

A team with Real Ice prepares to drill through sea ice in the Canadian Arctic, having already flooded a nearby patch (darker blue) to thicken it.

Taylor Roades

This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center's Ocean Reporting Network.

A haze of ice crystals in the air created a halo around the low sun as three snowmobiles thundered onto the sea ice on a February morning in far northern Canada. Wisps of snow blew across the white expanse. It was –26 degrees Celsius as we left Cambridge Bay, an Inuit village in a vast archipelago of treeless islands and ice-choked channels. This temperature was relatively warm—six degrees C above average. The winter had been the mildest in 75 years. The sea ice covering the Arctic Ocean was at its smallest extent on record. Scientists predict that within the next 15 years this ice cap will disappear in summer for the first time in millennia, accelerating global warming. The U.K. company Real Ice, whose heavily bundled team was bouncing around on the other two snowmobiles ahead of mine, hopes to prevent that outcome with an effort that has been called extremely ambitious, insane or even dangerous.

At a spot seven kilometers from the village, Real Ice co-founder Cían Sherwin, an Irishman with a red beanie and scraggy goatee, hopped off his snowmobile and started drilling with a long electric auger. A gob of water and frozen shavings sloshed up and out of the hole as he punctured the underside of the ice more than a meter below. Inuit guide David Kavanna widened the opening with a spearlike ice saw, then placed a wood box around it. Sherwin lowered an aluminum pump, which looked like a large coffee urn attached to a curved rubber hose, through the hole. He plugged a cable into a battery pack. After a few seconds water began pouring out of the hose, spilling onto the ice in an ethereal shade of blue. As it congeals, “the water acts almost like lava,” Sherwin said. “The ice formation starts almost instantly.”

Thin, broad sheets of ice expand from the ice cap's edges in winter, when it's dark and cold, and melt away in summer, when the sun shines 24 hours a day. The ice acts like a giant mirror, reflecting up to 90 percent of the sun's radiation back toward space. Ocean water, in contrast, absorbs 90 percent of sunlight. The ice cap's core of so-called multiyear ice, which persists year-round, has shrunk by about 40 percent in four decades, kicking off a vicious cycle: as more ice melts, more ocean water is exposed, and that water warms further, melting even more ice. If the ice starts disappearing entirely in summer, global temperatures could rise an extra 0.19 degree C by 2050.

Real Ice is trying to thicken seasonal ice so it lasts longer into the warm months, keeping the planet cool. Sherwin hopes pumping could someday refreeze a million square kilometers of both seasonal and multiyear ice—an area the size of Texas and New Mexico combined and about a fifth of what's now left in summer—to stop the ice cap's death spiral. All it would take, Real Ice says, is half a million ice-making robots.

Polar geoengineering on such an enormous scale could help slow warming until the world finally weans itself off coal, oil and natural gas. Many scientists think it will never work. The researchers at Real Ice argue we no longer have any option but to try; studies suggest that even slashing fossil-fuel use may not save summertime sea ice. “It's sad that it's ended up that way, but we've got to do something about it,” Sherwin said to me out on the frozen plain. “Emissions reduction is just not enough anymore.”

Cambridge Bay, which British explorers named for a 19th-century Duke of Cambridge, is a town of 1,800 mostly Inuit inhabitants located across from the Canadian mainland on Victoria Island, one of the world's largest islands. When I landed at the one-room airport on a twin-engine turboprop, I was greeted by a stuffed musk ox and a placard about the 1845 British naval expedition of John Franklin. Cambridge Bay lies along the Northwest Passage, an icy sea route between Europe and Asia sought by explorers for 400 years. Franklin's two ships, Erebus and Terror, were trapped in the polar sea ice that surges down toward Cambridge Bay in winter, buckling into ridges up to 10 meters high. All 129 men onboard died of cold, starvation or disease. These days cruise ships coast through the passage every year, often visiting grave sites of Franklin expedition members.

The Inuit call Cambridge Bay Ikaluktutiak, meaning “good fishing place.” For millennia their nomadic ancestors came here to fish Arctic char, a silvery-orange cousin of the brook trout. Inuit started living here full-time in the 1940s and 1950s, when the U.S. military hired them to help build a navigation tower and a radar station to detect Soviet bombers coming over the pole. The cold war also led to the idea of controlling the Arctic environment. The U.S.S.R. discussed destroying sea ice with coal dust or explosions and detonated three nuclear devices to try to excavate an Arctic canal. In the U.S., physicist Edward Teller's Project Plowshare nearly got approval to gouge out a harbor in Alaska with atomic bombs.

Geoengineering today is intended to cool Earth to fend off climate change. Some scientists and entrepreneurs are focused on dispersing sulfate particles in the stratosphere to block sunlight, which could lessen heating but also disrupt global weather patterns such as the South Asian monsoon. Mexico recently announced a ban on this solar geoengineering after Silicon Valley start-up Make Sunsets launched two balloons full of sulfur dioxide there. The city of Alameda, Calif., halted an experiment to spray sea-salt particles skyward to make clouds more reflective. Field trials targeting the Arctic, the Antarctic and the “third pole” of colossal glaciers in the Himalayas have stirred up less controversy, perhaps because unintended consequences would be confined largely to those distant places. In Iceland and India, Silicon Valley nonprofit Bright Ice Initiative has scattered tiny glass beads on glaciers to try to reflect more sunlight and slow the melting. Chinese agencies have blown chemical smoke into clouds with rockets, planes, drones and chimneys to provoke snowfall over glaciers on the Tibetan plateau. Researchers in Scandinavia are developing giant curtains that could be anchored to the seabed to block warm ocean water from melting the undersides of ice shelves in Antarctica. Billions of dollars would be needed to affect the climate.

The idea for thickening ice came from outer space. At a 2012 conference a fractious forum about global warming soured Arizona State University astrophysicist Steve Desch's hopes for quick climate action. Desch, who studies icy bodies such as Pluto's moon Charon, wondered whether we could buy time by making ice in the Arctic. The problem is that sea ice freezes from below. Once the first layer forms, it insulates the seawater from the air, which can be 50 degrees C colder. The thicker the ice gets, the slower it grows. In 2016 Desch published a paper proposing that wind-powered pumps could thicken sea ice by pulling up water from below and spraying it across the top.

Around that time, students at Bangor University in Wales were inspired by a documentary on the Arctic to construct a “re-icing machine,” an ungainly spindle of hoses that twirled like a lawn sprinkler. One of those students was Sherwin. Encouraged by Desch's paper, he and London entrepreneur Simon Woods founded Real Ice in 2022 to see whether sea-ice thickening could scale up. They eventually recruited Desch and several sea-ice scientists as advisers. The company put its first water onto ice in Nome, Alaska, in January 2023, ditching the sprinkler for a commercial pump. They moved to the Canadian High Arctic Research Station in Cambridge Bay the next year to do more. “It's not exactly the same as a natural process, but it's as close as you can get,” Desch says.

After the team drilled the first hole that February morning and started the pump, we snowmobiled to a destination pinpointed by GPS several hundred meters away. Again the group drilled and inserted a pump, and water began whooshing out. In all, we installed four pumps in four places. As water pooled, the edges crept outward, soaking into the pockmarked snow, which was up to 25 centimeters (10 inches) thick and crusty like hardened white frosting. Within hours the pool would coagulate into electric-blue slush, like a gas station Slurpee.

After a lunch of fruit bars and potato chips around a tiny gas heater in the team's rescue tent, we went to a site the crew had pumped a day earlier. Under a dusting of snow lay flat gray ice. With a drill bit almost as tall as himself, one of the volunteers bored a hole and dropped in a measuring tape with fold-out brass arms at its end. The ice was 152 centimeters thick; almost 30 centimeters of ice had been added, compared with untouched sites they measured.

The ice would thicken further in coming weeks. Because snow is a better insulator than ice—this quality is why igloos work so well—flooding and freezing the snow could allow more cold to penetrate to the ice's underside, creating more ice. After Real Ice thickened 4,100 square meters of ice here in winter 2023–2024, the crew came back in May 2024 to find a significant increase. Across the area they had pumped, ice thickness was 1.9 meters, compared with 1.44 meters in other places. “Ice growth from below—that's the really efficient part,” Woods told me as he drilled a measuring hole at another refrozen site.

But snow is also a better mirror than ice, which could complicate the picture. Sea ice covered by snow reflects 90 percent of solar radiation, whereas bare sea ice reflects 50 to 70 percent. Real Ice would need snow to accumulate in spring to replenish the snow it flooded in winter, or the process could increase melting.

That's just one way flooding snow could backfire. As seawater freezes, the salt in it is ejected from the ice crystals, leading ever saltier pockets of brine to form on the surface. Salt lowers the freezing point of ice, whether on winter roads or the sea. If pumping seawater leaves more salt on the surface in summertime, it could end up accelerating the disappearance of the ice.

So far this doesn't seem to be happening. On another morning Woods put a hollow red barrel on the drill and bored into the ice at a refrozen site to extract an ice core about as long and thick as his arm. He held it up to the pale sun, which illuminated hairline channels where the salty fluid had eaten its way through the ice. “This natural process helps the brine to migrate back into the ocean,” he said.

It's still not clear how ice thickening will affect sea life, starting with the microscopic algae that grow on the underside of the ice. They're eaten by zooplankton, which are eaten by fish, which are eaten by mammals. On a different morning I snowmobiled with University of Alaska Fairbanks marine biologist Brendan Kelly to a low ridge formed by two enormous plates of ice pushing together. A polar science adviser in President Barack Obama's administration, Kelly has studied seals and polar bears for more than four decades. In that time he's also watched fossil-fuel emissions march steadily upward. So despite his discomfort with geoengineering, he agreed to advise Real Ice.

In the hazy light, the monochrome landscape seemed devoid of life. But as we crunched on foot along the snow caking the ridge, Kelly stopped to point out an Arctic fox footprint. Farther on he found a urine stain, then desiccated green scat, then a small pit. “Seal, probably,” Kelly said. In spring, ringed seals claw holes through snowdrifts. They hide their fuzzy white pups in these lairs while they dive for fish and crustaceans. Foxes and polar bears dig around to try to find the pups. Kelly scooped at the firm snow, tiny icicles swaying from his white mustache, but couldn't find a lair.

Polar bears also depend on snow. They excavate dens in larger drifts to warm their cubs, which are born the size of a guinea pig. Most Arctic snow tends to fall in late autumn. It's unknown whether enough new snow would build up after wintertime ice thickening for bears and seals to make dens in spring. Of course, polar bears and seals are already expected to decline as their sea-ice habitat melts away. Is Real Ice doing more harm than good by pumping seawater into this environment, melting the snow? “We don't know that,” Kelly said. “But we need to know it.”

Across two months last winter, Real Ice pumped water through almost 200 holes. Drills and snowmobiles broke, team members got frostnip, and Arctic foxes chewed through long, thin thermistor cables used to measure temperature in the snow and ice. The researchers thickened 250,000 square meters of sea ice. The ice cap is losing 300,000 times that area every year.

The key to scaling up is to “bring the engineering underwater,” Sherwin told me later. The Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa, Italy, is developing an underwater drone two meters long that will bore through ice from below with a heated pipe and start pumping water up through it. In renderings, it looks like a folding pocketknife with a pipe instead of a blade. Real Ice hopes to test a prototype this year, says co-CEO Andrea Ceccolini, an Italian computer scientist and investor who joined the company in 2022.

The plan is to thicken 100 square kilometers of sea ice in winter 2027–2028 to demonstrate the technique to governments and investors. The approach verges on the fantastic. A swarm of 50 drones would melt holes in minutes and pump water as their infrared cameras monitored the progress. Technicians on a floating or onshore hub would swap out the drones' batteries, plugging the old ones into chargers powered by wind turbines or by green hydrogen or ammonia brought in by ship. Tapping into electricity from Canada's Nunavut region would contribute to climate change because most of it is generated from diesel fuel.

The ultimate goal of thickening one million square kilometers of sea ice would take an estimated 500,000 drones, which would consume two terawatt-hours of electricity and require 20,000 people to service them, according to rough math Ceccolini has done. The cost would be $10 billion annually. The drones would vastly exceed the 3,800 Argo robot sensors circulating in oceans worldwide, and drone experts say a revolution in battery technology would be needed.

A pump, powered by batteries, pours seawater from under the ice onto the surface, where it floods snow and makes new ice, thickening the sheet so it will last longer in the coming summer's sun.

Taylor Roades

How much global warming could be countered through sea-ice preservation depends on numerous variables affecting sunlight and melt dynamics. Preserving a million square kilometers of sea ice for one additional summer month would cool Earth as much as removing 930 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over 20 years, Real Ice estimates. For these results, $10 billion is actually cheap, Ceccolini says, and the cooling would be immediate. Capturing that much CO2 from the air with existing machines would currently cost at least $465 billion. For perspective, humanity emits 910 million tons of CO2 every eight days, with no end in sight. Thickening sea ice is a Band-Aid “while you cure the patient—the planet—properly,” Ceccolini says.

Every day in Cambridge Bay, after three or four hours of flooding, the team used an ice ax to hack each pump out of its hole. Fat white frost flowers formed on top of the solidifying surface. The speed of the freeze was striking—but so was the immensity of the frozen plain stretching to the horizon. It was hard to envision hundreds of thousands of drones popping through the ice day after day, all winter long, for decades.

The only highway in Cambridge Bay is the sea ice. In winter and spring, Inuit residents snowmobile hundreds of kilometers over it to go ice fishing and hunt musk ox and seals, local hunter Brandon Langan told me in his living room, a black musk ox hide hanging behind him. He works part-time for Real Ice flying airborne drones to monitor the thickened ice's reflectivity. When the ice recedes in summer, the Inuit fish the Arctic char that run into the bay from lakes and streams. When ice returns in fall, they hunt the caribou that cross it to the mainland. Two out of every three meals are fish or game. “Sea ice, to us, it's life,” Langan said. “It helps us get our food. It gives us our clothing.”

Now hunters who used to start moving on the ice in October have to delay until December. A few have even fallen through. In spring, the ice cracks and melts sooner. Ice loss has diminished the local caribou herd by 90 percent; the animals go hungry waiting to cross, and when bottled up for too long on the shore, they're easier prey for wolves. Hundreds of caribou have drowned after breaking through the ice. One hunter who had previously been a guide for Real Ice told me at the cultural center in the high school library that he hopes ice thickening could rejuvenate game populations.

Inuit insights are vital. Throughout history scientists and explorers often ignored Indigenous knowledge of the Arctic. The last time anyone saw the Franklin expedition was when Inuit hunters encountered starving sailors dragging a lifeboat across the ice in Washington Bay, clad in wool rather than furs. Franklin was dead, and the remaining explorers traded the Inuit beads for seal meat—they apparently didn't know how to hunt seal themselves. Later, native people found mutilated bodies farther south, indicating the explorers had resorted to cannibalism. Charles Dickens dismissed these reports, which were later confirmed, as “the wild tales of a herd of savages” and suggested the Inuit had slain Franklin's men. This colonial mindset would persist as the Arctic came under government control. Canada and Alaska took Indigenous children, including some from Cambridge Bay, away to be reeducated in abusive residential schools, where thousands died.

A week after I met with Langan I talked with Inuit Circumpolar Council international chairwoman Sara Olsvig, who has spoken out against testing the seabed-curtain idea in her native Greenland. She says governments need to start regulating geoengineering, and researchers need to seek the free, prior and informed consent of local communities. When somebody claims, “‘We need your piece of land in the name of a greater good,' that's exactly what happened when we were colonized,” Olsvig says.

Real Ice obtained permits from Nunavut's Inuit government, as well as the Cambridge Bay hunters-and-trappers organization. Ceccolini says the operation will shut down if ice thickening proves ineffective or damaging. Although the company may patent its drone technology, its articles of association prohibit it from distributing profits. But it would consider founding a new company with Indigenous part-ownership if it decided to scale up, Ceccolini says.

Local elders are hesitant. They gather at the cultural center on weekdays to sew fur boots and mittens and speak the local language. During a break for black tea and candied Arctic char, I asked three of them about the sea-ice thickening. They would be concerned about the drones if Real Ice conducted its 100-square-kilometer demonstration, a key step to scaling up, in the strait near Cambridge Bay rather than farther north. “If they start doing that under the water, we're going to get no more fish, no more seal, no more nothing,” said Annie Atighioyak, who was born in an igloo on the sea ice in 1940.

As global fossil-fuel emissions keep rising, attitudes about geoengineering are starting to change. Two weeks before I arrived in Cambridge Bay I went to an annual Arctic science conference at the Oceanographic Institute of Monaco. Frederik Paulsen, a Swedish pharmaceutical billionaire in a tailored suit and rimless glasses, took the podium. Though not a scientist, Paulsen was the first person to reach all eight poles—the geographic, geomagnetic, magnetic and least accessible poles of each hemisphere—and was onboard one of the two submersibles that planted a Russian flag on the North Pole seabed in 2007.

In 2023, while flying over Greenland in an ultralight aircraft, Paulsen was startled to notice that the once brilliant ice sheet was turning darker as less fresh snow fell. He said he decided only “more drastic solutions” could avoid catastrophic climate impacts, given our failure to rein in fossil fuels. It's not enough to just study climate, he scolded the scientists. “Now is the time to act.”

The University of the Arctic, a network of educational institutions that Paulsen chairs, has rated the feasibility of 61 polar interventions, from spraying glaciers with ski-resort snow guns to cables that stop icebergs from drifting south. At the conference, John Moore, a University of Lapland glaciologist, presented the seabed-curtain idea. Also there was Fonger Ypma of Arctic Reflections, a Dutch sea-ice-thickening company that has done field trials in Newfoundland and Svalbard. Last year he went to Cambridge Bay to learn from Real Ice, but he hopes to deploy large movable pumping platforms rather than drones.

Frost flowers form when very cold, still air rests on newly formed ice (at left), which is relatively much warmer. Vapor rising from the ice rapidly crystalizes, creating the flowers.

Taylor Roades

The surge of interest has created a schism in polar science. In October 2024 a preprint paper by 42 top glaciologists condemned ice thickening and other polar geoengineering techniques as dangerous and unfeasible. Seabed curtains could disrupt nutrient flows to CO2-consuming phytoplankton. Spreading tiny glass spheres across mountain glaciers could decrease the reflectivity of ice covered in fresh snow. But the overarching concern is that geoengineering fixes are “making decarbonization a lot less attractive,” according to Heidi Sevestre, one of the paper's authors, who visited an Arctic Reflections trial last year. What they are offering “doesn't attack the cause of the issue, the fossil fuels,” she says.

At the Monaco conference, Kim Holmén, a Norwegian Polar Institute climate scientist who has spent more than three decades on Svalbard, the fastest-warming place on Earth, argued that trying to undo the harms of our technology with even more technology was folly. “I make mistakes every day, you make mistakes every day, and if we create a system where it must work every day, it will fail,” he said. Critics say it would be more effective to put geoengineering funds toward cutting emissions.

The amount being spent on Arctic geoengineering is small but growing. Arctic Reflections has raised $1.1 million and Moore $2 million. Real Ice's directors have committed $5 million to its ice-thickening project, only a fraction of the cost for a 100-square-kilometer demonstration. It's hard to imagine state agencies allocating $10 billion a year for sea-ice thickening, especially with China, Russia and reportedly the U.S. looking to develop Arctic shipping routes; for them, less ice is better. Brazil's Amazon Fund for rainforest conservation, which Real Ice has held up as a possible funding model, has collected only $780 million from governments.

Private investors might mean fewer political obstacles. In March, Paulsen, who's offering a €100,000 prize for projects “reversing Arctic change,” convened a dinner in Geneva to introduce geoengineering researchers—including a Real Ice adviser—to two dozen potential donors. He wants to hold similar “adopt-a-billionaire” gatherings in the U.S. He also claims he's discussed geoengineering with officials from the Trump administration, which withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. The administration didn't respond to a request for comment.

Real Ice and Arctic Reflections would like to eventually sell “cooling credits,” a strategy used by Make Sunsets. Individuals and companies that want to compensate for their CO2 emissions pay that start-up to launch balloons full of sunlight-blocking sulfur dioxide. Carbon credits have paid for the planting of trees to remove tens of millions of tons of CO2 from the atmosphere. But the credit arrangements also have been criticized as a “license to pollute” to avoid fossil-fuel reductions. Some of the biggest buyers are tech firms such as Microsoft, whose emissions are swelling as the company builds AI data centers.

Kelly, the former White House adviser, is indeed worried that geoengineering could be “hijacked” by oil or tech companies as an excuse to continue business as usual. But he's more concerned about the gigantic geoengineering experiment he says we're already conducting by emitting tens of billions of tons of greenhouse gases every year. Ice companies just have to be willing to shut down their technology if it starts harming nature or undermining climate goals, he told me as we drank coffee at the research station in Cambridge Bay. They have to be willing to turn back, unlike Franklin and other overconfident explorers who came here to discover the Northwest Passage. “We all have to keep asking ourselves and checking ourselves and one another: Have we slid into hubris?” Kelly said. “The alternative is to think [we humans] know what's best, that we can get through the passage.”

DNA Studies Uncover Unexpected Evolutionary Changes in Modern Humans

Mounting evidence from genome studies indicates that, contrary to received wisdom, our species has undergone profound biological adaptation in its recent evolutionary past

By Kermit Pattison edited by Kate Wong

Chris Gash

The Indigenous peoples of the Bolivian highlands are survivors. For thousands of years they have lived at altitudes of more than two miles, where oxygen is about 35 percent lower than at sea level. This type of setting is among the harshest environments humans have ever inhabited. Scientists have recognized for some time that these residents of the Andes Mountains have evolved genetic adaptations to the thin air of their lofty home. Now researchers are learning that they have also evolved another remarkable genetic adaptation since their ancestors first settled the highlands of South America around 10,000 years ago.

In the volcanic bedrock of the Andes, arsenic is naturally abundant and leaches into the drinking water. The dangers it poses are well known: inorganic arsenic is associated with cancers, skin lesions, heart disease, diabetes and infant mortality in other populations. But the biochemistry of Andeans has evolved to efficiently metabolize this notoriously toxic substance. Populations in Bolivia—along with groups in Argentina and Chile—have evolved variants around the gene AS3MT, which makes enzymes that break down arsenic in the liver. It is a prime example of natural selection, the evolutionary process by which organisms adapt to their environments to survive longer and produce more offspring. Apparently natural selection among the Uru, Aymara and Quechua peoples of the Bolivian Altiplano took DNA sequences that are present but rare in other populations around the world and increased their frequency to the point where the normally uncommon sequences are predominant in these groups. The case is one of many discoveries of relatively recent biological adaptation that could upend a long-standing idea about the evolution of our species.

For most of the 21st century many evolutionary biologists have assumed that humans evolved at a leisurely pace in recent millennia, in contrast to the dramatic transformations that occurred earlier in our prehistory. The oldest known members of the human family evolved in Africa around six million to seven million years ago and looked apelike in many ways. Our own species, Homo sapiens, arose in Africa a few hundred thousand years ago and began venturing into other parts of the world in significant numbers around 60,000 years ago. By that point our physical appearance seems to have settled into an evolutionary plateau, with only minor differences among human populations around the globe. After natural selection had worked its wonders for millions of years, transforming small-brained quadrupeds into large-brained bipeds, it appeared that biological evolution had slowed to a crawl in our lineage as H. sapiens developed agriculture, founded civilizations and transformed the planet.

Early studies of the DNA of modern people turned up few fixed differences—genetic variants possessed exclusively by one population—which seemed to confirm this apparent stasis. Consequently, many scholars believed that the latest chapter of the human saga revolved around cultural changes rather than biological ones—figuring out more reliable means of obtaining food instead of changing our digestive or metabolic systems, for instance.

But advances in the sequencing of ancient and modern DNA have allowed scientists to look more closely at how our genetic code has evolved over time—and the results are startling. Genetic studies suggest that H. sapiens experienced many major episodes of natural selection in the past few thousand years as our ancestors fanned across the globe and entered new environments containing foods, diseases and toxic substances they had never before encountered. “It shows the plasticity of the human genome,” says Karin Broberg of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, who studies the genetics of susceptibility to environmental toxic substances. “We've spread throughout the world, and we live in very extreme environments, and we're able to make them our homes. We are like rats or cockroaches—extremely adaptable.” This research offers fresh insights into how our species conquered every corner of the planet. We didn't manage this feat through cultural adaptation alone, as some scientists previously supposed. Rather humans continued to evolve biologically to keep pace with the radical changes they were making in their ways of life as they pushed into terra incognita.

To appreciate how these evolutionary changes came about, it helps to know the basics of how DNA is structured and how it can vary among individuals and populations. The human genome contains about three billion nucleotide base pairs, the matched sets of two complementary nucleic acids that form the basic unit of our genetic code. The DNA sequences of people today are extremely similar; we differ on only about one tenth of a percent of the genome, or about one out of 1,000 positions. A difference between two people at any position on the genome is called a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP (pronounced “snip”). A variant of genetic code—which may be a single position or thousands—that differs between individuals is called an allele. In general, human populations share most of the same genetic variation and evolutionary history.

New research raises the possibility that recent human history involved far more dynamic evolution than previously thought.

In Darwinian biology, the classic conception of natural selection is a “hard sweep,” in which a beneficial mutation allows some individuals to survive longer or produce more offspring such that eventually that variant becomes fixed in the population. In the early 2000s, when researchers were starting to look for signs of hard sweeps in the genomes of contemporary peoples, the clearest examples came from populations that had adapted to unique circumstances. For instance, around 42,000 years ago a selective sweep changed a protein on the surface of red blood cells in Africans to boost their resistance to malaria. People in the Tibetan Highlands underwent selective sweeps for genes that helped them tolerate low oxygen (intriguingly, populations of the Himalayas, Andes and Ethiopian highlands adapted to high altitude with different assortments of genes, taking different evolutionary paths to solve similar problems).

Some of the best-known selective sweeps happened in western Eurasia and involved alleles associated with diet, skin pigmentation and immunity. Many of these sweeps are linked to the profound shifts wrought by the transition to agriculture. Around 8,500 years ago early farmers spread an allele that helped them synthesize long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids from plant-based foods. These fatty acids are essential for cell membranes, particularly in the brain, and hunter-gatherers obtained them easily from meat and seafood. The new genetic variant allowed agricultural populations to synthesize them from short-chain fatty acids found in plants. This variant was rare at first, but now it is present in about 60 percent of Europeans.

The Uru people of the Bolivian Altiplano have a gene variant that helps them metabolize the toxic arsenic found in their drinking water.

Likewise, as dairy farming rose, so, too, did a gene variant that helped people consume milk products into adulthood. When Stonehenge was built around 5,000 years ago, virtually no Europeans possessed the genes people need to digest milk as adults. In most mammals—and most human populations—the body ceases producing the milk-digesting enzyme lactase after weaning. Yet around 4,500 years ago a gene that kept the lactase turned on in adulthood began to spread through Europe and South Asia. Another series of sweeps beginning around 8,000 years ago gave Eurasians their distinctive pale complexion. These changes reduced their production of the dark skin pigment known as melanin, which is believed to have allowed more sunlight to penetrate their skin and help them synthesize vitamin D, a nutrient in short supply among early agriculturalists.

These examples of hard sweeps became well known among geneticists, mostly because they seemed so uncommon. In the past two decades studies have found that contemporary human populations have relatively few fixed differences. Many researchers thus concluded that selective sweeps accounted for only a little of the genetic change our species has undergone over the past several thousand years. Most of the change, they proposed, stemmed not from natural selection but from gene flow (when populations interbreed as a consequence of migration) and genetic drift (when a genetic variant becomes more or less prevalent through random chance).

Yet reconstructing the past from genomes of modern-day people is tricky business because evolution often brushes over its own footprints. Early studies relied on the DNA of modern people to make inferences about evolution, but these methods could detect only events that had lasting effects. Episodes of natural selection are sometimes ephemeral, and evidence of them vanishes from our genomes when the selective pressures subside or when populations mix. Now ancient DNA is allowing investigators to find episodes of long-ago selection that have since been overwritten.

The first ancient human genome was sequenced in 2010. Since then, the number of ancient genomes has expanded steadily to more than 10,000 today. With this growing dataset, researchers can conduct more precise analyses of how the three billion positions in the genome have changed in recent millennia in populations around the world. One 2024 study of ancient DNA tracked the genetic changes in Europe amid major migrations and the transition to farming and pastoralism. Researchers analyzed more than 1,600 ancient genomes spanning the time from 11,000 years ago through the Middle Ages, comparing them with more than 400,000 modern genomes from the U.K. Biobank. When they looked at the modern data alone, they found no instances of selection. But when they examined ancient genomes, they found 11 sweeps. And when they divided those ancient genomes into ancestral lineages, they found 21. The lesson: to fully appreciate the extent of natural selection in history, one must look at local populations in narrow windows of time.

Modern Europeans descend from three main ancestral populations: hunter-gatherers who colonized the continent by around 40,000 years ago, early farmers from Anatolia who came into Europe about 8,500 years ago, and pastoralists from the Pontic-Caspian steppe who arrived around 5,000 years ago. In 2022 a research team led by Yassine Souilmi of the University of Adelaide's Australian Center for Ancient DNA examined 1,162 ancient DNA samples from these ancestral lineages and captured snapshots of their genetics before and after they mixed. They scanned the genomes for any regions with unusually low- or high-frequency alleles, signs of ancient sweeps. They found 57 hard sweeps over the past 50,000 years linked to fat storage, metabolism, skin physiology, immunity and neural function—changes collectively believed to represent adaptations to colder climates. None were shared with a comparative population of sub-Saharan Africans, suggesting they originated after our species began spreading beyond its African birthplace into other parts of the world.

One striking finding was a hard sweep on a region of chromosome 6 called major histocompatibility complex class III, or MHC III, in ancient Anatolians. This ensemble of genes encodes proteins involved in immunity, and natural selection usually promotes genetic diversity in that region to defend against an array of potential threats. In this case, however, the researchers were surprised to find just the opposite—what they called a “distinctive trough of genetic diversity”—in that part of the genome, suggesting that these early farmers were ravaged by disease. “The population had been exposed to something so severe that it wiped out all the diversity that is generally favored in that region,” Souilmi says. “It was one of the strongest, if not the strongest, adaptation signals we have ever seen in humans.”

Pathogens such as the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which caused the bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death, have been major drivers of human evolution.

When the Anatolians later mixed with other populations, however, the MHC III adaptation signal disappeared. The researchers found similar patterns in dozens of other cases from the past 50,000 years. Again and again the selection pressures relaxed, and the traces of adaptations that had been widespread were “almost entirely erased from descendant populations” through interbreeding with other groups or genetic drift, Souilmi and his co-authors write in their study. “Such strong positive selection events have been much more common in recent human history than previously recognized,” they conclude.

This finding contradicts the notion that technological innovation and intelligence exempted later H. sapiens from biological adaptation. “It tells us our social fabric and technologies do not necessarily shield us from everything nature has to throw at us,” Souilmi says.

One thing nature regularly throws at us is deadly disease. Human populations have long been locked in an evolutionary arms race with pathogens. In a never-ending cycle, disease-causing microorganisms evolve to exploit vulnerabilities in our immune systems, and we adapt to resist these attacks. Even as ancient humans vanquished dangerous predators, they remained vulnerable to these microscopic enemies. For example, the bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death, which was caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, wiped out 30 to 50 percent of the population of Europe in the 14th century.

In this way pathogens helped shape who we are today. “Where there is mortality, there is selection: individuals who die before reaching reproductive age do not pass on their genes,” says Lluis Quintana-Murci, a population geneticist at the Institut Pasteur in Paris. “Indeed, infectious diseases and pathogens have been major drivers of natural selection throughout human history.”

Those battles became inscribed in our genomes. In a 2023 study, Quintana-Murci and his colleagues analyzed 2,879 ancient and modern genomes to see how the DNA of Europeans changed over the past 10,000 years. They found 139 positions on the genome that had been targeted by strong natural selection—either “positive selection” to promote advantageous genetic variants or “negative selection” to purge harmful ones. These changes largely involved the response to infections. More than 80 percent of the positive selection events began in the past 4,500 years—a time of swelling urban communities, growing dependence on agriculture, proximity to domesticated animals and a rise in epidemics. “Natural selection has been pervasive throughout this period,” Quintana-Murci says.

Some adaptations to infectious pathogens came at a cost, however: strengthening resistance to ancient diseases might have elevated the likelihood of immune overreaction. In other words, a hypervigilant defense system could go haywire and attack one's own body. As the risk of infectious disease dropped, the probability of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders appears to have risen. For example, there was a sharp increase in several genetic variants that protect against infectious illnesses but also raise the risk of inflammatory bowel conditions such as Crohn's disease.

Several variants in the MHC (also known as the human leukocyte antigen, or HLA, region in humans) also appear to have undergone selection to resist pathogens. These same variants increased the risk of autoimmune disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis, an inflammatory disease that can cause the vertebrae to fuse, and type 1 diabetes, in which the immune system attacks the cells in the pancreas that make the hormone insulin. Some parts of the genome showed evidence of negative selection as nature weeded out harmful variants. There was a drop in variants that increase the risk of COVID-19, for instance, suggesting that ancient people battled coronaviruses centuries before the recent pandemic.

Taken together, the results suggest that our immune system has been repeatedly tweaked by recent selection like a software system that requires constant updates. Despite the plethora of new discoveries, Quintana-Murci believes researchers have uncovered only the most obvious examples of ancient selection, and he suspects many more cases will come to light as analytical methods become more powerful and researchers obtain more ancient DNA from other regions of the world. “Many surprises are likely to emerge,” he says.

One big surprise is just how pervasive these adaptations have been. A team led by scientists at Harvard Medical School analyzed more than 8,400 DNA samples from people who lived in western Eurasia during the past 14,000 years. They compared these ancient genomes with genetic data from 6,510 modern people and examined nearly 10 million genetic variants. For each SNP, they computed selection coefficients to measure how much natural selection acted to promote or suppress that variant in the next generation.

In a pre-peer-review draft of the paper released publicly last year, David Reich and his colleagues report that they found evidence for natural selection at 347 places on the genome—an order of magnitude more than previously known. The changes were related to immunity, inflammatory responses and cardio-metabolic traits and most likely reflect adaptations to new diets, more crowded living conditions, diseases and domestic livestock.

Reich declined to discuss the results for this story because the paper is currently under review for publication in a journal, but he disclosed that the team expects to expand the number of samples and strengthen the methodology in the final version of the study. In an interview with podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Reich previewed the findings and described striking shifts in genetic variants over the past 10 millennia: “We think we have many, many hundreds of places where there [have] been very strong changes in frequency over time,” he said. “We think there are many thousands that we can see traces of. The whole genome is seething with these changes in this period.”

The preprint of the paper offers examples. Early farming populations underwent strong selection to abandon the “thrifty genes” that promote body-fat storage. These gene variants had been advantageous for hunter-gatherers who endured times of scarcity, but they became liabilities in the more abundant age of agriculture. Other sweeps forged dramatic genetic changes affecting skin pigmentation; blood type; and susceptibility to diseases such as tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, celiac disease, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

Like the earlier studies, the Harvard study found a hotspot of activity at the MHC/HLA region of the genome (about 20 percent of the signals came from this area). One allele that increases the risk of celiac disease went from being virtually nonexistent to occurring in 20 percent of the population over the course of just 4,000 years. Presumably this allele offered some as yet unknown protective effect that outweighed its attendant risk of celiac disease.

In many cases, the selection was so strong that the variants would have become universal in the population had the selection continued, but then the pressure waned, and the variants lost their evolutionary cachet. In other cases, the populations interbred with other lineages, and the evidence of past selection was masked.

With new analytical techniques, researchers can read these erasures like an ancient palimpsest. “That's the holy grail—having a really powerful method to detect locations in the genome that are very likely to be under selection,” says Ray Tobler, a population geneticist and ancient DNA specialist at Australian National University. “Now the tools we have are very powerful, so we will find a lot more,” he predicts.

One promising area of discovery concerns so-called polygenic traits, which are controlled by multiple genes. Most traits and diseases of interest are polygenic. Traditionally they have proved very difficult to study because they can involve the interplay of hundreds or thousands of positions scattered around the genome, each exerting only a minuscule effect on the trait. Human height, for instance, is estimated to be influenced by more than 100,000 positions. Each individual gene involved in a polygenic trait may exert only a small influence on that trait. This distributed influence can make it hard to identify genetic targets of natural selection. “Human adaptation is a polygenic process, usually with small effect sizes of individual genes,” says Bing Su, a professor at the Kunming Institute of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. But with technological advances that have made it faster and cheaper than ever to sequence high volumes of DNA, he says, scientists now can spot polygenic adaptations that previously were invisible.

These latest genetic studies have opened a new frontier in research into traits that are far more complex than the single-gene-mediated ability to digest milk in adulthood. But not everyone agrees that these traits are necessarily products of natural selection. Perhaps, skeptics have suggested, the observed fluctuations in allele frequencies are just routine oscillations of variants in the gene pool rather than proof positive of natural selection acting to adapt the human body to environmental challenges. Some of the papers have drawn criticism about their statistical methods. Some findings of ancient selection have not been replicated by other studies. The numerous papers reporting more natural selection differ on where in the genome it is occurring.

Iain Mathieson, a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania, is circumspect. He thinks new studies such as the Harvard paper are indeed detecting real shifts in gene frequencies, but he notes that quite a few of them appear to be transient. Mathieson suspects that many genetic variants have been subject to only weak or fleeting selection without much lasting effect. “I mean, that's still selection, but I'm not sure I'd call it directional selection,” he says, referring to the type of natural selection responsible for selective sweeps.

Sasha Gusev, a statistical geneticist and associate professor at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, takes a different view. The new research raises the possibility that recent human history involved far more dynamic evolution than previously recognized, with repeated episodes of selection followed by reversals. “It's a super interesting question that ancient DNA is opening back up,” he says, even if there isn't yet consensus in the field about the extent to which this kind of evolution has occurred.

That consensus may emerge as scientists obtain additional ancient DNA samples and further refine the tools they use to analyze them. The discovery of more hitherto unknown examples of adaptation, meanwhile, seems all but inevitable. Most of the detailed studies of ancient selection have focused on populations in western Eurasia. Much remains to be learned about people in Asia, the Americas, and especially Africa, the birthplace of our species, which holds more human genetic diversity than the rest of the world combined. “While it might seem that we're currently detecting huge amounts of selection, in my opinion we're not detecting enough,” Souilmi says. “I think there is a lot more out there.”

Can Sunlight Cure Disease?

Sunshine may hold healing rays for a variety of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Scientists are turning this surprising discovery into treatments

By Rowan Jacobsen edited by Josh Fischman

Taylor Callery

Every morning Kathy Reagan Young steps out of the shower in her Virginia Beach home, towels off, dons a pair of protective goggles and stands nine inches from a light box the size of a small space heater. Young presses a button, and the box's bulbs begin to glow a ghostly purple. She briefly bathes her torso in the ultraviolet rays coming from the bulbs, four minutes per side. Then she goes about her day.

That Young can have an ordinary day is remarkable. In 2008 she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS), a terrible malady in which the body's own immune system attacks the sheaths that insulate the nerves, destroying them bit by bit. Symptoms begin with weakness, spasms, vision and speech problems, intense fatigue, and what Young calls “cog fog”—chronic low-grade cognitive impairment. Flare-ups can lead to periods of motor-control loss and paralysis. Young, an advocate for MS patients and creator of a popular podcast, has suffered through many such episodes. But things improved with the arrival of her light box.

Ultraviolet (UV) light boxes, which emit only a narrow bandwidth of light that is not linked to skin cancer, have been used for years in the treatment of psoriasis. Young got a prescription from her doctor, and the box was sent to her by a medical-device company called Cytokind that is hoping to expand such use to MS and other autoimmune diseases and was looking for some practical patient feedback. She tried out the device and gave them some pointers: make it smaller and easier to hold because MS often makes your hands go numb, and build in timed reminders to overcome the cog fog. Then, to her surprise, she found that her fatigue disappeared a few months after she started using it.

For years Young had been forced to rest in bed many times a day, but that stopped with what she calls her UV-fueled rebirth. “I was in a meeting, and someone said to me, ‘Wow, you seem like you're pretty high energy!'” Young says. “And I guess I hadn't really thought about it. And then two days later my daughter said to me, ‘Mom, what are you on?' I think we were all a little surprised by how quickly and definitively it happened.” Her MS Disease Activity (MSDA) score, which rates MS severity based on the levels of key inflammatory molecules in the blood, was a 1 out of 10, the best possible score, and it has stayed low for more than a year. MS has no cure, and Young still suffers from transient pain and tingling, but the return of her vitality has made it all more bearable. “It's incredible,” she says. “My friends used to invite me to things, and I'd say yes, but I always canceled because I was wiped out. Well, not anymore.”

Young is one of the first people in the U.S. to test UV phototherapy as an MS treatment, but she may be at the forefront of a revolution in how we think about light and a huge class of diseases. Autoimmune diseases such as MS and type 1 diabetes occur when our natural defenses—our immune systems—viciously turn against our own bodies and organs. These illnesses are estimated to affect more than 350 million people worldwide. Treatments have been elusive.

Although only a handful of clinical trials for MS light therapy have been conducted in people, evidence from a number of medical studies now shows that UV light, the highest-energy part of the solar spectrum that reaches Earth's surface, has a surprising ability to calm an immune system that has bolted out of control. The new studies offer tantalizing hints that UV therapy might also work for other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and colitis. All are more common in people who get very little sun exposure, as are maladies such as Alzheimer's and cardiovascular disease that appear to have some immune system and inflammatory connections.

Now scientists are hoping to decipher the pathways through which UV light causes the immune system to back down from its alarm state. They are tracking the way molecules in the skin such as urocanic acid and lumisterol—which can affect immune system activity—respond to a shot of photons by triggering a cascade of signals that reach every organ in the body. Advocates say this work might lead to a blockbuster drug, an Ozempic for autoimmunity.

“UV light calms inflammation in the skin, the nervous system, the pancreas and the gut. Its potential is not fully realized.” —Prue Hart, Kids Research Institute Australia

Scientists not involved in the light research are more cautious, but they agree that something important is going on. “UV light therapy holds promise,” says Annette Langer-Gould, an MS researcher and neurologist at Kaiser Permanente in Los Angeles. But she would like to see rigorous and larger trials on various diseases and a better understanding of the mechanism.

That kind of confirmation could also solve a mystery that has vexed scientists for more than a century: Why do people living in lower-light environments have such high rates of disease?

The trail that led scientists to the discovery of UV light's beneficial effects began with the confirmation of its dangers. In 1974 pioneering researcher Margaret L. Kripke (who would go on to found the department of immunology at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas) discovered that she could induce tumors in the skin of mice by exposing the rodents to UV light. But those tumors failed to grow when transferred to the skin of a different mouse. The new host's immune system quickly eliminated them. Ten times she tried, and 10 times the tumors were squelched. When she suppressed the new host's immune system with drugs, however, the tumors took hold. “That was the key!” she later recalled.

But why was the tumor able to grow in the original irradiated mouse? Was the UV light that had induced it also somehow suppressing the mouse's natural immune response? In a series of experiments, Kripke determined that UV radiation was indeed a double whammy. Not only did it damage DNA in skin cells and trigger mutations that could lead to cancer, but it also suppressed the immune system's surveillance of the skin, preventing that system from killing any budding cancers. This finding was a breakthrough in our understanding of how skin cancer develops, but it also seemed nonsensical from an evolutionary perspective. How could it possibly be beneficial for our immune system to relax in the presence of a common carcinogen?

It turns out that immune cells in our skin evolved to walk a fine line. As our primary interface with the outer world, the skin is barraged with potential stressors: heat, cold, wounds, bug bites, mysterious microbes of all kinds. For the first million years that our nonape ancestors spent under tropical African skies, solar radiation was the most common stressor of all. “It's a challenge to the body,” says Prue Hart, an immunologist at the Kids Research Institute Australia who has been studying the effects of sunlight on immunity for more than 30 years. “It's the most important environmental insult we have. We evolved to cope with it.”

But if the immune system had reacted to every kiss of sunlight with a full-throated attack, Hart says, we'd have lived in a constant state of inflammation, beset by rashes, hives and cutaneous autoimmune disorders. Instead the system learned to hold its fire.

In prehistoric times, this was the right approach. The damage was usually minor, the skin repaired itself, life went on. The trade-off—especially now that people live long enough for slow-growing tumors to get big and spread to other parts of the body—is that every so often a skin cancer sneaks through. One fascinating confirmation of this idea is polymorphic light eruption (PLE), a common disorder in which patients' immune systems are not suppressed by sunlight. PLE sufferers develop itchy rashes and plaques after sun exposure, but they are less likely to develop skin cancer.

The discovery of UV light's powerful impact on our immune responses launched a brand-new discipline: photoimmunology. Early investigators in this field, such as Kripke, focused on the negative effects of immunosuppression. But they soon found some upsides as well. For example, it finally explained something doctors had noticed for centuries: sunlight soothed psoriasis, a skin condition marked by painful, itchy scales. With the discovery that psoriasis was an autoimmune disease in which the immune system flays the body's own skin cells, it at last made sense. UV light—whether from the sun or a lamp—improved psoriasis by tamping down the inflammatory response.

Remarkably, the effect wasn't just local. Shining light on one patch of inflamed skin could reduce symptoms on other patches. Even more curious, people with psoriasis often suffer from other autoimmune conditions, and sometimes the phototherapy improved their other symptoms as well.

As photoimmunologists probed deeper into the mechanisms, they began to wonder whether the body's response to UV light was more than skin-deep. In the laboratory, they exposed mice to UV radiation and saw their entire immune systems pivot to anti-inflammatory states. In mice with autoimmune diseases, it improved their health. The researchers began comparing notes with epidemiologists, who were documenting signs of the same thing in human populations.

For more than a century scientists have noticed that many diseases, especially autoimmune and cardiovascular conditions, follow a latitude gradient. Once other confounding factors such as diet, exercise and socioeconomics are accounted for, rates of these diseases rise with latitude. All kinds of causes have been suggested—climate, diet, cosmic rays, something in the water—but nothing fit.

In 1940 a physician at the Medical College of Virginia named Frank Apperly showed that American states and Canadian provinces receiving more solar radiation had higher rates of skin cancer mortality but lower rates of cancer mortality overall. Skin cancer was known to be caused by sunlight, but Apperly suggested that something about the sun was also conferring protection against internal cancers. He didn't know what, but in 1980 Johns Hopkins University epidemiologists Frank and Cedric Garland, two brothers who were analyzing maps of cancer incidence produced as part of the government-led “war on cancer,” noticed a strong north-south gradient for colon cancer rates and suggested in a hugely influential paper in the International Journal of Epidemiology that vitamin D was responsible.

Until then, vitamin D had been known mostly as the micronutrient that prevented rickets. It is produced in the skin with the aid of sunlight, and it helps to deliver calcium to bones, making them resistant to fractures. The Garlands suggested that it might do a lot more than that, and indeed, everywhere scientists looked they discovered an inverse correlation between vitamin D levels and the risk of dozens of diseases, including breast cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, stroke, dementia, depression, and several autoimmune disorders.

Thus began the vitamin D era. Doctors around the world recommended supplementation with this new wonder drug, and they still do for people who are seriously deficient in the substance. But as recently chronicled in this magazine, rigorous clinical trials have shown that extra D supplementation—using the vitamin as a treatment—doesn't help with any of these diseases. The maladies afflict people who take supplements and people who don't, in equal measure. Most of us get enough D from just a little sunlight or from our diets: fortified dairy products are good sources, for instance, as are fatty fish such as salmon. Whatever sunshine is doing to prevent myriad ailments, it's a lot more complicated than getting the skin to produce a little vitamin D.

The disease with the most dramatic latitude gradient is MS. Prevalence rates are close to zero near the equator and increase by 3.64 cases on average per 100,000 people for each degree of latitude, reaching well over 100 cases per 100,000 people in northern Europe and North America. The gradient exists worldwide and has been growing stronger over time. It even shows up within individual countries, including France, the U.K., Sweden, New Zealand, Canada and the U.S.

Kathy Reagan Young, who has multiple sclerosis, uses ultraviolet rays from a light box for a few minutes every morning. Since she began treatment, her symptoms have eased notably.

Some of the best data comes from Australia, which is one of the only countries to boast a wide range of latitudes, a relatively homogeneous population and a national health-care system with good recordkeeping. A 1981 study found that rates of MS rose from 12 per 100,000 people in tropical Townsville (19 degrees latitude) to 21 in Brisbane (27 degrees), 37 in Newcastle (33 degrees), and a whopping 76 per 100,000 people in Hobart (43 degrees). The latitude connection was reinforced in the early 2000s, when a study of various environmental factors that might contribute to MS onset found rates several times higher in Australia's higher latitudes.

At the time, says Robyn Lucas, an epidemiologist at the Australian National University who is one of the leaders of the study, many scientists assumed a lack of vitamin D at the higher latitudes was responsible. “Vitamin D was the flavor of the day. Vitamin D was cancer. Vitamin D was cardiovascular disease,” she says. “Vitamin D was autoimmune disease. Vitamin D was everything. And we just thought, ‘Yeah, vitamin D.'”

But in 2010 Lucas read a study showing that UV treatments protected mice against MS without affecting their vitamin D levels. Mice are not always good stand-ins for people, but it was enough to make Lucas curious. “I'd just done the analysis of the vitamin D, and then this paper came out, and I thought, ‘Okay, let's have a look at that,'” she says. “So I went back to our data and actually found a much stronger effect for sun exposure.”

Since then, Lucas and others have found signs of sunlight's preventive effect on MS everywhere they've looked. People with the most sun damage on the back of the hand—a particularly accurate reflection of lifetime sun exposure—have just one-third the rate of MS compared with those with less. And kids who spent less than 30 minutes a day outside had twice the risk of MS compared with those who spent up to one hour outside and about five times the risk of those who averaged more than an hour outside.

Notably, observational studies like these cannot prove causation. There could be other explanations for the patterns. Perhaps people suffering the earliest symptoms of MS spend more time indoors because they're not feeling well. Maybe something else about high-latitude locations contributes to MS. So epidemiologists looked for other supporting evidence, and they found plenty. Even within the same region, MS relapse rates follow a seasonal cycle—higher in winter, when sun is scarce—and incidence rates correspond closely to birth month, being highest in people who experienced winter during their first trimester of gestation, when the brain and immune system are developing.

Additional support came from a small clinical trial by Hart. She recruited 20 patients with clinically isolated syndrome, an early-stage version of MS that eventually leads to full MS. Half the subjects received eight weeks of treatment with a narrowband-UV light box similar to the one Kathy Reagan Young uses, undergoing three sessions per week with each session lasting just a few minutes. The other half didn't get light therapy. Within a week of the first treatment, levels of inflammatory proteins in the UV group's blood dropped, and they stayed lower even after the UV sessions ended. Three months after the beginning of the trial, the UV group's disease-severity scores had fallen 13 percent, whereas the control group's had risen 14 percent. These scores correlated with the subjects' self-reported fatigue. A year after the sessions, all the subjects who didn't get UV therapy had developed full-blown MS, but 30 percent of the UV group had been spared.

The fact that the effect lasted for months after the initial UV treatment was intriguing. Immune cells are constantly being produced in the bone marrow, and they don't last that long, so the UV hadn't just suppressed the immune cells in circulation; it had reset the system to a more tolerant state. “I think UV is part of our innate immune training,” Hart says. “It reprograms subsets of innate immune cells as they evolve out of the bone marrow. They're less inflammatory and more regulatory.”

The idea is similar to recent research showing that early exposure to small amounts of allergens can condition the immune system and prevent a hyperactive response later on. “You get this rebalancing,” Hart says. “UV light calms inflammation in the skin. But it also then calms inflammation in the central nervous system. It'll calm inflammation in the pancreas and the gut. So I think it's not fully realized the potential it has to be a controller of body homeostasis.”

The implications go well beyond MS or even autoimmune diseases. In recent years researchers have learned that many other chronic conditions also have an inflammatory component. Cardiovascular disease is caused in part by immune cells attacking and damaging the walls of blood vessels. Alzheimer's disease is connected to low-grade, smoldering inflammation in the brain. Arthritis, asthma, allergies, diabetes and even depression are thought to have inflammatory components. Something about the modern, indoor, overly hygienic lifestyle may cause our immune systems to lose their healthy set points.

Sun-exposure effects have also been found in some other autoimmune conditions, such as type 1 diabetes, in which the immune system attacks the pancreas, disrupting insulin production. The rate of this disease is threefold higher in southern Australia than in northern Australia. In the U.S., prevalence is lowest in fall babies, who gestated over the summer. But the difference is most pronounced in northern regions and smallest in sunny spots such as Hawaii and southern California.

Taken together, Lucas says, these findings start to make a very convincing case. “We've now shown it in pediatric MS, we've shown it in Crohn's disease, we've shown it in type 1 diabetes,” she says. “There's a consistency of evidence across autoimmune diseases that have a similar immunopathology.”

Given this consistency of evidence, what should we do about it? Although some scientists have argued for increased sun exposure for people at high risk of an autoimmune disease, few health-care providers would ever be comfortable recommending a known carcinogen to their patients. The holy grail, in terms of widespread acceptance, would be to uncover the mysterious molecular pathway through which the skin tells the immune system to relax and then turn it into a biologic—a medication isolated from natural organisms. “What is the Ozempic for autoimmunity?” asks Cytokind co-founder John MacMahon. “Where is it going to come from? Is there something in that photoimmune cascade that can be identified?”

Young strolls in the sunshine near her Virginia home. Her ultraviolet therapy has let her resume her daily activities and minimized many difficulties and pains created by her multiple sclerosis.

“We don't know what the golden molecule is; we just know it's not vitamin D,” Hart says. “So you take a step back and give UV, which gives the skin a chance to make whatever it is.” But a pill would be better than a light box as a treatment, MacMahon says. “People prefer pills,” he says, and doctors prefer prescribing pills, and pharmaceutical companies definitely prefer making pills.

The problem in finding “whatever it is” is that when you do shine UV light on the skin and take a peek to see what it makes, you discover a microscopic pharmacopeia. In addition to vitamin D, the skin produces melatonin, serotonin, endorphins, endocannabinoids, cortisol, oxytocin, leptin, nitric oxide, cis-urocanic acid, itaconate, lumisterol, tachysterol, and a dozen other vitamin D–like compounds that don't even have names yet.

Most of these molecules are hormones or neurotransmitters, and that should come as no surprise. Although many people tend to think of the skin as nothing but a barrier, it's the largest organ in the body and a vital pole of the neuroendocrine system, in constant conversation with the body and brain about how to tune the system to maintain health. It's also a major site for the immune system, stocked with body-defending—or body-attacking, if they go haywire—T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and other key players.

The way UV light stirs this many-flavored stew is both elegant and complex. For example, the body stocks the skin with a precursor to vitamin D called 7-dehydrocholesterol. When the molecule is hit with the right amount of UV energy, one of its bonds breaks, allowing its atoms to flip to a new configuration. But when hit with more UV energy, it flips to a different configuration known as lumisterol, which has been found in the blood in higher concentrations than vitamin D and has known anti-inflammatory and antitumor effects. The skin takes advantage of the bond-breaking power of UV radiation to produce multiple molecules, including cis-urocanic acid and nitric oxide, which lowers blood pressure and reduces inflammation throughout the body.

Other skin cells respond to sunlight by increasing production of pro-opiomelanocortin, a protein that is then cleaved by enzymes into three essential molecules: beta-endorphin, a neurotransmitter that causes feelings of well-being and reduces stress hormones; adrenocorticotropic hormone, which triggers the release of cortisol, a steroid that regulates stress and suppresses inflammation; and the alpha form of melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which repairs damaged cells, inhibits proinflammatory molecules and produces melanin to darken the skin.

Immunologist Scott Byrne of the University of Sydney recently discovered six novel lipids—all with names like acylcarnitine and phosphatidylethanolamine, and no, that will not be on the final test—that are produced by the skin in response to UV light and sent down to the lymph nodes under the skin, where various immune cells meet and exchange information. There they signal T cells—the powerful immune warriors that get out of control in people with MS and attack the nervous system—to stay put and stop proliferating. This pathway is separate from the one that suppresses cancer surveillance in the skin, which means it holds the promise of harnessing the good of UV radiation without the bad.

No one fully understands how this biological pachinko game sorts itself out as all these cells and signals bounce off one another, so the quest for the golden molecule will not be completed tomorrow—and is unlikely to have a simple resolution. “Isn't it naive to think one molecule is going to solve all the health conditions controlled by UV?” Hart says. A single cause would certainly be convenient, “but we evolved under the sun for millions of years. It's probably multiple.”

Likewise, phototherapy itself is unlikely to deliver all the benefits of full-spectrum sunlight, but it doesn't have to. Its safety, simplicity and affordability mean all it has to do is deliver some benefit. “Phototherapy is so cheap relative to biologics,” Hart says. “It's almost a no-brainer as an adjunct treatment for all these inflammatory autoimmune diseases.”

That fact alone has drawn the interest of insurance companies. A UV light box costs about $2,000, whereas adalimumab (Humira), a leading biologic drug for various autoimmune diseases, lists for $80,000 a year and must be taken for life. Inspired by that math, along with clinical trials showing phototherapy to be as effective as some medications with fewer side effects, Kaiser Permanente provided 2,200 of its psoriasis patients with free at-home UV light boxes as an experiment. Fewer than a third of them went on to use biologics. Kaiser Permanente now lists at-home UV as a recommended treatment for psoriasis.

But Langer-Gould, the MS expert at Kaiser Permanente, says that although she'd be interested to see whether the light boxes the insurer uses for psoriasis would be helpful for MS, it's too soon to make that leap. “Hart's data are very encouraging,” she says. “But the current evidence is not enough to conclude a definitive treatment effect and recommend widespread use. We need at least one more study.” That study would have to be a clinical trial large enough to show a significant improvement in patients' underlying conditions. Cytokind is currently pursuing such a study, but the results are probably still years away.

In the meantime, the flexibility of phototherapy will allow Young and other converts to fashion their own healing protocols—independence that becomes all the more precious when you have a debilitating disease. “MS robs you of so much,” Young says. “You can't get out of bed, can't go to work, can't clean your house, can't get your groceries. You've got to find rides just to go to the doctor.” For now, at least, she has traded all that for busy days of weight training, yoga, charity work, live chats, guided meditations—and a few minutes of UV light every morning. “It's just so empowering,” she says. “To find a treatment that lets you actually take care of yourself is kind of amazing.”

Mitochondria Are More Than Powerhouses—They're the Motherboard of the Cell

When these energy-giving organelles thrive, so do we

By Martin Picard edited by Madhusree Mukerjee

Jennifer N.R. Smith

I always wanted to understand life. What moves us? What allows us to heal and thrive? And what goes wrong when we get sick or when we eventually stop breathing and die? My search for answers to these stupendously ambitious questions led me, it now seems inexorably, to mitochondria.

In biology classes from high school through university, I learned that mitochondria are little objects that reside within each cell and serve as “powerhouses,” combining oxygen and food to yield energy for the body. This idea of mitochondria being little batteries with a built-in charger, about as interesting as the one in my phone, left me unprepared for the vital reality of these organelles when I first saw them under a microscope in 2011. They were luminous because of a glowing dye I had put in them, and they were dynamic—constantly moving, stretching, morphing, touching one another. They were beautiful. That night, a graduate student alone in a dark laboratory in Newcastle upon Tyne in England, I became a mitochondriac: hooked on mitochondria.

A profound insight by biologist Lynn Margulis helped me make some sense of what I was seeing. She postulated in 1967 that mitochondria descend from a bacterium that was engulfed by a larger ancestral cell about 1.5 billion years ago. Instead of consuming this tidbit, the larger cell let it continue living within. Margulis called this event endosymbiosis, which means, roughly, “living or working together from the inside.” The host cell had no energy source that used oxygen—which, thanks to plants, was already abundant in the atmosphere; mitochondria filled this gap. The unlikely union allowed cells to communicate and cooperate and let their awareness expand beyond their own boundaries, enabling a more complex future in the form of multicellular animals. Mitochondria made cells social, binding them in a contract whereby the survival of each cell depends on every other one, and thus made us possible.

Amazingly, my co-workers and I have discovered that mitochondria are themselves social beings. At least, they foreshadow sociality. Like the bacterium they descended from, they have a life cycle: old ones die out, and new ones are born out of existing ones. Communities of these organelles live within each cell, usually clustered around the nucleus. Mitochondria communicate, both within their own cells and among other cells, reaching out to support one another in times of need and generally helping the community flourish. They produce the heat that keeps our bodies warm. They receive signals about aspects of the environment in which we live, such as air pollution levels and stress triggers, and then integrate this information and emit signals such as molecules that regulate processes within the cell and, indeed, throughout the body.

When our mitochondria thrive, so do we. When they malfunction—when, for instance, their ability to change energy into forms required for biochemical reactions is impaired—we may experience conditions as diverse as diabetes, cancer, autism and neurodegenerative disorders. And as mitochondria accumulate defects over a lifetime of stress and other insults, they contribute to aging and, ultimately, death. To understand these processes—to see how to sustain physical and mental health—it helps to understand how energy moves through our bodies and minds. That requires a deeper look into mitochondria and their social lives.

Long before I got my first glimpse of mitochondria, I had boned up on the basics of their structure and biology. We inherit our mitochondria from our mother—from the egg cell, to be precise. Mitochondria have their own DNA, which consists of only 37 genes, compared with the thousands of genes in the spiraling chromosomes inside the cell nucleus. This ring of mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA, is sheltered within two membranes. The outer shell, shaped like the skin of a sausage, encases the mitochondrion and selectively allows molecules to enter or exit. The inner membrane is made of densely packed proteins and has many folds, called cristae, which serve as a site for chemical reactions, much like the plates suspended inside a battery.

Rather than being like battery chargers, mitochondria are more like the motherboard of the cell.

In the 1960s British biochemists Peter Mitchell and Jennifer Moyle discovered how electrons derived from carbon in food combine with oxygen in the cristae, releasing a spark of energy that is captured as a gradient in electrical voltage across the membrane. This voltage provides the driving force for all processes in the body and brain, from warming to manufacturing molecules to thinking. Mitochondria also produce a molecule called adenosine triphosphate, which serves as a portable unit of energy that powers hundreds of biochemical reactions within each cell.

Returning from the U.K., I started a postdoctoral fellowship with geneticist and evolutionary biologist Douglas Wallace at the Center for Mitochondrial and Epigenomic Medicine at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. In 1988 Wallace had discovered the first-ever link between a mutation in mtDNA and a human disease. He had gone on to map some of mitochondrial biology's fundamental connections to various diseases and the aging process, laying the foundation of the field of mitochondrial medicine. In Philadelphia, I began working with a fellow postdoc, Meagan McManus, who wanted to understand how defective mitochondria could cause cardiovascular and neurological diseases. McManus asked me to photograph with an electron microscope the mitochondria in the hearts of mice with a specific mtDNA mutation that led to heart failure.

Our team was also experimenting with three-dimensional imaging using electron tomography, the same technology that allows a radiologist to see a patient's internal organs in 3D. Weeks later, the director of this project, Dewight Williams of the University of Pennsylvania, brought me to a room where the million-dollar tomography microscope stood, as high as the ceiling, to show me reconstructed movies of mitochondria.

The tomography gave us a 3D view of the cristae. Some mitochondria in the hearts of the sick mice had jagged, highly irregular cristae—the unhealthy look I had been seeing in the 2D pictures. But one thing showed up in 3D that we had never seen in the flat images: even when mitochondria looked unhealthy, their cristae looked healthy at places where the mitochondria touched one another. They were interacting, helping one another's internal organization. These mito-mito junctions also had more cristae than any other part of the same mitochondrion. “Meagan has to see this!” I thought, rushing to the lab across campus.

As I restarted the movie for McManus, I narrated what I had seen a few minutes earlier: “Mitochondria are influencing one another!” We watched the looping video a few times. Then McManus said, her voice pitched high with excitement, “And the cristae line up! The cristae line up between mitochondria!” She drew a line with her extended finger across a junction between mitochondria.

Jennifer N. R. Smith

I had pored over thousands of electron microscopy images from the best microscopists. Never had I heard about cristae in one mitochondrion aligning with the cristae of another mitochondrion. While in Newcastle, I had seen a 1983 paper by Russian scientists Lora E. Bakeeva and Vladimir P. Skulachev describing “intermitochondrial contacts,” and I had demonstrated that these contacts increased after exercise—perhaps increasing energy efficiency. How had we all missed the alignment? Yet instead of lying there as parallel plates, like textbooks often portrayed them, the cristae formed parallel ribbons undulating across mitochondria. It almost looked like the cristae were helping their neighbors organize to achieve the typical, healthy, regular array.

At the next lab meeting, I suggested that these patterns looked like iron filings aligned around a magnet. Cristae are full of iron-sulfur clusters that may be paramagnetic. If they are, maybe there were electromagnetic fields induced by the flow of electrical charge across the cristae? Could they induce the cristae to line up? So far this hypothesis appears to be the best one for how cristae align across mitochondria. For me, it also opened the door to thinking about how the forces of physics might have contributed to the evolution of multicellular life—all the way to us.

This discovery and the thoughts it spurred changed my view of mitochondria forever. Hundreds of hours in the dark dungeon where I studied mitochondria and numerous collaborations later, I had learned one important lesson: mitochondria exchange information. The fingerprint of that exchange lay right there in the patterns of their cristae. Further studies at the University of Tsukuba in Japan and elsewhere, using cells with varying levels of mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mtDNA mutations, showed that healthy mitochondria can donate intact mtDNA to mutant mitochondria. In conditions of scarce energy supply, mitochondria fuse with one another into long strands to share mtDNA. Isolated mitochondria without mtDNA or with mutated mtDNA can similarly fuse with healthy mitochondria, restoring their normal function.

Jennifer N. R. Smith

Fusion enhances the resilience not only of mitochondria but also of cells; interfering with these interactions leads to isolated mitochondria that accumulate mtDNA defects and ultimately die, along with the cells they live in. In people, decreased levels of mitofusin 2, a protein located in the outer mitochondrial membrane that helps with fusion, are correlated with neurodegeneration. And mice with mitochondria that have been engineered to impede fusion in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region involved in regulating reward, are more anxious.

Could there be yet other ways in which mitochondria communicate? Could they act like their bacterial ancestors, which build biofilms and use membrane protrusions, electrical fields and secreted molecules to cooperate and conquer the living world with their versatile collective behaviors? Could mitochondrial communication reveal a broader internal universe of energy and information exchange? Could mitochondrial junctions and aligned cristae operate like neuronal synapses, with the resulting mitochondrial collective behaving essentially like an intracellular brain?

In 2016, shortly after starting my own lab at Columbia University, I was back in Newcastle on a visit to Doug Turnbull's Wellcome Center for Mitochondrial Research. I was again sitting at the electron microscope, this time with a stellar British graduate student, Amy Vincent. We were imaging muscle from the calf of a woman with an mtDNA mutation that caused a rare mitochondrial disease. By coincidence, her mutation was similar to the one McManus's mice had had.

What Vincent and I found that afternoon opened another avenue of inquiry. In front of our eyes lay mitochondrial nanotunnels: thin membrane protrusions—the same kind that bacteria use to share their circular DNA! For the first time in humans, Vincent and I saw that mitochondria send thin tubular structures out toward one another, like feelers that some solitary cells use to search for a more hospitable environment or a healthy fellow cell. By imaging dozens of other muscle samples, we found that people whose mitochondria don't work well have more nanotunnels. It was as if unhealthy mitochondria with mtDNA mutations were reaching out for help.

Jennifer N. R. Smith

Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the mitochondrial collective, however, is that mitochondria from different parts of the body talk to one another, using hormones as their language. Mitochondria produce the steroid hormones we use for sustaining and reproducing life. Cortisol, the hormone that increases blood glucose levels to fuel the stress response, is made in the mitochondria of the adrenal glands, which sit on top of the kidneys. Testosterone, estrogen and progesterone are synthesized mainly by mitochondria in the reproductive organs. Interestingly, brain mitochondria have receptors to sense both stress and sex hormones. So we have a population of mitochondria in the adrenal glands that signal directly, via the blood, to mitochondria in the brain.

Further, mitochondria are not all created equal. In the same way that humans develop specialties in different social and economic roles and organs specialize in executing complementary functions (the liver feeds other organs, the heart pumps, the brain integrates information and issues directives), mitochondria also specialize. Across organs and cell types, mitochondria look different. Their protein contents are different. They move differently. And their ability to sense, integrate and signal specific information varies according to the cell they inhabit. Mitochondrial specialization most likely affords gains in efficiency, allowing an organism to survive at a lower overall energy cost.

My co-workers and I recently built the first map of mitochondria in the human brain. Even within this single organ there are different types of mitochondria in different parts of the cortex and in deeper, subcortical brain regions. The brain uses 20 percent of the body's energy, despite constituting only 2 percent of the body's mass, so an efficient source of power is critical to its functioning. My colleagues, notably, Michel Thiebaut de Schotten of the French National Center for Scientific Research and Eugene V. Mosharov of Columbia, and I found that the more recently evolved brain areas, which have the highest energy expenditure, have mitochondria that are more strongly specialized for energy transformation.

Mitochondria within a cell may also look very different from one another. For example, in neurons, “dendritic” mitochondria are found in the fibers, or dendrites, through which neurons receive signals from other cells. These mitochondria are stable filaments that stretch over 10 to 30 microns—a stupendously long distance for this type of structure—and have several mtDNA copies. “Axonal” mitochondria move along the linear axons, which conduct signals to other neurons, as if they were cellular highways. They are generally short and stubby (up to a micron in length), and many lack mtDNA. “Cytoplasmic” mitochondria cluster around the nucleus and look like something between the dendritic and axonal types. Similar grouping and specialization of mitochondria exists in muscle and fat cells.

These findings, taken together, led behavioral neuroscientist Carmen Sandi of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and me to propose in 2021 that mitochondria are social organelles. If you are like me and your eyebrow rises when you hear the term “social” applied to a subcellular organelle, you are having a normal reflex. Nevertheless, Sandi and I argue that mitochondria show all the features of social beings—a shared environment inside the cell or body, communication, formation of groups or types, synchronization of behavior, interdependence, and specialization in the tasks they perform.

In a subsequent paper, which required a painfully long review of more than 400 studies, Orian S. Shirihai of the University of California, Los Angeles, and I established that the mitochondrial collective operates as a mitochondrial information-processing system, or MIPS. Like the animals they exist within and support, which must respond flexibly to the environment, the mitochondria sense signals, integrate this information in the membrane potential of their cristae, and produce signals that regulate the genes of the cell and shape cell behavior.

Your eyes transform light into electrical impulses that coalesce into an image in your visual field, and your ears transform air-pressure waves into electrical pulses that you eventually perceive as sounds. Likewise, mitochondria transform dozens of hormonal, metabolic, chemical, and other information streams into their electrical membrane potential. This “bioenergetic” state then leads to the production of secondary messenger molecules that are intelligible to the nucleus. So in the same way you read messages on your phone, which receives signals, transforms them and projects decipherable information onto its screen, the nucleus of your cells can “read” the environment through the MIPS that surrounds it.

Rather than having supplementary roles like those of battery chargers, mitochondria are more like the motherboard of the cell. Genes sit inert in the nucleus until energy and the right message come along to turn some of them on and some others off. Mitochondria provide these messages, speaking the language of the epigenome—the malleable layer of regulation that sits on top of the genome to regulate its expression.

My colleague Timothy Shutt of the University of Calgary likes to call mitochondria the “CEO of the cell”: the chief executive organelle. This metaphor captures how mitochondria not only are involved in integrating information but also give orders. They dictate whether the cell divides, differentiates or dies. Indeed, mitochondria have a veto on cell life or death. If the MIPS deems it necessary, it triggers programmed cell death, or apoptosis—a form of self-sacrifice for the greater good of the organism.

So vital are mitochondria that in difficult times cells may donate entire mitochondria to other cells. “In cellular emergencies, newly arrived mitochondria might kick-start tissue repair, fire up the immune system or rescue distressed cells from death,” journalist Gemma Conroy noted in a Nature news story last April. Inside tumors, cancer cells and immune cells appear to compete for mitochondria, using them as a kind of bioweapon. An international effort I participated in, led by Jonathan R. Brestoff of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, recently created an entirely new lexicon to guide the emerging field of mitochondria transfer and transplantation.

All well and good, you may think. What does all this mean for my health or how long I'm going to live?

The short answer is that it may have everything to do with human health. Diabetes, neurodegenerative conditions, cancer and even mental health illnesses are all emerging as metabolic disorders involving malfunctioning mitochondria. And these findings are indicating new routes for intervention.

Mitochondria drive health—or disease—in several ways. One route derives from their role as energy processors. In an electrical circuit, if we crank up the input voltage too much, we can blow it out. Similarly, if our cells are exposed to too much glucose or fat—or, worse, both together, causing what doctors refer to as glucolipotoxicity—the mitochondria undergo fission and fragment into little bits, accumulate mtDNA defects, and produce signals that end up prematurely aging or killing the cell. Experiments in cells and in mice have shown that pharmacologically or genetically preventing mitochondrial fission induced by excessive glucose and fats may protect against insulin resistance.

Cancer, too, may be a disorder of cellular metabolism. Cancer cells can burn glucose without oxygen, which suggests either that something is wrong with their mitochondria or that they prefer to reserve mitochondria for use in cell division—and proliferation.

A second pathway is through mitochondria's influence on gene expression. Mitochondrial signals alter the expression of more than 66 percent of genes in the nuclear chromosomes. By changing which genes are expressed and to what extent, mutations in mtDNA may completely alter the nature, behavior and stress resilience of cells and ultimately of the whole organism.

Mitochondria can look terribly odd when sick. In people with mtDNA defects that cause rare mitochondrial diseases, such as the person in whose mitochondria we first saw nanotunnels, the cristae in particular can look somewhat alien—like crop circles with regular angles, paracrystalline inclusions, and other weird shapes.

Jennifer N. R. Smith

Notably, abnormal mitochondrial shape and function are emerging as biomarkers and potential causes of cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and others. Clinically, a neurobiological subtype of autism spectrum disorder involves defects in mitochondrial biology.

A third pathway is inflammation. When cells are injured or stressed, they may leak mtDNA into the cell's interior, the cytoplasm, or even into the blood. Along with Caroline Trumpff of Columbia, Anna Marsland and Brett Kaufman of the University of Pittsburgh, and other co-workers, I found that mental stress induced by having to speak in public for five minutes increased the amount of free-floating mtDNA in the blood. People in intensive care units who are grievously ill tend to have very high levels of mtDNA in their blood. Because mtDNA rings resemble bacterial DNA, immune cells see them as pathogens and mount an attack that can develop into inflammation. And inflammation, clinicians know well, is linked to the onset and progression of a host of chronic health conditions.

Just how defective mitochondria lead to illness in the body and mind is a question that has yet to be answered. But there are simple ways to ensure our mitochondria stay healthy. One is exercise. When you move vigorously, your cells consume energy rapidly, powering up the membrane potential of your mitochondria. If your exercise leaves you feeling out of breath, it is a sign that your mitochondria are working hard. Because the brain-body entity is expert at anticipating and preparing for the future, if you move in a way that activates your mitochondria, your body thinks, “Next time this happens, I'll be ready!” To get ready, it makes more mitochondria and keeps them working at their best.

Surprisingly, social connections, too, may promote the health of our brain mitochondria. In a major study led by David A. Bennett of Rush Medical College in Chicago, researchers asked hundreds of individuals aged 65 and older in the Chicago area to fill out surveys, take cognitive tests and give blood every year until they died. After death their brains were collected to enable analysis of their mitochondria. My colleague Trumpff used those data to ask whether positive mental states such as feeling purpose in life, optimism and a sense of connectedness—or, in contrast, negative mental states such as perceived stress, depression and social isolation—could be related to the mitochondria's ability to transform energy.

What Trumpff learned was remarkable: the amount of energy-transforming proteins in mitochondria in the prefrontal cortex was significantly correlated with how many positive and negative experiences people reported in the year before they died. This finding aligned with previous studies relating early-life adversity or daily mood markers such as feelings of love, closeness or trust to mitochondria in blood immune cells. Our states of mind might affect the biology of our mitochondria, modulating how well they transform energy.

Another intervention that can be remarkably effective is diet. Medical ketogenic therapy or “nutritional ketosis,” which involves cutting out all refined sugars, limiting intake of carbohydrates, and making up the calorie difference with more proteins and fats, has been shown to sustainably reverse insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The ketogenic diet has been used for decades to ward off seizures and thereby “stabilize” the brain in children and adults with intractable and otherwise incurable epilepsy. A ketogenic diet can even ameliorate the mental state and cognitive function of people with Alzheimer's. It enhances brain-network stability, a marker of brain aging—and this function may explain why some people on the diet sleep better.

The ketogenic diet can have astonishing effects in other diseases as well, as evinced by the story of Lauren Kennedy West, a Canadian woman diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disease at the age of 25. Her life progressively felt too difficult to navigate, “like there was no space for me in the world,” she explained in a moving account of her journey posted on YouTube last year. In December 2023 West began nutritional ketogenic therapy. A couple of weeks later, she noticed she had more energy. Many of her symptoms lessened. After about nine months she was symptom-free, had tapered her medication in collaboration with her care team, and continued to feel better. Late in 2024 she took her last dose of antipsychotic medication.

West's experience parallels initial positive results from a pilot trial of 21 people with bipolar disease and schizophrenia. Numerous other clinical trials of the ketogenic diet for people with severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder are currently in progress around the world. (Many of these trials are by funded by the Baszucki Group, a philanthropic foundation formed after Matt Baszucki, the son of the group's founders, successfully treated his bipolar disease with the ketogenic diet. In 2024 I received the Baszucki Prize in Science, which helps to fund my lab at Columbia.)

A new study of 28,995 people in the U.S., 4,484 of whom had significant depression symptoms, also supports the protective effects of low-sugar diets on mental health. People whose diet was “more ketogenic”—low in carbohydrates and sugars relative to lipids and proteins—were less than half as likely to develop depression compared with people whose diet was fairly rich in sugars.

How does it work? From a mitocentric perspective, the ketogenic diet does three things. First, it leads to the supply of an efficient fuel source by the liver, which feeds other organs in the body. If you fast or eat a ketogenic diet, your liver takes the fats from your love handles or your food and breaks them down into smaller bits called ketone bodies. This process happens inside the liver's mitochondria. Second, after entering the blood, ketone bodies reach the organs, some of which, including the brain, prefer ketone bodies over other fuels such as glucose, proteins and fats. So in the presence of various fuel sources, the brain will preferentially burn ketones.

The third thing may have to do with efficiency—and might explain why ketone bodies are the preferred fuel for the brain. Glucose has to traverse a number of hurdles before getting to neuron mitochondria—it detours through astrocytes, crosses several membranes and goes through several enzymatic reactions. In contrast, ketone bodies are taken up directly by the mitochondria in neurons, where they are burned. It's a far less convoluted path.

So ketosis, or the burning of ketone bodies, may exert its effects on the brain by enabling energy to directly flow between mitochondria. Ketones in your blood open a stream of communication between producer and consumer mitochondria, fostering their sociality throughout your body.

Once we regard mitochondria as dynamic energy and information processors, an entirely new perspective of life emerges. Think of yourself as a waterfall. The waterfall exists only insofar as the water molecules keep flowing down. You learn as much about the waterfall when you scoop up a few inert H2O molecules as you learn about how healthy a person is by sequencing their genome: close to nothing.

The waterfall cannot be understood from its parts, only from its movement. And once the flow stops, there is no more waterfall. The waterfall is not a thing that appears and disappears. It is a process—a process that flows and stops flowing. Like a waterfall, you are not a thing. You are a process—an energetic process, to be precise.

Your fundamentally energetic nature has two main implications. The first is that as a dynamic process, you are bound to change. Your body continually sheds, kills and makes cells. Your mind also changes. Some parts of your mind, such as your personality, are relatively stable. But then again, that can change, too—when you are “hangry,” for instance, and become less than your best self. That's an energy deficit changing your mind.

Some drugs can dramatically change your mind. Psychedelics, for example, act on the serotonin system to desynchronize the human brain. They also dissolve the sense of self, or “ego.” Change brain-energy patterns, change the mind. The mind, then, may essentially be an energy pattern. Further, energy flowing through your brain somehow feels like something. As Nirosha Murugan of Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario and I recently postulated in a paper, humans may be wired to experience excessive resistance to energy flow as aversive. In contrast, smoothly flowing energy, as occurs after an enjoyable exercise session or when you are working on a stimulating project, feels good. When energy ceases flowing to your brain—if your heart stops, for example—your conscious awareness quickly fades, and you no longer are.

Does all this say anything useful about my original questions? I suspect we now have answers. The key to life and health may lie in how easily energy flows through your mitochondria with each breath you take. So next time you skip that appealing sugary treat, go outside for a stroll, hit the gym or decide to spend time with someone you care about, know that you are supporting your mitochondria. Keeping energy flowing through your mitochondrial collective may be the key to good health and a meaningful life.

The Neuroscience of Murderbot's Cyborg Brain

What would it take to create a cyborg brain like the one in the new TV show Murderbot? The answer reveals what makes our own brain so unique

By Allison Parshall edited by Clara Moskowitz

Alexander Skarsgård in Apple TV+'s Murderbot

Apple TV+

Murderbot, the titular character of a new television show on Apple TV+, doesn't do much murdering. Instead it enjoys the freedom of having hacked its governor module, the internal control system that punished it for disobeying orders from its corporate owners. Now you could say it's “quiet quitting”: slacking off by watching its favorite soap operas on the job and trying to keep the humans under its protection from realizing that it's gone rogue.

The show, based on a book series by Martha Wells called The Murderbot Diaries, features a main character made of cloned human tissue and robot hardware. It isn't a human, and it isn't a bot; it's something in-between called a “construct.” It can see with security cameras or with its eyes; it can talk to computer systems with code and humans with language; its digital memory can be wiped by its creators, but its biological memory clings to traumatic flashes that can't be purged. It does not always understand human emotions, yet it feels, deeply.

Exactly how this integration of cloned human neural tissue and computer circuitry works, we don't know—and the creators of the TV version told me that they don't know either. Wells, the books' author and a consulting producer on the show, keeps it vague. “[Wells] likes playing with the possibilities, but her world creation isn't so intensely detailed that we don't get to find our way through it ourselves,” says Chris Weitz, who adapted the series for TV along with his brother, Paul Weitz.

For me, a Murderbot fan and brain science nerd, “finding my way through it” involved talking to neuroscientists to understand how this seamless integration of brain and computer might work—because mixing brains and computer circuitry is not only science fiction. “It's a very cool idea that we're moving toward in many ways,” says Alexander Huth, a neuroscientist at the University of Texas at Austin (and fellow Murderbot fan). And as neuroscientists get better at linking up our minds with computers, they're revealing some of what is so unique, and confounding, about the human brain and how we consciously experience the world.

On the surface, it seems like brains and computers should be compatible enough—both work using electricity. Scientists have been using electricity to interact with the brain since 1924, when the psychiatrist Hans Berger first used electrodes to measure brainwaves. Fifty years later the first brain-computer interfaces used electrical readouts to affect the outside world—by controlling a cursor on a computer screen or, in the case of one avant-garde composer, converting brainwaves into music.

Today brain-computer interfaces are far more advanced. Electrodes implanted inside the brain (or in some cases, simply sitting outside the scalp) pick up subtle patterns of neuron activation in the parts of the brain that generate movement and speech to guide prosthetic limbs or allow people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to communicate, respectively. Some researchers are working on devices to bypass spinal cord injuries to send signals from the brain to paralyzed limbs.

And, increasingly, researchers are feeding the brain sensory information with computers, too, by developing prosthetic limbs that send physical sensations of touch back to the brain. Retinal implants for vision, similar to cochlear implants for hearing, are being developed to send visual information directly to the brain for some people who have lost their sight as a result of a condition called retinitis pigmentosa. And some groups are developing brain prosthetics to restore vision by directly stimulating its visual processing centers. It's still pretty low-resolution, Huth says, but “this is happening.”

None of these advances will allow scientists to create a bot-human construct like Murderbot anytime soon. In fact, the deeper you get into this research, the more it becomes clear why: although both run on electricity, human brains and computers have entirely different strategies for processing information.

Take a classic sci-fi trope that happens to be one of Murderbot's core abilities: seeing a digital display in its mind's eye. What would it take to beam an episode of TV into someone's head?

“We don't really know,” Huth says. The most obvious method involves sticking electrodes into the region at the back of the brain, called the primary visual cortex, which first processes visual information from the eyes. But there's a problem. “You'd need millions and millions and millions of electrodes to be able to read in a high-resolution image into your brain. And that's not plausible, at least in the near term,” Huth says. Some researchers are getting around this problem by forgoing the high-resolution details entirely. They're experimenting with stimulating higher-level visual regions that process more abstract information, such as faces. “You would have the experience that there's a face” even without seeing all the details, Huth explains.

The problem, says neuroscientist Rodrigo Quian Quiroga, is that the brain is an abstraction machine. Unlike a computer, it isn't set up to care about the details. We forget the details of most of what we experience—in fact, we never commit them to memory at all. “The human brain doesn't want to remember. It wants to understand, which is very different,” says Quiroga, who studies visual perception and memory at the University of Leicester in England. He explains that most of what we remember perceiving is a construction rebuilt from a few pillars of meaning that we determine are important. Vision, memory and consciousness are all built from sparse details. “The big principle of brain function, for me, is that it's all a construction,” Quiroga says.

Computers, on the other hand, encode every single bit of information. Unlike a human, who would likely remember only the gist of what they've experienced, “a computer can play [Blade Runner] from beginning to end without any errors,” Quiroga says.

Might a brain-computer interface one day exist that can augment your brain to play back the entirety of Blade Runner (or Murderbot's favorite soap opera, The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon) in your mind's eye? Maybe. “Imagine that this is possible. Do you want that—because one of the key features of how the brain works is that we forget a lot of things,” Quiroga says. This prevents us from getting lost in endless unimportant details. “If it works like that, it's because of millions of years of evolution. So there might be a reason for it,” he warns.

Though brains may never work like computers, computers are increasingly working more like brains. “ChatGPT is much more brainlike than a laptop,” says Huth, who studies the human language system. Artificial intelligence large language models are “a really good match to how our brains represent information and language—the best that we have,” he says. Scientists are also developing computer hardware that mimics neuronal circuitry. And some have tried hooking AI hardware up to brain organoids, or cultured clumps of neurons grown in a lab, to process information.

It's no wonder, then, that Murderbot strikes a chord now. All the way back to Frankenstein, science fiction has reflected our deep cultural fears about the technology we're currently birthing. “On a certain level [Murderbot's story is] topical because people are preoccupied with AI,” show co-creator Paul Weitz says.

But Murderbot caught his attention because “it felt like a great literary character more than anything else.” Chris Weitz adds: “[Murderbot] sort of flips the trope—we're so used to the idea of this artificial person who wants to be human and wants to experience human emotions. And [Wells's] character, which is brilliant, doesn't want to do that.”

Murderbot isn't human. That much it makes very clear to everyone who projects that desire onto it. But it is nonetheless a person, and that reality can't be changed even by those who seek to control it. It's that “irreducibility of personhood,” Paul Weitz says, that drives the story. “That to me was the huge, beautiful lesson in it.”

It was believed a copy when purchased in 1946 for $27.50.

Here's what you'll learn in this story:

An original version of the Magna Carta—considered one of the most important documents in all of history—was sitting (unbeknownst to anyone) within the Harvard Law School Library. Believed for decades to be a copy, a pair of British scholars recently uncovered that it is, in fact, the real deal.

The team came across the document—which had been labled “HLS MS 172”—while doing other research. Now, they believe this copy to be one of the last Magna Carta originals to have ever been created. 

“My reaction was one of amazement and, in a way, awe that I should have managed to find a previously unknown Magna Carta,” David Carpenter, professor of medieval history at King's College London, told the Associated Press. “First, I'd found one of the most rare documents and most significant documents in world constitutional history. But secondly, of course, it was astonishment that Harvard had been sitting on it for all these years without realizing what it was.”

Harvard had purchased what was believed to have been a copy of the Magna Carta created in 1327 from London bookseller Sweet & Maxwell for $27.50 in 1946 . It carried out an inconspicuous existence in the library since then, until Carpenter took notice of it in December of 2023 and sent images to Nicholas Vincent—a medieval history professor at the University of East Anglia in Britain—asking what he thought. Upon taking a look at the document, Vincent agreed that this was more than a mere copy. “You know jolly well what that is,” Carpenter said Vincent told him, according to Harvard Magazine. “It's clearly an original. It's not a copy.” 

Vincent let Harvard know what they had, but their response was “lukewarm,” at best. “I think they may have thought I was a lunatic, actually,” he said. 

Still, he and Carpenter worked with the library to authenticate the work, using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging to reveal faded writing. The duo compared it to the six other known original copies from 1300 to confirm word-for-word matches in the writing and identical handwriting styles—right down to elongated letters. 

The handwriting and 19-by-19-inch size fit with the other 1300 Magna Cartas, and even the text stated it was from the “28th year of Edward's reign,” linking it directly to 1300. 

“It was quite nerve-wracking,” Carpenter said about the authentication process, “but the merciful thing is, at the end, Harvard Law School passed the exam with flying colors.” 

The Magna Carta was first issued in 1215—a powerful document that placed a rule of law on English monarchs. That original document, signed by King John, established due process and habeas corpus, and has served as the basis for some of the world's most foundational documents, including the U.S. Constitution. 

The Magna Carta was reissued five times—known as “confirmations”—between 1215 and the final confirmation in 1300. Carpenter said that well over 30 were created in 1300 by King Edward I and sent across the country with his seal, but only six were thought to have survived. The 1300 Magna Carta has small differences from other versions, and the changes are found in every 1300 original, Carpenter said, which was helpful when comparing the Harvard document to the others. 

“It's one of the world's most valuable documents,” Carpenter said. And that's both historically and monetarily, as a 1297 version sold in 2007 for a whopping $21.3 million.

The scholars wanted to establish how a document sold in a London bookshop in the 1940s could trace back to 1300. The pair was able to find that a World War I flying ace—Air Vice-Marshal Forster Sammy Maynard, CB—sold the document via a Sotheby's auction in 1945. London bookseller Sweet & Maxwell bought the document, and then sold it to the Harvard Law School Library in 1946. 

Vincent said that Maynard's grandson told him that the pilot had inherited historical documents from Thomas and John Clarkson—leaders of a campaign against the British slave trade. Clarkson was acquainted with William Lowther, the hereditary lord of the manor of Appleby, which was one of the places a 1300 confirmation was sent. It was known to still be there in 1762, making this likely the same document. 

“There's a chain of connection there, as it were, a smoking gun,” Vincent said, “but there isn't any clear proof as yet that this is the Appleby Magna Carta. But it seems to me very likely that it is.” 

What was “bought for peanuts in 1946” and has sat unceremoniously within the Boston institution will now get its due. Harvard plans to keep its Magna Carta, but now, they know it's worth.

It may be more straightforward than we thought—mathematically speaking, anyway.

Here's what you'll learn in this story.

Two scientists in Finland are claiming to have advanced the cause of a unified theory of gravity, including “a complete, renormalizable theory of quantum gravity.” Physicists have long tried to mesh gravity with the standard model of physics by, in a sense, comparing like with like—how can we describe gravity using measurable things in a way that aligns with how the standard model describes electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces? The key—according to the duo's new research, which appears now in the peer reviewed journal Reports on Progress in Physics—lies in a particular type of theory called a gauge.

A gauge is a way to measure something that is comparable to other things, like India's narrow gauge railways. In physics, gauge theory helps scientists take all the measurable things they know and align them in order to find commonalities or definitions. Using an old English expression, we can define a duck as something that walks like a duck and quacks like a duck. Once something is a proverbial duck, many other properties—like its color, size, or area of origin—can't change its duck-ness. The duck-ness gauge only requires waddling and quacking.

In this paper, physicists Mikko Partanen and Jukka Tulkki turn the universe at large into a bunch of overlapping, finite relationships of symmetry that act as microcosms of the entire standard model. They describe a system with eight dimensions, then break it into pieces that each use four of those dimensions. Finally, they write, “[f]our symmetries of the components of the space-time dimension field are used to derive a gauge theory, called unified gravity.”

Basically, their goal was to find the mathematically smallest model that could still hold up to all the rules required of a theory of unified gravity (one that unites the standard model and quantum physics). This work finds a middle ground between a simplified “toy model” and the complexity of a full model of spacetime. One of the keys is that, within a gauge relationship, many terms can simply be canceled out, the same way you may have learned to do in algebra and calculus.

Partanen and Tulkki claim that by substituting new (but equivalent) values for parts of their formulae,  they've created a gauge model that no longer relies on a contentious variable. “In contrast to previous gauge theories of gravity, all infinities that are encountered in the calculations of loop diagrams can be absorbed by the redefinition of the small number of parameters of the theory in the same way as in the gauge theories of the Standard Model,” they conclude. In other words, gravity may not need to be as complicated as we've made it—at least, mathematically speaking.

A key term in this research is normalization, or renormalization. This is a form of matching reality (and observable qualities within it) to the pure mathematics of a model. Any theory of unified gravity must hold up to how we measure the effects of gravity in our portion of spacetime—or anywhere else in the universe, for that matter.

The scientists chose a compact model over a noncompact one, meaning that their model doesn't have any missing pieces that they aren't sure how to categorize. There's no quacking fish or waddling giraffe gumming up the works of what a duck must be.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Scientists Edited Genes Inside a Living Person for the First Time—and Saved His Life","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a64815804/crispr-therapy/","Tue, 20 May 2025 13:30:00 GMT","

With grim prognosis hanging overhead, doctors and scientists at universities and institutions across the U.S. worked tirelessly to develop the world's first custom gene-editing therapy to save the life of a newborn.

Here's what you'll learn in this story.

Life's ability to successfully copy three billion distinct letters in the human genome is an absolute biological wonder—but sometimes, mistakes are made. Whether inherited or formed in utero, genetic disorders and other birth defects are common, and occur in one in every 33 babies in the U.S., according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For all of human history, a person born with such a disorder likely had to live with the condition, and depending on the defect, those lives could be brutally short. 

But in 2025, human history changed forever. 

In a groundbreaking announcement, detailed in a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, scientists, doctors, and specialists from institutions around the U.S.—including the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of California-Berkeley, and Penn Medicine—successfully saved the life of a newborn patient named KJ, who had been born with a rare genetic disorder. To pull off this incredible medical feat, doctors employed the world's first custom in vivo (i.e. inside a living organism, rather than in a petri dish) CRISPR gene therapy. This technique, developed over decades thanks to U.S.-funded medical research, could help alleviate painful lives for millions of people born every year with now-fixable genetic disorders. 

“Years and years of progress in gene editing and collaboration between researchers and clinicians made this moment possible, and while KJ is just one patient, we hope he is the first of many to benefit from a methodology that can be scaled to fit an individual patient's needs,” Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement.

The details of this incredible medical intervention play out like a made-for-tv medical drama, but the stakes were incredibly real and deadly serious. A week after his birth, doctors noticed something wasn't quite right with KJ. After ruling out a few possibilities, they stumbled across the unfortunate answer—a rare genetic disorder called severe carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency that affects only one in every 1.3 million babies. This disorder inhibits the body's ability to get rid of ammonia, a product of protein metabolism. This can have deadly consequences, impact brain development, and wreak havoc on the liver. Usually, the treatment for a disorder like this is a liver transplant, but that was not an option for the infant boy, who was still too young to be considered for the surgery.

So, once arriving at a diagnosis, Ahrens-Nicklas contacted a gene-editing specialist at the University of Pennsylvania named Kiran Musunuru and “the clock start[ed]in my mind,” he later told The New York Times. Working with a team of specialists across the country for six months, Ahrens-Nicklas and Musunuru developed a targeted gene therapy to fix KJ's specific variant of CPS1. Meanwhile, KJ was kept under medical surveillance at the hospital and subsisted on a diet completely devoid of protein to avoid making his condition worse. By the time the CRISPR treatment was ready, KJ was in the 7th percentile for his weight. 

On February 25, the team began administering the treatment, with Ahrens-Nicklas and Musunuru describing the process as both exciting and terrifying. 

“One of the most terrifying moments was when I walked into the room and said, ‘I don't know if it will work but I promise I will do everything I can to make sure it is safe,'” Ahrens-Nicklas told The New York Times. 

The first infusion took two hours, and within two weeks, KJ began eating protein like a healthy baby. A second dose arrived 22 days later, and about two weeks ago, KJ received a third. Although it's unknown if he will eventually still need a liver transplant, doctors can now safely say that a human life has been saved thanks to the world's first bespoke in vivo gene therapy—a huge testament to decades of a research and experimentation. KJ is now at home with his family.

“We want each and every patient to have the potential to experience the same results we saw in this first patient, and we hope that other academic investigators will replicate this method for many rare diseases and give many patients a fair shot at living a healthy life,” Musunuru said in a press statement. “The promise of gene therapy that we've heard about for decades is coming to fruition, and it's going to utterly transform the way we approach medicine.”

It was the finger seen around the world.

In 2008, archaeologists working in Denisova Cave in southern Siberia, Russia, uncovered a tiny bone: the tip of the little finger of an ancient human that lived there tens of thousands of years ago. 

The fragment didn't seem remarkable, but it was well preserved, giving researchers hope that it harboured intact DNA. A team of geneticists led by Johannes Krause at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, removed 30 milligrams of bone and managed to extract enough intact DNA to analyse it. They were able to sequence the entire mitochondrial genome — and were shocked by what they found. The DNA did not match that of modern humans, or of Neanderthals, the other likely candidate1. It was a new population, which they dubbed the Denisovans, after the cave.

When the team announced this result in March 2010, it caused a sensation. Up to that point, researchers had used preserved bones to identify every species or population of hominin — the group that includes modern and ancient humans and their immediate ancestors. “Denisovans were created from DNA work,” says palaeoanthropologist Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London.

Nine months later came the second bombshell. Krause and his colleagues had obtained the entire nuclear genome from the finger bone, which yielded much more information. It showed that the Denisovans were a sister group to the Neanderthals, which lived in Europe and western Asia for hundreds of thousands of years. The team also described the discovery of a molar tooth, which, on the basis of its mitochondrial DNA, was Denisovan: it was unusually large, unlike teeth from modern humans or Neanderthals.

Even more surprisingly, the team reported that present-day people living on the islands of New Guinea and Bougainville in the southwestern Pacific Ocean have inherited 4–6% of their DNA from Denisovans, despite the fact that these islands are roughly 8,500 kilometres from Denisova Cave. This implied that modern humans interbred with Denisovans, and that Denisovans were once widespread across Asia2. 

That finding triggered a frantic search for the Denisovans. If they had ranged as far as it seemed, where were the fossils? Had palaeoanthropologists not yet found them, or were they sitting unrecognized in museum collections? Researchers went back to the field and explored dusty museum drawers to try to uncover clues about this mysterious group of ancient humans.

Now, 15 years after the first report on this hominin, a handful of fossils have been identified as Denisovan, with varying degrees of certainty. Some are from the lofty heights of the Tibetan plateau; one was hidden in a well for decades; another was dredged from the bottom of the sea. They reveal a diverse, adaptable population that lived in frigid Siberia, at high altitudes and in the tropics — and researchers are scouring Asia for more evidence of them. What they have found so far could force a rethink of the origin of our species.

The story of hominins starts in Africa, where the oldest known species all lived. The earliest one found outside of Africa was Homo erectus, which inhabited what is now Georgia 1.8 million years ago and soon spread as far east as the island of Java in Indonesia3. Later came the Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis), which dispersed throughout Europe and western Asia, sometimes venturing as far as Denisova Cave. At the same time, the Denisovans were living in eastern Asia.

Our own species, Homo sapiens, was the last to evolve, appearing at least 200,000 years ago in Africa (see ‘All in the family'). One fossil find in Morocco suggests that modern humans might date back more than 300,000 years4. H. sapiens left that continent in several waves, eventually replacing all other hominins. But before they did, some of them mated with Neanderthals and Denisovans. Today, the highest levels of Denisovan DNA are found in the Ayta people of the Philippines, but Denisovan DNA is widespread in people from southeast Asia, including Papua New Guinea5.

When researchers set out to find Denisovan fossils, they discovered that one had been collected decades before — and had gone unrecognized.

“The fossil was found without context by a Buddhist monk,” says archaeological scientist Katerina Douka at the University of Vienna. In 1980, the monk had found a lower jawbone in Baishiya Karst Cave on the Tibetan plateau in China. For three decades “it sat in someone's office”, says Douka, until it came to the attention of researchers, including geographer Fahu Chen at the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Beijing. In a 2019 study, Chen and his colleagues extracted and analysed preserved proteins that identified the bone as Denisovan, and dated it to at least 160,000 years ago by measuring radioactive decay in the sediment stuck to the bone's surface6.

The following year, many of the same team reported finding Denisovan DNA preserved in the sediments of Baishiya Karst Cave. This indicated that Denisovans were present there around 100,000 and 60,000 years ago, and that they might have stuck around until 45,000 years ago7. These two studies established that Denisovans lived successfully on the high-altitude Tibetan plateau. This fits with a 2014 genetic study, which found that modern Tibetans have inherited a Denisovan genetic variant that helps them to cope with low oxygen levels, presumably from ancient interbreeding between modern humans and Denisovans in that region8.

In parallel, another dramatic fossil find emerged more than 2,000 kilometres away, in northeast China: it looked like it might be a Denisovan, but the controversy over its classification has rumbled on ever since.

It started in the 1930s, in Harbin, China. An unidentified Chinese man, working for the Japanese forces who occupied that region of China at the time, discovered a hominin skull, recognized its value and hid it down a well. He kept it secret for decades, only revealing its location on his deathbed. His family recovered it in 2018 and donated it to a museum.

A team led by palaeoanthropologist Xijun Ni at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing — and including Stringer — described the Harbin skull in 2021. They found it was at least 146,000 years old. The skull is large, with a cranial capacity comparable with that of modern humans. However, its shape does not match any described hominin species9. In a separate paper, Ni and others described this specimen as belonging to a new species: Homo longi (Dragon Man)10.

Several features of the Harbin skull, notably its big molar teeth, seemed like they might be a match for Denisovans. The same was true of a lone molar tooth found in 2018 at Tam Ngu Hao in the northern mountains of the Lao People's Democratic Republic11. Protein analysis confirmed that the tooth was from a member of the genus Homo, but could not confirm the species. However, its shape resembled the molars from Baishiya Karst Cave, so the discoverers pegged it as a Denisovan. The fossil possibilities were starting to mount up.

Meanwhile, other researchers had been re-examining fossils excavated years earlier, such as a set of skull fragments discovered in the 1970s in Xujiayao, northeast China. Their classification has remained contentious. About ten years ago, anthropologist Christopher Bae at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa saw a photo of a Xujiayao molar side by side with a photo of a molar from Denisova Cave. “They were almost exactly the same,” he says.

One more possible Denisovan sample had turned up in 2008, before the group was even identified. Early that year, a man bought a lower jawbone from an antique shop in Tainan City in Taiwan. It had been dredged from the Penghu Channel, 20 kilometres offshore. The man donated it to a museum after researchers realized, on the basis of photographs, that it was a hominin bone. When they finally described it in 2015, the researchers noted that its second molar looked distinctly Denisovan12. This was supported by a study published this April, in which proteins extracted from the fossil indicated that it belonged to a male Denisovan that lived sometime between 10,000 and 190,000 years ago13 (see ‘On the move').

Source: Ref. 13

In a preprint first published last May, Stringer and his colleagues tried to bring all these disparate fossils together. The problem they faced was vexing: there are a great many unclassified Homo fossils from eastern Asia, and it's not obvious how many groups they represent.

The team analysed 57 hominin fossils, examining up to 521 characteristics of each, depending on how much material was available. This allowed them to reconstruct a family tree showing which fossils belonged to the same groups.

The Eurasian hominins clustered into three groups: modern humans, Neanderthals and H. longi. That third group included the original Denisova remains and the Baishiya Karst Denisovans, as well as the skull fragments from Xujiayao, the specimen dredged from the Penghu Channel and several other Chinese fossils14.

“We would say that the name for Denisovans is going to be longi, if there is a species name,” says Stringer.

Metrics details

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is one of the most promising cancer treatments. However, different hurdles are limiting its application and efficacy. In this context, how aging influences CAR-T cell outcomes is largely unknown. Here we show that CAR-T cells generated from aged female mice present a mitochondrial dysfunction derived from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) depletion that leads to poor stem-like properties and limited functionality in vivo. Moreover, human data analysis revealed that both age and NAD metabolism determine the responsiveness to CAR-T cell therapy. Targeting NAD pathways, we were able to recover the mitochondrial fitness and functionality of CAR-T cells derived from older adults. Altogether, our study demonstrates that aging is a limiting factor to successful CAR-T cell responses. Repairing metabolic and functional obstacles derived from age, such as NAD decline, is a promising strategy to improve current and future CAR-T cell therapies.

Immunotherapeutic strategies based on adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are currently among the most promising approaches to treat cancer. Amongst the features that determine successful responses to CAR-T cell therapy, the long-term maintenance of a T cell pool with stem-like properties is fundamental1,2. As a result, the CAR-T cell field is evolving toward finding strategies that favor the quantity and quality of stem-like T cells in CAR-T infusion products1,2,3. Importantly, this stem-like population engages a particular metabolic program that relies mostly on mitochondrial activity4,5,6,7,8. Indeed, recent studies demonstrated that CAR-T cell products with decreased mitochondrial fitness are associated with poor responses9,10 and metabolic interventions boosting mitochondrial metabolism are able to improve the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy in preclinical models11,12,13,14,15.

A key metabolite that ensures mitochondrial health is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). NAD is a well-known cofactor that has a pivotal role in redox balance and energy metabolism by fueling oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, it serves as a substrate for several enzymes, such as sirtuin deacetylases (SIRTs), that can regulate the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α, a transcription cofactor involved in mitochondrial biogenesis16,17,18. NAD metabolism critically regulates T cell fate and function19,20,21. Thus, alterations in NAD homeostasis have been linked to impaired T cell responses20,22, while restoration of mitochondrial dysfunction through NAD-boosting strategies has been shown to prevent exhaustion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)23.

Aging is the first risk factor associated with cancer. Consequently, the majority (~75%) of persons with cancer and persons eligible for cancer immunotherapy are >65 years old. Importantly, in the context of CAR-T cell therapy, the highest response is observed in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) when the median diagnostic age is <20 years old, while the responses decline with increasing age24. However, whether aging is an important limiting factor for CAR-T cell efficacy and its underlying mechanisms is still unknown. Several investigations have reported that aging leads to deficient immune and metabolic functions that result in altered antitumor responses25. Interestingly, mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of aging26 and NAD decline has been described across several tissues including white adipose tissue (WAT), muscle and liver27,28,29. In our study, we demonstrate that age is a limiting factor for effective CAR-T cell responses. We show that aging drives mitochondrial dysfunction in T cells, which impairs their stem-like properties and antitumor capacities when transduced with a tumor-antigen-directed CAR. We then determine the decline in NAD cellular levels as a major factor responsible for this process and the restauration of NAD homeostasis as a strategy to rejuvenate old CAR-T cells.

To decipher how aging affects the composition of CAR-T cell infusion products, we transduced CD8+ T cells derived from young (8 weeks old) and old (>80 weeks old) mice with a Thy1.1+ CAR construct targeting the human oncogene human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, also known as ERBB2) (refs. 13,14,30). CAR-T cells were then expanded under effector-like (TEM) or memory-like (TCM) polarizing conditions (involving the use of interleukin 2 (IL-2) or IL-7 and IL-15, respectively) (Fig. 1a). Young and old CAR-T cells displayed comparable differentiation capacity when cultured in the presence of IL-2 (Fig. 1b,c). However, old CAR-T cells were unable to properly acquire a memory-like phenotype when cultured with IL-7 and IL-15, as shown by both the lower proportion of TCM cells (Fig. 1b,c) and the decreased levels of the stemness marker T cell factor 1 (TCF1) when compared to younger counterparts (Fig. 1d)31,32,33. To prove that these differences stem not only from the accumulation of experienced (CD44+) T cells with age (Extended Data Fig. 1a) but also from cell-intrinsic defects, we isolated CD8+ naive T cells (CD44−CD62L+) from young and old mice and tested their differentiation capability in vitro. Following initial activation, we expanded under TEM or TCM polarizing conditions and we observed that naive T cells derived from aged mice did not differentiate efficiently toward a TCM phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Accordingly, the TCM population had lower TCF1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 1c). These results suggest that the defective memory-like phenotype identified in aged CAR-T cell infusion products is not only because of differences in the initial population heterogeneity but also because of cell-intrinsic defects of CD8+ T cells.

a, HER2-directed CAR-T cells were generated from CD8+ T cells isolated from spleens of young (8 weeks old) and old (>80 weeks old) mice. On day 3, T cells were further expanded in the presence of IL-2 or IL-7 and IL-15. b, Representative CD44 and CD62L dot plots of young and old CAR-T cells on day 7 upon expansion with IL-2 or IL-7 and IL-15. c, Proportion of CAR-T cells with TEM (CD44+CD62L−) and TCM (CD44+CD62L+) phenotype (n = 3 biologically independent samples). d, Levels of TCF1 within the TCM population of young and old CAR-T cells on day 7 (n = 3 biologically independent samples). e, Killing capacity of young and old CAR-T cells expanded with IL-7 and IL-15 upon coculture with B16-HER2 cells at a 2:1 effector-to-target ratio.

To further assess their functionality, we rechallenged young and old CAR-T cells against HER2-overexpressing B16 melanoma cells in vitro. Aged CAR-T cells exhibited a higher killing capacity than young CAR-T cells (Fig. 1e) and an increased capacity to produce interferon-γ (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (Fig. 1f,g) when compared to young CAR-T cells, thus reflecting the acquisition of a TEM phenotype. Of note, no differences were observed between young and old CAR-T cells when cultured in the presence of IL-2 (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). Despite providing enhanced cytotoxicity, TEM cells exhibit limited proliferative and self-renewing capacities and are more prone to develop an exhausted phenotype. Indeed, old CAR-T cells under chronic stimulation in vitro had lower IFNγ and TNF production (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g), with no differences in the expression of exhaustion markers such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM3), lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3) or thymocyte selection-associated high-mobility group box protein (TOX) (Extended Data Fig. 1h–l). Altogether, these results indicate that age greatly influences the composition of CAR-T cell infusion products, favoring the accumulation of TEM cells with higher cytotoxic properties but limited functions upon multiple rechallenges.

To determine whether aging would be a limiting factor for CAR-T cell efficacy, we next challenged the HER2-directed CAR-T cells in vivo (Fig. 2a). Specifically, we adoptively transferred young and old CAR-T cells (CD45.1+) into mice (CD45.2+) bearing HER2+ B16 tumors. We observed that only CAR-T cells derived from young mice and expanded with IL-7 and IL-15 but not those derived from aged mice could control tumor growth (Fig. 2b,c). No differences were observed between young and old CAR-T cells when expanded in IL-2 (Extended Data Fig. 1m). Young CAR-T cells are able to persist long-term in vivo, generating a pool of CD44+CD62L+TCF1+ CAR-T cells in the spleen that can potentially generate tumor-specific TEM cells that can migrate to the tumor microenvironment (TME). Strikingly, the numbers of transferred (CD45.1+) and CAR-expressing (Thy1.1+) aged T cells were nearly undetectable 30 days after ACT in the spleen (Fig. 2d–f). Aged CAR-T cells completely lacked a memory or stem phenotype, as shown by the absence of CD44+CD62L+ (Fig. 2g) or TCF1+ T cells (Fig. 2h), underscoring their poor ability to persist in vivo, consistent with their TEM commitment. Interestingly, aged CAR-T cells partially improved their persistence when transferred into older hosts, suggesting that age-dependent changes in the microenvironment can also influence CAR-T persistence (Extended Data Fig. 1n; gating strategy in Extended Data Fig. 2).

The development and maintenance of stem-like properties relies on the T cell capacity to boost mitochondrial metabolism5,34,35. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been extensively studied as a hallmark of aging26,36 but whether mitochondrial defects are the main driver of the loss of stemness in aged CD8+ T cells has not yet been elucidated.

To this end, we first compared the mitochondrial profile of freshly isolated CD8+ T cells derived from the spleens of young and aged mice by examining mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial mass by staining with tetramethylrhodamine (TMRM) and MitoTracker green, respectively. CD8+ T cells presented an age-dependent drop in both mitochondrial membrane potential and mass (Fig. 3a,b). Moreover, old CD8+ T cells accumulated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Overall, these data suggest the acquisition of mitochondrial dysfunction in aged T cells, as previously reported23,37,38,39,40,41. Accordingly, old CD8+ T cells displayed a reduced basal and maximal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) upon T cell receptor stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). To demonstrate that these mitochondrial deficiencies were cell-intrinsic defects induced by aging, we proved that mitochondrial activity was dampened in all T cell populations (naive T cell (TN), TEM and TCM) (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Similarly, naive CD8+ T cells also presented an age-dependent progressive decrease in mitochondrial activity without altering mitochondrial size (Extended Data Fig. 3f–h). Electron microscopy (EM) confirmed these findings, as no differences were detected in the number or size of mitochondria (Fig. 3c,d) but aged naive CD8+ T cells had a reduced number of cristae (Fig. 3c,e), a feature of mitochondria with reduced activity.

a, TMRM and MitoTracker green staining in freshly isolated bulk CD8+ T cells from the spleens of young and old mice. TMRM is a cell-permeable dye that accumulates in active mitochondria with intact membrane potential, while MitoTracker green binds to mitochondrial proteins giving a readout of mitochondrial activity and size, respectively (n = 5 biologically independent samples). b, Representative TMRM and MitoTracker green dot plots of data summarized in a. c, EM images of young and old naive CD8+ T cells.

Cells were treated with the NAD-booster NR (1 mM) and levels of the transcription factor TOX were determined on day 12 (n = 3 biologically independent samples). Data are presented as the mean values ± s.e.m. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t-test (a,d,e), two-way ANOVA (g) or paired t-test (h), as appropriate.

To identify age-specific mechanisms driving mitochondrial dysfunction and CAR-T cell failure, we performed liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) to analyze the metabolome of CD8+ T cells derived from young and old mice. Interestingly, aged CD8+ T cells had higher abundance for 15 metabolites, mostly related to purine and pyrimidine synthesis, such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP) riboside, adenosine monophosphate or guanosine monophosphate (Fig. 3f), and lower abundance for 11 metabolites when compared to young CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Table 1). Amongst the low-abundance metabolites, the levels of NAD were the most reduced (Fig. 3f). We and others have shown that supplementation with NAD precursors can increase NAD cellular levels and ameliorate mitochondrial function42. To this end, we treated aged and young T cells with the NAD precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and analyzed their mitochondrial activity. Interestingly, we found that, while NMN was able to improve the mitochondrial activity of young T cells, T cells derived from aged mice were irresponsive to NMN treatment (Fig. 3g). Similarly, old T cells treated with the NAD precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR), which we previously reported to prevent T cell exhaustion23, were not able to prevent TOX upregulation upon chronic in vitro stimulations, in contrast to younger counterparts (Fig. 3h). Overall, our findings demonstrate that aged CD8+ T cells accumulate important mitochondrial defects associated with NAD decline, which cannot be reversed through the administration of conventional NAD precursors.

An investigation by Camacho-Pereira et al. revealed that one of the main triggering factors of NAD decline in WAT, muscle and liver during aging is the systemic upregulation of CD38 (ref. 27). CD38 is a multifunctional enzyme that degrades NAD and modulates NAD homeostasis in a variety of immune cells43,44. CD38-mediated NAD-degradation leads to the production of substrates (namely, cyclic ADP-ribose and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate) that are subsequently involved in the regulation of Ca2+ signaling and the production of adenosine, an important metabolite with immunosuppressive functions43,44. Moreover, it has been reported that CD38 can also mediate the degradation of NAD precursors, including NMN and NR45. Thus, we tested whether CD38 could impact aged CD8+ T cells function by (1) limiting NAD metabolism and mitochondrial activity and (2) preventing responsiveness to NAD precursors. We investigated how CD38 levels change during T cell aging and we found that CD38 is expressed to a higher level in old CD8+ T cells, in both resting and activated states (Fig. 4a). Importantly, this phenomenon was observed in all CD8+ T cell populations (TN, TEM and TCM) (Extended Data Fig. 4a). To determine whether CD38 is a limiting factor of mitochondrial activity in aged CD8+ T cells, we measured mitochondrial membrane potential in T cell subpopulations with high (CD38hi) and low (CD38low) CD38 expression. Importantly, we found that, in aged CD8+ T cells but not in younger controls, only CD38hi T cells displayed reduced mitochondrial activity (Fig. 4b,c). Moreover, young CD8+ T cells transduced with a CD38-overexpressing construct exhibited a limited generation of TCM cells and decreased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c), recapitulating the features of aged CD8+ T cells. These results suggest that CD38 can modulate the mitochondrial activity and fate decision of CD8+ T cells, creating a link among CD38, aging, mitochondrial fitness and maintenance of T cell stemness.

However, CD38 is not the only enzyme impacting NAD cellular levels in aging. For instance, alterations in NAD synthesis pathways (that is, the salvage or de novo synthesis pathways) or the activation of NAD-consuming enzymes can strongly modulate NAD cellular levels28. In particular, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) have been described as the major NAD-consuming enzymes in the cell29,46, where their activation has often been associated with aging because of the accumulation of age-dependent DNA damage. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon is present in aged CD8+ T cells and can affect NAD levels and mitochondrial metabolism. To this end, we first measured DNA damage by analyzing the phosphorylation levels of γH2AX and found that aged CD8+ T cells exhibited a significant increase (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Moreover, we identified that CD38hi T cells, that is, bearing defective mitochondria (Fig. 4b), accumulated more p-γH2AX than CD38low T cells (Extended Data Fig. 4e). These results suggest that the mitochondrial defects in aged CD8+ T cells derive from a multifactorial process impacting NAD homeostasis.

Next, we aimed to elucidate whether restoration of NAD levels is sufficient to reinstate mitochondrial fitness and functionality of aged CAR-T cells. To this end, we used the small molecule 78c to specifically block the NADase activity of CD38 (ref. 47) and we combined it with NMN supplementation. We observed that, according to the previous data (Fig. 3g,h), NMN alone was not sufficient to increase NAD levels in aged CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4d). However, when combined with the CD38 inhibitor 78c, NAD levels were restored to levels seen in younger controls (Fig. 4d). Consequently, 78c + NMN supplementation during ex vivo expansion of CAR-T cells repaired the mitochondrial function of aged CAR-T cells, as shown by an increased spare respiratory capacity (SRC) and mitochondrial mass (Fig. 4e–g). Importantly, the effects of the 78c + NMN treatment were observed in aged T cells but not in younger controls, suggesting that this combination strategy is particularly beneficial in contexts where CD38 levels are aberrantly high. Furthermore, combining 78c and NMN improved the phenotype of the CAR-T infusion products, as shown by a heightened expression of CD62L within the TCM population (Fig. 4h). Similarly, inhibition of PARP activity using olaparib also rescued the NAD levels and mitochondrial activity of aged CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g).

To assess whether the recovery of the mitochondrial fitness was sufficient to restore CAR-T cell functionality in vivo, we reinfused young and old CAR-T cells with or without 78c + NMN treatment in mice bearing HER2+ B16 tumors. We observed that, whereas the untreated aged CAR-T cells were unable to control tumor growth, aged CAR-T cells supplemented with 78c + NMN efficiently controlled tumor growth in line with young CAR-T cells (Fig. 4i,j). Importantly, treated aged CAR-T cells prolonged their long-term survival in vivo, as shown by a significant increase in the number of CD44+CD62L+TCF1+ CAR-T cells found in spleens 30 days after ACT (Fig. 4k). Supplementing young CAR-T cells with NMN + 78c during the ex vivo expansion did not result in improved tumor growth control (Extended Data Fig. 5a) or increased persistence in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 5b), indicating that NMN + 78c treatment restores CAR-T cell functionality specifically in the context of aging.

Additionally, we modified the HER2 CAR construct to integrate a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for CD38 (hereafter referred as HER2 CAR_shRNA CD38) as a strategy to modulate CD38 enzymatic activity by reducing its expression. Upon transduction, both young and old CD8+ T cells presented a highly significant downregulation of CD38 protein levels (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). HER2 CAR_shRNA CD38 T cells generated from young CD8+ T cells and expanded for 7 days in the presence of IL-7 and IL-15 showed a similar TCM phenotype. Interestingly, downregulation of CD38 levels in old CAR-T cells resulted in a worsened expansion of TCM cells, even when expanded in the presence of NMN (Extended Data Fig. 6c). To assess their functionality, we transferred either old CAR_shRNA CD38 T cells, old CAR_shRNA CD38 T cells expanded with NMN or old control CAR-T cells expanded with NMN + 78c into mice bearing HER2+ B16 tumors. CD38 downregulation led to an increased number of CAR-T cells in the spleens 30 days after ACT (Extended Data Fig. 6d). However, the control CAR-T cells supplemented with NMN + 78c but not old CAR_shRNA CD38 T cells were able to successfully control tumor growth (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). These results underline the importance of specifically targeting the NADase activity of CD38 and suggest that the recovery of CAR-T cell functionality through CD38 is NAD dependent.

To validate our findings in alternative CAR-T cell models, we extended our study using anti-CD19_28z (ref. 48), which targets a different antigen and contains a different costimulatory domain. CD19-directed CAR-T cells were generated from young and old CD8+ T cells (CD45.1+) and were adoptively transferred into mice (CD45.2+) engrafted with EL4 lymphoma cancer cells overexpressing mouse CD19 (mCD19) (Fig. 4l). Tumor control capacity was monitored over time. Similarly to the B16-HER2 model, young CAR-T cells were able to successfully control tumor growth, whereas old CAR-T cells failed (Fig. 4m). Importantly, old CAR-T cells expanded in the presence of NMN and 78c recovered their functionality in vivo, as shown by improved tumor growth control (Fig. 4m). Analysis of the spleens at endpoint (day 17) further revealed an increased number of CD45.1+ T cells, indicating improved persistence (Fig. 4n).

Overall, these data demonstrates that NAD metabolism, which is greatly compromised during aging, is a key determinant of CAR-T cell successful responses. Combined strategies to boost NAD levels, such as NAD precursors together with a CD38 or PARP inhibitor, rejuvenates aged CAR-T cells, ultimately leading to improved therapeutic efficacy.

To assess the influence of aging and NAD metabolism on CAR-T clinical application, we reanalyzed recently published anti-CD19 CAR-T data from 31 participants with large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) (15 responders (R) and 16 nonresponders (NoR))49. Importantly, we found that older participants had inferior responses (Fig. 5a). Moreover, single-cell transcriptomic analysis on baseline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 20 participants with LBCL (10 R and 10 NoR) revealed differences in NAD metabolic signatures of CD8+ T cells from R and NoR participants (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 7a). These differences were also detected in natural killer (NK) cells but not in other immune cells (Extended Data Fig. 7b).

Following our previous analysis on NAD-related pathways, we focused on elucidating how CD38 is involved in CAR-T cell outcomes. We found that CD8+ T cells from NoR participants presented a tendency to express higher Cd38 baseline levels (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 7c). Similarly to the NAD signature, Cd38 levels were also lower in the NK cells of R participants (Extended Data Fig. 7d). In addition, using a transcriptomic atlas (https://tanlab4generegulation.shiyapps.io/Tcell_Atlas/)50 of premanufactured T cells from 71 participants with B-ALL, we found that increased Cd38 baseline levels across several T cell subtypes dampened CAR-T cell persistence upon infusion (Extended Data Fig. 6e), suggesting that CD38 is associated with the stemness potential of CAR-T cells. Previous investigations characterized CD38 as a marker of terminally exhausted T cells in both murine (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g) and human (Extended Data Fig. 7h) settings. Consistently, TILs of NoR participants to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) accumulate CD8+ T cell clusters that present an exhausted signature and higher Cd38 levels51, a phenomenon also observed in CD4+ T cells and myeloid cells (Extended Data Fig. 7i). Our findings, however, add to CD38 a role as a non-exhaustion-related predictive marker of CAR-T cell persistence and efficacy. Of note, other NAD-associated pathways such as DNA damage were also predictive of the response (Extended Data Fig. 7j) suggesting that general NAD signatures in baseline PBMCs could be used to predict CAR-T cell responses.

To test whether NAD metabolism could also be targeted to rejuvenate human CAR-T cells, we first analyzed PBMCs derived from participants with melanoma and found an age-dependent increased expression of CD38 in CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5d) but not in CD4+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 7k). To determine whether CD38 expression was altering mitochondrial activity, we compared TMRM staining in CD38hi and CD38low CD8+ T cells and observed that mitochondrial potential was particularly restricted in those cells expressing higher levels of CD38 (Fig. 5e).

Next, we generated human CD19 CAR-T cells containing a 41BB costimulatory domain using PBMCs derived from young (<30 years old) and old (>65 years old) healthy donors, expanded them in the presence of IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15 and compared their mitochondrial fitness (Fig. 5f). CAR-T cells generated from older donors displayed a significant reduction in SRC (Fig. 5g) and mitochondrial mass (Extended Data Fig. 7l). Remarkably, old CAR-T cells supplemented with 78c and NMN during ex vivo expansion were able to revert their mitochondrial defects and reestablish a mitochondrial profile of young CAR-T cells (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 7l). These results suggest that age-associated metabolic defects in CAR-T cells are also observed in a human setting and can be reverted by modulating NAD levels.

To further investigate the importance of aging and NAD metabolism in a clinical setting, we analyzed PBMCs derived from participants with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. We showed that older participants gradually accumulate C–C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7)lowCD45RAlow T cells while losing CCR7hiCD45RAhi T cells (Extended Data Fig. 8a). To test whether these phenotypic differences could also be observed by the end of the expansion of CAR-T cells, we generated human CAR-T cells using PBMCs from young and old participants with melanoma using the same hCD19_BBz model (Fig. 5h). We analyzed the phenotype of CAR-T cells and indeed observed that old CAR-T cells had a lower proportion of CCR7hiCD45RAhi T cells when compared to younger controls. Treatment with NMN + 78c was able to increase the proportion of this T cell subset (Fig. 5i,j). Similarly to the CAR-T cells generated from healthy donors, CAR-T cells from older participants with melanoma presented an impaired mitochondrial function that was reverted upon expansion with NMN + 78c (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Of note, these differences were also observed in a human CD19 CAR-T cell model containing a CD28 costimulatory domain (Extended Data Fig. 8c–e). Old hCD19_BBz CAR-T cells expanded using only IL-2 did not present metabolic recovery upon NMN + 78c supplementation, while showing an increased proportion of CCR7hiCD45RAhi cells (Extended Data Fig. 8f–h).

Lastly, to investigate whether the metabolic and phenotypic changes translated into recovery of the functionality of human CAR-T cells, we cocultured CAR-T cells with NALM6–GFP and tracked their killing capacity upon multiple rechallenges performed every 2–3 days. We observed few differences in killing capacity between young and old CAR-T cells at early stages (Fig. 5k,l). However, old CAR-T cells lost their tumor killing capacity upon multiple rechallenges, whereas young CAR-T cells were able to maintain it. Importantly, old human CAR-T cells treated with NMN + 78c recovered their functionality, as shown by a prolonged maintenance of killing capacity upon multiple rechallenges (Fig. 5k,l). Overall, these data indicate that age determines the phenotype, functionality and metabolic status of CAR-T cells and manipulating NAD metabolism can be used as a strategy to boost their function.

Altogether, our data demonstrate that the age-dependent NAD decline leads to mitochondrial defects and loss of stem-like properties in T cells, ultimately resulting in CAR-T cell failure. Moreover, we establish the restoration of NAD cellular levels as a strategy to recover mitochondrial function and rejuvenate CAR-T cells in the context of aging.

Several drivers of aging (for example, genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, chronic inflammation or mitochondrial dysfunction) are also common drivers of tumorigenesis, which make aging the first risk factor associated with cancer incidence52. In this context, the field of immuno-oncology has greatly expanded during the last decade; however, few studies have investigated how aging impacts immunotherapy efficacy. In the context of ICB, data acquired from preclinical models and clinical trials are currently unclear and contradictory53. In mice, some studies have shown decreased response to anti-PD1 or anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 therapy in aged mice54,55, while other studies have documented an intact or even superior response to PD1 and its ligands56. These discrepancies might be explained by the fact that the expression of PD1 and its ligands is altered during aging in a cell-specific and organ-specific manner and aging affects mutagenesis burden in the tumor, thus influencing T cell infiltration in the TME57. Overall, in ICB, there are several factors independent of the intrinsic effect of aging on T cells that can determine the response to therapy. Indeed, although it is just beginning to be appreciated24, to date, no evidence supports the notion that aging might be an important limiting factor of CAR-T cell therapy efficacy in the clinic. In this Article, we demonstrated that CAR-T cells generated from aged mice display qualitative defects associated with an inability to maintain stem-like properties. We show that the lack of stem-like properties arises from mitochondrial dysfunction derived from the decline in NAD cellular levels and its recovery is sufficient to rejuvenate the functionality of aged CAR-T cells. Moreover, we provide clinically relevant data showing that NAD metabolic pathways can be both targeted and used as predictive markers of CAR-T cell therapy efficacy.

The role of NAD metabolism in T cell function and antitumor responses has been widely explored. A report from Chatterjee et al. (2018) described a potent antitumor T helper 1 and 17 hybrid cell that was able to maintain effector functions while persisting long-term in vivo21. Interestingly, these cells were dependent on a higher NAD-dependent activity of the histone deacetylase SIRT1 (ref. 21). Other studies have also applied NAD-boosting strategies to prevent T cell exhaustion23 or ameliorate CAR-T cell and TIL therapy20,58, providing promising results in preclinical models. As a result, the use of NAD precursors, such as NR or NMN, is gaining relevance in the field of immunotherapy. However, a limitation of current preclinical studies is the lack of aged mice included within the experimental design, which might lead to real-world discrepancies and difficulties to move from bench to bedside. For example, the administration of NAD precursors as a nutritional supplement has been included in several clinical trials to treat cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases but their efficacy has been limited when applied in older subjects. In our study, we found that the sole administration of NAD precursors is indeed insufficient to improve the fitness of aged cells. These findings emphasize the need to find alternative or complementary strategies to increase NAD cellular levels and benefit from its effects. For CD8+ T cells, we explored the CD38 inhibitor 78c in combination with NAD precursors but we cannot exclude other strategies based on additional mechanisms of NAD homeostasis disturbance (PARP inhibitors in combination with NAD precursors). Nonetheless, not all cell types upregulate CD38 and might benefit from their strategy. Other immune cells, such as macrophages, present decreased activity of quinolinate and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferases during aging, both involved in NAD synthesis pathways, and recovery of their activity reinstates macrophage functionality59,60. These results show the importance of maintaining NAD homeostasis during aging for optimal immune function and suggest a tailored NAD-boosting strategy depending on the cell type and context.

Although we focused on the intrinsic defects of CAR-T cells during aging in this study, important factors to consider are the extrinsic barriers that might impede CAR-T cell efficacy. Aging also fosters an environment marked by the presence of senescent cells and systemic low-grade chronic inflammation, known as ‘inflammaging'. Several investigations have described changes in the composition of the TME with aging, including an accumulation of fibroblasts and immunosuppressive cell subsets associated with a senescence-associated secretory phenotype such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells. However, whether tumor initiation and progression are aggravated during aging is still unclear, as some reports have described faster tumor growth in aged mice while other studies support the opposite. Similarly, it is widely discussed whether senescence might have protumoral or antitumoral roles. Thus, further investigation is required to decipher the importance of an aged environment on the outcome of antitumor and immunotherapy responses.

In conclusion, our study found that aging is an important limiting factor for CAR-T cell therapy. Specifically, aged T cells present reduced NAD cellular levels that are linked to decreased mitochondrial fitness, ultimately preventing the maintenance of stem-like properties of CAR-T cells and leading to deficient long-term survival in vivo and tumor growth control. These findings emphasize the importance of using aged models in the field of cancer immunology, which can uncover mechanisms of CAR-T cell failure that are often overlooked in preclinical studies, shedding light on novel strategies that can ameliorate CAR-T cell therapy.

C57BL/6 CD45.1+ and CD45.1 × CD45.2 young (8 weeks old) and old (80–105 weeks old) female mice were bred and maintained in house. For all in vivo experiments, host C57BL/6 CD45.2+ female mice (8 weeks old) were purchased from EnVigo laboratories (C57BL/6OlaHsd). Donors and recipients of adoptive T cell transfers were sex-matched. Mice were housed at 22 °C with 55% relative humidity on a 12-h light–dark cycle. Mice were fed ad libitum with Safe-150 chow. All animal experiments were performed in the animal facility in Epalinges at the University of Lausanne (UNIL), as approved by the veterinary authorities of the canton of Vaud and performed in accordance with Swiss federal law (VD3572).

B16-HER2-mK2 and Phoenix ECO cells were a kind gift from G. Coukos (UNIL) and were cultured in RPMI 1640-Glutamax medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. EL4-mCD19 cells were a kind gift from M. L. Davila (Moffitt Cancer Center) and were cultured in RPMI 1640-Glutamax medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.

HER2-directed CAR containing a 41BBz costimulatory domain was cloned in the MSGV retroviral transfer vector as described previously13,30. For some experiments, an shRNA for silencing murine Cd38 was cloned in the HER2_41BBz vector. For retrovirus production, Phoenix ECO cells were transfected with HER2 CAR plasmid and pCL-Eco-packaging plasmid using TurboFect transfection reagent (LifeTechnologies) in OptiMEM medium (Thermo Fisher). After 48 h and 72 h, supernatants were recovered and virus was collected by ultracentrifugation (Beckman Avanti J-26). Spleens from wild-type CD45.1 or CD45.1 × CD45.2 mice were smashed through a 70-μm cell strainer. CD8+ T cells were purified using the EasySep mouse CD8+ T cell isolation kit (StemCell), according to the manufacturer's instructions. CD8+ T cells were plated at a concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells per ml and activated with Activator CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher) at a 2:1 bead-to-cell ratio in the presence of recombinant murine IL-2 (10 IU per ml; PeproTech). T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640-Glutamax medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 5 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco) and sodium pyruvate (Gibco). T cells were transduced 24 h and 48 h after activation using 48-well plates precoated with RetroNectin (20 μg ml−1; Takara). After overnight coating at 4 °C, 48-well plates were blocked for 30 min with 2% BSA in PBS, followed by a PBS wash before adding the concentrated retroviruses. Retroviruses were centrifuged for 90 min at 2,000 rcf and 32 °C. Then, T cells were added on top of the viruses and centrifuged for 10 min at 300 rcf and 25 °C. On day 3, activation beads were removed and T cells were expanded using either mouse IL-2 or human IL-7 and IL-15 (10 ng ml−1; Miltenyi Biotec). T cell media and cytokines were replaced on day 5 and transduction efficacy was assessed on day 7. Metabolic and phenotype analyses, as well as ACT for in vivo experiments, were always performed on day 7 unless otherwise stated in the figure legend. Where stated, CAR-T cells were treated with NMN (1 mM; Sigma Aldrich), 78c (200 nM; Sigma Aldrich) and/or olaparib (5 μM; Lubio Science) on days 3 and 5 after activation.

TCF1 (clone C63D9, 2203S, Cell Signaling, 1/200) was stained with an unconjugated antibody. An additional staining was performed with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG (4412S, Cell Signaling, 1:250). The following conjugated antibodies were used for human experiments: CD3–BV711 (clone UCHT1, 300464, Biolegend, 1/200), CD4–BV605 (clone OKT4, 317438, Biolegend, 1/200), CD8–APC (clone SK1, 344722, Biolegend, 1/200), CCR7–BV421 (clone G043H7, 353208, Biolegend, 1/100), CD45RA–PE TexasRed (clone MEM-56, MHCD45RA17, Thermo Fisher, 1/50), CD62L–PercP Cy5.5 (clone DREG-56, 304824, Biolegend, 1/200) and CD38–AF700 (clone HIT2, 303524, Biolegend, 1/200).

For assessment of intracellular markers, cells were fixed and permeabilized using FoxP3 fixation and permeabilization buffer (00-5523-00, eBioscience). For live–dead discrimination, live/dead Aqua or live/dead NIR kits were used (L34957 and L10119, LifeTechnologies). To assess mitochondrial activity and mitochondrial size, cells were stained with TMRM (T668; 25 nM) and MitoTracker Green (M7514; 100 nM) for 30 min at 37 °C. For cytokine staining, T cells were restimulated using anti-CD3ε-coated plates for 4 h in the presence of brefeldin A (420601, BioLegend, 1/1,000). For pH2AX staining, cells were stained upon fixation and permeabilization using the PECy7-conjugated anti-H2A.X (S139) antibody for 1 h at 4 °C (613420, Biolegend). The samples were acquired using the CytoFLEX S (Beckman Coulter), CytoFLEX LX (Beckman Coulter) or Aurora (Cytek Biosciences). Data analysis was performed using FlowJo (version 10.9.0).

For the HER2_41BBz-B16 model, B16-HER2 (105) cells were subcutaneously injected on the right flank of 8-week-old C57BL/6 CD45.2+ mice. After 9 days, mice were exposed to sublethal irradiation (5 Gy) followed by one round of intravenous CAR-T cell transfer (2–3 × 106 cells per mouse) performed on day 10. Before the transfer, mice were randomized to have comparative tumor volumes. For the mCD19_28z-EL4 model, EL4-mCD19 cells (5 × 105) cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of 8-week-old C57BL/6 CD45.2+ mice. After 6 days, mice were exposed to sublethal irradiation (5 Gy) followed by one round of intravenous CAR-T cell transfer (3 × 106 cells per mouse) performed on day 7. Before the transfer, mice were randomized to have comparative tumor volumes. Mice were monitored three times a week and tumor length (L; greatest longitudinal measurement) and width (W; greatest transverse measurement) were measured with a caliper. Tumor volumes (V) were calculated using the formula: V = (L × W2)/2. Mice were killed at endpoint by CO2 and, where indicated, tumors, spleens and lymph nodes were collected. As permitted by the Swiss federal law, a maximal tumor size of 1,000 m3 was reached. In some cases, this limit was exceeded on the last day of measurement and the mice were immediately killed. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications23,61. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiment.

Murine CD38 complementary DNA was synthesized and flanked with the restriction enzymes Not1 and SalI, which were cloned into a retroviral MSCV vector containing a Thy1.1 promoter. The construction of the CD38 OE vector was performed by GenScript Biotech. The sequence can be found in Supplementary Table 2.

Young and old naive CD8+ T cells were sorted using the EasySep mouse naive CD8+ T cell isolation kit (StemCell). For the analysis, EM was performed as described previously62. Sorted cells were fixed in their culture medium with glutaraldehyde (EM Sciences) at a final concentration of 2.5% in phosphate buffer (0.1 M PB pH 7.4; Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature (RT). As noted previously, they were directly postfixed by a fresh mixture of glutaraldehyde 2.5%, osmium tetroxide 1% (EM Sciences) and potassium ferrocyanide 1.5% (Sigma) in PB for 1 h at RT. The samples were then washed three times in distilled water and spun down in low-melting-point agarose 2% in H2O (Sigma), left to solidify on ice, cut into 1-mm3 cubes and dehydrated in acetone solution (Sigma) at graded concentrations (30%, 40 min; 50%, 40 min; 70%, 40 min; 100%, 1 h twice). This was followed by infiltration in Epon (Sigma) at graded concentrations (Epon 1:3 acetone, 2 h; Epon 3:1 acetone, 2 h; Epon 1, 1–4 h; Epon 1, 1–12 h) and finally polymerized for 48 h at 60 °C in oven. Ultrathin sections of 50 nm were cut on a Leica Ultracut (Leica Mikrosysteme) and picked up on a copper slot grid (2 × 1 mm; EM Sciences) coated with a PEI film (Sigma). Sections were poststained with uranyl acetate 2% (Sigma) in H2O for 10 min, rinsed several times with H2O followed by Reynolds lead citrate in H2O (Sigma) for 10 min and rinsed several times with H2O. Micrographs were recorded with a transmission EM instrument (Philips CM100, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a TemCam-F416 digital camera (TVIPS). Image analysis and quantification were carried out using ImageJ software (version 2.16.0). The number of mitochondria per cell was quantified. For assessing mitochondrial cristae, each dot represents the crista number in one mitochondrion from one high-magnitude EM image of a live cell.

OCRs were determined using a Seahorse Bioanalyzer XFe96. Briefly, CD8+ T cells were resuspended in Seahorse XF basic medium supplemented with 10 mM glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM glutamine (pH 7.4, at 37 °C). CD8+ T cells were plated in a Cell-Tak-coated (22.4 μg ml−1) Seahorse XFe96 microplate (2 × 105 cells per well). The injection ports were loaded with 1 μM oligomycin, 2 μM carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) and 0.5 μM rotenone–antimycin. During sensor calibration, cells were incubated in a 37 °C non-CO2 incubator for 45 min. Data were analyzed using Seahorse Wave (version 2.4.3).

To determine the killing capacity of murine CAR-T cells, the IncuCyte ZOOM system was used. Specifically, 104 B16-HER2 cells containing the red fluorescent protein mK2 were plated in flat-bottom 96-well plates. After 4 h of incubation, young or old CAR-T cells expanded with IL-2 or IL-7 and IL-15 were added on top at a 2:1 effector-to-target ratio. Upon coculture, plates were placed immediately in the IncuCyte ZOOM system for 3 days. Killing capacity was determined by quantifying the red area and normalizing to negative controls (that is, B16-HER2 mK2 cells cultured in the absence of CAR-T cells). To evaluate the killing capacity of human CAR-T cells upon multiple rechallenges, 103 NALM6–GFP cells were seeded in a flat-bottom 96-well plate and CAR-T cells were added at an effector-to-target ratio of 1:4. Subsequently, 105 NALM6–GFP cells were added every 2–3 days for repeated tumor challenges. The cytotoxic activity of CAR-T cells was monitored over 23 days by measuring the GFP signal density (objects per mm²) using the IncuCyte ZOOM system.

The intracellular level of different metabolites was determined by performing LC–MS/MS analysis. For metabolite extraction, cell lysates were extracted by the addition of methanol and H2O (4:1), followed by homogenization with ceramic beads in the Cryolys Precellys 24 sample homogenizer. Homogenized extracts were then centrifuged for 15 min at 4,000g and 4 °C and the resulting supernatant was collected and evaporated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator. Dried extracts were resuspended in methanol and H2O before LC–MS/MS analysis. Raw LC–MS/MS data were processed using the Agilent Quantitative analysis software. Raw data can be found in Supplementary Table 1.

For NAD and reduced NAD (NADH) quantification, the NAD/NADH quantitation kit (SigmaAldrich) was used. For each sample, 1 × 106 cells per sample were collected and the manufacturer's instructions were followed.

DNA was isolated using the DNeasy kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the mtDNA-tonDNA ratio, qPCR was performed using Power SYBR green master mix (Thermo Fisher) and analyzed on the 7900HT system (Applied Biosystems) to estimate the relative values for mtDNA (COX1) and nDNA (NDUFV1).

CD8+ T cells were isolated and activated using plates coated with Ultra-LEAF anti-mouse CD3e (3 μg ml−1, Biolegend) and soluble Ultra-LEAF anti-mouse CD28 (1.5 μg ml−1, Biolegend). After 3 days, cells were washed and expanded for 4 days in the presence of IL-7 and IL-15. On days 7, 9 and 11, CD8 T cells were restimulated using CD3-coated plates. Fresh medium and IL-7 and IL-15 were added to the wells at the time of restimulation. Where indicated, cells were treated with NR (1 mM) on days 7, 9 and 11. Phenotypic and functional readouts were performed on day 12.

Human blood samples were obtained from healthy young donors (aged 25–28 years) and elderly donors (aged 66–70 years). To generate CAR-T cells, CD3+ T cells were negatively isolated using the RosetteSep human T cell enrichment cocktail (StemCell, 15061). T cells were treated with ACK lysis buffer (Gibco, A10492-01) and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, 21875158) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, 11360-070) and 10 mM HEPES (Gibco, 15630-056). For stimulation, T cells were cultured with CD3/CD28-activating Dynabeads (Gibco, 11132D) at a 1:1 bead-to-cell ratio. The following day, T cells were transduced with the hCD19_41BBz (FMC63 scFv) or hCD19_CD28z lentiviral vector at a multiplicity of infection of 4. Recombinant human IL-2 (Proleukin, Roche) or a cytokine combination of IL-2, IL-7 (Peprotech, 200-07) and IL-15 (Peprotech, 200-15) was added every other day to a final concentration of 30 IU per ml and 10 ng ml−1, respectively. Cells were counted and fed every 2 days until day 10, after which they were cryopreserved. All T cell functional assays were conducted in media without cytokines. For the generation of CAR-T cells from participants with melanoma, 2 × 105 frozen PBMCs from young (aged 40–44 years) and elderly (aged 79–84 years) donors were seeded in a round-bottom 96-well plate and processed as described above.

Donations from healthy volunteers were approved by the Comission Cantonale d'Ethique de la Recherche Genève (CCER). Samples from participants with cancer were taken from a biobank supported by the study protocol CCER 2016-01237. Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals.

An scRNA-seq dataset of human baseline PBMCs from 20 participants with LBCL was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE197268). Metadata on age and response to therapy were obtained from the supplementary material of the associated publication49. To exclude low-quality cells and outliers, the following quality control filters were applied on the scRNA-seq data: percentage of mitochondrial genes < 25%, number of detected genes = 300–5,000, number of UMIs = 500–20,000 and log10 genes per UMI > 0.6. Raw counts were normalized using a standard log1p normalization implemented in Seurat (version 5.0.1)63. Broad cell types for each scRNA-seq sample were predicted using the scGate tool and its default PBMC model64. CD8 T cell subtypes were annotated using ProjecTILs65 and a published reference map of human CD8 T cell subtypes66. Gene signatures for NAD metabolism and DNA repair were downloaded from MSigDB67 under the ‘Gene Ontology biological process' subset. On the basis of these gene sets, signature scores were calculated using the UCell method with default parameters68. Statistical comparisons (Wilcoxon test) were performed at the sample level by averaging signature scores for each participant and cell type. To assess the expression of CD38 in the context of markers of stemness and exhaustion, we interrogated two multistudy reference maps of murine65 and human66 tumor-infiltrating T cells. For each T cell subtype, we calculated the normalized average expression of CD38, HAVCR2, TOX and TCF7.

All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 10.0.3. The sample size (n) is stated in each figure legend together with the statistical test adopted. Data are shown as the mean ± s.e.m. P values < 0.05 were considered significant. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. All statistical tests used were two-sided.

Metrics details

Far-red (FR) light elicits two distinct processes in plants. First, a shade avoidance response which is triggered when the ratio of red to FR (R: FR) declines. Second, it interacts synergistically with higher frequency wavelengths of light (e.g. red or white) which improves the efficiency of photosynthesis. We investigated whether we could harness these phenomena in medicinal Cannabis to improve yields so that the duration of the photoperiod could be reduced to 10 h (“10L”) whilst returning similar or improved yields compared to a 12 h photoperiod (“12L”). The THC concentrations were elevated in both high THC varieties by the different FR treatments. In Hindu Kush the concentration of THC was elevated by the addition of 4 h of total FR (“10L_2_2D”), and in Northern Lights total cannabinoid yields were increased by nearly 70% over the 12 L control (0.43 versus 0.25 g Plant− 1) by the addition of 2 h of FR in darkness after 10 h of light (“10L_2D”). Our results show a strong yield and quality advantage in high THC lines treated with end-of-day FR treatments. Furthermore, a lighting schedule of 10L_2D instead of 12 L would result in a saving of 5.5% in power usage and resultant emissions.

Cannabis Sativa is a globally significant plant species with a wide range of uses, including the production of fibre for clothing, seeds for animal and human nutrition and compounds with psychoactive properties for medicinal, religious, and recreational purposes. Currently, the primary target cannabinoids in medicinal cannabis are tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA)1. Through decarboxylation, which converts the acid forms into their neutral forms, THCA becomes Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (“d9-THC”), and CBDA becomes cannabidiol (CBD). These neutral forms have the ability to interact with the mammalian endocannabinoid system, offering therapeutic benefits for non-communicable illnesses such as sleep disorders, multiple sclerosis, appetite stimulation, and epilepsy2,3,4.

Growing medicinal cannabis indoors and in a glasshouse offer advantages such as climate control and security and precise control over environmental factors such as light, temperature, humidity and CO2 levels, allowing growers to create optimal growth conditions for year-round production of maximised yields5. Moreover, indoor cultivation provides protection from external abiotic and biotic stresses such as climate, pests and diseases, resulting in more consistent and reliable product quality5,6. Light emitting diode (LED) lighting is the preferred choice for indoor cultivation due to its energy efficiency, customisable light spectrum, and low heat output6. LEDs can be adjusted to match specific growth stages, promoting healthier plants and maximising yields.

Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into carbon-based matter, is influenced by the overall light quality7,8. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), which ranges from 400 nm to 700 nm and far-red (FR) light wavelengths in the range of 700 nm to 800 nm play a crucial role in plant photosynthetic capacity and crop yields7.

Far-red light has been a subject of interest for various plant industries, including medical Cannabis (MC). Plants have evolved to sense FR and react to it as a means to respond to intra and interspecific competition for light. The most recognised response of plants to FR light is the shade avoidance response9,10. When plants are shaded by neighbouring vegetation, the chlorophylls of the rival plants selectively absorb the red and blue wavelengths, whilst reflecting or transmitting the FR. This causes a decrease in the red light to far red (R: FR) ratio which triggers a range of responses, including stem elongation, leaf expansion, and altered flowering patterns which are part of shade avoidance mechanisms11. The response to FR light is mediated by phytochromes, photoreceptors that sense different wavelengths of light12. The change in proportions of R: FR cause a concurrent shift in the proportions of the active phytochrome form, Pfr, to the inactive form, Pr13. The inactive forms prevent the breakdown of a group of transcription factors called PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs), instead allowing them to relocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. There, they initiate the responses frequently associated with shade avoidance, by activating genes involved in auxin biosynthesis and cell elongation14.

In experiments using monochromatic light, photosynthesis rapidly declines as the wavelength of light increases towards the FR end of the spectrum; this was described as the “red drop” by Emerson and Lewis in 194315. However, when monochromatic FR light was supplemented with lower wavelength red light, an interaction was observed that resulted in a photosynthetic rate that was greater than when either spectrum was applied alone. This synergistic effect was termed the Emerson effect16. In more recent years a series of studies8,17,18,19,20 have also shown that a synergistic effect occurs when certain spectra such as red-blue or warm white, are supplemented with FR18,20. The explanation for this phenomenon lies in the fact that photosystems I and II, which operate in series for the electron transport chain, need to be excited approximately equally for optimal photosynthetic efficiency21 and this is not always the case, especially under artificial lighting. Zhen and van Iersal (2017)20 demonstrated that the chlorophyll fluorescence declined (a measure of greater efficiency of electron transfer from PSII to PSI) following the application of FR under a red/blue spectrum, and the authors concluded that this was a result of FR preferentially exciting PSI allowing more rapid re-oxidation of plastoquinone22,23. The re-oxidised plastoquinone can then accept more electrons from PSII chlorophylls allowing the PSII reaction centres to re-open more quickly, thus improving the rate and efficiency of photosynthesis20,23. Thus, their work showed that far-red light can increase the photosynthetic efficiency of shorter wavelength light that over-excites PSII.

Therefore, the addition of FR light radiation in the spectrum can both modify plant morphology through shade avoidance and enhance the efficiency of photosynthesis. Understanding and harnessing the effects of FR light could have significant implications for optimising medical cannabis cultivation and improving crop quality.

Previous experiments conducted in various crops have demonstrated multiple outcomes when applying FR light that could be beneficial in Cannabis production systems. For example, in Glycine max (soybean) it was observed that under a low R: FR ratio, there was an increase in photo-assimilate content, indicating enhanced photosynthetic activity, and a rise in sucrose and starch content, suggesting potential metabolic shifts9. The addition of FR light to the light spectrum has been documented to hasten the flowering process across various plant species, such as lentil24. It is important to note, however, that lentil is a long-day flowering plant. In short-day flowering plants, recent experimentation has demonstrated that the addition of FR light during a 12-hour period of darkness significantly delayed the onset flowering in Cannabis and Glycine max (Soybean)9. These results highlight the significant impact that the R: FR ratio can have on plant development and metabolic processes in various crop species.

Flowering in most varieties of Cannabis is strongly regulated by photoperiod. In the Cannabis industry, an inductive flowering photoperiod of 12 h light: 12 h dark (12 L:12D) is enforced by black-out curtains and supplementary lighting. It has previously been shown that extending the flowering photoperiod from 12 h light to 14 h light was detrimental to the cannabinoid contents in the high THC varieties, Hindu Kush and Northern Lights, whereas reducing the photoperiod to 10 h caused a flower biomass decrease reducing the yield25. Therefore, in these two lines the industry standard 12 L:12D was optimal for production. However, if the addition of FR light could increase the rate of photosynthesis and/or initiate metabolic shifts, a shorter photoperiod could potentially be employed which would result in lower energy costs and carbon emissions. This is an enticing prospect as the economic cost of lighting in Cannabis cultivation constitutes a significant portion of overall operational expenses. It estimated to require Australian growers 4kWh of energy to produce 1 g of dried flower per m226, therefore, indoor cultivation using 100% LED lighting for 12 or 18 + hours a day (for flowering or mother generation, respectively) results in considerable electricity costs. High CO2 emissions go hand-in-hand with high electricity usage and recent modelling from the US reported that 1,283-5,184 kg CO2 e per kg of dried flower was emitted from indoor grow facilities, with 238–805 kg CO2 e of that value being derived from grow lights5.

This study investigated whether hours of full-spectrum light could be substituted by increased exposure to FR. To determine this, we tested the effects of supplementary FR, either at the end of the light period, the start of the dark period, or both, on plant height, flowering, biomass yield and cannabinoid contents under either a control (12 L) or shortened photoperiod (10 L).

Under natural conditions as the sun sets, the amount of far red light exceeds the amount of red light27 and previous studies in other species have shown stronger responses to FR treatments applied at the end of day rather than earlier timepoints. For these reasons, we chose to apply the FR treatments at the end of the photoperiod in our indoor system.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether the addition of end-of-day FR could supplement for 2 h of full spectrum light. The 6 treatments used to test this were:

10 L = 10 h photoperiod, no FR.

10L_2 = 2 h of FR in the last 2 h of the light period (hours 8–10).

10L_2D = 2 h of FR applied at the start of the dark period (hours 10–12).

10L_2_2D = 4 h of FR applied as 2 h in the light and 2 h at the start of the dark (hours 8–12).

12 L = the control 12 h photoperiod (no FR).

12L_2_2D = 4 h of FR applied as 2 h in the light and 2 h at the start of the dark (hours 10–14).

Plant height was increased by the application of FR in all genotypes as all 10 L treatments with FR were significantly taller than 10 L (no FR) (Fig. 1). The 12 L (no FR) treatment resulted in significantly shorter plants compared to the 10L_2_2D and the 12L_2_2D treatment resulted in significantly taller plants than all other treatments.

Final plant height. N = 7. Results of an ANOVA and Tukey HSD are shown (P = < 0.05). Treatment abbreviations 10 L 10 h photoperiod, no FR, 10L_2 2 h of FR in the last 2 h of the light period, 10L_2D 2 h of FR applied at the start of the dark period, 10L_2_2D 4 h of FR applied as 2 h in the light and 2 h at the start of the dark, 12 L 12 h photoperiod (no FR), 12L_2_2D 4 h of FR applied as 2 h in the light and 2 h at the start of the dark.

Whole plant fresh weight (FW) biomass was significantly increased in Cannatonic and Hindu Kush in the 12L_2_2D treatment compared to the control (12 L), wheras no significant differences between treatments were observed for Northern Lights (Fig. 2). In Hindu Kush, the 10 L treatment also resulted in a significantly lower whole plant biomass compared to all treatments, except 10L_2_2D.

Plant biomass (g FW). N = 7. Results of an ANOVA are shown with a Tukey HSD test (P = < 0.05), NSD = no significant differences. Treatment abbreviations 10 L 10 h photoperiod, no FR, 10L_2 = 2 hours of FR in the last 2 h of the light period, 10L_2D 2 h of FR applied at the start of the dark period, 10L_2_2D 4 h of FR applied as 2 h in the light and 2 h at the start of the dark, 12 L 12 h photoperiod (no FR), 12L_2_2D 4 h of FR applied as 2 h in the light and 2 h at the start of the dark.

The trimmed flower weight was significantly reduced by the 12_2_2D treatment in all genotypes, whereas the leaf and stem (vegetative) biomass showed the opposite effect, being increased by the 12L_2_2D treatment in all genotypes.

The leaf + stem FW biomass of Hindu Kush was significantly reduced in 10 L compared to all other treatments.

The cannabinoid data for 12L_2_2D was not quantified as the plants did not produce enough dry flower biomass yield for cannabinoid analysis.

Seventeen cannabinoids were analysed28 but five were either not dectected in any sample (CBN, Δ8-THC, CBLA, CBL) or detected in some, but below the threshold for quantification (CBNA). Different cannabinoids were detected in the three genotypes. In Cannatonic, eight cannabinoids were detected, whereas in the high THCA accumulating lines, Hindu Kush and Northern Lights, six Cannabinoids were detected, respectively (Fig. 3).

Cannabinoid concentrations µg g DW. N = 4 +/-SE. The results of an ANOVA and Tukey HSD test are shown (P = < 0.05), NSD = No significant difference. Treatment abbreviations 10 L 10 h photoperiod, no FR, 10L_2 2 h of FR in the last 2 h of the light period, 10L_2D 2 h of FR applied at the start of the dark period, 10L_2_2D 4 h of FR applied as 2 h in the light and 2 h at the start of the dark, 12 L 12 h photoperiod (no FR).

In Cannatonic, seven out of the eight quantified cannabinoids showed significant differences in concentration in response to treatment (Fig. 3). The neutral cannabinoids, CBDV, CBD and d9-THC all showed a similar response where the abundance was highest equally in 10L_2_2D and 12 L and lower in the other 10 L treatments. The 10L_2D treatment resulted in a higher concentration of CBD than either 10 L or 10L_2 and produced a low but detectable level of CBDV, where as 10 L and 10L_2, did not. The concentration of THCA and CBGA was significantly higher in 10 L compared to all other treatments. For the highest abundant cannabinoid in Cannatonic, CBDA, the treatments containing FR all appeared to repress accumulation.

The same cannabiniods were detected in both Hindu Kush and Northern Lights but THCV was below the level of quantification in Hindu Kush (Fig. 3). Differences in response to treatment were observed between these two high THC lines. In Hindu Kush, the acidic cannabinoids CBGA, THCVA and THCA were equally high in 10L_2_2D and 12 L but lower in the other treatments, and CBDA was highest in 10 L but lower in all other treatments. In Northern Lights, significant differences in response to treatment were only observed in d9-THC and THCA. The concentration of d9-THC was significantly higher in 10L_2D, 10L_2_2D and 12 L compared to the 10 L and 10L_2 treatments. THCA was significantly elevated by ~ 25% in the 10L_2D treatment compared to either 10–12 L. THCV was only observed in the 10L_2D, 10L_2_2D and 12 L treatments, it was also observed in 10L_2 but only in a single sample (Fig. 3). No significant differences in the concentration of THCVA was observed for Northern Lights, but the concentrations trended higher in 10L_2D and 10L_2_2D compared to the other treatments.

No significant differences were observed between treatments for dry flower yields (g Plant-1) for any of the genotypes (Fig. 4). In contrast, all lines showed a response to treatment in the target cannabinoid % (total CBD or THC – see Materials and Methods for formula). In Cannatonic, treatments with 10L_2 or 10L_2D both showed depressed concentrations of total CBD compared to 10 L and 12 L. In Hindu Kush the total THC% in 12 L and 10L_2_2D were elevated compared to the other treatments whereas in Northern Lights the highest concentration was in the 10L_2D treatment (Fig. 4). No significant differences in total cannabinoid yield (g Plant-1) were observed in Cannatonic or Hindu Kush despite the observed differences in target cannabinoid % (Fig. 4). However, in Northern Lights, the combined effect of increased THC% in 10L_2D and the slightly raised (though non-significant) increase in flower biomass in the same treatment resulted in an increase of 70% (0.43 g Plant-1) of yield compared to 10 L (0.27 g Plant-1) or 12 L (0.25 g Plant-1) (Fig. 4).

Effect of treatment on total cannabinoid yield (CBD – Cannatonic, THC – Hindu Kush and Northern Lights). N = 4, +/-SE. Results of an ANOVA and Tukey HSD test are shown. In ANOVA values marked with and asterisks*, a LSD test was used in place of Tukey P = < 0.05. NSD = No Significant Difference. Treatment abbreviations 10 L 10 h photoperiod, no FR, 10L_2 2 h of FR in the last 2 h of the light period, 10L_2D 2 h of FR applied at the start of the dark period, 10L_2_2D 4 h of FR applied as 2 h in the light and 2 h at the start of the dark, 12 L 12 h photoperiod (no FR).

The energy use, associated costs and projected carbon emissions from the five lighting treatments that resulted in a commercially viable flower yield are shown in Table 1. The different lighting settings resulted in different power demands. The lowest was 10 L and the highest being 12 L. If a grower was to use the 10L_2D treatment that resulted in the 70% yield advantage in Northern Lights, a 5.5% saving on electricity and emissions would be made compared to using the standard 12 L (Table 1). These values reflect only the lighting energy use and not electricity use for the whole facility (which includes, for example, temperature control).

All three genotypes showed increased plant height in the treatments that received FR with the tallest plants being observed in 10L_2_2D and 12L_2_2D, most likely because these treatments had the longest daily duration of reduced R: FR ratio (4 h) and therefore induced a stronger shade response. This observation is consistent with findings reported in multiple other species that the addition of FR increases plant height7,30,31. It is known that the response of plants to shading is strongest when the shift in R: FR is sensed at dusk10. This finding was discovered in Arabidopsis in which the effect on hypocotyl elongation was observed following application of 2 h of a low R: FR at different times of day. When the treatment was received at dusk, hypocotyl elongation increased 25–30%, whereas receiving the signal earlier had a reduced response and at dawn even caused a small but significant decrease in elongation compared to controls10. In a further study, shading was applied in 2 h blocks in the lead up to dusk (e.g. hours 6–8, 7–9, 8–10). The authors found that there was no change in response compared to unshaded plants when shade was applied at hours 6–8, but there was doubling in response if shade was applied an hour later at 7–9 (the end of the photoperiod was at hour 10)32. If the response described in Arabidopsis is similar for Cannabis, this means that applying the FR treatments at the end of the day as done in this study (i.e. dusk) would have had the strongest promotion of stem elongation. Our results further indicate that the magnitude of response can be manipulated via exposure time. Arabidopsis is a long-day flowering plant and flowering is accelerated by a low R: FR ratio. As with the hypocotyl response, flowering under low R: FR is also regulated by the PHYB phytochrome signalling pathway33. In mutants of PHYB, the diurnal transcriptional expression of flowering locus T (FT), is strongly upregulated and consequently flowering occurs two-weeks earlier than wild-type33. Whether the flowering response, like the hypocotyl, is also responsive to FR treatments applied at different times of day is unknown, but as the governing regulatory pathways are similar it seems reasonable to assume. We have previously shown that in Hindu Kush, Northern Lights and Cannatonic, flower yields were optimised in a 12–14 L, but reduced in 10 L25. These pieces of evidence offer an explanation as to why such an extreme delay in flowering and increase in height was observed in the 12L_2_2D compared to the same treatment 2 h earlier at 10L_2_2D; the response to shading could be more exacerbated in the last hours of the optimum photoperiod for reproductive growth (10–14 h), rather than earlier in the photoperiod (8–12 h).

In Cannatonic and Hindu Kush, an increase in whole plant biomass was observed under 12_2_2D compared to 12 L. This shows that the inclusion of FR can further promote biomass accumulation for some varieties, despite not directly contributing to photoassimilation. The effect was strongest in plants grown under 12_2_2D, possibly due to changes in biomass partitioning towards vegetative matter rather than flowers. In citrus trees, flowering has been shown to be the growth stage with the highest consumption of photoassimilates34, demonstrating that more energy is required to produce the same mass of flowers as vegetative biomass. Therefore, the application of FR repressed flowering and allowed repartitioning of reserves into vegetative mass. However, for Hindu Kush, this explanation is not adequate as no reduction in flower biomass was observed with the increase in vegetative growth in any of the 10 L FR treatments compared to 10 L. In this case, it appears that the addition of 2 h of FR promoted vegetative growth and maintained reproductive growth. This may have occurred via the phenomenon reported in a series of papers by Zhen et al.8,17,18,19,20 in which the balance of excitation between PSI and PSII is improved by the addition of FR into the light spectrum, leading to improved efficiency of photosynthesis. The phenomenon was evident when either sunlight or red/blue LED light was supplied to lettuce plants and then supplemented with 18 narrow bands of FR light to observe the change in the quantum yield of PSII (ΦPSII)19. The ΦPSII was elevated at all spectrums tested compared to ΦPSII without the addition of the FR19. Thus, an improvement in photosynthetic efficiency offers an explanation for the increase in biomass in Hindu Kush when the red/blue/white LED spectrum used for this study was supplemented with FR. However, it is clearly a genotype-specific phenomenon that is not detectable, at least under the treatments we provided, in Cannatonic and Northern Lights.

In Hindu Kush grown at 10 L, we observed increases in the acidic cannabinoid concentrations (except CBDA) in response to 4 h of FR, but smaller, or no change in response to only 2 h (either before or after onset of dark period). This suggests that a dose response exists and that 2 h was inadequate to initiate a change in cannabinoids. Conversely, in Northern Lights the strongest positive effect on THC was observed when FR was applied only in the dark (10L_2D). As application in the dark resulted in a R: FR ratio of 0, because there was only FR, this could suggest that an increase in THCA in Northern Lights only occurs under an extremely low R: FR ratio. An effect of FR on cannabinoids has been previously reported in which the high THC genotype “G-170” was observed to have reduced THC concentrations in a treatment with the lowest R: FR ratio (high pressure sodium)31. The authors concluded that this could be either because of the low R: FR ratio, or the absence of blue light in this spectrum31. As our plants were not deprived of blue light, our results suggest that a very low R: FR is actually beneficial for THCA accumulation, with the absence of blue light likely causing the detrimental effect observed in the previous study31.

In terms of the total cannabinoid yield (g plant− 1), Northern Lights responded differently to the FR treatments compared to Hindu Kush and Cannatonic. In Northern Lights, the application of 2 h of FR in the dark after 10 L resulted in an increase in total THC yield (g Plant-1), compared to the control 12 L treatment. This was mainly due to a significant increase in total THC % plant-1, rather than an increase in biomass yield, which was not significant. This is of interest for growers producing a dried flower, inhalable, product as this treatment produced a crop of higher THC concentration flowers, with two hours less full-spectrum light.

From a crop management perspective our results have several important implications. Many growers are shifting to vertical farming systems which require a set plant height and distance away from the LEDs. Having a high ratio, or excluding FR, will result in more compact plants. In order to not disrupt flowering and maturity, supplementing with FR light needs to be carefully considered, as our findings demonstrate that 12L_2_2D delayed flowering and demolished flower biomass yield. There are numerous studies that have shown flowering acceleration in response to FR application e.g. tomato35, petunia and snapdragon36. However, these examples are all long-day flowering plants, whereas in short-day flowering, our results and previous reports37, suggests that extended application (e.g. 12L_2_2D) of FR it is more likely to delay flowering, which is not desirable for growers. However, lesser amounts of FR application (2 h) in a 10 L photoperiod showed no detrimental effect on flowering. Our study did not address differences in response to varying ratios of R: FR (only duration at a set ratio of 0.43). In a recent study into the effect of full-spectrum light intensity, Cannabis plants were exposed to a linear gradient of intensity which allowed for response curves to be plotted38. A similar experiment using FR would be beneficial to allow for the optimum ratio(s) to be identified which could then improve treatment efficiency. There is also scope to optimise the application of a far-red treatment from the overhead lighting used in our system to an intra-canopy lighting system. The use of intra-canopy lighting to partially replace overhead light has been shown to improve yields in some glasshouse crops, at least in part through reduced reflectance39,40. If the efficiency of the light application could be improved, this could further reduce energy usage and the respective carbon footprint.

To return to the original question posed in the introduction: can the addition of FR in a 10 h photoperiod substitute for extra hours in full spectrum light? The biggest yield increase was in Northern Lights in 10L_2D, in which the yield was 70% higher compared to the control 12 L. However, as this observation was variety specific, with no changes in cannabinoid yields in Cannatonic and Hindu Kush, a grower would first have to test the effect of this treatment on their specific varieties.

These findings have significant implications for the cannabis industry, specifically for energy consumption, with electricity being a significant cost for cultivation. Consequently, the preference is to achieve productivity improvements without extending, and ideally reducing, the duration of the artificial lighting period. If growers were to utilize a 10L_2D treatment instead of 12 L, a saving of 5.5% would be made on power and carbon emissions. In a report by PharmOut Pty Ltd26, it was reported that for a hypothetical Australian indoor facility, 4000–6000 kWh of electricity was required per kg of dried flower produced, and 38% of electricity was used on lighting. If we assume an intermediate value of 5500 kWh /kg, 38% = 2090 kWh /kg. A reduction of 5.5% would equate to a saving of 115 kWh. In NSW, electricity is charged at approximately $0.338 kWh41 therefore this would equate to a saving of $39 / kg dried flower and assuming a CO2 emission rate of 0.79 kg CO2 e/ kWh29 a saving of 91 kg CO2 e/ kg would be made.

The application of end of day FR can increase the cannabinoid concentration in high THC varieties of medicinal Cannabis. There was no effect of our FR treatments on flower biomass yields. The cannabinoid responses to FR treatments differed between genotypes and a 4 h dose in combination with a 12 h photoperiod was detrimental for yield in all tested. This evidence shows that, where far red is concerned, you can have too much of a good thing. The increase in Cannabinoid % when FR is applied in a shortened photoperiod allows for the same yields to be produced with a lower energy and carbon footprint.

Three medicinal cannabis genotypes provided by Cann Group Ltd (https://www.canngrouplimited.com/, accessed on 22/03/2024) were employed in this study. These genotypes included one high CBDA strain, “Cannatonic,” and two high THCA strains, “Hindu Kush” and “Northern Lights” (previously referred to as “CBD1,” “THC6,” and “THC1,” respectively)42. These genotypes had also been previously used in the same growth system in our study on photoperiod responses25. These lines were initially chosen because they were all popular medicinal cannabis cultivars but phenotypically and genetically distinct, thus provided information directly relevant to the industry while also providing an indication of the genotype-specificity of observed responses.

All plants were cultivated in a secure facility approved by the Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care Office of Drug Control (ODC). The experiments were carried out under a Commonwealth license and associated permits. Temperature and humidity were maintained at 25 °C and 50%, respectively. The plants were grown in controlled environments (CE) throughout their life cycle, and they were moved within the CEs on a weekly basis during the flowering period to account for any environmental variations.

The cloning and propagation method used has been previously documented42. Experimental plants were cloned from donor mothers. Approximately 15 cm of new growth stems were excised from the mother plants. All leaves on the stem sides were removed, leaving only the top leaf bunch. The bottom of the stem was cut diagonally across a node, creating a clone approximately 12 cm in height. The top leaf bunch was trimmed to the height of the smallest emerging leaf to reduce water loss and prevent overlapping in the propagation dome. The bottom 1 cm of the stem, where roots would form, was lightly scraped with a scalpel, dipped in hormone gel (Clonex Purple, Yates, DuluxGroup, Clayton, Australia), and placed in an organic propagation cube (Eazyplug CT12, Goirle, The Netherlands, eazyplug.nl).

Once the propagation tray was filled with new clones, it was positioned in a propagation dome (Smart Garden heavy-duty 3-piece propagation kit, Epping Hydroponics) for 14 days. The clones were subjected to an 18-hour light/6-hour dark (18 L:6D) photoperiod in a growth cabinet (Conviron A2000, Conviron Asia Pacific Pty Ltd, Grovedale, Australia) at a light intensity of 100 µmol m² s⁻¹ and a temperature of 25 °C. Humidity was gradually reduced over the 14-day propagation period. Plants with established roots were then transplanted into 1.8-litre pots containing a 30:70% blend of perlite and coco-coir with an electrical conductivity (EC) of < 0.5 mS/cm (Professors Nutrients, Australia). Subsequently, the plants were transferred to controlled flowering environments under a photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 600 µmol m² s⁻¹ (Heliospectre Grow Light, LX602C) and maintained under an 18 L:6D photoperiod for an additional 5 days as a hardening period to acclimate to the new environment. After the additional 5 days, the photoperiod was switched to one of the 6 treatments described below and flowering was initiated. The temperature ranged from 20 oC (night) to 26 °C (day), and blackout curtains prevented light leakage. The plants were watered and fed using a commercial fertigation recipe with an electrical conductivity (EC) of 2.2 mS/cm and a pH of 6. As there was an odd number of plants (21) within each treatment, plants were spaced 10 cm apart in 40 × 50 cm grid with an extra plant on the end of the row. As plants were kept small (see Peterswald et al. 2023), this setup assured that plants did not shade each other. To avoid edge effects plant positions were shifted in the chambers twice per week during watering.

Each treatment contained 7 replicates of each of the 3 genotypes in a fully randomised design. The six zones were programmed to one of each of the following photoperiods with different timing applications of FR as presented in Table 2. All plants were maintained in these treatments for 40 days, which was the day after cloning (DAC) 70, which is the end point of the flowering treatments.

The 6 programmed zones were controlled using Heliospectre Software (heliospectra.com). A description of each six light spectrum treatments is described in Table 3. The light intensity drops for all treatments from hour 8 because the maximum power (µMol m2 S-1) of the red light band (660 nm) is more powerful than the maximum of the FR band (735 nm) therefore, in order to achieve a low ratio, the FR had to be turned up and the red band down. Treatments not receiving FR in the light period were treated the same to ensure that the daily PAR was consistent between treatments. The height of the plants from the lights was not periodically adjusted because our experiments were designed to represent conditions in commercial facilities in which the bench height and lighting infrastructures are typically fixed. The temperature within the treatments at canopy height was 26 oC under the full spectrum lights and 24 oC under FR only and 20 oC with all lights off.

Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and the PAR of blue (460 nm), red (660 nm) and white (5700 K) light was measured using a LightScout Quantum Meter and Far Red (735 nm) was measured using a LightScout Red/Far Red Meter (spec-meters.com)/ (accessed on October 19, 2023).

Flowering development was assessed on a weekly basis starting from Day After Cloning 37 (DAC 37) to ascertain the presence or absence of pistils (scored as 1/0) and trichomes (scored as 1/0). Plant height was measured weekly, commencing from DAC 30.

The harvest took place on DAC 70. Plants were excised at the base, and then the whole plant was weighed (whole plant FW). The large fan leaves were removed, and the flowers were manually stripped from the stem and trimmed using a mechanical trimmer (TrimPro ROTOR, Canada). The trimmed flowers were re-weighed (trimmed flower fresh weight) and placed into a foil tray. The flowers were dried in a dedicated drying room at 21 °C and 50% humidity until no further reduction in weight was observed (9 days). The samples were then re-weighed, and the total flower dry weight (g plant− 1) was calculated.

The methodology for quantifying cannabinoids has been previously documented28. For each of the 6 treatments and control groups, 4 biological replicates were analyzed for THCA and THC (in the cases of Hindu Kush and Northern Lights) and CBDA and CBD (for Cannatonic), encompassing three different genotypes. Total THC and CBD was then calculated with the following formulae: Total THC = THC + (THCA*0.877) and Total CBD = CBD + (CBDA*0.877).

From each individual plant, three florets were randomly selected from the dried subsample of flower material and finely ground into a powder using liquid nitrogen. A 0.1-gram sub-sample was employed for cannabinoid quantification, which involved sonication in 100% ethanol using a SONICLEAN instrument (Soniclean®, Dudley Park, Australia) operating at 50/60 Hz for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting ethanolic extracts were preserved at -10 °C until needed. Subsequently, these extracts were diluted and subjected to analysis through high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QToFMS, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Separation was achieved using a reversed-phase column (Agilent Infinity Poroshell 120, HPH-C18, 2.1 × 150 mm, 2.7 μm, narrow bore LC column, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with mobile phases consisting of methanol-water-acetonitrile and acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% formic acid (v/v). The analysis was executed using Quant Analysis Software 10.2 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and cannabinoid peaks were identified based on their mass-to-charge (m/z) values and retention times by calibration against cannabinoid standards (Novachem, VIC, Australia).

The total yield of each cannabinoid in g per plant (g plant− 1) was calculated as follows:

((%Cannabinoid/100) x Total flower dry weight in grams) = g cannabinoid plant− 1.

The kWh used by each of the treatments was calculated using an amp meter (Hioki AC Clamp Meter 3280–10 F, Hioki, Singapore), with a resolution of 0.01 A. The lights were LEDs so there was no “ramp up” or down period and so the amperage requirement for a single setting (e.g. 12 L–2 h of FR in the dark) does not change. At a single timepoint, the amp meter was fitted to each light treatment and the current draw (power drawn from the grid) was recorded. Amps were then converted to kW and multiplied by the photoperiod duration (e.g. 12 h at full spectrum + 2 h of far-red). The carbon emissions per kWh for New South Wales (NSW) Australia were sourced from The Australian Greenhouse Accounts Factors 202229.

All graphics and statistical analyses were performed in R 3.143. One way ANOVA's were performed per variety and Tukey HSD tests were used to identify pair-wise differences between treatments significance for all tests was set at ≤ 0.05. In circumstances were the ANOVA returned a significant statistic but the Tukey HSD test could not identify difference at the ≤ 0.05, a Least Significant Differences (LSD) test was performed using the agricolae package in R43,44.

Metrics details

Enzymatic depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) towards monomer recycling offers a green route to a circular plastic economy, with scale-up currently underway. Yet, inconsistent assessment methods hinder clear comparisons between various PET hydrolases. This Perspective aims to identify critical gaps in this dynamic research field and outline key principles for selecting and tailoring novel enzymes, such as using uniform PET samples and standardizing reaction settings that mimic industrial conditions. Applying these guidelines will improve enzyme screening efficiency, increase data reproducibility, deepen the understanding of interfacial biocatalysis, and ultimately accelerate the development of more robust and cost-effective bio-based PET recycling methods.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is extensively utilized in beverage bottles, textiles, and food packaging, making it one of the most prevalent plastics in global waste streams. Consequently, its significant contribution to plastic pollution has raised urgent demand for innovative recycling technologies from both scientific and industrial sectors. In many countries, PET, especially single-use bottles, may achieve up to 90% recycling rates, making it the most recycled among all mass-produced fossil-fuel-derived plastics1,2. PET in bottles and food packaging is rarely blended with other polymers and typically lacks or contains only trace amounts of chemical additives3. This high purity and homogeneity of its chemical composition render PET the most broadly studied and preferred target for recycling advancements, encompassing mechanical, chemical, and biological approaches4,5,6.

PET has a polyester backbone, which is notably susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage. Since the 1970s, scientists have been inspired to investigate the broad variety of natural ester hydrolases for their potential in depolymerizing synthetic polyesters, including PET. In 2005, Müller et al. reported the first widely recognized enzymatic depolymerization of amorphized waste PET bottles7. The last two decades have witnessed the identification, characterization, and engineering of numerous PET hydrolases6,8, as well as the successful demonstration of biological recycling of waste PET on an industrial scale9. This achievement has been recognized as one of the ten emerging chemical technologies in 2023 by IUPAC10.

Recent techno-economic analysis (TEA)11 and life cycle assessment (LCA)12 have indicated that although PET bio-recycling holds promise, substantial challenges persist regarding energy consumption, economic feasibility, and overall environmental impact, particularly due to mechanical processing required to amorphize waste PET and pH regulation during the depolymerization reaction. While innovations addressing these process-related bottlenecks are infrequently reported in recent scientific literature13, an increasing number of reports claiming superior enzymes based on limited experimental evidence have emerged. Moreover, redundant studies often appear that merely replicate findings derived from a set of thoroughly examined benchmark enzymes, particularly informed by two seminal studies: the 2016 Science article by Yoshida et al., which identified IsPETase from Ideonella sakaiensis14, and the 2020 Nature publication by Tournier et al., which described several engineered variants of the leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC) allowing for rapid PET waste depolymerization on an industrial scale9. By contrast, although researchers in recent years have discovered numerous novel PET hydrolases from diverse habitats with potentially distinct characteristics, most are abandoned after initial publications. Another unfavorable scenario in this research domain is that many studies used polymer substrates from unknown origins or performed plastic depolymerization under conditions unrelated to industrial settings. Consequently, it is imperative to standardize and disclose a full array of these essential parameters in future research to prevent overoptimistic assessments of performance, erroneous data interpretations and the formulation of non-reproducible or invalid hypotheses, in alignment with previous expert viewpoints5,11,12. A recent publication by Arnal et al.15 has experimentally highlighted this issue by providing a reliable assessment of four important PET hydrolases under industry-mimicking recycling conditions. Following the identification of significant inconsistencies in depolymerization performance compared to the original studies, the necessity of establishing standards for future enzyme activity evaluations and enabling cross-study comparisons is increasingly evident.

This Perspective aims to provide a brief overview of the historical context and current advancements in this research area, focusing on methodologies for the discovery, screening, and characterization of novel PET hydrolases, as well as assessing their viability for industrial-scale plastic recycling, to complement recent expert reviews with a broader scope6,8,16,17. For the former research objective, we intend to emphasize research gaps in method selection and further development concerning potential final applications of PET hydrolases with distinct features. To achieve the latter research goal of developing more effective industrial biocatalysts for plastic recycling, we recommend prioritizing the use of standardized substrates that are most similar to industrial waste PET feedstocks, as well as selecting reaction conditions that resemble industrial environments in lab-scale or pilot-scale reactor experiments. We anticipate the emergence of an improved multi-pronged future research, including (i) the advancement of scientific understanding of interfacial biocatalysis and enzymatic depolymerization mechanisms, (ii) the validation of screening assays that can be readily implemented in most laboratories without the need for specialized equipment, and (iii) the design of novel PET hydrolases that are less related to a limited number of thoroughly investigated benchmark enzymes.

Early efforts to discover polyester hydrolases strongly relied on classical microbiological techniques, including the isolation, cultivation, and enrichment of microbial strains capable of hydrolyzing natural polyesters. This led to the identification of fungal and bacterial cutinases, such as those from Fusarium18 and Thermobifida species19, which were later proven to depolymerize synthetic polyesters like PET7,20. Despite over half a century of research advancements, this method remains valuable for identifying novel plastic-degrading strains and enzymes from plastic-contaminated environments. These include the thoroughly studied PET-metabolizing bacterium I. sakaiensis, which secretes the mesophilic IsPETase14, and likewise other microorganisms with similar characteristics isolated from marine sediments21 or wastewater22.

Metagenomics has emerged as an efficient approach to identifying novel PET hydrolases since 2012. The earliest and most extensively studied example is LCC, identified from a plant compost metagenome using a fosmid library and functional screening against tributyrin, an esterase model substrate23. However, functional metagenomics has contributed minimally to further significant PET hydrolase discoveries. Instead, most recent PET hydrolases have been identified through sequence-based enzyme mining, regardless of whether metagenomic DNA was physically extracted24,25 or sourced from online databases26,27,28,29. These sequence-based methods have become central, with gene sources extending to annotated yet uncharacterized sequences found in public repositories like NCBI and UniProt16,29,30,31. However, these bioinformatics-based searches have often been biased by employing established enzymes such as LCC, IsPETase, and those from Thermobifida species as templates, limiting exploration to a narrow phylogeny and sequence space27. Interestingly, despite their sequence similarities, many of these newly discovered PET hydrolases were found to stem from geographically and ecologically distinct habitats, including extreme environments such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents28, glaciers32, and even human saliva metagenomes33, calling into question the hypothesis that PET hydrolases evolved naturally in response to environmental plastic pollution, which has only been present for less than 70 years. It is not surprising that many natural carboxylesterases, found in nearly all organisms, are anticipated to exhibit at least minimal hydrolytic activity on the ester bonds in PET.

The restricted structural diversity of reported PET hydrolases, attributable to their close phylogenetic relationships, creates an “echo chamber” effect that overrepresents structure-based mechanistic studies toward particular benchmark enzymes. This is evident in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), where out of more than 130 PET hydrolase-associated structures, over one-third represent IsPETase and its variants. Similar redundancy is seen with other benchmark enzymes9,24,34,35,36, with numerous nearly identical apo structures deposited. Instead, co-structures complexed with substrates or analogues may yield significant insights for semi-rational and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven enzyme engineering; nonetheless, they are limited, with less than 16% of PET hydrolase structures in the PDB solved in a substrate (analogue)-bound state16. This highlights the ongoing challenge of obtaining wet-lab data on substrate interactions, essential for advancing functional studies and developing more efficient PET hydrolases.

According to the ESTHER database on α/β-hydrolase fold proteins37, most PET hydrolases with known structures belong to the polyesterase-lipase-cutinase (PLC) family sourced from bacteria27,29. These enzymes can be further classified into three types (I, IIa, IIb) based on amino acid adoption at specific surface subsites38. Type I includes thermophilic enzymes like LCC23 and those from Thermobifida species20, while Type IIa is represented by the polyester hydrolase (PE-H) from Pseudomonas aestusnigri39 and Type IIb by IsPETase14. Figure 1 shows that, despite their classification, these enzymes have a highly conserved core fold with only minor variations from the structure of LCC, such as an extra α-helical turn due to additional residues. Archaeal PET hydrolase from the feruloyl esterase family has key structural similarities with bacterial PLC-family PET hydrolases, but with additional α-helices flanking the active site40. This partially covered active site, similar to certain lipase family polyester hydrolases41, is expected to limit its access to polymeric substrates. Eliminating these lid-like structures has demonstrated an improvement in PET hydrolyzing ability41. Fungal cutinase-like PET hydrolases possess the most unique structures compared to LCC, with the lowest root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value42. Although fungal cutinases were among the first recognized effective PET hydrolases43, they remained largely neglected in this research domain until recently when several studies with significant polymer degradation performance were published44,45. PET hydrolases with alternative structural folds and distinct active site geometries but considerably low depolymerizing activity were recently discovered using bioinformatics and machine-learning-guided enzyme mining in multiple metagenomic libraries27. This study validated the hypothesis that high depolymerization efficiency is likely confined to bacterial PLC-like and fungal cutinase-like PET hydrolases. A more recent study significantly expanded the range of target PET hydrolase sequences by incorporating various blocks from the ESTHER database, although it remains confined to enzymes with an α/β-hydrolase fold. Landscape profiling by sampling a sequence cluster framework revealed a collection of highly active enzymes, including MiPa-P and KuBu-P, the latter of which can even catalyze PET glycolysis in the presence of highly concentrated ethylene glycol (EG)29. Still, the top-performing enzymes, KuBu-P (PDB code 8YTW) and MiPa-P (PDB code 8YTU), have relatively low RMSD values of 0.94 Å and 0.98 Å to LCC, respectively. These findings are complicating the potential for further engineering of distinct scaffolds for industrial applications.

Illustrated are selected bacterial polyesterase-lipase-cutinase (PLC)-like27,34,36,136 and fungal cutinase-like PET hydrolases42,137,138, alongside phylogenetically distinct enzymes from archaea40 and bacteria27,139  with minimal depolymerization activity but structural uniqueness. These PET hydrolases are grouped based on their Cα root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) relative to LCC as a reference. Ribbon plots are colored with a gradient from low RMSD (blue) to 4 Å and higher (white). The catalytic triad (serine, histidine, and asparagine in all structures) is shown as yellow sticks. PDB codes, RMSD values, and residues included in the calculations are shown below each structure.

Alternatively, emerging AI-driven techniques, such as de novo enzyme design46, have the potential to generate unique PET hydrolases. In a recent study47, novel, mostly α-helical hydrolase scaffolds were obtained using a diffusion model coupled with an ensemble generation method focused on the active site preorganization. Interestingly, new active serine hydrolase scaffolds have been generated, even specifically designed to catalyze PET hydrolysis. However, disclosing only kinetic data against an atypical small-molecule substrate is insufficient to assess its realistic PET depolymerization activity. Another study generated a terminally truncated PET hydrolase using LCC as a template, with a similar catalytic efficiency but markedly lower stability than its parental scaffold46. The next option for creating novel PET hydrolases is to incorporate the classical hydrolase catalytic triad into structurally stable, non-catalytic proteins48. Nonetheless, the resulting PET depolymerization activity is significantly constrained by the inherent protein architecture, which may hinder effective substrate access necessary for interfacial catalysis17,49. Although these studies demonstrated the feasibility of the computational methodology, it is yet to be determined whether AI-assisted design can generate novel PET hydrolase scaffolds with overwhelming activity that surpasses the naturally evolved α/β hydrolase folds.

PET is a semi-crystalline thermoplastic composed of crystalline fractions with well-ordered, tightly packed polymer chains and surrounding amorphous fractions with randomly oriented, intertwined molecules50. The crystalline microstructures exhibit significant resistance to the diffusion of water and enzymes, which are essential reactants and catalysts for biocatalytic depolymerization, respectively8,51. In contrast, the amorphous PET fractions are significantly more susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly when environmental temperatures reach or exceed the glass transition temperature (Tg). Shorter segments of amorphous PET undergo conformational changes during the glass transition, which is thought to improve enzyme accessibility and subsequent ester bond hydrolysis significantly8,50,52. The Tg of PET under anhydrous conditions has been determined to range between 65 and 81 °C, depending on the analytical methods used8,53. PET substrates are completely immersed in water during biocatalytic depolymerization, and the resulting water plasticization effect can lower the bulk Tg of PET by up to 16 °C8,53. Considering the enhanced mobility of surface-located polymer chains54, the Tg of the PET surface layer (surface Tg) may be as low as ~40 °C53, which explains why significant hydrolysis of highly amorphous PET can be observed with mesophilic bacteria like I. sakaiensis under ambient conditions14.

Melt-extrusion-based amorphization9,15,36,55,56,57,58,59 is commonly used as the first step before enzymatic PET decomposition due to the high crystallinity of over 30% in real-world waste PET streams (Fig. 2). Rapidly quenching the hot polymer extrudates in cold water or other solvents is required to achieve a low-crystallinity of ideally less than 15%, allowing for rapid biocatalytic depolymerization50,60,61. Thereafter, the amorphized PET typically undergoes a mechanical size-reduction process, either via cryogenic grinding or ambient temperature crushing9,15,36,57,58,59. The increased surface-to-volume ratios are considered advantageous for interfacial enzyme accessibility, thereby improving polymer conversion efficiency. Nevertheless, this hypothesis has not consistently held true in several recent studies. The smallest particles with the highest specific surface area (SSA) extracted from the same micronization batch of low-crystallinity (or amorphized) PET typically exhibited slightly or moderately enhanced initial hydrolysis rates, particularly at lower enzyme loading, but significantly reduced maximum achievable depolymerization extent compared to the larger ones with lower SSA55,62,63. The latter phenomenon has been ascribed to the increased crystallinity, which typically exhibits an inverse relationship with particle sizes, caused by strain-induced crystallization during micronization36,55,62,64. Larger ground particles and precursor amorphous PET materials prior to micronization (either granules from melt-quenching or commercial PET films) can be enzymatically depolymerized to comparably high extents after an adequate reaction duration. Given the high energy costs and negative environmental effects associated with the micronization process11,12, the trade-offs between fast hydrolysis kinetics using cryomilled plastics and prolonged depolymerization with non-ground plastics necessitate reassessment in industrial settings. A patent for PET pre-treatment aimed at enzymatic recycling suggests that using an underwater pelletizer (Fig. 2) to produce small pellets under 1 mm could replace the contentious and energy-intensive grinding process65.

To improve its economic viability, the cryogrinding step is considered optional and omitted here. The figure also displays key material-related parameters and reaction conditions that affect depolymerization performance. The crystallinity, molecular mass, and specific surface area of a particular PET sample are crucial interrelated parameters that influence the achievable degree of depolymerization. A simplified schematic surface plot illustrating the threshold values for optimal depolymerization performance emphasizes the interdependence of these parameters. Additional parameters influencing decomposition performance, such as varying Tg of the surface layer and interior bulk polymers, as well as the effect of water plasticization and polymer recrystallization under biocatalytic conditions, should be considered. Bioreactor parameters for reaction conditions must be consistently documented and standardized to ensure comparable high-level depolymerization results.

Polymer chain scission can occur at each stage of the presently performed thermomechanical pre-treatment of PET waste (Fig. 2). Despite being an undesirable consequence when a similar melt-extrusion process is used for PET mechanical recycling66, the decreased molecular weights were found to facilitate the subsequent enzymatic depolymerization36,67. Once PET feedstocks have a number-averaged molecular mass (Mn) of less than 10,000 g mol−1, their rapid and complete enzymatic depolymerization becomes less dependent on the bulk crystallinity, even if it surpasses the previously recommended degradable threshold value of 20%57. By harsher pre-treatment involving microwaves, PET's Mn can be reduced below the entanglement length of 3500 g mol−1 and readily hydrolyzed using an IsPETase variant at ambient temperature67. Within this Mn range, conventional indicators of high crystalline PET, such as the increased ratio of trans to gauche conformation, become irrelevant for describing its enzymatic degradability.

These findings highlight the importance of comprehensively documenting all of these polymer properties, including molecular mass, SSA (or particle size), and bulk crystallinity (preferably also the crystallinity of the surface polymer layer), throughout the depolymerization process in future research. This can assist in unambiguously defining standard PET feedstocks (Table 1) and building a standardized amorphization technique that balances optimal material qualities related to degradability and economic viability, reducing the cost of this most expensive step11,12. Currently, research groups lacking comprehensive polymer characterization equipment are advised to utilize commercially available amorphous PET film, such as that provided by Goodfellow Ltd., as a preliminary test material for PET hydrolases in initial laboratory-scale scientific studies. Several studies36,68 have recently published detailed polymer parameters for this material, ranging beyond mere crystallinity, establishing its optimal utility over waste PET from unknown sources with undefined properties.

The distinct polymer properties of PET also define the appropriate characteristics of the biocatalysts and the reaction conditions necessary for its fast depolymerization (Table 1). The flexibility of water-plasticized amorphous PET polymer chains enhances as reaction temperatures rise between 40-70 °C, facilitating their accessibility to enzymatic hydrolysis69. Higher temperatures, however, lead to faster polymer recrystallization into non-degradable crystalline microstructures than enzymatic depolymerization can occur9,15,50,60. Consequently, recent studies indicate a preference for reaction temperatures between 65 and 70 °C and the use of thermotolerant enzymes, such as LCC-ICCG9,15, TurboPETase57 and PES-H115,24,36,61,70,71, in pilot-scale processes that resemble industrial settings9,57,71. Accordingly, thermostabilization has been implemented as a primary strategy to enhance the depolymerization capability of mesophilic PET hydrolases, including Kubu-P29 and IsPETase14. Nonetheless, regarding IsPETase, despite substantial research having raised its melting point (Tm) by over 37 °C72,73,74, the most advanced variants remain inferior to LCC-ICCG in large-scale PET depolymerization tests15. This raises the question of whether a high Tm (above 85 °C) can serve as the sole criterion, as commonly employed in previous studies6,8, to determine if a specific enzyme inherently exhibits the necessary long-term stability and activity over several hours for the rapid PET decomposition at elevated temperatures. Instead, future research should evaluate the kinetic stability of an enzyme under operational conditions to provide a broader assessment of its thermostability.

The continuous release of terephthalate (TPA) monomer as a result of enzymatic PET hydrolysis lowers the pH value of the reaction supernatant, which may influence enzyme activity and stability, as well as the compositions of the product mixture15,75. Increased concentrations of unwanted oligomeric ester intermediates can hinder subsequent product purification and diminish the yield of pure TPA. Therefore, recently demonstrated depolymerization processes are frequently pH-controlled in the range of 7–8, which is appropriate for most known PET hydrolases9,43,57. Nonetheless, low-concentrated phosphate or Tris buffers are commonly used in lab-scale bioreactors with pH control9,57. This should be avoided in large industrial settings to reduce costs and ensure reactor durability. pH control is considered a concern regarding the economic and environmental impacts of industrial PET recycling12. For future lab-scale studies, these impacts can be mitigated by utilizing ammonia in place of NaOH for pH regulation12,58 or implementing small-scale bioreactors (<50 mL), such as the modified Chi.Bio systems instead of other larger commercial bioreactors76. Nonetheless, because small reactors can only accommodate less than 10% solid loading, it is recommended to validate the process in medium-sized reactors (in litre scales) that allow standard agitation with up to 30% solid loading before final industrial implementation at cubic meter scale (Box 1). A more ambitious long-term vision to address this pH-related issue may involve designing a PET hydrolase that is less sensitive to pH fluctuations or that is optimized for a low pH range to facilitate rapid accumulation of exclusively pure TPA.

Alongside the utilization of standardized PET feedstocks, establishing standardized bioreactor conditions by defining optimal solid (substrate) loading, enzyme loading, temperature, pH, agitation, and other parameters can ensure consistent, efficient, and scalable operations while maximizing monomer yield across diverse scales, from research laboratories to industrial environments. Nevertheless, as indicated in Tables 1 and 2, substantial discrepancies in specific key parameters reported to date, coupled with the sporadic reporting of others, highlight the necessity and challenges of conducting further comprehensive studies for standardization.

- Test every PET hydrolase (natural or de novo designed) on a uniform PET substrate with all key parameters described (Table 1).

- If defined waste PET sample is unavailable, use commercial amorphous PET film (e.g., Goodfellow ES301445) or its cryomilled form.

- For thermotolerant enzymes applicable at ≥65 °C, employ PET-based (amorphous PET or PET NP) HTS assays for enzyme engineering under industrial-like conditions (Table 2); small-molecule proxy substrates should be avoided.

- Evaluate top enzyme candidates in small bioreactors (<50 mL), followed by a sequential scale-up to 1 L, 100 L, and beyond (Fig. 3). Modify reaction parameters according to Table 2 at each step as required.

- Record pH-stat titration, accumulation of UV-absorbing products (e.g., TPA, MHET, and BHET, also known as TPA equivalents with the abbreviation TPAeq.), and polymer mass loss over time.

- Report initial depolymerization rate as molTPAeq. h−1 genzyme−1 or molTPAeq. h−1 molenzyme−1.

- Measure all polymer properties outlined in Table 1 before and after reaction—and ideally at intermediate timepoints—to track changes in crystallinity, molecular weight, surface area, etc.

Numerous recently discovered PET hydrolases are intrinsically thermolabile, rendering them less suitable candidates for free enzyme-based PET recycling without extensive and expensive thermostabilization engineering. Alternatively, they can be recombinantly expressed in (mostly mesophilic) microbial cell factories that can utilize at least one PET monomer for growth71,77,78,79. This concept of polymer degradation and monomer catabolism by a single microbe was recently coined PETtrophy80,81, analogous to consolidated bioprocessing in cellulose conversion82. However, achieving high enzymatic plastic depolymerization activities that align with the microbe's growth conditions, including pH, temperature, and salt concentration, is challenging. Molecular engineering tools are frequently absent for modifying microbial thermophiles83, leading to the infrequent demonstration of thermotolerant whole-cell catalysts for PET decomposition at its optimal temperature. The only example to date is engineered Clostridium thermocellum expressing LCC and its variants, though lacking monomer metabolism capability63,84. Other PET-metabolizing strains are constructed based on trivial microbial chassis that grow at temperatures below 40 °C85. Consequently, mesophilic PET hydrolases must be expressed at sufficiently high levels and tailored to enable the rapid release of growth-essential monomers into the medium, outpacing their translocation into microbial cells and subsequent metabolism. The efficacy of PET depolymerization under these conditions is expected to be significantly lower than that at elevated temperatures exceeding 65 °C. Thus, an upcycling strategy utilizing these strains to produce value-added chemicals should always be considered to realize potential economic viability. In addition, focusing on “easier” substrates that can be depolymerized faster at ambient temperatures may enhance the utility of these PET-trophic strains for stakeholders. These include PET oligomers that have been rigorously pretreated or pre-degraded67,86, as well as alternative polyesters with similar chemical compositions, such as the commercially available polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT)80. The time and cost savings from bypassing polymer and monomer separation may compensate the typically low depolymerization efficiency of whole-cell catalysts, providing significant benefits compared to free enzyme-based depolymerization.

Another extreme example is the in situ remediation of wastewater contaminated with synthetic microfibers, which, according to a current study, are primarily oligomeric PET87, for example, in effluents in textile production regions88 or general communal wastewater treatment plants. PET hydrolases derived from marine environments exhibiting significant salt tolerance28 can ultimately be utilized to construct environmentally resistant whole-cell catalysts when integrated into a comparably robust microbial chassis89,90. Other mesophilic wild-type enzymes may exhibit insufficient activity and stability under these harsh conditions, such as high salinity, extreme pH levels, or the presence of laundry detergents, necessitating further extensive enzyme optimization efforts91. Nonetheless, this may spark a heated debate about releasing genetically modified microbes (GMM)92, which is strictly prohibited in the EU (and other countries). In academic literature, this is referenced so far as a theoretical alternative in regions lacking other solutions93. However, as a result of intensive ongoing research activities, challenges associated with technical implementations and governmental regulations may be addressed shortly to maximize the benefits of GMMs in combating plastic pollution while mitigating risks of environmental release92.

Numerous high-throughput screening (HTS) assays have been developed in recent years for the discovery and engineering of PET hydrolases16,94. However, their specific limitations in areas such as technical availability, ease of handling, and reproducibility necessitate re-evaluation before a standard guideline can be established.

Several assays employ self-synthesized small-molecule surrogate substrates that resemble PET segments or degradation intermediates, such as mono- or bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET or BHET)95,96,97. While these proxy substrates offer practical benefits, including simplified dosing and the compatibility with established HTS platforms, they may result in a skewed identification of short ester hydrolyzing activity without PET depolymerization capability98,99,100, particularly in environmental samples or functional metagenomics. On the other hand, screening of mutant libraries derived from known PET hydrolases can benefit from this assay category96,101, as increased activity on MHET or BHET is frequently linked to the mitigation of their inhibitory effect, thereby improving overall PET decomposition performance. To minimize false positives, it is still highly advisable to consistently prioritize the direct use of PET polymers in HTS experimental setups. Optimal PET substrates must demonstrate uniform polymer properties, such as low-crystallinity and high specific surface area, facilitating rapid decomposition that can be observed within a constrained reaction volume, such as microplate wells or microdroplets, and a short timeframe, ideally under one hour. PET nanoparticles (NP), produced through solvent displacement processes102,103,104, are a polymeric substrate option characterized by a uniform size range of 100 ± 50 nm and lower molecular weights compared to their precursor materials (Table 1). These material properties promote their rapid enzymatic decomposition, even at ambient temperature36,48,102,103,104,105. PET NP can be used to detect microbial depolymerization activities by clear-zone assay when immobilized in agar plates. Similarly, the turbidity variations of homogenously suspended PET NP immobilized in other hydrogels can facilitate the determination of PET hydrolysis kinetics36,70,102. However, PET NP tend to agglomerate in buffered aqueous solutions, complicating their handling in small reaction volumes such as microplate wells or microdroplets. Therefore, when activity is quantified solely through the formation and detection of released monomers104,105, PET NP have no significant advantage over other amorphous PET materials, whether tailored from commercially available products or casted from polymer solution106,107,108. The casting method for preparing polymeric substrates can also incorporate fluorescent dyes, which can be detected in the supernatant during PET decomposition, providing an alternative to quantifying its monomers108. However, the use of toxic PET soluble organic solvents for HTS setups is considered suboptimal due to challenges in handling, high costs, environmental concerns, and laboratory safety issues.

TPA, MHET, and BHET are the main hydrolysis products of PET that can be detected at 240 nm. Aside from the standard quantification method of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the total amount of their formation can be easily estimated by simply measuring the total absorbance at 240 nm for HTS purposes101,106,109. When TPA needs to be precisely quantified as a final monomer, it can be converted to a hydroxylated form and detected by fluorimetric monitoring with a high detection sensitivity96,104,107,110. The quantification of the other monomer, EG, has been overlooked for a considerable period until recently. EG can now be accurately monitored by different fluorimetric assays based on enzymatic conversion111 or a biosensor112. In conjunction with other recently developed techniques for monitoring TPA105,113,114,115, living-cell based biosensors offer various options for assessing PET hydrolyzing activity, from precise endpoint determination of individual monomers to functional screening of metagenomic libraries. Microfluidics-based HTS also involves living cells, facilitating enzyme expression, biocatalysis, and product detection within a single microdroplet or microbead116. These methods may not effectively identify thermotolerant enzyme variants because the optimal temperatures for cell growth typically do not exceed 40 °C, while apparent PET depolymerization activity is generally detectable at temperatures above 50 °C. The same limitation may also pertain to other cell growth-based screening assays, such as enzyme surface display117,118. While these HTS assays primarily evaluate mesophilic PET hydrolases which typically necessitate costly and risky thermostabilization engineering prior to validating their potential for industrial PET recycling, these enzymes should be better suited to the alternative application scenarios at lower temperatures discussed above.

Consequently, an automated liquid handling system that incorporates: (i) enzyme expression and cell lysis at optimal cell-growth temperatures, (ii) PET depolymerization at elevated temperatures, and (iii) endpoint assessment of monomer release under optimal assay conditions should serve as an ideal standard workflow for screening thermotolerant PET hydrolases needed for industrial PET recycling (Table 2 and Fig. 3). A few recent studies demonstrated variations of this standard workflow, particularly characterized by the simultaneous detection of hydrolysis products and quantification of soluble recombinant enzymes in cell lysates through various optical techniques101,108. The latter can replace the labor-intensive and costly high-throughput protein purification step while maintaining high data accuracy of specific enzyme activities, which is crucial for machine-learning-guided enzyme engineering. To optimize these assays, proxy substrates like BHET and its derivatives96,101 can be replaced with, for example, cryomilled commercially available amorphous PET with defined characteristics62,68, particularly for HTS using microplate readers. This may enable solid loading of >10% in microplate wells to more accurately resemble standardized industrial conditions (Table 2).

The function-based HTS method is an essential component of the workflow. Given that agar-plate or microfluidics-based screening involves living cells, which prevents the detection of PET hydrolysis at elevated temperatures, microplate-based HTS (detailed in the lower part) may have the potential to be prioritized. Colorimetric or fluorometric methods, sensitive at different wavelengths, are optimal for the distinct quantification of functional enzyme concentrations in cell lysates and the monomers released from PET depolymerization. This approach enables rapid screening of large mutant libraries for efficient PET hydrolases while also producing high-quality data at a high throughput that can be used for machine-learning-guided enzyme engineering116.

Currently used endpoint measurements for assessing depolymerization efficacy allow for basic comparisons between engineered enzymes and their references, but they lack time-resolved data throughout the degradation process. As a result, molecular insights required to understand the mechanisms underlying interfacial biocatalysis reactions are frequently missing. Computational modeling based on recently resolved complex structures of various PET hydrolases with substrate analogues16 may elucidate the catalytic cycle in atomic detail. Still, it fails to account for other important aspects such as enzyme adsorption/desorption behavior and PET physical properties. Much evidence suggests that these latter aspects, which reflect non-covalent interactions, serve as key bottlenecks for the overall reaction. The most explicit example of this is the resilience of crystalline PET to enzymatic hydrolysis. However, small, soluble PET fragments, similar to those used in computational analyses, can be hydrolyzed very quickly119, which also implies that the main activation barrier for the overall process lies outside catalytic bond breakage. The classical way to single out the importance of different steps in a complex reaction is comparative kinetics, and this approach has two key requirements. Firstly, a simple yet realistic microkinetic reaction scheme, which introduces rate constants for the interconversion of substrate and intermediates, and secondly experimental methods that provide sufficient data to support kinetic modeling. At the current stage, none of these areas are well-developed for PET hydrolases, but some progress has been made. For example, limitations associated with an undefined concentration of the insoluble substrate have been addressed by introducing substrate area60,120, or attack site density119 as proxies for molar concentration. It has also proven useful to supplement the conventional conditions of substrate excess for steady-state kinetic analysis with measurements, where the enzyme is in excess concerning the substrate102,121. This latter experimental condition is the opposite of the conventional kinetic framework, and it has been termed inverse Michaelis–Menten kinetics122. A steady-state approximation under inverse conditions never occurs in homogenous reactions but may be relevant in two-phase systems as new reaction sites on the surface are replenished continuously123. Parameters from inverse kinetic analyses, particularly the maximal rate at high enzyme load, are of interest because they reflect both catalytic efficacy and the density of reaction or attack sites on the solid surface. Specifically, a combination of data obtained with either enzyme- or substrate-excess provides information on the maximal turnover (kcat in s−1), KM (Michaelis constant in M), and the density of hydrolysable sites on the PET surface (in molsites gPET−1)122. If experiments are only conducted under conditions of substrate excess, KM values will be in mass-based units, typically g L−1. This parameter can be useful for comparing different enzymes acting on the same substrate, but as mass-based KM values depend strongly on the SSA of the substrate, it is generally not meaningful to compare values obtained with different types of PET. Work along these lines has identified some general trends in PET hydrolase kinetics, which are listed in Table 2. For a number of the most proficient enzymes acting on insoluble PET at moderate temperature (30–50 °C), kcat was 0.5–2 s−1, and this was 1–2 orders of magnitude slower than their hydrolysis of the same bond in soluble PET fragments119,121,124. The same enzymes had KM values in the hundredths of nM range, and taken together, this implies strong substrate interactions but slow turnover compared to other hydrolases acting on native, soluble substrates125. A molecular description of these characteristics appears to be a promising avenue for further understanding of structure-function relationships for PET hydrolases. To achieve this, we will need better methods to quantify the accumulation and decay of intermediates; both enzyme-substrate complexes and PET fragments. Progress curves for these intermediates will elucidate the complex pathway from insoluble polymer to the monomers TPA and EG, and it will also provide the necessary experimental input for further kinetic modeling. Advanced knowledge in this respect may help to accelerate the late stage of the industrial recycling process, which is currently thought to be hampered by these hydrolysis intermediates. Finally, we encourage more experimental and computational research into the relationship between polymer conformation and enzyme activity. Some reports have pointed out a strong effect on catalysis of the trans-gauche isomerism in the PET chain52,67, and it has been proposed that constraints on isomerization may lessen gradually as PET chains are shortened in the enzymatic process126. Information on this would be important both for the fundamental understanding of the interfacial enzyme reaction and as a guide for enzyme engineering.

The increasing demand for sustainable plastic recycling solutions, integral to the bio-based circular economy and climate crisis mitigation, positions the biotechnological valorization of PET as a dynamic research field in the foreseeable future.

The successful implementation of several extensively customized PET hydrolases, which allow for nearly complete polymer-to-monomer conversion in less than 12 h on pilot or larger industrial scales9,29,57, suggests that fast kinetics is unlikely to be the primary constraint in this research domain. However, to maintain competitiveness, PET hydrolases, similar to other industrial enzymes, must undergo ongoing performance improvements, including enhanced enzyme kinetics and long-term stability, tailored pH optima, etc. Consequently, standard guidelines derived from research endeavors so far are discussed above and summarized in Box 1 and Tables 1 and 2. Other related research avenues, which have received considerably less attention yet appear to hold significant promise, should be explored with greater focus in the future. For instance, enzyme immobilization may enhance stability and facilitate multiple applications127,128. Also, the development of synergistic enzyme cocktails may enable reduced dosages or address mixed plastic waste129, a more complex challenge within the plastic pollution dilemma. For the latter, a moderate temperature range of 40–50 °C may be considered when extended operation time is acceptable, particularly when not all applied enzymes exhibit adequate half-lives at higher temperatures.

Simultaneously, understanding and optimizing process conditions should be afforded equal attention and effort as enzyme engineering in future research. This may involve optimizing melt-extrusion parameters56, investigating the feasibility of omitting energy-intensive micronization stages, or implementing alternative pre-treatment techniques130, all of which could reduce the costs of the current process11,12. A thorough understanding of the material properties associated with degradability is urgently required to assess the feasibility of current research aimed at developing highly efficient enzymes specifically for crystalline PET. These forthcoming research endeavors may address our knowledge gaps concerning the absent information in the standardized parameter set (Tables 1 and 2) that collectively impacts the future development of industrial PET recycling.

At the enzyme discovery stage, researchers should move beyond the trivial homology-based database mining and increase the use of novel bioinformatics- or AI-based tools to discover or design new PET hydrolase scaffolds29,47. Moreover, the previously underutilized classical function-based metagenomics or microbiological techniques can still be remarkably beneficial for discovering novel sequence or structural diversity of depolymerizing enzymes that have not yet been included in the digital repository. We propose a more efficient data-sharing approach by characterizing novel enzymes and all known mutants of benchmark enzymes, summarizing their biocatalytic properties in the standardized format shown in Table 2, and making them available online for free access. These will ultimately contribute significantly to the advancement of AI-based PET hydrolase engineering or design, as well as the development of specific AI models tailored for interfacial biocatalysis.

Motivated by the successful industrialization of enzymatic PET recycling, other hydrolysable waste plastics, such as polyurethanes, polylactides, and polyamides, are logically emerging as the next wave of substrates for potential biocatalytic depolymerization13,131,132,133. This ambition necessitates considering the lessons and experiences learned from PET, such as using polymer feedstocks with precisely defined properties and the need for standardized conditions for evaluating novel depolymerizing enzymes. Ultimately, we expect this article will inspire researchers to collaborate and develop similar guidelines to standardize the future bio-based plastic recycling industry.

Inside the trapped-ion quantum computer that carried out the chemistry simulation.Credit: The University of Sydney

A single atom has performed the first full quantum simulations of how certain molecules react to light. Researchers simulated the behaviour of three different organic molecules when they are hit with an energetic particle called a photon. They encoded these different parameters into a single ytterbium ion trapped in a vacuum using pulsating electric fields. The minimalistic approach could dramatically speed the path towards a ‘quantum advantage', says the team behind the feat. “It is incredibly hardware-efficient,” says experimental quantum physicist Ting Rei Tan.

A 41-year-old man has become the first person to receive a bladder transplant. Surgeons in the United States transplanted the bladder, together with a kidney, earlier this month, in an operation that lasted eight hours. “It's the first time he has been able to pee in seven years. For all of us, this is huge,” says Inderbir Gill, one of the surgeons who performed the surgery. The transplant was the first of five planned as part of an early-stage clinical trial.

A new genome-editing tool promises to insert entire genes, precisely and efficiently, into human DNA. The method uses a bacterial enzyme complex called a CRISPR-associated transposase (CAST), which can introduce full-length genes at targeted sites in a single step, without creating double-stranded breaks in DNA. Researchers used directed evolution — a process that harnesses the power of Darwinian natural selection in the lab — to produce an optimized version of the enzyme complex, called evoCAST, that showed a more than 400-fold improvement in efficiency over the non-evolved original.

Several researchers studying health inequities have had their grants from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) cancelled because it related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). The terminations have raised concerns about the extent to which research on health disparities will get swept up in the mass cuts to scientific research by the administration of US President Donald Trump. “It begs the question, what does DEI mean to the issuers of this notice? Does it mean the term ‘structural racism'? Does it mean ‘Black Americans'? Does it mean that we can no longer do rigorous science to really understand why the devastating burden of health disparities exist in this country and around the globe?” asks one affected researcher, nephrologist Dinushika Mohottige.

“Sapiocentrism” — the tendency to centre our world view around humans — could prevent us from grasping the importance of microorganisms to our planet's future, argues science writer Peter Forbes in his book, Thinking Small and Large. Microbial technologies are key to restoring our planet and ensuring our survival in an era of ecological collapse, Forbes says, if we can overcome the political barriers to their use at scale. He “reminds readers that microbes weathered planetary upheavals long before humans arrived, and are likely to persist long after we are gone”, writes environmental scientist Raquel Peixoto in her review.

Five years on from the early COVID-19 pandemic, there is evidence that broad stay-at-home orders did protect public health — but that other measures can work just as well, if a country's culture and resources make them possible to pull off. For example, by comparing Sweden (which did not enact strict lockdowns) with its neighbours Norway, Finland and Denmark (which did), researchers ultimately saw about the same level of excess deaths per capita, though spikes in death rates happened in different years. But there are no easy answers: ruthless contact tracing — which appears to have done the job, at least early on, in Taiwan — involved access to private data that many would find impractical and unethical. The real solution, say researchers, is to be better prepared so that pandemics don't spiral out of control in the first place.

João José Mendes de Oliveira and Karetta, a five-year-old German Shepherd, work to stop turtle poachers in Sal Rei, in the Cabo Verde islands. “The illegal hunters usually leave something behind — a piece of clothing, or even a footprint,” says Mendes de Oliveira. “The dog can smell that evidence and lead law-enforcement officers to the poacher.” Their efforts are working, he says, but there's more work to do. “Although poaching has been reduced, many turtles are injured or killed owing to sea pollution such as fish lines and fishing nets.” (Nature | 3 min read)

Forty years ago this month, scientists reported that human activities had created a hole in Earth's protective ozone layer. What happened next offers a masterclass in international science-diplomacy, argues a Nature editorial. (7 min read)

Jayant Vishnu Narlikar, a visionary Indian astrophysicist whose bold cosmological theories and deep dedication to science education reshaped India's scientific landscape, died on 20 May 2025 in Pune. He was 86.

Narlikar's life and work spanned an era of transformation in modern physics — from the post-Einsteinian revolutions of gravity to the institutional scaffolding of astrophysics in a newly independent India. For over six decades, he remained a tenacious challenger of orthodoxy and a luminous bridge between rigorous theory and the public imagination.

Born on 19 July 1938 in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, Narlikar grew up in an academic household. His father, Vishnu Vasudev Narlikar, was a noted mathematician. His early education was at Banaras Hindu University before he headed to the University of Cambridge for a PhD under the British astronomer Fred Hoyle.

Their collaboration produced the Hoyle–Narlikar theory of gravitation, a conformal theory deeply rooted in Mach's principle, and a striking early attempt to frame gravity not as a force transmitted by a field but as “action at a distance.” Their shared scepticism of the Big Bang model, which they felt was mathematically unsatisfactory due to its singularities, led to the development of the Quasi-Steady State Cosmology, an alternative vision of a universe without a beginning.

Though this work remained outside mainstream acceptance, Narlikar never flinched. He valued conceptual clarity and logical coherence above fashionable trends. “Division by zero is not allowed,” he often said, with the moral firmness of a mathematician.

Narlikar returned to India in 1972 and joined the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), assembling a group of scientists whose influence would shape Indian astrophysics for generations. Among them were Thanu Padmanabhan, Sanjeev Dhurandhar and Ajit Kembhavi — all leaders in fields from gravitational wave detection to data-intensive observational astronomy.

“He gave me total freedom of thought,” recalled Tarun Souradeep, now director of the Raman Research Institute and one of Narlikar's last students. “I worked on off-beat ideas, which he delighted in taking very seriously.” On one occasion, Souradeep submitted a paper with both their names; Narlikar promptly struck his own name off the author list. “It was entirely your work,” he said.

In 1988, Narlikar founded what many see as his most enduring institutional legacy: the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune. Conceived as a hub where scholars from across Indian universities could share resources and research time, IUCAA was a pioneering experiment in scientific democracy.

He structured it around an “eight-fold way” — a Buddhist-inspired schema outlining education, research, training and outreach — and persuaded architect Charles Correa to design the campus. Correa, coming off a project on classical Indian astronomy, was intrigued by the chance to build for modern stargazers.

The idea behind IUCAA stemmed from the practical challenges of astronomical research. High-quality telescopes are prohibitively expensive and often underused due to limited observing time. To address this, a shared institutional model was envisioned — one that would allow universities across the country to access advanced facilities collectively. From these beginnings in a cramped 100-square-foot apartment, IUCAA steadily grew into a vibrant, green research campus.

But Narlikar's influence extended well beyond academic circles. He was a dedicated science communicator and one of India's earliest and most prolific writers of science fiction. A story exploring black holes and time dilation, submitted anonymously, won him his first award and launched a writing career that brought scientific ideas to a wider audience. His accessible and engaging popular science books became fixtures in school curricula and earned him the UNESCO Kalinga Prize in 1996.

Narlikar saw public engagement as a core scientific duty. Under his leadership, IUCAA became deeply involved in science outreach, especially at the school level. He was an outspoken critic of pseudoscience and unscientific beliefs, including astrology, and consistently championed rational, evidence-based thinking. For him, values like justice and equality were not abstract ideals but guiding principles, lived out through his work and public advocacy.

His many honours included the Padma Bhushan (1965), the Padma Vibhushan (2004), the Prix Jules Janssen, and the Govind Swarup Lifetime Achievement Award from the Astronomical Society of India.

Narlikar is survived by his three daughters — Geeta, Girija and Leelavati — all scientists. His wife, mathematician Mangala Narlikar, with whom he shared both a household and a commitment to intellectual integrity, died in 2023.

It is rare to find a scientist equally at ease formulating cosmological theories, founding institutions, mentoring iconoclasts and penning science fiction. Rarer still to find one who, until the end, remained curious, civil and unshakably principled.

In our last conversation in January 2025, he returned, as he often did, to first principles: “The universe,” he mused, “is not obliged to follow our prejudices. But we are obliged to understand it honestly.”

It would be hard to overstate the impact that Peter Thiel has had on the career of Sam Altman. After Altman sold his first startup in 2012, Thiel bankrolled his first venture fund, Hydrazine Capital. Thiel saw Altman as an inveterate optimist who stood at “the absolute epicenter, maybe not of Silicon Valley, but of a Silicon Valley zeitgeist.” As Thiel put it, “If you had to look for the one person who represented a millennial tech person, it would be Altman.”

Each year, Altman would point Thiel toward the most promising startup at Y Combinator–Airbnb in 2012, Stripe in 2013, Zenefits in 2014–and Thiel would swallow hard and invest, even though he sometimes felt like he was being swept up in a hype cycle. Following Altman's advice brought Thiel's Founders Fund some immense returns.

Thiel, meanwhile, became the loudest voice critiquing the lack of true technological progress amidst all the hype. “Forget flying cars,” he quipped during a 2012 Stanford lecture. “We're still sitting in traffic.”

By the time Altman took over Y Combinator in 2014, he had internalized Thiel's critique of “tech stagnation” and channeled it to remake YC as an investor in “hard tech” moonshots like nuclear energy, supersonic planes—and artificial intelligence. Now it was Altman who was increasingly taking his cues from Thiel.

And if it's hard to exaggerate Thiel's effect on Altman, it's similarly easy to understate the influence that an AI-obsessed autodidact named Eliezer Yudkowsky had on Thiel's early investments in AI.

Though he has since become perhaps the world's foremost AI doomsday prophet, Yudkowsky started out as a magnetic, techno-optimistic wunderkind who excelled at rallying investors, researchers, and eccentrics around a quest to “accelerate the singularity.”

In this excerpt from the forthcoming book The Optimist, Keach Hagey describes how Thiel's relationship with Yudkowsky set the stage for the generative AI revolution: How it was Yudkowsky who first inspired one of the founders of DeepMind to imagine and build a “superintelligence,” and Yudkowsky who introduced the founders of DeepMind to Thiel, one of their first investors. How Thiel's conversations with Altman about DeepMind would help inspire the creation of OpenAI. And how Thiel, as one of Yudkowsky's most important backers, inadvertently seeded the AI-apocalyptic subcultures that would ultimately play a role in Sam Altman's ouster, years later, as CEO of OpenAI.

Like Sam Altman, Peter Thiel had long been obsessed with the possibility that one day computers would become smarter than humans and unleash a self-­reinforcing cycle of exponential technological progress, an old science fiction trope often referred to as “the singularity.” The term was first introduced by the mathematician and Manhattan Project adviser John von Neumann in the 1950s, and popularized by the acclaimed sci-­fi author Vernor Vinge in the 1980s. Vinge's friend Marc Stiegler, who worked on cybersecurity for the likes of Darpa while drafting futuristic novels, recalled once spending an afternoon with Vinge at a restaurant outside a sci-­fi convention “swapping stories we would never write because they were both horrific and quite possible. We were too afraid some nutjob would pick one of them up and actually do it.”

Among the many other people influenced by Vinge's fiction was Eliezer Yudkowsky. Born into an Orthodox Jewish family in 1979 in Chicago, Yudkowsky was son of a psychiatrist mother and a physicist father who went on to work at Bell Labs and Intel on speech recognition, and was himself a devoted sci-­fi fan. Yudkowsky began reading science fiction at age 7 and writing it at age 9. At 11, he scored a 1410 on the SAT. By seventh grade, he told his parents he could no longer tolerate school. He did not attend high school. By the time he was 17, he was painfully aware that he was not like other people, posting a web page declaring that he was a “genius” but “not a Nazi.” He rejected being defined as a “male teenager,” instead preferring to classify himself as an “Algernon,” a reference to the famous Daniel Keyes short story about a lab mouse who gains enhanced intelligence. Thanks to Vinge, he had discovered the meaning of life. “The sole purpose of this page, the sole purpose of this site, the sole purpose of anything I ever do as an Algernon is to accelerate the Singularity,” he wrote.

Around this time, Yudkowsky discovered an obscure mailing list of a society calling itself the Extropians, which was the subject of a 1994 article in Wired that happened to include their email address at the end. Founded by philosopher Max More in the 1980s, Extropianism is a form of pro-­science super-­optimism that seeks to fight entropy—­the universal law that says things fall apart, everything tends toward chaos and death—­on all fronts. In practical terms, this meant signing up to have their bodies—­or at least heads—­frozen at negative 321 degrees Fahrenheit at the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Scottsdale, Arizona, after they died. They would be revived once humanity was technologically advanced enough to do so. More philosophically, fighting entropy meant abiding by five principles: Boundless Expansion, Self-­Transformation, Dynamic Optimism, Intelligent Technology, and Spontaneous Order. (Dynamic Optimism, for example, involved a technique called selective focus, in which you'd concentrate on only the positive aspects of a given situation.)

Robin Hanson, who joined the movement and became renowned for creating prediction markets, described attending multilevel Extropian parties at big houses in Palo Alto at the time. “And I was energized by them, because they were talking about all these interesting ideas. And my wife was put off because they were not very well presented, and a little weird,” he said. “We all thought of ourselves as people who were seeing where the future was going to be, and other people didn't get it. Eventually—­eventually—­we'd be right, but who knows exactly when.”

More's co­founder of the journal Extropy, Tom Bell, aka T. O. Morrow (Bell claims that Morrow is a distinct persona and not simply a pen name), wrote about systems of “polycentric law” that could arise organically from voluntary transactions between agents free of government interference, and of “Free Oceana,” a potential Extropian settlement on a man-­made floating island in international waters. (Bell ended up doing pro bono work years later for the Seasteading Institute, for which Thiel provided seed funding.) If this all sounds more than a bit libertarian, that's because it was. The WIRED article opens at one such Extropian gathering, during which an attendee shows up dressed like the “State,” wearing a vinyl bustier, miniskirt, and chain harness top and carrying a riding crop, dragging another attendee dressed up as “the Taxpayer” on a leash on all fours.

The mailing list and broader Extropian community had only a few hundred members, but among them were a number of famous names, including Hanson; Marvin Minsky, the Turing Award–winning scientist who founded MIT's AI lab in the late 1950s; Ray Kurzweil, the computer scientist and futurist whose books would turn “the singularity” into a household word; Nick Bostrom, the Swedish philosopher whose writing would do the same for the supposed “existential risk” posed by AI; Julian Assange, a decade before he founded WikiLeaks; and three people—­Nick Szabo, Wei Dai, and Hal Finney—­rumored to either be or be adjacent to the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.

“It is clear from even a casual perusal of the Extropians archive (maintained by Wei Dai) that within a few months, teenage Eliezer Yudkowsky became one of this extraordinary cacophony's preeminent voices,” wrote the journalist Jon Evans in his history of the movement. In 1996, at age 17, Yudkowsky argued that superintelligences would be a great improvement over humans, and could be here by 2020.

Two members of the Extropian community, internet entrepreneurs Brian and Sabine Atkins—­who met on an Extropian mailing list in 1998 and were married soon after—­were so taken by this message that in 2000 they bankrolled a think tank for Yudkowsky, the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence. At 21, Yudkowsky moved to Atlanta and began drawing a nonprofit salary of around $20,000 a year to preach his message of benevolent superintelligence. “I thought very smart things would automatically be good,” he said. Within eight months, however, he began to realize that he was wrong—­way wrong. AI, he decided, could be a catastrophe.

“I was taking someone else's money, and I'm a person who feels a pretty deep sense of obligation towards those who help me,” Yudkowsky explained. “At some point, instead of thinking, ‘If superintelligences don't automatically determine what is the right thing and do that thing that means there is no real right or wrong, in which case, who cares?' I was like, ‘Well, but Brian Atkins would probably prefer not to be killed by a superintelligence.' ” He thought Atkins might like to have a “fallback plan,” but when he sat down and tried to work one out, he realized with horror that it was impossible. “That caused me to actually engage with the underlying issues, and then I realized that I had been completely mistaken about everything.”

The Atkinses were understanding, and the institute's mission pivoted from making artificial intelligence to making friendly artificial intelligence. “The part where we needed to solve the friendly AI problem did put an obstacle in the path of charging right out to hire AI researchers, but also we just surely didn't have the funding to do that,” Yudkowsky said. Instead, he devised a new intellectual framework he dubbed “rationalism.” (While on its face, rationalism is the belief that humankind has the power to use reason to come to correct answers, over time it came to describe a movement that, in the words of writer Ozy Brennan, includes “reductionism, materialism, moral non-­realism, utilitarianism, anti-­deathism and transhumanism.” Scott Alexander, Yudkowsky's intellectual heir, jokes that the movement's true distinguishing trait is the belief that “Eliezer Yudkowsky is the rightful calif.”)

In a 2004 paper, “Coherent Extrapolated Volition,” Yudkowsky argued that friendly AI should be developed based not just on what we think we want AI to do now, but what would actually be in our best interests. “The engineering goal is to ask what humankind ‘wants,' or rather what we would decide if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together, etc.,” he wrote. In the paper, he also used a memorable metaphor, originated by Bostrom, for how AI could go wrong: If your AI is programmed to produce paper clips, if you're not careful, it might end up filling the solar system with paper clips.

In 2005, Yudkowsky attended a private dinner at a San Francisco restaurant held by the Foresight Institute, a technology think tank founded in the 1980s to push forward nanotechnology. (Many of its original members came from the L5 Society, which was dedicated to pressing for the creation of a space colony hovering just behind the moon, and successfully lobbied to keep the United States from signing the United Nations Moon Agreement of 1979 due to its provision against terraforming celestial bodies.) Thiel was in attendance, regaling fellow guests about a friend who was a market bellwether, because every time he thought some potential investment was hot, it would tank soon after. Yudkowsky, having no idea who Thiel was, walked up to him after dinner. “If your friend was a reliable signal about when an asset was going to go down, they would need to be doing some sort of cognition that beat the efficient market in order for them to reliably correlate with the stock going downwards,” Yudkowsky said, essentially reminding Thiel about the efficient-market hypothesis, which posits that all risk factors are already priced into markets, leaving no room to make money from anything besides insider information. Thiel was charmed.

Thiel and Yudkowsky began having occasional dinners together. Yudkowsky came to regard Thiel “as something of a mentor figure,” he said. In 2005, Thiel started funding Yudkowsky's Singularity Institute, and the following year they teamed up with Ray Kurzweil—­whose book The Singularity Is Near had become a bestseller—­to create the Singularity Summit at Stanford University. Over the next six years, it expanded to become a prominent forum for futurists, transhumanists, Extropians, AI researchers, and science fiction authors, including Bostrom, More, Hanson, Stanford AI professor Sebastian Thrun, XPrize founder Peter Diamandis, and Aubrey de Grey, a gerontologist who claims humans can eventually defeat aging. Skype co­founder Jaan Tallinn, who participated in the summit, was inspired by Yudkowsky to become one of the primary funders of research dedicated to reducing existential risk from AI. Another summit participant, physicist Max Tegmark, would go on to co-found the Future of Life Institute.

Vernor Vinge himself even showed up, looking like a public school chemistry teacher with his Walter White glasses and tidy gray beard, cheerfully reminding the audience that when the singularity comes, “We're no longer in the driver's seat.”

In 2010, one of the AI researchers whom Yudkowsky invited to speak at the summit was Shane Legg, a New Zealand–­born mathematician, computer scientist, and ballet dancer who had been obsessed with building superintelligence ever since Yudkowsky had introduced him to the idea a decade before. Legg had been working at Intelligenesis, a New York–­based startup founded by the computer scientist Ben Goertzel that was trying to develop the world's first AI. Its best-­known product was WebMind, an ambitious software project that attempted to predict stock market trends. Goertzel, who had a PhD in mathematics, had been an active poster on the Extropians mailing list for years, sparring affectionately with Yudkowsky on transhumanism and libertarianism. (He was in favor of the former but not so much the latter.) Back in 2000, Yudkowsky came to speak at Goertzel's company (which would go bankrupt within a year). Legg points to the talk as the moment when he started to take the idea of superintelligence seriously, going beyond the caricatures in the movies. Goertzel and Legg began referring to the concept as “artificial general intelligence.”

Legg went on to get his own PhD, writing a dissertation, “Machine Super Intelligence,” that noted the technology could become an existential threat, and then moved into a postdoctoral fellowship at University College London's Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, a lab that encompassed neuroscience, machine learning, and AI. There, he met a gaming savant from London named Demis Hassabis, the son of a Singaporean mother and Greek Cypriot father. Hassabis had once been the second-­ranked chess player in the world under the age of 14. Now he was focused on building an AI inspired by the human brain. Legg and Hassabis shared a common, deeply unfashionable vision. “It was basically eye-­rolling territory,” Legg told the journalist Cade Metz. “If you talked to anybody about general AI, you would be considered at best eccentric, at worst some kind of delusional, nonscientific character.” Legg thought it could be built in the academy, but Hassabis, who had already tried a startup and failed, knew better. The only way to do it was through industry. And there was one investor who would be an obvious place to start: Peter Thiel.

Legg and Hassabis came to the 2010 Singularity Summit as presenters, yes, but really to meet Thiel, who often invited summit participants to his townhouse in San Francisco, according to Metz's account. Hassabis spoke on the first day of the summit, which had moved to a hotel in downtown San Francisco, outlining his vision for an AI that took inspiration from the human brain. Legg followed the next day with a talk on how AI needed to be measurable to move forward. Afterward, they went for cocktails at Thiel's Marina District home, with its views of both the Golden Gate Bridge and the Palace of Fine Arts, and were delighted to see a chessboard out on a table. They wove through the crowd and found Yudkowsky, who led them over to Thiel for an introduction. Trying to play it cool, Hassabis skipped the hard sell and began with chess, a topic he knew was dear to Thiel's heart. The game had stood the test of time, Hassabis said, because the knight and bishop had such an interesting tension—­equal in value, but profoundly different in strengths and weaknesses. Thiel invited them to return the next day to tell him about their startup.

In the morning, they pitched Thiel, fresh from a workout, across his dining room table. Hassabis said they were building AGI inspired by the human brain, would initially measure its progress by training it to play games, and were confident that advances in computing power would drive their breakthroughs. Thiel balked at first, but over the course of weeks agreed to invest $2.25 million, becoming the as-­yet-­unnamed company's first big investor. A few months later, Hassabis, Legg, and their friend, the entrepreneur Mustafa Suleyman, officially co­founded DeepMind, a reference to the company's plans to combine “deep learning,” a type of machine learning that uses layers of neural networks, with actual neuroscience. From the beginning, they told investors that their goal was to develop AGI, even though they feared it could one day threaten humanity's very existence.

It was through Thiel's network that DeepMind recruited his fellow PayPal veteran Elon Musk as an investor. Thiel's Founders Fund, which had invested in Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, invited Hassabis to speak at a conference in 2012, and Musk was in attendance. Hassabis laid out his 10-­year plan for DeepMind, touting it as a “Manhattan Project” for AI years before Altman would use the phrase. Thiel recalled one of his investors joking on the way out that the speech was impressive, but he felt the need to shoot Hassabis to save the human race.

The next year, Luke Nosek, a cofounder of both PayPal and Founders Fund who is friends with Musk and sits on the SpaceX board, introduced Hassabis to Musk. Musk took Hassabis on a tour of SpaceX's headquarters in Los Angeles. When the two settled down for lunch in the company cafeteria, they had a cosmic conversation. Hassabis told Musk he was working on the most important thing in the world, a superintelligent AI. Musk responded that he, in fact, was working on the most important thing in the world: turning humans into an interplanetary species by colonizing Mars. Hassabis responded that that sounded great, so long as a rogue AI did not follow Musk to Mars and destroy humanity there too. Musk got very quiet. He had never really thought about that. He decided to keep tabs on DeepMind's technology by investing in it.

In December 2013, Hassabis stood on stage at a machine-learning conference at Harrah's in Lake Tahoe and demonstrated DeepMind's first big breakthrough: an AI agent that could learn to play and then quickly master the classic Atari video game Breakout without any instruction from humans. DeepMind had done this with a combination of deep neural networks and reinforcement learning, and the results were so stunning that Google bought the company for a reported $650 million a month later.

The implications of DeepMind's achievement—­which was a major step toward a general-­purpose intelligence that could make sense of a chaotic world around it and work toward a goal—­were not widely understood until the company published a paper on its findings in the journal Nature more than a year later. But Thiel, as a DeepMind investor, understood them well, and discussed them with Altman. In February 2014, a month after Google bought DeepMind, Altman wrote a post on his personal blog titled “AI” that declared the technology the most important tech trend that people were not paying enough attention to.

“To be clear, AI (under the common scientific definition) likely won't work. You can say that about any new technology, and it's a generally correct statement. But I think most people are far too pessimistic about its chances,” he wrote, adding that “artificial general intelligence might work, and if it does, it will be the biggest development in technology ever.”

A little more than a year later, Altman teamed up with Elon Musk to cofound OpenAI as a noncorporate counterweight to Google's DeepMind. And with that, the race to build artificial general intelligence was on.

This was a race that Yudkowsky had helped set off. But as it picked up speed, Yudkowsky himself was growing increasingly alarmed about what he saw as the extinction-level danger it posed. He was still influential among investors, researchers, and eccentrics, but now as a voice of extreme caution.

Yudkowsky was not personally involved in OpenAI, but his blog, LessWrong, was widely read among the AI researchers and engineers who worked there. (While still at Stripe, OpenAI cofounder Greg Brockman had organized a weekly LessWrong reading group.) The rationalist ideas Yudkowsky espoused overlapped significantly with those of the Effective Altruism movement, which was turning much of its attention to preventing existential risk from AI.

A few months after this race spilled into full public view with OpenAI's release of ChatGPT in November 2022, Yudkowsky published an essay in Time magazine arguing that unless the current wave of generative AI research was halted, “literally everyone on Earth will die.”

Thiel felt that Yudkowsky had become “extremely black-pilled and Luddite.” And two of OpenAI's board members had ties to Effective Altruism. Less than a week before Altman was briefly ousted as CEO in the fall of 2023, Thiel warned his friend, “You don't understand how Eliezer has programmed half the people in your company to believe this stuff.” Thiel's warning came with some guilt that he had created the many-headed monster that was now coming for his friend.

While Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has taken an axe to the federal workforce, the group itself is hiring.

The US DOGE Service, formerly the US Digital Service (USDS), has been interviewing potential candidates in recent weeks and months, even offering salaries on the highest end of the government pay scale. WIRED spoke with one person who made it through part of the DOGE interview process about what it was like.

According to the interviewee, there appear to be five phases to the DOGE hiring process, all executed quickly over a two- to three-week period. The first step in the process is a short 15-minute screening call with a recruiter, followed by a tech assessment that applicants have three days to complete. If applicants pass this screening, they'll be asked to participate in two different technical interviews with DOGE staff. The fifth and final interview is a placement interview, where applicants would learn more about what kinds of work they would be assigned if hired.

“I think it's fair to call it a dream job,” the interviewee, who asked not to be named in order to protect their privacy, says of the USDS in its pre-Trump administration form. The interviewee says they were “impressed” by a December 2023 interview with Mina Hsiang, then the administrator of the USDS, on The Verge's Decoder podcast. She described how the department, since its creation in 2014 by former president Barack Obama, brought a small group of technologists together to improve tech services across the federal government. The interviewee had applied to work at USDS in previous years, and relistening to Hsiang's interview “was the inspiration to apply again,” they say.

The interviewee knew several federal workers who had already been laid off as part of the DOGE's incursion into federal agencies, and though it was “top of the top of mind,” they say they were still “excited about getting an interview.”

During the initial 15-minute call, the recruiter outlined some of the possible projects DOGE might undertake. These included, the interviewee says, “leveraging AI to improve medical services for veterans,” “streamlining federal aid applications from Americans who experience natural disasters like floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes,” and “improving the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and expanding Americans' access to financial assistance for higher education.”

These details about possible projects were also laid out in an email the interviewee received before the phone call, inviting them to speak to the recruiter. The interviewee, who had applied to USDS multiple times both before and shortly after the new Trump administration, says they weren't sure how or why their application had caught the eye of the new DOGE Service. “Maybe they were just looking for a coder,” they say.

Seeing USDS referred to as the “US DOGE Service,” the interviewee says, made them “want to barf” because “it represented the hollowing out of the organization I appreciated. I didn't know what to make of it, since I applied on a lark and hated what DOGE was doing. But I was ready to learn what they wanted and to explore what impact I could have.”

DOGE, according to the interviewee's conversation with the recruiter, is looking to hire software engineers, software development and IT operations engineers, and project managers, all of which would be listed at GS-13 through 15 with salaries between $120,000 and $190,000. This salary range, according to a former USDS employee with knowledge of its hiring processes, is similar to what has been offered to USDS employees in previous years. WIRED previously reported that some members of DOGE with no government experience are drawing salaries well above $120,000, often making as much as or more than federal workers years into their government service. An unsigned agreement obtained by WIRED called for the Department of Labor to reimburse the USDS up to $1.3 million for using four DOGE affiliates over an 18-month period.

For the tech assessment portion of the application, the interviewee was asked to “create a simple website to analyze federal regulations to allow for more digestible and actionable insights to be made on potential deregulation efforts across the government” that are listed in the Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR). This exercise, as it turns out, may be particularly relevant to DOGE's work. Last month, WIRED reported that DOGE affiliate Christopher Sweet has been put in charge of an initiative to use AI to crawl through the eCFR to identify regulations that could possibly be relaxed or rescinded. This work has already started at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The interviewee was not ultimately hired.

“I feel disappointed at the outcome, not unlike other job opportunities that don't proceed,” the interviewee says. “I also feel frustrated to be rejected by the organization that has destroyed the original USDS that I respected.”

But, they say, they're not deterred by the rejection. “In reading about some of DOGE's people's public behavior, I remain confident in the quality of my skills, including as compared to what I see of theirs,” they say.

On DOGE's website, a “Join DOGE” page states that it is “looking for world-class talent to work long hours identifying/eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse. These are full-time, salaried positions for software engineers, product managers, designers, lawyers, data scientists, business analysts, cybersecurity professionals, and other fields.” Previously, the US Digital Service application allowed applicants to choose from one of over 20 “areas of expertise” from a drop-down menu, ranging from artificial intelligence to content strategy to accessibility. The dropdown menu for the DOGE Service, on the “Join DOGE” site, lists only 11, including software engineering, cybersecurity, and business analysis. For example, accessibility is no longer listed as an area of expertise on the new DOGE hiring website. This narrowing of roles and expertise, the former USDS employee says, shows how the goals and priorities of the DOGE Service have drastically shifted. If a priority, for instance, is removing DEI language from the websites of different government agencies, certain roles just might no longer be necessary.

The beginnings of this change took place on President Donald Trump's first day in office, when he signed an executive order renaming and repurposing the USDS as the US DOGE Service.

Under the executive order, there are technically two DOGEs: The initial USDS that has been repackaged into the US DOGE Service, which the executive order states will be granted “access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems,” and the second DOGE, a temporary organization headed by the USDS administrator, which will run until July 4, 2026. This temporary organization allows DOGE to hire what are known as Special Government Employees (SGEs)—people who join the government for a period of up to 130 days in a year before returning to the private sector. Musk has been one such SGE.

Many of the people at Musk's DOGE have included young, inexperienced engineers who have access to sensitive data across agencies, and conservative lawyers and Trump-world veterans who support the mission of cutting the federal workforce and using data to facilitate the administration's agenda, particularly on immigration.

USDS, meanwhile, had more than 100 employees at the start of Trump's second term. Many departed after the department's transition into the DOGE service and the “firewall” built between Musk's DOGE and the legacy USDS. Now, only a few dozen of the original employees remain.

This situation has made recruiting new and qualified talent to the permanent USDS more difficult, says a current USDS employee not authorized to speak to the press. The employee tells WIRED that USDS has hired a contractor to manage talent acquisition for the next generation of USDS employees.

The White House and a member of DOGE's recruitment team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Marshall Takes On Sonos With Its First Soundbar","https://www.wired.com/story/marshall-takes-on-sonos-with-its-first-soundbar/","Tue, 20 May 2025 06:00:00 GMT","

All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.

Moving into a new product category is a nervy undertaking for any company, and the current climate of tariff roulette only adds another level of uncertainty. But Marshall, manufacturer of iconic guitar amps and a growing portfolio of wireless speakers and headphones, is marching on regardless, with the launch of its first soundbar. And at $1,000, the Atmos-capable Heston 120 is an ambitious first entry.

“This is our most expensive product. And honestly, that's a little bit scary,” Gustaf Rosell, Marshall's chief product and innovation officer, tells WIRED in an interview. “But since it's a new segment for us, we made the decision that we wanted to start at the high end. We don't always do that, but in this case we thought it was important to make a statement—to show that we are really serious about it.

The idea of adding a soundbar to its line up is one that has been kicking around company discussions for the past five years, Rosell says, but been in production for about three of them. The result is the Heston 120, a 5.1.2-channel Atmos and DTS X soundbar, with 11 separate drivers positioned to offer a wide and high sound field from a single box.

Tuning a product for so many channels has been a new challenge for Marshall, and it brought new expertise on board to help—even pulling in talent from the automotive industry for their multi-channel experience. “Right now we have two PhDs in house, it's that level of competence,” Rosell adds. “We also worked really closely with Dolby to help us with some difficult measurements, to ensure that we are placing objects of sound accurately in a room.”

The Heston 120 leans into Marshall's recognizable product design language, borrowed from its guitar amps.

However, a particular focus for the sound team, Rosell tells us, has been about getting the balance right between sounding good for TV and also good for music—a common difficulty for multi-channel audio products. The Heston 120 certainly comes with plenty of music options to put it to the test, including AirPlay 2, Googlecast, and Bluetooth LE, plus Tidal and Spotify Connect.

“Music playback is an area where we have been able to lean into our current expertise, and use some of the modelling from our portable speakers to ensure all of the drivers in the Heston 120 are working just as well together in a more classical stereo setup too. And if I'm to be a little bit bold, we've beaten everything we've heard from competitors. It's one of the things I am most proud of with this product.""

Another key focus for the team was the product's design, but not perhaps in the way that anyone familiar with Marshall products might think. While its speakers are well known for their distinct look, reminiscent of the brand's famous amplifiers, Heston 120 dials back that approach, just a bit.

“Many products in this area look pretty much the same, they're trying to blend in, and when TVs are doing their best to hide themselves more and more, you do need to find the right tone.

“But Heston is a conscious design choice for people who want something different—we are not trying to hide. It's a bold statement, but not as bold as we could have been. I think we've found a balance that feels authentic.”

Rosell is under no illusion that Heston is launching into a busy, and competitive space. He concedes that the Heston 120 is not aimed at audiophiles who might want a more involved setup, but believes it can compete with the big names at its premium price point.

“We benchmarked against the Sonos Arc Ultra, against Sennheiser, against Sony, even against Devialet—I mean it's a lot more expensive, but we really wanted to match it and I think we are doing in most areas, despite the price difference."" Does Heston represents a step up in performance for Marshall, and how it is positioning itself in the market, we ask? “Yes I would say so,” Rosell replies. ""We have a lot of respect for Sonos, particularly in how it has managed to push the lower frequencies without having something huge in size. But we think can be on par—even better in certain ways. I think the bass performance we have in Heston will surprise people.”

The Heston 120 is built around getting the most out of a single box. Rosell says he has heard the frustration from customers about how complex some soundbar setups have got now, and that he believes that Marshall customers are looking for performance, but with simplicity. With Heston, ease of use was important, which kept the brand focused on the one-box design.

The Heston 120 has two HDMI inputs (one eARC), an RCA in, a sub out, and an Ethernet connection if you don't want to use Wi-Fi.

However, that isn't to say there isn't more in the pipeline from the company, for those who want it. The company plans to release a smaller soundbar, the Heston 60, and a wireless subwoofer, the Heston Sub 200, later on this year, plus it is exploring the possibility of adding satellite speakers too—and not just from Marshall's product catalogue.

“We have been very keen from early on about using Bluetooth LE {Low Energy} and Auracast,” adds Rosell. “That opens up the possibility for customers to use other compatible products—like subwoofer or satellites—to add to their experience. So yes, the ambition is that you can use something like Acton or one of our portable speakers as satellite speakers, or even products from other brands too, depending on how the technology is implemented.

“We are not for building proprietary environments when there is a good open standard available. That's the way we think things should go, and it's something we're interested to experiment with.”

The Marshall Heston 120 can be preordered on the company's website today and will be available from June 3. The rest of the Heston family will follow later this year, with release dates still to be confirmed.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","China's Effort to Build a Competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink Is Off to a Bumpy Start","https://www.wired.com/story/china-starlink-competitor-satellites/","Tue, 20 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

If you gaze up at the night sky, there's a good chance you'll spot a trail of fast-moving, bright dots—newly launched Starlink satellites. But you might soon also see something else: spacecraft from Chinese projects building their own Starlink-like low Earth orbit satellite internet networks. More than 100 satellites have been launched from China since August—the first batches of two mega-constellations that are aiming to have about 28,000 satellites combined when they're completed.

The two Chinese projects are officially called Guowang and Qianfan, but they each have a confusing set of alternative names in English due to their corporate structures and language differences. The former, which is also known as Xingwang or SatNet, is primarily focused on domestic telecommunications and national security use cases. The latter, which is also known as Spacesail or SSST, is more oriented toward providing service to foreign telecom companies. So far, Qianfan has signed deals with Brazil, Malaysia, and Thailand and has said it's eyeing dozens of other markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Compared to Starlink, which operates more than 7,000 satellites, China is clearly still playing catch-up. But Guowang and Qianfan are joining a group of Starlink competitors around the world accelerating their operations, and they could give the market leader a run for its money in the end. The newcomers also stand to benefit as CEO Elon Musk's deepening entanglements in US politics raises reputational and security risks for SpaceX (Starlink's parent company) globally.

“2023 and 2024 were the years of Starlink deployment. 2025 is the year of other actors getting into the game,” says Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory who has been tracking satellite constellations globally. “In the West, we severely underreport the commercial side of the Chinese space industry.”

But as Guowang and Qianfan launch their first batches of satellites, they are also running into troubles, including higher numbers of faulty satellites than SpaceX, bureaucratic hurdles, and limited rocket launch capacity. And if they don't launch enough satellites into space soon, they could be asked by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the United Nations body that coordinates space launches, to scale down the size of their planned constellations.

Guowang and Qianfan couldn't be reached for comment. SpaceX didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.

As of last month, Qianfan has launched 90 satellites that will provide broadband internet service for ground users, while Guowang has launched 29. The latter has also launched around a dozen experimental satellites since 2023, but it hasn't been transparent about their purpose, and it seemingly doesn't count them toward the numbers in its official constellation.

While Qianfan is slightly ahead, it is also grappling with a significant issue: a concerningly high rate of possible faulty satellites compared to other, similar projects. Unlike Starlink, which publishes GPS information of its satellites in orbit, the Chinese companies have disclosed little about how their satellites are doing. Instead, researchers have relied on data collected by the US Space Force, which tracks all space objects by radar and releases public data about them.

Jonathan McDowell, a researcher who maintains a website that analyzes information collected about low Earth orbit satellite networks, says that, of the 90 satellites that Qianfan has launched, 13 seem to have exhibited irregular behavior, namely they didn't rise up to their target orbit height along with their peers. Qianfan's second batch, which it launched in October 2024, contained only five satellites that reached their planned height out of 18, according to McDowell.

McDowell says these satellites are not necessarily dead—some could be dormant, waiting for better positioning opportunities—but overall, Qianfan's satellites clearly underperform compared to others. While Starlink started with about a 3 percent failure rate, it has since gone down to less than 0.5 percent, according to McDowell's data. OneWeb, the British mega-constellation with over 600 satellites, contains only two failed ones that are stuck in space.

According to the Shanghai local government, Qianfan's second batch of satellites are made by a different manufacturing supplier, Genesat, which could be related to why it performed worse than other batches. It was the first time Genesat delivered mass-produced satellites, a press release at launch time said.

Another problem is that Qianfan and Guowang are literally aiming higher. Both projects have opted to put their satellites in higher orbits than Starlink, making their failed satellites harder to deorbit and more likely to become long-term space debris. Given the planned sizes of these mega-constellations, their higher failure rates could mean that space will be crowded with even more dead satellites.

“What can happen is that you will have so many satellites operating in the same orbital shell that you're constantly having to move your satellite out of concerns of close approach,” says

Victoria Samson, chief director of space security and stability at Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit organization focusing on outer space sustainability.

That will create logistical burdens and extra costs for other satellite operators, and Samson says there  's an urgent need to establish coordination mechanisms between nations to avoid space collisions as mega-constellation projects pick up their pace. “Right now, there's no real space traffic control system,” she explains.

While the Chinese projects are ahead of some competitors—Amazon, for instance, launched its first batch of 27 Project Kuiper internet satellites in April—they are very far behind Starlink as well as their own ambitious goals.

Before companies can send a satellite into space, they need to register their road map with the ITU and reserve the radio frequency spectrum for their spacecraft to communicate with the ground. According to ITU filings, Guowang wants to have nearly 13,000 satellites in total, while Qianfan plans to have more than 15,000.

It's not unusual for companies to make overly aspirational satellite plans but never achieve them, but the ITU requires firms to launch their first satellite within seven years of reserving the spectrum, then steadily make progress toward completing their launches within seven years after that. If they don't, they may have to scale back their intentions.

Those requirements could soon become a serious problem for both Guowang and Qianfan. Since they began launching their non-experimental satellites last year, the clock is now ticking, and the ITU rules state they will need to have sent 10 percent of their spacecraft into the sky by 2026.

Compared to Starlink, both constellations appear to be slow in making progress. Starlink launched its first batch of satellites in May 2019, and the company got into a steady rhythm the following year, reaching almost 2,000 satellites in about two years, says McDowell.

Guowang in particular has been moving slower than many observers expected since it first registered with the ITU in 2020. “Everybody, myself included, was expecting there to be a pretty quick ramp up, because they had a lot of money, they had a lot of support, and they had this government mandate” to become the Chinese Starlink, says Blaine Curcio, founder of Orbital Gateway Consulting, a market research firm that focuses on the Chinese space industry.

Guowang, or SatNet, as some have come to call it, was one of the first satellite companies that made a high-profile move into Xiong'an, a development near Beijing that the Chinese government has been promoting as a high-tech city of the future. But its ties to the government may have also led to bureaucratic hurdles, Curcio says. The company is led by executives from large state-owned enterprises, who likely bring with them a more traditional, top-down style of management. “They're just not going to move fast and break things,” he explains.

Although Qianfan also has state backing from Shanghai's municipal government, experts say it operates more like a modern business and has hired experienced executives from the finance and business sectors, which may be why it's been moving faster than Guowang.

But there's one serious bottleneck that's plaguing both projects right now: rocket availability. While China launches a large number of rockets annually, they have to be shared among various projects, including satellites for navigation and remote sensing. More importantly, China still doesn't have any operable reusable rockets yet, which have been essential for Starlink to maintain its fast and economical launch cadence.

Qianfan has put out two public procurement requests this year for rocket suppliers but declared them both failures because they didn't receive enough bidders. While there are several Chinese commercial companies working on developing reusable rockets, none are ready for prime time. “It's possible that in the next couple of years we'll start to see that that bottleneck get resolved, but it's also possible that it remains a pretty substantial bottleneck,” Curcios says.

Guowang and Qianfan appear to have avoided directly competing with one another so far by targeting different markets. Guowang, which has more central government support, could be tasked with use cases that have a national security element. Taiwan has reportedly received intelligence that China's military drills around the island have been seeking to validate whether Guowang works in the area and can direct Chinese missiles for potential strikes in the West Pacific, according to a report published by The Atlantic Council last month.

Qianfan, on the other hand, is positioning itself as a competitor to Starlink for the international market. A map Qianfan representatives presented at a space industry conference in China last year showed it's already working in six markets: Brazil, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan. The map also says it's planning to go into two dozen more in 2025, including countries like India, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Argentina, and many across Africa.

Qianfan may have an easier time winning over international markets as some countries become increasingly wary of Musk's political activities and influence over Starlink. In 2023, for instance, Musk made the decision to restrict Starlink service to Ukraine amid its war with Russia. Starlink's newer satellites are equipped with the ability to provide service to users without their data passing through any local internet gateways, which could also deter some countries who want more control of local internet data. “As I understand, Qianfan has chosen to not do this, as a way of giving countries more peace of mind with regard to landing traffic locally,” Curcio says.

Many telecom firms have also been frustrated with Starlink's decision to work with multiple competing local resellers at the same time. Measat, the Malaysia satellite communications company that signed a preliminary deal with Qianfan in February, was also one of Starlink's first resellers in the country, Curcio says. But Starlink later onboarded more of its competitors and also began offering its products to customers directly, which could have cut into Measat's profits.

Qianfan has not announced any direct-to-customer services and is instead providing only local telecom companies with satellite internet capabilities. “From a commercial angle, if you make a deal with Starlink, it's like making a deal with the devil. Eventually Starlink is going to go behind your back and try to take your customers from you and sell to them directly,” Curcio says.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","‘A Billion Streams and No Fans': Inside a $10 Million AI Music Fraud Case","https://www.wired.com/story/ai-bots-streaming-music/","Tue, 20 May 2025 10:04:02 GMT","

Almost no one hits it big in music. The odds are so bad it's criminal. But on a late spring evening in Louisville, Kentucky, Mike Smith and Jonathan Hay were having that rare golden moment when everything clicks. Smith was on guitar. Hay was fiddling with the drum machine and keyboard. Dudes were grooving. Holed up in Hay's living room, surrounded by chordophones and production gizmos, the two musicians were hoping that their first album as a jazz duo would finally win them the attention they'd been chasing for years.

It was 2017. The men, then in their forties, were longtime collaborators and business partners—though they made an odd couple. Smith owned a string of medical clinics and wore tight shirts over his meticulously maintained muscles. He lived in a sprawling house in the suburbs of Charlotte, North Carolina, with his wife and six kids. He'd judged on a reality TV show and written a self-help book. Hay—larger, softer, comfy in sweatsuits and Crocs—lived in an apartment and was dating a stripper. He loved weed. He'd hustled as a music publicist for years; by reputation he was best known in the industry for promoting a nuclear rumor that Rihanna had hooked up with Jay-Z. He'd recently, on an impulse, had sleeves tattooed on his arms. To avoid annoying his health-nut friend, he'd sneak into his bedroom to vape.

Michael Smith and Jonathan Hay were longtime collaborators and something of an odd couple.

Smith and Hay finished their album and called it Jazz. That fall, they released it on all the usual places—Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal—and as a physical album. Alas, it failed to take off. Smith and Hay weren't total nobodies; a few songs they had coproduced for other artists years earlier had gotten some buzz. So the two men decided to retool Jazz and release an updated version, adding new songs.

Jazz (Deluxe) came out in January 2018. Right away, it shot up the Billboard chart and hit No. 1. Hay was elated. At last, real, measurable success had arrived.

Then, just as suddenly, the album disappeared from the ranking. “Nobody drops off the next week to zero,” says Hay, remembering his confusion. He called other artists to ask if they'd ever seen this before. They hadn't. Questions piled up. If so many people had listened, why did they suddenly stop? He scanned the internet for chatter. Even a single freaking tweet would have been nice. Nada. Where were the fans? “No one's talking about the music,” Hay realized.

WIRED profiles the people who make trouble—scams, drug deals, even murder—and also, occasionally, save the day.

Pulling up Spotify's dashboard for artists, Hay scrutinized the analytics for the pair's work. Listeners appeared concentrated in far-flung places like Vietnam. Things only got stranger from there. Here's how Hay remembers it: He started receiving notices from distributors, the companies that handle the licensing of indie artists' music. The distributors were flagging Smith and Hay's music, from Jazz and from other projects, for streaming fraud and pulling it down. Smith told Hay it was a mistake and that Hay had messed up securing the proper rights for samples. Hay frantically tried to correct the issue, but the flagging persisted.

Hay, panicking, badgered Smith to help him figure out what was happening. Finally, Hay says, Smith offered some answers: Smith had instructed his staff at the medical clinics to stream their songs. It didn't sound like the full story.

Then, last September, Smith turned up at the heart of another music streaming incident, this one rather epic. The FBI arrested him and charged him in the first AI streaming fraud case in the United States. The government claims that between 2017 and 2024, Smith made over $10 million in royalties by using bot armies to continuously play AI-generated tracks on streaming platforms. Smith pleaded not guilty to all charges. (Through his lawyer, Smith declined to be interviewed, so this is very much Hay's side of the story, corroborated by numerous interviews with people who worked with the two men.)

When Hay found out, he marveled at the idea of his former collaborator managing to get richer than nearly all working musicians without being a household name. “He had a billion streams,” Hay claims, “and no fans.”

When he first met Smith in 2013, Hay was working as a publicist; to make extra cash, he sold online PR consulting to aspiring musicians at $250 a session. Smith came across those sessions and signed up. “He did something really grandiose,” Hay says. “He booked like 20 hours.” Ka-ching!

Smith flew in for his tutorial in person. Though Hay was the local, Smith picked the meeting spot, a sports bar in a strip mall. (“Control freak,” Hay says now.) The way Hay understood it, Smith had amassed a fortune running medical clinics. As his next act, Hay says, Smith wanted to get famous, and he was willing to spend whatever it took. By the end of the first consultation, he says, they were simpatico: Smith yearned to be a star, Hay a starmaker.

The two men quickly settled on a strategy. Although Smith wanted to be an artist himself, they'd start a label called SMH Records and work their way through the industry as producers and behind-the-scenes movers—basically, paying their way in. “Spared no expenses on the budget,” says B. Stille, one of the members of the southern rap group Nappy Roots, who worked with Smith and Hay a few times. One of the pair's first wins was coproducing a buzzy single for the group. Smith also financed, and became a judge on, BET's One Shot, where he scouted for rap's next stars alongside DJ Khaled, Twista, and T.I., despite the fact that they were all big-name hip-hop stars and he was a relatively unknown record producer with a checkbook.

Around the time Smith started working on One Shot, Hay began to suspect that his buddy's finances were not all in order. He and another SMH employee dug around to see what they could uncover about their colleague. In February 2015, Hay sent their business associates a 111-page document accusing Smith of financial mismanagement. Hay thought it was his “Jerry Maguire moment.” He was confident he'd convince at least one other person that something was deeply wrong.

But others saw their relationship with Smith differently. “Everybody stayed with Mike,” he says. “It made me feel really stupid.” People in their circle trusted Smith, it seemed. Kxng Crooked, a rapper who judged with Smith on One Shot, found him wholesome. “I flew out to his house and played with his kids,” the rapper says. Goldy Locks, a musician on the SMH label, says she'd had “a completely positive experience” working with Smith. “Out of all the labels that I've ever been on, Mike's the only one that's ever taken care of us.”

One Shot aired in 2016, lasting for a single season. It marked a high point in Smith's career—and a downturn for Hay. In 2017, two men broke into Hay's apartment and held him and his daughter at gunpoint. Smith came to check on him afterward. Hay appreciated the gesture, and his anger faded. That is, until their jazz album came out and Hay began to suspect Smith again.

In the late 2010s, Smith linked up with Alex Mitchell, the CEO of an AI song generator startup called Boomy. AI song generators, which allow people to “create” music by selecting or customizing prompts about what the tunes should sound like, now have millions of users but were then a niche product. Smith was, it must be said, ahead of the curve here—few people appreciated then how omnipresent AI would become in the music world. In the government's indictment, Mitchell fits the description of an unnamed, not-charged co-conspirator: Starting around 2018, a “Chief Executive Officer of an AI music company” provided Smith with “thousands of songs each week.”

“Keep in mind what we're doing musically here ...,” the CEO wrote, per the indictment. “This is not ‘music,' it's ‘instant music' ;).” Smith allegedly assigned the AI songs to fake artists. The songs had otherworldly, -dictionary-scraping names: “Zygophyceae,” “Zygophyllaceae,” “Zygopteraceae.” The fake artists were equally odd, with names such as “Calm Force,” “Calm Knuckles,” “Calms Scorching,” and “Calorie Event.”

According to the indictment, Smith uploaded the music onto streaming platforms and, with the help of contractors, created thousands of accounts. Using “small pieces of computer code” that he'd bought, Smith was able to “continuously” play the music on those accounts—essentially commanding a custom bot army to play his AI tracks nonstop. Those plays triggered royalty payments. In other words, Smith was—if the allegations are true—cementing his status as a master purveyor of AI slop. Indeed, the ranks of AI slopstars are filling up fast with the hustlers flooding Amazon with crappy robo-books and the schemers gobbling up websites and turning them into AI content mills. The internet has become a warehouse of algorithmically manufactured imitations of cultural products, all of it spewed into existence by people trying to game the faulty creator economy and get rich quick.

Hay says he knew nothing about AI at the time. But he believed something was up with their streaming numbers. The pair's fighting intensified. “You steal from streaming platforms,” he accused Smith via email in December 2019. “These are federal crimes, bro.” Smith responded by resending the pair's legal agreement. Hay claims that Smith cut him out of deals and withheld income—and it made him snap. Hay dashed off another jeremiad to their associates. He wrote to Billboard employees and other people in their professional network outlining his suspicions. This time, Hay says, he was ready to cut ties. He says he went to the local police and even the FBI: “I blew the whistle as loud as I could.”

But then—once again—nothing happened. A Billboard employee eventually texted Hay that the company had decided not to pursue an investigation. (Billboard declined to comment on this particular incident, though a spokesperson for Penske Media Corporation, which now owns and operates Billboard, noted that it will remove inaccurate records if it is made aware of the problem in a timely fashion. Billboard records from Smith and Hay still stand.) Embarrassed, Hay told the Billboard team that he had gone off his medication. He certainly felt crazy.

Smith, meanwhile, wasn't having a great time either. He was navigating a lawsuit from staffers at his medical offices, who claimed that his clinics had engaged in Medicaid and Medicare fraud. The lawsuit alleges that Smith was moving money from the clinics into SMH Records, which was something Hay had suspected. Smith and his codefendants reached a settlement in 2020, requiring them to pay $900,000.

Nevertheless, by 2022 Smith seemed to be back on a roll. He produced a song featuring Snoop Dogg and Billy Ray Cyrus. He was also lining up a slate of ambitious projects—including a horror movie with RZA and an animated series in which a cartoon Smith would travel to the afterlife, set to music by Snoop Dogg and RZA. (Neither Snoop Dogg nor RZA responded to requests for comment.) But success turns on a dime in this business, and by the following year something appeared to have changed. Smith went silent on Insta-gram. The horror movie came out without much fanfare. According to a timeline included in the criminal indictment, Smith was spending at least some of that time trying to convince groups within the streaming industry that he was legitimate. Then, in spring 2023, he received a notice that dealt a major blow. The Mechanical Licensing Collective, a nonprofit entity that collects and dispenses royalties for streaming services, had confronted Smith about fraud and was now halting payments. A crucial money spigot had turned off.

On September 4, 2024, federal agents pulled up to Smith's sprawling Colonial Revival–style brick home. They handcuffed him and perp-walked him out to their navy sprinter van, past his three-car garage, as befuddled neighbors looked on.

For Hay, the arrest was a vindication. In the indictment, Hay—who fits the description of an unnamed “Co-Conspirator 2” and is not charged with a crime—comes across as something of a patsy, the person whose work Smith used to “fraudulently generate royalty payments” before pivoting to AI. Other people in Smith's orbit have expressed surprise. Music promoter Bram Bessoff, who is registered as a cowriter on hundreds of Smith's AI songs, expressed “total shock” to WIRED and says he's cooperating with authorities. (While Bessoff is neither named nor charged in the indictment, “Co-Conspirator 4” is described as a music promoter.) Meanwhile, Boomy CEO Alex Mitchell, who was also registered on hundreds of the songs along with Bessoff and Smith, declined to respond to questions. A spokesperson for Boomy, Phoebe Myers, told WIRED that neither Mitchell nor Boomy “had any knowledge or involvement in Smith's alleged criminal conduct,” nor had they “engaged in bot streaming or knew of any bot streaming by Smith.” Myers adds that Mitchell did not have any relationship with Smith's music publishing company.

Included in the government's indictment is an excerpt from a jubilant email Smith sent to his co-conspirators (the ones who sound an awful lot like Mitchell and Bessoff). In it, he wrote about how they'd be receiving 10 percent cuts on the royalties generated by the songs: “We are at 88 million TOTAL STREAMS so far!!!”

Technically, it's not illegal to make a bonkers amount of AI-generated music and put it on a streaming service. Tacky, yes. Disrespectful to the art form, probably. But not necessarily against the law. In fact, it's pretty common: Deezer, a French music streaming platform, estimates that 10 percent of the songs uploaded every day are AI-generated. If a company were to train its song generator on copyrighted music without permission, it could run into trouble if music labels alleged that use case was illegal, as happened to Suno and Udio, two companies that are now the subject of lawsuits. Boomy appears to be aboveboard on this count—it has been certified by Fairly Trained, a nonprofit that checks whether generative AI companies got consent to use their training materials. So the first part of Smith's (alleged) scheme might, at most, be violating laws of good taste.

Then there are the bots and fake accounts. Major streaming services often prohibit their use in their terms of service. Last year, a man in Denmark was found guilty of committing music streaming fraud by using bots to play his music on Spotify and Apple Music. Still, the vast majority of such behavior goes unpunished. Morgan Hayduk, the co-CEO of a streaming-fraud-detection startup called Beatdapp, has monitored whole networks of bad actors siphoning money from streamers. “Conservatively, it's a billion-dollar-a-year type of problem,” Hayduk says. “The Michael Smith case is the tip of the iceberg.”

A 2021 study by France's National Music Center found that around 1 to 3 percent of all streams were fraudulent; Beatdapp puts that number at around 10 percent. According to Hayduk, some of the startup's clients consistently flag 17 to 25 percent of streams as fraudulent, and occasionally as many as half. As he sees it, AI song generators are a “supercharger” for this behavior, and Smith's alleged scheme isn't especially cutting-edge. “If you're a sophisticated, organized criminal,” Hayduk says, “you would do this from the comfort of a beach in a non-extradition country.”

It remains unclear which streaming companies ended up paying Smith the most money, probably because nobody wants to admit their detection efforts flopped. Spotify, the industry's behemoth, claims that its fraud detection programs caught Smith's alleged chicanery. “It appears our preventative measures worked and limited the royalties Smith was able to generate from Spotify to approximately $60,000 of the $10 million,” says Laura Batey, a company spokesperson. Apple, YouTube Music, and Tidal did not respond to questions; Amazon declined to answer questions about Smith. While distributors and streaming services are leaning on sophisticated fraud detection in an AI-versus-AI war, some industry experts argue that the real problem is the streaming companies' royalty payment structures and that only a total overhaul can curb the problem.

In some corners of the music world, Smith isn't seen as a villain. Musicians often accuse streaming platforms, and of course labels, of ripping off artists. Goldy Locks, Smith's former client, says some people view him as a modern-day Robin Hood. Others see him as a man who exploited an exploitative system, a creature native to a grift-addled environment. After all, radio invented payola, and Spotify inserts bulk-produced stock songs into popular playlists. The line between organic and paid audiences has always been blurry. Even in 19th-century France, “claqueurs” were paid to fill opera houses and clap.

Smith is now out on bail. His lawyer, Noell Tin, said in a statement that “Mike Smith is a successful songwriter, musical artist, devoted husband, and father to six children. He looks forward to responding to the charges against him in court.” The case, brought in the US Southern District Court of New York, will be heard by Judge John Koeltl, who has a history with consequential tech lawsuits, including a ruling against the Internet Archive and an ongoing case against the crypto hub Binance. If found guilty, Smith faces up to 60 years in prison. Either way, Smith has earned a seat in the music business pantheon: The government has cast him as an avatar for the AI era's gifts to grifters. Anybody can click a few buttons and make a song now. But building a fortune off these audienceless ditties? From one angle, it might be a crime. From another, it's a new art.

The new Gmail integration with more personalized, pre-written replies seems interesting! Last time I tested a generative AI tool in Gmail, it was still called Bard.

Google is talking about Personalized Smart Replies, which will be integrated into Gmail this summer. Gmail can take your personal history from Drive, Docs, Sheets, and other Google services, then use that info, paired with how you typically write, to send emails on your behalf. So if someone emails you asking for trip recommendations, it can generate all that for you, referencing your past itineraries, and send it off.

Soon, it will be bots just emailing bots.

In this short little demo of Project Astra built into Gemini on the phone—which is available on iOS and Android today—Google did a clever little inversion in which the human using it was hallucinating fake shit and the AI model was correcting the human. “Why does this person keep following me?” the person asked, pointing their phone at their shadow as they walked down the street. “That's your shadow,” the AI said.

AI will ruin reality before it ultimately proposes a solution to fix it.

Google showed off this “Gemini with Video” capability back at Mobile World Congress, where it rolled out to Samsung and Pixel phones, but now it's coming to all Android phones and iOS starting today. You can trigger the camera in Gemini Live to ask it anything you'd like about what's in front of you, powered by Google's Project Astra tech.

Finally getting some updates on Project Starline, which Lauren got a demo of a few years ago. It's now called Google Beam, and Google says it uses six cameras to convert 2D to 3D, making your video calls seem all the more lifelike, as if the person you're virtually talking to is right there in front of you. Google says it has near-perfect headtracking and does all of this at 60 frames per second. Google Beam will be available later this year, starting with HP. Expect to see it in your offices, what with all those RTO mandates.

Last year at I/O, Google announced how it was jamming generative AI into search by showing more people AI overviews (summaries) when they searched for things. It was a change to the world-search order, in which Google was deprioritizing links and, as I described it at the time, taking the index cards for the screenplay it had written for the past twenty-five years and throwing them to the wind.

This year, Google's going to be talking a lot about AI Mode, a tab within the native search app that is supposedly going to be more conversational and have a longer memory.

Reece Rogers

I'm a little confused as to what a “user” of AI Overviews means in this context. Does that count everyone who's using Search and seeing AI-generated answers at the top of results? It's not a feature users can opt-out from.

Amazon's autonomous vehicle unit Zoox is about to start testing its self-driving vehicles in Atlanta, Georgia, a precursor to eventually offering public rides in the city.

Zoox told TechCrunch on Tuesday that it has completed the “initial mapping phase” in Atlanta and will begin autonomous driving later this summer. 

Atlanta is the seventh city in the U.S. where Zoox is testing its vehicles. The company announced its testing plans just one day after Waymo — along with partner Uber — said it would start offering rides in its own robotaxis to early access users in Atlanta ahead of a larger public launch this summer.

Zoox is taking a methodical approach to the rollout of its promised robotaxi service. In Atlanta, as in other cities, the company used modified Toyota Highlanders to record things like the geometry of each road and the location of traffic lights. It's only after those steps that Zoox can start testing its autonomous vehicle technology in an area.

The company has progressed to testing its purpose-built robotaxi without a safety operator in California cities like Foster City and San Francisco, as well as in Las Vegas, Nevada. Zoox plans to offer public rides in the robotaxi in San Francisco and Las Vegas by the end of this year.

As part of that process, the company has been working out kinks in its autonomous vehicle technology. Zoox issued recalls in March and in May related to software updates meant to fix problems that its self-driving test fleet has encountered during testing.

This story has been updated to include information from Zoox that was not in its press release about how the company has already gathered mapping and other data in Atlanta.

Manus, the once-buzzy AI agent platform, on Tuesday launched a plan aimed at small businesses and organizations.  

The plan, dubbed Manus Team, starts at $39 per seat per month with a five-seat minimum, totaling $195 per month. Each team gets 19,500 credits in a sharable pool, as well as access to certain features in beta, dedicated infrastructure, and priority access during peak hours.

Manus Team is live!We're introducing team pricing for shared credits access to Manus. Your team gets 3,900 credits per seat in a flexible pool with no individual limits, and each member can run up to 2 tasks at the same time. Starts at 5 seats for $39/seat/month. pic.twitter.com/F9drbwEyCS

Credits can be spent on tasks — for example, copying data from a website to a spreadsheet. Lengthier tasks can burn up hundreds — or even thousands — of credits.

Team users can run up to two tasks concurrently and can optionally use Manus' “high-effort mode” for improved reliability.

Manus, which went viral in March in part thanks to a buzzy social media campaign, has introduced a number of premium offerings in recent weeks as well as a mobile app. The startup behind the platform, Butterfly Effect, reportedly recently raised $75 million in a funding round led by Benchmark that valued the company at $500 million.

According to Bloomberg, Manus aims to expand to new markets, including Japan and the Middle East. The company also intends to continue upgrading the AI models that power its platform. Currently, Manus primarily uses Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet and customized versions of Alibaba's Qwen.

AI software company Builder.ai is entering insolvency proceedings, a company spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch.  

The Microsoft-backed unicorn, which has raised more than $450 million in funding, rose to prominence for its AI-based platform that aimed to simplify the process of building apps and websites.

According to the spokesperson, Builder.ai, also known as Engineer.ai Corporation, is appointing an administrator to “manage the company's affairs.”

“Despite the tireless efforts of our current team and exploring every possible option, the business has been unable to recover from historic challenges and past decisions that placed significant strain on its financial position,” the company said in a statement. “Our immediate priority is to support our employees, customers, and partners through this difficult time. We will work closely with the appointed administrators to ensure an orderly process and to explore all available options for parts of the business, where possible.”

Builder.ai has faced major leadership shakeups and financial issues over the past few months. In March, it was reported that the company last summer lowered its estimated revenue by 25% for the second half of 2024. In February, the company appointed a new CEO, Manpreet Ratia.

Builder.ai hired auditors to study its financials, indicating that something may have been off behind the scenes. According to Bloomberg, former employees alleged that the company had inflated sales figures by more than 20% on multiple occasions.

Before Engineer.ai largely rebranded to Builder.ai, it attracted a minor scandal. Engineer.ai claimed to have built a largely automated app development platform, but the platform in truth relied heavily on human engineers, according to The Wall Street Journal.

People will then want to prove you wrong. 2.

One pattern that I have frequently used in EMACS elisp is that redefining a top-level value overwrites that value rather than shadowing it. Basically hot reloading. This doesn't work in a dependently typed context as the type of subsequent definitions can depend on values of earlier definitions.    def t := string
    def x: t := ""asdf""
    redef t := int

redefining t here would cause x to fail to type check. So the only options are to either shadow the variable t, or have redefinitions type-check all terms whose types depend on the value being redefined.Excluding the type-level debugging they mention, I think a lean style language-server is a better approach. Otherwise you are basically using an append-only ed to edit your environment rather than a vi.

The emissions from individual AI text, image, and video queries seem small—until you add up what the industry isn't tracking and consider where it's heading next.

AI's integration into our lives is the most significant shift in online life in more than a decade. Hundreds of millions of people now regularly turn to chatbots for help with homework, research, coding, or to create images and videos. But what's powering all of that?

Today, new analysis by MIT Technology Review provides an unprecedented and comprehensive look at how much energy the AI industry uses—down to a single query—to trace where its carbon footprint stands now, and where it's headed, as AI barrels towards billions of daily users.

This story is a part of MIT Technology Review's series “Power Hungry: AI and our energy future,” on the energy demands and carbon costs of the artificial-intelligence revolution.

We spoke to two dozen experts measuring AI's energy demands, evaluated different AI models and prompts, pored over hundreds of pages of projections and reports, and questioned top AI model makers about their plans. Ultimately, we found that the common understanding of AI's energy consumption is full of holes.

We started small, as the question of how much a single query costs is vitally important to understanding the bigger picture. That's because those queries are being built into ever more applications beyond standalone chatbots: from search, to agents, to the mundane daily apps we use to track our fitness, shop online, or book a flight. The energy resources required to power this artificial-intelligence revolution are staggering, and the world's biggest tech companies have made it a top priority to harness ever more of that energy, aiming to reshape our energy grids in the process.

Meta and Microsoft are working to fire up new nuclear power plants. OpenAI and President Donald Trump announced the Stargate initiative, which aims to spend $500 billion—more than the Apollo space program—to build as many as 10 data centers (each of which could require five gigawatts, more than the total power demand from the state of New Hampshire). Apple announced plans to spend $500 billion on manufacturing and data centers in the US over the next four years. Google expects to spend $75 billion on AI infrastructure alone in 2025.

This isn't simply the norm of a digital world. It's unique to AI, and a marked departure from Big Tech's electricity appetite in the recent past. From 2005 to 2017, the amount of electricity going to data centers remained quite flat thanks to increases in efficiency, despite the construction of armies of new data centers to serve the rise of cloud-based online services, from Facebook to Netflix. In 2017, AI began to change everything. Data centers started getting built with energy-intensive hardware designed for AI, which led them to double their electricity consumption by 2023. The latest reports show that 4.4% of all the energy in the US now goes toward data centers.

The carbon intensity of electricity used by data centers was 48% higher than the US average.

Given the direction AI is headed—more personalized, able to reason and solve complex problems on our behalf, and everywhere we look—it's likely that our AI footprint today is the smallest it will ever be. According to new projections published by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in December, by 2028 more than half of the electricity going to data centers will be used for AI. At that point, AI alone could consume as much electricity annually as 22% of all US households.

Meanwhile, data centers are expected to continue trending toward using dirtier, more carbon-intensive forms of energy (like gas) to fill immediate needs, leaving clouds of emissions in their wake. And all of this growth is for a new technology that's still finding its footing, and in many applications—education, medical advice, legal analysis—might be the wrong tool for the job or at least have a less energy-intensive alternative.

Tallies of AI's energy use often short-circuit the conversation—either by scolding individual behavior, or by triggering comparisons to bigger climate offenders. Both reactions dodge the point: AI is unavoidable, and even if a single query is low-impact, governments and companies are now shaping a much larger energy future around AI's needs.

We're taking a different approach with an accounting meant to inform the many decisions still ahead: where data centers go, what powers them, and how to make the growing toll of AI visible and accountable.

ChatGPT is now estimated to be the fifth-most visited website in the world, just after Instagram and ahead of X.

That's because despite the ambitious AI vision set forth by tech companies, utility providers, and the federal government, details of how this future might come about are murky. Scientists, federally funded research facilities, activists, and energy companies argue that leading AI companies and data center operators disclose too little about their activities. Companies building and deploying AI models are largely quiet when it comes to answering a central question: Just how much energy does interacting with one of these models use? And what sorts of energy sources will power AI's future?

This leaves even those whose job it is to predict energy demands forced to assemble a puzzle with countless missing pieces, making it nearly impossible to plan for AI's future impact on energy grids and emissions. Worse, the deals that utility companies make with the data centers will likely transfer the costs of the AI revolution to the rest of us, in the form of higher electricity bills.

It's a lot to take in. To describe the big picture of what that future looks like, we have to start at the beginning.

Before you can ask an AI model to help you with travel plans or generate a video, the model is born in a data center.

Racks of servers hum along for months, ingesting training data, crunching numbers, and performing computations. This is a time-consuming and expensive process—it's estimated that training OpenAI's GPT-4 took over $100 million and consumed 50 gigawatt-hours of energy, enough to power San Francisco for three days. It's only after this training, when consumers or customers “inference” the AI models to get answers or generate outputs, that model makers hope to recoup their massive costs and eventually turn a profit.

“For any company to make money out of a model—that only happens on inference,” says Esha Choukse, a researcher at Microsoft Azure who has studied how to make AI inference more efficient.

As conversations with experts and AI companies made clear, inference, not training, represents an increasing majority of AI's energy demands and will continue to do so in the near future. It's now estimated that 80–90% of computing power for AI is used for inference.

All this happens in data centers. There are roughly 3,000 such buildings across the United States that house servers and cooling systems and are run by cloud providers and tech giants like Amazon or Microsoft, but used by AI startups too. A growing number—though it's not clear exactly how many, since information on such facilities is guarded so tightly—are set up for AI inferencing.

At each of these centers, AI models are loaded onto clusters of servers containing special chips called graphics processing units, or GPUs, most notably a particular model made by Nvidia called the H100.

This chip started shipping in October 2022, just a month before ChatGPT launched to the public. Sales of H100s have soared since, and are part of why Nvidia regularly ranks as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.

Other chips include the A100 and the latest Blackwells. What all have in common is a significant energy requirement to run their advanced operations without overheating.

A single AI model might be housed on a dozen or so GPUs, and a large data center might have well over 10,000 of these chips connected together.

Wired close together with these chips are CPUs (chips that serve up information to the GPUs) and fans to keep everything cool.

Some energy is wasted at nearly every exchange through imperfect insulation materials and long cables in between racks of servers, and many buildings use millions of gallons of water (often fresh, potable water) per day in their cooling operations.

Depending on anticipated usage, these AI models are loaded onto hundreds or thousands of clusters in various data centers around the globe, each of which have different mixes of energy powering them.

They're then connected online, just waiting for you to ping them with a question.

If you've seen a few charts estimating the energy impact of putting a question to an AI model, you might think it's like measuring a car's fuel economy or a dishwasher's energy rating: a knowable value with a shared methodology for calculating it. You'd be wrong.

In reality, the type and size of the model, the type of output you're generating, and countless variables beyond your control—like which energy grid is connected to the data center your request is sent to and what time of day it's processed—can make one query thousands of times more energy-intensive and emissions-producing than another.

And when you query most AI models, whether on your phone within an app like Instagram or on the web interface for ChatGPT, much of what happens after your question is routed to a data center remains a secret. Factors like which data center in the world processes your request, how much energy it takes to do so, and how carbon-intensive the energy sources used are tend to be knowable only to the companies that run the models.

This is true for most of the name-brand models you're accustomed to, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude, which are referred to as “closed.” The key details are held closely by the companies that make them, guarded because they're viewed as trade secrets (and also possibly because they might result in bad PR). These companies face few incentives to release this information, and so far they have not.

“The closed AI model providers are serving up a total black box,” says Boris Gamazaychikov, head of AI sustainability at Salesforce, who has led efforts with researchers at Hugging Face, an AI platform provider of tools, models, and libraries for individuals and companies, to make AI's energy demands more transparent. Without more disclosure from companies, it's not just that we don't have good estimates—we have little to go on at all.

Without more disclosure from companies, it's not just that we don't have good estimates—we have little to go on at all.

So where can we turn for estimates? So-called open-source models can be downloaded and tweaked by researchers, who can access special tools to measure how much energy the H100 GPU requires for a given task. Such models are also incredibly popular; Meta announced in April that its Llama models have been downloaded more than 1.2 billion times, and many companies use open-source models when they want more control over outputs than they can get using something like ChatGPT.

But even if researchers can measure the power drawn by the GPU, that leaves out the power used up by CPUs, fans, and other equipment. A 2024 paper by Microsoft analyzed energy efficiencies for inferencing large language models and found that doubling the amount of energy used by the GPU gives an approximate estimate of the entire operation's energy demands.

So for now, measuring leading open-source models (and adding estimates for all these other pieces) gives us the best picture we have of just how much energy is being used for a single AI query. However, keep in mind that the ways people use AI today—to write a grocery list or create a surrealist video—are far simpler than the ones we'll use in the autonomous, agentic future that AI companies are hurling us toward. More on that later.

Here's what we found.

Let's start with models where you type a question and receive back a response in words. One of the leading groups evaluating the energy demands of AI is at the University of Michigan, led by PhD candidate Jae-Won Chung and associate professor Mosharaf Chowdhury. We worked with the team to focus on the energy demands of one of the most widely adopted open-source models, Meta's Llama.

The smallest model in our Llama cohort, Llama 3.1 8B, has 8 billion parameters—essentially the adjustable “knobs” in an AI model that allow it to make predictions. When tested on a variety of different text-generating prompts, like making a travel itinerary for Istanbul or explaining quantum computing, the model required about 57 joules per response, or an estimated 114 joules when accounting for cooling, other computations, and other demands. This is tiny—about what it takes to ride six feet on an e-bike, or run a microwave for one-tenth of a second.

The largest of our text-generation cohort, Llama 3.1 405B, has 50 times more parameters. More parameters generally means better answers but more energy required for each response. On average, this model needed 3,353 joules, or an estimated 6,706 joules total, for each response. That's enough to carry a person about 400 feet on an e-bike or run the microwave for eight seconds.

So model size is a huge predictor of energy demand. One reason is that once a model gets to a certain size, it has to be run on more chips, each of which adds to the energy required. The largest model we tested has 405 billion parameters, but others, such as DeepSeek, have gone much further, with over 600 billion parameters. The parameter counts for closed-source models are not publicly disclosed and can only be estimated. GPT-4 is estimated to have over 1 trillion parameters.

But in all these cases, the prompt itself was a huge factor too. Simple prompts, like a request to tell a few jokes, frequently used nine times less energy than more complicated prompts to write creative stories or recipe ideas.

AI models that generate images and videos work with a different architecture, called diffusion. Rather than predicting and generating words, they learn how to transform an image of noise into, let's say, a photo of an elephant. They do this by learning the contours and patterns of pictures in their training data and storing this information across millions or billions of parameters. Video-generator models learn how to do this across the dimension of time as well.

The energy required by a given diffusion model doesn't depend on your prompt—generating an image of a skier on sand dunes requires the same amount of energy as generating one of an astronaut farming on Mars. The energy requirement instead depends on the size of the model, the image resolution, and the number of “steps” the diffusion process takes (more steps lead to higher quality but need more energy).

Generating a standard-quality image (1024 x 1024 pixels) with Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, the leading open-source image generator, with 2 billion parameters, requires about 1,141 joules of GPU energy. With diffusion models, unlike large language models, there are no estimates of how much GPUs are responsible for the total energy required, but experts suggested we stick with the “doubling” approach we've used thus far because the differences are likely subtle. That means an estimated 2,282 joules total. Improving the image quality by doubling the number diffusion steps to 50 just about doubles the energy required, to about 4,402 joules. That's equivalent to about 250 feet on an e-bike, or around five and a half seconds running a microwave. That's still less than the largest text model.

This might be surprising if you imagined generating images to require more energy than generating text. “Large [text] models have a lot of parameters,” says Chung, who performed the measurements on open-source text and image generators featured in this story. “Even though they are generating text, they are doing a lot of work. ” Image generators, on the other hand, often work with fewer parameters.

Videos generated by CogVideoX, an open-source model.

Last year, OpenAI debuted Sora, its dazzling tool for making high-fidelity videos with AI. Other closed-source video models have come out as well, like Google Veo2 and Adobe's Firefly.

Given the eye-watering amounts of capital and content it takes to train these models, it's no surprise that free-to-use, open-source models generally lag behind in quality. Still, according to researchers at Hugging Face, one of the best is CogVideoX, made by a Chinese AI startup called Zhipu AI and researchers from Tsinghua University in Beijing.

Sasha Luccioni, an AI and climate researcher at Hugging Face, tested the energy required to generate videos with the model using a tool called Code Carbon.

An older version of the model, released in August, made videos at just eight frames per second at a grainy resolution—more like a GIF than a video. Each one required about 109,000 joules to produce. But three months later the company launched a larger, higher-quality model that produces five-second videos at 16 frames per second (this frame rate still isn't high definition; it's the one used in Hollywood's silent era until the late 1920s). The new model uses more than 30 times more energy on each 5-second video: about 3.4 million joules, more than 700 times the energy required to generate a high-quality image. This is equivalent to riding 38 miles on an e-bike, or running a microwave for over an hour.

It's fair to say that the leading AI video generators, creating dazzling and hyperrealistic videos up to 30 seconds long, will use significantly more energy. As these generators get larger, they're also adding features that allow you to tweak particular elements of videos and stitch multiple shots together into scenes—all of which add to their energy demands. A note: AI companies have defended these numbers saying that generative video has a smaller footprint than the film shoots and travel that go into typical video production. That claim is hard to test and doesn't account for the surge in video generation that might follow if AI videos become cheap to produce.

So what might a day's energy consumption look like for one person with an AI habit?

Let's say you're running a marathon as a charity runner and organizing a fundraiser to support your cause. You ask an AI model 15 questions about the best way to fundraise.

Then you make 10 attempts at an image for your flyer before you get one you are happy with, and three attempts at a five-second video to post on Instagram.

You'd use about 2.9 kilowatt-hours of electricity—enough to ride over 100 miles on an e-bike (or around 10 miles in the average electric vehicle) or run the microwave for over three and a half hours.

There is a significant caveat to this math. These numbers cannot serve as a proxy for how much energy is required to power something like ChatGPT 4o. We don't know how many parameters are in OpenAI's newest models, how many of those parameters are used for different model architectures, or which data centers are used and how OpenAI may distribute requests across all these systems. You can guess, as many have done, but those guesses are so approximate that they may be more distracting than helpful.

“We should stop trying to reverse-engineer numbers based on hearsay,” Luccioni says, “and put more pressure on these companies to actually share the real ones.” Luccioni has created the AI Energy Score, a way to rate models on their energy efficiency. But closed-source companies have to opt in. Few have, Luccioni says.

Now that we have an estimate of the total energy required to run an AI model to produce text, images, and videos, we can work out what that means in terms of emissions that cause climate change.

First, a data center humming away isn't necessarily a bad thing. If all data centers were hooked up to solar panels and ran only when the sun was shining, the world would be talking a lot less about AI's energy consumption. That's not the case. Most electrical grids around the world are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels. So electricity use comes with a climate toll attached.

“AI data centers need constant power, 24-7, 365 days a year,” says Rahul Mewawalla, the CEO of Mawson Infrastructure Group, which builds and maintains high-energy data centers that support AI.

That means data centers can't rely on intermittent technologies like wind and solar power, and on average, they tend to use dirtier electricity. One preprint study from Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that the carbon intensity of electricity used by data centers was 48% higher than the US average. Part of the reason is that data centers currently happen to be clustered in places that have dirtier grids on average, like the coal-heavy grid in the mid-Atlantic region that includes Virginia, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. They also run constantly, including when cleaner sources may not be available.

Data centers can't rely on intermittent technologies like wind and solar power, and on average, they tend to use dirtier electricity.

Tech companies like Meta, Amazon, and Google have responded to this fossil fuel issue by announcing goals to use more nuclear power. Those three have joined a pledge to triple the world's nuclear capacity by 2050. But today, nuclear energy only accounts for 20% of electricity supply in the US, and powers a fraction of AI data centers' operations—natural gas accounts for more than half of electricity generated in Virginia, which has more data centers than any other US state, for example. What's more, new nuclear operations will take years, perhaps decades, to materialize.

In 2024, fossil fuels including natural gas and coal made up just under  60% of electricity supply in the US.  Nuclear accounted for about 20%, and a mix of renewables accounted for most of the remaining 20%.

Gaps in power supply, combined with the rush to build data centers to power AI, often mean shortsighted energy plans. In April, Elon Musk's X supercomputing center near Memphis was found, via satellite imagery, to be using dozens of methane gas generators that the Southern Environmental Law Center alleges are not approved by energy regulators to supplement grid power and are violating the Clean Air Act.

The key metric used to quantify the emissions from these data centers is called the carbon intensity: how many grams of carbon dioxide emissions are produced for each kilowatt-hour of electricity consumed. Nailing down the carbon intensity of a given grid requires understanding the emissions produced by each individual power plant in operation, along with the amount of energy each is contributing to the grid at any given time. Utilities, government agencies, and researchers use estimates of average emissions, as well as real-time measurements, to track pollution from power plants.

This intensity varies widely across regions. The US grid is fragmented, and the mixes of coal, gas, renewables, or nuclear vary widely. California's grid is far cleaner than West Virginia's, for example.

Time of day matters too. For instance, data from April 2024 shows that California's grid can swing from under 70 grams per kilowatt-hour in the afternoon when there's a lot of solar power available to over 300 grams per kilowatt-hour in the middle of the night.

This variability means that the same activity may have very different climate impacts, depending on your location and the time you make a request. Take that charity marathon runner, for example. The text, image, and video responses they requested add up to 2.9 kilowatt-hours of electricity. In California, generating that amount of electricity would produce about 650 grams of carbon dioxide pollution on average. But generating that electricity in West Virginia might inflate the total to more than 1,150 grams.

What we've seen so far is that the energy required to respond to a query can be relatively small, but it can vary a lot, depending on the type of query and the model being used. The emissions associated with that given amount of electricity will also depend on where and when a query is handled. But what does this all add up to?

ChatGPT is now estimated to be the fifth-most visited website in the world, just after Instagram and ahead of X. In December, OpenAI said that ChatGPT receives 1 billion messages every day, and after the company launched a new image generator in March, it said that people were using it to generate 78 million images per day, from Studio Ghibli–style portraits to pictures of themselves as Barbie dolls.

Given the direction AI is headed—more personalized, able to reason and solve complex problems on our behalf, and everywhere we look—it's likely that our AI footprint today is the smallest it will ever be.

One can do some very rough math to estimate the energy impact. In February the AI research firm Epoch AI published an estimate of how much energy is used for a single ChatGPT query—an estimate that, as discussed, makes lots of assumptions that can't be verified. Still, they calculated about 0.3 watt-hours, or 1,080 joules, per message. This falls in between our estimates for the smallest and largest Meta Llama models (and experts we consulted say that if anything, the real number is likely higher, not lower).

One billion of these every day for a year would mean over 109 gigawatt-hours of electricity, enough to power 10,400 US homes for a year. If we add images and imagine that generating each one requires as much energy as it does with our high-quality image models, it'd mean an additional 35 gigawatt-hours, enough to power another 3,300 homes for a year. This is on top of the energy demands of OpenAI's other products, like video generators, and that for all the other AI companies and startups.

But here's the problem: These estimates don't capture the near future of how we'll use AI. In that future, we won't simply ping AI models with a question or two throughout the day, or have them generate a photo. Instead, leading labs are racing us toward a world where AI “agents” perform tasks for us without our supervising their every move. We will speak to models in voice mode, chat with companions for 2 hours a day, and point our phone cameras at our surroundings in video mode. We will give complex tasks to so-called “reasoning models” that work through tasks logically but have been found to require 43 times more energy for simple problems, or “deep research” models that spend hours creating reports for us. We will have AI models that are “personalized” by training on our data and preferences.

This future is around the corner: OpenAI will reportedly offer agents for $20,000 per month and will use reasoning capabilities in all of its models moving forward, and DeepSeek catapulted “chain of thought” reasoning into the mainstream with a model that often generates nine pages of text for each response. AI models are being added to everything from customer service phone lines to doctor's offices, rapidly increasing AI's share of national energy consumption.

“The precious few numbers that we have may shed a tiny sliver of light on where we stand right now, but all bets are off in the coming years,” says Luccioni.

Every researcher we spoke to said that we cannot understand the energy demands of this future by simply extrapolating from the energy used in AI queries today. And indeed, the moves by leading AI companies to fire up nuclear power plants and create data centers of unprecedented scale suggest that their vision for the future would consume far more energy than even a large number of these individual queries.

“The precious few numbers that we have may shed a tiny sliver of light on where we stand right now, but all bets are off in the coming years,” says Luccioni. “Generative AI tools are getting practically shoved down our throats and it's getting harder and harder to opt out, or to make informed choices when it comes to energy and climate.”

To understand how much power this AI revolution will need, and where it will come from, we have to read between the lines.

A report published in December by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which is funded by the Department of Energy and has produced 16 Nobel Prizes, attempted to measure what AI's proliferation might mean for energy demand.

In analyzing both public and proprietary data about data centers as a whole, as well as the specific needs of AI, the researchers came to a clear conclusion. Data centers in the US used somewhere around 200 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, roughly what it takes to power Thailand for a year. AI-specific servers in these data centers are estimated to have used between 53 and 76 terawatt-hours of electricity. On the high end, this is enough to power more than 7.2 million US homes for a year.

If we imagine the bulk of that was used for inference, it means enough electricity was used on AI in the US last year for every person on Earth to have exchanged more than 4,000 messages with chatbots. In reality, of course, average individual users aren't responsible for all this power demand. Much of it is likely going toward startups and tech giants testing their models, power users exploring every new feature, and energy-heavy tasks like generating videos or avatars.

Data centers in the US used somewhere around 200 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, roughly what it takes to power Thailand for a year.

By 2028, the researchers estimate, the power going to AI-specific purposes will rise to between 165 and 326 terawatt-hours per year. That's more than all electricity currently used by US data centers for all purposes; it's enough to power 22% of US households each year. That could generate the same emissions as driving over 300 billion miles—over 1,600 round trips to the sun from Earth.

The researchers were clear that adoption of AI and the accelerated server technologies that power it has been the primary force causing electricity demand from data centers to skyrocket after remaining stagnant for over a decade. Between 2024 and 2028, the share of US electricity going to data centers may triple, from its current 4.4% to 12%.

This unprecedented surge in power demand for AI is in line with what leading companies are announcing. SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle, and the Emirati investment firm MGX intend to spend $500 billion in the next four years on new data centers in the US. The first has started construction in Abilene, Texas, and includes eight buildings that are each the size of a baseball stadium. In response to a White House request for information, Anthropic suggested that the US build an additional 50 gigawatts of dedicated power by 2027.

AI companies are also planning multi-gigawatt constructions abroad, including in Malaysia, which is becoming Southeast Asia's data center hub. In May OpenAI announced a plan to support data-center buildouts abroad as part of a bid to “spread democratic AI.” Companies are taking a scattershot approach to getting there—inking deals for new nuclear plants, firing up old ones, and striking massive deals with utility companies.

MIT Technology Review sought interviews with Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft about their plans for this future, and for specific figures on the energy required to inference leading AI models. OpenAI declined to provide figures or make anyone available for an interview but provided a statement saying that it prioritizes efficient use of computing resources and collaborates with partners to support sustainability goals, and that AI might help discover climate solutions. The company said early sites for its Stargate initiative will be natural gas and solar powered and that the company will look to include nuclear and geothermal wherever possible.

Microsoft discussed its own research on improving AI efficiencies but declined to share specifics of how these approaches are incorporated into its data centers.

Google declined to share numbers detailing how much energy is required at inference time for its AI models like Gemini and features like AI Overviews. The company pointed to information about its TPUs—Google's proprietary equivalent of GPUs—and the efficiencies they've gained.

The Lawrence Berkeley researchers offered a blunt critique of where things stand, saying that the information disclosed by tech companies, data center operators, utility companies, and hardware manufacturers is simply not enough to make reasonable projections about the unprecedented energy demands of this future or estimate the emissions it will create. They offered ways that companies could disclose more information without violating trade secrets, such as anonymized data-sharing arrangements, but their report acknowledged that the architects of this massive surge in AI data centers have thus far not been transparent, leaving them without the tools to make a plan.

“Along with limiting the scope of this report, this lack of transparency highlights that data center growth is occurring with little consideration for how best to integrate these emergent loads with the expansion of electricity generation/transmission or for broader community development,” they wrote. The authors also noted that only two other reports of this kind have been released in the last 20 years.

We heard from several other researchers who say that their ability to understand the emissions and energy demands of AI are hampered by the fact that AI is not yet treated as its own sector. The US Energy Information Administration, for example, makes projections and measurements for manufacturing, mining, construction, and agriculture, but detailed data about AI is simply nonexistent.

“Why should we be paying for this infrastructure? Why should we be paying for their power bills?”

Individuals may end up footing some of the bill for this AI revolution, according to new research published in March. The researchers, from Harvard's Electricity Law Initiative, analyzed agreements between utility companies and tech giants like Meta that govern how much those companies will pay for power in massive new data centers. They found that discounts utility companies give to Big Tech can raise the electricity rates paid by consumers. In some cases, if certain data centers fail to attract the promised AI business or need less power than expected, ratepayers could still be on the hook for subsidizing them. A 2024 report from the Virginia legislature estimated that average residential ratepayers in the state could pay an additional $37.50 every month in data center energy costs.

“It's not clear to us that the benefits of these data centers outweigh these costs,” says Eliza Martin, a legal fellow at the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard and a coauthor of the research. “Why should we be paying for this infrastructure? Why should we be paying for their power bills?”

When you ask an AI model to write you a joke or generate a video of a puppy, that query comes with a small but measurable energy toll and an associated amount of emissions spewed into the atmosphere. Given that each individual request often uses less energy than running a kitchen appliance for a few moments, it may seem insignificant.

But as more of us turn to AI tools, these impacts start to add up. And increasingly, you don't need to go looking to use AI: It's being integrated into every corner of our digital lives.

Crucially, there's a lot we don't know; tech giants are largely keeping quiet about the details. But to judge from our estimates, it's clear that AI is a force reshaping not just technology but the power grid and the world around us.

We owe a special thanks to Jae-Won Chung, Mosharaf Chowdhury, and Sasha Luccioni, who shared their measurements of AI's energy use for this project.

The rising energy cost of data centers is a vital test case for how we deal with the broader electrification of the economy.

With seemingly no limit to the demand for artificial intelligence, everyone in the energy, AI, and climate fields is justifiably worried. Will there be enough clean electricity to power AI and enough water to cool the data centers that support this technology? These are important questions with serious implications for communities, the economy, and the environment. 

This story is a part of MIT Technology Review's series “Power Hungry: AI and our energy future,” on the energy demands and carbon costs of the artificial-intelligence revolution.

But the question about AI's energy usage portends even bigger issues about what we need to do in addressing climate change for the next several decades. If we can't work out how to handle this, we won't be able to handle broader electrification of the economy, and the climate risks we face will increase.

Innovation in IT got us to this point. Graphics processing units (GPUs) that power the computing behind AI have fallen in cost by 99% since 2006. There was similar concern about the energy use of data centers in the early 2010s, with wild projections of growth in electricity demand. But gains in computing power and energy efficiency not only proved these projections wrong but enabled a 550% increase in global computing capability from 2010 to 2018 with only minimal increases in energy use. 

In the late 2010s, however, the trends that had saved us began to break. As the accuracy of AI models dramatically improved, the electricity needed for data centers also started increasing faster; they now account for 4.4% of total demand, up  from 1.9% in 2018. Data centers consume more than 10% of the electricity supply in six US states. In Virginia, which has emerged as a hub of data center activity, that figure is 25%.

Projections about the future demand for energy to power AI are uncertain and range widely, but in one study, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimated that data centers could represent 6% to 12% of total US electricity use by 2028. Communities and companies will notice this type of rapid growth in electricity demand. It will put pressure on energy prices and on ecosystems.The projections have resulted in calls to build lots of new fossil-fired power plants or bring older ones out of retirement. In many parts of the US, the demand will likely result in a surge of natural-gas-powered plants.

It's a daunting situation. Yet when we zoom out, the projected electricity use from AI is still pretty small. The US generated about 4,300 billion kilowatt-hours last year. We'll likely need another 1,000 billion to 1,200 billion or more in the next decade—a 24% to 29% increase. Almost half the additional electricity demand will be from electrified vehicles. Another 30% is expected to be from electrified technologies in buildings and industry. Innovation in vehicle and building electrification also advanced in the last decade, and this shift will be good news for the climate, for communities, and for energy costs.

The remaining 22% of new electricity demand is estimated to come from AI and data centers. While it represents a smaller piece of the pie, it's the most urgent one. Because of their rapid growth and geographic concentration, data centers are the electrification challenge we face right now—the small stuff we have to figure out before we're able to do the big stuff like vehicles and buildings.

We also need to understand what the energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with AI are buying us. While the impacts from producing semiconductors and powering AI data centers are important, they are likely small compared with the positive or negative effects AI may have on applications such as the electricity grid, the transportation system, buildings and factories, or consumer behavior. Companies could use AI to develop new materials or batteries that would better integrate renewable energy into the grid. But they could also use AI to make it easier to find more fossil fuels. The claims about potential benefits for the climate are exciting, but they need to be continuously verified and will need support to be realized.

This isn't the first time we've faced challenges coping with growth in electricity demand. In the 1960s, US electricity demand was growing at more than 7% per year. In the 1970s that growth was nearly 5%, and in the 1980s and 1990s it was more than 2% per year. Then, starting in 2005, we basically had a decade and a half of flat electricity growth. Most projections for the next decade put our expected growth in electricity demand at around 2% again—but this time we'll have to do things differently. 

To manage these new energy demands, we need a “Grid New Deal” that leverages public and private capital to rebuild the electricity system for AI with enough capacity and intelligence for decarbonization. New clean energy supplies, investment in transmission and distribution, and strategies for virtual demand management can cut emissions, lower prices, and increase resilience. Data centers bringing clean electricity and distribution system upgrades could be given a fast lane to connect to the grid. Infrastructure banks could fund new transmission lines or pay to upgrade existing ones. Direct investment or tax incentives could encourage clean computing standards, workforce development in the clean energy sector, and open data transparency from data center operators about their energy use so that communities can understand and measure the impacts.

In 2022, the White House released a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights that provided principles to protect the public's rights, opportunities, and access to critical resources from being restricted by AI systems. To the AI Bill of Rights, we humbly offer a climate amendment, because ethical AI must be climate-safe AI. It's a starting point to ensure that the growth of AI works for everyone—that it doesn't raise people's energy bills, adds more clean power to the grid than it uses, increases investment in the power system's infrastructure, and benefits communities while driving innovation.

By grounding the conversation about AI and energy in context about what is needed to tackle climate change, we can deliver better outcomes for communities, ecosystems, and the economy. The growth of electricity demand for AI and data centers is a test case for how society will respond to the demands and challenges of broader electrification. If we get this wrong, the likelihood of meeting our climate targets will be extremely low. This is what we mean when we say the energy and climate impacts from data centers are small, but they are also huge.

Here's how MIT Technology Review waded through a mess of data and hidden variables to calculate the individual and collective energy demand from AI.

When we set out to write a story on the best available estimates for AI's energy and emissions burden, we knew there would be caveats and uncertainties to these numbers. But, we quickly discovered, the caveats are the story too. 

This story is a part of MIT Technology Review's series “Power Hungry: AI and our energy future,” on the energy demands and carbon costs of the artificial-intelligence revolution.

Measuring the energy used by an AI model is not like evaluating a car's fuel economy or an appliance's energy rating. There's no agreed-upon method or public database of values. There are no regulators who enforce standards, and consumers don't get the chance to evaluate one model against another. 

Despite the fact that billions of dollars are being poured into reshaping energy infrastructure around the needs of AI, no one has settled on a way to quantify AI's energy usage. Worse, companies are generally unwilling to disclose their own piece of the puzzle. There are also limitations to estimating the emissions associated with that energy demand, because the grid hosts a complicated, ever-changing mix of energy sources. 

It's a big mess, basically. So, that said, here are the many variables, assumptions, and caveats that we used to calculate the consequences of an AI query. (You can see the full results of our investigation here.)

Companies like OpenAI, dealing in “closed-source” models, generally offer access to their  systems through an interface where you input a question and receive an answer. What happens in between—which data center in the world processes your request, the energy it takes to do so, and the carbon intensity of the energy sources used—remains a secret, knowable only to the companies. There are few incentives for them to release this information, and so far, most have not.

That's why, for our analysis, we looked at open-source models. They serve as a very imperfect proxy but the best one we have. (OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google declined to share specifics on how much energy their closed-source models use.) 

The best resources for measuring the energy consumption of open-source AI models are AI Energy Score, ML.Energy, and MLPerf Power. The team behind ML.Energy assisted us with our text and image model calculations, and the team behind AI Energy Score helped with our video model calculations.

AI models use up energy in two phases: when they initially learn from vast amounts of data, called training, and when they respond to queries, called inference. When ChatGPT was launched a few years ago, training was the focus, as tech companies raced to keep up and build ever-bigger models. But now, inference is where the most energy is used.

The most accurate way to understand how much energy an AI model uses in the inference stage is to directly measure the amount of electricity used by the server handling the request. Servers contain all sorts of components—powerful chips called GPUs that do the bulk of the computing, other chips called CPUs, fans to keep everything cool, and more. Researchers typically measure the amount of power the GPU draws and estimate the rest (more on this shortly). 

To do this, we turned to PhD candidate Jae-Won Chung and associate professor Mosharaf Chowdhury at the University of Michigan, who lead the ML.Energy project. Once we collected figures for different models' GPU energy use from their team, we had to estimate how much energy is used for other processes, like cooling. We examined research literature, including a 2024 paper from Microsoft, to understand how much of a server's total energy demand GPUs are responsible for. It turns out to be about half. So we took the team's GPU energy estimate and doubled it to get a sense of total energy demands. 

The ML.Energy team uses a batch of 500 prompts from a larger dataset to test models. The hardware is kept the same throughout; the GPU is a popular Nvidia chip called the H100. We decided to focus on models of three sizes from the Meta Llama family: small (8 billion parameters), medium (70 billion), and large (405 billion). We also identified a selection of prompts to test. We compared these with the averages for the entire batch of 500 prompts. 

Stable Diffusion 3 from Stability AI is one of the most commonly used open-source image-generating models, so we made it our focus. Though we tested multiple sizes of the text-based Meta Llama model, we focused on one of the most popular sizes of Stable Diffusion 3, with 2 billion parameters. 

The team uses a dataset of example prompts to test a model's energy requirements. Though the energy used by large language models is determined partially by the prompt, this isn't true for diffusion models. Diffusion models can be programmed to go through a prescribed number of “denoising steps” when they generate an image or video, with each step being an iteration of the algorithm that adds more detail to the image. For a given step count and model, all images generated have the same energy footprint.

The more steps, the higher quality the end result—but the more energy used. Numbers of steps vary by model and application, but 25 is pretty common, and that's what we used for our standard quality. For higher quality, we used 50 steps. 

We mentioned that GPUs are usually responsible for about half of the energy demands of large language model requests. There is not sufficient research to know how this changes for diffusion models that generate images and videos. In the absence of a better estimate, and after consulting with researchers, we opted to stick with this 50% rule of thumb for images and videos too.

Chung and Chowdhury do test video models, but only ones that generate short, low-quality GIFs. We don't think the videos these models produce mirror the fidelity of the AI-generated video that many people are used to seeing. 

Instead, we turned to Sasha Luccioni, the AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, who directs the AI Energy Score project. She measures the energy used by the GPU during AI requests. We chose two versions of the CogVideoX model to test: an older, lower-quality version and a newer, higher-quality one. 

We asked Luccioni to use her tool, called Code Carbon, to test both and measure the results of a batch of video prompts we selected, using the same hardware as our text and image tests to keep as many variables as possible the same. She reported the GPU energy demands, which we again doubled to estimate total energy demands. 

After we understand how much energy it takes to respond to a query, we can translate that into the total emissions impact. Doing so requires looking at the power grid from which data centers draw their electricity. 

Nailing down the climate impact of the grid can be complicated, because it's both interconnected and incredibly local. Imagine the grid as a system of connected canals and pools of water. Power plants add water to the canals, and electricity users, or loads, siphon it out. In the US, grid interconnections stretch all the way across the country. So, in a way, we're all connected, but we can also break the grid up into its component pieces to get a sense for how energy sources vary across the country. 

The key metric to understand here is called carbon intensity, which is basically a measure of how many grams of carbon dioxide pollution are released for every kilowatt-hour of electricity that's produced. 

To get carbon intensity figures, we reached out to Electricity Maps, a Danish startup company that gathers data on grids around the world. The team collects information from sources including governments and utilities and uses them to publish historical and real-time estimates of the carbon intensity of the grid. You can find more about their methodology here. 

The company shared with us historical data from 2024, both for the entire US and for a few key balancing authorities (more on this in a moment). After discussions with Electricity Maps founder Olivier Corradi and other experts, we made a few decisions about which figures we would use in our calculations. 

One way to measure carbon intensity is to simply look at all the power plants that are operating on the grid, add up the pollution they're producing at the moment, and divide that total by the electricity they're producing. But that doesn't account for the emissions that are associated with building and tearing down power plants, which can be significant. So we chose to use carbon intensity figures that account for the whole life cycle of a power plant. 

We also chose to use the consumption-based carbon intensity of energy rather than production-based. This figure accounts for imports and exports moving between different parts of the grid and best represents the electricity that's being used, in real time, within a given region. 

For most of the calculations you see in the story, we used the average carbon intensity for the US for 2024, according to Electricity Maps, which is 402.49 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour. 

While understanding the picture across the entire US can be helpful, the grid can look incredibly different in different locations. 

One way we can break things up is by looking at balancing authorities. These are independent bodies responsible for grid balancing in a specific region. They operate mostly independently, though there's a constant movement of electricity between them as well. There are 66 balancing authorities in the US, and we can calculate a carbon intensity for the part of the grid encompassed by a specific balancing authority.

Electricity Maps provided carbon intensity figures for a few key balancing authorities, and we focused on several that play the largest roles in data center operations. ERCOT (which covers most of Texas) and PJM (a cluster of states on the East Coast, including Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey) are two of the regions with the largest burden of data centers, according to research from the Harvard School of Public Health. 

We added CAISO (in California) because it covers the most populated state in the US. CAISO also manages a grid with a significant number of renewable energy sources, making it a good example of how carbon intensity can change drastically depending on the time of day. (In the middle of the day, solar tends to dominate, while natural gas plays a larger role overnight, for example.)

One key caveat here is that we're not entirely sure where companies tend to send individual AI inference requests. There are clusters of data centers in the regions we chose as examples, but when you use a tech giant's AI model, your request could be handled by any number of data centers owned or contracted by the company. One reasonable approximation is location: It's likely that the data center servicing a request is close to where it's being made, so a request on the West Coast might be most likely to be routed to a data center on that side of the country. 

To better contextualize our calculations, we introduced a few comparisons people might be more familiar with than kilowatt-hours and grams of carbon dioxide. In a few places, we took the amount of electricity estimated to be used by a model and calculated how long that electricity would be able to power a standard microwave, as well as how far it might take someone on an e-bike. 

In the case of the e-bike, we assumed an efficiency of 25 watt-hours per mile, which falls in the range of frequently cited efficiencies for a pedal-assisted bike. For the microwave, we assumed an 800-watt model, which falls within the average range in the US. 

We also introduced a comparison to contextualize greenhouse gas emissions: miles driven in a gas-powered car. For this, we used data from the US Environmental Protection Agency, which puts the weighted average fuel economy of vehicles in the US in 2022 at 393 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per mile. 

After measuring the energy demand of an individual query and the emissions it generated, it was time to estimate how all of this added up to national demand. 

There are two ways to do this. In a bottom-up analysis, you estimate how many individual queries there are, calculate the energy demands of each, and add them up to determine the total. For a top-down look, you estimate how much energy all data centers are using by looking at larger trends. 

Bottom-up is particularly difficult, because, once again, closed-source companies do not share such information and declined to talk specifics with us. While we can make some educated guesses to give us a picture of what might be happening right now, looking into the future is perhaps better served by taking a top-down approach.

This data is scarce as well. The most important report was published in December by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which is funded by the Department of Energy, and the report authors noted that it's only the third such report released in the last 20 years. Academic climate and energy researchers we spoke with said it's a major problem that AI is not considered its own economic sector for emissions measurements, and there aren't rigorous reporting requirements. As a result, it's difficult to track AI's climate toll. 

Still, we examined the report's results, compared them with other findings and estimates, and consulted independent experts about the data. While much of the report was about data centers more broadly, we drew out data points that were specific to the future of AI. 

We wanted to contrast these figures with the amounts of energy that AI companies themselves say they need. To do so, we collected reports by leading tech and AI companies about their plans for energy and data center expansions, as well as the dollar amounts they promised to invest. Where possible, we fact-checked the promises made in these claims. (Meta and Microsoft's pledges to use more nuclear power, for example, would indeed reduce the carbon emissions of the companies, but it will take years, if not decades, for these additional nuclear plants to come online.) 

We submitted requests to Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI to have data-driven conversations about their models' energy demands for AI inference. None of the companies made executives or leadership available for on-the-record interviews about their energy usage.

While there are reasons to be concerned about AI's climate impact, all hope is not lost. Here's why.

The day after his inauguration in January, President Donald Trump announced Stargate, a $500 billion initiative to build out AI infrastructure, backed by some of the biggest companies in tech. Stargate aims to accelerate the construction of massive data centers and electricity networks across the US to ensure it keeps its edge over China.

This story is a part of MIT Technology Review's series “Power Hungry: AI and our energy future,” on the energy demands and carbon costs of the artificial-intelligence revolution.

The whatever-it-takes approach to the race for worldwide AI dominance was the talk of Davos, says Raquel Urtasun, founder and CEO of the Canadian robotruck startup Waabi, referring to the World Economic Forum's annual January meeting in Switzerland, which was held the same week as Trump's announcement. “I'm pretty worried about where the industry is going,” Urtasun says. 

She's not alone. “Dollars are being invested, GPUs are being burned, water is being evaporated—it's just absolutely the wrong direction,” says Ali Farhadi, CEO of the Seattle-based nonprofit Allen Institute for AI.

But sift through the talk of rocketing costs—and climate impact—and you'll find reasons to be hopeful. There are innovations underway that could improve the efficiency of the software behind AI models, the computer chips those models run on, and the data centers where those chips hum around the clock.

Here's what you need to know about how energy use, and therefore carbon emissions, could be cut across all three of those domains, plus an added argument for cautious optimism: There are reasons to believe that the underlying business realities will ultimately bend toward more energy-efficient AI.

The most obvious place to start is with the models themselves—the way they're created and the way they're run.

AI models are built by training neural networks on lots and lots of data. Large language models are trained on vast amounts of text, self-driving models are trained on vast amounts of driving data, and so on.

But the way such data is collected is often indiscriminate. Large language models are trained on data sets that include text scraped from most of the internet and huge libraries of scanned books. The practice has been to grab everything that's not nailed down, throw it into the mix, and see what comes out. This approach has certainly worked, but training a model on a massive data set over and over so it can extract relevant patterns by itself is a waste of time and energy.

The Chinese firm has pulled back the curtain to expose how the top labs may be building their next-generation models. Now things get interesting.

There might be a more efficient way. Children aren't expected to learn just by reading everything that's ever been written; they are given a focused curriculum. Urtasun thinks we should do something similar with AI, training models with more curated data tailored to specific tasks. (Waabi trains its robotrucks inside a superrealistic simulation that allows fine-grained control of the virtual data its models are presented with.)

It's not just Waabi. Writer, an AI startup that builds large language models for enterprise customers, claims that its models are cheaper to train and run in part because it trains them using synthetic data. Feeding its models bespoke data sets rather than larger but less curated ones makes the training process quicker (and therefore less expensive). For example, instead of simply downloading Wikipedia, the team at Writer takes individual Wikipedia pages and rewrites their contents in different formats—as a Q&A instead of a block of text, and so on—so that its models can learn more from less.

Training is just the start of a model's life cycle. As models have become bigger, they have become more expensive to run. So-called reasoning models that work through a query step by step before producing a response are especially power-hungry because they compute a series of intermediate subresponses for each response. The price tag of these new capabilities is eye-watering: OpenAI's o3 reasoning model has been estimated to cost up to $30,000 per task to run.  

But this technology is only a few months old and still experimental. Farhadi expects that these costs will soon come down. For example, engineers will figure out how to stop reasoning models from going too far down a dead-end path before they determine it's not viable. “The first time you do something it's way more expensive, and then you figure out how to make it smaller and more efficient,” says Farhadi. “It's a fairly consistent trend in technology.”

One way to get performance gains without big jumps in energy consumption is to run inference steps (the computations a model makes to come up with its response) in parallel, he says. Parallel computing underpins much of today's software, especially large language models (GPUs are parallel by design). Even so, the basic technique could be applied to a wider range of problems. By splitting up a task and running different parts of it at the same time, parallel computing can generate results more quickly. It can also save energy by making more efficient use of available hardware. But it requires clever new algorithms to coordinate the multiple subtasks and pull them together into a single result at the end. 

The largest, most powerful models won't be used all the time, either. There is a lot of talk about small models, versions of large language models that have been distilled into pocket-size packages. In many cases, these more efficient models perform as well as larger ones, especially for specific use cases.

As businesses figure out how large language models fit their needs (or not), this trend toward more efficient bespoke models is taking off. You don't need an all-purpose LLM to manage inventory or to respond to niche customer queries. “There's going to be a really, really large number of specialized models, not one God-given model that solves everything,” says Farhadi.

Christina Shim, chief sustainability officer at IBM, is seeing this trend play out in the way her clients adopt the technology. She works with businesses to make sure they choose the smallest and least power-hungry models possible. “It's not just the biggest model that will give you a big bang for your buck,” she says. A smaller model that does exactly what you need is a better investment than a larger one that does the same thing: “Let's not use a sledgehammer to hit a nail.”

As the software becomes more streamlined, the hardware it runs on will become more efficient too. There's a tension at play here: In the short term, chipmakers like Nvidia are racing to develop increasingly powerful chips to meet demand from companies wanting to run increasingly powerful models. But in the long term, this race isn't sustainable.

“The models have gotten so big, even running the inference step now starts to become a big challenge,” says Naveen Verma, cofounder and CEO of the upstart microchip maker EnCharge AI.

Companies like Microsoft and OpenAI are losing money running their models inside data centers to meet the demand from millions of people. Smaller models will help. Another option is to move the computing out of the data centers and into people's own machines.

That's something that Microsoft tried with its Copilot+ PC initiative, in which it marketed a supercharged PC that would let you run an AI model (and cover the energy bills) yourself. It hasn't taken off, but Verma thinks the push will continue because companies will want to offload as much of the costs of running a model as they can.

But getting AI models (even small ones) to run reliably on people's personal devices will require a step change in the chips that typically power those devices. These chips need to be made even more energy efficient because they need to be able to work with just a battery, says Verma.

That's where EnCharge comes in. Its solution is a new kind of chip that ditches digital computation in favor of something called analog in-memory computing. Instead of representing information with binary 0s and 1s, like the electronics inside conventional, digital computer chips, the electronics inside analog chips can represent information along a range of values in between 0 and 1. In theory, this lets you do more with the same amount of power. 

EnCharge was spun out from Verma's research lab at Princeton in 2022. “We've known for decades that analog compute can be much more efficient—orders of magnitude more efficient—than digital,” says Verma. But analog computers never worked well in practice because they made lots of errors. Verma and his colleagues have discovered a way to do analog computing that's precise.

EnCharge is focusing just on the core computation required by AI today. With support from semiconductor giants like TSMC, the startup is developing hardware that performs high-dimensional matrix multiplication (the basic math behind all deep-learning models) in an analog chip and then passes the result back out to the surrounding digital computer.

EnCharge's hardware is just one of a number of experimental new chip designs on the horizon. IBM and others have been exploring something called neuromorphic computing for years. The idea is to design computers that mimic the brain's super-efficient processing powers. Another path involves optical chips, which swap out the electrons in a traditional chip for light, again cutting the energy required for computation. None of these designs yet come close to competing with the electronic digital chips made by the likes of Nvidia. But as the demand for efficiency grows, such alternatives will be waiting in the wings. 

It is also not just chips that can be made more efficient. A lot of the energy inside computers is spent passing data back and forth. IBM says that it has developed a new kind of optical switch, a device that controls digital traffic, that is 80% more efficient than previous switches.   

Another huge source of energy demand is the need to manage the waste heat produced by the high-end hardware on which AI models run. Tom Earp, engineering director at the design firm Page, has been building data centers since 2006, including a six-year stint doing so for Meta. Earp looks for efficiencies in everything from the structure of the building to the electrical supply, the cooling systems, and the way data is transferred in and out.

For a decade or more, as Moore's Law tailed off, data-center designs were pretty stable, says Earp. And then everything changed. With the shift to processors like GPUs, and with even newer chip designs on the horizon, it is hard to predict what kind of hardware a new data center will need to house—and thus what energy demands it will have to support—in a few years' time. But in the short term the safe bet is that chips will continue getting faster and hotter: “What I see is that the people who have to make these choices are planning for a lot of upside in how much power we're going to need,” says Earp.

One thing is clear: The chips that run AI models, such as GPUs, require more power per unit of space than previous types of computer chips. And that has big knock-on implications for the cooling infrastructure inside a data center. “When power goes up, heat goes up,” says Earp.

With so many high-powered chips squashed together, air cooling (big fans, in other words) is no longer sufficient. Water has become the go-to coolant because it is better than air at whisking heat away. That's not great news for local water sources around data centers. But there are ways to make water cooling more efficient.

One option is to use water to send the waste heat from a data center to places where it can be used. In Denmark water from data centers has been used to heat homes. In Paris, during the Olympics, it was used to heat swimming pools.  

Water can also serve as a type of battery. Energy generated from renewable sources, such as wind turbines or solar panels, can be used to chill water that is stored until it is needed to cool computers later, which reduces the power usage at peak times.

But as data centers get hotter, water cooling alone doesn't cut it, says Tony Atti, CEO of Phononic, a startup that supplies specialist cooling chips. Chipmakers are creating chips that move data around faster and faster. He points to Nvidia, which is about to release a chip that processes 1.6 terabytes a second: “At that data rate, all hell breaks loose and the demand for cooling goes up exponentially,” he says.

According to Atti, the chips inside servers suck up around 45% of the power in a data center. But cooling those chips now takes almost as much power, around 40%. “For the first time, thermal management is becoming the gate to the expansion of this AI infrastructure,” he says.

Phononic's cooling chips are small thermoelectric devices that can be placed on or near the hardware that needs cooling. Power an LED chip and it emits photons; power a thermoelectric chip and it emits phonons (which are to vibrational energy—a.k.a. temperature—as photons are to light). In short, phononic chips push heat from one surface to another.

Squeezed into tight spaces inside and around servers, such chips can detect minute increases in heat and switch on and off to maintain a stable temperature. When they're on, they push excess heat into a water pipe to be whisked away. Atti says they can also be used to increase the efficiency of existing cooling systems. The faster you can cool water in a data center, the less of it you need.

Despite the explosion in AI's energy use, there's reason to be optimistic. Sustainability is often an afterthought or a nice-to-have. But with AI, the best way to reduce overall costs is to cut your energy bill. That's good news, as it should incentivize companies to increase efficiency. “I think we've got an alignment between climate sustainability and cost sustainability,” says Verma. ”I think ultimately that will become the big driver that will push the industry to be more energy efficient.”

Shim agrees: “It's just good business, you know?”

Companies will be forced to think hard about how and when they use AI, choosing smaller, bespoke options whenever they can, she says: “Just look at the world right now. Spending on technology, like everything else, is going to be even more critical going forward.”

Shim thinks the concerns around AI's energy use are valid. But she points to the rise of the internet and the personal computer boom 25 years ago. As the technology behind those revolutions improved, the energy costs stayed more or less stable even though the number of users skyrocketed, she says.

It's a general rule Shim thinks will apply this time around as well: When tech matures, it gets more efficient. “I think that's where we are right now with AI,” she says.

AI is fast becoming a commodity, which means that market competition will drive prices down. To stay in the game, companies will be looking to cut energy use for the sake of their bottom line if nothing else. 

In the end, capitalism may save us after all. 

A thorium-fueled reactor is the latest idea being revived after getting shelved in the mid-20th century.

Renewable energy is changing the grid. How can we keep it reliable?

Forget data centers—cooling is the real beast in energy demand.

Let's cut through the noise with cold, hard numbers.

The AI race is transforming northwestern Nevada into one of the world's largest data-center markets—and sparking fears of water strains in the nation's driest state.

In the high desert east of Reno, Nevada, construction crews are flattening the golden foothills of the Virginia Range, laying the foundations of a data center city.

Google, Tract, Switch, EdgeCore, Novva, Vantage, and PowerHouse are all operating, building, or expanding huge facilities within the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, a business park bigger than the city of Detroit. 

This story is a part of MIT Technology Review's series “Power Hungry: AI and our energy future,” on the energy demands and carbon costs of the artificial-intelligence revolution.

Meanwhile, Microsoft acquired more than 225 acres of undeveloped property within the center and an even larger plot in nearby Silver Springs, Nevada. Apple is expanding its data center, located just across the Truckee River from the industrial park. OpenAI has said it's considering building a data center in Nevada as well.

The corporate race to amass computing resources to train and run artificial intelligence models and store information in the cloud has sparked a data center boom in the desert—just far enough away from Nevada's communities to elude wide notice and, some fear, adequate scrutiny. 

The full scale and potential environmental impacts of the developments aren't known, because the footprint, energy needs, and water requirements are often closely guarded corporate secrets. Most of the companies didn't respond to inquiries from MIT Technology Review, or declined to provide additional information about the projects. 

But there's “a whole lot of construction going on,” says Kris Thompson, who served as the longtime project manager for the industrial center before stepping down late last year. “The last number I heard was 13 million square feet under construction right now, which is massive.”

Indeed, it's the equivalent of almost five Empire State Buildings laid out flat. In addition, public filings from NV Energy, the state's near-monopoly utility, reveal that a dozen data-center projects, mostly in this area, have requested nearly six gigawatts of electricity capacity within the next decade. 

That would make the greater Reno area—the biggest little city in the world—one of the largest data-center markets around the globe.

It would also require expanding the state's power sector by about 40%, all for a single industry in an explosive growth stage that may, or may not, prove sustainable. The energy needs, in turn, suggest those projects could consume billions of gallons of water per year, according to an analysis conducted for this story. 

The build-out of a dense cluster of energy and water-hungry data centers in a small stretch of the nation's driest state, where climate change is driving up temperatures faster than anywhere else in the country, has begun to raise alarms among water experts, environmental groups, and residents. That includes members of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, whose namesake water body lies within their reservation and marks the end point of the Truckee River, the region's main source of water.

Much of Nevada has suffered through severe drought conditions for years, farmers and communities are drawing down many of the state's groundwater reservoirs faster than they can be refilled, and global warming is sucking more and more moisture out of the region's streams, shrubs, and soils.

“Telling entities that they can come in and stick more straws in the ground for data centers is raising a lot of questions about sound management,” says Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network, a nonprofit that works to protect water resources throughout Nevada and Utah. 

“We just don't want to be in a situation where the tail is wagging the dog,” he later added, “where this demand for data centers is driving water policy.”

In the late 1850s, the mountains southeast of Reno began enticing prospectors from across the country, who hoped to strike silver or gold in the famed Comstock Lode. But Storey County had few residents or economic prospects by the late 1990s, around the time when Don Roger Norman, a media-shy real estate speculator, spotted a new opportunity in the sagebrush-covered hills. 

He began buying up tens of thousands of acres of land for tens of millions of dollars and lining up development approvals to lure industrial projects to what became the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center. His partners included Lance Gilman, a cowboy-hat-wearing real estate broker, who later bought the nearby Mustang Ranch brothel and won a seat as a county commissioner. 

In 1999, the county passed an ordinance that preapproves companies to develop most types of commercial and industrial projects across the business park, cutting months to years off the development process. That helped cinch deals with a flock of tenants looking to build big projects fast, including Walmart, Tesla, and Redwood Materials. Now the promise of fast permits is helping to draw data centers by the gigawatt.

On a clear, cool January afternoon, Brian Armon, a commercial real estate broker who leads the industrial practices group at NAI Alliance, takes me on a tour of the projects around the region, which mostly entails driving around the business center.

After pulling off Interstate 80 onto USA Parkway, he points out the cranes, earthmovers, and riprap foundations, where a variety of data centers are under construction. Deeper into the industrial park, Armon pulls up near Switch's long, low, arched-roof facility, which sits on a terrace above cement walls and security gates. The Las Vegas–based company says the first phase of its data center campus encompasses more than a million square feet, and that the full build-out will cover seven times that space. 

Over the next hill, we turn around in Google's parking lot. Cranes, tents, framing, and construction equipment extend behind the company's existing data center, filling much of the 1,210-acre lot that the search engine giant acquired in 2017.

Last August, during an event at the University of Nevada, Reno, the company announced it would spend $400 million to expand the data center campus along with another one in Las Vegas.

Thompson says that the development company, Tahoe Reno Industrial LLC, has now sold off every parcel of developable land within the park (although several lots are available for resale following the failed gamble of one crypto tenant).

When I ask Armon what's attracting all the data centers here, he starts with the fast approvals but cites a list of other lures as well: The inexpensive land. NV Energy's willingness to strike deals to supply relatively low-cost electricity. Cool nighttime and winter temperatures, as far as American deserts go, which reduce the energy and water needs. The proximity to tech hubs such as Silicon Valley, which cuts latency for applications in which milliseconds matter. And the lack of natural disasters that could shut down the facilities, at least for the most part.

“We are high in seismic activity,” he says. “But everything else is good. We're not going to have a tornado or flood or a devastating wildfire.”Then there's the generous tax policies.

Nevada doesn't charge corporate income tax, and it has also enacted deep tax cuts specifically for data centers that set up shop in the state. That includes abatements of up to 75% on property tax for a decade or two—and nearly as much of a bargain on the sales and use taxes applied to equipment purchased for the facilities.

Data centers don't require many permanent workers to run the operations, but the projects have created thousands of construction jobs. They're also helping to diversify the region's economy beyond casinos and generating tax windfalls for the state, counties, and cities, says Jeff Sutich, executive director of the Northern Nevada Development Authority. Indeed, just three data-center projects, developed by Apple, Google, and Vantage, will produce nearly half a billion dollars in tax revenue for Nevada, even with those generous abatements, according to the Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development.

The question is whether the benefits of data centers are worth the tradeoffs for Nevadans, given the public health costs, greenhouse-gas emissions, energy demands, and water strains.

The Sierra Nevada's granite peaks trace the eastern edge of California, forcing Pacific Ocean winds to rise and cool. That converts water vapor in the air into the rain and snow that fill the range's tributaries, rivers, and lakes. 

But the same meteorological phenomenon casts a rain shadow over much of neighboring Nevada, forming an arid expanse known as the Great Basin Desert. The state receives about 10 inches of precipitation a year, about a third of the national average.

The Truckee River draws from the melting Sierra snowpack at the edge of Lake Tahoe, cascades down the range, and snakes through the flatlands of Reno and Sparks. It forks at the Derby Dam, a Reclamation Act project a few miles from the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, which diverts water to a farming region further east while allowing the rest to continue north toward Pyramid Lake. 

Along the way, an engineered system of reservoirs, canals, and treatment plants divert, store, and release water from the river, supplying businesses, cities, towns, and native tribes across the region. But Nevada's population and economy are expanding, creating more demands on these resources even as they become more constrained. 

Throughout much of the 2020s the state has suffered through one of the hottest and most widespread droughts on record, extending two decades of abnormally dry conditions across the American West. Some scientists fear it may constitute an emerging megadrought. 

About 50% of Nevada currently faces moderate to exceptional drought conditions. In addition, more than half of the state's hundreds of groundwater basins are already “over-appropriated,” meaning the water rights on paper exceed the levels believed to be underground. 

It's not clear if climate change will increase or decrease the state's rainfall levels, on balance. But precipitation patterns are expected to become more erratic, whiplashing between short periods of intense rainfall and more-frequent, extended, or severe droughts. 

In addition, more precipitation will fall as rain rather than snow, shortening the Sierra snow season by weeks to months over the coming decades. 

“In the extreme case, at the end of the century, that's pretty much all of winter,” says Sean McKenna, executive director of hydrologic sciences at the Desert Research Institute, a research division of the Nevada System of Higher Education.

That loss will undermine an essential function of the Sierra snowpack: reliably delivering water to farmers and cities when it's most needed in the spring and summer, across both Nevada and California. 

These shifting conditions will require the region to develop better ways to store, preserve, and recycle the water it does get, McKenna says. Northern Nevada's cities, towns, and agencies will also need to carefully evaluate and plan for the collective impacts of continuing growth and development on the interconnected water system, particularly when it comes to water-hungry projects like data centers, he adds.“We can't consider each of these as a one-off, without considering that there may be tens or dozens of these in the next 15 years,” McKenna says.

Data centers suck up water in two main ways.

As giant rooms of server racks process information and consume energy, they generate heat that must be shunted away to prevent malfunctions and damage to the equipment. The processing units optimized for training and running AI models often draw more electricity and, in turn, produce more heat.

To keep things cool, more and more data centers have turned to liquid cooling systems that don't need as much electricity as fan cooling or air-conditioning.

These often rely on water to absorb heat and transfer it to outdoor cooling towers, where much of the moisture evaporates. Microsoft's US data centers, for instance, could have directly evaporated nearly 185,000 gallons of “clean freshwater” in the course of training OpenAI's GPT-3 large language model, according to a 2023 preprint study led by researchers at the University of California, Riverside. (The research has since been peer-reviewed and is awaiting publication.)

What's less appreciated, however, is that the larger data-center drain on water generally occurs indirectly, at the power plants generating extra electricity for the turbocharged AI sector. These facilities, in turn, require more water to cool down equipment, among other purposes. 

You have to add up both uses “to reflect the true water cost of data centers,” says Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC Riverside and coauthor of the study.

Ren estimates that the 12 data-center projects listed in NV Energy's report would directly consume between 860 million gallons and 5.7 billion gallons a year, based on the requested electricity capacity. (“Consumed” here means the water is evaporated, not merely withdrawn and returned to the engineered water system.) The indirect water drain associated with electricity generation for those operations could add up to 15.5 billion gallons, based on the average consumption of the regional grid.

The exact water figures would depend on shifting climate conditions, the type of cooling systems each data center uses, and the mix of power sources that supply the facilities.

Solar power, which provides roughly a quarter of Nevada's power, requires relatively little water to operate, for instance. But natural-gas plants, which generate about 56%, withdraw 2,803 gallons per megawatt-hour on average, according to the Energy Information Administration. 

Geothermal plants, which produce about 10% of the state's electricity by cycling water through hot rocks, generally consume less water than fossil fuel plants do but often require more water than other renewables, according to some research. 

But here too, the water usage varies depending on the type of geothermal plant in question. Google has lined up several deals to partially power its data centers through Fervo Energy, which has helped to commercialize an emerging approach that injects water under high pressure to fracture rock and form wells deep below the surface. 

The company stresses that it doesn't evaporate water for cooling and that it relies on brackish groundwater, not fresh water, to develop and run its plants. In a recent post, Fervo noted that its facilities consume significantly less water per megawatt-hour than coal, nuclear, or natural-gas plants do.

Part of NV Energy's proposed plan to meet growing electricity demands in Nevada includes developing several natural-gas peaking units, adding more than one gigawatt of solar power and installing another gigawatt of battery storage. It's also forging ahead with a more than $4 billion transmission project.But the company didn't respond to questions concerning how it will supply all of the gigawatts of additional electricity requested by data centers, if the construction of those power plants will increase consumer rates, or how much water those facilities are expected to consume.

“NV Energy teams work diligently on our long-term planning to make investments in our infrastructure to serve new customers and the continued growth in the state without putting existing customers at risk,” the company said in a statement.

An added challenge is that data centers need to run around the clock. That will often compel utilities to develop new electricity-generating sources that can run nonstop as well, as natural-gas, geothermal, or nuclear plants do, says Emily Grubert, an associate professor of sustainable energy policy at the University of Notre Dame, who has studied the relative water consumption of electricity sources. 

“You end up with the water-intensive resources looking more important,” she adds.

Even if NV Energy and the companies developing data centers do strive to power them through sources with relatively low water needs, “we only have so much ability to add six gigawatts to Nevada's grid,” Grubert explains. “What you do will never be system-neutral, because it's such a big number.”

On a mid-February morning, I meet TRI's Thompson and Don Gilman, Lance Gilman's son, at the Storey County offices, located within the industrial center. 

“I'm just a country boy who sells dirt,” Gilman, also a real estate broker, says by way of introduction. 

We climb into his large SUV and drive to a reservoir in the heart of the industrial park, filled nearly to the lip. 

Thompson explains that much of the water comes from an on-site treatment facility that filters waste fluids from companies in the park. In addition, tens of millions of gallons of treated effluent will also likely flow into the tank this year from the Truckee Meadows Water Authority Reclamation Facility, near the border of Reno and Sparks. That's thanks to a 16-mile pipeline that the developers, the water authority, several tenants, and various local cities and agencies partnered to build, through a project that began in 2021.

“Our general improvement district is furnishing that water to tech companies here in the park as we speak,” Thompson says. “That helps preserve the precious groundwater, so that is an environmental feather in the cap for these data centers. They are focused on environmental excellence.”

But data centers often need drinking-quality water—not wastewater merely treated to irrigation standards—for evaporative cooling, “to avoid pipe clogs and/or bacterial growth,” the UC Riverside study notes. For instance, Google says its data centers withdrew about 7.7 billion gallons of water in 2023, and nearly 6 billion of those gallons were potable. 

Tenants in the industrial park can potentially obtain access to water from the ground and the Truckee River, as well. From early on, the master developers worked hard to secure permits to water sources, since they are nearly as precious as development entitlements to companies hoping to build projects in the desert.

Initially, the development company controlled a private business, the TRI Water and Sewer Company, that provided those services to the business park's tenants, according to public documents. The company set up wells, a water tank, distribution lines, and a sewer disposal system. 

But in 2000, the board of county commissioners established a general improvement district, a legal mechanism for providing municipal services in certain parts of the state, to manage electricity and then water within the center. It, in turn, hired TRI Water and Sewer as the operating company.

As of its 2020 service plan, the general improvement district held permits for nearly 5,300 acre-feet of groundwater, “which can be pumped from well fields within the service area and used for new growth as it occurs.” The document lists another 2,000 acre-feet per year available from the on-site treatment facility, 1,000 from the Truckee River, and 4,000 more from the effluent pipeline. 

Those figures haven't budged much since, according to Shari Whalen, general manager of the TRI General Improvement District. All told, they add up to more than 4 billion gallons of water per year for all the needs of the industrial park and the tenants there, data centers and otherwise.

Whalen says that the amount and quality of water required for any given data center depends on its design, and that those matters are worked out on a case-by-case basis. 

When asked if the general improvement district is confident that it has adequate water resources to supply the needs of all the data centers under development, as well as other tenants at the industrial center, she says: “They can't just show up and build unless they have water resources designated for their projects. We wouldn't approve a project if it didn't have those water resources.”

As the region's water sources have grown more constrained, lining up supplies has become an increasingly high-stakes and controversial business.

More than a century ago, the US federal government filed a lawsuit against an assortment of parties pulling water from the Truckee River. The suit would eventually establish that the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe's legal rights to water for irrigation superseded other claims. But the tribe has been fighting to protect those rights and increase flows from the river ever since, arguing that increasing strains on the watershed from upstream cities and businesses threaten to draw away water reserved for reservation farming, decrease lake levels, and harm native fish.

The Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe considers the water body and its fish, including the endangered cui-ui and threatened Lahontan cutthroat trout, to be essential parts of its culture, identity, and way of life. The tribe was originally named Cui-ui Ticutta, which translates to cui-ui eaters. The lake continues to provide sustenance as well as business for the tribe and its members, a number of whom operate boat charters and fishing guide services.

“It's completely tied into us as a people,” says Steven Wadsworth, chairman of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe.

“That is what has sustained us all this time,” he adds. “It's just who we are. It's part of our spiritual well-being.”

In recent decades, the tribe has sued the Nevada State Engineer, Washoe County, the federal government, and others for overallocating water rights and endangering the lake's fish. It also protested the TRI General Improvement District's applications to draw thousands of additional acre‑feet of groundwater from a basin near the business park. In 2019, the State Engineer's office rejected those requests, concluding that the basin was already fully appropriated. 

More recently, the tribe took issue with the plan to build the pipeline and divert effluent that would have flown into the Truckee, securing an agreement that required the Truckee Meadows Water Authority and other parties to add back several thousand acre‑feet of water to the river. 

Whalen says she's sensitive to Wadsworth's concerns. But she says that the pipeline promises to keep a growing amount of treated wastewater out of the river, where it could otherwise contribute to rising salt levels in the lake.

“I think that the pipeline from [the Truckee Meadows Water Authority] to our system is good for water quality in the river,” she says. “I understand philosophically the concerns about data centers, but the general improvement district is dedicated to working with everyone on the river for regional water-resource planning—and the tribe is no exception.”

In an email, Thompson added that he has “great respect and admiration,” for the tribe and has visited the reservation several times in an effort to help bring industrial or commercial development there.He stressed that all of the business park's groundwater was “validated by the State Water Engineer,” and that the rights to surface water and effluent were purchased “for fair market value.”

During the earlier interview at the industrial center, he and Gilman had both expressed confidence that tenants in the park have adequate water supplies, and that the businesses won't draw water away from other areas. 

“We're in our own aquifer, our own water basin here,” Thompson said. “You put a straw in the ground here, you're not going to pull water from Fernley or from Reno or from Silver Springs.”

Gilman also stressed that data-center companies have gotten more water efficient in recent years, echoing a point others made as well.

“With the newer technology, it's not much of a worry,” says Sutich, of the Northern Nevada Development Authority. “The technology has come a long way in the last 10 years, which is really giving these guys the opportunity to be good stewards of water usage.”

Indeed, Google's existing Storey County facility is air-cooled, according to the company's latest environmental report. The data center withdrew 1.9 million gallons in 2023 but only consumed 200,000 gallons. The rest cycles back into the water system.

Google said all the data centers under construction on its campus will also “utilize air-cooling technology.” The company didn't respond to a question about the scale of its planned expansion in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, and referred a question about indirect water consumption to NV Energy.

The search giant has stressed that it strives to be water efficient across all of its data centers, and decides whether to use air or liquid cooling based on local supply and projected demand, among other variables.Four years ago, the company set a goal of replenishing more water than it consumes by 2030. Locally, it also committed to provide half a million dollars to the National Forest Foundation to improve the Truckee River watershed and reduce wildfire risks. 

Microsoft clearly suggested in earlier news reports that the Silver Springs land it purchased around the end of 2022 would be used for a data center. NAI Alliance's market real estate report identifies that lot, as well as the parcel Microsoft purchased within the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, as data center sites.

But the company now declines to specify what it intends to build in the region. 

“While the land purchase is public knowledge, we have not disclosed specific details [of] our plans for the land or potential development timelines,” wrote Donna Whitehead, a Microsoft spokesperson, in an email. 

Microsoft has also scaled down its global data-center ambitions, backing away from several projects in recent months amid shifting economic conditions, according to various reports.

Whatever it ultimately does or doesn't build, the company stresses that it has made strides to reduce water consumption in its facilities. Late last year, the company announced that it's using “chip-level cooling solutions” in data centers, which continually circulate water between the servers and chillers through a closed loop that the company claims doesn't lose any water to evaporation. It says the design requires only a “nominal increase” in energy compared to its data centers that rely on evaporative water cooling.

Others seem to be taking a similar approach. EdgeCore also said its 900,000-square-foot data center at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center will rely on an “air-cooled closed-loop chiller” that doesn't require water evaporation for cooling. 

But some of the companies seem to have taken steps to ensure access to significant amounts of water. Switch, for instance, took a lead role in developing the effluent pipeline. In addition, Tract, which develops campuses on which third-party data centers can build their own facilities, has said it lined up more than 1,100 acre-feet of water rights, the equivalent of nearly 360 million gallons a year. 

Apple, Novva, Switch, Tract, and Vantage didn't respond to inquiries from MIT Technology Review. 

The suggestion that companies aren't straining water supplies when they adopt air cooling is, in many cases, akin to saying they're not responsible for the greenhouse gas produced through their power use simply because it occurs outside of their facilities. In fact, the additional water used at a power plant to meet the increased electricity needs of air cooling may exceed any gains at the data center, Ren, of UC Riverside, says.

“That's actually very likely, because it uses a lot more energy,” he adds.

That means that some of the companies developing data centers in and around Storey County may simply hand off their water challenges to other parts of Nevada or neighboring states across the drying American West, depending on where and how the power is generated, Ren says. 

Google has said its air-cooled facilities require about 10% more electricity, and its environmental report notes that the Storey County facility is one of its two least-energy-efficient data centers. 

Some fear there's also a growing mismatch between what Nevada's water permits allow, what's actually in the ground, and what nature will provide as climate conditions shift. Notably, the groundwater committed to all parties from the Tracy Segment basin—a long-fought-over resource that partially supplies the TRI General Improvement District—already exceeds the “perennial yield.” That refers to the maximum amount that can be drawn out every year without depleting the reservoir over the long term.“If pumping does ultimately exceed the available supply, that means there will be conflict among users,” Roerink, of the Great Basin Water Network, said in an email. “So I have to wonder: Who could be suing whom? Who could be buying out whom? How will the tribe's rights be defended?”

The Truckee Meadows Water Authority, the community-owned utility that manages the water system for Reno and Sparks, said it is planning carefully for the future and remains confident there will be “sufficient resources for decades to come,” at least within its territory east of the industrial center.

Storey County, the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District, and the State Engineer's office didn't respond to questions or accept interview requests. 

As data center proposals have begun shifting into Northern Nevada's cities, more local residents and organizations have begun to take notice and express concerns. The regional division of the Sierra Club, for instance, recently sought to overturn the approval of Reno's first data center, about 20 miles west of the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center. 

Olivia Tanager, director of the Sierra Club's Toiyabe Chapter, says the environmental organization was shocked by the projected electricity demands from data centers highlighted in NV Energy's filings.

“We have increasing interest in understanding the impact that data centers will have to our climate goals, to our grid as a whole, and certainly to our water resources,” she says. “The demands are extraordinary, and we don't have that amount of water to toy around with.”

During a city hall hearing in January that stretched late into the evening, she and a line of residents raised concerns about the water, energy, climate, and employment impacts of AI data centers. At the end, though, the city council upheld the planning department's approval of the project, on a 5-2 vote.

“Welcome to Reno,” Kathleen Taylor, Reno's vice mayor, said before casting her vote. “We're open for business.”

In late March, I walk alongside Chairman Wadsworth, of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, on the shores of Pyramid Lake, watching a row of fly-fishers in waders cast their lines into the cold waters. 

The lake is the largest remnant of Lake Lahontan, an Ice Age inland sea that once stretched across western Nevada and would have submerged present-day Reno. But as the climate warmed, the lapping waters retreated, etching erosional terraces into the mountainsides and exposing tufa deposits around the lake, large formations of porous rock made of calcium-carbonate. That includes the pyramid-shaped island on the eastern shore that inspired the lake's name.

In the decades after the US Reclamation Service completed the Derby Dam in 1905, Pyramid Lake declined another 80 feet and nearby Winnemucca Lake dried up entirely.“We know what happens when water use goes unchecked,” says Wadsworth, gesturing eastward toward the range across the lake, where Winnemucca once filled the next basin over. “Because all we have to do is look over there and see a dry, barren lake bed that used to be full.”In an earlier interview, Wadsworth acknowledged that the world needs data centers. But he argued they should be spread out across the country, not densely clustered in the middle of the Nevada desert.

Given the fierce competition for resources up to now, he can't imagine how there could be enough water to meet the demands of data centers, expanding cities, and other growing businesses without straining the limited local supplies that should, by his accounting, flow to Pyramid Lake.

He fears these growing pressures will force the tribe to wage new legal battles to protect their rights and preserve the lake, extending what he refers to as “a century of water wars.”

“We have seen the devastating effects of what happens when you mess with Mother Nature,” Wadsworth says. “Part of our spirit has left us. And that's why we fight so hard to hold on to what's left.”

A thorium-fueled reactor is the latest idea being revived after getting shelved in the mid-20th century.

Renewable energy is changing the grid. How can we keep it reliable?

Forget data centers—cooling is the real beast in energy demand.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","Power Hungry: AI and our energy future","https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/ai-energy-package/","Tue, 20 May 2025 09:21:44 GMT","

It's well documented that AI is a power-hungry technology. But there has been far less reporting on the extent of that hunger, how much its appetite is set to grow in the coming years, where that power will come from, and who will pay for it. For the past six months, MIT Technology Review's team of reporters and editors have worked to answer those questions. The result is an unprecedented look at the state of AI's energy and resource usage, where it is now, where it is headed in the years to come, and why we have to get it right. 

At the centerpiece of this package is an entirely novel line of reporting into the demands of inference—the way human beings interact with AI when we make text queries or ask AI to come up with new images or create videos. Experts say inference is set to eclipse the already massive amount of energy required to train new AI models. We were so startled by what we learned reporting this story that we also put together a brief on everything you need to know about estimating AI's energy and emissions burden. 

And then we went out into the world to see the effects of this hunger. We take you into the deserts of Nevada, where data centers in an industrial park the size of Detroit demand ever more water to keep their processors cool and running. In Louisiana, where Meta plans its largest-ever data center, we expose the dirty secret that will fuel its AI ambitions—along with those of many others. Separately, we have a look at why the clean energy promise of powering AI data centers with nuclear energy will long remain elusive. 

Finally, we also look at the reasons to be optimistic, and examine why future AI systems could be far less energy intensive than today's.

This work was supported by a grant from the Tarbell Center for AI Journalism.

The emissions from individual AI text, image, and video queries seem small—until you add up what the industry isn't tracking and consider where it's heading next.

We unfortunately can't fit all our context and caveats in a story that's supposed to be readable.

Apple, Google, and other tech companies are planning huge AI or cloud storage data centers near Reno, sparking fears of water strains in America's driest state.

Electricity demand from AI data centers is driving a surge in new natural-gas power plants around the country. What does that mean for our clean-energy aspirations?

Tech giants are looking for more energy, but building new reactors takes time.

There are reasons to be concerned about the climate impact of artificial intelligence, but all hope is not lost. Here's why.

The rising energy cost of data centers is a vital test case for how we deal with the broader electrification of the economy.

Texas is set to lead the nation in restrictive legislation. Under a proposed bill, minors would be banned from social media, while platforms would also be required to introduce age verification methods. While supporters say the change would make children safer, critics argue that such legislation may do the exact opposite.

Introduced in November, House Bill 186 would prevent minors from creating accounts on social media platforms like Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and more. Platforms would be required to use “public or private transactional data” to verify that account holders are at least 18 years old. In addition, parents could request the deletion of any of their child's existing accounts. Companies would have to cooperate with that request within 10 days.

Under the law, social media platforms are limited to public websites or applications that allow users to communicate with each other “for the primary purpose of posting information, comments, messages, or images.” It wouldn't apply to e-mail, news, or gambling sties.

The bill's author, Rep. Jared Patterson, has consistently framed HB 186 as addressing a mental health crisis. In a March social media post, he wrote, “I consider this to be the most important bill I will present to my House colleagues this session. After extensive research, it's clear: social media is the most harmful product our kids have legal access to in Texas.”

According to the Age Verification Providers Associate, 10 states have passed their own legislation restricting minors' social media access since June 2024. Many laws center around limiting access to porn, like Texas' pre-existing HB 1181, which requires age verification if at least a third of a website's content is “sexual material harmful to minors.” (That law is now at the center of a Supreme Court case.) But per the Texas Tribune, Florida is the only other state with a similar outright ban on social media for minors. However, it only extends to those under 14.

HB 186 has already passed Texas' House with bipartisan support and, so far, it seems that members of the Senate are fans as well. Per the Texas Tribune, Sen. Adam Hinojosa, co-sponsor, told fellow lawmakers at a recent State Affairs Committee hearing, “Like so many parents across our state, I've watched my children grow up in a world that feels less and less safe, not because of where they go physically, but because of where they go online, in spaces that my wife and I cannot possibly monitor at all times.”

“We have the ability and the power to act today,” Hinojosa also told lawmakers. “With House Bill 186, we confront the evil before us and boldly say, ‘You cannot have our children.'”

It's true that social media harms youth (and adults, too). In 2023, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned that although social media's impacts aren't fully understood, “There are ample indicators that [it] can also have a profound risk of harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents.” Following Murthy's comments, the American Psychological Association released a health advisory on adolescent social media use. It also released a report with the American Federation for Teachers and several other organizations detailing social media's contribution to worsening mental health.

But strict bills like HB 186 don't necessarily address that problem. As Morgan McGuire, a 17-year-old Texas resident and TikTok creator, said, per the Texas Tribune, “The harmful content that young people are exposed to online does not disappear when they turn 18. The bill throws young adults into a digital world at a time when they are living on their own for the first time, without the support systems that they had as minors, which can have serious harm on mental health.”

Age verification bills have also faced backlash for violating First Amendment rights. In a statement, Megan Stokes, state policy director for the Computer & Communications Industry Association, said, “HB 186 conflicts with Texas contract law and undermines teens' rights to access information, express themselves, and participate in today's digital economy…[It] is a flawed proposal, one that censors speech rather than supporting families with tools and education.”

In a letter, trade association NetChoice's director of policy, Patrick Hedger, noted that age verification laws in several other states are already being challenged and blocked by courts, including in Arkansas, California, Mississippi, Texas, and Utah. Hedger also said that Texas' proposed legislation “usurps parental decision making,” writing, “Every family has different needs. Some parents may allow their child to use YouTube Kids for educational videos, and others may choose to let their teen join a moderated online community to discuss their hobbies or interests.”

“These are choices that parents and guardians should have the right to make depending on their own child's needs — rather than the government mandating how families in Texas use the internet,” Hedger continued.

Along with First Amendment concerns, age verification bills like HB 186 are privacy nightmares. Although the legislation says that social media platforms must delete personal data gathered for age verification, it doesn't explicitly state how soon nor does it provide social media platforms with guidance on how to prove their compliance. Per Hedger, this oversight incentivizes platforms to collect “multiple forms of personally-identifiable information.”

“Platforms may utilize and delete one piece of ‘transactional data' for age verification, while collecting and retaining other personal data for purposes of legal defense,” Hedger wrote. “This means websites would need to collect and store sensitive information, creating massive databases that will inevitable become targets for hackers.”

When it comes to portable phone chargers, having cables built right in constitutes convenience on an entirely new level and that's precisely why this Charmast portable charger is selling out on Amazon's Memorial Day deals.

Only available to Prime members, this top-rated 10,000mAh power bank normally sells for $29 but it is currently on sale for $19. With over 7,000 glowing five-star reviews, it's not hard to see why users love how easy and convenient this charger is to use.

See at Amazon

What makes this charger quite unique is its clever design that stores three output cables and one input cable inside the long, thin power bank. This means you don't need to carry an entangled mess of wires with you to charge your devices. No matter if you own an iPhone, Samsung, Pixel or other Micro USB or USB-C devices, this one charger suits them all. The attached cables are intelligently designed to fit any number of devices, so you can charge your tablet, phone, or other device without having to find the right cable or being scared you'll leave one behind.

The charger is not done with being useful—it's impressively competent. With three channels and six output ports, it can charge six devices simultaneously which is perfect for multi-device owners or families with many devices to have charged on the road. The three inputs include an internal recharging cable, Micro USB port, and USB-C port, giving you several avenues to charge the power bank itself.

The charger is also incredibly super slim and lightweight: At only just under six inches long and half a pound, it's no larger than a lighter or a small smart phone and easily fits in your bag or even a large pocket.

MSI has AMD and Intel handhelds now.

MSI brought its first gaming handheld with an AMD chip inside, the Claw A8 BZ2EM, to Computex. The company also used Taipei tradeshow to launch the latest versions of its Crosshair and Cyborg laptops.

MSI's previous gaming handhelds, like its Claw 8 AI+, used Intel's Core Ultra processors — the only mainstream gaming company to do so. It doesn't seem that MSI is abandoning Intel, but is now making systems with chips from both partners.

Beyond using AMD's Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, the Claw A8 will have other new features. The system, which is very green, has an Xbox-style controller layout, placing the right thumbstick below the A/B/X/Y buttons. MSI is using Hall Effect joysticks, which should help prevent stick drift. The Claw A8 also has Hall Effect sensors in the LT and RT triggers.The company has rounded the corners and put in bigger grips, which should increase comfort over previous Claw systems.

The option for up to 24GB of RAM is impressive (especially fast LPDDR5x-8000 memory), but MSI hasn't said anything about what configurations will go to which markets, so we'll see how systems launch with that much memory. Asus used 24GB of memory in the ROG Ally X, one of the best PC Gaming Handhelds, which benefitted because the CPU and GPU share memory.



The 80 WHr battery on the Claw is also identical in capacity to the Ally X, which lasted far longer than the original ROG Ally with a smaller 40 WHr battery.The top of the system features plenty of ports, including a headphone jack, microSD card reader, two USB 4 Type-C ports, as well as a volume rocker and a power button with a built-in fingerprint reader. While the microSD card reader is expected at this point, MSI is also using a standard M.2 2280 SSD, so in theory you could easily crack the system open and replace it with a standard-sized M.2 drive. MSI has refreshed its MSI Center software to be accessible via Xbox Game Bar. This should take up less space and allow for extra customization, but it's still building on top of Windows 11, which hasn't proven to be the most intuitive operating system for gaming handhelds.MSI hasn't announced pricing or a release date for the Claw A8.

Like Acer and Asus, MSI brought its mid-range gaming notebooks to Computex, upgrading them to Nvidia's new RTX 5060 and the RTX 5070.



The new Crosshairs will come in 16, 17, and 18-inch sizes. Confusingly enough, using the 18-inchers as examples, the Intel models are styled Crosshair 18 HX AI, while the AMD versions are Crosshair A18HX. So AI means Intel Core Ultra 200 HX chips here, while the A-series systems use AMD Ryzen 8000.

Other than that, the systems have a ton of commonalities. They all use Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 or RTX 5060 GPUs ""and below"" (whether that means an upcoming RTX 5050 or older generation chips remains to be seen) and go up to 115W on the GPU and 170W on the CPU. All of the systems have 90 WHr batteries, Wi-Fi 6E, and 2560 x 1600, 240 Hz screens.MSI only sent along configurations for the Crosshair 18HX AI, which will start at $1,699 at Costco and features a Core Ultra 9 275HX, Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. For $2,049, you'll be able to get 64GB of RAM.

MSI hasn't detailed full specifications, so while we know Intel will have slightly faster RAM, we don't know how much RAM many of these systems will ship with. We do know that they have a MUX switch on the motherboard, new crosshair logos on the hinge and touchpad, and, on the 18-inchers, a 24-zone RGB keyboard. MSI didn't provide pricing or release information for these systems.



There's also a refresh to the Cyborg line, which comes in 15 and 17-inch sizes. These systems use translucent plastic on the edges but still have a metal lid. The Cyborg 15 and Cyborg 17 will use Intel Core 200H chips and RTX 5060, 5070, ""and below"" graphics cards, while the Cyborg A15 AI and A17 AI (yes, here AI stands for AMD), will opt for Ryzen 200 series processors. The 15-inch screens come in either 1080p at 144 Hz or 1440p at 165 Hz. if you opt for 17 inches, MSI has gone for a 1080p/144 Hz screen or a 1440p, 240 Hz option. Again, we only have partial pricing here, and no availability. The Cyborg A15 AI will start at $1,149 at Costco with a Ryzen 7 260, RTX 5050 (which we were surprised to see in a sheet sent to press), 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. For $1,399 at Best Buy, you can go up to a Ryzen 9 270 and RTX 5060. The 17-inch AMD model will be $1,549 at Costco with the Ryzen 9 270, RTX 5060, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. MSI's other Computex announcements include some productivity laptops, including a new Stealth A16 AI+ and Prestige 16 AI+ notebook that further MSI's partnership with AMG Motorsport. Additionally, there's a new Prestige 13 AI+ ""Ukiyuo-e Edition,"" a limited edition showcasing ""The Great Wave off Kanagawa"" that will be individually crafted by artists.

It's all thanks to its new software: Virtual Stream Deck 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


At Computex 2025, Elgato has unveiled ""Stream Deck Everywhere."" This new initiative includes a handful of new projects—some minor, with others shaking up our expectations a bit. Perhaps the most exciting development is for the Virtual Stream Deck (VSD) application, which aims to bring Elgato's Stream Deck interface to a new range of devices.

A variant of the Stream Deck MK.2 is releasing with a new key switch option. This edition will be fitted with Scissor-Switch keys and is promised to provide a faster response time than regular membrane keys. These switches are very thin and don't have as far to move before they actuate, making them a highly responsive option for some. If you're not familiar with the Stream Deck MK.2, check out our review to see what it's capable of. Overall, we enjoyed our experience and gave it a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.



There's also a new network dock by the same name, Network Dock, that offers a hardwired network option for Stream Deck devices. It connects to the Stream Deck via USB and supports both PoE and non-PoE connections. Corsair, Elgato's parent company, confirmed that the IP address could be managed directly on the device.

The Stream Deck Module is another new product, this one is slated to provide a modular platform for DIY enthusiasts to build their own control systems. There are three varieties available in different sizes, including 6-key, 15-key, and 32-key. These are housed inside an aluminum chassis intended to easily drop into projects.



We're particularly interested in the Virtual Stream Deck (VSD), as well. This application is intended to allow users to simulate a Stream Deck virtually, as the name suggests, on screen. This effectively lets you turn your own devices into an Elgato Stream Deck. Open source alternatives have existed for a while, like this Raspberry Pi-powered DIY stream deck, but this is an official launch from Elgato, which can be appealing in its own right. The new VSD software will slowly be made available to more devices over time.

Unlimited power!


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Asus just introduced a 3000-watt Asus Pro Workstation power supply unit, which the manufacturer claims has enough juice to power four RTX 5090 graphics cards. The PSU has four 12V-2x6 power ports and also comes with its own etched cables with CPU and PCIe power connectors. More importantly, Asus put all this power in a compact package measuring just 175 mm in length.

The Asus Pro Workstation PSU is 80 PLUS Platinum certified, ensuring that the power you're consuming is used to run your computer and not being wasted as heat. At the same time, its fan is equipped with two ball bearings, ensuring that it will last up to 80,000 hours of continuous use — that translates to more than nine years of being plugged in.

Asus also designed the included cables to run 50 degrees cooler than the safety limit, helping prevent the melting connector issue that plagued high-powered RTX 50-series and 40-series GPUs. The cables themselves used pliable cables, making for easier installation and cable management, as well as helping users avoid improper cable seating.

This PSU is also PCIe 5.1- and ATX 3.1-compatible, ensuring you can use it for years to come. So, even if you upgrade your components three to five years down the line, you don't have to worry about replacing your power supply because it no longer conforms to the latest standards.

This much power isn't designed for the average gamer. After all, a standard U.S. 15-amp, 120-volt outlet can only handle up to 1,800 watts. If you want to use this puppy, you need 25 to 30 amps on a 120-volt outlet to ensure that you don't overload the circuit breaker. Alternatively, you can use a 15- to 20-amp outlet with 240 volts.

Asus built this PSU to deliver power for AI computers that require multiple GPUs. We've previously seen 2500-watt PSUs launch at Computex last year, like the HELA 2500R, which is designed to power four RTX 4090s. But as the 5090s require more power, developers who want to take advantage of these more powerful GPUs require a more capable PSU.

The average gamer would not need this much power, though. Even if you have three 4K monitors running off a single RTX 5090, and you paired it with the best gaming CPU, 3000 watts is overkill. You're much better off picking one of the best PSUs for gaming — that way, you can put the extra cash you save towards other accessories. Besides, you don't want to trip your home's circuit breakers by plugging in a PC that uses too much power.

The company also announced a new DIY mechanical keyboard and power supply units


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Corsair is making a big splash at Computex 2025 with the launch of its new products, including new cases, a fully customizable keyboard, and new power supplies. The most eye-catching of them all is the Air 5400, which is its first PC case with a triple-chamber layout.

The new Air 5400 comes with a dedicated radiator cooling chamber that can accommodate up to 360mm AIO cooling solutions. The unique aspect here is that all the heat from the CPU is dumped directly out of the case as it is channeled separately without interfering with other components. The main or central chamber comes with an air duct allowing the cooling fans at the bottom to focus air flow for the GPU and motherboard. The third chamber, behind the motherboard, can accommodate mass storage drives and the power supply, along with all the cables.

The case also comes with curved glass hinged panels, and comes pre-installed with reverse blade fans (Corsair RS-R ARGB or LX-R) at the bottom with bright LED RGB lighting. Corsair also highlights its Rapid Route 2.0 cable management system, which is said to help simplify cable management. There is also support for motherboards with back connectors and additional triple-120mm fan mounting options at the top. In terms of front I/O, the case comes with two USB Type-C 5 Gbps ports, one USB Type-C 20 Gbps port, and a 3.5mm audio combo jack. For storage, you can install a 3.5-inch HDD or two 2.5-inch HDD/SSDs.

Next is the Frame 4500X PC case featuring a wraparound tempered glass panel that covers both the front and side, thus offering a clear view of the internal hardware. It supports GPUs up to 460mm in length, CPU coolers up to 185mm in height, and power supplies up to 250mm in length. For cooling, it offers multiple fan mounting options, including support for up to three 120mm or two 140mm fans at the top or side, a single 120mm or 140mm fan at the rear, and a single 120mm fan at the bottom. Additionally, it can accommodate 360mm radiators on both the top and side panels.

Storage options include one 3.5-inch HDD bay and two 2.5-inch SSD mounts. The front I/O panel provides two USB 3.2 Type-A Gen 1 ports, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port, and a combined headphone/microphone jack. Available in black and white color options, the Frame 4500X will be offered with the option of three pre-installed 120mm Corsair RS-R ARGB or LX-R RGB fans. Like the Air 5400, the case supports reverse-connect motherboards, and also incorporates Corair's ‘InfiniRail' fan mounting system, which uses adjustable steel brackets allowing users to slide and position fans appropriately.

Corsair also announced the Frame 5000D, a bigger version of the existing Frame 4000D case. It comes with support for up to 420mm radiator at the top alongside the Infinirail fan mounting system, RapidRoute 2.0 cable management, and support for reverse connection motherboards. The case will offer a variety of modular panels, both on the inside and outsid,e allowing users to customize the case as per their liking.

Moving away from PC cases, the new Corsair MAKR 75 is a 75% DIY barebones keyboard kit targeted specifically at users who want to build and customize their own mechanical keyboard. It has won the Red Design award for 2025, and comes with a full aluminum frame available in Carbon and Silver finish options. While it naturally supports hot-swappable switches, Corsair doesn't mention support for third-party switches. You can, however, choose between the company's MLX switches, including Pulse Thocky, Plasma Linear, Quantum Speed, and Fusion Tactile.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.



The MAKR 75 also comes with a programmable dial and an optional LCD module that can display system stats or custom graphics. Internally, it utilizes a gasket mount design with screw-in stabilizers, which should offer a softer typing experience with reduced vibration. Users can choose between polycarbonate or FR4 switch plates, each offering different levels of rigidity and acoustic profiles. The add-on wireless module adds 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth to the keyboard if you prefer a cable-free experience. For further personalization, the keyboard comes with RGB backlighting and support for various keycap profiles and colors.

Moving onto PSUs, the new Corsair HXi Shift series includes modular ATX power supplies available in 1,000W, 1,200W, and 1,500W capacities. These units meet the latest ATX 3.1 and PCIe 5.1 standards and feature side-mounted power connectors, which can potentially help make cable management a lot easier. Like the company's previous power supplies, the new lineup uses high-quality Japanese 105°C capacitors and is rated for continuous operation at up to 50°C. There's also a 140mm fluid dynamic bearing fan with Zero-RPM mode for quiet operation under low to moderate loads.



The new PSUs also come with support for Corsair's iCUE Link thanks to an integrated hub. Essentially this allows users to connect and control up to 24 compatible iCUE Link devices, including fans and RGB lighting, directly through the power supply thereby reducing the need for additional hubs and cables. The units also support real-time monitoring and configuration via Corsair's iCUE software, offering insights into power usage and temperature, and allowing adjustments to fan curves and power settings.

Say goodbye to sharp edges


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


PC case innovation is always something to look forward to at Computex, and Computex 2025 is no different. This year, Hyte has something special in store. Their latest case is the X50, which comes in a variety of colors and a unique design language that is deprived of any sharp edges. Available in an all-mesh (X50 Air) design, the case features 1 mm-thick rounded steel frames paired with micro-mesh panels, while the standard edition includes a 4mm laminated glass side panel.

According to Hyte, considerable effort went into perfecting the micro-mesh pattern, especially around the curved edges. This distinctive design is said to not only enhance airflow efficiency but also accommodate up to 10 fans. The case is built using automotive-grade tooling, allowing for compound rounded curves with tolerances four times tighter than the industry standard.

The X50 Air will be available exclusively in Snow White and Pitch Black colors, the standard X50 will be available in Snow White, Pitch Black, Cherry, Taro Milk, Strawberry Milk, and Matcha Milk colors. The colored variants will get special, rounded paw-shaped feet at the bottom.

The rear of the case is also quite interesting as it features horizontal air vents, almost like the fins on a CPU cooler. Hyte says that the patent-pending ‘Louvered Blade Ventilation' helps reduce exhaust impedance and reinforces case rigidity.

In terms of fan and cooler support, the bottom can accommodate three 120mm extra-thick fans, and you can install a 360mm radiator for AiO cooling solutions at the front or side. There's a special PSU canopy at the rear-top which can accommodate full-size ATX power supplies and offers space for managing cables, along with a cutout for the PSU fan to pull in air.

Other notable features include tool-free front and side panel removal, special cable routing channels, an adjustable modular radiator bracket at the front, and a metal caddy to mount hard drives or SSDs. Hyte is also planning to launch color-matched fans, while each case will feature a limited edition custom Hyte logo badge at the rear, depending on when you buy the case. The first 1,000 units of the case will come with a gold polished badge, silver for the first 1,001-10,000 units, and bronze for 10,001 to 1,00,000 units.

The X50 and X50 Air are set to launch this summer, priced at $149.99 and $119.99, respectively, excluding VAT or tariffs.

The company was recently in the news for pausing shipments of certain products to U.S. customers due to newly announced import tariffs on Chinese-manufactured goods. Despite continuing to fulfill existing pre-orders, Hyte had paused or redirected new shipments to other regions. Hopefully, with the tariff laws changed once again, we will be able to see the new X50 in stores soon.

 May 20, 2025  

For decades, oral contraceptive options have been limited to women, while men have had only two choices: Condoms or vasectomy. That could change with the development of YCT-529, a nonhormonal male contraceptive currently in phase 2 clinical trials, which offers a novel mechanism for inhibiting the production of viable sperm.

Developed by YourChoice Therapeutics, a US-based biotech company, YCT-529 targets retinoic acid receptor alpha, a protein critical for sperm production. “When this receptor is blocked, spermatogenesis is disrupted. In animal studies, infertility in rats was observed after 4 weeks of use, while in primates, a significant reduction in sperm production occurred within just 2 weeks,” explained Arie Carneiro, MD, PhD, urologist and researcher at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Sao Paulo, Brazil, who is not involved in the study.

YCT-529 represents a significant shift from most previous male contraceptive strategies that have largely relied on hormonal suppression using testosterone or other hormone combinations. “These hormone-based methods have been associated with unwanted side effects, including mood changes, erectile dysfunction, and muscle mass loss,” said Giuliano Aita, MD, urologist and member of the Brazilian Society of Urology. “YCT-529 is innovative because it avoids disrupting male sex hormone pathways,” he added.

According to Alex Meller, MD, urologist, and professor at the Paulista School of Medicine of the Federal University of Sao Paulo, this nonhormonal approach may improve acceptance among men. “Other male contraceptives tested previously were often combined with progesterone or testosterone blockers. Even when designed to act locally, these compounds tend to cause sexual side effects,” he noted.

Preclinical trials in animals have shown that YCT-529 has a favorable safety profile. “In mice, the compound achieved 99% efficacy in preventing pregnancy, with minimal adverse effects,” said Aita. Additionally, no significant clinical toxicity or laboratory abnormalities have been reported. Testosterone levels remained unchanged, confirming the drug's nonhormonal mode of action, added Carneiro.

One of the major concerns with male contraceptives is reversibility, the ability to restore fertility after discontinuation. YCT-529 has shown promising results in animal studies. “In rats, normal sperm levels returned about 6 weeks after stopping the drug. In primates, recovery was observed between 2 and 3 months,” said Carneiro.

“This timing is in line with the natural sperm production cycle, which takes about 12 weeks to be produced and become viable,” said Meller. “Once the medication is stopped, this is the natural time for a new generation of sperm to be formed, and fertility restored.”

With phase 1 clinical trials completed — though no results have been publicly released — YCT-529 has entered phase 2 trials. An ongoing study based in New Zealand is currently recruiting male volunteers who are either awaiting vasectomy or do not wish to have children.

“For this drug to be used clinically, it must demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans at scale,” said Aita. “Clinical trials will need to confirm that the drug reliably prevents conception, is reversible, and does not produce serious side effects. Researchers must also determine the optimal dosage and confirm that fertility restoration is predictable following discontinuation.”

While women have access to a wide range of contraceptive options, progress toward safe, reversible, and effective male contraceptives has been slow and fraught with challenges.

“Sperm production is continuous and high in volume, which requires a more robust mechanism of suppression compared to female contraceptives,” noted Carneiro. “There is also heightened concern about preserving long-term fertility and avoiding hormonal side effects that could affect overall health and sexual function.”

Several male contraceptive methods are currently being developed alongside YCT-529. “One example is the hormonal contraceptive gel of norethisterone + testosterone, which is applied to the skin daily and is already in phase 2 of clinical studies,” said Aita. “Also in the preclinical phase, there is the nonhormonal contraceptive EPPIN [epididymal protease inhibitor], which blocks sperm function.” 

According to the Aita, “devices such as Vasalgel, a type of reversible ‘plug' in the vas deferens, are also being developed as nonhormonal alternatives.” 

However, Vasalgel may have encountered a stumbling block. “The gel is applied inside the duct, which leads to this blockage, and this obstruction must be reversed by applying a specific substance to the same region. However, in some cases, it was difficult to reverse it. This is the point that is proving most difficult to resolve,” warned Meller. 

Another male contraceptive currently being tested is dimethandrolone undecanoate, an oral medication that works by inhibiting sperm production through hormonal action. “There is also another experimental nonhormonal method, based on compounds from cottonseed, but it is in a very early stage [of development],” said Meller. 

Despite promising clinical progress, one key challenge remains: Male adherence to contraceptive methods. “For a contraceptive to be widely accepted by men, it must be effective, easy to use, have minimal or no noticeable side effects, and offer reliable reversibility,” explained Aita. He also emphasized the importance of public awareness: “Educational campaigns will be essential to shift societal attitudes and reinforce the idea that contraceptive responsibility can — and should — be shared between partners.”

If YCT-529 continues to demonstrate efficacy and safety in upcoming clinical trials, it could become a much-needed addition to reproductive medicine, offering men a viable and reversible option for fertility control, a gap that remains largely unaddressed in current contraceptive strategies.

 May 20, 2025  

Suicide rates among residents have remained steady since the turn of the century despite increased attention to physician mental health, a new study found.

However, residents — like physicians in general — continue to be much less likely to kill themselves than nonphysicians.

The suicide rate among medical residents was 4.89 per 100,000 person-years from 2015 to 2021 (47 people) vs 4.07 per 100,000 person-years from 2000 to 2014 (66 people), reported Nicholas A. Yaghmour, MPP, of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in Chicago, and colleagues in JAMA Network Open. The difference was not statistically significant.

In contrast, the rate of cancer deaths among residents declined by nearly 40% from 2000-2014 to 2015-2021 (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.90; P < .05).

Overall, suicides among medical residents remain very rare. According to the study, they're 70% less common in the 30- to 34-year-old age group than in the age-matched general population.

Still, “a resident or fellow death by suicide is a devastating event that harms patients, peers, attending physicians, and clinical staff,” Yaghmour told Medscape Medical News.

The study updates a 2017 report by the same team that examined resident deaths from 2000 to 2014. For both reports, researchers tracked deaths in ACGME-accredited residency and fellowship programs, which are required to account for trainees who depart, and consulted a federal database and other sources for information about causes of death.

During the 2015-2021 period, 161 residents and fellows died while in training (111 men and 50 women). Suicide was the most common cause, accounting for 29.2% of deaths (47 total: 35 men and 12 women).

The researchers didn't find higher numbers of suicides during the COVID-19 pandemic period.

The number of suicides tracked by the new report is small, making it difficult to detect trends, said Douglas Mata, MD, MPH, a Boston pathologist who studies physician mental health but was not involved in the research.

Still, “we can likely conclude that suicide rates have not meaningfully decreased, which is a concerning finding that warrants further study,” he told Medscape Medical News.

The study noted that residents are much less likely than the rest of the population to die by suicide. For the entire period from 2000 to 2021, the rate of suicide among residents aged 30-34 years was less than a third of the rate among the comparable general population (IRR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.20-0.35; P < .05).

As for physicians overall, it's been widely reported that they're at twice the risk for suicide compared with their nonphysician peers. But a 2025 JAMA Psychiatry study reported that male physicians were less likely to die by suicide than men in their general population. Female physicians, however, had a higher suicide rate than their female peers.

From 2000 to 2021, residents aged 30-34 years were much less likely to die than the age-matched general population (IRR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.11-0.14; P < .05), the report found.

Cancer was the second most common cause of death among residents at 17.4% (28 total: 14 men and 14 women), followed by accidental poisoning at 13.0% (21 total: 19 men and 2 women) and accidents at 13.7% (22 total: 16 men and 6 women).

The dip in cancer rates could reflect improvements in healthcare services for residents and better overall cancer outcomes, Yaghmour said.

By comparison, in 2021, accidents were the top cause of death in the United States for people aged 25-44 years based on age-adjusted mortality rates, followed by COVID-19, heart disease, suicide, and cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Among the suicides of 43 residents (excluding fellows), nine occurred during the first 3 months of the first year of residency. Another six happened during the final quarter of the second year.

Mata said the findings about suicide timing make sense.

“The first quarter of the intern year brings isolation, exhaustion, anxiety, and the shock of entering clinical practice — often while moving to a new city with no friends or family support,” Mata said. “The fourth quarter of PGY-2 brings new stressors: Rising clinical responsibility, career planning pressures, and, in some cases, worsening burnout.”

Sen, who experienced depression himself and lost a close friend to suicide during residency, said workload is “far and away” the biggest contributor to depression during training. “If we can create a healthier system, we could reduce the number of people who get depressed.”

Mata agreed, pointing to predictable stressors in residency, including long work hours, sleep deprivation, lack of control over schedules, and the high-stakes nature of patient care.

“As a resident, you are continually being thrown onto new clinical services, trying to meet the expectations of new attendings, and encountering unfamiliar diseases,” Mata said.

Mata emphasized that suicide rates alone may not be the best metric for measuring well-being interventions. More sensitive indicators, like rates of screening positive for depression or job satisfaction surveys, would better detect improvements, he said.

However, suicide rates remaining stable worries Mata.

“This finding suggests that surface-level wellness efforts alone aren't enough and that continued structural reforms could be considered,” he said.

“These things often cost money, so there's resistance in medicine to doing that,” he noted.

Mata recommended a back-to-basics approach: “Enforce reasonable work hours, protect time for sleep, provide easy access to confidential mental healthcare, foster supportive program cultures, and normalize seeking help.” He highlighted a 2016 study that estimated only 16% of medical students who screen positive for depression seek help.

“Residency demands are inherently stressful because becoming a doctor carries enormous responsibility,” he said. “Real change will require creating cultures where vulnerability is not treated as a liability, and where seeking help is seen as a sign of strength, not weakness.”

No study funding was reported. Yaghmour, Mata, and Sen had no disclosures.

 May 20, 2025  

A regimen that spares patients recovering from cataract surgery the burden of using antibacterial and anti-inflammatory eye drops several times a day for weeks and instead uses an injection to administer those drugs immediately after the procedure is nearly as effective at preventing complications as the traditional drop regimen at a fraction of the cost, a study of both approaches found.

“Our study aims to underscore the benefits of the dropless cataract surgery approach as a promising alternative to the traditional drop regimen, particularly for populations where adherence to postoperative drops is challenging,” Yousef Yousef, a medical student at the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Buffalo, New York, told Medscape Medical News. “We hope our findings will encourage broader adoption of the dropless protocol by cataract surgeons, potentially establishing it as a new standard of care.”

Yousef presented results from a retrospective chart review of 544 eyes that had cataract surgery at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) 2025 Annual Meeting in Salt Lake City.

The traditional protocol, used in 265 study eyes, consisted of giving patients a prescription for drops of the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid prednisolone 1%, the antibiotic moxifloxacin 0.5%, and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ketorolac 0.5% four times a day with a 4-week taper. The dropless protocol, assigned to 279 eyes, consisted of an intracameral injection of 0.2 mL of moxifloxacin 0.5% and a 10 mg/mL subconjunctival injection of the glucocorticoid triamcinolone (Kenalog) on completion of the operation.

The researchers found no significant differences in best-corrected visual acuity. Patients who had the dropless protocol had a higher incidence of cystoid macular edema — 5% vs 1% — Yousef said, but the incidence of ocular hypertension was not statistically significant between the two groups (2% vs 1%). A multivariate regression analysis showed the dropless protocol was not associated with increased risks for either complication, he added.

The dropless protocol has three key potential advantages over the traditional approach, Yousef said: Convenience for patients, improved drug bioavailability, and lower cost.

“The traditional drop protocol requires patients to administer three different medications four times daily over a 4-week tapering period,” he told Medscape Medical News. “This regimen results in a total of 12 drops per day for one eye and 210 drops over the course of the taper.”

Poor drug bioavailability is a “significant concern” with topical drops, Yousef said, because the epithelial membrane of the cornea can limit the ability of the drops from penetrating into the eye. “Intracameral injection bypasses these barriers, delivering a more direct treatment,” he said.

A 2020 analysis of Medicare claims reported the average cost of medications for eye drops after cataract surgery was $228 per eye. “Notably, 76.5% of this total cost was attributed to the use of brand-name medications,” Yousef said. “In contrast, the dropless approach costs just $15.91 per eye when a single vial is used for approximately 10 cases.”

The new data are important because few randomized clinical trials have compared the dropless and traditional protocols for treating pain and inflammation and preventing infections after cataract surgery, according to Neal Shorstein, MD, a retired cataract surgeon with Kaiser Permanente in Northern California.

“There are an accumulating number of observational studies, so this adds to the retrospective, observational literature, and that's a good thing because different locations and practice environments add to the experience,” said Shorstein, an adviser to the Seva Foundation, a nonprofit group that develops eye care programs in underserved regions.

The doses of medication used in the dropless protocol in the analysis are higher than what others have reported. The 0.2 mL of intracameral moxifloxacin 0.5% is “about the upper limits of what you want to inject of moxifloxacin.” The 0.5-mL dose of subconjunctival triamcinolone is, “in my estimation, a good dose.”

The formulation of triamcinolone used has a large particle size, which “matters a lot because the safety and effectiveness of triamcinolone depends on the particle size,” he said. Triesence, another formulation of triamcinolone used in some dropless protocols, has a smaller particle size, he said.

The entry point on the conjunctiva for the triamcinolone injection is another important factor, Shorstein added. “Our findings show that 6-8 mm from the limbus is the optimal location,” he said.

The study was independently supported. Yousef and Shorstein reported having no relevant financial relationships.

A research team at The University of Osaka has identified a crucial brain region involved in motor learning during reaching movements. The parvocellular division of the red nucleus, a small but specialized structure in the midbrain, was found to generate and transmit ""error signals"" necessary for adapting hand movements. This discovery clarifies a long-standing question in neuroscience about how the brain detects and corrects motion inaccuracies, with potential applications in developing new rehabilitation methods.

Adaptation in motor control, such as correcting errors when reaching for an object, is fundamental to daily activities. While the cerebellum has long been known to play a role in such learning, the origin of the instructive error signals had remained unclear. The red nucleus, divided into magnocellular (RNm) and parvocellular (RNp) regions, is a subcortical structure historically associated with movement coordination, but the function of RNp has been less understood. Researchers aimed to determine whether this region might be involved in signaling movement errors to the cerebellum.

In macaque monkeys, researchers discovered that a tiny brain region called the parvocellular red nucleus (RNp) sends ""error signals"" needed to correct reaching movements. These signals come in two forms—one during movement, and one after. When RNp was electrically stimulated just after a reach, the monkeys gradually changed their movement direction, showing learning over time. Stimulating a nearby region (RNm) had no effect, proving RNp's unique role in motor learning.

This research reveals for the first time that the parvocellular red nucleus acts as a central hub for motor error detection and correction, mediating motor learning through its connection to the cerebellum. The findings open new avenues for developing rehabilitation technologies targeting precise brain regions to aid recovery in patients with motor impairments due to stroke or injury. As Shigeru Kitazawa, lead author of the study remarks, ""Improving motor skills depends on our ability to detect and correct errors. Identifying how and where the brain performs could also lead to better ways to understand and treat rare brain diseases that make it hard for people to move or control their body properly.""

A combination of two drugs could improve outcomes and reduce the need for toxic chemotherapy for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), the commonest cancer in childhood and one that can be particularly difficult to treat in older patients, according to Cambridge scientists.

Although the research has so far only been conducted in cell lines and mice, the team is seeking funding to begin clinical trials in patients shortly.

More than 500 people a year in the UK are diagnosed with B-ALL, many of whom are children, where it makes up 40% of all childhood cancers. Although the disease is curable in the majority of younger patients, the treatment requires over two years of chemotherapy, leaving the patient susceptible to infections and experiencing toxic side effects including bruising and bleeding, hair loss, nausea and vomiting, as well as potential long-term damage notably to nerves, joints and the heart. Outcomes tend to be much poorer for older children and adults.

Every week, I see adult patients who are undergoing treatment for this incredibly aggressive form of leukemia, and although the chemotherapy can cure many of them, the side effects are often really challenging. We need to find treatments that are kinder and more effective.""

Dr. Simon Richardson from the Cambridge Stem Cell Institute and Department of Hematology, University of Cambridge

In recent years, new treatments have begun to emerge, including bone marrow transplants and immunotherapies such as CAR-T cell therapy, but these also come with significant side effects and are expensive.

Now, in research published today in Nature Communications, a team led by Dr Richardson and colleague Professor Brian Huntly has developed a new treatment with the potential to be less toxic than current treatment and to be effective in all age groups.

B-ALL is characterised by malignancies of early-stage B-cells. These are cells produced in our bone marrow that play an important role in our immune systems, producing antibodies to protect us from infection. However, in B-ALL, the body produces an overabundance of these cells that build up in our bone marrow and stop healthy blood cells from developing. They can also spread to other parts of the body.

""There's a constant stream of these cells coming out through the bone marrow into the immune system,"" said Dr Richardson. ""The ones that cause cancer are very primitive and not yet useful. They build up in the bone marrow and then often move around the body, such as invading into the brain where they can hide from chemotherapy. It's a really nasty kind of cancer.""

Treatments for B-ALL focus on killing these malignant B-cells. The approach being trialled by the team at the Cambridge Stem Cell Institute involves the use of two oral drugs in tandem, venetoclax and inobrodib.

Venetoclax is already used to treat a related condition, acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It works by targeting the protein BCL2 within the B-cells, causing them to die through a process of 'programmed cell death' known as apoptosis. However, venetoclax is not consistently effective in B-ALL.

The team was studying another gene called CREBBP, certain mutations of which contribute to disease progression and are also associated with resistance to chemotherapy in B-ALL. They found that when CREBBP is switched off, it leads to a rewiring of the fat metabolism of B-cells. When BCL2 activity is subsequently inhibited – for example by using venetoclax – it leads to cell death, but by a completely different process known as ferroptotic programmed cell death. This is where the cells are no longer able to protect themselves against damage to the fats in their membranes, causing the cells to become overwhelmed and break down.

The researchers used a new drug called inobrodib, developed by CellCentric, a University of Cambridge spinout company, to switch off CREBBP in human and mouse models of B-ALL. Combining it with venetoclax potently killed early-stage B-cells, even those cells that carried a genetic mutation making them resistant to venetoclax treatment alone.

Professor Brian Huntly, also from the Cambridge Stem Cell Institute and Head of the Department of Haematology, said: ""These are very promising findings, and even though our work was only in mice, we're optimistic that we will see similar effects in patients. Venetoclax and inobrodib have already been used together in an early-stage clinical trial for AML, so we know they are safe to use. We now want to trial our approach in adults and teenagers with B-ALL.""

B-cells are a vital part of the immune system, and although this drug combination will destroy the cells while the patient is on treatment, the body should begin producing them again once treatment is stopped. This makes this approach potentially much safer than CAR-T cell therapy, for example, which can permanently eradicate the body's ability to produce B-cells.

Dr. Richardson, who is also a Fellow at St. Catharine's College, Cambridge, added: ""The good news is that the cost of venetoclax is expected to fall in coming years with the introduction of generic alternatives, making its use much more cost effective.""

Professor Huntly and Dr Richardson are Honorary Consultant Hematologists at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. Professor Huntly is Chair of the Haematology Service at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

The research was largely funded by Cancer Research UK and Leukemia UK.

The University of Cambridge and Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust (ACT) are fundraising for a new hospital that will transform how we diagnose and treat cancer. Cambridge Cancer Research Hospital, a partnership with Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, will treat patients across the East of England, but the research that takes place there promises to change the lives of cancer patients across the UK and beyond. .

Gill Murphy was on extended maternity leave, aged 42, and her daughter had just turned two when her friend convinced her to speak to her GP about feeling excessively tired.

""I'm very pale anyway, thanks to my Irish Heritage, but the GP thought I look particularly pale,"" she says, ""so she ordered a blood test. She thought it might be low iron or anaemia.""

It turned out to be far more serious – Gill would be diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). She went into hospital in August 2013 for what she assumed would be an overnight stay. It turned out to be five-and-a-half weeks of chemotherapy.

Prior to her treatment, Gill had been a biomedical researcher studying tumour-suppressing proteins before becoming a programme manager at the Medical Research Council. She knew all about clinical trials – including the fact that patients on trials seem to fare better even when receiving only the placebo – and so requested she join one. She was enrolled onto a trial at the Royal Marsden Hospital, one of the UK's leading cancer hospitals, where she received treatment.

Gill was given chemotherapy alongside rituximab, a trial immunotherapy drug. Chemo drugs can attack every part of your body, not just the cancer. The side effects were terrible, she says, from vomiting and diarrhoea (giving way to horrific constipation) to migraines, hair loss and fatigue. Because she was immunosuppressed, she was unable at times to see her daughter, who developed infections after just starting nursery.

After her first round of chemo, Gill would come home for a week before returning to hospital for more treatment in an ongoing cycle, giving countless blood samples, bone marrow biopsies and lumbar puncture tests and receiving regular chemotherapy into her spine. (The one bright spot, she says, was the steroid dexamethasone, which ""can make you feel an awful lot better than you should. So, while my husband was trying to cope with everything at home, with our two-year-old and short working days, I was busy planning a kitchen extension from my hospital bed and overwhelming him with my plans!"")

Because of the genetics underlying her leukemia, her medical team recommended a stem cell transplant. With her background in medical research, she knew this was a risky procedure and that she could die as result of the transplant or her blood cancer relapsing – and that even if successful, it was going to make her very ill.

""I'd been quite stoic when I was first diagnosed. I treated it as a project, like, 'Right, you've got to get rid of this cancer'. The longer it went on, the more scared I got. There were a lot of sleepless nights, when I just got out of bed and went and had a cup of hot milk with the nurses. It was really hard.""

The treatments Gill received in preparation for the donor stem cell transplant were particularly harsh, she says, probably the worst she felt through the entire process. And then after the treatment, she had to take immunosuppressants to prevent the stem cells turning her immune system against her. There were frequent trips back to the hospital because she was unable to keep food down. She was constantly freezing, wearing layers of coats and cardigans and blankets and a bobble hat at night.

""I remember lying in bed looking through the blinds when I was at home and marking the days by looking at how late the streetlights were coming on, because I was thinking, 'Every day I'm going to get a bit better'.""

It worked: the transplant was a success and Gill's leukemia is now in remission.

""I was very lucky. I had a really, really good donor match. I still don't know who my donor is, but I'm so grateful to them for signing up to do something so altruistic. There's no doubt that they saved my life.""

Even so, Gill's life has not returned to normal. It has become what many cancer survivors describe as a ""new normal"". She is still affected by fatigue – not tiredness, but rather a sense of ""hitting a wall"" if she pushes herself too hard (though she says she can ""sleep for every country in the world, not just for England""). Other later side effects have included early menopause, steroid-induced diabetes, cataracts, osteomyelitis in both lower legs and a susceptibility to infections. She believes her cognition and memory have also taken a hit.

Yet despite this, Gill has found a new life as an ambassador for Blood Cancer UK, talking to other patients, researchers and politicians about ALL, sitting on interview panels for the charity, advising on its five-year strategy, and many more tasks.

""We [cancer survivors] all say we want to give something back, but it's true. I've gained more from being involved with Blood Cancer UK as an ambassador than anything I've ever done before.""

She has also taken on walking challenges to raise money for Blood Cancer UK, Anthony Nolan and the Royal Marsden: three charities that have helped her immensely over the years.

Gill says that despite how terrible her treatment was, she knows that others have experienced much worse. But she is also keen to stress that in the 12 years since her treatment, things have improved and there are better treatments now available.

""The doctors I meet all want to see kinder, more targeted treatments,"" she says. ""Anything that we can do to improve treatments so more people can survive their blood cancer and fewer people have to go through incredibly harsh therapies is a win-win."".

Physical activity helps protect older adults against disease. A new study reveals that the health benefits also apply to those who exercise less than the recommended amount.

""The results show that all exercise is important for the health of older adults,"" says Andreas Nilsson, a sports science researcher at örebro University, who conducted the study with fellow örebro researcher Fawzi Kadi.

Researchers observed 871 individuals aged 65 to 79 from Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom.

One group included individuals classified as physically active, exercising at least the recommended 2.5 hours per week with pulse-raising activities. The other group consisted of individuals who did not meet this exercise recommendation and were therefore classified as physically inactive.

We used activity trackers to measure how much time the participants spent doing daily activities of varying intensity. This method provides much more reliable results than letting the participants report how much they exercise themselves, which is the method most commonly used in previous research.""

Andreas Nilsson, sports science researcher at örebro University

For one week, participants kept a diary of what they ate and were given points based on how well they followed dietary guidelines for older adults.

Research teams in European countries took participants' waist measurements and blood samples to analyse five biomarkers that identify metabolic syndrome, a collective term for conditions such as elevated blood fat levels, high blood pressure, blood sugar and insulin resistance. All of these can be linked to an increased risk of disease.

The results showed that participants who were sedentary for less than 8.3 hours per day had a significantly lower risk of metabolic syndrome, regardless of their physical activity or dietary habits.

""We found that, even among those who didn't meet the recommended physical activity guidelines, being less sedentary was associated with better health. This suggests that even light exercise is good for your health,"" concluded Andreas Nilsson.

The lowest risk of metabolic diseases was found in individuals who were both physically active, i.e. exercised for more than 2.5 hours per week, and at the same time sat the least.

As people age, their immune systems become less efficient, posing a challenge for cancer therapies that rely on harnessing immune cells. In a new study published in Nature Cancer, researchers from the University of Lausanne (UNIL), the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) and the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), show that this age-related immune decline has a measurable impact on CAR-T cell therapy, one of the most advanced forms of cancer immunotherapy.

CAR-T therapy works by engineering a patient's T cells to recognize and destroy cancer cells. But the study found that CAR-T cells from aged mice had poor mitochondrial function, lower ""stemness"", and reduced antitumor activity. The culprit: a drop in levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a molecule essential for cellular energy and metabolism of mitochondria.

CAR-T cells from older individuals are metabolically impaired and significantly less effective. What's exciting is that we were able to rejuvenate these aged cells by restoring their NAD levels-reviving their antitumor function in preclinical models.""

Dr. Helen Carrasco Hope, first author 

""Our findings strengthen the growing recognition that aging fundamentally reshapes immune cell function and metabolism,"" she added. ""They highlight the urgent need to model age more accurately in preclinical studies, so that therapies are developed with the real-world cancer population in mind-where most patients are older adults.""

The team used NAD-boosting compounds currently under clinical investigation for other conditions, demonstrating that this approach is translatable and potentially applicable in humans. ""This is a major step toward personalized and age-conscious immunotherapy,"" said senior author Dr. Nicola Vannini. ""By correcting age-related metabolic defects, we could improve outcomes for a large segment of cancer patients.""

The study adds to a growing body of work showing that age is not just a chronological number, but a biological factor that can shape therapy response. The authors call for age to be systematically considered in the development and evaluation of cell-based immunotherapies.

When a person remembers their friend telling them a funny story, they associate the sound of that friend talking with the appearance of that friend speaking and laughing. How does the human brain form audiovisual memories like this? In a new JNeurosci paper, Emmanuel Biau, from the University of Liverpool, and colleagues addressed this question by exploring brain activity linked to forming memories that integrate sounds and visual information. 

The researchers elicited memories in study participants by presenting them with movie clips of people speaking. They manipulated when sounds and visual information were presented in the movie clips to explore the impact on brain activity during memory recall. Movie clips with speech sounds and lip movements occurring at the same time were linked to oscillatory activity in two brain regions during viewing of the clips. This oscillatory activity reoccurred when participants remembered the movie clips later. But movie clips with speech sounds lagging behind lip movements reduced oscillatory activity during viewing as well as during memory recall.

Says Biau, ""We assume that if auditory and visual speech inputs arrive in the brain at the same time, then their chance of being associated in a memory is much higher because they will fall into the same phase of neural activity, which is not the case for asynchronous stimuli.""

According to the authors, their work suggests that the oscillatory activity in these two brain regions may play a crucial role in integrating auditory and visual information during memory recall, though more work is needed to confirm this.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New AI model assesses eczema severity using smartphone images","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250520/New-AI-model-assesses-eczema-severity-using-smartphone-images.aspx","Tue, 20 May 2025 16:36:00 GMT","

A team of researchers from Keio University School of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, and Teikyo University, in collaboration with Atopiyo LLC, has developed a novel artificial intelligence (AI) model that can objectively assess eczema severity using smartphone images uploaded by patients. Their findings were recently published in Allergy, the official journal of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic skin condition that flares repeatedly and often requires long-term monitoring and treatment adjustments. In recent years, smartphone apps and social media platforms have made it easier for patients to track their symptoms, learn about their condition, and document changes over time. However, patient-reported symptoms like itch or sleep loss don't always align with visible disease severity. This gap underscores the need for more standardized, objective evaluation tools-and highlights the growing potential of digital biomarkers to fill that role.

To address this, the research team leveraged data from Atopiyo, Japan's largest AD platform, where over 28,000 users have shared more than 57,000 symptom photos and personal comments since 2018. The AI model developed in this study integrates three key algorithms: body part detection, eczema lesion detection, and severity scoring using the Three Item Severity (TIS) scale, which evaluates redness, swelling, and excoriation.

Using a training dataset of 880 images with self-reported itch scores, the AI model demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy. In a validation study using 220 test images, the AI-based TIS (AI-TIS) showed a strong correlation with dermatologist-assessed TIS scores (R = 0.73, P < 0.001) and a meaningful correlation with objective SCORAD scores (R = 0.53, P = 0.04).

Many patients with eczema struggle to evaluate their disease severity on their own. Our AI model allows for objective, real-time tracking using just a smartphone, empowering patients and potentially improving disease management.""

Dr. Takeya Adachi, study's corresponding author

Interestingly, the study also found that AI-derived severity scores correlated only weakly with self-reported itch scores, highlighting the discrepancy between perceived symptoms and observable inflammation. This supports the growing need for digital biomarkers that can enhance precision in dermatological care.

The researchers aim to expand the model's utility by incorporating broader skin types, age ranges, and integrating additional clinical features from scoring systems like SCORAD and EASI. This work paves the way for AI-driven teledermatology solutions that support both patients and clinicians in real-world settings.

A new study led by researchers at Tulane University suggests that people with high blood pressure can significantly reduce - and possibly eliminate - their increased risk of premature death by controlling several key health risk factors at once.

The study, published in Precision Clinical Medicine, tracked more than 70,000 people with hypertension and over 224,000 without it, using data from the UK Biobank. Researchers followed participants for nearly 14 years to understand how managing these risk factors affected early mortality - defined as dying before age 80.

The eight health risk factors evaluated in the study include: blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, LDL ""bad"" cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, smoking status and physical activity. Notably, researchers found that hypertensive patients who had addressed at least four of these risk factors had no greater risk of an early death than those without high blood pressure.

Our study shows that controlling blood pressure is not the only way to treat hypertensive patients, because high blood pressure can affect these other factors. By addressing the individual risk factors, we can help prevent early death for those with hypertension.""

Dr. Lu Qi, corresponding author, HCA Regents Distinguished Chair and professor of epidemiology in the Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University

Hypertension, defined as a blood pressure of 130 mmHg or higher, is the leading preventable risk factor for premature death worldwide.

The study found that addressing each additional risk factor was associated with a 13% lower risk of early death, 12% lower risk of early death due to cancer and 21% lower risk of death due to cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of premature death globally.

""Optimal risk control"" – having 7 or more of the risk factors addressed – was linked to 40% less risk of early death, 39% less risk of early death due to cancer and 53% less risk of early death due to cardiovascular disease.

""To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the association between controlling joint risk factors and premature mortality in patients with hypertension,"" Qi said. ""Importantly, we found that any hypertension-related excess risk of an early death could be entirely eliminated by addressing these risk factors.""

Only 7% of hypertensive participants in the study had seven or more risk factors under control, highlighting a major opportunity for prevention. Researchers say the findings underscore the importance of personalized, multifaceted care - not just prescribing medication for blood pressure, but addressing a broader range of health behaviors and conditions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Breakthrough microimager offers new possibilities for internal imaging","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250519/Breakthrough-microimager-offers-new-possibilities-for-internal-imaging.aspx","Tue, 20 May 2025 01:48:00 GMT","

Researchers have developed an extremely thin, flexible imager that could be useful for noninvasively acquiring images from inside the body. The new technology could one day enable early and precise disease detection, providing critical insights to guide timely and effective treatment.

As opposed to existing prohibitively large endoscopes made of cameras and optical lenses or bulky fiber optic bundles, our microimager is very compact. Much thinner than a typical eyelash, our device is ideal to reach deep regions of the body without causing significant damage to the tissue.""

Maysam Chamanzar, research team leader from Carnegie Mellon University

In the Optica Publishing Group journal Biomedical Optics Express, the researchers showed that the microimager, which is only 7 microns thick - a 10th of an eyelash diameter - and about 10 mm long, can be used in a mouse brain for structural and functional imaging of brain activity. The width of the thin film imager can be customized based on the desired field of view and resolution.

""With further development, the microimager could be implanted for short- or long-term imaging or attached to catheters to image internal body parts like the gastrointestinal tract or inside of blood vessels,"" said Chamanzar. ""It could also be used with surgical tools to provide real-time visual feedback to surgeons to improve the surgical outcome and reduce the chance of adverse effects.""

The miniaturized endoscope is based on a flexible photonic platform that uses the biocompatible transparent polymer Parylene to create photonic components such as waveguides. The researchers originally developed Parylene photonics to create miniaturized implantable devices that provide targeted light delivery in tissue.

In the new work, the researchers used the bidirectional capability of Parylene waveguides, which can both deliver and detect light, to create an array of waveguides designed for imaging tissue structure and function. They designed a microimager with waveguides that each have a micromirror at both ends. One or more of the waveguides deliver light to illuminate the tissue while backscattered light is collected by the micromirrors, coupled into other individual waveguides and transmitted to the back end. There, the light is projected onto an image sensor array. With this design, each waveguide effectively relays a pixel of the tissue image.

 ""We made the miniaturized endoscope using microscale fabrication techniques similar to those used in microelectronics and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS),"" said M. Hassan Malekoshoaraie, the doctoral student who designed and demonstrated these endoscopic imagers. ""This allows the waveguides and micromirrors to be easily customized for imaging various tissues with the desired resolution.""

To demonstrate the miniaturized endoscope, the researchers first showed that it can image fluorescent microspheres embedded within a scattering medium, enabling 3D localization of the microspheres. They then used the microimager to capture a fluorescent image of mouse brain tissue expressing green fluorescent protein. Finally, they demonstrated functional neural imaging from mouse brain tissue that expresses genetically encoded calcium indicators, demonstrating that the microimager can capture neural function.

 ""We validated the functional optical images obtained using our endoscopes using by comparing with ground truth electrophysiology recording,"" said Vishal Jain, a neuroscientist on the research team. ""Observing such a strong correspondence between the imaging data and electrophysiology was encouraging.""

The researchers say that this work is one step toward their overarching goal of imaging neural tissue in action. ""We eventually want to be able to correlate neural activity to the transcriptional profile of specific cell types involved in the population activity,"" said Chamanzar.

Next, the researchers want to integrate light sources, image sensor arrays and filters into the device's back end to implement a fully integrated standalone microimager for in vivo applications. This could allow the microimager to be surgically implanted in tissue for applications such as imaging remnant cancer cells after tumor removal or monitoring disease progression after treatment.

It's a marvel of food technology: ice cream that resists melting.

In a video explaining the science behind it, a seller of food chemicals shows scoops of ice cream holding their shape under hot lights. The super ingredient? Polysorbate 80.

Polysorbate 80 is an emulsifier, a chemical used to control the consistency of thousands of supermarket products. Other widely used emulsifiers or stabilizers include carboxymethyl cellulose, carrageenan, and maltodextrin.

Recently, such ingredients have been showing up in scientific studies for another reason: Researchers say they may cause a variety of health problems.

Studies have found that emulsifiers can alter the mix of bacteria in the gut, known as the microbiome or microbiota; damage the lining of the gastrointestinal tract; and trigger inflammation, potentially contributing to problems elsewhere in the body.

Emulsifiers and stabilizers are among the most common ingredients in ultraprocessed foods, a prime target of the ""Make America Healthy Again"" campaign by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

They are on the department's radar: Their potentially harmful effects were flagged in a document HHS recently produced to support Kennedy's drive to eliminate petroleum-based food dyes.

But they illustrate the complexity of the war on food additives.

They show how, when it comes to food science, regulators are chronically playing catch-up. In the meantime, for many ingredients, regulators and consumers alike are left in a gray zone between suspicion and proof of harm in humans.

Emulsifiers' assault on the microbiome could help explain inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, metabolic disorders, and even cancer, the studies suggest.

""There is a lot of data showing that those compounds are really detrimental for the microbiota and that we should stop using them,"" said Benoit Chassaing, a research director at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research and a co-author of several related studies.

Yet much larger and more ambitious clinical trials in humans are needed, Chassaing added.

For Lewis Rands, who has suffered from gastrointestinal illness, the research fits his own experience as a consumer. Changing his diet to avoid emulsifiers has made a shocking difference, easing symptoms that were debilitating, Rands said.

""Clinically, many patients have reported an improvement in symptoms with such changes,"" said Ashwin Ananthakrishnan, a gastroenterologist and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital.

The scientific findings come with caveats. For instance, much of the research has been done in mice, or by mimicking the human gut in a tube. There are many unknowns. Not all emulsifiers have bad effects, or the same effects, and some people are thought to be much more vulnerable than others. Even some researchers who have co-authored papers say that the substances have not been proven harmful to humans and that it's too soon to say regulators should ban them.

Still, the research poses a challenge for the FDA.

When emulsifiers began spreading through the food supply, the agency wasn't focusing on the gut microbiome, a relatively recent scientific frontier, researchers said.

Martin Makary, appointed by President Donald Trump to head the FDA, mentioned the microbiome at his Senate confirmation hearing in March. Though he didn't cite emulsifiers specifically or identify chemicals by name, he said substances that affect the microbiome deserve the FDA's attention.

""There's a body of research now that suggests concern with some of these ingredients,"" he said. ""We have to look at those ingredients, and you have my commitment to do so if confirmed as FDA commissioner.""

""These chemicals are creating an inflammatory response in the gastrointestinal tract, and with an altered microbiome lining that GI tract, kids feel sick,"" he added.

The FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions about Makary's testimony.

However, when journalist Emily Kopp asked HHS for the science behind its recent announcement that it is phasing out petroleum-based food dyes, the agency provided a compilation of information on potentially harmful compounds commonly found in ultraprocessed foods. The document, which appeared to be a draft, included a section on emulsifiers, such as xanthan gum and carrageenan. It noted that the section needed more work.

HHS subsequently provided the document to KFF Health News.

As far back as 2020, an international organization for the study of inflammatory bowel diseases advised that, for people with those conditions, it ""may be prudent to limit intake"" of maltodextrin, carrageenan, carboxymethyl cellulose, and polysorbate 80.

Emulsifiers are developed from a variety of sources, including plants and bacteria.

Some ingredients that might affect the microbiome show up in foods because they were deemed ""generally recognized as safe,"" or GRAS.

""New information may at any time require reconsideration of the GRAS status of a food ingredient,"" the Code of Federal Regulations says.

Rands, a genetic scientist, took matters into his own hands to battle severe inflammatory bowel disease. The illness caused bloating, stomach pain, cramps, frequent bowel movements, and bleeding, he said. It left him in a constant state of anxiety and stress, he added, wondering where the nearest bathroom was and whether he'd reach it in time.

Even taking a walk around the block with his wife and baby near their home in Australia was problematic.

Then, on the advice of a dietitian, Rands began avoiding foods with emulsifiers: chemicals such as carboxymethyl cellulose, carrageenan, guar gum, xanthan gum, and maltodextrin — plus other additives.

For instance, instead of eating Ben & Jerry's ice cream, he switched to Häagen-Dazs ice cream that is free of the substances at issue.

The relief was dramatic.

""It's a huge difference,"" Rands said. ""To me, it's made more of a difference than any drug.""

He has been able to scale back or stop taking several drugs, which is an added relief — not least because some can have harmful side effects, and, he said, one was taking its toll.

Rands said he used a scientific approach, isolating variables in his diet and logging the results. Avoiding artificial sweeteners helps, he said, but most of the benefit relates to avoiding the emulsifiers.

Ben & Jerry's did not respond to a request for comment.

The Consumer Brands Association, which represents makers of processed foods, stands behind use of the chemicals.

""Food safety and protecting the integrity of the food supply is priority number one for the makers of America's food and beverage products,"" Sarah Gallo, the group's senior vice president of product policy, said in a statement.

""Emulsifiers and thickening agents play an important role in improving food texture and consistency, and have been studied by the FDA through a rigorous scientific and risk-based process,"" Gallo said.

Asked for specifics on how the FDA had analyzed potential effects on the microbiome, the group did not respond.

Chassaing said the chemicals were ""never considered for the potential effect on the microbiota.”

Robert Califf, who led the FDA under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, said in an interview that scientists are just beginning to understand the microbiome. He compared it to where the field of genomics was 20 years ago, only much more complicated — ""multiplied by a thousand dimensions.""

He said the substances ""fell within the standards"" when they were greenlighted. ""But hopefully most people agree that the standards need to be upgraded,"" he added.

""This is different than traditional food safety thinking about, 'Does it cause an immediate problem?'"" Califf said. ""We're talking about long-term health outcomes here.""

And has the FDA evaluated those?

""How could it? There was no way to do it,"" Califf said. The answers will vary depending on the emulsifier, and ""proving whether it's bad or good is going to require rigorous science that hasn't been done yet.""

More recent scientific capabilities expand the possibilities, he said.

For a consumer, trying to steer clear of emulsifiers can be difficult. Without realizing it, people can consume a variety of emulsifiers from a variety of foods — and the same chemicals from multiple sources.

Polysorbate 80 was listed as an ingredient on the labels of 2,311 products as of May 12, according to an online database posted by the Environmental Working Group using information from NielsenIQ. Carrageenan was listed on 8,100 product labels; maltodextrin, 12,769; and xanthan gum, 17,153.

Some emulsifiers have multiple names, making them harder to recognize. Some names can apply to more than one emulsifier. And some chemical names that appear on product labels don't appear in the FDA's ""Substances Added to Food"" inventory.

Carboxymethyl cellulose — not to be confused with methyl cellulose — is also known as carboxymethylcellulose and cellulose gum. Maltodextrin can be derived from substances such as cornstarch, rice starch, and wheat starch — but the FDA doesn't consider it synonymous with the term ""modified food starch.""

The naming practices can frustrate efforts to track the chemicals in food, to measure how much of the stuff people are taking in, and even to figure out precisely which chemicals a scientific study evaluated, researchers said.

""There's a lot of confusion in the field,"" said Christine McDonald, a researcher at the Cleveland Clinic who has studied maltodextrin. She called for more consistent naming of additives in the United States.

The very term ""emulsifier"" is problematic. By strict definition, emulsifiers create an emulsion — a stable blend of liquids that would not otherwise mix, such as oil and water. However, the term is used broadly, encompassing chemicals such as maltodextrin that thicken, stabilize, or alter texture.

Emulsifiers can be found in foods marketed as natural or healthy as well as ones that look artificial. Some products contain multiple emulsifiers.

Products sold at Whole Foods, for instance, list a variety of emulsifiers on their labels. 365 brand Organic Vegan Ranch Dressing & Dip contained organic tapioca maltodextrin and xanthan gum. Pacific Seafood Starfish brand Cornmeal Crusted Fishsticks — marked as wild-caught and MSC-certified (sustainably sourced) — contain guar gum. Flour tortillas by 365 included monoglycerides of fatty acids and ""stabilizer (guar gum, xanthan gum, carrageenan).""

At a Safeway supermarket, Healthy Choice Grilled Chicken Pesto With Vegetables listed modified potato starch, modified corn starch, carrageenan, xanthan gum, and guar gum.

The label on Newman's Own Caesar salad dressing said the product contained no artificial preservatives or flavors, no colors from an artificial source, and was gluten-free. The ingredient label listed, ""as a thickener,"" xanthan gum.

In response to questions for this article, Whole Foods Market said it prohibits more than 300 ingredients commonly found in food. ""Our experts evaluate ingredients for acceptability in all food products we sell based on the best available scientific research,"" the company said in a statement provided by spokesperson Rachel Malish.

Safeway's parent company, Albertsons Companies, did not respond to inquiries. Nor did Pacific Seafood, Newman's Own, or Conagra Brands, which makes Healthy Choice.

Research on emulsifiers has been building in recent years.

For example, a study published in January by the Journal of Crohn's and Colitis concluded that a diet low in emulsifiers is an effective treatment for mild or moderate Crohn's disease. The eight-week clinical trial, which tracked 154 patients in the United Kingdom, focused on carrageenan, carboxymethyl cellulose, and polysorbate 80.

A study published in February 2024 in the journal PLOS Medicine found that higher intakes of carrageenan and mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids were associated with higher risks of cancer. The study observed 92,000 French adults for an average of 6.7 years.

A study published in September 2023 in The BMJ, formerly known as the British Medical Journal, found that intake of several types of emulsifiers was associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease. The study observed more than 95,000 French adults for a median of 7.4 years.

A series of earlier studies found that emulsifiers ""can promote chronic intestinal inflammation in mice""; that two in particular, carboxymethyl cellulose and polysorbate 80, ""profoundly impact intestinal microbiota in a manner that promotes gut inflammation and associated disease states""; and that, based on a laboratory study of human samples, ""numerous, but not all, commonly used emulsifiers can directly alter gut microbiota in a manner expected to promote intestinal inflammation,"" as recounted in a 2021 paper in the journal Microbiome.

Other findings diverge.

A study from Australia, published in February in Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, followed 24 Crohn's patients over four weeks and concluded that, in the context of a healthy diet, the emulsifier content had ""no influence over disease activity.""

Authors declared conflicts of interest, including payments from PepsiCo, drug companies, and Mindset Health Pty, which promotes hypnosis-based therapy.

One of the authors, gastroenterology professor Peter Gibson of Monash University in Australia, said the conflicts of interest ""have nothing whatsoever to do with the study.""

""It is important not to overinterpret results of studies,"" he said, adding that his team's report ""does not mean that emulsifiers are good for you or that there are no health benefits in avoiding emulsifiers.""

Häagen-Dazs touts the absence of such chemicals as a virtue.

""Keeping it real, the way it should be,"" it said in an online plug for its vanilla ice cream. ""No emulsifiers. No stabilizers.""

However, at the company that makes Häagen-Dazs in the United States, Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, there are limits to that approach.

Under other brand names — such as Edy's, Dreyer's, and Drumstick — it markets products that contain emulsifiers or stabilizers. The company did not respond to questions. In addition, a spokesperson for Nestlé, which markets Drumstick and Häagen-Dazs brands internationally, did not respond.

Drumstick Vanilla Caramel Sundae Cones have no artificials flavors or colors, the package says — but they feature an array of other ingredients, including soy lecithin, guar gum, monogylcerides, and carob bean gum.

The cones, the company's website says, offer ""one incredibly creamy experience.""

And the creamy filling doesn't melt.

Instead, over 24 hours on a KFF Health News reporter's kitchen counter, it bled a caramel-tinged fluid and shrank into a sticky white foam that could be cut with a knife.

Premature infants are at risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or BPD, a type of lung injury associated with increased mortality. Now a new study published at the ATS 2025 International Conference shows that ciliary dynamics may play a role in the pathophysiology of this disease.

Researchers found that infants with more severe BPD showed signs of ciliary dysfunction that were not present in those with moderate disease. It's the first study to examine the link between BPD and cilia, tiny hairlike structures that help clear the airways of mucus and pathogens.

Ciliary dynamics have never really been studied before in BPD, and we found they can have a significant impact on the pathophysiology.""

Daniel A. Yassa, MD, first author, pediatric pulmonologist at UT Health Houston

BPD is a type of chronic lung injury that can occur in premature infants as a result of barotrauma and oxygen injury. Existing therapies focus on protecting the functional tissues of the lungs, airway management, and managing vascular complications. However, the impact of ciliary function and the ability of cilia to clear mucus hasn't been understood.

Cilia work by ""beating,"" or moving in coordinated pulses to propel mucus out of the body. Dysfunctional mucociliary clearance is known to be linked to recurrent infections and progressive lung damage, Dr. Yassa noted.

For the new, retrospective study, researchers used high-speed video microscopy to observe nasal samples from nine infants with BPD, analyzing four recordings for each patient. The team found a distinct reduction in the angle and amplitude of cilia beats in patients with severe BPD, compared to those with more moderate disease.

The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms that influence BPD severity and point to a potential role of mucociliary clearance in the development of the disease, Dr. Yassa said.

""This potentially allows us to have a better understanding of the disease process, which can affect all aspects of clinical care,"" he said. The findings could potentially point to new therapeutic targets, help classify BPD diagnoses, or lead to other advances in managing BPD.

Next, the researchers hope to continue with follow-up studies.

""Future research with larger cohorts and advanced imaging modalities is warranted to further elucidate the implications of ciliary dynamics and physical properties on clinical outcomes in patients with BPD,"" he added.

The new guidelines for the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) published in Neurodegenerative Diseases, serve as exemplary clinical recommendations for clinicians and healthcare providers, supporting the advancement of Alzheimer's disease treatment in Switzerland.

The Swiss Memory Clinics (SMC) network, a group of specialized clinics in Switzerland that diagnose and treat patients with dementia, has released new national guidelines on the use of anti-amyloid mAbs – such as Lecanemab and Donanemab – for treating Alzheimer's disease in Switzerland. Lecanemab is now also authorized by the European Commission under strict conditions.

Published in the 11 April 2025 issue of Neurodegenerative Diseases, a Karger journal, the paper represents a coordinated effort by the SMC network to ensure safe, effective, and ethical implementation of these emerging therapies. Serving as a clinical practice guide for clinicians and healthcare providers, it facilitates the implementation of emerging treatment options in the field of Alzheimer's disease.

The paper outlines criteria for patient selection, biomarker confirmation, APOE genotyping, ARIA monitoring via MRI, and the infrastructure required to support safe treatment delivery. It also emphasizes the importance of informed consent and recommends the creation of a national patient registry.

The guidelines stem from interdisciplinary discussions between clinicians in the SMC network--neurologists, geriatricians, old-age psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, neuroradiologists, and patient organizations, including representatives of academic and non-academic memory clinics--between August 2023 and December 2024. They provide the first country-specific framework for integrating mAbs into clinical practice.

In a joint statement, lead authors Dr. med Ansgar Felbecker and Professor Giovanni B. Frisoni, commented: “We built an expert group of specialists to provide recommendations in Switzerland on when to use anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies in the care of Alzheimer's disease patients. Our hope is that this guidance will help with the approval of these new drugs in other countries for patients who qualify for this care.”

While the paper provides a country-specific framework for the use of mAbs in clinical routine, the authors hope that as Alzheimer's disease care enters a new therapeutic era, these guidelines can balance innovation with clinical responsibility—offering a model for other nations navigating similar questions.

It is great that the journal Neurodegenerative Diseases serves as a home for such important guidance that has the potential to impact thousands of patients,”

Professor Gilles Allali, Editor in Chief of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Karger Publishers

“The latest guidelines put forward by Swiss experts truly have the potential to transform Alzheimer's disease care across the globe.”

Food cravings are the downfall of many dieters, who feel locked in an eternal battle with their willpower to resist the tempting sweets, snacks and other foods they love.

However, researchers in food science and human nutrition at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign say in a new study that eating dessert may be the optimal strategy for losing weight, keeping it off and keeping cravings at bay. Dieters in a clinical trial who incorporated craved foods into a balanced meal plan lost more weight during the 12-month weight-loss program and their cravings remained minimal through the subsequent 12 months of maintenance.

Then-graduate student Nouf W. Alfouzan and nutrition professor Manabu T. Nakamura, who published their findings in the journal Physiology and Behavior, said that dieters' food cravings decreased while losing weight and remained minimal as long as they did not regain weight. The participants were part of a larger project conducted with physicians at Carle Clinic in Urbana, Illinois, that aimed to broaden the outreach of an in-person weight-loss program called the Individualized Dietary Improvement Program by converting it to an online format called EMPOWER.

We recruited obese patients ages 18 to 75 who had comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes and could benefit from losing weight. Cravings are a big problem for many people. If they have a lot of cravings, it is very difficult to lose weight. Even when they are able to control their cravings and lose weight, if the cravings come back, they regain the weight.""

Manabu T. Nakamura, nutrition professor

Although many dieters reported in prior research that their cravings decreased while losing weight, Nakamura and Alfouzan said it remained unclear whether these changes persisted when they reached their weight-loss goal or quit dieting while trying to maintain their weight. Alfouzan, the first author of the current study, wanted to investigate that along with whether reduced cravings correlated with greater weight loss.

The dietary program used in the study educates dieters about key nutrients, helping them make informed decisions about their food selections until sustainable dietary changes are achieved, Nakamura said. Dieters used a data visualization tool that plots foods' protein, fiber and calories so they can enhance nutrition while minimizing the calories they consume.

During the first year, participants engaged in 22 online nutrition education sessions created by scholars at the university's Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning that included strategies for dealing with cravings.

""If you are eating and snacking randomly, it's very hard to control,"" Nakamura said. ""Some dietary programs exclude certain foods. Our plan used an 'inclusion strategy,' in which people incorporated small portions of craved foods within a well-balanced meal.""

Every six months participants completed a questionnaire about their cravings for specific foods. These included high-fat foods such as hot dogs and fried chicken, fast food fats like hamburgers and chips, sweets such as cakes and cookies, and carbohydrates such as biscuits and pancakes.

The researchers also assessed the frequency and intensity of participants' cravings with another survey. Using a scale ranging from 1 (never) to 6 (always), individuals rated themselves on statements such as, ""Whenever I have food cravings, I find myself making plans to eat"" and ""I have no willpower to resist my food cravings."" The intensity of each dieter's cravings was calculated by adding their scores for all 15 statements.

Dieters also weighed in daily after getting out of bed and before breakfast using a Wi-Fi scale that transmitted the data to the researchers so they could track the changes.

A total of 30 people began the weight-loss program, and the 24 who remained at the end of the first year had lost an average of 7.9% of their starting weight. Of these, 20 people completed the yearlong maintenance program, but because a few regained some of what they had lost, their average weight loss was 6.7%, the researchers found.

Participants who lost more than 5% by the end of the study experienced consistent reductions in the frequency and intensity of their cravings while those who lost less than that did not. The team also found that individuals' craving for food in general and for specific types of foods such as sweets and carbohydrates diminished during the year of weight loss and stabilized during maintenance.

This finding suggests that individuals' reduced cravings correlated with decreased body fat rather than the negative energy balance of dieting, Nakamura said. ""This basically debunks the hungry fat cell theory, a longstanding hypothesis that fat cells become starved for energy and trigger cravings, causing dieters to eat and ultimately regain what they lost. But that is not the case. As long as you stay at a healthy weight, your cravings will remain low.""

Of the 24 participants who remained in the study at 12 months, more than half reported they used the inclusion strategy to manage cravings, some people as frequently as one to three times a day, while others used it once a week or more. Those who used the strategy lost significantly more weight compared with other participants and experienced significant reductions in their cravings for sweet and high-fat foods, the researchers found.

Consistency is another key to managing cravings and weight, Nakamura said. ""The popular myth is you have to have a very strong will to fend off temptation, but that is not the case. Fluctuations in eating patterns, meal times and amounts trigger cravings, too. You have to be consistent.""

A drug used to treat type 2 diabetes may also be effective in slowing the progression of prostate cancer. This is shown by an international study in which researchers at Umeå University, Sweden, have participated. The researchers have found that drugs that regulate a particular protein have a key role in reducing prostate cancer recurrence among diabetic patients.

This is a significant discovery. For the first time, we have clinical observations showing that prostate cancer patients with diabetes who received drugs targeting the protein remained relapse-free during the period we followed them.""

Lukas Kenner, visiting professor at Umeå University and one of the study's lead authors

The protein that the researchers have studied is called PPARy, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. In diabetes research, PPARy has been extensively studied in view of the protein's role in metabolic processes and insulin sensitivity.

What the research team, led by Professor Kenner, has now shown is that patients who were treated for prostate cancer and who also had diabetes, who were treated with drugs that regulate the PPARy protein, managed without recurrence of prostate cancer. In studies of cell cultures, researchers also observed that the drug in question, pioglitazone, not only inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells but also drives a metabolic reprogramming of the cancer cells, weakening their ability to grow.

""The findings are very promising, but further clinical studies are needed to both confirm the results and to investigate whether the treatment can also be used in patients with prostate cancer who do not have diabetes,"" says Lukas Kenner.

The research has been conducted as a combination of studies on cells and mice as well as a retrospective study of 69 prostate cancer patients with type 2 diabetes that was followed by the Medical University of Innsbruck in 2014–2023.

In certain types of cancer, PPARγ can contribute to tumor growth or metabolic changes. The drug, pioglitazone, is a so-called agonist that binds to a PPARy receptor and activates it. Thereby it modulates the signalling pathway and aims to counteract tumor-promoting effects by changing the cellular metabolism but may also reduce inflammation.

The research group behind the study includes researchers in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Sweden.

McKeown and USWNT will take on China PR and Jamaica in two friendly matches

Washington, D.C. (05/20/2025) – Washington Spirit defender Tara McKeown has been called up to the U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) for the side's May/June friendlies, U.S. Soccer announced today. The U.S. will take on China PR and Jamaica in two friendly matches beginning later this month. 

McKeown earns her fourth consecutive call-up to the U.S. senior team in just her third season at center back. Making her first appearance and start for the USWNT against Colombia in this year's SheBelieves Cup, McKeown also tallied her first international assist when she connected with Ally Sentnor for a second half goal. 

USWNT's May/June 2025 Friendly Schedule: 

McKeown moved from forward to defender after the 2022 season and has been a stalwart for the Spirit, having played over 3,000 consecutive regular season minutes for the team. An NWSL Defender of the Year finalist in 2024, the standout completed her first career Iron Woman season last year and tallied the late equalizer in the Spirit's NWSL quarterfinal match against Bay FC to force extra time and eventually send the Spirit to the semifinal round. 

The Spirit will take the pitch at Audi Field next on Sunday, June 8 when the side takes on the North Carolina Courage in the club's annual Juneteenth match. Single match tickets are available here. Fans can secure their spot to see the Spirit in all the team's matches at home by becoming 2025 Season Ticket Members here.

The Latest | May 20, 2025

KANSAS CITY (May 20, 2025) — Kansas City Current forward Michelle Cooper along with midfielders Claire Hutton and Lo'eau LaBonta have been called up by the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) for a training camp and a pair of friendlies against China PR and Jamaica during the upcoming FIFA international window. U.S. Soccer announced its 24-player roster on Tuesday as it begins preparation for Concacaf World Cup qualifying in Fall 2026.

After featuring in the USWNT Futures Camp earlier this year, Cooper and Hutton both got their first senior national team call-up in February for the 2025 SheBelieves Cup presented by Visa. This is the first time in her career LaBonta has been called up by the USWNT.

The Stars and Stripes will play China PR on Saturday, May 31, at Allianz Field in Saint Paul, Minn., with kickoff at 4:30 p.m. CT on TBS, Max and Universo. The USWNT returns to action on Tuesday, June 3, to face Jamaica in St. Louis, Mo., at Energizer Park at 7 p.m. CT on TNT, Max and Universo. Both matches will also broadcast in Spanish on Peacock.

Cooper made her USWNT debut during the SheBelieves Cup, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2-0 victory over Colombia on Feb. 20. In the team's next match against Australia, she scored her first international goal in the 68th minute which stood as the game-winner in a 2-1 win. Cooper also had a decorated youth national team career, highlighted by winning the Golden Boot and Golden Ball at the 2022 Concacaf U-20 Championship as well as captaining her team at the 2022 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

Like Cooper, Hutton's first USWNT appearance was in the 2025 SheBelieves Cup when she started against Australia and logged 70 minutes. She joined the starting lineup again – and played every minute – in an April friendly against Brazil. Hutton's international debut was with the U-17 U.S. Youth National Team at the 2022 Concacaf Championship where she scored six goals. She was also tabbed captain of the U-19 squad at the 2023 PanAm Games and played at the 2024 FIFA U-20 World Cup, earning bronze in both events.

Receiving her first USWNT nod is LaBonta, the Kansas City Current captain who has played every minute of the 2025 National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) season thus far and has recorded three goals and an assist. LaBonta, who joined the professional ranks in 2015, solidified herself among the league's all-time greats from the penalty spot on April 19 when she moved up to No. 3 in NWSL history for most regular season penalties scored with 12. She has played in 166 regular season matches as one of 41 players in league history to reach the 150-marker. Additionally, LaBonta has 10 NWSL Best XI honors – tied for third all-time – and has earned the recognition in back-to-back months this year.

The Kansas City Current are back on the road to take on Chicago Stars FC on Saturday, May 24, at SeatGeek Stadium in Bridgeview, Ill. Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. CT. The match will be broadcast on ION with JP Dellacamera and Jill Loyden on the call as well as on World Feed with Matt Pedersen and McCall Zerboni calling the match. The action will also simulcast locally on KMCI, 38 the Spot and Jillian Carroll Letrinko and Dave Borchardt will have the action on 90.9 The Bridge. Fans can also tune in to hear the match in English, Spanish or Portuguese on the KC Current App.

“Everyone always earns their call-ups but there are some much-deserved call-ups in this camp for players who have shown consistency in league play,” said Hayes. “We have two different types of opponents ahead of us, so we'll have to be creative in breaking down those teams in different ways. Now that everyone has settled into a rhythm with their clubs, or is coming right off their European seasons, our players are at a good level. As has been one of our focuses this year, this camp and the following camp are going to be two amazing opportunities to develop squad depth.”

The roster features seven different players from the USWNT roster that faced Brazil in two matches in early April, headlined by the return of defender Naomi Girma, who has not featured for the USA in 2025 due to injuries but is back to fitness after helping Chelsea FC win the Women's Super League title and FA Cup in England.

Forward Lynn Biyendolo brings her 78 caps and 22 goals back to the roster after missing the April games. Nineteen-year-old Portland Thorns FC midfielder Olivia Moultrie, who has not played for the USA since last October against Iceland, also makes a return. She also played for the USA in early March of 2024 at the Concacaf W Gold Cup, a tournament in which she scored her first two WNT goals.

In addition, Hayes continues to give chances to uncapped players, awarding first-ever senior WNT call-ups to Orlando Pride defender Kerry Abello and Kansas City Current veteran midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta. Abello is a natural left-footer who started 25 games in 2024 and was a key player on the Pride's 2024 NWSL title team. If LaBonta, 32, the Current captain and midfield anchor, plays in St. Paul or St. Louis, she will become the oldest player to debut for the USWNT program in its 40-year history. The third uncapped player on the roster is Seattle Reign goalkeeper Claudia Dickey.

Abello and LaBonta, who has three goals this season for the first place Current, are the 22nd and 23rd first-time call-ups under Hayes. Four additional players earned first-time call-ups under former interim head coach Twila Kilgore after Hayes was hired in November of 2023.

Four of the seven forwards on the roster are 22 years old or younger, and two – Ally Sentnor and Michelle Cooper – scored their first USWNT goals during the SheBelieves Cup earlier this year. Sentnor, the 2024 U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year, scored twice in that tournament – against Colombia and Japan – and Cooper tallied against Australia on a goal set up by Sentnor. Alyssa Thompson has four goals and two assists so far for Angel City while her younger sister Gisele, whose previous call-ups have been at outside back, will get a run as a winger during this camp. Racing Louisville forward Emma Sears also has four goals this season.

The roster includes 17 players from the NWSL and seven who are currently playing their professional club soccer in Europe: two in France, four in England and one, Lily Yohannes, in the Netherlands. The Kansas City Current has three players on the roster while the Utah Royals, Seattle Reign FC, Angel City FC, Portland Thorns FC and the Orlando Pride all have two. Chelsea FC also has two.

Naomi Girma was called up to the women's national soccer team Tuesday for the first time this year, joining 23 others for friendlies with China and Jamaica.

Girma, who was named to FIFA's global Best XI last year, has been sidelined with calf injuries but recently returned to fitness, going 90 minutes in two of Chelsea's last three games in the Women's Super League. Her last appearance for the U.S. came in the gold medal final of the Paris Olympics in August.

Sisters Alyssa and Gisele Thompson, who started their second senior national team match together last month, were also called up but this time with Gisele, a defender, making the roster as a winger. Alyssa has four goals and two assists this season for Angel City, for whom her sister also plays.

Marco Reus scores in the 87th minute as the Galaxy rally to a 2-2 draw with LAFC that ends their five-match losing streak but keeps them winless on the season.

“Everyone always earns their call-ups but there are some much-deserved call-ups in this camp for players who have shown consistency in league play,” USWNT coach Emma Hayes said in a statement. “We have two different types of opponents ahead of us so we'll have to be creative in breaking down those teams in different ways.”

In addition to Girma, seven other players from the Olympic championship team were called up. But Hayes also summoned three uncapped players in Orlando Pride defender Kerry Abello, Kansas City Current midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta and Seattle Reign goalkeeper Claudia Dickey. Canyon Country teenager Olivia Moultrie, who hasn't played for the U.S. since Hayes took over last May, is also on the roster.

“This camp and the following camp are going to be two amazing opportunities to develop squad depth,” Hayes said.

Still missing from the team are forwards Sophia Wilson (née Smith), Trinity Rodman and Mallory Swanson. Smith and Swanson are on maternity leave while Rodman is injured. The trio combined for 10 of the 12 U.S. goals in last summer's Olympics.

The U.S. will play China at Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minn., on May 31 and Jamaica on June 3 at Energizer Park in St. Louis. Here's the roster:

Goalkeepers: Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United).

Defenders: Kerry Abello (Orlando Pride), Crystal Dunn (Paris Saint-Germain), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC), Naomi Girma (Chelsea FC), Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC).

Midfielders: Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current), Lo'eau LaBonta (Kansas City Current), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC), Lily Yohannes (Ajax).

Forwards: Lynn Biyendolo (Seattle Reign FC), Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current), Catarina Macario (Chelsea FC), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville), Ally Sentnor (Utah Royals), Alyssa Thompson (Angel City FC), Gisele Thompson (Angel City FC).

ORLANDO, Fla. (May 20, 2025) — Orlando Pride (5-3-1, 16 points) defender Kerry Abello has earned her first call up to the senior U.S. Women's National Team, it was announced today. Abello will represent the USWNT in the 24-player training camp as they get set to play against China PR on Saturday, May 31, and against Jamaica on Tuesday, June 3.

Since joining the Pride in 2022, Abello has been a staple in the Pride's starting lineup, having most recently become the first player in Pride history to appear in 50 consecutive matches. In 2025, Abello has played in every match so far this year and has played the second most minutes (773) and completes the third most passes on the squad (420).

Last year, the natural left-footer started 25 of a possible 26 games in 2024 and was a key player in helping the Pride secure the double by winning the NWSL Shield and NWSL Championship. Abello was the only Pride field player to play in every match of the 2024 regular season and playoffs and finished the regular season with one goal and two assists.

The 25-year-old has extensive experience with the USA's Youth National Teams. She earned her first call-up at the U-14 level in 2013 and also earned call-ups to the Under-15s (2014), Under-17s (2015), Under-18s (in 2016 and 2017) and Under-19s (in 2017). She also attended a U.S. U-23 WNT camp during her rookie season in 2022, facing India and Sweden. She scored in the 3-0 win over Sweden. Abello has 10 combined U.S. Youth National Team caps, one for the U-17s, four for the U-18s, three for the U-19s and two for the U-23s.","{'href': 'https://www.orlandocitysc.com', 'title': 'Orlando City'}","soccer"

Trinity Rodman and Rose Lavelle continue to be absent from the roster due to injury, while Mal Swanson and Sophia Wilson are both on leave due to pregnancy.

Naomi Girma returns to the USWNT after being out due to injury. She joins Chelsea teammate Catarina Macario on the roster. Lynn Biyendolo also returns to the roster after missing the April matches.

“Everyone always earns their call-ups but there are some much-deserved call-ups in this camp for players who have shown consistency in league play,” USWNT head coach Emma Hayes said in a statement. “We have two different types of opponents ahead of us, so we'll have to be creative in breaking down those teams in different ways.

Herc Gomez discusses the USMNT's striker options ahead of the upcoming Concacaf Gold Cup (1:33)

When it comes to the U.S. men's national team, manager Mauricio Pochettino isn't exactly working with a blank canvas. The core of the team that reached the knockout stages of the 2022 World Cup remains in place.

But with the 2026 World Cup, which is being co-hosted by Canada, Mexico and the U.S., little more than a year away, the Argentine can be forgiven for feeling an urge to erase some parts of the picture while filling in a few additions of his own. That's what last March's woeful showing at the Concacaf Nations League, in which the U.S. fell to Panama in the semifinals and Canada in the third-place game, can do to the thought process of a manager. With that display fresh in mind, there might be a growing sense of urgency to look at other options.

Now, Pochettino did engage in a degree of experimentation during the CNL. Real Salt Lake midfielder Diego Luna emerged as a player on the rise, a wild card who can give the U.S. manager more options in attack. Ditto for Charlotte FC forward Patrick Agyemang, with the Vancouver Whitecaps' Brian White also getting some looks.

Circumstances, even beyond results, might open the door a bit wider for some additional new blood.

The Concacaf Gold Cup starts next month, and the likes of Timothy Weah and Weston McKennie won't be available due to Juventus' Club World Cup commitments. The same could be true for Giovanni Reyna if he hasn't yet extracted himself from his Borussia Dortmund purgatory. There are also a pair of friendlies in early June against Turkey and Switzerland to allow Pochettino the chance to bring in some new players.

With that in mind, here are a few potential candidates who have yet to get a look under Pochettino, but have made their case for a call-up and made U.S. Soccer's 60-man preliminary roster.

Aaronson has filled a variety of roles in Utrecht's midfield this season, sometimes more withdrawn, and at times more advanced, but usually tilted to the left side of midfield. Regardless, Aaronson's eight goals and four assists this season have not only helped Utrecht secure a fourth-place finish (good enough to make the qualifying rounds for the UEFA Europa League) but he was recently nominated for the Johan Cruyff Young Talent of the Year award as the Dutch league's top young player. He'll head back to Frankfurt next season with a better shot of remaining with the first team.

As for the USMNT, Aaronson's versatility should stand him in good stead with Pochettino, and McKennie's presumed absence could create an opening for some playing time. Like everyone on this list, he has made the 60-man provisional roster for the Gold Cup.

Blackmon is something of a late bloomer. He's a product of the U.S. college system, having played at the University of the Pacific, and started his professional career as a right back with LAFC. He was called up to the USMNT for a January camp in 2021, but an injury prevented him from getting on the field.

Blackmon gradually made his way as a center back with Vancouver and has enjoyed a stellar start to the season, playing a massive role in the Caps' Concacaf Champions Cup triumph over Inter Miami CF. Blackmon's passing out of the back has been a particular strength, ranking in the 99th percentile in MLS among defenders in terms of progressive passes completed, according to ESPN Research.

Blackmon's rise could come at the perfect time as well in terms of the USMNT, as the center-back play for the U.S. at the CNL was inconsistent. But the USMNT isn't the only team that is taking notice of Blackmon's performances this season. Sources told ESPN that Canada has been inquiring about Blackmon possibly playing for the CanMNT.

In 2021, Berhalter seemed on his way out of MLS after an indifferent season with Austin FC, but a move to Vancouver gave him new life. And no player has benefited more from Concacaf Champions Cup performances than Berhalter, whose two goals and two assists in the semifinal round against Miami were instrumental in dispatching the Herons. The competition has also served to illustrate Berhalter's box-to-box running and uncanny ability to arrive into the box at the right time to finish off attacking moves.

Like Aaronson, Berhalter faces a crowded midfield for spots, especially with the likes of Johnny Cardoso returning after missing out on the CNL. But the Vancouver midfielder's ability on set pieces -- long a sore spot for the U.S. -- should also stand him in good stead.

In the Sullivan household, Cavan has received most of the attention of late, given his scheduled move to Manchester City. But older brother Quinn has quietly put together an impressive first three months of the season in Philadelphia. He has assisted on seven goals, tied for second in MLS, and delivered 30 key passes, the eighth-highest total in the league. All of this has helped lead the Union into second place in the Eastern Conference.

Sullivan's usual spot on the left wing is typically occupied by one Christian Pulisic, but there's nothing wrong with having increasing depth, especially given Sullivan's ability off the dribble, as well as his creativity. He has shown an ability to pop up in other areas of the field as well.

The only question now: Will Pochettino give him a chance?

Outwardly, there was some upheaval attached to Wiley's season. He was initially loaned to Ligue 1 side Strasbourg but a pair of injuries (knee tendinitis and a separated shoulder) limited him to only six league appearances and the loan was cut short. Wiley fared much better during a subsequent loan to Watford in the English Championship, so much so that there is talk he'll return to the Hornets on another temporary deal next season.

As for the U.S., the absence of both Antonee Robinson and Sergiño Dest during the CNL showed there still isn't much depth at the fullback positions. This is especially true in terms of players with ability to get forward, a strength of Wiley's. At present, there is an opportunity there for him to make his mark.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Pellegrino Matarazzo exclusive: USMNT talks, Hoffenheim time and more in trailblazing career","https://www.givemesport.com/pellegrino-matarazzo-exclusive-usmnt-hoffenheim-bundesliga-american-coach/","Tue, 20 May 2025 13:49:00 GMT","

Pellegrino Matarazzo sits, relaxed and comfortable. An easy smile he flashes often punctures his calm, solution-oriented answers in our 45-minute chat.

Matarazzo jokes that part of his brain comes from his math background (he graduated from Columbia University with a degree in applied mathematics). It's one of many facets that makes the 47-year-old New Jersey native who he is.

Another way to see Matarazzo is as the trailblazing American men's soccer coach that he is. 

He left the states after college to play professionally in Europe, settled in Germany and never left. Matarazzo got his first big break as manager of Stuttgart, who he led to the Bundesliga. He took over at Hoffenheim during the 2022-23 season, saved the club from relegation then qualified for the Europa League in his first (and only) full season at the club.

His reputation has grown to the point that Matarazzo interviewed with the U.S. national team for the vacant men's head coach job last summer.

“I'm not going to deny it: There were good talks (with U.S. Soccer) that took place,” Matarazzo told GIVEMESPORT. “At that time (last summer), it was not meant to be.”

A few months later, in February, Matarazzo was let go by Hoffenheim amid a period of chaos and internal strife at the club. 

“Many times, extraordinary circumstances are the chance for a tremendous learning experience,” Matarazzo said.

He has spent the last seven months enjoying his time. Taking a bit of a reset from the daily grind of soccer, and traveling, but Matarazzo is ready to get back in the game.

The successful coach opened up about his experience of breaking barriers as an American manager in Europe, his time and dismissal at Hoffenheim, talks with the USMNT and much more in a wide-ranging conversation with GIVEMESPORT. His answers have been lightly edited for brevity.

GMS: People in football – coaches in particular – have the competitive nature, wanting to control everything, locked into the daily grind. So, what has the last 6-7 months of your life been like? How do you spend your time, how do you feel?

Pellegrino Matarazzo: Well, I'm very conscious of time.

Enjoying every moment, it's really a great opportunity to pause and reflect on things. Spend time with family and friends and grow personally. I've been travelling quite a bit, to the United States and Italy to visit family, but also places that interest me. My latest trip was to Japan for two weeks with my wife and my son. A fascinating country. On one side you have spiritually and tradition, then you have the modern spirit. The contrast is truly impressive. When you travel, when you're open to expanding your horizons, it'll happen.

Of course I've been using my time on a professional level. Watching football always interests me, even though the first two months I had my TV off to create distance.

I like watching selected games. Teams, coaches, matchups that I value tactically. 

Also I use the time to follow up on certain leagues where maybe there's the possibility of future employment. I think that's normal. It's important to understand the subtle differences from the Bundeslliga, to say, Serie A or the Premier League. Different cultures, training methods, style of play.

You say your TV was off for two months. Was that deliberate, in that “I know this is good for me to step back”, or was that like “I just need the time to get away?”

PM: Both. 

It was deliberate where I had to catch myself to not turn on games when I wanted to. Sometimes when you put distance, you rest a bit then your soccer gene kicks in. That's why I said “selected”. I really started with selected games of coaches that interested me. From zero soccer, to selected matches to possible future employment. 

You left Hoffenheim in November. With some space now to decompress, how would you sum up your time at the club?

PM: To be honest, I look at the positive side. I'll always be grateful for my experience in Hoffenheim, I was able to work with some great people. Despite a very turbulent environment at the club, we were relatively successful. 

Many times, extraordinary circumstances are the chance for a tremendous learning experience. I know I grew as a coach and a leader. When I joined the club in February 2023, there was this ongoing internal power struggle happening and they were in a 9-match winless run. 

We managed to build a focused, strong, cohesive unit and save the team from relegation. The following season, we qualified for European competition.

One game that sums up my time there was our 4-2 win against Bayern Munich in the final game of the season last year, securing a spot in the Europa League. It was a special moment that showed our true character. We went down 2-0 in the first six minutes. We remained composed, showed resilience, determination and belief and ended up scoring four goals to win against Bayern Munich. 

That showed who we were and football doesn't get much better than that. What happened in the summer— well, I guess we can get into that if you have questions.

Please, go on.

PM: Hoffenheim is a club that stands for developing talent and playing attacking football. We scored 66 goals in 2023/24. Maxi Beier, Tom Bischof are just two obvious examples of developed talent. We integrated several other players from the youth academy to the first team. In these areas we were doing very good work.

What happens? (Director of football) Alex Rosen is dismissed in the middle of preseason. The middle of training camp. In the middle of training! With no prior notice! 

Alex was vital to our success, it was a joy working with him. We had a routine every morning where we'd drink matcha tea and discuss the day, allowing us to align with our thoughts.

His dismissal threw the entire club to a very unusual state. What many people don't realize, other senior leaders left the club as well and the result was a big vacuum in club leadership. It was an extraordinary circumstance. My main objective was to keep the players and staff calm, focused on football. It was intense. 

There were a lot of late transfers being made. There's always an advantage when a squad is assembled early, especially when you're in European competition, otherwise you don't have preparation time to integrate game philosophy or establish leadership in the squad. 

Not only did Hoffenheim make many late transfers, they were often positions and profiles where the coaching staff were looking for something else. 

It was a challenging time. It required a lot of mental flexibility on my part. Knowing when to fight hard, but knowing when to let things go. I learned a lot in this phase.

Do you feel betrayed in any way in being let go by Hoffenheim after all you did to save from relegation and then qualify for Europe? 

PM: I mean, who betrayed me? Who was the club? There was a change in leadership. I don't know who I should feel betrayed by, Alex Rosen signed me, he was no longer there. 

I don't feel betrayal, I feel the feeling of unfinished work. There was a lot more to be achieved at the club. I know we were on the right path.

Changing gears— You are among the trailblazers for American coaches in top European soccer. Is that an active thought that ever dawned on you or is it just, like, “I'm doing my thing”?

PM: I'm just doing my thing. I'm just in my tunnel, doing the best I can and getting as far as I can go.

What were the difficulties – if any – you experienced as an American manager breaking through in Germany? Or because you played there and had been there for so long, were you viewed as an honorary German?

PM: I have been here for 25 years and I've broken many barriers along the way. In the beginning, people knew I was Italian-American, they had doubts.

It was a motivation for me to be better. To be better in every way possible I could be. I remember applying for my pro coaching license, the extra difficulties for me to get in. Maybe that's what helped me get to where I am now, the need for excellence. I was fluent in German relatively early. That was an advantage in the German football culture, you need to be able to speak the language.

I definitely had my obstacles to overcome and I think I did an alright job.

I think so too, so much so that you were connected with the U.S. men's national team job. Was that real, did you interview for that? And is that something that would interest you in your career?

PM: I'm not going to deny it: There were good talks (with U.S. Soccer) that took place. At that time (last summer), it was not meant to be.

As a coach, the chance to lead a national team – especially your own – is something special. It was an honor to be associated with a role like that. Of course I would be open to it in the future if the project fits and the timing is right.

You mentioned earlier that you were watching specific leagues that could be where your next job is. Is there anything you're able to say on which leagues those are?

PM: I definitely have a clear vision and ambitious goals for what my career should look like as a head coach, but I also understand the path is not always linear. 

Every coach has the ambition to lead a top team in a top league in Europe, to compete in Champions League. I'm certainly now exception, especially since I've gained experience in the Bundesliga and Europa League. Of course I can imagine continuing in the Bundesliga, I love the football culture here. Working in the Premier League is a goal for a lot of coaches who want to work at the highest level. That's a dream.

Serie A is also appealing to me because of a very emotional component to it, with my family roots coming from Italy. I used to watch the Serie A on a very small TV in my father's room growing up.

To be honest, I'm open to many things. I don't rule out anything. In general, it's about taking the next step to help me grow. 

Lastly, to anyone reading, I want to let you give this in your own words– How do you see the game? What is your preferred style?

PM: When I watch games, I see spaces, I see numbers, I see rhythms. 

I consider myself very adaptable to the existing conditions of a club and I form my squads around their strengths in order to win, to create identity. I consider myself a flexible coach, and with my math background, very solution-oriented. It's important in modern football to be very adaptable. The football I played at Stuttgart was very different than the football I played at Hoffenheim, but we reached our goals at both clubs.

That being said, I have an attacking and forward-driven nature. I want to be in control. I like to dominate the center of the pitch, in and out of possession, and a strong focus on change of pace. I don't just mean moments of transition, that's obvious, but all crucial moments. It's important to protect yourself in moments of vulnerability and it's important to hurt your opponent when they're exposed.

That's a little of what I'm about.

Florian Wirtz is arguably the most sought-after talent in the world right now and Liverpool have taken steps to signing him

The 21-year-old defender would be ‘open and happy' to join Liverpool this summer.

Big praise from the World Cup-winning German. 

Pep Guardiola doesn't believe he should be in the conversation of the greatest manager ever while he's not retired, and offered his trio of GOATs.

Eric Cantona dismissed the idea that Pele is the greatest player in football history - instead offering his own pick for that crown.

The defender was seen watching the away end in full swing and fans have their thoughts on what his feelings were.","{'href': 'https://www.givemesport.com', 'title': 'GiveMeSport'}","soccer"

TOPICS:

The U.S. Men's National Soccer Team released its preliminary 60-man Gold Cup roster this past week which will eventually be chopped down to the final 26-man group by no later than June 4th.  Despite being unable to make the Olympic squad 1 year ago at this time (a squad comprised almost exclusively of players under the age of 23), no one is surprised to see Diego Luna's name included on the list with many believing he has a strong chance of making the final 26-man team as well.

Luna's rapid rise under new USMNT Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino accelerated during the team's January camp when the 21-year-old suffered a broken nose against Costa Rica but refused to leave the game, registering an assist on their opening goal almost immediately after.



“Coach is looking at me like ‘are you ready to come off?'” Luna recounted on the most recent episode of Unfiltered Soccer with Landon Donovan and Tim Howard.  “And I'm like, ‘no, there's no way, there's no way.  There's no way I'm coming off in the fifteenth minute, because of this thing, you know? I can still run, I can still see, you know, you're not stopping me right now.'”

Luna's skill has always been apparent but that determination is what has begun to take him to the next level and never was this more on display than that January night in Orlando.

“In those moments, you think in your head, this is an opportunity where you can take the easy way and, you know, hop off and, you broke your nose, what a story, blah, blah, blah. Or, you're gonna grab your chance and go for it.  So, I think for me it was just saying there's no way I'm coming out of this game.”

After not being named to the 2024 Paris Olympic squad, Luna is more aware than most of just how precious these opportunities are.  And now, he has a coach on the national team level that is not only providing him with the opportunity to prove himself but one that he has been able to connect with as well.

“The biggest thing about [Pochettino] is that he made me feel comfortable off the field as a human, which allowed us to be able to feel free and no pressure when you're on the field. And I think that was the biggest thing for me. He knows how to connect with the players one-on-one.”

While Pochettino may have been the one to present Luna with his chance, you can't say the Real Salt Lake midfielder hasn't forced the issue with his play on the field.  After scoring 13 goals in his first 67 appearances with RSL, Luna has already scored 7 times in 13 starts this season.  And while he remains steadfast on the task at hand in MLS, it is also not lost on him of what's looming in the summer of 2026.

“That's the big goal, right?” Said Luna.  “Every game with RSL, every opportunity I get with the national team, it's grind time. You got one big goal in a year and every little thing you do is now setting you up to either make [the World Cup team] or to not.”

Co-owner Todd Boehly has confirmed Andrey Santos' future after outlining Chelsea's summer transfer plans ahead of the Club World Cup.

The American billionaire was speaking at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday and Chelsea, as expected, was a hot topic of conversation, particularly with the club's Champions League fate being decided this week.

Chelsea have qualification in their hands and will head to Nottingham Forest this Sunday in their final match of the 2024-25 Premier League season. It is the first of two huge games as Enzo Maresca's side also travel to Wroclaw, Poland next week for the Conference League final.

It's been a strong end to the season for Chelsea after a dip mid-season and should they come out unscathed, it will mark a 'very good' first season for Maresca.

""I think we had a good season that can become very good,"" said Maresca in his pre-Conference League press conference.

Boehly and Clearlake Capital, another one of the Chelsea co-owners, have given the backing of Maresca and will be hoping the 45-year-old can get the Blues over the line, which will give them a significant boost this summer - both in terms of their financial position and ability to convince their top transfer targets to join the club.

During his conference on Tuesday, Boehly was quizzed on a range of topics, including the Club World Cup and the return of Andrey Santos, to the club's stadium plans and transfer expectations this summer.

Here's what the Chelsea co-owner said on Tuesday at the Qatar Economic Forum with Bloomberg.

""A combination of both. It's like in anything I own. The good news is the bad news. If people didn't care then it would stink. It's a testament to how much the sport matters.""

""If you look at the Premier League right now, there is so much excitement in it, especially with what's going on at the last weekend. There's seven teams that could be making Champions League. The winner of Tottenham and Man United will go to the Champions League. We'll have nine teams in European competition out of the Premier League alone, which to me is a testament to the quality of the product. To be part of that is a privilege.""

""I think the level of competition is ferocious. The margins of error are so small. I don't think I fully appreciated that the margin of error is so small. I think the sport's gotten more and more competitive in the Premier League and that makes winning all that much sweeter. I really didn't know how much I'd love a goal, a goal feels so good. Giving up a goal is the worst. There's nothing like a goal.""

""I think Chairman is a pretty good one! I can't play! Maybe I'll go as striker, see how the fans think about that!""

""We have a good partnership. Like every partnership, you have times that you have to work through and times that are better. We hit the ground running in such an intense timeline that it was a complex moment. We're through it and we're excited about what the future holds.

""We think we have one of the best young teams. We were early on doing seven, eight, nine year contracts because we really wanted to make sure that we could keep the team together for a long time. In order to have a really good team you need stability within the team, environment. The only way that comes is through time. We set it up to be able to benefit from that.""

""We don't have any clauses like that in any of our contracts.""

""We're going to the Club World Cup, so we are laser focused on the Club World Cup. We have some players that are joining us that weren't on the team - Andrey Santos, we're really excited about him and what he can add to the squad.""

""We've done most of our investing. We're not looking at it as a spend, we look at it as an investment. We're trying to build the best portfolio of players that can perform at the highest level for the longest periods of time.

""We know what we need to do. We know the places that we need to invest. That's going to be our focus.""

""Long term we just have to figure it out. We recognise a club like Chelsea needs a 65,000 person stadium. We also recognise that that's going to be important to be able to compete long term. We'll figure that out.""

...

Kevin De Bruyne has issued the first real indication as to whether he will be a part of the Manchester City squad competing at this summer's FIFA Club World Cup.

The Belgium international is due to leave the club on a free transfer in the coming weeks after a decision was made internally not to renew the player's contract beyond its current expiry date at the end of June.

Since making the announcement of his pending exit from Manchester City, De Bruyne has been placed at the centre of widespread transfer speculation with supposed interest from clubs in Italy, the United States, Saudi Arabia, and even in England.

     

While Kevin De Bruyne weighs up his options alongside input from those close to him, with a decision expected to significantly take into account personal life and its suitability to a young family, there remains further question marks surrounding his exit.

The 33-year-old's Manchester City contract is due to expire midway through the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup tournament in the United States, and many have wondered whether the midfielder would withdraw himself from availability to take care of his future prospects.

Speaking to reporters from Wembley Stadium after Manchester City's recent FA Cup Final defeat to Crystal Palace, De Bruyne was quizzed on what the immediate future holds for him in terms of his availability for Pep Guardiola's side this summer.

“It doesn't make any sense [for free agents], but I think that happens when you push in new tournaments in the middle of this contract situation,” De Bruyne said of the newly-expanded and revamped tournament.

He added, “I have to take care of myself because if I get injured in the Club World Cup, what am I going to do? Nobody's going to take care of me at that point. So there's a big chance probably I won't play it.”

On the subject of a decision over his next club, the 33-year-old said, “I want to finish these two games and then obviously, ultimately, afterwards make a decision, but it's not that easy. I have to take care of my family. I've got three kids, my wife, it's not an easy process at this time.”

Manchester City are lined-up to take on three fixtures at the revamped and expanded tournament so far, with a group stage schedule featuring clashes with Italy's Juventus, Morocco's Wydad AC, and the United Arab Emirates' Al Ain.

Pep Guardiola would ideally like to see the club bring in some new names in time for the tournament to begin, using the initial three fixtures as a bedding in process for fresh faces acclimatising to life with their new club.

One move that appears to be progressing more than any other at present is that of Tijjani Reijnders, with dialogue already established with both the player and AC Milan, and the Dutchman himself believed to be interested in the idea of an Etihad Stadium switch.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

ByTom Sanderson,

 Senior Contributor. 

Real Madrid has agreed to make its second pre-Club World Cup signing according to Spanish radio station COPE, which cited anonymous sources.

Los Blancos have already reacted to a trophyless season, in terms of primary domestic and European silverware, plus newfound dominance from bitter rival FC Barcelona, by agreeing for head coach Carlo Ancelotti to leave at the end of the season.

He is likely to be replaced by club legend Xabi Alonso, and though there has been no official announcement from Madrid on the matter yet, the former midfielder has already revealed he will step down from his head coach role at Bayer Leverkusen, who he helped clinched its first Bundesliga title in 2023/2024.

As we often see when things don't go right for the Bernabeu giants, President Florentino Perez has been getting his cheque book out to try and level up with Barca next term.

Before what is expected to be a busy summer in the transfer market, Madrid has already completed the signing of Bournemouth and Spain central defender Dean Huijsen, who was released from his Premier League contract after the payment of a $67 million (£50 million) release clause at the weekend.

According to COPE, Madrid has reached another agreement with a young star because it will re-sign Nico Paz from Como prior to June 30.

If the deal is completed before said date, Madrid can recapture its ex-Argentina international for just $6.7 million (€6 million) after selling him last summer. But if it waits until July 1 onwards, that amount will then rise to $10.1 million (€9 million).

The plan is to have Paz successfully complete the ‘Carvajal Route' - which entails leaving Madrid and then returning to form part of the first team as the right back of the same name did from Leverkusen more than a decade ago - prior to the lucrative Club World Cup.

It now remains to be seen if the deal gets over the line, but it shouldn't be too complicated to complete with the tournament kicking off in over three weeks' time.

Earlier this season, Ancelotti revealed that Madrid had been keeping tabs on Paz in Italy.

“He's one of us, we're following him, he's doing very well, I have no doubts. At the end of the season we'll decide what to do. If I have to give advice to a youngster... I think patience is a great quality,” said the Italian.

At Real Madrid, the 20-year-old is expected to battle for minutes with the likes of Fede Valverde, Jude Bellingham, Brahim Diaz, and Arda Guler.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","soccer"

Real Madrid are intent on sealing a deal for Benfica's Alvaro Carreras before the Club World Cup to add to their new-look defence, which will already include Dean Huijsen and Trent Alexander-Arnold. That will cross off three of their priorities, and likely be the only further business before the Club World Cup, with the possible exception of Nico Paz. However the next priority will be a midfielder that can set the tone for Los Blancos.

It appears Arsenal are set to win the race for Real Sociedad's Martin Zubimendi, who had been the midfielder that was most heavily linked with Los Blancos – especially with the arrival of Xabi Alonso. Other alternatives are beginning to emerge though, with the likes of Angelo Stiller and Tijjani Reijnders also in their thinking.

Before Zubimendi, Stiller or Reijnders, the man that Real Madrid had earmarked as their big-name signing in midfield was Manchester City‘s Rodri Hernandez, before he tore his cruciate ligament earlier this season. The Ballon d'Or winner is back in the City squad as they face Bournemouth on Tuesday night for the first time in eight months.

Cadena SER say that those in the offices at Real Madrid will be paying very close attention to how he recovers from his injury. Rodri is well-liked by Real Madrid, and is a native to the Spanish capital. If he does look like his old self, he will also be considered for a move this summer.

The 28-year-old would be a rare exception to Los Blancos' usual transfer policy, a sign of both the scarcity in the market of midfielders of his level, and his own quality. Generally Real Madrid only spend big on players in their early twenties or teenage years as long-term investments, and they will no doubt want to see clear evidence that Rodri is not suffering the impact of the injury.

Twaddle. Nor would Rodri go to a club that behaved so gracefully when he rightly won the Ballon d'Or. Horrible football club, horrible players

The 33-year-old will leave City after a decade at the club having lifted six Premier League titles, as well as winning the Champions League and Club World Cup in 2023.

The Belgian is under contract until June 30, which covers three Club World Cup matches in the United States, but De Bruyne said he would have to look out for his own interests.

""I think in a way I have to take care of myself because if I get injured in the Club World Cup, what am I going to do? Nobody's going to take care of me at that point,"" he said after the FA Cup final in quotes carried by The Athletic.

""So there's a big chance probably that I won't play it, but I don't know. I'm just a player. I don't make the rules, I can't do anything about it.

Embodying triumph and ambition, adidas unveil a special edition boot collection set to be worn on one of football's biggest stages during the FIFA Club World Cup. Unified by golden hues and purple accents, each silo is crafted for champions and designed for glory – ready for a summer of football. 

Celebrating the pursuit of greatness, adidas drop the ‘Road To Glory' pack – the latest special edition boot collection by the Three Stripes. With the FIFA Club World Cup set to begin in less than a month, players are setting their sights on more silverware and a chance to write their name in history. It's only right that they do it in style. Here is where adidas enter the chat.

The new Road to Glory pack has been crafted for the best, designed to lead the adi athletes to ‘glory'. The striking colourway has been chosen to symbolize ambition and success, blending sleek aesthetics with performance innovation.

Each silo features a crisp white base, contrasted by black Three Stripes cascading down the sides – timeless. Luxurious gold detailing adds a premium look to each boot, featuring across finer detailing as well as a golden metallic soleplate. At a closer look, subtle purple tones add depth to the designs, particularly across the F50 silo where a gradient style pattern engulfs the toe of the boot. The Copa silo features repeated 'Copa' branding across the upper – a new feature for this boot which we have not seen adidas experiment with before. All three silo's drop in laced and laceless versions, whilst the Pred also arrives with the popular Full Tongue.

Adidas have kitted out each silo with top-of-the-range technology. The Predator 25 features the established StrikeSkin rubber fins, designed to increase touch and control, paired with a soft Hybridtouch upper. The F50, whilst built for speed and acceleration, does not forget about grip, with a Sprintweb 3D tech which adds an extra textured surface to the upper. The classic Copa stays timeless in aesthetic whilst up-to-date in performance, with a Fusionskin leather upper and Comfortframe outsole. 

Lock in for a summer of football at the FIFA Club World Cup to watch these stunning boots take the pitch.

The Road To Glory pack is available now at prodirectsport.com/soccer

With the return of the Champions League right around the corner, adidas have taken a dose of inspiration from the design of the competition's new match ball, and spread it across the Predator Mutator and COPA 20+, creating a mini pack known as the ‘Glory Hunter' Pack.

With the preliminary play-off round of the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup set to get underway today, adidas have unveiled the official match ball for the tournament. Known as the ‘Tsubasa', the colourful design takes inspiration from the popular ‘Captain Tsubasa' Japanese Manga anime series.

PUMA make their final moves of 2018 in stunning style as they drop the new ""Glory Pack"" consisting of their two leading on-pitch silos – the ONE 19.1 and Future 2.1 boots.

The Glitch fix remains locked into the adidas 2018 World Cup plans as France defenders Benjamin Mendy and Presnel Kimpembe both trained in more unreleased outer-skins designs this afternoon.

adidas have officially unveiled the match ball for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025, and it's a beauty. With the tournament fast approaching, this release bolsters the excitement for another summer of football. We can't wait. 

The FIFA Club World Cup 2025 is set to revamp the competition into a truly global event that will bring together the best club sides from across the globe. Here we take a closer look at the intricate detail behind the design of the tournament's new trophy.

It's World Cup season. Flags out, shades on, TV-in-the-garden season. With every 2018 World Cup shirt now revealed and rated we've built a 30 piece alternative replica list for this upcoming summer festival of football to get those jersey juices flowing.

The curtain has finally come down on the first-ever winter World Cup, and while it was Lionel Messi who led Argentina to ultimate glory and immortality, as far as the brands go it will be adidas who were left with the biggest grins of all…

Reports in Italy claim that Inter's latest offer of €23m is close to meeting Olympique de Marseille's demands for Luis Henrique, and that the Nerazzurri are confident that he will be part of the squad for the FIFA Club World Cup, which starts in mid-June. 

Inter have been on the tail of the Brazilian winger for several months, and are close to striking a deal with Marseille, who have recently confirmed that the player will be leaving at the end of the 2024-25 season. 

“We aim to sell Luis Henrique before June 30 for financial reasons and out of respect for our ownership. The Club World Cup radically changed contracts,” Marseille President recently disclosed. 

He also added that: “Discussions are ongoing with other clubs, not just [Inter].”

According to reports from La Gazzetta dello Sport, Inter are close to sealing an agreement with Marseille after their latest offer of €23m. Marseille have reportedly been pushing for a price tag in the region of €25m. 

The Pink Paper adds that there is now ‘very little left' before a formal agreement is struck between the Nerazzurri and Marseille. 

Reports in April claim that there is already a verbal agreement in place over a five-year contract in San Siro, which will run until the summer of 2030.

Hello! Today we're writing about one of football's richest clubs. Who you've probably never heard of. From a space-age city which hasn't been built.

On the way:

💰 Saudi's $1.5tn NEOM project

🗣️ Delap holds Man Utd talks

🥹 Tearful Martinez moving on?

👀 Salah's collector's item

Searching for The Line on a map of the world is a fool's errand, because the city doesn't exist. It's a concept in the mind of Saudi Arabia's royal family, part of a futuristic project known as NEOM which in theory will hold a population of nine million.

A staggering sum of money, $1.5tn (£1.1tn), has been set aside to turn the vision into a reality. The Saudis envisage The Line — an ambitious, or ostentatious, trail of infrastructure spanning 170km  — being front and centre when the country hosts the FIFA World Cup in 2034. To that end, they want a stadium and a football club to match the largesse.

This is where NEOM SC come in, a shrouded enigma which James Montague has done as well as anybody in unravelling. This determined piece of digging, published in The Athletic and comprising a chapter from a book written by James, epitomises football's transfer of power to new frontiers, and the Middle East most of all.

NEOM are owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the deep-pocketed Saudi entity which runs Newcastle United. Before PIF picked NEOM up, they were known as Al Suqoor, a team with crowds barely worth registering. But Tabuk, the city in northern Saudi where Al Suqoor played, was near the land allocated for The Line — so PIF selected them for a rebrand and a capital injection.

PIF controls the entire NEOM scheme and the extravagance of its intentions can't be overstated. The Line (for which construction has started) is supposed to have no currency or roads. Robots will act as servants and cars will fly. A state-of-the-art stadium is being designed to sit half a kilometre off the ground. It sounds like a Marvel movie.

In the future, PIF sees a day when NEOM SC move to The Line and become one of the world's biggest teams. They could already be classed as the world's richest. But from a standing start, how is such a steep jump in status remotely feasible?

Saudi investment in football invariably brings with it allegations that the Gulf state is engaged in ‘sportswashing': using the game to enhance its global image and divert attention from concerns about issues like its human rights record.

It is, however, very close to FIFA and the governing body's president, Gianni Infantino. Saudi Arabia was nominated to host the 2034 World Cup unopposed, 12 years on from the tournament being held in Qatar. For better or worse, it's at the heart of football's political evolution and its wealth is helping to make its voice heard.

As for NEOM, they were promoted to the Pro League for the first time last month. Attendances are up to 10,000. One strand of PIF's strategy is to ensure they qualify for the 2029 Club World Cup, which tells a story about how FIFA's new hobby horse is attracting the attention it craves.

James was able to get inside NEOM SC and speak to key stakeholders there, an achievement in itself since the NEOM building site is secretive, inaccessible and virtually unphotographed. NEOM's chairman, Meshari al Motairi, had never been interviewed before James pinned him down. He described sport as an “accelerator for many things” — isn't it just? — and was in no doubt that NEOM were headed for the big time.

This will go one of two ways. Either the club rise like a rocket, or they go down as another episode of the Emperor's New Clothes. But however things turn out, NEOM aren't the story here. They're a mere pawn in football's Game of Thrones, where the sands are shifting rapidly.

There's a definite trend of Europe's big clubs getting their ducks in a row on the transfer front early. Real Madrid have done Dean Huijsen. Liverpool should push Jeremie Frimpong over the line shortly. And now, Manchester United are making inroads with Liam Delap and Matheus Cunha.

Cunha to Old Trafford from Wolverhampton Wanderers has been in the offing for a while, helped by a £62.5m ($83.5m) release clause. That deal is advancing. But while Ipswich Town striker Delap has a release clause too (lower, at £30m), he's hugely in demand. Laurie Whitwell's report of face-to-face talks between the 22-year-old and United officials can only be a positive sign for Ruben Amorim.

How much the club's intentions rest on Champions League qualification through the Europa League final remains to be seen but either way, Amorim is crying out for new toys. He's got David Beckham in his corner, telling The Athletic that Amorim is “a very good manager”. Beckham might have bigger things to worry about at Inter Miami but when he speaks, people listen. A little nudge at the hierarchy won't hurt.

🎙️ Our podcast team have been trying to decide: will winning the Europa League final fix United? I'm not convinced it's as simple as that, and neither are they. Listen on Apple and Spotify.

Whether Emiliano Martinez is the world's best goalkeeper is a matter of debate. This season hasn't been his finest. But for two years running, he's been voted as such: the winner of the Yashin Trophy in 2023 and 2024.

On Friday, however, Martinez was in floods of tears after Villa's final home game of 2024-25, the universal sign of a player about to check out. As Jacob Tanswell and Gregg Evans explain, the 32-year-old's situation is up in the air. No decision has been taken on his future and no transfer has been finalised. But it's easy enough to read the room.

Villa have been dealing with intense PSR pressures, and Martinez would command a tidy fee. He's a showman, a World Cup winner, a penalty expert and a wind-up merchant, and he's an easy keeper to love if he happens to be yours. Nothing better demonstrates that than Villa's fans launching a donation page aimed at raising $7m to retain him.

What next for Martinez, then? And how would Villa manage the end of his era, or the gaping hole he leaves behind? Because the Argentine packing up is a potential parting we didn't see coming.



(Selected games, times ET/UK)

Premier League: Crystal Palace vs Wolverhampton Wanderers, 3pm/8pm — Peacock Premium (U.S. only); Manchester City vs Bournemouth, 3pm/8pm — USA Network, Fubo/Sky Sports.

Last night's fixture at the Amex was a formality for Liverpool. As our own Adam Hurrey — aka Football Cliches — would have it, the Premier League champions are spiritually on the beach.

Just as well for Mohamed Salah, who strayed a thousand leagues out of character by sticking a sitter wide, above, with Liverpool 2-1 up against Brighton (they went on to lose 3-2). Yesterday we asked if Le Havre's Abdoulaye Toure was human. It turns out that Salah is. Which is nice to know.

If you need to see the 2026 World Cup in person, stick to Canada and Mexico. The US isn't safe for visitors.

President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with the White House Task Force for the 2026 World Cup on May 6, 2025, in Washington, DC.

There are three messages that the United States is sending to the world in advance of the 2026 World Cup, and you should take two of them seriously. The first comes from President Donald Trump, who said at a recent press conference hyping the 2026 World Cup, “We can't wait to welcome soccer fans from all over the globe.” These are the words of an addled carnival barker, whose ego gets a jolt every time he thinks of doing a Hitler-at-the-1936-Olympics impression at the world's most popular sporting event. This you should not take seriously.

The second message is from that smarmy supplicant JD Vance at that same press conference. The vice president attempted a joke probably workshopped with someone he follows on X who has a YouTube show boosting eugenics. He said, “I know we'll have visitors probably from close to 100 countries. We want them to come. We want them to celebrate. We want them to watch the game. But, when the time is up, they'll have to go home. Otherwise they'll have to talk to [Department of Homeland Security] Secretary [Kristi] Noem.” Nothing like a veiled threat to have people sent to the USA's offshore torture/labor camp in El Salvador to prime the tourist profit pump.

But make no mistake, Vance's message is serious; as serious as the naked ambition that emanates from this barely shaved chipmunk. Expect the preparations for the World Cup to be accompanied by raids of non-white communities, immigrant and otherwise. Given that it is normal to see the state off its leash anyways in host cities before the World Cup, one can only tremble or seethe at the thought of what will take place. Trump will likely exploit the Cup to engineer a crackdown—particularly in Los Angeles, with its high population of undocumented immigrants and its Democratic mayor, Karen Bass—that looks more like the 1978 World Cup held by a torture regime in Argentina than the comparatively placid one in South Africa in 2010 (despite the media hysteria).

This leads us to the last point: Stay the fuck away, world. This is not a safe place for anyone without a passport, and these days even a passport guarantees nothing. US citizens, including Native Americans, are being scooped up by ICE. Navajo Nation president Buu Nygren recently recounted numerous Navajo citizens experiencing “negative and sometimes traumatizing encounters” with ICE.

If the out-of-control crackdown being orchestrated by ICE and the US Customs and Border Patrol is dangerous to this country's First Peoples, then you can bet it is perilous for visitors from around the world. Ask the teenage backpackers from Germany who reported being strip-searched and imprisoned after landing in Hawaii. Ask the Canadian entrepreneur who spent two weeks in the Otay Mesa Detention Center, an experience she described as being “kidnapped, thrown into some sort of sick psychological experiment meant to strip us of every ounce of strength and dignity.” Ask green-card holder and lawful permanent resident Mahmoud Khalil. Ask student visa holder, the now blessedly free Rümeysa Öztürk.

Hosting the 2026 World Cup in the United States is dangerous for teams, their families, and their fans. And the word is out. A new group—Boycott USA 2026—has emerged to demand that “games scheduled in the USA must be moved or boycotted.” The organization is concerned that international visitors may be in danger and that the Trump administration may use the soccer tournament as an alibi for intensifying its deportation machine.

Numerous countries have issued travel warnings against the United States, including Canada, France, Ireland, Germany, Portugal, and Finland. They are among the growing number of people who can see that Vance's joking is serious business.

Vance once claimed that telling jokes with his “guy friends” is “the essence of masculinity.” (There goes Vance lying again—this time about having friends.) More importantly, members of the Trump administration—from Vance to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to Trump himself—have used what they call jokes to make political space for depraved social policy. When critics push back, the standard-issue riposte is to tell those humorless fuddy-duddies not to be so uptight. But Trump and his ilk use crude humor to normalize xenophobia, racism, sexism, and transphobia. And once people are judged as unworthy of basic human dignity—after all they are “poison in the blood”—then come the arrests, camps, the prisons, and the death of due process. It's all one agenda, and everything is in service of that agenda.

Vance got plenty of attention for his “joke” at the task-force presser, but Trump let one fly as well. When the president was asked whether people who have been engaging in “pro-Palestinian protests across the world” should feel safe to travel to the United States to enjoy the World Cup, he responded, “I think people are allowed to protest. You have to do it in a reasonable manner. Not necessarily friendly, but reasonable. Otherwise Pam will come after you, and you're gonna have a big problem.” This is the third message.

“Pam” is US Attorney General Pam Bondi who, in a spate of Trumpian sycophancy, recently yukked it up about sending drug traffickers to a reopened Alcatraz Prison. Bondi also just signed off on Trump receiving a “new Air Force One” plane from Qatar as a gift, a brazen piece of corruption by a regime on a historic grifting spree. For those of us who remember scandals like donors spending the night in the Lincoln bedroom, it's remarkable how any moral standards now appear quaint. All too often mainstream journalists are complicit in laundering this new political reality.

We can't expect FIFA to stand up to Trump. The world's governing body for soccer claims to care about human rights. But of course, sitting elbow-to-elbow with Trump under the press-conference spotlight, FIFA president Gianni Infantino somehow didn't raise any concerns about ICE snapping up undocumented residents and sending them off to the notorious CECOT mega-prison in El Salvador. Instead, Infantino chuckled along when the president interrupted him to insist that the United States be listed first as the host of the event, ahead of Canada and Mexico. Infantino has even moved to Miami—some 70 miles down the road from Mar-a-Lago—where FIFA reportedly foots the $5,000-per-month bill for his daughter to attend private school. He was a special guest at Trump's inauguration earlier this year where he yanked out his phone as the president took the oath of office, presumably so he could post to Instagram, where he regularly vies against heavy competition to be Trump's greatest sycophant.

The 2026 World Cup starts in only 13 months (on June 11, 2026). And yet, according to the US State Department wait times are 18 months for visas from Colombia, 12 months for Nigeria, 11 months for Ecuador, and five months for Algeria (these are for general visas unrelated to the World Cup). Adam Crafton reported in The Athletic that State Department officials are expressing concern that DOGE's reckless dismantling of the federal government may well exacerbate these wait times as well as the acceptance rates for World Cup tourists who need a visa.

People should start pulling their visa applications (even applying now comes with the threat of “enhanced vetting”) and to not come to the United States for the World Cup. You are entering an airspace where, thanks to government cuts, planes can no longer safely take off and land. Once off the plane, you will be entering an airport that could become your prison. Once you make it through, you are a leaving-your-visa-papers-in-your-hotel-room away from a gulag. Please, for yourselves, for your families, stay away from the United States. As for the players, do not bring your families into the United States. Do not endanger the people you love. It may be difficult to imagine a boycott of the US portion of the World Cup. But if you must see the tournament in person, the wonderful World Cup venues in Mexico and Canada provide an alternative for those who don't find concentration camps “funny.”

The new-look FIFA Club World Cup is coming this June and July with every game available to watch live on Foxtel and Kayo Sports.

Thirty-two teams from across six confederations will descend on the United States with the likes of English Premier League heavyweights Manchester City as well as Spanish giants Real Madrid to vie for the title of best club team in the world.

The revamped tournament replicates the format of previous FIFA World Cups with eight groups of four battling it out with the two highest places team in each group advancing to the Round of 16, and it being sudden death through from then on with quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final following suit.

Watch The UEFA Women's Champions League Final LIVE on Kayo Sports | Arsenal vs Barcelona Sunday 25 May 2am AEST | New to Kayo? Get your first month for just $1. Limited time offer.









Unfortunately for Australian football fans, no A-League sides managed to nab one of the Asian Football Confederation places, but Auckland City from New Zealand's national league will represent Oceania.

And best of all, all 63 games will be shown live across Kayo and Foxtel.

Here is our guide to how the FIFA Club World Cup will work.



HOW TO WATCH

From the opening game between Lionel Messi's Inter Miami and Egyptian outfit Al Ahly at Hard Rock Stadium, the home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins, on Sunday June 15 AEST to the final at New York's MetLife Stadium on Monday July 14 AEST, you can catch all the action from the FIFA Club World Cup live on Foxtel and Kayo Sports.

A dedicated 24/7 channel will be available on Kayo Sports along with highlights packages, minis from every match and supplementary programming with all the colour and background stories from the tournament.



WHO ARE THE TEAMS INVOLVED?

Asian Football Confederation - Al Ain (UAE), Al Hilal (Saudi Arabia), Ulsan HD (South Korea), Urawa Red Diamonds (Japan).

Confederation of African Football - Al Ahly (Egypt), Esperance de Tunis (Tunisia), Mamelodi Sundowns (South Africa), Wydad AC (Morocco).

Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football - Inter Miami (United States), Monterrey (Mexico), Pachuca (Mexico), Seattle Sounders (United States), TBD (Winner of LAFC v Club America).

South American Football Confederation - Boca Juniors (Argentina), Botafogo (Brazil), Flamengo (Brazil), Fluminense (Brazil), Palmeiras (Brazil), River Plate (Argentina).

Oceania Football Confederation - Auckland City (New Zealand). 

Union of European Football Associations - Atletico Madrid (Spain), Bayern Munich (Germany), Benfica (Portugal), Borussia Dortmund (Germany), Chelsea (England), Inter Milan (Italy), Juventus (Italy), Manchester City (England), PSG (France), Porto (Portugal), Real Madrid (Spain), Red Bull Salzberg (Austria).

WHY IS THERE NO A-LEAGUE TEAM INVOLVED?

Qualification for the FIFA Club World Cup was dependent on either winning a continental title in one of the four most-recent seasons or by having a high ranking of performance in the top-level continental tournament over the four-year period.

No A-League side has won the Asian Champions League (now called AFC Champions League Elite) since Western Sydney Wanderers in 2014, in fact they are the only Australian team to do so, and no A-League teams have performed consistently strongly in Asia in the last four years either.

Therefore, the four spots went to 2023-24 champions Al Ain, 2022 champions Urawa Red Diamonds, 2021 winners Al-Hilal and 2020 victors Ulsan HD.

WHY ARE LIVERPOOL NOT INVOLVED?

It appears odd that the Premier League champions will not be a part of the FIFA Club World Cup, but like in Asia, England's spots are dependent on Champions League success.

Given Manchester City (2023) and Chelsea (2021) have won the European title in the last four years, the two spot England were awarded were given to them rather than Liverpool.

HOW DID OTHER TEAMS QUALIFY?

Some teams who did not win their respective federation's continental title in the past four years were awarded places for their average performance over the four-year cycle.

There was also a spot reserved for the host country, which was given to David Beckham-owned, Lionel Messi-featuring Major League Soccer side Inter Miami.

by Martina Alcheva May 20, 2025

The future of Portugal's national team is under the spotlight as whispers of a high-profile reunion grow louder. Jose Mourinho, one of soccer's most iconic managers, is once again linked with his homeland — and with a possible reunion with Cristiano Ronaldo ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. While Portuguese officials have remained silent on any imminent changes, Mourinho's recent five-word response to swirling rumors has only added fuel to the fire.

According to multiple reports from Turkish media, the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) is eyeing Jose Mourinho as a potential successor to Roberto Martínez, whose contract runs until July 31, 2026. The move, if completed, would represent Mourinho's first venture into international management.

Per HT Spor journalist Ahmet Selim Kul, Mourinho has already reached a preliminary agreement to take over the national side following the conclusion of the UEFA Nations League finals this June. The 62-year-old tactician is currently under contract with Fenerbahce, but his first season in Turkey has been underwhelming, marked by elimination in both the Europa League and Turkish Cup, and falling short in the Super Lig title race, which was sealed by rivals Galatasaray.

Despite the setbacks, he remains a towering figure in Portuguese soccer, and his appointment would bring him back into contact with Cristiano Ronaldo, whom he famously managed at Real Madrid between 2010 and 2013. Their relationship during that period was complex but fruitful: Ronaldo scored 168 goals in 164 appearances under Mourinho, a staggering record of efficiency and brilliance.

While speculation intensified across Turkish and Portuguese outlets, Mourinho finally addressed the rumors during a post-match press conference following Fenerbahce's 2-1 win over Eyupspor. With all eyes on him, the experienced boss delivered a calm but defiant denial.

“Yes, I can deny that I had any meeting with the Portuguese Soccer Federation. I am a loyal person,” he told reporters. “The only time I had direct contact with a club, I informed Fenerbahce. It wasn't now, it was in January.”

That moment — Mourinho's five-word phrase, “I am a loyal person” — quickly grabbed headlines. It poured cold water on reports of active talks, but many saw the denial as strategic rather than conclusive. Insiders suggest Mourinho is weighing his options, especially as the FPF is reportedly unwilling to pay the Yellow Canaries' release clause, complicating any immediate move.

The Portuguese boss is reportedly open to a mutual termination of his contract to facilitate the switch, should discussions become formalized after the Nations League.

With LA playing host to FIFA World Cup matches in 2026, the city's bars are bound to be packed. The city's soccer bars are rooted in the city's history as a sports capital and entertainment powerhouse. 

The city's earliest bars, like Big Dean's Oceanfront Café in Santa Monica, opened in 1902, welcomed beachgoers and sports fans long before flat screens and craft beer defined the modern scene. But the true blueprint for the American sports bar opened in Long Beach in 1979, when former LA Rams lineman Dennis Harrah opened Legends. The vision was to create a communal space filled with memorabilia where fans could watch games on giant screens and celebrate LA's teams together. Legends quickly became a hub not just for sports fans, but also for business deals and local 90s power brokers, reflecting LA's unique blend of commerce and celebrity. 

Today, LA's sports bars cater to every fans of every team and sport, from the Lakers to the Clippers, Dodgers, Rams, Kings, Sparks, and LAFC games, as well as UFC, March Madness, and international soccer. Bar menus reflect the city's international feel, with everything from English breakfasts as European bars to Mexican taquerias and African specialities. And naturally, the best LA sports bars have plenty of craft beers on tap. 

Whether you're a local or a visitor, these are the best LA soccer bars for watching the 2026 FIFA World Cup matches, no matter where in the city you're based.

The Fox and Hounds in Studio City is the official home of Arsenal Los Angeles, but its reach extends to nearly every Premier League supporter group in the Valley. The bar opens as early as wildly early at 4:30 AM for major matches, complete with an English breakfast menu and a lineup of British ales. Scarves and signed jerseys cover the walls, and the clientele is a mix of British expats and local die-hards who treat the bar as a second home. On North London Derby days (days when north London rival teams Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur match up), the crowd often spills onto the patio. The Fox and Hounds describes itself as “a proper British pub,” so you can count on being able to watch nearly every game at this LA soccer bar when the World Cup matches get underway in 2026. 

The Fox and Hounds: 11100 Ventura Blvd, Studio City, CA 91604

Joxer Daly's in Culver City is a longstanding headquarters for Liverpool and Arsenal supporters, with both clubs' official LA supporters' groups calling it home. Te soccer focus at Joxer's is evident as soon as you walk in, with banners, scarves, and match schedules plastered to the walls, and staff who are well-versed in the nuances of being an English soccer bar. Like The Fox and Hounds, this LA soccer bar also opens quite early for matches in Europe (an eight-hour time difference), and the Irish breakfasts are available just as early. Joxer Daly's also shows MLS and international games, and its location in Culver City makes it a convenient stop for fans from Venice, Santa Monica, and beyond. The bar regularly hosts themed events for finals and derbies, often with giveaways and club-specific drink specials, so it's extremely likely it'll have quite the party going on when the World Cup begins in 2026. 

Joxer Daly's: 11168 Washington Blvd, Culver City, CA 90232







A post shared by Tom's Watch Bar – Las Vegas (@toms_lasvegas)


It's pretty easy to tell from the name alone that Tom's Watch Bar is one of the most well-known sports bars in LA. It sits directly across from the Crypto.com Arena (formerly the Staples Center) and serves as the official LA Galaxy watch party venue. It's not joking around when it comes to watching matches, with more than 150 screens arranged in a 360-degree screen setup so every seat has a clear view. LA Galaxy hosts frequent events at Tom's, including player appearances, supporter rallies, and giveaways. Tom's carries the full “MLS Season Pass,” making it one of the few bars in LA to reliably show every MLS match, not just the Galaxy. The menu is group-friendly, with shareable plates and a rotating list of beers. On match days, the crowd is a mix of die-hard Galaxy supporters and neutral fans drawn in by the electric atmosphere and central location, so it's a good place to watch 2026 World Cup games no matter who you're rooting for.

Tom's Watch Bar: 1011 S Figueroa St b101, Los Angeles, CA 90015

Springbok Bar & Grill in Van Nuys is LA's only South African-owned soccer bar and an official bar partner of the LA Galaxy. Naturally, it shows every Galaxy match, as well as major international tournaments like the Africa Cup of Nations and the World Cup. The menu is also more exciting that your average sports bar, with South African specialties like boerewors rolls, peri-peri chicken, and biltong, alongside American bar classics. Regulars at Springbok include both local MLS fans and expats following the South African Premier Division; it also shows rugby and cricket when soccer isn't on the screen. The large outdoor patio is a draw for big match days, and the bar frequently collaborates with supporters' groups for themed events and charity fundraisers. Plus there's karaoke on Thursday and Sunday nights.

Springbok Bar & Grill: 16153 Victory Blvd, Van Nuys, CA 91406 







A post shared by Ye Olde King's Head (@yeoldekingshead)


Ye Olde King's Head in Santa Monica is a second home for British expats and Premier League fans in LA's western stretches. The bar opens early for Premier League matches, filled by supporters' groups for Tottenham, Chelsea, and Manchester United. That means the bar is generally filled with regulars, making it one of the best LA soccer bars to swing by when you're planning on cheering for England — or at least a team a key Premier League player is on. The pub's collection of memorabilia like signed shirts, historic photos, and club banners has been collected over time, reflecting its long history as a soccer destination in LA. There's even an on-site British that sells imported snacks and FC merch, plus afternoon tea service 'til 4 PM. 

Ye Olde Kings Head: 116 Santa Monica Blvd, Santa Monica, CA 90401 







A post shared by The Greyhound Bar & Grill (@thegreyhoundbarandgrill)


The Greyhound Bar & Grill in Highland Park is the official home of the Los Angeles Spurs, the supporters' club in LA for London's Tottenham Hotspur FC. The bar opens early for every Spurs match, with fans regularly filling the bar and spacious outdoor patio, even on early mornings. The Greyhound kitchen serves up full English breakfasts on match days, and the supporters' group makes sure big matches are celebrated. On match days, expect coordinated chants, halftime raffles, and special events for major fixtures — which means you shouldn't come in cheering for whomever the Spurs are up against. Like most LA soccer bars, the Greyhound also screens other Premier League and European matches, but Tottenham Hotspur matches will always take priority, with a crowd that knowns every song and stat. Fortunately, the Spurs will likely have several players fielding World Cup teams, so the bar will probably be lively throughout the 2026 matchups. 

The Greyhound Bar & Grill: 5570 N Figueroa St, Los Angeles, CA 90042



 



A post shared by Jonathan Wysocki (@jonathanwysocki)


La Chuperia in Lincoln Heights is the go-to place for fans of Liga MX and the Mexican national team. It's a popular gathering spot for supporters of El Tri (the Mexican national football team, nicknamed “La Tricolor,” or “La Tri,”) with every match shown on multiple screens, usually with commentary in Spanish. La Chuperia's walls are adorned with soccer memorabilia, and the energy is always high during Liga MX and El Tri matches, with fans chanting, debating lineups, and celebrating like they're in the stands at Estadio Azteca. The bar's signature micheladas, rimmed with Tajín, are a must-order for, who will likely be packing this LA soccer bar above all others when Mexico is playing. 

La Chuperia: 1145 N Mission Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90033



 



A post shared by Cork & Batter (@corkandbatter)


Cork & Batter is the closest true sports bar experience to SoFi Stadium, which will be hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup in LA. So whether you can't scalp a ticket or just want to be close to the action, it's the place to go. Cork & Batter is a three-story venue that meshes a modern sports lounge with a rooftop bar and restaurant, making it a versatile spot for before or after matches. Expect wall-to-wall TVs, and energetic crowd (especially before and after games), and an elevated bar food menu. The location near the games should make it lively during all the games, but it'll be absolutely wild when matches are across the street. 

Cork & Batter: 3900 W Century Blvd, Inglewood, CA 90303

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina continued his impressive season on Tuesday at the Bitpanda Hamburg Open, where he defeated Frenchman Gael Monfils 6-3, 6-3 to reach the second round at the ATP 500.

The Spaniard is 15-8 against Top 50 opponents this season and reached at least the quarter-finals in his two most recent ATP 500 events in Acapulco (final) and Barcelona (QF). Making his fourth appearance in Hamburg, Davidovich Fokina won 58 per cent of points on Monfils's second serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to improve to 2-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

The 25-year-old has won 22 tour-level matches in 2025, having earned 18 victories in all of 2024. Chasing his maiden tour-level title, the No. 26 in the PIF ATP Rankings Davidovich Fokina will next play Flavio Cobolli after the Italian beat Ukranian lucky loser Vitaliy Sachko 5-7, 6-2, 6-2. Cobolli won his maiden tour-level title on clay in Bucharest earlier this year.

For four and a half months last year, I did not touch a racquet. It was not for a reason you might expect, though.

It was because of my mental health. 

When it was bad, I started to forget things. My body was in one place, but my mind was somewhere else. It would go from something as simple as nearly forgetting my racquets to suffering panic attacks.

I knew it was going too far at Roland Garros, because what was happening in my head at tournaments began affecting my life outside the court. I could not sleep well to the point that I started having nightmares. I would wake up sweating with my heart pounding, and I couldn't breathe. It made me think I was going crazy.

I would wake up in the morning and go to practice, but I was not there. It became a matter of going through the motions. When it came time for my first-round match in Paris, it felt like I was not really on the court. I was not present except for my feet on the clay, so it was no surprise that I lost in straight sets.

I tried to take one or two weeks off to see if that would help before heading to Surbiton for an ATP Challenger Tour event on grass. Instead, I actually had a panic attack on court. I would tell you what it felt like, but I don't really remember the match. 

As you can imagine, these things were very scary. I started to have panic attacks off the court, including when I was driving. During Wimbledon, I needed to pull off the road, stop and get out of the car because it sometimes felt like I could pass out. I had no control. 

Somehow I made the third round of the tournament, but for half of my match against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, I mentally blacked out. I just remember wanting to run off the court. 

It was an absurd place to be — I was playing at one of the events I dreamt of competing in as a kid and all I wanted was to be somewhere else or somebody else.

Soon enough, I knew something had to change. Enough was enough.



#  #  #

The first time I spoke to a professional about my mental health was about 10 years ago, but my struggles became an issue more recently. 

Three years ago in Miami was the first time that I experienced a real panic attack. There is such a thin line between feeling normal nerves and something more. It is normal to be nervous for a match — you might start sweating, for example. Everybody has it different and that comes with sports, or really any profession. But this was something different. 

One morning in Florida I woke up and felt like somebody was strangling me. It was impossible to breathe. It was like somebody was stepping on my chest. 

We got in the car to head to the site and I couldn't speak. My mind was going crazy with a million thoughts swirling around. 

By the time we arrived, I was shaking. At that point, I was barely able to hold back tears long enough to tell my coach that I was not okay. I felt so terrible and did not know what was going on.

Somehow I was able to calm down a bit, went on court to face Maxime Cressy and won the match. Afterwards, I talked about it a little bit with my team, but not that much. I continued moving along. 

Once I stepped on the court, I was able to just switch it off and just focus on tennis. A couple of days later I pushed Jannik Sinner to a final-set tie-break. Nobody would have known what I had gone through.

I had recently made my first ATP Tour final in Pune and the following year I reached a career-high No. 37 in the PIF ATP Rankings. I was doing pretty well despite it all.

Part of the problem is that I learned the way to have success on the tennis court, and then I just followed that as long as it lasted. I was just keeping my mouth shut. Something was wrong, but I just continued doing what I had done for so many years. It was what allowed me to play tennis across the world, so it made sense, right?

Being a professional athlete, you try to survive any issues, forget them and just leave them behind in the hopes they go away. I was somehow able to do it, and that is the cruel part of sports. 

After Wimbledon last year, I started with a new team and attempted to play in Washington. When I went to bed, I started to have this feeling that there was someone else in the room. There was a kind of fear, a feeling that someone was there trying to harm me.

I beat Borna Coric in three tough sets, but the tennis was not the most difficult part. On match point against Borna, I thought in my head whether I should just double fault so that I could get out of there.

I traveled to Montreal but withdrew citing the stomach flu, but it was really because of my mind. I decided that was enough. I did not touch a racquet for four and a half months after that and some of those days were the toughest.

For the past 10 years, life was so consistent. There was always the next match, the next tournament. Everything was always moving and suddenly I did not have that anymore. That was a shock, because suddenly it was so boring and there was nothing to do.

I didn't really feel joy in anything anymore. I wasn't competing on court, and now I was fighting to get out of bed and honestly even had thoughts about whether I wanted to live, which was very scary. Even worse was how this affected those closest to me and how worried it made them.

I could not go on a tennis court, especially in Finland. I did not want to see people involved in tennis because I could not answer their questions. It was just a difficult situation.








Something that helped was playing quite a bit of padel. I felt like the two hours that I played were the only ones when I didn't think about anything else. I learned how important it was to have some things that interested me.

During the summer I began speaking to my psychologist once a week and told my very close family and friends what I was dealing with, which helped. One of my closest friends went through something similar, which made me realise that I was not alone in this. That gave me perspective.

That is a big reason why I decided to tell my story earlier this month on video in Finnish. It is very interesting to me to have this conversation with different people, trying to bring awareness to getting rid of this notion that it is somehow weak to talk about mental health. Everybody has these moments. It is about how you handle them.

When the video was released, it was like a weight dropped off my shoulders, because I felt like I was always pretending in front of people. It was so difficult. I could not do it anymore. I didn't feel like I could be honest and that was weighing on me.

I received a lot of very positive messages. Many different people with different jobs commented and you could see that it doesn't matter what you do. Everybody has their own struggles they need to overcome. Some people said it was brave of me that I did it and it helped them, and that meant a lot to me.

A good thing going through this process is that I became okay with the idea that I might not play again. Before that was not even an option. Everything was about my tennis and my career. But still, I always had the idea that I would come back. That wasn't even a question, it was just a matter of time. 

It took a while to get my body ready to be able to compete again, and my first tournament back was in February at an ATP Challenger Tour event in Tenerife. The first match was horrendous. It was just so difficult to be on court. The second one was a little bit better, but they have been up and down since.

It is still not always easy. Last month I went to South Korea and had one of my worst panic attacks. I woke up in the morning and my heart was beating way too fast. Before the match, I was in the shower and still felt so weird. My heart was like a car that was revving way too many RPMs. I was sitting and my heartbeat was 100 RPMs, and my normal resting heartbeat is around 37. That was not very good and you start questioning if it is worth it.

The difference is that now I just have the ability to help myself in these moments. When the thoughts start coming and going over the top, I have more tools to calm myself down. 

I was able to make my dream come true and become a tennis player. Because I achieved that goal, I had the mindset that I should just do whatever it took to keep moving forward. I didn't really talk about any mental problems because I saw them as a weakness. That's maybe the key word. It was something I felt didn't exist in sports and allowing anyone to see me vulnerable was showing that I was not strong enough.

I think the biggest change in me now is that if I don't want to be on court, I'm not going to force myself. You have to, a little bit, of course. You can't feel good every day in sports — that's not the point. It is a struggle, you need to overcome these challenges. But you just need to feel like there's at least some purpose and passion for it and then you can do it.

If my story helps even one person, then it will be worth it. My main hope is for people to know that you should take care of your mind and look after yourselves. That is the key. If you're not okay, there is no more important thing than helping yourself. Don't keep everything inside of you. 

It is okay to be sad. It is okay to have a bad day. But always remember one thing: tough times don't last forever.

Hubert Hurkacz lit up the courts on a rainy Tuesday at the Gonet Geneva Open, where he sealed his spot in the second round.

The sixth seed delivered a big-hitting performance to move past French wild card Arthur Cazaux 6-3, 6-4 on his debut at the clay-court ATP 250. Hurkacz, who was forced to sit through a rain delayed morning, hit 17 winners en route to an impressive 77-minute first-round triumph.

“I was waiting, seeing if it was going to rain [or] if it wasn't,” Hurkacz said of the delay. “We went to the gym in the morning, did some stuff, but didn't have an opportunity to hit before the match. But with the conditions here today, we just [went] straight out. [I'm] happy with the performance today, it was definitely not an easy match.”

Hurkacz is fresh from reaching the quarter-finals at the ATP Masters 1000 in Rome, and showed little sign of wear in Tuesday's clash. The 28-year-old Pole let slip a break lead in the second set, but reeled off four of the final five games to seal victory and improve to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Cazaux.

The former No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Hurkacz triumphed at the last clay-court ATP 250 event he played in Estoril last year, which is his sole title on the surface. He next faces Arthur Rinderknech, who delivered a statement 6-4, 6-2 victory over Miomir Kecmanovic.

Rinderknech dropped just six of 31 first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to earn his first Top 50 win since October last year. Fabian Marozsan was also victorious on Tuesday after he eased past Brazilian qualifier Karue Sell 6-1, 6-1 in just 45 minutes.

Borna Coric has been lighting it up on the ATP Challenger Tour this season, picking up four titles to rebuild his ranking inside the Top 100.The Croatian's ongoing resurgence didn't time favorably enough with Roland Garros, leaving him as the top qualifying seed. And on Tuesday, the former world No. 12 suffered a tough opening blow.Local hopeful Titouan Droguet, ranked No. 232, rose to the occasion inside Court Suzanne-Lenglen with a 5-7, 7-6 (9), 6-2 victory. Having failed to serve out the second set at 5-3, the 23-year-old later staved off two match points in the eventual tie-break before pulling away from Coric.

After two hours and 37 minutes, the hard-fought win belonged to Droguet.

Compatriot Arthur Gea is up next.For Coric, this marked the first time he lost in the first round of a major qualifying draw since 2014 Wimbledon as a 17-year-old.

Australia's 15-strong band of hopefuls in French Open qualifying has been trimmed by a third after the first day at Roland Garros. Bernard Tomic led three players into the second round, but five lost with seven still to enter the fray.

Jason Kubler and Maddison Inglis also won in Paris as they seek to join the 14 Aussies already guaranteed a place in the main draws. Qualifiers need to win three matches to secure their places.

Tomic, who has not competed in a grand slam main draw match since the 2021 Australian Open, beat Hong Kong's Coleman Wong 7-6 (7-2), 6-3. Once ranked No 17 in the world, Tomic is now a lowly 236rd.

Kubler, who has battled back to 210 in the rankings after missing most of 2024 with injury, scrapped his way past Spain's Alejandro Moro Canas 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 and Inglis took little more than an hour to dispense with Iryna Shymanovich 6-1, 6-1.

However, two men and three women went out on Monday.

Local wildcard Mathys Erhard beat James Mccabe 6-1, 6-1; Alex Bolt lost 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 to Pablo Llamas Ruiz; Arina Rodionova suffered a 6-2, 6-2 defeat to Czech teenager Tereza Valentova; Taylah Preston went down to American veteran Varvara Lepchenko, who at 38 is twice her age, 6-4, 7-5; and Priscilla Hon was narrowly beaten by Croatia's Jana Fett 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (12-10) in a draining two hours 45 minutes.

Playing their opening round matches on Tuesday will be Lizette Cabrera, Talia Gibson, Storm Hunter, Astra Sharma, Daria Saville, Li Tu and Omar Jasika.

Among other matches in qualifying former world No 4 and 2019 US Open winner Bianca Andreescu of Canada beat China's Xinxin Yao 6-0, 6-0.

Elsewhere, Daria Kasatkina's preparations for Paris were upset when she lost 6-1, 6-3 to former US Open champ Emma Raducanu in the first round in Strasbourg. But Ajla Tomljanovic gained an encouraging win in Morocco, beating fifth-seed Viktoriya Tomova 7-5, 4-6, 6-3.

When fans take in the sights and sounds of the qualifying rounds at the French Open at Roland Garros, they will see at least one well-known player participating: former US Open champion Marin Čilić. The 36-year-old Croatian, who peaked at No. 3 in the world rankings, won the 2014 US Open, and reached two more Grand Slam finals, is set to achieve a rare feat when he takes the court against Yibing Wu. Cilic is one of only two players—men's or women's singles—who have won a Grand Slam and later in their career taken part in Grand Slam qualifying rounds. Both instances occurred at the French Open.

The other example is 2010 French Open champion (and 2011 finalist) Francesca Schiavone, who had her best career results on clay. In 2018, her final year on tour, Schiavone's ranking had dropped enough to require her to enter the qualifying rounds. She successfully advanced to the main draw but lost in the first round to Viktoria Kuzmova in straight sets. Schiavone ended her career at age 37 with three consecutive first-round exits in Paris, despite her overall best Slam results being at Roland Garros. Her decline was notable: after reaching the 2011 French Open final, she never again advanced past the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam. This underappreciated grinder had largely faded from the spotlight following her memorable four weeks in Paris in 2010 and 2011.

Cilic's decline in form and ranking has not been as steep. His best result at the French Open actually came late in his career—in 2022, when he reached the semifinals after two previous quarterfinal appearances. His career prime spanned from 2014 to 2018, during which his aggressive style excelled on faster surfaces. It often took the skill of Roger Federer to prevent him from winning multiple majors. While injuries and age have slowed Cilic's career, his veteran knowledge of clay—gained from numerous battles against the likes of Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros—makes him one of the favorites to qualify and potentially cause an upset in the main draw. Cilic did win a Challenger Title in 2025, and set a record in the process, as it was nearly 18 years between Challenger titles.

Cilic's 2022 run saw him defeat Russian stars Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev, and in the third round, home favorite Gilles Simon, before taking a set off Casper Ruud and losing the semifinal in four sets. His win over Rublev came in a 5th set tiebreak that set the crowd alight for the intensity of the tennis and the upset nature of the result.

Hailing from Croatia, and never one of the flashiest names on the ATP Tour, Cilic hasn't enjoyed as many wildcard opportunities as other veterans with similar credentials. For example, two players of Cilic's generation—former Slam champion Stan Wawrinka and French favorite Richard Gasquet—both received main draw wildcards in Paris, but no such opportunity was available for Cilic. Recent retirees like Andy Murray, and Rafael Nadal, and other historical names like Lleyton Hewitt consistently received wild cards if they couldn't secure direct entry, while Cilic's countryman Goran Ivanišević notably won Wimbledon in 2001 as a wild card, a wild card he received due to his strong past performances on grass and at the Wimbledon tournament.

Fans will be watching closely to see if Cilic can conjure some magic in the earliest rounds of the French Open, where only the most dedicated tennis followers pay attention. You can't help but root for the likable and determined Cilic as he grinds through the twilight of his career.

The French Open is less than a week away and plenty of players are still hoping to fine-tune their games ahead of the second Grand Slam tournament of the season. Emma Raducanu took a late wildcard into this week's WTA 500 in Strasbourg and it more than paid off - she stunned No. 6 seed Daria Kasatkina in the first round and later opened up about her relationship with the surface.

Novak Djokovic is still seeking his first win on the clay in 2025. The three-time French Open champion lost his opening matches in Monte-Carlo and Madrid, then pulled out of the Italian Open. He is now competing in the ATP 250 event in Geneva, his first appearance since ending his coaching partnership with Andy Murray.

Meanwhile, Rafael Nadal is preparing to return to Roland Garros this weekend. The 14-time champion will be back on Court Philippe-Chatrier for the first time since ending his professional career last year.

Novak Djokovic has revealed that he is not in need of a new coach following his split from Andy Murray.

The Serbian has endured a tough start to the season and hopes to bounce back to form at the French Open without the help of a new coach.

He said: “At the moment, I'm not in need of a coach. I don't need to rush in any context. I feel comfortable with the people around me ... in the next few tournaments, and we'll see what happens.""

Former world No.1 and Rafael Nadal's former coach Carlos Moya is reportedly set to join Jannik Sinner's coaching team in 2026.

According to Russian media outlet Bolshe, Sinner is set to begin working with Rafael Nadal's former coach Moya in 2026.

Moya kickstarted his coaching career by joining Nadal's team in 2016 before stepping up as his sole coach when Toni Nadal stepped down from his position. During that time, they won six Grand Slam titles and continued to work together until Nadal retired from the sport.

Dan Evans came out on top in a battle of the Brits in French Open qualifying.

The former world No. 21 beat countryman Billy Harris 7-5 6-3.

Harris was the No. 6 seed in the qualifying draw.

Retired tennis legend Chris Evert has told Express Sport that coaching Novak Djokovic would have been an ""intimidating"" task for Andy Murray.

Djokovic and Murray ended their player-coach partnership last week, and the 18-time Major winner believes the Brit couldn't give Djokovic an ""edge"".

""How do you coach Novak, the greatest player of all time? How do you coach him? I think it's a very… intimidating job to be a coach of Novak Djokovic. And I don't know if Andy could give him the edge he needed,"" she said.

Marie Bouzkova's Strasbourg campaign came to an unfortunate end on Tuesday as she was forced to retire injured just 47 minutes into her second-round match.

The Czech star lost in qualifying but entered the main draw as a lucky loser and easily beat wildcard Alize Cornet in the first round.

But she couldn't continue against No. 3 seed Paula Badosa, calling it quits at 3-3 in the first set of their match.



Sara Errani partnered up with Jasmine Paolini to win the Italian Open women's doubles title on Sunday afternoon.

And less than 48 hours later, she's scored an impressive win in French Open singles qualifying.

The 38-year-old stormed back after being bagelled by Jule Niemeier, beating the 19th seed 0-6 7-6(4) 6-2.

Daniil Medvedev has entered the men's doubles draw at the upcoming French Open.

The singles world No. 11 appeared on the doubles entry list alongside Brazilian player Marcelo Demoliner.

It will be his first Grand Slam doubles participation since 2017.

Britain's Fran Jones scored a win in French Open qualifying, beating Lea Boskovic 6-2 6-3.

Danielle Collins caused a huge shock at the Italian Open earlier this month, taking out defending champion Iga Swiatek in the third round.

But the American has admitted that the big win wasn't all it cracked up to be, as her form was overlooked.

""I thought I played really well against Iga. I didn't get a ton of credit for it after the match, of course,"" she told T2.

""It was more about how poorly she played and everything. That can make it difficult to celebrate your win sometimes when you feel like you've played a good match and it's just like ugh whatever. I was happy about it, but it wasn't as fun as I imagined.""

There's been a massive upset on day two of French Open qualifying, as top seed Borna Coric lost his opening match.

A former world No. 12, Coric currently sits at No. 83 in the world and came into qualies in form after winning the Aix-en-Provence Challenger.

But he suffered a 5-7 7-6(9) 6-2 defeat to France's Titouan Droguet on Tuesday, blowing two match points in the second set.

It's been a strange season for Daniil Medvedev, who dropped out of the top 10 and has not won a title since the 2023 Italian Open.

A former world No. 1 and Grand Slam champion, Medvedev has failed to rediscover his best tennis in recent months. But he believes he could be close.

""At the best moments of my career, my game was based on counterattacking, especially on returns,"" he told Bolshe.

""I feel like I'm close to finding things on clay that will help me regain my best level on other surfaces. My goal is to be able to beat players like Ruud or Musetti, and I think I can achieve that if I keep working hard.""

It's been a tough day for the Brits so far in French Open qualifying.

Heather Watson suffered a 7-6(2) 6-2 defeat to good friend Daria Saville.

Jan Choinski also crashed out with a 6-4 7-6(5) loss to Italy's Giulio Zeppieri.

Fran Jones is currently in action while Brits Billy Harris and Dan Evans will face off later on Tuesday.

Novak Djokovic will take on Marton Fucsovics at the Geneva Open.

The Serb is yet to win a match on the clay this season, losing early in Monte-Carlo and Madrid before pulling out of the Italian Open.

He then entered this week's ATP 250 event in a bid to get more matches before the French Open.

Djokovic is the No. 2 seed in Geneva and received a first-round bye, while Fucsovics took out Zizou Bergs 6-2 6-3 in his opening match.

Djokovic has a perfect 5-0 record against the former world No. 31. He also competed in Geneva last year and reached the semi-final, losing to Tomas Machac.

Darren Cahill has spoken out after Jannik Sinner suffered a 7-6 6-1 defeat to Carlos Alcaraz in the Italian Open final.

Sinner was making his return from a three-month suspension and won five matches in a row, dropping only one srt to reach the final. But Alcaraz proved too strong.

Cahill took to Instagram to congraulate Alcaraz and his team before sending a message to Sinner.

""An amazing fortnight in Italy for all of us. Well done Jan. Exceeding expectations has become your norm, which is far from normal,"" he wrote.



Barbora Krejcikova has finally returned to competition for the first time since November.

The Czech star lifted her second Grand Slam title at Wimbledon last summer but she had not played a match since the 2024 WTA Finals, pulling out of several tournaments with a back injury.

She made her comeback in Strasbourg this week but lost her opening match to Magda Linette, though she was just happy to be on court.

""It was very difficult times last year with all that happened, all the ups and downs. Feeling good. Happy to be back,"" she told the WTA.

""If I finish the week and I'm pain-free with my back, that's my main goal.""

There are plenty of questions surrounding Iga Swiatek coming into the French Open.

The Pole is a four-time champion at Roland Garros and has not lost a match there since 2021. But it's been almost a year since she last lifted a trophy and she has dropped to No. 5 in the world following a shock early exit in Rome.

However, French Open tournament director and two-time Major winner Amelie Mauresmo believes Swiatek is still dangerous in Paris.

""Iga on this court is always dangerous. She's always going to be a problem to any player she's going to face,"" she told Eurosport France.

""Now, the fact that she's coming here with confidence being pretty low is probably something new for her. It's also going to be interesting to see how she reacts to this mentally.""



Nick Kyrgios has played just four events since returning from a two-year injury layoff on January but the Aussie is now set to ramp things up and will head back to west London for the grass-court season.

The former world No. 13 has signed up to the ATP 500 event at Queen's using his protected ranking of No. 21.

He is also set to compete in French Open doubles with Jordan Thompson before returning to singles action at the ATP 250 in Stuttgart.

Rafael Nadal will be back at Roland Garros this weekend for a special ceremony following the conclusion of the day session matches on Court Philippe-Chatrier on Sunday.

The 22-time Major winner has laid low since retiring during the Davis Cup Finals in November but he wanted to return to the most successful tournament of his career.

""I'm not much for tributes, but Roland Garros is obviously the most important place in my career, without a doubt,"" he told TNT ahead of the ceremont.

""So, if something big is to be done, it has to be there, or at least give them priority to do it there.""

Emma Raducanu got off to a triumphant start in Strasbourg on Monday afternoon, upsetting world No. 17 Daria Kasatkina 6-1 6-3.

The Brit is still relatively inexperienced on the clay but she confessed her ""relationship"" with the surface was improving.

""I think I've been building towards this. I had three great matches in Rome and to bring that level here, I'm really proud,"" she said.

""As I spend more time on clay I'm starting to like it more and more and building my relationship, let's say, with the surface.""

MANILA, Philippines—Alex Eala's rise in WTA world rankings continued on Monday ahead of her first main draw in Roland Garros.

In the most recent development, Eala notched another career-high spot as the 69th best women's tennis player in the world.

After competing in the Italian Open in Rome, the Filipino tennis ace improved one spot above her previous career-high of 70.

She exited in the Round of 128 at the hands of Marta Kostyuk, but her stint with American star Coco Gauff in the doubles helped her standing in the global ladder.

Gauff and Eala, though, fell short in the quarterfinals at the hands of eventual champions Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini.

After her run with Gauff, she also improved in the doubles ladder to No. 224 in the world ranking.

Eala now turns her attention to a Grand Slam bid when she enters the French Open as the 74th seed for the competition.

Tennis is a ‘fun hobby' for the player looking to add to grand slams won in SW19 and at the Australian Open

It's slightly unusual to hear Henry Patten – along with Harri Heliövaara, the reigning men's doubles champion at Wimbledon and the Australian Open – call tennis a “fun hobby”. But then you spend time in his company and realise he is slightly unusual.

Patten, 29, was not supposed to be a professional, never mind a grand slam winner. Though he played county level as a child, he enjoyed various sports as a teenager before a tennis scholarship to Culford School in Suffolk – “I don't know how we weaselled that!” – inspired him to attend college in North Carolina, where he read economics.

“We'd have two hours' training in the afternoon, a foreign concept to me,” he says. “That was where I learned how to be a professional without really understanding what was happening, because I was having a good time.”

Patten, a late developer missed at every level, evidences a flawed system. Though he acknowledges that “it's pretty tough to see a hundred 12-year-olds and say which'll be a champion”, even when he excelled in the US no one paid attention. “I came home and the first professional event, someone from the LTA came up and said: ‘Who are you?' I didn't know how to take that.”

So he agreed to join Ernst & Young as a technology risk consultant, but was saved by the pandemic, doing well enough in bubble events for his family to insist he pursued tennis seriously. “Thank goodness they talked me around otherwise I wouldn't be sitting here. A friend works at EY and he's absolutely miserable, whereas any time I'm upset or struggling, I can play tennis. It completely engrosses you and takes your mind off whatever else is going on.”

Patten's calm sense of perspective is striking, but a debut grand slam final is of a palpably different order – especially for an unseeded, unknown Briton in SW19. “The first time we played Wimbledon I was trying to act like I wasn't nervous at all, and we lost very quickly, so now I let the nerves be there,” he says. “But this time I couldn't stop smiling, it's the coolest thing ever. Walking down the corridor, past the trophies and underneath the Kipling quote, it feels like the absolute pinnacle of anything.”

Emerging to a crowd, though, is different – “You want that moment to last for ever, don't really want to start playing tennis” – and as the contest intensified into an unfathomable epic, the atmosphere became equally feverish. “The whole way we were clinging on desperately,” Patten tells me, “so I didn't feel much pressure until the last point, and Harri hit a great first serve – I didn't even touch the ball.”

After which, mayhem. “What was amazing was I had everyone in my box,” Patten says, “and they all had the same face on that I had on … the craziest, best feeling ever, a home crowd going completely ballistic, everyone's just nuts. To create those emotions in people, it's an absolute honour.”

In Melbourne, six months later, it was Patten tasked with settling another classic: “I felt a lot more pressure thinking blindly, ‘Serve it out, just serve it out.' I went completely blank so Harri came and said, ‘Your serve is great, serve here; I'm going to go here,' which usually the server would dictate. I served an ace and said, ‘OK, now tell me how to serve on this one.”

Before teaming up with Finland's Heliövaara, Patten partnered fellow Briton Julian Cash, eventually realising that he had to be ruthless to progress. “One of those difficult conversations you just have to have, and we had it. What's unusual is we're still friends and we've got seven Brits in the doubles top 50, which is unbelievable – it's a golden age.”

Doubles, though, suffers from a chronic lack of funding, coverage and care, despite proof – exemplified by Patten's experiences – that people love it. “It's a team sport, so you've got different tactics,” he explains when asked to pitch it. “You see a lot more variation in the shots – singles is mainly baseline rallies, but doubles has net play with quick hands, it's absolute carnage.

“Singles, you have a pretty strong idea of who's going to win, whereas doubles, everything's out of the window … I know friends of years who split up and hate each other. Fundamentally, you're dealing with extremely competitive 30-year-old men who travel the world together – it's a recipe for disaster!”

Patten also has a vision for change, citing padel as an example. “There's always a good energy. Most sports, the spectacle is great but it's really about being with friends and having a nice time, so you could turn doubles into something different, with music and free crowd movement. Doubles has a great chance of becoming this unique, fun event … if the authorities let it.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

NICK KYRGIOS has sparked controversy by posing for pictures with Aussie rapper Ay Huncho.

Huncho, real name Ali Younes, was bailed for AU$1.8million (£860k) following charges of alleged kidnapping and assault.

The rapper is said to have ties with the Alameddine crime syndicate.

Ay Huncho has been accused of being part of a group that lured a man to a drug house before ""ambushing"" them.

The man was said to have been forced into the property's garage before being left unconscious by an assault.

It was later heard in court that the victim did not co-operate with police, despite being left hospitalised with serious injuries.

Ay Huncho is alleged to have been heard laughing about the kidnapping in an audio tape.

There is nothing to suggest that Kyrgios has any ties to the Alameddine crime syndicate.

Per The Daily Telegraph AU, Kyrgios and Ay Huncho were pictured together on May 9 at Fiction nightclub in Canberra.

Kyrgios, 30, is claimed to have captioned the image: ""Keep waiting on it @ayhuncho.""

The post has since been deleted.

As part of Ay Huncho's bail conditions, he has been able to continue his tour of Australia.

He is set to perform in Adelaide on May 30.

Kyrgios, meanwhile, is looking to reignite his tennis career.

Having been plagued by a wrist injury, the former Wimbledon finalist has won just one tour match since October 2022.

Last year the Aussie worked at the All-England Club as a BBC pundit.

Kyrgios has not played since losing to Karen Khachanov in Miami two months ago.

The former world No13 is set to return to action at Roland Garros, playing alongside compatriot Jordan Thompson in the doubles event.

Earlier this year, Kyrgios split with long-term girlfriend Costeen Hatzi.

Having broken up with Kyrgios following four years together, Costeen said: ""We haven't spoken. Relationships sometimes end, and I believe it's for the best.""



Off the court, Kyrgios has built up his ""Good Trouble"" podcast.

The tennis star has confirmed that he will perform live at Wimbledon Theatre ahead of this year's Championships.

Young Tennis Sensation Joao Fonseca Unveils Intense Grass Season Schedule

As the tennis world eagerly anticipates the upcoming grass season, all eyes are on the rising star Joao Fonseca. After facing some challenges on clay courts, Fonseca is gearing up to showcase his skills on the grass courts, with a schedule that promises intense competition and thrilling matches.

Despite a somewhat lackluster performance in the red clay tournaments leading up to Roland Garros, Fonseca is determined to make a statement on the grass courts. The Brazilian prodigy has been diligently training since the Miami Open, aiming to hit his stride and deliver standout performances starting with the French Open.

Rather than opting for a tournament this week to fine-tune his game, Fonseca has chosen a different approach. He has been engaging in rigorous practice sessions with his team to acclimate to the conditions early in Paris, setting the stage for a formidable presence at the upcoming tournaments.

Looking ahead, Fonseca has already mapped out his schedule for the grass season. The young talent is set to compete in the ATP tournaments in Stuttgart, Halle, and Eastbourne before making his way to the prestigious Wimbledon Championships. With a lineup of challenging events ahead, Fonseca is poised to test his skills and continue his meteoric rise in the tennis world.

Despite his relative inexperience on grass courts, Fonseca has already left a lasting impression on fans and fellow players alike. His remarkable victory over Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open and his triumph in Buenos Aires have solidified his reputation as a player to watch. Even the likes of current world number 1 Jannik Sinner have recognized Fonseca's potential, hailing him as a special talent with the ability to reach the pinnacle of the sport.

As Fonseca prepares to navigate the intricacies of the grass season, he remains focused on honing his strengths and addressing any weaknesses that may arise. With the unwavering determination to succeed and the support of his fans behind him, Joao Fonseca is poised to make a significant impact on the upcoming tournaments and solidify his status as a rising star in the world of tennis.

IN 1877, Spencer Gore, a descendant of the Mayo Gores, etched his name in history as Wimbledon's first-ever men's singles champion.

Nearly 150 years later, another Irish talent connected to Mayo is making her mark at the prestigious tournament, this time, not with a racquet, but with a step pallet knife.

Originally from Tipperary, Paula Stakelum, better known as Paula Pastry, is based at the Ashford Castle Estate in Cong, Co. Mayo, where she serves as the Global Director of Chocolate & Pâtisserie for the entire Red Carnation Hotels group. This summer, she's bringing a distinct Irish flair to Wimbledon with two exclusive Paula Pastry x Lanson Champagne activations.

Paula is renowned for her ability to fuse heritage, storytelling and culinary artistry into edible masterpieces.

The award-winning pastry chef first collaborated with Lanson Champagne last summer with a special pop-up at The Rubens at The Palace hotel during Wimbledon, where guests indulged in a tennis-inspired dessert crafted from two of Britain's most-loved ingredients - strawberries and cream.

This year, Paula will take things one step further and will be showcasing some of her finest creations courtside at Wimbledon with guests of Lanson's corporate box treated to four exquisite afternoon tea pastries as well as a takeaway gift.

Paula's exclusive creations for Lanson's corporate guests include Wimbledon Court: A delicate layered shortbread, enhanced with zesty lemon curd and velvety vanilla cream, finished with a natural green-hued cocoa butter spray, crowned with a bespoke ‘PaulaPastry X Lanson' plaque. This dessert reflects the sophistication and prestige of Wimbledon.

Strawberries & Cream: A quintessentially British bakewell tart, elevated with a luscious layer of dulce caramel and crowned with a strawberry and Opaly's white chocolate cream. A magnificent take on a British classic.

Tennis Ball: A refined take on the iconic peach melba, featuring luscious peach, vibrant raspberry, and smooth vanilla, elevated with a delicate touch of Lanson Rosé Champagne. Enrobed in a velvety yellow cocoa butter spray to perfectly mimic a tennis ball, this creation celebrates the spirit of Wimbledon.

Legend: Legend chocolate was exclusively created by Paula Pastry in partnership with revered chocolate brand Valrhona and offers a 55% cocoa content, for a rich milk chocolate tasting experience. This decadent layered chocolate cake, enriched with a velvety Legend chocolate crémeux offers refined indulgence, crafted to leave a lasting impression.

Takeaway gift: A bespoke chocolate snack bar, filled with a delicate Lanson Rosé and strawberry gel, paired with a luscious woodruff-infused white chocolate ganache. The exterior is meticulously hand-painted in the iconic green and purple hues of Wimbledon, and base features the exclusive Paula Pastry X Lanson branding, a thoughtful memento marking an unforgettable experience.

In addition to Paula's afternoon pastry menu at Wimbledon, the Lanson x Paula Pastry pop-up at The Reubens at The Palace is set to return for 2025 with another must-try menu.

Running from June 30 to July 13, this exclusive dessert experience invites guests to indulge in The Sweet Serve by Paula Pastry - a delicate pistachio cake layered with zesty lemon curd and velvety pistachio cream, elegantly finished with a natural pistachio-hued cocoa butter spray. Served alongside a glass of Champagne Lanson Le Rosé Création 67, this indulgence is priced at £36.","{'href': 'https://www.con-telegraph.ie', 'title': 'Connaught Telegraph'}","tennis"

The United States Tennis Association (USTA) has announced an $800 million investment, unveiling plans to reimagine Arthur Ashe Stadium and construct a cutting-edge Player Performance Center to elevate the US Open's global stature and athlete experience in Flushing.

The investment, which represents the largest single investment in US Open history, will elevate fan, player and partner experience at the annual tournament at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, USTA officials said at a launch event at the Times Center at 242 W 41st St. in Manhattan on Monday evening.

Officials said the project will be funded entirely from the USTA's coffers and is scheduled to completed by the 2027 US Open, with work to take place across multiple phases.
USTA CEO Lew Sherr said spectators may not immediately notice a difference inside Arthur Ashe when the work is complete but said that is part of the idea. However, the work will also include noticeable upgrades to the stadium's concourses and suite levels, Sherr said.

The project will expand the number of courtside seats in the stadium from 3,000 to 5,000 by moving the venue's suite and club levels higher up and replacing the existing suites with new luxury suites. The new suites will also have access to enhanced dining options and hospitality spaces in addition to their own dedicated concourse, National Tennis Center Chief Operating Office Daniel Zausner said Monday.
He added that the project will reduce the number of seats in the upper loge and promenade by about 2,800, reducing the overall capacity of Arthur Ashe by up to 200 seats.
The work will also significantly expand the concourse for fans in the loge and promenade, expanding concourse space by 40% and increasing the number of retail options by 30%.
Zausner added that the project will increase the number of restrooms for promenade and loge guests by about 30% while also adding doubling the number of escalators and elevators in the stadium from two to four. Meanwhile, the project will also include an overlook bar on the newly-expanded concourse, offering views out over the US Open complex toward the Unisphere in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.
Zausner said the redevelopment of Ashe will “exponentially” improve the experience of fans in the stadium's upper levels by reducing the number of guests and adding more services. He noted that the loge and promenade areas currently make up more than 19,000 seats at Ashe and said the redesign will help bring fans closer to the action.

Plans also include a brand-new “visually-striking” grand entrance to the famous stadium.

The $550 million redevelopment of the iconic tennis stadium will be carried out by Rossetti, the architect firm behind the original construction of Arthur Ashe Stadium in 1997.







Meanwhile, the planned Player Performance Center will be built on the top two floors of a new four-story building on the west side of Arthur Ashe, providing players with expansive locker rooms, lounges, dining areas, a new player-only café and a dedicated entrance for players entering the US Open complex. It will also include indoor and outdoor fitness and warmup areas, featuring turf, track and US Open court surfaces for training.
The $250 million center will be housed above a two-story parking lot within the new four-story building.

Zausner noted that only eight to ten players would be playing on Ashe on a given day during the US Open and said the Player Performance Center is an effort to cater to all players and their staff. He said close to 2,800 players and members of their teams attend the event every year.







Tennis legend John McEnroe, a four-time winner at the US Open, said the new performance center would be a big hit among the players, adding that he experiences a pang of jealously when he sees the facilities available to modern-day pros.
“The players are going to love this,” McEnroe said Monday. “There's a twinge of jealousy and envy, but it's also pride, because, in a way, I'd like to think that we've all been part of this in a certain way.
“New York City is the greatest city in the world, and it only makes sense to have the greatest and biggest and the best.”
McEnroe also praised the USTA for enhancing the experience for guests in the loge and promenade portions of Ashe, stating that it is these fans who bring the energy during the famous night events on the iconic court.







“They're the diehards. They're bringing the energy,” McEnroe said. “There's no way anyone can tell you that Arthur Ashe is not rocking at night – it's rocking hard.”
Construction on the redevelopment of Arthur Ashe is already underway, with structural work reinforcing the column load for the venue ongoing since last fall. Officials said the work is mostly structural and will not be noticeable to fans attending the 2025 US Open but said it will allow the USTA to increase the concourse sizes across 2026 and 2027.
Phase Two of the project will take place between the 2025 and 2026 US Opens, with the USTA set to expand the courtside bowl before the 2026 event in addition to replacing existing clubs and suites with modern luxury suites.
The final projects in Arthur Ashe Stadium will be completed ahead of the 2027 US Open, including the completion of the new concourse for loge and promenade guests. The new grand entrance, designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, will also be completed ahead of the 2027 tournament.
Meanwhile, the USTA has already completed the first two stories of the new Player Performance Center, introducing a two-story parking lot ahead of the 2025 tournament. The center will be constructed ahead of the 2026 US Open but will not be accessible to players until 2027, with interior work set to be carried out between 2026 and 2027.
USTA officials said the work would not impact capacity or fan experience at Arthur Ashe Stadium over the next three years.
Asked if the $800 investment would result in a hike in prices for guests, Sherr pointed to expansions of Fan Week, a free week-long event that takes place in the week leading up to the main draw of the US Open. He said the event has been expanded significantly in recent years, noticing that fans will have free access to the mixed doubles championship for 2025.
He also stated that USTA underprices and subsidizes a significant number of tickets to make the event more affordable for more people.
“It's a mix. We are a major global sporting event, and for the best access at the later end of the tournament, the prices get quite high. We don't back away from that,” Sherr said. “We feel great about the value that we deliver to fans, and the marketplace certainly speaks with their with their wallets.”
Sherr said the project, which will be funded from USTA reserves and debt leveraged against anticipated profits from the planned redevelopment, will help the USTA to re-invest more money back into tennis across the United States.
He said tennis has experienced five years of continued growth in the US, moving from 17.7 million players in 2019 to almost 26 million players last year.
However, he said the growth has been so quick that there are now not enough coaches and courts to support people who want to get lessons and learn how to play the sport.
Sherr said the $800 million investment will help USTA reach its goal of reaching 35 million players across the country by 2035.
“Our investments are being redirected to make sure that we continue to support growth,” Sherr said. “These investments in the Open will allow us to generate profits into the future and maintain the profits that we have into the future to support the general mission.”
Zausner, on the other hand, said the redevelopment of Ashe would also represent the “rebirth” of the famous stadium to coincide with its 30th anniversary in 2027.
“When you come back in 2027 for the 30th anniversary, you will see a brand new Arthur Ashe stadium, both on the inside and outside,” Zausner said.

Zausner added that the project will increase the number of restrooms for promenade and loge guests by about 30% while also adding doubling the number of escalators and elevators in the stadium from two to four. Meanwhile, the project will also include an overlook bar on the newly-expanded concourse, offering views out over the US Open complex toward the Unisphere in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.
Zausner said the redevelopment of Ashe will “exponentially” improve the experience of fans in the stadium's upper levels by reducing the number of guests and adding more services. He noted that the loge and promenade areas currently make up more than 19,000 seats at Ashe and said the redesign will help bring fans closer to the action.

Plans also include a brand-new “visually-striking” grand entrance to the famous stadium.

The $550 million redevelopment of the iconic tennis stadium will be carried out by Rossetti, the architect firm behind the original construction of Arthur Ashe Stadium in 1997.







Meanwhile, the planned Player Performance Center will be built on the top two floors of a new four-story building on the west side of Arthur Ashe, providing players with expansive locker rooms, lounges, dining areas, a new player-only café and a dedicated entrance for players entering the US Open complex. It will also include indoor and outdoor fitness and warmup areas, featuring turf, track and US Open court surfaces for training.
The $250 million center will be housed above a two-story parking lot within the new four-story building.

Zausner noted that only eight to ten players would be playing on Ashe on a given day during the US Open and said the Player Performance Center is an effort to cater to all players and their staff. He said close to 2,800 players and members of their teams attend the event every year.







Tennis legend John McEnroe, a four-time winner at the US Open, said the new performance center would be a big hit among the players, adding that he experiences a pang of jealously when he sees the facilities available to modern-day pros.
“The players are going to love this,” McEnroe said Monday. “There's a twinge of jealousy and envy, but it's also pride, because, in a way, I'd like to think that we've all been part of this in a certain way.
“New York City is the greatest city in the world, and it only makes sense to have the greatest and biggest and the best.”
McEnroe also praised the USTA for enhancing the experience for guests in the loge and promenade portions of Ashe, stating that it is these fans who bring the energy during the famous night events on the iconic court.







“They're the diehards. They're bringing the energy,” McEnroe said. “There's no way anyone can tell you that Arthur Ashe is not rocking at night – it's rocking hard.”
Construction on the redevelopment of Arthur Ashe is already underway, with structural work reinforcing the column load for the venue ongoing since last fall. Officials said the work is mostly structural and will not be noticeable to fans attending the 2025 US Open but said it will allow the USTA to increase the concourse sizes across 2026 and 2027.
Phase Two of the project will take place between the 2025 and 2026 US Opens, with the USTA set to expand the courtside bowl before the 2026 event in addition to replacing existing clubs and suites with modern luxury suites.
The final projects in Arthur Ashe Stadium will be completed ahead of the 2027 US Open, including the completion of the new concourse for loge and promenade guests. The new grand entrance, designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, will also be completed ahead of the 2027 tournament.
Meanwhile, the USTA has already completed the first two stories of the new Player Performance Center, introducing a two-story parking lot ahead of the 2025 tournament. The center will be constructed ahead of the 2026 US Open but will not be accessible to players until 2027, with interior work set to be carried out between 2026 and 2027.
USTA officials said the work would not impact capacity or fan experience at Arthur Ashe Stadium over the next three years.
Asked if the $800 investment would result in a hike in prices for guests, Sherr pointed to expansions of Fan Week, a free week-long event that takes place in the week leading up to the main draw of the US Open. He said the event has been expanded significantly in recent years, noticing that fans will have free access to the mixed doubles championship for 2025.
He also stated that USTA underprices and subsidizes a significant number of tickets to make the event more affordable for more people.
“It's a mix. We are a major global sporting event, and for the best access at the later end of the tournament, the prices get quite high. We don't back away from that,” Sherr said. “We feel great about the value that we deliver to fans, and the marketplace certainly speaks with their with their wallets.”
Sherr said the project, which will be funded from USTA reserves and debt leveraged against anticipated profits from the planned redevelopment, will help the USTA to re-invest more money back into tennis across the United States.
He said tennis has experienced five years of continued growth in the US, moving from 17.7 million players in 2019 to almost 26 million players last year.
However, he said the growth has been so quick that there are now not enough coaches and courts to support people who want to get lessons and learn how to play the sport.
Sherr said the $800 million investment will help USTA reach its goal of reaching 35 million players across the country by 2035.
“Our investments are being redirected to make sure that we continue to support growth,” Sherr said. “These investments in the Open will allow us to generate profits into the future and maintain the profits that we have into the future to support the general mission.”
Zausner, on the other hand, said the redevelopment of Ashe would also represent the “rebirth” of the famous stadium to coincide with its 30th anniversary in 2027.
“When you come back in 2027 for the 30th anniversary, you will see a brand new Arthur Ashe stadium, both on the inside and outside,” Zausner said.

USTA

The United States Tennis Association (USTA) has announced a US$800 million transformation of the US Open site at Flushing Meadows in New York – the largest infrastructure investment in the tournament's history.

The centrepiece of the project will be a major renovation of Arthur Ashe Stadium alongside plans for a state-of-the-art player performance centre, to be named in honour of US tennis legend Billie Jean King.

The US$250 million two-storey player performance centre will be entirely self-funded by the USTA. The new facility is set to include indoor and outdoor fitness areas, expansive locker rooms and lounges promising a “spa-like experience” as well as indoor dining and a new, dedicated cafe.

Arthur Ashe Stadium upgrades include a new “grand entrance”, 2,000 new seats and luxury-level suites as well as renovations to the concourse, retail and dining areas. The new seats will be in the courtside-level bowl, and will take the arena's capacity to 25,000.

The project is to be self-funded entirely by the USTA, which earned US$559.7 million in operating revenue from the 2024 US Open. The project is being led by Matt Rossetti, the architect behind the original construction of Arthur Ashe Stadium and the upgrades to the venue in 2018.

USTA chief executive and executive director Lew Sherr said the upgrades would improve the experience for athletes and fans alike.

Sherr said: “This project enables us to maintain the greatest stage in tennis—Arthur Ashe Stadium—which was constructed more than 25 years ago, and modernise it in a way that will set it up for the next 25 years.

“It also provides us the opportunity to give the players that compete in that stadium an unparalleled space that will enable them to perform at their best and enjoy a higher level of luxury and comfort while they are off the court.”

Sherr added: “The US Open helps us to deliver on our mission—growing tennis to build healthier people and communities everywhere—by showcasing our sport on the global stage, and this reimagination will bring this presentation to an entirely new level.”

The upgrades, due to be complete by 2027, are expected to take place in three stages to avoid interrupting the 2025-26 US Opens. The first phase, which will take place before this year's Grand Slam, will consist of mostly ‘behind-the-scenes work' and structural work to accommodate the new performance centre.

For the second phase, which will commence at the end of this year's US Open and be completed in time for next year's event, the tournament will hope to have the lower section of the arena removed and replaced, and the player performance centre built, with further work to its interior to be completed in the final phase leading up to the 2027 edition.

This new project will add 2,000 seats and two new luxury suites to the iconic tennis arena.

The United States Tennis Association (USTA) has announced a major $800 million investment into New York City's  Billie Jean King National Tennis Center hub, which includes a “top-to-bottom” refurbishment of the iconic Arthur Ashe Stadium.

The venue, which hosts tennis' annual US Open, one of the sport's four Grand Slam majors, will be refurbished in stages so as not to disturb the 2025 and 2026 stagings of the iconic event, with construction set for completion for the start of the 2027 US Open.

Architecture firm Rossetti, the architects of the Arthur Ashe Stadium in its original form and the firm behind its 2018 revamp, will once again lead the modernization of the venue.

For the Arthur Ashe Stadium, already the world's largest tennis-specific arena, this will mean an expanded capacity with 2,000 more seats, luxury hospitality suites, and a 40% larger concourse with expanded food and drink, retail, and dining offerings around the venue also planned.

Elsewhere at the Tennis Centre, a new $250 million player performance center will be constructed to aid player development and enhance the experience of top-level athletes competing at the event.

This investment will be entirely funded by the USTA, with no public funding required, with USTA chief executive and executive director Lew Sherr stating: “This project enables us to maintain the greatest stage in tennis—Arthur Ashe Stadium—which was constructed more than 25 years ago, and modernize it in a way that will set it up for the next 25 years.”

As tennis has grown in recent years, so too has the US Open, which in 2024 attracted a record attendance of over one million fans for the first time.

The 1,048,669 total over three weeks marks an 8% increase over 2023, itself a record-breaking year, while attendance for the two weeks of 2024's main draw reached a new high of 832,640.

This made the 2024 championships at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center the first to surpass the seven-figure mark.

The 2024 edition was the first to feature a seven-day US Open Fan Week, which was attended by over 219,000 fans, featuring signature events and activities each day and night of the week.

A year prior, in 2023, a record TV audience was measured, with 3.4 million viewers on ESPN tuning in to watch US star Coco Gauff's maiden US Open victory, he most-watched women's final of all time on major sports broadcaster ESPN.

The men's final that year, a record-setting victory for Novak Djokovic, drew 2.3 million viewers, which was the most-watched men's final since 2019.

Though the 2024 edition fared less well, with the men's final notching 1.7 million viewers and the women's final 1.8 million, a carriage dispute between ESPN owner Disney and cable TV service DirecTV saw the pay-TV sports channel pulled from DirecTV amid the final week of the tournament, adversely affecting viewership.

Australia's 15-strong band of hopefuls in French Open qualifying has been trimmed by a third after the first day at Roland Garros. Bernard Tomic led three players into the second round, but five lost with seven still to enter the fray.

Jason Kubler and Maddison Inglis also won in Paris as they seek to join the 14 Aussies already guaranteed a place in the main draws. Qualifiers need to win three matches to secure their places.

Tomic, who has not competed in a grand slam main draw match since the 2021 Australian Open, beat Hong Kong's Coleman Wong 7-6 (7-2), 6-3. Once ranked No 17 in the world, Tomic is now a lowly 236rd.

Kubler, who has battled back to 210 in the rankings after missing most of 2024 with injury, scrapped his way past Spain's Alejandro Moro Canas 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 and Inglis took little more than an hour to dispense with Iryna Shymanovich 6-1, 6-1.

However, two men and three women went out on Monday.

Local wildcard Mathys Erhard beat James Mccabe 6-1, 6-1; Alex Bolt lost 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 to Pablo Llamas Ruiz; Arina Rodionova suffered a 6-2, 6-2 defeat to Czech teenager Tereza Valentova; Taylah Preston went down to American veteran Varvara Lepchenko, who at 38 is twice her age, 6-4, 7-5; and Priscilla Hon was narrowly beaten by Croatia's Jana Fett 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (12-10) in a draining two hours 45 minutes.

Playing their opening round matches on Tuesday will be Lizette Cabrera, Talia Gibson, Storm Hunter, Astra Sharma, Daria Saville, Li Tu and Omar Jasika.

Among other matches in qualifying former world No 4 and 2019 US Open winner Bianca Andreescu of Canada beat China's Xinxin Yao 6-0, 6-0.

Elsewhere, Daria Kasatkina's preparations for Paris were upset when she lost 6-1, 6-3 to former US Open champ Emma Raducanu in the first round in Strasbourg. But Ajla Tomljanovic gained an encouraging win in Morocco, beating fifth-seed Viktoriya Tomova 7-5, 4-6, 6-3.

The Internationaux de Strasbourg saw two top seeds win their opening-round matches on Tuesday, No. 3 seed Paula Badosa and No. 4 seed Elena Rybakina advancing over Marie Bouzkova and Wang, Xinyu, respectively.Badosa, who had been off the court since March due to a recurring back injury, was tied three games apiece when it was Bouzkova who was forced to retire due to injury. Rybakina followed Badosa onto Patrice Dominguez Court to post a 6-1, 6-3 win over Wang in 64 minutes.“Honestly, I'm a bit tired,” Badosa said on court after the match. “It was 3-3 but it was a very long match, as you can see, 40 minutes. It's always a battle with Marie and I feel very sorry for her with what happened because it was in the middle of the match, so it wasn't expected from her side.“I feel bad because it was a very good match, a lot of rallies. Me, I'm happy to be back after two months. It was a tough journey, so finally, being back and getting minutes on court, I really appreciate it. I'm still very far from my level but hopefully I can be there soon.”

Both Badosa and Rybakina made strong starts to the 2025 season but have struggled with injuries and inconsistency, respectively, since the spring.

Badosa was on course for a career-best season after starting the year with a run to the 2025 Australian Open semifinals. The result earned her a return to the Top 10, having peaked at No. 2 in the rankings back in 2022, but the back injury that nearly forced her out of the game last year returned ahead of the BNP Paribas Open in March and the Spaniard had been forced to miss nearly all of the clay court season ahead of Roland Garros.“This time, mentally it hurt, because I think I was playing the best tennis of my life,” Badosa said of the time off. “I was playing very well, feeling physically very well. So, stopping like this was tough for me, but finally I'm back and pain-free. I'm looking forward to next week, to playing here. It's my first time in Strasbourg.“As you know, I'm Spanish but I grew up in the north of Spain, so it's almost in France. I always played so much under-10 and under-12 in France, so I feel like half from here!”

F1 | Main Trailer

Dubbed “the greatest that never was,” Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) was Formula 1's most promising phenom of the 1990s until an accident on the track nearly ended his career.

Thirty years later, he's a nomadic racer-for-hire when he's approached by his former team mate Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), the owner of a struggling Formula 1 team that is on the verge of collapse. Ruben convinces Sonny to come back to Formula 1 for one last shot at saving the team and being the best in the world.

F1 The Movie also stars Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies and Kim Bodnia, and was shot during actual Grand Prix weekends as the team competed against the titans of the sport.

There has been a lot of intrigue recently about how an ingenious McLaren rear brake duct design is helping the MCL39 have better tyre temperature control than the others. At circuits which induce particularly high rear tyre temperatures, it has helped amplify McLaren's advantage.

Although the exact way the duct is configured internally is not yet widely known, the FIA has checked and confirmed that the design is in full compliance with the regulations and that it has no concerns about it.

Isack Hadjar has pinpointed exactly what he needs to work on after he was left frustrated with one particular element of his race at Imola, despite what he described as a near “perfect” Grand Prix that saw him finish ninth to pick up two vital points for Racing Bulls.

Hadjar's weekend did not start well, the rookie spinning into the barriers before beaching his car in the gravel in practice. He seemed to have put that behind him in Qualifying when he made Q3, only for an error on his final flying run to potentially cost him a couple of grid slots.

But he put all of that behind him with a superb showing in the Grand Prix – even if that did not go exactly to plan either.

Hadjar ran towards the front of the field for times on Sunday

“It was again a difficult start for me, we need to work on that and that is the main point. The rest was perfect,” Hadjar said.

“We couldn't have done better tyre management, the pace was strong, still not as fast as the Williams on the medium – we have some work to do there. But strategy was good so I'm happy.”

FACTS AND STATS: Verstappen's Imola record and Hamilton's best Ferrari result to date

Hadjar dropped two places off the line, but was able to make them up thanks to a good strategy that saw him rise all the way to sixth at one point – the Frenchman, like race winner Max Verstappen, able to pit first under the Virtual Safety Car and then secondly, behind the Safety Car to maximise his chances.

“Today's drive was good. Again, I'm a bit ***** about my start as it is something at the moment I have been struggling with but yeah there is more opportunity to learn and I'm happy with all the rest, with the performance.”

Lawson had a tough race and finished down the order 

His team mate Liam Lawson did not fare so well, starting from further down the order. Luck was not on the Kiwi racer's side in Italy, as he pitted well before the VSC and then had no realistic tyre options for the late Safety Car, instead limping to the end of the race on very old hard tyres in 14th place.

“Just pretty disappointed for everybody obviously on my side,” he said after the race. “We just got caught out by [the] VSC and Safety Cars today and unfortunately that's what's put us down the back so a difficult weekend.

“I try not to believe in luck honestly, but it has been pretty difficult recently so, as I said yesterday I will keep working hard and hope it turns around.”

Lawson is one of three drivers to have started every race this year and yet be without a point – the other two being Fernando Alonso and Gabriel Bortoleto. Hadjar though has amassed seven points and sits P14 in the drivers' standings.

The latest film in the Disney franchise hits theaters next summer.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


	Disney is unboxing more of its Toy Story 5 cast. 


	The studio announced Monday that Conan O'Brien has been added to the film's voice cast as Smarty Pants, a character that is new to the animation franchise. Andrew Stanton is directing Toy Story 5 alongside co-director McKenna Harris, while Jessica Choi produces the film.




Toy Story 5 is set to hit theaters June 19, 2026. Plot details have not yet been shared, but the movie will involve the toys dealing with modern-day kids' fascination with electronics.

	The Toy Story franchise launched with the original Pixar film in 1995 and features Tom Hanks as cowboy Woody and Tim Allen as space explorer Buzz Lightyear. The new film's voice cast also includes Ernie Hudson taking over the role of Combat Carl, with the character previously voiced by the late Carl Weathers. Toy Story 4 hit theaters in 2019 and surpassed $1 billion at the global box office, in addition to winning the Oscar for best animated feature.

	










			Popular on THR		







	The casting was announced at Disney's Licensing Expo presentation, and O'Brien confirmed the news via Instagram. “These films are amazing,” the star said in a video. “I can't believe this.” The podcast host jokingly added this his role is far better than that of Woody or Buzz: “It's the best character of them all.”

A post shared by Team Coco (@teamcoco)


	Disney CEO Bob Iger first announced Toy Story 5 in February 2023 on the heels of franchise spinoff Lightyear — which features the voice of Chris Evans as the human who inspired the toy — underperforming when it was released the summer prior.


	In an interview late last year with Collider, Allen teased that the new movie has a “very, very, very clever story.” He added at the time, “Had they not come up with a brilliant script, they wouldn't have done it, and they wouldn't have called me and Tom [Hanks]. It's really clever.”


	Pixar is riding high following the massive success of Inside Out 2, which was the highest-grossing title of 2024. Next up for the company is Elio, which is also a story of space exploration and is set for theatrical release on June 20.

""This is not a show that needs a male savior"": The actors, co-showrunners and more speak out about the fatal second-to-last episode of the Hulu drama.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


[This story contains MAJOR spoilers from season six, episode nine of The Handmaid's Tale, “Execution.”]


	There's no such thing as a good Commander.




The Handmaid's Tale‘s writers have been passing along that message to viewers throughout the sixth and final season of the Hulu series. When Nick (Max Minghella) shocked his lover June (Elisabeth Moss) with the Jezebel's betrayal, her husband Luke (O-T Fagbenle) argued it's because he's a Nazi. When Wharton (Josh Charles) surprised his new wife with a handmaid on their wedding night, Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski) remembered June's warning: Wharton can't be a good man, because he's a man of Gilead.

	Yet killing three High Commanders is still a shocking final-season surprise: In the penultimate episode, titled “Execution” (written by co-showrunner Eric Tuchman and directed by star Elisabeth Moss), Nick Blaine, Joseph Lawrence (Bradley Whitford) and Gabriel Wharton all perished. Lawrence was planning to plant an altitude-triggered bomb on a plane of High Commanders and flee while working with June and the Mayday revolution to take out some of Gilead's most extremist male leaders. But when Wharton (Charles) and the others arrived early, Lawrence made a self-sacrificial choice to get on the plane and carry out his agenda. At the last minute, Nick joined them on the plane.


	The poignant final scene between June allies Nick and Lawrence saw Minghella and Whitford, who are close friends in real life, reflecting about the heroic former handmaid. Lawrence knew it was their final conversation; Nick did not. “She told me to give all this up,” Nick said to Lawrence, who replied, “You should have listened to her.” Lawrence had a touching goodbye with June before he stepped on the plane, but Nick and June — the show's biggest romance since season one — never got that moment. When June watches as the plane explodes in the sky, her emotions, conflicted and raw, also speak for the audience.


	The deaths are a turning point in the final season resistance against Gilead. Earlier in the episode, the majority of the female cast was nearly wiped out when June, a newly revolutionized Aunt Lydia, undercover CIA agent Aunt Ava (D'Arcy Carden), Moira (Samira Wiley), Janine (Madeline Brewer) and other handmaids were almost hanged to death as punishment for murdering Commanders in episode eight's wedding night coup. But just as June screamed the handmaids' rallying cry, “Don't let the bastards grind you down!,” Luke, former Martha Rita (Amanda Brugel) and Mayday fighters arrived to save June and the women as planes invaded the Gilead-run Boston.

	











	Below, in separate conversations with The Hollywood Reporter, Minghella, Whitford, Moss, show creator Bruce Miller, Tuchman and season six co-showrunner Yahlin Chang, and executive producer Warren Littlefield share how they decided on and carried out a moving end for two of the show's most influential characters as the series heads into its final episode.


	***


ERIC TUCHMAN [writer, season six co-showrunner] We decided on Nick and Lawrence's deaths when we were first breaking the season. Once we decided on Nick's betrayal midway, that led to his fate — and Lawrence's combined with that. We pitched the season to Hulu, MGM [Television], Lizzie [Moss goes by “Lizzie”] and all the creatives, their deaths included. Hearing that part of the pitch made Lizzie raise her hand and say, “I want to direct that one, too.” She was already directing the finale. She was on board immediately, as was Max.


ELISABETH MOSS [“June/Offred,” executive producer, director] I was in Paris shooting The Veil when they pitched us the whole season, outline by outline. I hung up from that meeting, and I said, “I have to direct episode nine.” I humbly requested and they very kindly said yes. If Nick and Lawrence are going to go, it has to be me.


TUCHMAN It's such a huge moment in the show. It hopefully has a lot of impact. She recognized that would be really juicy to direct. 


YAHLIN CHANG [writer, season six co-showrunner] Lizzie pitched it to Max first on the set of their indie movie Shell [directed by Minghella that starred Moss]. She told him something like, “You're going to die in the coolest way.” (Laughs) So she kind of prepared him.

	











MAX MINGHELLA [“Nick Blaine”] We shot Shell right before this final season. We'd been working together for quite some time and she was letting it slip as to what the direction of the season was going to be, and she was very excited about it. So I was clued in quite a long time before I even read the scripts.


TUCHMAN Max recognized it was a very honest look at his character, and that we're not trying to idealize or romanticize Nick anymore. To Max's credit, he really embraced everything.


MINGHELLA Nick was under tremendous pressure and when people are under pressure, they don't always think rationally. I think [when Nick told Wharton about the Jezebel's coup] that he assumed Wharton knew the answers already, and that it was a test more than an actual interrogation. I think Nick genuinely didn't anticipate what the consequences of that conversation were going to be, and I don't think he would have given those answers if he had known the implications.


BRUCE MILLER [creator, writer, executive producer] Nick meant a lot to June, but all the other things that he was were not really things that would connect with her. Max has been amazing at playing a character who is a citizen of Juneland. Nick doesn't really have loyalties anywhere else and that catches up to you in a place like Gilead. If you're not loyal to one side or the other, you're in danger from both sides.


TUCHMAN In The Handmaid's Tale book [by Margaret Atwood], I don't think Nick speaks. And in the pilot, he has very little to say. You get the vibe between him and June that there's something cooking, but going off of just that as an actor, you wouldn't know. It'd have to be a big leap of faith that the writers are going to do right by you. That's to Max's credit that he saw that from the beginning.

	











MINGHELLA It's bizarre how much I liked playing Nick. I don't think we're particularly similar, but I found him very comfortable to play. This is a very poignant way to end to me. I felt like a grounded version of Nick, and what I was really impressed by was how much it was not what I thought it was going to be. It's such a compliment to everybody who works on the show that they came up with something really inventive and still very much within the context of the show. I think the turn was in the decisions he made in that scene with [wife] Rose [in the hospital]. I looked at it as a morality play. The moment you make a psychological decision like that, the world will karmically punish you for it, certainly in the context of this story.


MOSS I feel like Nick was not the person June fell in love with. So as much as she can mourn the loss of the person she fell in love with, it won't trump the loss of the women [who were killed] at Jezebel's. But there is pain there, too. I'm not going to say there wasn't complexity to seeing him at that wedding and June not knowing what was going to happen to him next. Of course, there's a lot of complexity [seeing him step onto the plane].


MILLER I know it's controversial, but it felt inevitable that June was going to lose Nick this way. They're fighting on opposite sides and eventually, one of them is going to come upon the other at a time where they could die or sacrifice themselves. Gilead is a terrible, brutal, death-filled world, and there's a lot of loss. Part of Nick's backstory is that he was very involved in Gilead's version of January 6. He's considered one of the OG people who wasn't going to be forgiven by the U.S or Canadian governments. He put his lot in with those people.

	











CHANG There are certain things about Nick that June is blind to and that our viewers, and we as writers, are blind to because we're invested in this romance. For Nick to have risen to be part of the Gilead power regime — to be an Eye from the beginning, all the way through to becoming a Commander — he has done some bad things and we haven't shown them so it was convenient to forget. But one of the themes  this season, which you see with Wharton and Nick, is that there is no such thing as a good Gilead Commander. If you're a man who is powerful in Gilead, it means you are touched by some of that Gilead corruption.


MINGHELLA I'm only reading scripts I'm acting in, so I wasn't fully conscious of this more malevolent side to Nick. It was definitely a surprise reading how the show's perspective on him shifts so dramatically in season six. But I saw it as a way to explore a facet of this character that I haven't played yet, and that's a pretty interesting thing to get to do six seasons into a series. I'm working now on something that is incredibly consuming, so I've been healthfully distracted. But I hope more than anything people find the narrative overall to be satisfying. It's been a real labor of love for all of us. Everyone had the best intentions to deliver something that would be first and foremost unpredictable, and hopefully satisfying.


MOSS I do think Nick really loved Nichole [who is now going by her real name, Holly]. I think June will tell [her and Nick's daughter] all of the good things about her father. She'll tell him how much she loved him and how much he loved her. She'll tell him how much her parents loved each other and that ultimately, I think he would have done the right thing if he had gotten the chance to do it again.

	











MILLER June and Nick's relationship was amazing. I think their love was amazing, and so unexpected. And it almost saved Nick. He almost made it. June saw a really wonderful side of him, and that was a side we [the audience] saw almost all the time, but he was that guy from the beginning. He was a fucking driver. He was in the Eyes — he was the Gestapo. He's a survivor, but he's not much of a power player, and people like Nick get killed when they get to the top because other people want that power, whether it's Mayday or whether it's the other commanders allowing Mayday to blow that plane up. 


BRADLEY WHITFORD [“Joseph Lawrence”] I'm playing this guy who has done some really horrible things, but you could always tell a redeemable part of him was there. I also know that the show needs a villain, and I didn't know where this guy was gonna end up. But I was rooting for him to end up on the right side of history. This creative experience means a lot to me. This book means a lot to me. This unfortunate cultural relevance of the show means a lot to me. So there was a lot of anxiety. I've had so much luck in my career in not pestering writers, but I was so worried about it that I set up a meeting with Yahlin and Eric.


CHANG Bradley came to have lunch with the two of us [after season five]. He was concerned about what was going to happen to Lawrence. He really didn't want Lawrence to be evil. He didn't want him to descend into that for the finale season. We had already figured out what we were going to do with him and how he would die, and Bradley was relieved. He was so in from the moment Eric pitched it.

	











WHITFORD It was basically my fantasy of his trajectory. Because, it can't come too easy. This is not a show that needs a male savior (laughs). Lawrence is one of these intellectual guys and he was so excited about this idea of New Bethlehem that it sort of happened again where he got seduced by power and flattery. Even though he has contempt for these guys [the other High Commanders], his savior complex blinds him to what is a pretty obvious possibility, that those guys were gonna turn on him [which is why he decided to help Mayday].


TUCHMAN When you're going to kill off characters, you want them to go out with a bang. You want to have it land in a big way. Literally, in this case, Max and Bradley — and Josh Charles also explodes — all three of them have a very memorable end. 


MOSS With the final season, we were all [from Hulu and MGM to the executive producers] constantly making sure the show moved forward. Do we end in a different place than we began? Don't be stagnant. Keep going forward, because this is it. There's 10 episodes left to get to the end. No character this season ends in the same place that we begin.


WHITFORD So I knew what was going to happen, but I hadn't read it yet. We were shooting another scene and Lizzie said, “Do you wanna read it?” I said yes. But other people [on the cast] hadn't seen it yet. When they got the script, Ann Dowd left a very sweet message. She just thought it was beautiful.

	











TUCHMAN The moment when [Lawrence] turns to June when he's about to step on the plane, I scripted it as a little salute, which is nowhere near as moving as what Bradley did. That moment guts me every time. His expression, his gesture to her, is so emotional. Then to see the way he's sitting on that plane, knowing what's about to happen is powerful.


MOSS That was Brad's idea. The hand over the heart [really got me]. I mean, I've known Brad for 25 years. What matters absolutely the most to me is that the people I am working with feel like they are proud of what they're doing. That they're doing their best work. They're allowed to push themselves. That they have the space to do that and have a voice in the room, on both sides of the camera. That is truly what it's about. 


WARREN LITTLEFIELD [executive producer] The look as [Bradley is] getting onto the plane, it breaks your heart — and this is an architect of Gilead. Gilead does not come to life without Lawrence's brains, and now we have pain and anguish for the loss of this man. That's a remarkable journey. It's a tribute to everything the writers discovered and what Brad did, how he brought that character to life.


WHITFORD That [gesture was] one of those things where you don't know what's going to happen until you're doing it. I'd seen [the gesture] before. A friend of mine did that to a coffin of a loved one at a funeral and it was always a very moving thing to me. I also think it's an extension of what this experience with Lizzie has meant to me and the creative long-term bond I feel with that woman [starting with The West Wing]. That wasn't the last scene we shot, but it was getting there.

	











MINGHELLA It was really a blessed and wonderful way to finish, to have Lizzie directing my last scene in the show. It was fitting to finish with Brad, too.  We've become so close. I just adore him. I didn't know him before The Handmaid's Tale, and now I consider him one of my nearest and dearest friends. To do our last scene together was perfect.


WHITFORD The last scene we shot was on the plane. I felt off, because I was just dreading it. It meant a lot to me to be directed by Lizzie, sitting next to Max. Max is the dearest soul to me. These are both young people who really inspire me. I feel this kind of paternal ache with both of them who have been responsible for this very lucky older guy's incredible creative experience. The [Toronto] crew is the sweetest crew on the planet — despite whatever [President] Trump may think of Canadians — and I just didn't want to say goodbye. I know how rare it is. These shows are alchemy. I get emotional even talking about it.


	I was very happy that Lawrence made the choice that he made. I think as he's listening to Nick and sitting on the plane [in the final scene] he's thinking, “This poor kid is another victim of this hellscape that I created.”


LITTLEFIELD Finales are unbelievably difficult, because fans are passionate. You don't want to disappoint. Some really great shows have some not wonderful endings. But I feel very, very good about where we went this season and what we did with the final episode, and the new journey we're now on with [sequel series] The Testaments. Eric and Yahlin had to very carefully land this plane and allow us to take flight with The Testaments. That was a lot to navigate, but they did it.

The 'Thelma' actress plays an older woman who tells a lie that takes on a life of its own in a film co-starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Erin Kellyman and Jessica Hecht.


							By 

	Lovia Gyarkye


Arts & Culture Critic


	In her directorial debut Eleanor the Great, Scarlett Johansson tries to shape a portrait of aging, loneliness and grief in America through the misadventures of her eponymous protagonist, played by the reliably funny June Squibb (Thelma). You want Eleanor the Great to succeed because of its charming lead and compelling premise (the screenplay is by Tory Kamen), but it struggles to find its groove. The film lurches between comic set pieces and more dramatic beats, and while Johansson proves a competent helmer, it's not enough to overcome some dizzying tonal imbalances. Still, at the very least, Eleanor the Great offers a character-driven break from the glut of sequels, prequels and whatever else studios squeeze out of existing IP.

	The film, which premiered in the prestigious Un Certain Regard sidebar, strikes me as a peculiar choice for Cannes. A more fitting venue for this feel-good movie might have been Sundance or TIFF; its strengths recall the mid-budget comedy-dramas of the 90s — charismatic lead, relatively strong supporting actors and a story that's comforting in its predictability and mandatory suspension of disbelief.

The Bottom Line

	
	Compelling premise, uneven execution.
	



Venue: Cannes Film Festival (Un Certain Regard)Cast: June Squibb, Erin Kellyman, Jessica Hecht, Rita Zohar, Chiwetel EjioforDirector: Scarlett JohanssonScreenwriter: Tory Kamen

									Rated PG-13,
								1 hour 38 minutes			






	The film follows Eleanor Morgenstein (Squibb), a 94-year-old woman forced to return to New York and move in with her daughter Lisa (Jessica Hecht) after her best friend Bessie (Rita Zohar) unexpectedly dies. The transition proves difficult when the nonagenarian realizes that no one has any time for her. In an attempt to find community, Eleanor looks for activities at her local Jewish Community Center, where her daughter has signed her up for singing classes. An awkward misunderstanding lands her in a group for Holocaust survivors, and instead of correcting the mistake, Eleanor adopts her dead best friend's Holocaust survival stories as her own. This leads Eleanor to befriend Nina (Erin Kellyman), a 19-year-old journalism student who wants to write about Eleanor's experiences. 


	It's a bold premise that could have worked better. Eleanor the Great attributes the titular character's dubious actions to grief and isolation. But that framing isn't asserted early or forcefully enough to be convincing, so what might have been a fascinating and somber study of an elderly woman seeking connection after the death of her closest friend becomes an uneven and sometimes trying chronicle of a pretty weird scheme. Stronger and more meaningful points in the film involve Eleanor undergoing a second coming of age by preparing for the bat mitzvah she never had as a child and striking up a friendship with Nina. 

	











Eleanor the Great opens with a great sequence that establishes Eleanor and Bessie's life together. The two women have been friends for decades and decided to share a small house in Florida after their respective husbands died. Their routines include early morning chats over coffee, weekly runs to the grocery store and watching their favorite anchor Roger (Chiwetel Ejiofor) on the evening news.  


	Johansson's direction is assured here, establishing the intimacy between these two older women with the kind of endearing eye usually reserved for stories about girlhood. These and some other, later moments in the film reminded me of how Sarah Friedland captured aging as its own coming-of-age in her brilliant debut Familiar Touch. Working with DP Hélène Louvart (La Chimera), Johansson, like Friedland, represents becoming an elder as an equally energizing chapter of adulthood.


	When Bessie dies, Eleanor is gutted and feels unmoored. More scenes of the nonagenarian grappling with the realities of that mourning would have strengthened the film by offering a more persuasive foundation for her later decisions. Instead, Johansson moves quickly, and before we know it Eleanor is returning to New York to live with her daughter and grandson Max (Will Price). It doesn't take long for her to realize that neither Lisa, who is reeling from a divorce, nor Max, a teenager, has much time for her.


	Eleanor ends up at the Holocaust survivor group by complete accident, but she doesn't remedy the misunderstanding, because she prefers the community within that group to the theater adults in the singing class Lisa signed her up for. In a spur-of-the-moment decision, when prompted to introduce herself, she adopts Bessie's biography as her own. 

	











	Nina, a journalism student looking for her next story, is deeply moved by Eleanor's falsified narrative about escaping from Poland and coming to the U.S. Although Eleanor initially rejects Nina's pleas for a profile, the cub reporter's persistence pays off. The two embark on a sweet friendship that I wish had more time to gestate. Nina's mother, who was Jewish, recently died, and her father (who Eleanor doesn't know is the news anchor, Roger) is too subsumed by his own sadness to pay attention to her, so the relationship with Eleanor becomes a source of real comfort. 


	The comedic elements of Eleanor the Great work mostly because of Squibb's solid performance as the sometimes cantankerous and slightly overbearing mother. At 94, her character is still relatively independent and spiky, and it's funny to watch her snap at younger people who assume otherwise. 


	Things start to get shaky when Johansson dials down the comedy to lean into more serious turns. The shift is bumpy in part because the performances don't align with the new, theoretically heightened stakes of the story. Eleanor's dishonesty puts her in more precarious situations, including having to speak to journalism students about ethical storytelling and a local news channel's interest in airing a segment about her.


	The introduction of an additional thread about Roger and Nina's relationship is sweet, but doesn't have much time to develop, which only highlights how underused Ejiofor and Kellyman are. These new plotlines clutter up Eleanor the Great where condensing might have been a better choice. Most disappointingly, we never really get a good sense of Eleanor's interior life, which means that the film's ambitions ultimately feel unfulfilled.

Check out pics of the BTS singer in the midst of his solo run.

	Billboard Korea


Best known as a dancer, rapper and singer-songwriter in BTS, j-hope has long stood out, with a magnetic stage presence and captivating dance moves that helped propel the group to global stardom. Now — as ARMY around the world anticipate the group's remaining members completing South Korea's mandatory military service and BTS reuniting in June, with group activities on hold until 2026 — the charismatic 31-year-old is distinguishing himself further, carving out a bold solo identity that showcases a versatility and creative range that extend far beyond his BTS persona.

Following his 2022 debut solo album, Jack in the Box, which peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard 200, and his 2024 Hope on the Street, Vol. 1 EP that rose to No. 5 on the chart, j-hope has already released collaborations this year with stars including Miguel, Don Toliver and Pharrell Williams. And with his Hope on the Stage World Tour, which kicked off Feb. 28 in Seoul, j-hope is reaching new heights: His show at Los Angeles' BMO Stadium made him the first South Korean male solo artist to headline a U.S. stadium. (His bandmate Jin will hit the road this summer.) The tour — which will wrap June 1 after visiting 15 markets across North America and Asia, including a May 31 show in Osaka, Japan, that will be broadcast live to cinemas around the world — has mirrored his own artistic growth as he prepares for the next stage of his solo journey with his upcoming album. J-hope sat down with Billboard Korea in Los Angeles for an exclusive chat about his music, touring and inspirations.

	Grab your synthesizer, pink wig and star earrings – Jem is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. To commemorate four decades of Jem and the Holograms, Hasbro is releasing a new album of Jem and the Holograms songs.

	The series – which ran from 1985-1988 and inspired Jon M. Chu's live action 2015 film Jem and the Holograms – combined music, sci-fi and a storyline that more than like inspired Hannah Montana (Jem is the secret rock star alter ego of Jerrica Benton). The show's '80s fashion was truly outrageous (truly, truly, truly outrageous) and its glimmering synth-pop tunes were, as the Jem theme song promised, undeniably “contagious.”

Billboard can reveal that in July, a 40th anniversary album for Jem will come out on vinyl and digital streaming platforms via Hasbro. The project includes six re-recorded tracks from the ‘80s series, held down by the original singing voice of Jem, Britta Phillips.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Seriously, I was thrilled to be asked to sing these songs again,” Phillips tells Billboard. “I had listened to and sang many Jem songs at Jemcon last year, so they were very fresh in my mind. And I'm so excited for the Jem fans to hear them.”


	Those six songs are the Jem theme song, “Only The Beginning,” “Truly Outrageous,” “Like A Dream,” “I Got My Eye On You” and “She's Got The Power.” You can listen to “Jem and the Holograms Theme (Reimagined)” right now thanks to a glamor and glitter, fashion and fame-filled music video below.


	Listening to the reimagined theme song, it's hard to believe this is Phillips' voice four decades later – she sounds almost exactly the same as she did on the O.G. series. That's especially impressive when you spin her post-Jem music, such as her 2016 album Luck or Magic, which found her adopting a more mature, dreamy vocal tone. But it seems that the spirit of Jem was still inside her, ready to return (even without the help of supercomputer Synergy).


	“I took a couple of voice lessons before the recording sessions which helped with my confidence in belting those crazy high notes, but luckily the sound of my voice and my vocal range hasn't changed much. It's still pretty girlish,” Phillips tells Billboard. “To my surprise, the high notes weren't difficult. We even kept the songs in the original key except for one track where we dropped down a half step – and that one didn't have the highest notes. The biggest challenge was singing at such fast tempos (the original tempos), but it was very exciting and nostalgic for me, and I had a blast! And working with these amazing and talented producers (all female!) was inspiring,” she adds, tipping to the female-led team behind this anniversary album.

	











	Of the re-recorded songs, Phillips says “Only the Beginning” – a song that appeared in the series pilot, which aired Oct. 6, 1985 – was “the most emotional one to sing. It brought me back to my beginning and so it felt like a full circle of my life from the very beginning of my musical career to the present.”


	Phillips says returning to “She's Got the Power” was also exciting for her. “It felt much like it did when I first recorded those songs, except now I know those little kids I sang to are all grown up! Makes me a little teary.”

""It's such an honor to be able to use her music in the final episodes of our show,"" Handmaid's star & EP Elisabeth Moss exclusively tells Billboard.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	Sorry, the old “Look What You Made Me Do” can't come to the phone right now. Why? ‘Cause the song has been fully updated and re-recorded ahead of Taylor Swift‘s upcoming Reputation (Taylor's Version), and it was featured almost in full in the latest episode of Hulu's The Handmaid's Tale.


	The song comes at the very beginning of the new episode, which opens with the handmaids staging an uprising led by June Osborne (Elisabeth Moss) against the Commanders. Soundtracked by the revamped version of the pop star's Reputation lead single — featuring re-creations of Jack Antonoff's original synths and thrumming drum beat, plus a new vocal take from an older, more experienced Swift — the women of the show remain stoic as they walk in formation, with June at one point barely escaping into the back of a truck as explosions go off behind her.

	











	Emmy-winning Handmaid's star and executive producer Elisabeth Moss tells Billboard in an exclusive statement that this musical moment has been a long time coming.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I've been wanting to use a Taylor song for many years on the show and we finally found the perfect spot for a track from her, and I'm so glad we waited because there could not be a more perfect song for a more perfect moment,” says Moss, who attended a Toronto stop of The Eras Tour alongside her Handmaid's co-star Bradley Whitford last year. “Taylor has been such an inspiration to me personally. As a Swiftie myself, and I think I can speak for [co-star] Yvonne [Strahovski] and our entire cast as well, who are all Swifties, it's such an honor to be able to use her music in the final episodes of our show.

A post shared by Amy Landecker (@amylandecker)


	“I said to my editor, Wendy, ‘I really want to find a place for a Taylor track in the last 2 episodes of the show' and we wanted to find a music queue for the opening of 9, and all the credit goes to Wendy for picking this track for this moment!”


	Emmy-winning Handmaid's Tale editor Wendy Hallam Martin said sometimes music synchs are just “meant to be,” as they agree this one was.


	“In trying many songs for this specific moment in our series and knowing how much Lizzie wanted a strong female voice and message, Taylor was really the artist that delivered both lyrically and tonally,” Hallam Martin tells Billboard in an exclusive statement. “Our badass main character June in this scene, really was saying ‘look what you made me do' and the song couldn't have been more on point. A perfect pairing. When I laid the song up against the scene, it just landed perfectly thematically, rhythmically and magically hit all the edit points which sometimes happens if it's meant to be. I shared it with Lizzie and we both knew immediately that this was the one!”

	











	Watch the opening scene of season 6, episode 9 of The Handmaid's Tale — and listen for the new version of “Look What You Made Me Do” — below.


	The feature marks one of the first tastes of Reputation (Taylor's Version) that Swifties have gotten — and it's a big one at that. The entire sequence includes the full first and second verses of “Look What You Made Me Do,” plus two choruses.


	Released in 2017, “Look What You Made Me Do” was the starting point for Swift's edgy Reputation era. The track spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, while the album topped the Billboard 200 for four weeks.


	Along with the 14-time Grammy winner's self-titled 2007 debut album, Reputation is just one of two LPs Swift has yet to re-record as part of her ongoing mission to reclaim the rights to her first six albums' masters. So far, all four of the re-recordings she has completed — Fearless (Taylor's Version), Red (Taylor's Version), Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version) — have debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. 


	This October will mark two years since Swift last dropped a Taylor's Version album, with the 1989 re-record, leaving fans antsy for the next one in the sequence. As far as Reputation (Taylor's Version) is concerned, the musician has only given out a few breadcrumbs so far; in March 2024, she shared a brief snippet of the revamped “Look What You Made Me Do” in an episode of Apple TV+'s The Dynasty: New England Patriots, just a few months after the track was featured in a teaser for Prime Video's Wilderness. In August 2023, she also contributed “Delicate (Taylor's Version)” to Prime Video's The Summer I Turned Pretty.

	











	Thanks to a string of possible clues on the pop star's website and social media accounts, however, a lot of Swifties are convinced that she's going to announce something — possibly a release date for Reputation (Taylor's Version) — at the American Music Awards on Memorial Day (May 26).

	Instead of featuring career-spanning songs, the clip highlights 14 onstage wipeouts from frontman Axl Rose. Set to their 1987 classic “Welcome to the Jungle,” the video includes archival footage of Rose slipping, tripping and toppling over onstage across the decades, concluding with a clip from Saturday's (May 17) show in Mumbai, India, where the rocker stumbled on the stairs while performing “Sweet Child O' Mine.”

The stadium run will continue across Asia, the Middle East and Europe through the end of July, with support from Public Enemy, Rival Sons and Sex Pistols members on select dates.

	The band's current lineup includes Rose, Slash, Duff McKagan, Dizzy Reed, Richard Fortus and Melissa Reese. This marks the first tour since longtime drummer Frank Ferrer announced his departure from the group in March. His final show was Nov. 5, 2023, in Mexico. 


	The group has since welcomed Isaac Carpenter as their new drummer for the 2025 tour.


	Guns N' Roses continue to be one of the most enduring acts in rock. Their 1987 debut album, Appetite for Destruction, remains one of the best-selling rock albums of all time. The band's iconic single “Sweet Child O' Mine” became their first Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 when it topped the chart dated Sept. 10, 1988.


	Their Not in This Lifetime… reunion tour in 2019 grossed over $584 million, making it the third-highest-grossing tour of all time. The shows reunited Guns N' Roses members Axl Rose, Slash and Duff McKagan, who, before reconvening in 2016, hadn't played a show together since 1993.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Having just finished shooting his untitled Tom Cruise movie in London, Alejandro González Iñárritu is here on the Croissette for the 25th anniversary of the pic that lit the wick on his career, Amores Perros. 


	Broken out in three separate stories, the gritty, violent movie follows an amateur dog fighter, a supermodel, and a derelict assassin, who are all separately struggling to find love, and discover their lives metamorphosized by a devastating car wreck in Mexico City. The movie, together with Alfonso Cuarón's 2001 young male sex odyssey Y Tu Mama Tambien and Guillermo del Toro's genre fantasia 2006 Pan's Labyrinth were bullhorns when it came to putting Mexican cinema on the global map. 

	











	“When I shot Amores Perros, I shot one million feet of celluloid. When I edited my film, it was 2 hours and 45 minutes, and that was 16,500 feet. Nine-hundred eighty-five thousand feet was left,” Iñárritu tells Deadline today.  That footage has been stored “like wine” in National University of Mexico per the 4x Oscar winner and in celebration of the movie's anniversary, a global immersive visual experience is being mounted with those clips in Milan at Fondazione Prada (Sept 18-Feb 26, 2026) and in Mexico City at LagoAlgo (Oct. 5-Jan. 3, 2026). There's also plans for an LA showcase as well. In addition, MACK books is releasing a book about the making of Amores Perros. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Iñárritu will return to London soon to edit the Cruise feature, temporarily titled Judy. Here's what he had to say about that Warner Bros theatrical release, due out on Oct. 2, 2026, as well as Amores Perros which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best International Film.


DEADLINE: Take us back to Amores Perros here at Cannes Critics Week 25 years ago. What was it like to make your big splash here? Your peers were already on their way in Hollywood: Guillermo del Toro had done Mimic in 1997, and Alfonso Cuarón made The Little Princess in 1995 and Great Expectations in 1998. 


ALEJANDRO G. IÑÁRRITU: In that time, in Mexico, there were only seven films produced a year. In 30 years, nobody had a film in the Cannes Film Festival beside one time Arturo Ripstein. Beside that we were invisible in international cinema. There was no national market for Mexican cinema. It was a horrible period, mostly all the films were subsidized by the government. You had to become a union member to become a cinematographer. It was a miracle (to get this film off the ground). At the time there was a company Altavista that decided to do a private finance company. It was a long script. I was doing a lot of advertising and radio, and they knew my work. They granted us $2 million. In Mexico, there was no career as a filmmaker. You did one film, and you were thankful that you had one chance. That chance, you had to put everything you thought, everything desire. That's why the movie is minimalistic and a guacamole of thick ideas of contradictions and this is about a tropological experiment that is our city, Mexico City. We poured all our hearts. I didn't have any expectations, and I did everything I could. We were young. The film came, I edited it in my home, and sent it to committee of Cannes to the Latin American guy who selected. He said, ‘No, this is very long, very violent' Can the committee see it? ‘No!' We were rejected by the guy who selects films for Latin America who presents to the guy who selects film. ‘Can they see it?' we asked. ‘No!' There was no Mexican distributor, there was no market. In that time, every single festival, Latin American Cinema was ghettoized, confined to the world cinema section of festivals.

	











	Then, José Maria Arriva, who was director of semeana critica, he saw the film, and sent us a love letter. He was the one who said ‘Come' and my mom said ‘you go to the parties that you're invited only.' And suddenly we presented the film. 


	At that time, Bernardo Bertolucci was the President of Critics Week. He invited us to have a lunch with the six other directors that we were competing. I present the film. Half of the screen went out in the middle. I smoked a pack of cigarettes. I arrive to Bertolucci full of nicotine to the lunch. He asked ‘How'd it go?' I said ‘Terrible, it's unbearable to present your film to the world's audience.' I was really shaken. I said, ‘This is the end. This is my first film; that's it. I told him ‘I envy you. That you are Bernardo Bertolucci and you shouldn't have that fear anymore.' He said, ‘Alejandro,' drinking his martini, elegantly dressed, he said ‘I have bad news for you. After the first film, everything gets worse.' In that time in 2000, they were doing a presentation in Cannes Classics of 1900, and as a young man, I couldn't understand of seeing your film 25 years later. And now I'm here 25 years later. Bernardo was right, every film gets worse. The reality is then the film became a huge thing and became incredibly successful around the time, and it became the talk of the town of why it wasn't in competition. Then, I think Guillermo, Alfonso and I — suddenly the Mexican cinema became part of the global conversation. 


DEADLINE: Looking back at the movie and what it's about — could you make it again? Do you still see Mexico through the same lens? 


AGI: Yes, even Mexico hasn't changed for the best. The violence at time in Mexico was super tough. We were assaulted when scouting with guns. We were scouting the dog fights house and I'm talking on the telephone, and there was a gun to my head, and my production designer was down on the ground with a gun to his head. They took our cameras. It was a gang. It was a crack neighborhood. At the end, we said ‘please don't do damage to anybody.' We were saved, but Ioved that scouting, because the scouting was perfect.  The line producer negotiated with the gang, and the exchange was that they would be appear in the film. Everybody who is in the background of the dog seats are the gangmembers. At this time, Mexico has become more difficult. 


DEADLINE: Was there an immediate buying frenzy or Lionsgate took it off the table?


AGI: I think they took it off the table. At the time, foreign language film, they've always been difficult. Altavista was handling that. The film broke records of attendance in Mexico. It was an interesting zeitgeist for at the time, the ruling political party in power for 70 years changed.


DEADLINE: Talk about how Hollywood called you up after the success of Amores Perros here.


AGI: I got an agent that was John Lesher, they were offering me big franchise films. I was already developing 21 Grams. Sean Penn was the one who called me. I met him at a party. He said, if you have something, let me know. I thought it was good for me to explore a film of religious fanaticism, and faith, and everything exploding the South of United States. 21 Grams became the first Focus Features produced film under James Schamus. It was my first American film, independently with final cut. 


Babel was Paramount and Brad Grey at that time. It was a third kind of exploration of connectiveness and non-linear structure. It was an ambitious films shot in various parts of the world. It cost us $25 million – nothing. It was difficult and beautiful and independently done by Paramount. That was a great time in cinema when the studios were supporting independent movies. 

	











DEADLINE: Can you tell us anything about Tom Cruise's stunts in your new film? Even on The Mummy there was a stunt 


AGI: The only thing I will tell you, and don't tell anybody, is that it's nothing of that. I'm so excited. It was an incredible experience with Tom, Sandra Huller, Jesse Plemmons, with Riz Ahmed, but it's a character driven film mounted on the shoulders of Tom which I knew he was exactly the right person. 


DEADLINE: Is it about what's been floating out there — that he's the most powerful global figure trying to convince everyone he's its savior?


AGI: No, the thing that I can tell you. This is a wild comedy of catastrophic proportions. It's insane. He makes me laugh every day. The range that I discovered working with Tom is unprecedented for me as a director. I was so fucking impressed and happy.  


DEADLINE: I have to imagine his tolerance for anything action assails DiCaprio's.


AGI: He gives himself. He has an incredible sense of passion. It's a brutal comedy. It's a wild comedy of human nature. It's scary and funny. It's beautiful. I will start editing next week. 


DEADLINE: With Revenant it was known that it was you versus the environment. But shooting in Pinewood in London, I would imagine, you're in a controlled situation. 


AGI: It was a very challenging film, you will see. It's many borders of many things. Every film challenges me. I don't like doing things that I've done already. This is something that we've never done and it's exciting as well. 


DEADLINE: Filmmakers, the industry love to knock streaming. But if it wasn't for Netflix, you wouldn't have been able to do your last film, Bardo. 


AGI: Absolutely. I didn't have any choice. Nobody wants to bet on a Spanish-language movie about immigrants. It broke every expectation of what a Mexican could talk about. It wasn't about cartels, or gangsters, or drug dealers. It was something that was very personal and unique. It has to do with a particular identity which is me and many other immigrants with some kind of nature of mine.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE:  SP Media Group, a production and entertainment company led by veteran producer and Special Advisor to Hollywood Ambassador Jon Voight, has acquired Avenue Six Studios, a production facility in Van Nuys, CA. Deadline first told you this was in the works earlier this month and part of SP Media's plans to boost local Hollywood shoots following their U.S. film and TV production incentive proposal to the President Donald Trump White House. 


	Founded by Paul Reitzen in 2009, the studio features four fully equipped sound stages, a backlot modeled after a New York City street, and has produced numerous films, commercials, and television shows, including talk shows for Oprah Winfrey and Marie Osmond.

	“We're committed to making films in Hollywood and making Avenue Six Studios the most producer-friendly studio for filmmakers from around the world,” Paul tells Deadline. “I currently have three productions slated for the studio this year and look forward to welcoming more projects to take advantage of its production capabilities.”

	“Avenue Six is a versatile production studio perfectly suited to accommodate an array of creative visions,” said Scott Karol, President of SP Media Group/Atlas Comics. “The studios will be used primarily for film and television production, while its smaller sound stages will be used for branded content, music videos, photography, social media campaigns, podcasts, workshops, and industry events.”


	Future developments to the facility will include the integration of an LED virtual production stage to create immersive visual environments in real time, and a post-production facility, including editing suites and audio facilities, to offer a full-service, end-to-end production environment. This acquisition follows the successful relaunch of Atlas Comics, which under Paul's leadership is developing a slate of film and TV properties, led by the upcoming live-action feature Devilina in partnership with Paramount Pictures.


	“Avenue Six has always stood apart as a certified stage, saving clients time and money by eliminating permit requirements,” said Reitzin, founder of Avenue Six Studios. “With access to props, sets, lighting, equipment and our New York-style backlot, we've proudly served as a one-stop shop for nearly a decade.”

	











	Paul, together with Voight, recently submitted a plan to Trump on how to increase U.S.-based film and television production. The plan, currently under review at the White House, includes federal tax incentives, co-production treaties, job training, and infrastructure subsidies. Paul has recently collaborated with Voight on several movies, including Man with No Past, High Ground, and The Last Gunfight, and has several new titles now in development or production.


	Said Paul, “I've been filming in Los Angeles since I was 12 years old, when I first played a lead in Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s, Happy Birthday, Wanda June for Columbia Pictures, and I'm thrilled at what's possible now that we have our own studio.”


	Recently, Hollywood union leaders and reps of major studios team with Voight in a letter to Trump calling for expanded film and TV production incentives. Left unmentioned in the note was Trump's proposal for 100% tariffs on films produced in other countries.

					By Zac Ntim 

International Reporter


	“The last time I was in this room, I was apologizing for the f*ck-up,” filmmaker Spike Lee joked this morning as he walked into the press conference room in Cannes. 


	The legendary New York filmmaker was referring to 2021, when he served as the Cannes jury president and prematurely announced Titane as the Palme d'Or winner during the closing-night ceremony. 


	Lee is back here in Cannes with his latest feature, Highest 2 Lowest, a modern “reinterpretation” of Akira Kurosawa's 1963 classic High and Low, which was itself based on the novel King's Ransom by Ed McBain. While the original follows a shoe company exec who becomes a victim of extortion when his chauffeur's son is kidnapped by mistake and held for ransom, the new film, set in contemporary New York City, sees a music mogul played by Denzel Washington contend with a similar plot.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	From Apple and A24, the film reunites Lee and Washington for the first time since Inside Man back in 2006. The duo has worked together five times, their credits are including Mo' Better Blues, Malcolm X, and He Got Game.

	“Denzel and I didn't know that our previous film, Inside Man, was 18 years ago. We were surprised because it felt like yesterday. But we didn't miss a step,” Lee said of working with Washington, who received an honorary Palme d'Or before last night's premiere screening of Highest 2 Lowest.

	“I think this is it — five,” Lee added of his collaboration with Washington. “He's been talking about retirement, even though he's just done another deal. Five films together, they stand up.”

	This is Lee's sixth time in the Cannes Official Selection, and Monday's premiere marked 36 years to the day since his first appearance with Do the Right Thing. During the presser, Lee was asked about the critical response to that film back in 1989, particularly around critics who said it would cause riots. 

Watch Denzel Washington's speech below #Cannes2025 pic.twitter.com/z20gasMcau


	“I've had a great experience with this festival, and the people who had their various opinions about Do The Right Thing had nothing to do with the festival. It was just the press,” Lee said.

	“They said Do the Right Thing would cause riots and Black people would lose their minds,” he added. “They were telling people to hope to God this film didn't open in their neighborhood. It was pure blatant racism to suggest Black people couldn't make the distinction between what's on the screen. They all misread it, and none of them admitted that they f*cked up.” 


Highest 2 Lowest was shot across New York, with elaborate action scenes in the Bronx, set against the backdrop of Yankee Stadium. During the presser, Lee was asked about shooting in New York and how he thinks the recent drop in production in the city could be resolved.


	“People are hurting, people whose lives are dependent on working in the film industry,” he said. “The guy [Donald Trump] just said he wants to put a tariff on films made outside the United States. I don't know how that's gonna work. But I don't have the answer for that.” 


	The filmmaker said he simply feels lucky to have been able to shoot several films in New York, adding that he often has pushed back on attempts to make him shoot his New York-based films outside the city.

	“For Do the Right Thing, they wanted us to shoot that film in Baltimore,” Lee said. “Get the f*ck outta here. We were never doing that.” 


	Slated to hit select theaters August 22 before arriving on Apple TV+ on September 5, Highest 2 Lowest is written by Alan Fox and Lee. Todd Black produced for Escape Artists, alongside Jason Michael Berman for Mandalay Pictures. Exec producers included Lee for 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks, and Mandalay's Peter Guber, as well as Juniper Productions' Matthew Lindner, Chris Brigham, and Katia Washington. Mandalay's Jordan Moldo served as co-producer.

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


ITV has just finished briefing staff on a major overhaul of its daytime schedule, which will dramatically scale back the airtime devoted to shows like Loose Women and Lorraine.


	ITV will make more than 220 redundancies under the sweeping changes, but it has promised to reinvest all savings into more streaming-friendly content, including drama and sport.


	That 220 figure represents around half the 450 employees who produce output across ITV Studios-made Good Morning Britain, Lorraine, This Morning, and Loose Women.

					ITV Says Studios Arm Will Grow ""Faster Than The Global Content Market"" This Year Amid Sale Speculation & Q1 Results		
			








	Major broadcast networks are re-evaluating their schedules as viewers watch more content online. Topical daytime shows are expensive to make and do not have the online shelf-life of big-ticket dramas and documentaries, meaning they are being scaled back as media companies switch strategy.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Under the plans, ITV will scale back Loose Women and Lorraine by at least 42%, meaning they will go from broadcasting 52 weeks of the year to 30 weeks. Furthermore, Lorraine's run time will be halved to 30 minutes. The changes will come into force in January 2026.


	ITV is planning to move Good Morning Britain to ITN, which produces ITV News. GMB will be made by a dedicated team at ITV News and will be extended by 30 minutes during the weeks Lorraine is not on air. The hope is that this will reduce overlap between the two services and improve newsgathering. 


	ITV Studios will continue to produce Lorraine, This Morning, and Loose Women, but they will be housed under one combined team, rather than having three dedicated production operations. The shows will also relocate from Television Centre, White City, to a central London location.


	Kevin Lygo, managing director of ITV's Media and Entertainment Division, said: “Daytime has been a core element of ITV's schedule for over 40 years and these changes will set ITV up to continue to bring viewers award winning news, views and discussion as we enter our eighth decade.”


	On the job cuts, he added: “I recognise that our plans will have an impact on staff off screen in our daytime production teams, and we will work with ITV Studios and ITN as they manage these changes to produce the shows differently from next year, and support them through this transition.”

Season 23 of “American Idol“‘ ended on the ultimate high note for Jamal Roberts, who took home the crown for this year. After his win, Roberts posted an emotional victory statement on Instagram, highlighting his journey and those who supported him along the way.

A post shared by Jamal Roberts (@officialjamalroberts)

The Mississippi native dazzled fans and the judges with memorable performances all season, and he overcame some very tough competition from his runner-ups, John Foster and Breanna Nix. Fans flooded the post's comments section with congratulatory statements and praise for the singer that broke records and made “Idol” history.

A post shared by Jamal Roberts (@officialjamalroberts)

 In his post-finale victory statement, the newest “American Idol” winner penned a heartfelt message to his children. “Most of all, I hope my girls see this and know that with faith, hard work, and heart, anything is possible.” 

Roberts is a father of three, including a newborn daughter who was born in early May. The girls have been an integral part of their father's journey and story, such as when the two oldest, Lyrik and Harmoni, appeared on stage alongside him on April 27th. Furthermore, he shared a photo of his youngest, Gianna, just a few days before the Season 23 finale. 

A post shared by Jamal Roberts (@officialjamalroberts)

Roberts was understandably in disbelief over his win. As he wrote in his victory statement: “I never dreamed a kid from my hometown would one day be called ‘American Idol.'” He also highlighted his supporters from his local community, thanking “every person who ever believed in me” and labeling his victory a win for all those who are working toward a dream. 

However, Roberts' win isn't just life-changing for him; it's also an exciting piece of ‘Idol' history. The singer is the first African American man to win the singing competition since Ruben Studdard, who claimed the top prize back in 2003. He also won with a staggering number of votes, receiving 26 million in total. As People shared, host Ryan Seacrest called Roberts' win the “biggest finale vote in show history.”

Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have spent much of the NFL offseason together, and now, Kelce may have casually confirmed what fans have suspected for months: they're living together. During the May 14 episode of his “New Heights” podcast, Kelce slipped a telling detail that immediately sent the internet into overdrive.

“We've got chimneys and we've got furniture,” Kelce said with a grin, using “we” in a way that Swifties instantly clocked as a soft confirmation of their shared home life.

A post shared by New Heights (@newheightshow)

While Travis Kelce didn't outright say he and Taylor Swift live together, his choice of words during the “New Heights” podcast was enough. “We've got chimneys and we've got furniture,” he said while discussing home upgrades, emphasizing “we.”

The comment follows a string of insider reports suggesting the couple has been living together on and off since late 2023. According to the Daily Mail, Swift reportedly spent the holidays at Kelce's $6 million Kansas City estate. Since then, sources say the couple has split their time between Swift's homes and Kelce's during the pop star's “gap year” from touring.

“They get their own workouts in together just as other young couples in love do,” one source told Daily Mail. “She finds him the most romantic man she has ever been with, and he is all about making her comfortable.”

Reportedly, Swift starts her day with yogurt, eggs, and a latte—while Kelce, ever the supportive partner, gives her massages and is careful not to use “even half of his strength.” For a couple often under public scrutiny, they seem to be enjoying a very normal, domestic rhythm.

A post shared by Starcade Media (@starcademediakc)

Kelce also made headlines for a playful moment at teammate Patrick Mahomes' “15 and the Mahomies” charity gala in Las Vegas. Though Taylor Swift did not attend, she still contributed—donating a signed guitar for the event's auction.

A fan-captured video shows Kelce standing by his table, paddle in hand, watching as bids climbed on Swift's autographed item. As the moment heated up, Kelce cheekily backed out and said, “I just realized I have that already.”

Whether he was referring to the actual guitar or another personalized Swift item remains unclear, but the room—including Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes—burst into laughter. Many fans speculated Kelce may have been trying to drive up the bidding before pulling back, adding yet another layer of charm to the viral moment.

The clip quickly spread across social media, earning more than 10,000 likes on X (formerly Twitter). One comment captured the mood perfectly: “Aww, his comment is soooo cute!”

Tell us! Do you think Travis Kelce was referring to Taylor Swift when he said, “we”? Let us know in the comments below.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Kelly Clarkson Exit Rumors Stir Strong Reaction from Talk Show Staff","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/kelly-clarkson-staff-exit-rumors/","Tue, 20 May 2025 04:12:06 GMT","

As speculation continues to swirl around Kelly Clarkson's future with her daytime talk show, behind-the-scenes sources are reporting growing tension and emotional responses from longtime staff and crew members. For months, Clarkson has hinted at a possible shift for “The Kelly Clarkson Show.” Though she hasn't confirmed whether she plans to stay or leave, several are concerned about the outcome.

The 43-year-old singer sparked concern among fans last month after missing several episodes. Most notable was when Andy Cohen stepped in as a guest host. While Clarkson didn't publicly explain her absence, a source claimed she wanted to take time off to focus on her children, River and Remington. She reportedly also wanted to slow down her busy schedule after working nonstop for a while. Over the years, several celebrities, including Josh Groban, Willie Geist, Molly Sims, Wanda Sykes, and Roy Wood Jr., have filled in during her time away.

Now that her contract is set to expire in 2026, speculation about her next move has intensified. This especially after her May 9 concert in Atlantic City, where she addressed the crowd about the situation. Clarkson acknowledged the difficulty of balancing touring with her talk show duties.

“We haven't done a show in a while, y'all, 'cause I have a talk show. It's like a whole other job,” she told the audience. “We are bummed 'cause we love doing shows, and it's hard to fit it in, so it's cool when it does work out with the schedule and it's cool to get to see your faces and feed off y'all.”

While fans have expressed concern over the uncertainty, sources say staff members are feeling increasingly unsettled. This is due to the lack of clarity of the situation. According to a report from the Daily Mail, some team members feel betrayed, especially those who relocated from Los Angeles to New York City when the show moved production.

“Kelly Clarkson is ungrateful, and she fails to recognize how her staff uprooted their lives in Los Angeles and left their homes to relocate to New York because they believed in her and they loved working for her,” one insider claimed. The source added that several employees feel “disrespected” and “abandoned” due to the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Emmy-winning show's future.

A post shared by The Kelly Clarkson Show (@kellyclarksonshow)

According to The New York Post, an NBC insider revealed that Hoda Kotb, who was co-host of “Today”, is among the network's list of potential replacements should Clarkson decide to exit. “There's a long list of names and Hoda is part of that list,” the source stated. “NBC never wanted Hoda to leave. The question is: would Hoda want to do it?”

Despite the internal tension and growing speculation, Clarkson has yet to confirm or deny any plans to leave the show. For now, both her team and her fanbase remain in limbo. Several are hoping the beloved host will choose to extend her tenure. In the meantime, the “American Idol” alum remains busy, preparing to release her ninth studio album this June under her own label. She's also gearing up for a Las Vegas residency running July 4 through August 16, with additional shows scheduled from November 7 to 15.

The five finalists of “The Voice” season 27 performed for the last time before they discovered who was crowned as the winner by voters.

During the two-hour finale, Renzo from Team John Legend, Lucia Flores-Wiseman from Team Adam Levine, Jaelen Johnston from Team Kelsea Ballerini competed for the crown. Jadyn Cree and Adam David from Team Michael Bublé were in the running as well.

The contestants were given two options to wow the crowd, with one ballad and another show-stopping number.

The remaining five gave it their all but only a few songs really wowed. Here are the best performances from ‘The Voice' season 27 finale.

A post shared by NBC's The Voice (@nbcthevoice)

Renzo started off the night with Lenny Kravitz's “Fly Away,” which got him rave reviews. “AMAZING!!!! Renzo is a superstar in the making,” a viewer said. 

Another shared, “Renzo has been bringing it since the very beginning and absolutely deserves our vote! Let's go!”

One fan wrote, “I said last week he reminds me of Lenny! This was great!”

A post shared by NBC's The Voice (@nbcthevoice)

Lucia Fores-Wiseman sang her husky rendition of Pink Floyd's “Wish You Were Here” with a country twist but still kept true to the classic rock aesthetic. 

“Taking one of my favorite songs and making it her own, she's just so unique,” a fan wrote on Instagram. 

Another wrote, “She's like a rare gem, love her voice, so tasteful, pure artistry.”

A post shared by NBC's The Voice (@nbcthevoice)

Adam David chose this simple yet layered song, “You Are So Beautiful” by Joe Cocker and honored it by not deviating too much from the original.

However, he made it his own by adding his own voice and spin to the classic rock hit. “Best performance of the night. Get him the win. Good underdog story,” a fan shared.

Another wrote, “The best of the best! So beyond talented and pure heart! He deserves this so much!!”

A post shared by NBC's The Voice (@nbcthevoice)

Adam David's second song of the night, “Hard Fought Hallelujah” by Brandon Lake and Jelly Roll brought the house down.

“Adam David is absolutely fabulous! I love his voice and soulfulness!” a fan exclaimed. 

“amazing Adam!!! You deserve the win!!” another fan wrote.

One fan predicted, “Your music is in places you never even been to yet. Get your suitcase ready.”

Lucia Flores-Wiseman is a contestant for Team Levine on “The Voice” Season 27, and she has won over audiences with her beautiful voice and charm. She is a fantastic performer, but there is more to her than the person onstage, including information about her family life. Here are five fast facts about her family you need to know.

A post shared by Lucia Flores-Wiseman (@luciafloreswiseman)

In an interview with Deepest Dream in May 2025, Flores-Wiseman discussed her music, including her songwriting process for “Transitions.” She explained the track and briefly mentioned how her parents were helping her and her boyfriend.

“One of the reasons why I wrote ‘Transitions' was because I was moving in with my boyfriend into our house and we're renting from my parents, which I'm super glad because there's no way we can afford a prices now,” she told Deepest Dreams. “I've been with my boyfriend since I was 16 years old, and making that transition (was like) – we're doing this!”

A post shared by Lucia Flores-Wiseman (@luciafloreswiseman)

Flores-Wiseman is white and Hispanic, and her NBC bio revealed more about her experience growing up and struggling to find her place. Her dad is from Mexico, and her mom is from the United States.

“Lucia struggled to connect with her Mexican roots as she was raised away from that side of her family,” the bio reads. “Determined to embrace her lineage, she became fluent in Spanish while studying abroad in Spain.”

A post shared by Lucia Flores-Wiseman (@luciafloreswiseman)

Flores-Wiseman chose a very special song for her Blind Audition and dedicated it to her parents. The song was Ángela Aguilar's “La Llorona.” Her powerful vocals and the emotion in her singing resulted in all four judges turning their chairs around.

A little video to get to know who I am! There's so many things I didn't get to mention, but I hope this shows a little glimpse into my life! Thank you all for the support from my performances on @NBC's The Voice! So excited for playoffs! ❤️  #thevoice #adamlevine #singer #mexicanamerican 

Some families have cats, others prefer dogs, and the Flores-Wiseman family are dog lovers. Lucia shared this information in a video posted on TikTok in April 2025. The post was for fans to get to know her better.

“My dad is from Mexico and my mom is from the U.S,” she said in the TikTok post. She revealed they have a family dog, a black Labrador, who is 14 years old. In the clip, the singer also briefly discussed having addiction in her family and how she wants to be “a cycle breaker.”

A post shared by Lucia Flores-Wiseman (@luciafloreswiseman)

Flores-Wiseman was raised in Washington state, and she loves it. 

“I just love the Pacific Northwest. I love our fresh air, our wonderful community, and I think the music community continues to grow in Seattle,” she told 425 magazine. “I am so grateful to have a community that supports the arts, and if I didn't have that, I'm not sure if I would be where I am today. I don't know if I would be on ‘The Voice' stage if it weren't for so many people believing in me and creating spaces for me to perform.”

It was moving to watch Denzel Washington lope up to the Lumière stage at Cannes and tear up as he accepted his Honorary Palme d'Or from Cannes veteran Spike Lee Monday night at the “Highest 2 Lowest” premiere. It was a surprise to the actor, as he watched a clip reel that ranged from his four prior roles with Lee (“Mo' Better Blues,” “He Got Game,” “Malcolm X,” and “Inside Man”) to “Philadelphia,” “Flight,” “The Book of Eli,” “The Hurricane,” “The Tragedy of Macbeth,” “Fences,” and more.

Festival director Thierry Frémaux knows how to make the most of a Hollywood movie star, who flew into France and out again on his one day off from doing eight sold-out shows a week as Shakespeare's “Othello” on Broadway. If the man looked weary, it's understandable. At 70, he's at the peak of his powers, and if the Oscar gods are smiling, he'll land his third Oscar (after “Training Day” and “Glory”) for his bravura performance as a record mogul struggling with legacy, morality, and family in “Highest 2 Lowest” (A24/Apple TV+), Lee's assured reimagining of Akira Kurosawa's 1963 classic “High and Low.”

Lee is in top form directing one of the most entertaining movies at Cannes; the director makes the most of the glossy New York settings and a heart-stopping subway ride to the Bronx, cut against an Eddie Palmieri concert at Yankee Stadium. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique and editor Barry Alexander Brown could be in the Oscar race along with Washington, Lee, and supporting actor Jeffrey Wright; the movie opens wide August 22 and plays for two weeks before hitting Apple TV+. Rapper A$AP Rocky, onscreen elsewhere in A24's “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You” this year, also gets a great scene in the last third of the film as a musician in fraught pursuit of Washington's character.

The 2025 Cannes Film Festival has so far brought a panoply of movies for critics, audiences, and potential buyers to check out. Lately, Cannes has launched a number of Oscar contenders, especially from Neon, after a series of Palme d'Or winners: “Parasite,” “Titane,” “Triangle of Sadness,” “Anatomy of a Fall,” and “Anora.” That film became the second Neon title to win both the Palme and the Best Picture Oscar after “Parasite.” But last year also launched Oscar-winners “Flow” and Netflix's “Emilia Pérez” out of Cannes.

 










Which movies at Cannes 2025 will wind up in Oscar contention? Neon CEO Tom Quinn, who joined IndieWire's “Screen Talk” podcast live at the American Pavilion on Tuesday (more to come on that), said that the nine-member Cannes jury is a useful sample of some 9,000 Oscar voters, including international actors and directors. Their taste, along with the critics in the constantly updating Screen International jury grid, play a role in distributors' plans. That's why winning Cannes prizes means a lot for a future Oscar campaign.

The highest-profile Oscar contenders at this date also include Lynne Ramsay's “Die My Love,” which MUBI acquired for $23 million. Neon was in the bidding at a reasonable price, said Quinn, who described MUBI's buy as a “press release.” The likeliest Oscar contender is Jennifer Lawrence, who plays a young mother living in an isolated country house with her partner (Robert Pattinson), who falls into a deep post-partum depression and goes quite mad. It will be catnip for the Oscar actors branch. 

Another magnetic turn comes from nonagenarian June Squibb (who was Best Supporting Actress-nominated for Cannes entry “Nebraska” in 2014) in “Eleanor the Great” (Sony Pictures Classics), which was directed by rookie Scarlett Johansson.

 










Of course, a lot depends on what happens at the Cannes awards this coming weekend, as well as which distributor comes through for the likes of actor-turned-director Harris Dickinson's “Urchin,” which boasts a breakout performance from Frank Dillane as an unhoused Londoner.

A number of foreign-language films will wind up submitted by their country of origin, and Cannes awards will help tip the balance toward, say, Germany's critics' favorite “Sound of Falling” from Mascha Schilinski vs. out-of-competition period World War II drama “Amrum,” from director Fatih Akin.

As festival attendees debate the merits of polarizing films such as Julia Ducournau's sci-fi drug drama “Alpha” (Neon), Wes Anderson's too-familiar “The Phoenician Scheme” (Focus), and Ari Aster's modern western “Eddington” (A24), the likelihood of their winding up in the Oscar race seem slim.

There are still many more films to come, as we're only on Day 7 of the festival, so stay tuned for more highlights.

The first time that dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi was imprisoned for his supposed crimes against the regime, he spent most of his time in solitary confinement, blindfolded whenever he was taken out to be interrogated. Deprived of the use of his eyes, Panahi focused all of his attention on his ears — he would obsessively listen for auditory clues around him, and fantasize about his captor's identity based on the sound of his voice.

When Panahi was imprisoned again 12 years later, he was placed in the general population with 300 other prisoners, most of whom had opposed the government in one way or another, but few of whom agreed on the best tactic of doing so. The filmmaker was unnerved — and compelled — by the inevitability of those disagreements becoming even sharper between these people after they were released; some traumatized former detainees would simply try to get on with their lives, while others would be consumed with a rage that bent them toward revenge.

In his first project since the regime ostensibly lifted their restrictions on his art, Panahi draws from those very different prison experiences for a raw and blistering moral thriller about a hard-working Azeri man whose most tormented memories come rushing to the surface when he hears someone walk into his place of business with the same haunting squeak of his former torturer's prosthetic right leg. Played by Vahid Mobasser, a TV station programmer and part-time cab driver, Vahid impulsively abducts the man (Ebrahim Azizi, the only professional actor in this extraordinary cast), drags him into the middle of the desert, and digs a hole big enough to bury his pain alive. 

But — as he begins to suffocate the hostage under a small mountain of dry earth — Vahid is confronted with a stab of doubt. The man, whom we know to be the father of an adorable daughter and the husband of a very pregnant wife, insists that he doesn't have any idea what Vahid is talking about; that he never worked in a prison, and only lost his leg in an accident the previous year. 

Indeed, the scars in the flesh above his missing limb seem as if they're still in the process of healing. And so, however cathartic it might be to simply commit murder and call it vengeance, Vahid feels as though he has no choice but to stuff the man into a wooden crate, load him into his minivan, and drive around Tehran in search of other ex-prisoners who might be able to help verify the captive's identity.

 










So begins a gripping and tightly scripted misadventure that unfolds like something of a cross between Park Chan-wook's “Lady Vengeance” and Panahi's own “Taxi” (with a little “Waiting for Godot” thrown in for good measure), as Vahid's one-man truth and reconciliation commission grows to include a handful of other people whose skin carries the scars of “Peg Leg's” violence. Wedding photographer Shiva (Maryam Afshari, a karate referee in real life) is just starting to get her post-imprisonment career off the ground, but Vahid happens to find her while she's in the middle of shooting bride-to-be Golrokh (stage actress Hadis Pakbaten) who she met while in jail, and feels her own burning desire for justice — even on the day before her nuptials. “It Was Just an Accident” is also the first Panahi feature to show female characters not wearing the mandatory hijab — Shiva among them — here to reflect the rapid changes of Iranian society post-Woman, Life, Freedom movement, where women rebelled against the morality police overseeing their oppression.

Ensconced in her wedding dress, and already in a very emotional state of mind, Golrokh demands to join the fact-finding mission, forcing her hapless groom to come along for the ride (he's played by Panahi's nephew Majid). The increasingly absurd crew is soon completed by the addition of Hamid (carpenter Mohamad Ali Elyasmehr), a splenetic livewire whose fury makes it difficult to trust his conviction that Vahid's prisoner is the same man who terrorized these people when they were prisoners themselves. 

 










From the plot description alone, it's obvious that “It Was Just an Accident” finds Panahi working in a very different register than he had to while “banned” from making films — a period that saw his long-standing penchant for metafiction become considerably more pronounced, as he was forced to make himself the subject of iPhone/camcorder masterpieces like “This Is Not a Film.” This one still had to be shot in secret in order to skirt government approval, but it takes great pleasure in replacing the self-reflexivity of Panahi's illegal work with a slightly more formal sense of composition, even if it remains impossible to separate the final product from the personal experience that informed it.  

The difference is both immediate and also not. On the one hand, the opening scene begins in a car, the most familiar of locations in a filmography that has always shared Abbas Kiarostami's fascination with automobiles as places that are both public and private all at once. The bruised, crisp, and vaguely Lynchian texture of the images, however, is worlds removed from Panahi's usual aesthetic. 

It's late at night, and the man whom Vahid will soon take hostage is driving home with his wife and daughter when he runs over a dog in the road. It was, of course, just an accident, but the little girl in the backseat is furious with her dad all the same. “God simply put it in our path for a reason,” he rationalizes, before examining the animal's carcass in a primordial flood of fluorescent red brake lights (an image that Panahi will recreate later to breathless effect). “God had nothing to do with it,” the child replies.  

 










God's role in the series of events that follows is similarly hard to divine, as it is only because of this fateful accident that the man pulls his car into Vahid's warehouse. But despite its eventual willingness to resolve certain ambiguities, “It Was Just an Accident” derives so much of its throat-clenching power from the uncertainties at the heart of its premise. And not just the uncertainties, but also the overlapping truths — from the irreconcilable queasiness of existing in a country where the traumatized victims of the regime are forced to live as neighbors alongside the people who continue to enable it, with neither faction comfortable identifying themselves as such. 

So much of this film's urgency stems from Vahid's panicked enthusiasm at connecting with other people who share, and can validate, the pain of his experience (he's a stranger to the other characters, his meeting with Shiva facilitated by a mutual acquaintance from jail). But the pain of his experience — most acutely felt in Vahid's kidney — is also enflamed into a new anguish by the group's differing responses to the situation at hand. Some demand blood for blood while parroting the regime's logic that executing an innocent man will guarantee him a spot in heaven. Others insist there's no point, as any man guilty enough to be killed has already dug his own grave.

 










While the hostage spends most of the movie off-camera, his abductors are crammed into frames that contain all of their perspectives without privileging any of them. Uninterested in arguing that one response to a theocratic regime is superior to another (even if the filmmaker's natural empathy insists on the kind of lenience that Hamid doesn't want to hear), Panahi is instead compelled by how tempting it can be for the oppressed to adopt the same methods they suffered at the hands of their oppressor, and by the moral quagmire that results from diving into those waters. As one character sighs, “The deeper you go, the further you sink.” Or, as another character more bluntly offers: “What a heap of shit.” 

But it's the heap of shit that Vahid invites the rest of the film's ensemble to help him shovel, and “It Was Just an Accident” only grows more queasily arresting as the gang is forced to confront the moral ambivalence that burying their hostage at the bottom of it might require. As part of that process, the ex-prisoners are eventually invited to perform a certain kindness for the same man they would like to condemn; the narrative convenience might strain credibility, but that's a small price to pay for the unanswerable questions that it layers into Panahi's film, effectively deepening a self-conflicted parable into something richer and less resolved. 

 










Venom and mercy live side by side in Vahid's heart in much the same way as he and his friends are made to live among the men who so brutally dehumanized them as enemies of the state. Panahi's tense and woundingly distressed new film draws so much of its climactic power from the sense that hell will always follow Vahid like a whistle ringing in his ears, no matter what becomes of the man he's abducted. And even more of it from the implication that heaven must therefore be hiding somewhere close by. 

“It Was Just an Accident” premiered in Competition at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

It's possible that, more than twenty years since its initial release, many movie-goers have forgotten just how high the stakes are in Chris Sanders and Dean DeBois' animated charmer “Lilo & Stitch.” You'd be forgiven for not entirely remembering that the comedy, which follows the antics of its eponymous BFFs (Lilo, a rambunctious five-year-old with a real flair for getting into trouble and Stitch, a rambunctious bright blue alien with a real flair for getting into trouble), is also about a family devastated by personal tragedy, desperately trying to hold on to each other in the face of very tough odds.

 










When said rambunctious bright blue alien crash-lands into the lives of Lilo and her big sister Nani, he adds a touch of whimsy and some nutty adventures into their otherwise complicated lives. Bolstered by cute and cuddly creature design, catchy tunes, and frequent reminders about the importance of ohana (family), the 2002 Disney animated outing is an enduring gem that combines wacky fun with some necessary lessons. It works so well because of its wily combination of packaging and messaging.

But it also works significantly less well when that packaging changes, switched from bright and bubbly animation to a live-action setting that can't help but constantly remind viewers of the supposed reality of the situation. And while much of the charm of the original film remains, in Dean Fleischer Camp's updated “Lilo & Stitch,” it's significantly harder to fully divest ourselves of the pressure of some very earthbound concerns. In short, it's tough to let go and laugh at the antics of a destructive (but cute!) alien being when lingering worry over the need for health insurance hangs over every wacky and wild interaction like the Sword of Damocles. 

Perhaps these are the worries of someone who, too often, would wonder about the clean-up and renovation bills waiting for, say, the McAllister family after the events of “Home Alone.” But so much of what makes the animated “Lilo & Stitch” film stick — so much of what makes any of Disney's best-loved animated classics stick — is that telling of a serious, important story inside an entertaining, family-friendly box. And while animation is not only a medium for kids' movies (let's at least allow that to be laid to rest), it is very often the best medium for these sorts of stories because of the way it can appeal to a kids' eyes and hearts. That's a message that the live-action remake-mad Disney might want to remember.

 










Written by Chris Kekaniokalani Bright and Mike Van Waes, the live-action “Lilo & Stitch” lightly updates Sanders and DeBois' original story, including a few neat character evolutions (like casting original voice actor Amy Hill as Tūtū, a new version of her previous character Mrs. Hasagawa, or turning original Nani voice actor Tia Carrere into social worker Mrs. Kekoa) and the very smart choice to allow intergalactic baddies Dr. Jumba Jookiba (Zach Galifianakis) and Agent Pleakley (a perfectly cast Billy Magnussen) to play both their alien and human versions. But its heart remains the same, both a feature and a bug: this is a story about ohana, and about what it really takes to keep a family together. That's inherently dramatic stuff.

A snappy opening takes us through some essential introductions: Stitch (again voiced by original co-director Sanders) is the product of illegal genetic experimentations from the evil Dr. Jookiba who, it seems, was really into the idea of creating a being both silly and smart, adorable and ugly, and totally hellbent on destruction. As the Grand Councilwoman (voiced by Hannah Waddingham) bemoans during a very bad indeed meeting of the United Galactic Federation, Experiment 626 (as he's known before he hits Earth) is “so naughty.” His punishment for his creation? Exile away from the rest of the civilized federation. 

 










626, in all his infernal naughtiness, escapes the fed's clutches and zips his way straight to Earth, a protected land that's been designated as a space for revitalizing the mosquito population (one of many good jokes). Until this point, much of 2025's “Lilo & Stitch” looks a heck of a lot like the original, with colorful, animal-inspired aliens pottering around a massive ship (we especially love the trigger-happy pink-haired gal, so eager to blow Earth sky high for funsies). And then, we're on Earth, and suddenly reminded this is live-action and ostensibly, if not real, at least rooted in some kind of reality.

Despite living in the relative idyll of Hawaii, Lilo (spirited newbie Maia Kealoha) has lots of problems: her parents have passed away, her older sister Nani (a wonderful Sydney Elizebeth Agudong) is trying to raise Lilo, there's never enough money, there's never enough time, and Lilo is way too plucky and smart to appeal to most other kids her own age. More than anything, Lilo wants a best friend, and it's a credit to the film that her concerns are treated with just as much as gravity as Nani's, which are much more heavy and worrisome (after all, why do you think they need a social worker?). 

When 626 crash-lands on Earth, it's only a matter of time until the infinitely curious Lilo finds him (as in the animated film, their meet-cute takes place at an animal rescue; unlike in the animated film, it's significantly harder to buy that the cute and fluffy and also blue and bipedal alien is even remotely passable as a dog). Hot on his heels? The mismatched Dr. Jookiba (villainous) and Agent Pleakley (hilarious, obsessed with humans and their fashion in particular). Circling all of them? Courtney B. Vance as CIA operative (sort of) Cobra Bubbles. Ever-inescapable? The very real possibility Nani is going to have to give up Lilo. And no, the appearance of an insane alien with an appetite for destruction really does not help matters. 

 










How ever will they get out of these many pickles? Well, by way of some cute adventures, some incredibly upsetting upheavals, and a generous dash of alien-created technology, used frequently enough to really tickle some of those latent “Home Alone” memories. Along the way, everyone — one of the true misses of this version is a credits-set quick dash through the charming and totally unexpected family Lilo and Stitch manage to craft through thick and thin, more attention really should have been paid to this modern ohana — learns some valuable lessons, has some fun, and falls deeper in love with the newly-minted Stitch.

The heart of this story remains firmly intact, but there's something about seeing it rendered in live-action that takes away its inherent magic. It's harder to fall into, much tougher to lose yourself in. Maybe we can never quite recreate the dreaminess of an original story, but there's something to be said for remembering what it feels like to be caught inside that sort of bubble, and not crash-landed back on Earth.

Walt Disney Pictures will release “Lilo & Stitch” in theaters on Friday, May 23.

Spike Lee is calling out a bad call from the Academy more than 30 years later: The auteur, along with most cinephiles, is convinced that Denzel Washington was snubbed for the Best Actor Oscar for “Malcolm X.” Al Pacino instead won over Washington for “Scent of a Woman.” 

During the Cannes press conference for Lee's latest (and allegedly final) collaboration with Washington, “Highest 2 Lowest,” the director compared the Academy's decision to a poor referee call in basketball, something that Lee also knows all too well about given his status as the patron saint of the Knicks. 

 










“‘Malcolm X,' what he did with that film was amazing,” Lee said of Washington, as reported by Variety. “And no disrespect to my brother Al Pacino, I love him. But Denzel, in my opinion, should have won.”

Related Stories ‘A Magnificent Life' Review: Sylvain Chomet's Tribute to Marcel Pagnol Flies by Without Making an Impact ‘Jane Austen Wrecked My Life' Review: This Delightful, If Slight, French Trifle Riffs on Classic Romance 

Lee continued, “With these awards, it's like basketball, where the ref blows a call and you have to make a call. So the call I think was ‘Training Day,' which he won an Oscar for. But we don't do our work for awards, which are nice, but it's the work that is going to stand above all awards.” 

It was a decade later, exactly, that Washington won Best Actor for Antoine Fuqua's “Training Day.” And “Highest 2 Lowest” could propel Washington back into the awards circuit: IndieWire's David Ehrlich deemed Washington's performance “his most towering since ‘Training Day'” in the review. 

As for the legacy of “Malcolm X,” Lee paid tribute to the late civil rights activist, who would have been 100 during the festival. Washington also received a surprise Honorary Palme d'Or during the May 19 premiere of “Highest 2 Lowest,” with Cannes festival heads Thierry Frémaux and Iris Knobloch presenting the award onstage ahead of the screening. Washington had to sit out the press conference for the film, though, as the star had to immediately return to New York to resume leading the Broadway show “Othello.”

When asked if he and Washington plan to collaborate more after their five films together, Lee said, “I think this is it. He's been talking about retirement, so…Even though he just did another deal [for “Here Comes the Flood”].” (To note, Washington has also already confirmed his role in Ryan Coogler's “Black Panther 3”.) 

Lee added, “I thought you said you were retired Denzel, what's up?! But those five films together, those stand up.”

 










Lee reunited with longtime collaborator Washington for his English-language reimagining of Japanese director Akira Kurosawa's 1963 film “High and Low.” The duo previously collaborated on “Inside Man,” “Mo' Better Blues,” “Malcolm X,” and “He Got Game.” “Highest 2 Lowest” will be released August 22 from A24 followed by an Apple TV+ streaming premiere via Apple Original Films in September.

Yet don't count Washington out of another Lee joint entirely: The actor did say earlier this year that he would work with him again. “Spike is consistently Spike, and I love that about him,” Washington said. “And I love working with him, and I'd work with him again. I just like the way his brain works.”

Turnstile are back with the latest new single from Never Enough. “Look Out for Me” comes with another music video directed by singer Brendan Yates and guitarist Pat McCrory, and, this time, it tracks Yates as he speeds around Baltimore in a station wagon, getaway-style, and the rapid-fire load-ins various groups of people make whenever the car pulls up. There's a pretty cinematic slow-motion ending capping off the clip, too. Watch it below.

The music videos for “Never Enough,” “Birds,” “Seein' Stars,” and “Look Out for Me” are all part of an upcoming companion film titled Turnstile: Never Enough. That 50-minute movie, which was directed by Yates and McCrory, includes all 14 songs from the record and will be followed by a conversation with Turnstile when it debuts at Tribeca Festival 2025.

Never Enough follows Turnstile's breakout album, Glow On, and is their first LP with new guitarist Meg Mills, following Brady Ebert's departure in 2022. It's out June 6 via Roadrunner.

Glow On earned Turnstile three nominations at the 2023 Grammy Awards. The next year, they got another nomination, courtesy of the New Heart Designs remix EP, featuring a new version of “Alien Love Call,” made with BadBadNotGood and Blood Orange, at the 2024 Grammy Awards.

Ten years ago, Nicki Minaj ousted a journalist from her hotel room. “Do not speak to me like I'm stupid or beneath you in any way,” she said. The Pinkprint, her 2014 opus, so boldly echoed this command that it felt autocratic: a vengeful monarch punishing the serfs and peasants who dared disrespect her crown. Enter skaiwater, a masochistic yearner whose own pinkPrint EPs trade despotism for delirium. The UK-born crooner grew up on swag-era saviors, the Nickis and Kanyes and Drakes who soundtracked a weightless, optimistic cultural moment. As that optimism has devolved—who doesn't feel manic in America?—the hedonistic highs of last decade have given way to deeper, darker lows. Terror bass tortures speaker systems; dark plugg draws out demons; rage music reigns over angsty teens. When this generation gets a pinkPrint, it's a frenetic fever dream constantly threatening to combust.

skaiwater's eclectic output—a gushy hybrid of Jersey Club, pop-punk, and post–Whole Lotta Red rage—paints a vivid portrait of a heart on fire. Originally released on her alt SoundCloud account in February and April, pinkPrints 1 and 2 are, as ever, frothing with desire. But this desire never feels depressive, which is a testament to how fun, even if fierce, these EPs make apoplectic lust feel. Entirely self-produced and spiritually indebted to the 2010s, their uncleared samples and “Trap-A-Holics!” tags don't only summon the swag era but subvert it, grafting its weightlessness onto rawer, more visceral realities. A longing Rihanna promises to “Kiss It Better”; a lovesick skaiwater would rather their ex kiss their ass. The Tumblr-tinted backdrop reflects not only lost love, but also a lost time.

Production is constantly the difference between progress and pastiche. Take the pulsating “candy,” a shape-shifting squall that turns Mk.gee's “Candy” into a club banger, then turns that into a rage remix of PARTYNEXTDOOR's “Recognize.” A standout of the sparse pinkPrint 1, it thrives on bug-eyed mischief: transforming, then transcending touchstones that seem too sacred to be tinkered with. On “use me,” skaiwater constructs a Rolling Loud–ready trap stomper from the bones of a Sabrina Carpenter song. It's so zany that it's kind of cathartic. Less so is “we didn't get the memo,” which forges a jerk beat from “Moment 4 Life,” only to drag-and-drop Drake's entire verse at the end. It's a rare miss: Most of the time, the samples are so well-placed that they could pass for features. It feels like watching someone play MyTeam with the past 15 years of music.

This effect is perfected on pinkPrint 2, an inventive sequel that doubles its counterpart in size and scope. The swag era once again joins us via sample—Frank Ocean, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj—but skaiwater also remixes melodic peers, wailing her own love songs over the ones in her playlist. A Beabadoobee ballad mutates into a bit-crushed, shit-talking rage thumper (“allah”); PinkPantheress fights for her life over blasts of gut-rearranging low end on a searing club anthem (“cashapp”). It feels like a DJ set hosted by baby-voice Playboi Carti in whichever circle of Hell tdf buys his distortion pedals. And it feels, also, vaguely familiar: We've all thought of a song, kept thinking about it, started wondering what it might sound like with a kick, or a chord change, or the topline of some other song, or a different guest verse. The pinkPrint EPs are no different, which is what makes their delirium so rewarding. Somewhere behind skaiwater the cracked producer, you can always make out skaiwater the fan.

Nearly 10 minutes pass before you hear a single snare drum on Chuckyy's I Live, I Die, I Live Again. The 19-year-old Chicago emcee rose to street-rap prominence last year on the strength of a Lil Durk cosign and his keen appropriation of the diabolical drill beats favored by Philly artists like Skrilla and Ot7Quanny, but his sound was distinct: pared-down choral, Blumhouse-slasher instrumentals that put sharp focus on his deadpan performances. But on the first half of his latest tape, he's backed by little more than reverb-laden chanting and murky bass pulses, building tension for beat drops that never arrive. At its best, I Live, I Die, I Live Again drops all semblances of song structure, allowing verses to breathe and Chuckyy's trains of thought to digress. He knows it's the anticipation, not the jumpscare itself, that makes a horror flick effective. At a time when bite-sized virality reigns supreme, it's refreshing to sit through a slow-burning tape that unfolds at its own patient pace.

I Live's opening stretch is radically sparse, not just in its complete lack of percussion but also in Chuckyy's refusal to repeat himself: Cuts like “2-Double-O Dash” and “FREE SMURK OFNG” play out like radio freestyles recorded live from the Shadow Realm, Hell's bells tolling behind surreal images wrenched from his stream of consciousness. On opener “Wemby,” he matter-of-factly chains drill tropes with a sense of strategy, as if he's priming the pocket for absurd imagery that's still cooking. The gems that do emerge amid the eerie, wordless background vocals are vivid and eccentric. Twenty-dollar bills bloom in his backpack like seaweed. A basketball metaphor that might otherwise read as trite turns hilarious when Chuckyy remembers that Kevin Durant tanked his parlay.

Kicking off the tape with its most unorthodox song is a bold move, but one that pays off. By annihilating expectations about drops and hooks from the jump, Chuckyy is free to build whatever structures he'd like within the newly cleared space. “Hiccup,” with its pizzicato strings and canned brass, reconfigures a first-wave trap palette into a delicate MIDI symphony. By the time the track arrives on I Live it feels less like a radical outlier and more like a logical progression from its predecessors, adding a subtle jolt of energy to the Gothic haze.

After filtering out his less adventurous listeners, Chuckyy stacks the B-side of I Live, I Die, I Live with a suite of more familiar fare. “Hotseat” opens with a verse from fellow Chicago native LUCKI, the tape's sole guest and one of Chuckyy's most recognizable influences. Bolstered by a spectral bit of Three 6 Mafia pastiche (complete with hi-hats, snares, and kicks this time!), the duo sound like they're duking it out to see who can appear more nonchalant. The elder statesman wins out in the end, flashing his technicality without breaking a sweat: LUCKI's use of syncopated snares to divide bars into bite-sized units makes dashed-off lines like “take pink 30s like it's a mint” or “Patek remind me of Dove” feel vivid. Locking in with one of his heroes puts a battery in Chuckyy's back, and although there's a skill gap between them, I'm fond of the way he refers to the color-changing effect of Promethazine on his Fanta as “power of the Tristan,” adding some magical realist flair to the image.

Because Chuckyy's appeal is so tied to his fondness for horror movie ambiance, his brief attempts to break the mold feel awkward and out of place. I Live's biggest hit, “My World,” which is built around a sample of EKKSTACY's viral bedroom pop single “i walk this earth all by myself,” shrinks the epic desolation of earlier tracks into a clumsy, too-cute slice of sample drill. This A24-coded detour is a trite intermission laden with boilerplate “did it on my own” cliches meant to echo its source material, landing like an unwelcome respite from the cosmic, Carpenterian dread that surrounds it.

The closing one-two punch of “Teary Eyed” and “Sympathy,” dressed with depressive string arrangements, creaky keys, and power-ballad guitar riffs, is a much more potent introspective turn, mirroring Friday the 13th's lush coda overlooking the canoe on Crystal Lake. Chuckyy's writing—still concerned with APs and artillery—could use a bit more soul-searching to match the meditative tone here, but “fly to L.A. when I'm overstimulated, this shit rеal,” is such a goofy, self care-centric flex that I'm willing to overlook the superficiality. Style often trumps substance in the world of slashers anyhow, and for a 19-year-old upstart, Chuckyy's got it in spades.

Filtered through the sheen of self-care, Maren Morris' post-divorce life seems perfectly suited to an Instagram carousel on “cut,” a steely synth-pop track off her new album Dreamsicle. She's getting plenty of sleep, going to therapy, hitting yoga four times a week, and being “present with every friend.” You'd never know the heated truth until the song, like its title, cuts behind the scenes. “Honestly? Fuck!” she sings, loosening her voice from its corset, as keyboards fizzle up into the atmosphere and explode like fireworks.

Morris and singer-songwriter Ryan Hurd, who have a son together, finalized their divorce in January 2024. Later that June, she came out as bisexual. After she spent portions of her last album, 2022's Humble Quest, singing about (and co-writing with) Hurd, Dreamsicle could easily have been a sharp-tongued rebuttal to all that pillowy tenderness. But Morris has insisted it isn't a capital-D divorce album littered with shards, like fellow Texan Kacey Musgraves' star-crossed. Instead, it feels closer to Miranda Lambert's self-inquiry following her 2015 split from Blake Shelton. On Dreamsicle, Morris comes across like a guest attending the house party of her new life, snooping through the medicine cabinet—and catching revealing glimpses of herself in the mirror.

Among her discoveries are novel sides to her sexuality. Morris warns a no-strings attachment against developing feelings on the swaying “bed no breakfast,” but the lyrics sound like an awkward Airbnb listing: “A five-star review is expected/I check every box on your checklist,” she sings coyly, backed by breathy, swooning vocals. The more interesting flirtation unfurls with Naomi McPherson (from indie-pop band MUNA) on the '80s-inspired “push me over.” Over hair-metal guitar riffs and staggered R&B rhythms, a fitting frame for Morris' aerodynamic vocals, she details the electric thrill of finally being with a woman. “We can test out my hypothesis,” she demurs.

Morris has consistently eschewed attempts to categorize her music. But where 2019's Girl felt unfocused, Dreamsicle is more cohesive, as though Morris were pulling varied outfits from a single closet. After working with pop powerhouse Jack Antonoff on “Get the Hell Out of Here,” off her 2023 EP The Bridge, she reunites with him for three tracks, including the acrobatic, blues-tinged “people still show up” and the coursing indie-rock closer “holy smoke.” But the complexity of those songs isn't consistent across the album, and when Morris leans into familiar pop tropes, like the moody synths on “because, of course” or the fairy-dust whimsy of the title track, it feels like she's following someone else's style cues, instead of relying on her own instincts.

While Dreamsicle avoids too much navel-gazing about the past, Morris is a quick draw on bouncy opener “lemonade,” co-produced by the Monsters & Strangerz and Isaiah Tejada, taking aim at both her ex and her own habit of trying to sweeten his sour behavior. But she chases the metaphor far past its fencing, landing on the silly jibe, “Gotta pour you down the drain.” The more compelling version of that wounded emotion shines through “this is how a woman leaves,” a country-pop ballad that gives Morris' voice space to expand into a swaggering snarl.

If there's any love to be found in the wreckage of her marriage, it turns out to be with friends. “grand bouquet,” another Antonoff production, wraps a reflective acoustic guitar around Morris' quiet delivery as she gratefully acknowledges her friends' presence in her life. Morris may have once treasured the red roses of romance, but on Dreamsicle, she turns her attention to the wildflowers that surround her—and are only now coming into bloom.

Taylor Swift contributed “Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor's Version),” a re-recorded version of the hit single from her 2017 studio album, Reputation, to an episode of The Handmaid's Tale. The track appeared in the ninth episode of Season 6. Swift has not yet released the song online or on streaming services, nor has she announced the full album Reputation (Taylor's Version). The extensive airing of the track follows a preview on Wilderness back in 2023. Check out the longer cut on X.

“I've been wanting to use a Taylor song for many years on the show and we finally found the perfect spot for a track from her, and I'm so glad we waited because there could not be a more perfect song for a more perfect moment,” Elisabeth Moss, the lead star and executive producer of the series, told Billboard. “Taylor has been such an inspiration to me personally. As a Swiftie myself, and I think I can speak for [co-star] Yvonne [Strahovski] and our entire cast as well, who are all Swifties, it's such an honor to be able to use her music in the final episodes of our show.”

Featuring her singles “Look What You Made Me Do” and “...Ready for It?,” Reputation was Swift's fifth No. 1 album and her final release for Big Machine Records, which had issued all of her previous LPs. It earned Swift just one Grammy nomination, for Best Pop Vocal Album, but she ultimately lost to Ariana Grande and Sweetener. Swift recorded one part of Reputation with producer Jack Antonoff, but she did the bulk of it with Max Martin and Shellback. She also enlisted Future and Ed Sheeran for “End Game.”

So far, Swift has re-released four of her albums: Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version) arrived in 2021, while updates of Speak Now and 1989 were released in 2023. Swift began to re-record her pre-Lover material, in 2019, after Scooter Braun acquired her catalog by purchasing the Big Machine Label Group. In a 2022 interview with NPR, Braun said that he had “regrets” over how the deal panned out.

Between her re-recorded albums, Swift has continued to release new material, issuing her 10th original album, Midnights, in October 2022. Her 11th album, The Tortured Poets Department, followed in April 2024. She recently wrapped up her record-breaking Eras Tour, which spanned the globe and lasted multiple years.

Taylor Swift‘s “Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor's Version)” was unexpectedly featured in the most recent episode of the Hulu series The Handmaid's Tale. The 2017 single, off Swift's LP Reputation, has been rerecorded and revamped, showcasing a new vocal take from the pop singer.


Swift's song appears in the opening scene of the penultimate episode of The Handmaid's Tale, which is coming to an end this season. It soundtracks a group of rebellious handmaids stoically walking in formation. 


	“I've been wanting to use a Taylor song for many years on the show and we finally found the perfect spot for a track from her, and I'm so glad we waited because there could not be a more perfect song for a more perfect moment,” star and executive producer Elisabeth Moss said in a statement to Billboard. “Taylor has been such an inspiration to me personally. As a Swiftie myself, and I think I can speak for [co-star] Yvonne [Strahovski] and our entire cast as well, who are all Swifties, it's such an honor to be able to use her music in the final episodes of our show.” 

	











	Moss added, “I said to my editor, Wendy [Hallam Martin], ‘I really want to find a place for a Taylor track in the last two episodes of the show' and we wanted to find a music queue for the opening of nine, and all the credit goes to Wendy for picking this track for this moment!”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Hallam Martin shared, via Billboard, “In trying many songs for this specific moment in our series and knowing how much Lizzie wanted a strong female voice and message, Taylor was really the artist that delivered both lyrically and tonally. Our badass main character June in this scene, really was saying ‘look what you made me do' and the song couldn't have been more on point. A perfect pairing. When I laid the song up against the scene, it just landed perfectly thematically, rhythmically and magically hit all the edit points which sometimes happens if it's meant to be.”


	“Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor's Version)” first premiered in the teaser trailer for the Amazon Original series, Wilderness.

	Swift has been re-recording her initial six albums in an effort to reclaim her masters. She has previously completed Fearless (Taylor's Version), Red (Taylor's Version), Speak Now (Taylor's Version), and 1989 (Taylor's Version), but has yet to release Reputation (Taylor's Version). Last year, she teased “Look What You Made Me Do” in an episode of Apple TV+'s The Dynasty: New England Patriots, while “Delicate (Taylor's Version)” appeared on The Summer I Turned Pretty.

	











	Fans have been speculating that Swift is gearing up for an announcement at the American Music Awards on May 26. Since it has now been two years since Swift unveiled a recording, she could be planning to offer some news about Reputation (Taylor's Version).

When Jennifer Farber Dulos, a Brooklyn-raised daughter of great wealth and privilege, a member of the Brown Class of 1990 and once a member of the New York's downtown literary elite, vanished after dropping her five kids off at the New Canaan Country School on the morning of May 24, 2019, people in Fairfield County, Connecticut — especially those familiar with the area's thorny divorce court — entered a collective breakdown. The handsome husband and beautiful South American paramour, the failing marriage and business, the anxieties of the suburban sports parent, battles over money and status — the case, which made newspapers around the nation, touched on the fears of every parent. It was like a camera dropped into the subconscious of America's wealthiest towns. At its core, Jennifer's story — presumed dead, her body has never been found — personified every struggling mother's worst nightmare. The language in the first police reports said it perfectly: “Lying in wait.” 












That's what Fotis Dulos, Jennifer's estranged husband, was presumed to have been doing when his wife was idling through the drop off line at school: “lying in wait” for Jennifer, whose demise would be discerned in a handful of clues found in a dumpster fifty miles north — a bloody Vineyard Vine's T-shirt, bloody zip ties, a bloody bra. What follows is a section from my book, Murder in the Dollhouse: the Jennifer Dulos Story, that details the first hours of the investigation, the moves the small town police department made after the panicked calls arrived from Jennifer's friends. Fotis would be charged with her murder and die by suicide while awaiting trial; his girlfriend would later be convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. Jennifer's story remains a fixation not because it's unusual or strange, but because it's so familiar. It illuminates a dark river that flows beneath our everyday lives.


	***


	The New Canaan Police station is in a brick building at 174 South Avenue. There are columns in front and a sign over the door. If the department seems small, with just forty-five officers tasked with protecting more than twenty thousand residents, that's because New Canaan has always been one of the safest towns in Connecticut. It's where New York City police go when they ascend to cop heaven. The citizens are rich, the kids future-oriented, the domestics documented. Now and then, an entire year goes by without a single violent episode.

	The stories of murder in New Canaan are legends because there have been so few of them. In 1969, a ten-year-old named Mary Mount vanished off her New Canaan street, sparking a manhunt unmatched in town until the search for Jennifer Dulos. Mount's body was found in the South Norwalk Reserve shortly after her disappearance. The killing remains unsolved. On December 10, 1970, a New Canaan father returned from his job at Hi-Standard Manufacturing in Hamden, Connecticut, to find four members of his family — wife, daughter, son, and mother — slaughtered in their house at 93 Millport Avenue. The murder weapons included dagger, hatchet, hammer, necktie. A surviving son, seventeen-year-old John Rice, was the only suspect. “The youth, an avid outdoorsman who was to be promoted to Eagle Scout last night, is about 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds,” the Hartford Courant reported. “He has dark brown hair, wears glasses and has a severe case of acne.” Rice turned himself in on December 16, 1970. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity. In 2021, seventy-seven-year-old Albert Kokoth killed his seventy-five-year-old wife. He said he shot her by accident. Though the first shot might have indeed been a mistake, the second, third, and fourth shots probably weren't.


	All to say, when the missing persons call came for Jennifer Dulos, the entire department took notice. The investigation, which would be the most expensive in Connecticut state history, started with a re- quest to Verizon. The police wanted information on Jennifer's phone: When had it last been used? What cell tower had it “pinged”? When you make a call, the signal bounces off the nearest tower and up into space, reaches a satellite, and then rebounds to the phone of the person you dialed. With basic geometry—these three points (tower, satellite, receiver) describe an immense triangle — you can determine the location of any cell phone, present or past.

	According to Verizon, Jennifer's phone last pinged a tower near Waveny Park in New Canaan at 11:09 Friday morning, May 24, 2019.


	Captain Andrew Walsh and Sergeant Kenneth Ventresca of the New Canaan Police Department went to Waveny Park on the night of the disappearance in search of Jennifer's Chevy Suburban. They found it on Lapham Road near the edge of the park at 8:00 p.m. “The tailgate was backed up against this tree,” Sergeant Ventresca reported. “The Suburban was not running; keys were not in the ignition. The gear le- ver was actually stuck in reverse. The doors were locked . . . You could see the cleanup of the blood-like substance all over the passenger side under a flashlight.”

	











	Two different New Canaan cops, Officer Matthew Blank and Sergeant Aaron LaTourette, had gone to Jennifer's house at 69 Welles Lane at around 7:00 p.m. They knocked on the door, heavy service belts creaking. Leaf shadows, night noises. No answer. They phoned the Dulos' nanny, Lauren Almeida, who gave them the garage door code. They typed the numbers by the glow of the pad. The door opened. The search began by flashlight. There was what looked like blood on the floor and what looked like blood splatter on the Range Rover.


	They continued into the house. The record from their police body cam, which was shown at the Stamford courthouse in 2024, resembles footage taken of the interior of a wrecked ship, the ghostly halls and haunted rooms suggesting sudden disaster. There's an Andy Warhol silkscreen of Jackie O. — Jennifer fetishized America's fashionable wives — a picture of the Dulos children, and, on the second floor, closets filled with children's shoes and clothes. A silver C-shaped Mylar balloon — possibly for Jennifer's daughter, Clea-Noelle — is tied to a counter in the kitchen. Straining at its tether, this balloon functioned as a clock — according to a company called Balloon Party Palace, “In optimum environments, mylar (foil) balloons will remain full and taut for 3–5 days” — demonstrating the temporal closeness of zero hour.


	“In addition to blood evidence in the garage, there was evidence that someone had attempted to clean up blood,” the state police detective John Kimball, who helped oversee the investigation, said later. “There were what appeared to be swirl marks on the sides of the vehicles.”


	Officer Thomas Patten, who examined the garage more thoroughly the next day, cataloged additional evidence:


	•   Blood splatter found on the garbage cans


	•   Blood splatter on the driver's side door


	•   Swipes where someone tried to clean up concrete floor


	•   Partial bloody shoe prints


	•   A quarter sized blood drop on the right fender on the range rover


	•   The left front fender had been wiped clean


	At this point, per procedure, the New Canaan police called in the Major Crimes Unit of the Connecticut State Police, which had been created to work on just such cases. From there, it became a joint investigation, with the state cops supplying high-tech gadgets and expertise, and the local cops supplying on-the-ground knowledge of the town.

	











	Within forty-eight hours, the investigators, using cell phone and internet data, had pieced together Jennifer's last known whereabouts.


	Friday, May 24, 2019:


	7:50 a.m.: Jennifer Dulos is seen on neighborhood security cameras driving Chevy Suburban down Welles Lane in New Canaan.


	7:58 a.m.: Jennifer Dulos is seen arriving in Chevy Suburban at New Canaan Country School.


	8:05 a.m.: Jennifer Dulos is seen on surveillance driving toward her house on Welles Lane. 


	10:25 a.m.: Jennifer Dulos' Chevy Suburban is seen leaving Welles Lane.


	10:38 a.m.: Jennifer Dulos' Chevy Suburban is seen on camera near Waveny Park on Lapham Road in New Canaan.


	11:09 a.m.: Jennifer Dulos' phone goes dark.


	“DID YOU EVER HEAR OF something called luminol?” an investigator asked Michelle Troconis later.


	No.


	“Luminol is something we use to look at evidence,” said the cop. “To see if blood was somewhere. When it hits blood, it illuminates.”


	For example, said the cop, we covered the inside of Jennifer's garage on Welles Lane with luminol.


	Handing Michelle a photo of the garage, the cop pointed out illuminated patches, saying, “It's all that.”


	“That's blood?” asked Michelle.


	Yes, said the cop. “And who do you think that [blood] belongs to?” In an interview, Kathryn Pinneri, who in 2022 served as president of the National Medical Examiners Association, told me: “When luminol touches a place blood has been, even if the blood's been cleaned up, it turns fluorescent. If there's been hemoglobin on a surface, the luminol turns blue. You have to turn the lights off to see it. There's an eerie glow. It can also show how much blood has been spilled.


	“It depends on the age and size of the person, but, on average, we have about five liters of blood in our body. Most people can tolerate losing as many as two liters of that blood. If you lose three liters and don't replace it immediately, you're going to die.”                                                     


	According to Connecticut's chief medical examiner, James Gill, who worked the case, the amount of blood seemingly spilled in the garage probably means Jennifer Dulos sustained an injury or injuries that would have been “non-survivable” without medical intervention.

	











	FOTIS SEEMED DETACHED WHEN the police got him on the phone that first night. Maybe it was his Greek accent, or all that Ivy League education, but his demeanor was strangely disengaged. You'd expect a man whose estranged wife had just gone missing to be emotional, confused. But no, nothing. “Mr. Dulos never seemed concerned about his wife,” an officer on the call said later.


	Officer Thomas Patten asked Fotis to come by the New Canaan police station the next day. There was nothing accusatory in this request. It was standard. The police were trying to find Jennifer, and wanted the husband's help. Fotis said he'd be there at around 12:00 p.m., Saturday, May 25.


	Fotis did not arrive until 2:47 p.m. He'd asked his lawyer Jacob Pyetranker to go with him. Like many of Fotis's decisions, this one was halfway smart. “Halfway” because when the police call you into the station a day after your estranged wife has vanished, it's smart to have an attorney, but only “halfway” because Jacob Pyetranker is not a criminal attorney. He's a divorce lawyer, and he seemed beyond his depth from the start. He got in and out of the criminal case fast, but not before watching his client make a critical mistake.


	Fotis arrived before Pyetranker. He should have waited for his attorney in the parking lot, but, because he was an arrogant man who believed he had everything under control, he went into the station by himself. The New Canaan police officer Thomas Patten and the Connecticut State Police officer Christopher Allegro met him in the lobby. Detective Patten later said Fotis seemed flustered. He had a look that cops recognize — a person trying to maintain composure, trying to hide out in the open.


	Fotis spoke first, another mistake. If you are meeting with police, you should volunteer nothing; even your tone of voice can give you away. Let the police start by telling you what they know.


	Fotis asked if there'd been any news about his wife. One cop said no.


	The other said that's why Fotis was there; they needed his help finding her.


	Then Pyetranker came in. He told the police that his client would “not be cooperating.”


	The officers said they were “surprised Dulos would not help.” Pyetranker said he and his client would be leaving.


	Pyetranker handed something to Dulos.


	“Is that your phone?” one of the cops asked. Fotis said, “Yes.”


	The cop asked to see it.


	As if subject to mind control, Fotis handed his phone to Officer Allegro.

	











	The cop tapped the screen until the security prompt appeared. “What's the code?” he asked Fotis.


	“0—0—0—0.”


	Officer Allegro typed it in.


	Pyetranker protested, saying that the police officers were not al- lowed to look at Fotis's phone.


	“I'm not looking at it,” said Officer Allegro. “I'm securing the phone and data it contains.” He added that he was putting the phone in air- plane mode until he could get a search warrant.


	Pyetranker stared at the cop. The cop stared back. Now and then, when someone is thinking very deeply, you can almost hear the gears turning.


	Pyetranker said he needed to confer with his client alone. They went outside to talk. A moment later, without saying goodbye to the police, Fotis and his lawyer got in their cars and drove away.


	WAS FOTIS DULOS CAPABLE of murder? That was a key question for the police and a stumbling block for friends. Here was a man who had never been arrested, who, as far as anyone knew, had never committed a violent act, not even during the most intense marital squabbles. How could he suddenly become a killer?


	I asked professionals, criminologists, cops, and psychiatrists if a person who commits murder is on the same spectrum as everyone else. That is, can an otherwise healthy person become a person who kills, not in self-defense or in the heat of battle, but with cool premeditation? Or are killers different from the rest of us? There is no consensus, but, according to research, nearly 5 percent of the human population can be classified as psychopathic.


	For those closest to Fotis, the best defense can be summed up in one sentence: He was simply not capable of murder. Ethan Fry, writing for the Stamford Advocate in July 2019, described his interview with Fotis's sister, Rena Dulos Kyrimi: “[She] is an architect in Athens, where she said Fotis still has many friends and family members who do not believe he would be capable of harming his wife.” As Fotis was growing up, Rena, who was thirteen years older, had operated as something like a guardian. “I almost raised him,” Rena told Fry. “I know him so very well.”


	Those who had seen Fotis and Jennifer argue in Farmington disagree. “I was there when they fought on the lawn,” a neighbor told me. “I was there when he got angry. I heard his sick revenge fantasies. I heard him say what he was going to do to this or that person. I don't know what he did or did not do to Jennifer, but I did not consider him harmless.” 

	











	FOTIS LEFT MESSAGES FOR LAUREN Almeida, the nanny, on the afternoon of Jennifer's disappearance, then left several more that night. He said he was merely checking in, but what he really wanted was the children. If step one had been “Disappear Jennifer,” step two was “Get the kids.”


	Lauren texted back to tell him the kids were healthy and safe. “Thanks for your response,” wrote Fotis. “Please send me updates every three hours. I do not want to feel that I am pestering you, but please understand that I am the father and I am extremely concerned with the situation.”


	He asked, for the second time, if everyone was together at his mother-in-law Gloria's apartment in Manhattan. Lauren did not respond. Then, at noon on Sunday, May 26, Fotis showed up in Gloria's Fifth Avenue lobby. He tried to walk straight to the elevators, but the doorman stopped him. He'd been told to watch for Fotis. If he turns up, the doorman was instructed, don't let him in. “He is unwelcome in Gloria's residence.”


	For a moment, while arguing with the doorman, the glassy veneer that Fotis wore all through these tragic hours fell away. He must've known this was his best and possibly only chance: Get the kids and go. Argentina. Greece. The world has amnesia. If you stay away long enough, everything will be forgotten. But if you don't escape now, you'll be trapped like a fly in glue.


	He and the doorman argued. Grunts and curses, the shuffle of loafers on waxed marble. Gloria was in the apartment with Lauren and the kids. Carrie Luft, Jennifer's friend, was in the apartment with Gloria, Lauren, and the kids. What were the kids thinking? They loved their father. He was so close, an elevator ride away, and yet, though they could not know it, he was already gone.


	Carrie called 911. Cops from the New York Police Department were there in minutes. They broke up the fight, talked to the doorman, talked to Fotis. He told them that his mother-in-law had abducted his children. He was there to take them home. The New York cops called the police station in New Canaan, where an officer said, “Fotis Dulos is prohibited by court order from visiting with his children unsupervised.”


	The cops told Dulos to leave. Go away, cool off. According to the NYPD, “Dulos ultimately complied.” That “ultimately” suggests Fotis was not so quick to walk away.


	On Tuesday morning, May 28, Fotis's new divorce lawyer — Michael Rose, the third man on the case  —filed papers asking that Fotis Dulos be given full custody of the Dulos children.

	











	The timeline:


	Jennifer disappears on Friday, May 24.


	Fotis shows up at Gloria's building on Sunday, May 26. Fotis files for full custody on Tuesday, May 28.


	Why full custody?


	Maybe because he knew Jennifer was never coming back.

	A new Spike Lee movie is still a calendar-clearing event; in the near 30 years since She's Gotta Have It helped kickstart the Amerindie boom and introduced the world to a brash, trash-talking auteur from Brooklyn, he's given us era-defining statements and eccentric sidebars, epic biopics and intimate performance movies, blockbusters and docs, highs and lows. His place in the canon is assured. It's still always a dice roll, of course, and you never know which Spike you're going to get — the crank, the cinephile, the cut-up, the muckraker, the messmaker, the master craftsman, the man with so much trouble on his mind — once the lights go down. Best case scenario, you get all of them, each one duking it out for stage time.


Highest 2 Lowest gives the majority of those Spikes a chance to step into the ring, though in terms of where this falls on the quality scale of his filmography, it's ironically right smack dab in the middle. An adaptation of Ed McBain's 1959 novel King's Ransom — as well as a remake of/riff on Akira Kurosawa's 1963 police procedural take on the material, High and Low — it evenly splits the difference between straight-down-the-middle morality drama and an idiosyncratic mixtape of things Lee holds near and dear to his heart. Those expecting another Oldboy, his oddly stock 2013 redo of Park Chan-wook's Oedipal nightmare, will be pleasantly surprised by how personal this feels. Folks hoping for the hug-the-corners heights of his extraordinary heist flick Inside Man (2006) may find themselves squirming restlessly in their seats. Regardless, it pairs him with one of his best collaborators, and once again makes the case that few actors do the right thing better than Denzel Washington.

	











	Ah yes, Denzel. Comfortably settled into an éminence grise period that includes well-tested action heroes, larger-than-life villains, and Shakespearean heavy hitters, he's now moved into an intriguing phase of his career that laces his usual rigor with a late-act looseness. We take his gravitas for granted, but he's throwing curveballs into that imposing sense of authority in a way that feels unpredictable, volatile, compelling in a different way. He's still the same capital-letter Movie Star he's always been, still the same leading man you want to follow. There's just an extra level of DGAF playfulness going on now. Once upon a time, you could look at a live-wire, lit-fuse Denzel performance like the one that nabbed him an Oscar in Training Day (2001) as the notable exception. It's turned into the rule. King Kong will never have shit on him.

	Lee knows all of this. And after kicking off their fifth movie together with a swooping aerial shot of New York City set to Roger and Hammerstein's anthem “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'” (it's not quite the jaw-dropper of the Aaron Copland-scored opening of He Got Game, but it still brings the grandeur), the filmmaker gives his star a foundation to start flexing. In both the book and the Kurosawa film, the tycoon at the center of the story's conflict is in the shoe business. Lee upgrades his version by resetting it in the music industry. Washington's mogul, David King, a.k.a. “King David,” is part Berry Gordy, part Irv Gotti, and a little bit of this guy minus the, um, other stuff. He has the best ears in the biz, though his heyday as the head of Stackin' Hits Records has long past. Now he's looking to make a deal that would allow him to buy back his old label and secure his legacy. King just needs to get corporate support and move some cash around. It's more complicated than you'd think.


	His wife, Pam (Ilfenesh Hadera), is concerned this is just an expensive ego trip. His son, Trey (Aubrey Joseph), is angry that his dad is blowing off promises to be more present. His best friend and driver, Paul (Jeffrey Wright), just wants his boss to be sure he's thinking everything through. Later in the day, a phone call comes in. Someone has kidnapped Trey. They want a hefty $17.5 million ransom, or else. King is prepped to give in to their demands, because nothing is more important to him than family. Soon, it's revealed the criminals have abducted the wrong kid. They actually nabbed Kyle (Elijah Wright), Trey's closest pal …and Paul's son. The question becomes: Will King still pay the ransom?

	This is the moment when Highest 2 Lowest starts to tackle the thornier issues behind its pulp-thriller surface, and despite both Washington and Wright digging into this dilemma like old pros (especially Wright, who modulates the character's rage beautifully), it's also the movie starts to struggle to maintain a pulse. There have been plenty of quirky Spike-isms spicing things up before then, from stylistic tics to a lot of flipped birds to Larry Byrd's old team; this is the type of movie where someone breaking the fourth wall and yelling “Boston sucks!” feels totally on-brand. But it also settles into a groove that risks being sluggish and generic. It could be any police procedural, made by anybody with DGA membership, that just happens to star a legend.

	











	Still, when Spike wants to turn it up, he rises to the occasion. There are two scenes in Highest 2 Lowest that feel like Lee is having fun while leaving his mark on his homage to a landmark crime flick. One involves the ransom drop, which involves the Bronx subway line, a backpack, a number of interchangeable pick-up men on motorcycles and an outdoor performance by Salsa icon Eddie Palmieri. Lee intercuts all of the action with Palmieri's 1972 hit “Puerto Rico,” and you can feel the voltage levels going into the red. It's a first rate interpretation of an old genre chestnut, the endless switcheroo hand-off, and the fact that it also feels like a political statement only makes it that much more exhilarating. A joyous public display of ethnic pride, taking place in the city that once housed a commander-in-chief now determined to strip America of its immigrant and/or nonwhite populations, shouldn't feel like such a radical gesture. But these are the fucked-up times we live in.

	The second takes place once King and the kidnapper finally meet face to face. Thanks to playlist of unsigned artists that his son had made him, the mogul identifies the culprit. It's an aspiring rapper named Yung Felon, played by A$AP Rocky. King tracks him down to the studio where he's recording, and two men square off over success envy, second chances, Felon's simmering anger over being ignored until someone's life is at stake. Then they begin trading freestyle battle-rap verses. None of the lines can be reprinted here in full, but trust us: Denzel has bars. It's also the kind of swagger-off that the star excels in, and that Rocky uses to prove he can match when up against a guy who's played Malcolm X, Macbeth and Gladiator II‘s power broker Macrinus. It ends sooner than you want it to, all the better for Washington to go full Equalizer on his scene partner. But it belongs in any future highlight reel of everyone involved.


	It's all over but the emotional healing and one last jailhouse debate after that, and Highest 2 Lowest gamely makes sure its loose ends are left tied. The impression is that you've just seen a great New York movie, with a great star turn at the core of it, and yet still feels like something's missing. It's ultimately an excuse to watch Washington go HAM. What's more interesting is the coda Lee throws in just when you think the credits will start rolling. Throughout the story, we've seen Washington's lion of the industry trying to recapture his roar, as well as looking at music business fixated on the bottom line and asking: Who stole the soul? Then he hears a new singer-songwriter croon, and suddenly, his sense of purpose feels renewed. It's not hard to make the leap from the music industry to the moving pictures, and how that industry might have lost its way. Lee doesn't need to ask who stole the soul there. He's just looking to renew his own sense of purpose and make something both crowds and his own inner cinephile might dig. You have to applaud the effort.

Shakira appeared on The Tonight Show to showcase her song “Antología,” offering an emotive performance in the midst of the late-night show audience. The Colombian musician revisited the 1996 song in an intimate, sing-along style, accompanied by her live band. 


	“Antología” appeared on Shakira's breakthrough album Pies Descalzos. The stripped down performance marks her second time reimagining an older song on The Tonight Show. Earlier this month, she and Wyclef Jean offered a lively rendition of her hit “Hips Don't Lie.”


	Shakira reflected on the longtime success of “Hips Don't Lie” during an interview with host Jimmy Fallon, noting that the single “changed my story.” “Since that song came about people called me Shakira twice,” she said. “Some people have used lie detectors on me.”


	Ths singer launched her Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour in Brazil in February, and kicked off the North American leg of the tour on May 13 at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina. She will also perform in Washington, D.C., on May 26 as the headliner of WorldPride DC.

	She recently told Rolling Stone of the record-breaking tour, “I learned that this is more than a show, this is a communion, an encounter with my most-loyal fans and also my newest fans. It's really a moment of total identification.… I didn't want to save any effort, I didn't want to save any resources to take the best show possible to Latin America, because I feel and I really truly believe that my people deserve the best.”

	She said that playing “Antología” always gets her choked up on stage. “It's the testament to this relationship that I have with with my audience,” she noted. 


	The singer added of her goal with the tour, “This has always been my mandate since I started my career: I wanted to show the world what Colombians, what Latinos are about. I wanted you to fight so much prejudice that we've had to encounter throughout the years, and this moment together is a celebration of who we are, how far we've come. I want the show to be representative of who we are as a community, especially during these hard times.”

Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Internal Revenue Service, Billy Long, is famous for mixing it up on the social media platform X, previously Twitter. Representing Missouri in the House, Long once earned the title of Congress' most prolific tweeter. 


	A Rolling Stone audit of Long's social media diet on X — in particular the publicly listed selection of accounts recently followed by his account — has uncovered a pattern of following sexual and “Not Safe For Work” content. A senior Trump transition official blamed this activity on “unauthorized” account access, insisting that Long would never have followed these accounts of his own accord.


	Long, 69, is a controversial pick to lead an agency that Trump has demanded target his ideological foes. Long's nomination has been dogged by his past promotion of a tax-avoidance scheme, and because he has touted a “dubious” credential as a tax professional. Senators have also raised questions about a flood of contributions from corporate interests that paid off Long's lingering campaign debt, received following his nomination. Long is scheduled for a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Tuesday. 

	











	Long seeks to join the Trump administration at a moment when the conservative political movement is in the throes of a pornography panic. A GOP bill in the Senate seeks to make porn illegal. Project 2025 — the arch conservative policy playbook now broadly being implemented by the Trump administration — calls for porn creators and purveyors to be incarcerated. As IRS commissioner, Long would also be responsible for safeguarding the information of hundreds of millions of Americans. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Billy Long has been tweeting since 2009. His current screen name identifies him as “Congressman Billy Long.” The platform does not show all of the accounts that a user follows, rather a selection of the 50 most-recently followed accounts. The publicly visible list of accounts Long has followed includes many politically canny choices, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, EPA honcho Lee Zeldin, as well as the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

	But Long's account has also recently followed many purveyors of adult-themed content. Some post content that is mildly sexually provocative. Other accounts post porn. The former congressman campaigned as a staunch “pro-life” candidate. The recent following activity on Long's account points to broader interest in pregnant women.

	











	One eye-catching account recently followed by Long's account goes by the handle “Pregnant Redhead.” This is not a porn account; quite the opposite. The creator produces content in the genre known as “trad wife,” which celebrates pastoral stereotypes of strong men and passive women, and posts images with SFW allure. 


	“I wear a ribbon because I am my husband's gift,” Pregnant Redhead writes in one post picturing her on a boat in a pond. The account also posts memes of women in head-scarves and dresses, with captions like: “You don't have to dress half naked to be beautiful.” It's not entirely surprising that a politician like Long might publicly follow a trad wife account, given the genre's resonance in right-wing culture. 


	However, other accounts followed by Long's account post unabashedly sexual content, including of pregnant women. These X accounts might be described as stealth porn. Nothing in the handle or the profile picture identifies the account as NSFW. But the posts are dominated by sexual images of women. 


	One of these accounts has only a single piece of content — a “repost” of an adult creator who lists her age as 26 and describes herself as a “big booty milf.” (MILF is an acronym for a popular porn category involving mothers.) The post caption reads “I fuck back,” and it features a video loop of the adult creator, filmed naked from behind, riding a dildo.

	Another account followed by Long's account has posted multiple images and gifs of adult content creators who are with child. These include teasing, clothed, video loops of an Only Fans creator named Erika who encourages viewers to “Check out all my exclusive pregnancy content.” The same X account has also posted a naked image of another pregnant creator, who advertises herself as a “42YR OLD NATURAL MILKY MILF!” A third account followed by Long's X account has only two posts, including a repost of a provocative image from an account with the handle “SpicyMoms2.”


	Yet another account that Long's account recently followed features a “pinned” picture of a shirtless man unzipping his female companion's top and a caption reading “THIRST.” The image is overlaid with a poem: “I yearn to make love to you hard and deep, invade the delicate folds of your wondrous need until you blossom all over my lips, tongue and fingertips.” This account also posts many pictures of women in high heels and lingerie.

	











	In response to questions from Rolling Stone, a Trump senior transition official insisted that the sexual content followed by Long's account was the result of a hack. “This is absolute bullshit and not something the congressman would ever do,” the official said. “Clearly there has been unauthorized access to the account in the 11th hour before his hearing, and we are currently investigating the matter, including reporting it to X.” (Trump benefactor Elon Musk owns X.)


	Long follows more than 8,000 accounts on Twitter. It is unclear whether the recent adult-oriented follows are in keeping with past practice. Rolling Stone requested access to the complete list of the accounts that Long follows. The Trump official declined to make that available. Subsequent to Rolling Stone questioning, Long's account appears to have unfollowed Pregnant Redhead and other sexually themed accounts.


	Long's account also recently followed a set of accounts that are interesting only because of whom these users follow — namely lots of adult content creators. One such account has a single, banal post from 2017. But the user's following list is predominated by adult creators. A second account in this vein features a single selfie post, and a following list filled with adult material. A third account also follows this pattern. 


	Long is seeking a position of enormous prestige and power, and also represents a Republican Party whose culture war has put porn in the crosshairs. Long's former congressional colleague Sen. Mike Lee recently introduced a bill to outlaw pornography. Project 2025, the conservative policy playbook for the Trump presidency, insists that porn is not protected by the First Amendment and that “its purveyors are… misogynistic exploiters of women.” It calls adult entertainment “as addictive as any illicit drug” and “as psychologically destructive as any crime,” and demands its creators and distributors be jailed and for the platforms “that facilitate its spread” to be shut down.

	The IRS, the agency that Long seeks to run, has previously been marred by controversy over IRS employees who looked at adult content on work computers. The IRS also must enforce tax laws on adult performers, who have unique tax situations, and have been implicated in complex tax dodges.


	It is somewhat difficult to establish Long's personal or political views on pornography. In part, that's because Google searches surface adult films — made by a completely unrelated male, same-sex creator who uses “Billy Long” as his nom de porn.

	Larisha Paul



Hannah Kobayashi still isn't quite ready to talk about what happened. In November 2024, the 30-year-old was reported missing when she wasn't on her scheduled connecting flight from LAX to New York City, where she was meeting a family friend. When she was found in December, having traveled down to Mexico in what was reclassified as a voluntary missing person case, she learned her father had died by suicide just weeks prior. Kobayashi hasn't spoken much since, but recently returned to social media to begin parsing through her emotions.


	Per SFGate, Kobayashi shared an Instagram Story over the weekend that addressed the nationwide search that followed her apparent disappearance. She thanked “every single person who dedicated time and energy into looking for me,” a search she previously said she was unaware of as it was happening. Kobayashi also loosely detailed the more harrowing remnants of the experience. “Every day is such a gift, especially after such loss and pain and suffering,” she said. “We should all learn to be kind to one another.”

	











	Kobayashi's first Instagram post since the incident was shared on May 3. She shared a grayscale image of trees in a forest along with a long, poetic caption. “For all that i have yet to say, the love in my heart remains the same, for every being that exists and those to come…,” she wrote. “To go deep within and bear witness to your unwaivering resilience is a true remembrance. More powerful than you could ever imagine. Rise up against tyranny, rise up against hate. Overcome fear~and nothing will ever stop you from becoming that in which you are destined.”

	The comments on Kobayashi's posts are still publicly accessible, though some social media users have turned them into something more closely resembling an interrogation room. One commenter demanded answers as to why Kobayashi didn't attend her father's funeral, while others urged her to “seek help,” while emphasizing the pain and suffering they blame her for causing her family. Some comments were more sympathetic, including one user who shared the grief of their own experience losing their father.


	“You don't know the whole story,” Kobayashi responded to the user who asked about the funeral. “My intention in this post is to acknowledge that I am going to speak about my experience — and to stand up against all the hate that was cast upon me. I hope that in your darkest hours, you are shown compassion and love versus hate and judgment.”

The base is no stranger to UFO sightings, but a January 2023 incident saw a mystery object smack right into the cockpit canopy of a $63 million F-16 Viper, causing damage and grounding the fighter, as per Federal Aviation Administration documents first reported by the War Zone.

These papers describe the culprit as ""an orange-white UAS,"" or ""uncrewed aerial system,"" a term typically used for drones. That very day, three more run-ins with these UAS were reported.

Ex-Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo spoke to News Nation recently, saying: ""What I can tell you is that there has been a lot of activity, a lot of people reporting a lot of things out of Arizona, particularly on the border"" with Mexico.

The FAA said it ""documents Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) sightings whenever a pilot reports one to an air traffic control facility.""

They added: ""If supporting information such as radar data corroborates the report, the FAA shares it with the UAP Task Force. The Department of Defense All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office serves as the centralized clearing house for UAP reporting impacting national security or safety.""

Unidentified flying objects, known to travel in groups of up to eight, have been spotted darting across the Arizona skies, particularly near military air combat training sites. These sightings have been reported since January 2020.

A whopping 757 similar incidents were recorded between May 2023 and June 2024, according to the Anomaly Resolution Office. Of these, 708 remain unresolved, with only 49 cases marked as ""Case closed"".

Following the 2023 Chinese spy balloon incident, procedures for dealing with such events have been significantly tightened. UFOs are now ""clearly being passed through multiple U.S. military reporting streams,"" as per War Zone.

Ron Vitiello, a senior adviser for US Customs and Border Protection, has speculated that these enigmatic drones could be tools used by foreign cartels for espionage or smuggling operations. After all, drones have been known to transport up to 10 kilos of drugs at a time for cartels.

In a recent chat with ""News Nation Prime"", Vitiello suggested that cartels, with their seemingly ""unlimited funding"", might be using advanced technology not yet seen before.

""Maybe they've got technology that we're not used to seeing in the drone space,"" Vitiello mused. ""That's part of their business model, to always be able to iterate and innovate, so that they can continue to sell their poison into the United States.""

Annabelle arrived at Black Swan Inn, a notoriously haunted location in San Antonio. Her appearance is part of this weekend's Psychic and Spirit Fest, drawing in curious thrill-seekers and paranormal enthusiasts.

The infamous haunted doll Annabelle has resurfaced, and this time, she's made her way to San Antonio, Texas, igniting online buzz and local curiosity. Annabelle's chilling tale dates back to the 1970s when she was gifted to a Hartford nursing student. What started as a sweet gesture quickly turned sinister. The student and her roommates reported unexplained movements and strange behaviour from the doll. Things escalated when the fiancé of one of the roommates was allegedly attacked. That's when famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren intervened. After conducting an exorcism, the Warrens claimed the doll was being manipulated by a demonic entity and took her into their custody. Since then, Annabelle has become a staple of supernatural lore, made infamous through The Conjuring Universe films and the Warrens' Occult Museum in Monroe, Connecticut.

In May 2025, Annabelle was taken on the road as part of the “Devils on the Run Tour,” a travelling exhibit organised by paranormal investigator Ryan Daniel Buell, formerly of Paranormal State. Buell has been documenting Annabelle's journey across the U.S. on TikTok, capturing millions of views and thousands of comments, many expressing fear, scepticism, and superstition.

On Friday morning, Annabelle arrived at Black Swan Inn, a notoriously haunted location in San Antonio. Her appearance is part of this weekend's Psychic and Spirit Fest, drawing in curious thrill-seekers and paranormal enthusiasts.

Annabelle's presence may seem like harmless fun, but eerie events are being reported. Locals near the Black Swan Inn claim to have experienced power outages, unusual animal behaviour, and strange noises since the doll arrived. One TikTok user, Laurie Boudreaux, shared that her sister's home, believed to be the former residence of voodoo queen Marie Laveau in New Orleans, caught fire unexpectedly. The timing has led many to draw paranormal connections.

Rumours have swirled online about 11 inmates escaping from a local jail shortly after the doll reached Texas. Though unverified, the coincidence has only added to Annabelle's mystique.

The Dybbuk box - also known as 'the world's most haunted object' - is said to have cursed beloved singer Post Malone back in 2018. 

The chilling artifact is currently kept under lock and key at a haunted museum in Las Vegas run by Ghost Adventures' paranormal investigator Zak Bagans. 

It appears on the surface to be nothing more than a vintage wine cabinet but inside it is said to hold a dybbuk - an evil spirit that can invade and possess a living person, per US Ghost Adventures.

The object has become so recognizable that it even inspired the popular 2012 horror film The Possession.

During the Ghost Adventurers' New York ComicCon panel, Bagans described Malone's visit to the museum in June 2018.

The ghost hunter said that during the spooky tour, he and the singer, now 29, decided to go into the room with the box before removing the protective case.

'It is a very powerful item,' Bagans, 48, said, per People.

'I didn't want to open it, I just wanted to take the case off. 

'To make a long story short, we began hearing things.' 

The pair soon began hearing what sounded like a 'little girl's voice' and Bagan said Malone initially sprinted down the stairs to get away from the exhibit.

But eventually, upon returning to the room, Bagans said that still 'something wasn't right.' 

'I remember putting my hand on the box and at that exact moment, Post put his hand on my shoulder,' Bagans recalled. 

'At that moment, it was like something came through the box and into him, and I began shaking, I began trembling. 

'This is kind of embarrassing, I began crying, I began screaming, and this is when he got me out of the room forcefully.'

In the aftermath, Malone claimed to see a dark shadowy figure lingering outside.

And, the next day, the singer allegedly sent Bagan an eerie photo of a massive bruise on his arm. 

'Mind you, Post is a person we've investigated with, he's a great debunker - very, very smart,' Bagans said.

In Jewish Folklore, a dybbuk is a disembodied human spirit - due to past sins - that wanders restlessly until it can feel safe again in the body of a human person. 

The word 'dybbuk' came from the Hebrew root 'davek,' which means to cling or to cleave.

The box initially appeared in 2003 when Kevin Mannis, an antique store owner, bought a vintage wine box from a 103-year-old Holocaust survivor on eBay, per US Ghost Adventures.

After a string of suspicious hauntings, the box was placed back on the site and bought by a man named Jason Haxton.

He eventually also felt the horrors of the box and buried it in Missouri before sharing it on Bagan's show. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

Home - News - The first extraterrestrial species: an unknown strain of bacteria discovered on the Chinese space station

Oleksandr Fedotkin

Author of news and articles

Chinese scientists have discovered in samples from the Tiangong space station a previously unknown strain of bacteria that has successfully adapted to existence in extreme conditions microgravity and radiation.

The microorganisms have already been named Niallia tiangongensis and are probably an unknown relative of the terrestrial bacterium Niallia circulans — a rod-shaped, soil bacterium. These bacterial species are able to survive in extreme conditions with the help of resistant spores. It is currently unknown whether Niallia tiangongensis evolved once in space or had all its unusual properties when it arrived at the station as a spore.

A detailed metabolic analysis and genome sequencing revealed that Niallia tiangongensis DNA contains sequences that are not found in similar organisms on Earth. These are bacteria are able to break down gelatin to produce nitrogen and carbon, which microorganisms use to form a layer of protective biofilm to protect themselves in extreme conditions.

New bacteria were discovered during a routine microbiological study of air filters in the Tianhe module in May 2023. The collected samples were sent back to Earth. Niallia tiangongensis demonstrated 200 times higher resistance to radiation than their Earthly relatives. They also successfully adapted to reproduction in microgravity and proved to be resistant to oxidative stress. Niallia tiangongensis can survive for a long time in extremely low temperatures and even in a vacuum.

These microorganisms can absorb cosmic radiation, using it as a source of energy. They have a special cell membrane structure that protects them from extreme temperatures and a unique DNA repair mechanism that prevents mutations.

Currently, these bacteria are of great interest to scientists not only because of their unique properties, which can be used in medicine, but also in agriculture and space. There are concerns about the biological safety of space missions, as some representatives of this species can cause sepsis in people with weakened immune systems.

More or less every Supernatural fan was drawn to the show thanks to the performances of Jared Palecki as Sam and Jensen Ackles as Dean. The pair are beyond synonymous with the series, and both have professed to being fans themselves, including having their own picks for best episode. Jared Padalecki's favorite Supernatural episode isn't just a fan-favorite or a clever detour - it's one of the greatest hours of TV the series ever produced. The actor revealed his pick after the show wrapped, and as someone who's watched the Winchesters battle everything from Lucifer to Leviathans, I can confidently say his choice is spot on.

Of course, Supernatural had no shortage of standout episodes. From heartbreaking character deaths to world-ending stakes, the show knew how to keep fans coming back. But it was also fearless in breaking the fourth wall, poking fun at itself, and letting its stars play in totally unexpected ways. Jared Padalecki's favorite Supernatural episode is one of those moments - a bold, hilarious, and surprisingly meta story that turned the show's universe upside down. It's an episode that only Supernatural could have pulled off, and one that cemented its place as a genre series that never took itself too seriously. This episode is, of course, season 6's “The French Mistake.”

In a 2016 interview with EW, Jared Padalecki finally revealed what many Supernatural fans had long speculated - that “The French Mistake” was his favorite episode of the entire series. That's saying something, considering Padalecki appeared in over 300 episodes and experienced nearly every high and low the show had to offer. However, “The French Mistake” wasn't just another case of monster-hunting for Sam and Dean Winchester. It was a total reality-bending twist that saw the brothers catapulted into a world where Supernatural is a TV show, and they're actors named Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles.

Jared Padalecki's choice makes perfect sense when you rewatch the episode with that in mind. “The French Mistake” gave the cast and crew a rare chance to completely shake off the show's usual stakes and structure. In doing so, they got to parody themselves, the entertainment industry, and even the absurdity of a series like Supernatural being filmed in the first place. Padalecki hilariously played an exaggerated version of himself - complete with lavish home, a very vocal love of alpacas, and a not-so-great reputation among the “crew.” It's a rare kind of comedic performance, and he clearly relished the opportunity to poke fun at his own image.

 What's interesting, though, is that “The French Mistake” isn't the only episode Padalecki holds close. In a later interview (again with EW), he reflected on how the Supernatural series finale also ranks among his favorites, largely because of its emotional weight and personal significance. After all, saying goodbye to Sam Winchester after fifteen years wasn't easy, and the finale gave him (and fans) a meaningful sendoff. 

Still, while the Supernatural finale was poignant, “The French Mistake” was pure creative chaos - and arguably a more daring example of what the show could achieve when it let loose. Jared Padalecki's favorite Supernatural episode reveals something crucial about the actor's relationship to the series: he loved when it took chances. “The French Mistake” wasn't just funny or self-aware - it was a perfect encapsulation of Supernatural's ability to reinvent itself. That, more than any monster or myth, is why it remains unforgettable.

“The French Mistake” is everything that makes Supernatural great wrapped into one gloriously bizarre hour of television. The episode begins with the archangel Raphael threatening Castiel, who sends Sam and Dean to an alternate universe as a way to keep them safe. However, this isn't just any alternate universe - it's our world, where Supernatural is a TV show, and Sam and Dean are actors Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles. What follows is a brilliant, off-the-wall meta adventure where the Winchesters are forced to navigate craft services, stunt rehearsals, and awkward celebrity interviews.

There's something deeply refreshing about seeing a show that's willing to take a hammer to its own mythology. 

What makes “The French Mistake” so brilliant isn't just the clever writing - it's how fully committed the episode is to the bit. From Dean's horrified reaction to his “fake” life to Sam trying (and failing) to act like Jared Padalecki, every scene is loaded with visual gags, absurdity, and inside jokes. The show even ropes in series creator Eric Kripke, executive producer Bob Singer, and real crew members as fictionalized versions of themselves, poking fun at the entertainment machine that made Supernatural a global success.

There's something deeply refreshing about seeing a show that's willing to take a hammer to its own mythology. At this point in season 6, Supernatural had already gone to hell and back - literally. “The French Mistake” hits pause on all that and reminds us why we fell in love with the series in the first place: its willingness to be weird, wild, and wildly self-deprecating. The jokes come fast, the pacing is sharp, and the performances are on another level. Jared Padalecki's favorite Supernatural episode earns that title because it balances pure comedy with real love for the show's legacy.

Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles played the Winchester brothers for 15 seasons of Supernatural, and here are their favorite episodes, explained.

Jared Palecki's favorite Supernatural episode also gave fans a look behind the curtain (sort of). While the version of Hollywood presented in “The French Mistake” is exaggerated, it's also filled with Easter eggs and inside references that longtime fans ate up. From fake Twitter beefs to producer cameos, this was an episode made for the fandom. While it could've easily gone off the rails, it's executed with such precision that it feels like the show operating at its peak.

While Supernatural was built on a solid formula (salt, burn, repeat) some of its best episodes came when it broke away from that structure entirely. Episodes like “Mystery Spot,” “Changing Channels,” and of course, “The French Mistake” are beloved not just because they're funny or strange, but because they remind fans how flexible and fearless the show could be. When Supernatural leaned into its own weirdness, it created some of the most memorable television of its fifteen-season run.

Jared Padalecki's favorite Supernatural episode is a perfect example of how the show embraced experimentation. “The French Mistake” wasn't just a funny diversion - it was a love letter to the show's cast, crew, and fans. It wasn't the only one, either. For example, season 5's “Changing Channels” had Sam and Dean trapped in parodies of popular TV genres, from soap operas to sitcoms, while season 3's “Mystery Spot” delivered a time-loop twist that was equal parts heartbreaking and hilarious. These episodes worked not just because they were clever, but because they stayed true to the characters even while tossing them into absurd situations.

That balance of the surreal and the sincere is what made these outlier episodes of Supernatural feel so essential. They gave the audience a breather from the apocalypse-of-the-week and showed that Supernatural was always more than just a horror series. It was a show about two brothers who could survive anything - even the fourth wall.

The superstar is abducted by aliens in her latest video from ‘eternal sunshine.'

Published on

By

Ariana Grande just added a fascinating new chapter to her eternal sunshine era. The superstar singer and actor has released the album's latest music video, an impeccable one-shot clip for “supernatural.”

The “supernatural” video was directed by Christian Breslauer and Grande. It originally appeared as part of Grande's short film Brighter Days Ahead, in which she portrays a character named Peaches who has successfully had her memories of an ex-boyfriend erased a la Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the 2004 Jim Carrey/Kate Winslet movie that inspired Grande's album title.



Watch this video on YouTube

In the “supernatural” sequence, Peaches walks through the scene of an apparent accident, strewn with flames and wreckage, under the darkness of night. She eventually approaches a spaceship hovering above, enters into the beam of light projecting downward from the ship, and calmly floats skyward.

The “supernatural” video is seeing release apart from the full Brighter Days Ahead film as Grande promotes the song as the fourth single from eternal sunshine. The album has already yielded the No. 1 smash hits “yes, and?” and “we can't be friends (wait for your love)” as well as the hit “the boy is mine.” The latter song spun off a Grammy-nominated remix featuring Brandy and Monica, who had a hit 1998 duet also titled “The Boy Is Mine.” Grande's “the boy is mine” video starred You and Gossip Girl actor Penn Badgley.

Upon its release last year, eternal sunshine set Spotify's global record for most streams in a day. The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 in the United States with 227,000 album-equivalent units, giving Grande her sixth No. 1 LP. Multiple deluxe editions of eternal sunshine have since been released, mostly recently eternal sunshine deluxe: brighter days ahead, which debuted in March along with the Brighter Days Ahead short film.

The range of reactions to his prostate cancer revelation reflects today's harsh political environment, as well as revived discussions about Biden's health as he sought a second term.

When a former president receives a serious medical diagnosis, the traditional response has been to set aside political differences, offer warm praise and wish the individual a speedy recovery and complete return to health.

In many cases, that's exactly what happened Sunday after former president Joe Biden disclosed that he has an aggressive form of prostate cancer. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Biden since taking office, wished Biden “a fast and successful recovery.”

But in a reflection of today's harsh political environment and reignited questions over Biden's health during his reelection campaign and his inner circle's handling of the situation, some Republicans and right-wing activists wasted little time asserting, without evidence, that Biden and his circle covered up the diagnosis.

Trump, speaking in the Oval Office on Monday, said the diagnosis was “very sad, actually” and that he felt “badly about it.” But he also questioned why it wasn't caught earlier.

“That test is standard to pretty much anybody getting a physical, a good physical,” he said. “We had the doctors at the White House and over at Walter Reed, which is a fantastic hospital. I do it — I did a very complete physical, including cognitive tests.”

Trump inaccurately referred to Biden's diagnosis as “stage 9,” an apparent reference to a pathology report giving his cancer a Gleason score of 9 on a scale that rises to 10 and indicates an aggressive cancer. Trump also questioned Biden's cognitive ability.

“If you take a look, it's the same doctor that said that Joe was cognitively fine, there was nothing wrong with him,” Trump said. “If it's the same doctor who said there was nothing wrong there, that's being proven to be a sad situation. … The doctor said he's just fine. And it's turned out that's not so. It's very dangerous.”

“Unbelievable this was missed, but the truth is, his physician was more concerned about assisting with the political cover up than providing world class medical care,” Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas) posted on social media Sunday night.

Jackson was himself White House physician to President Barack Obama as well as Trump. He drew attention in 2018 for an effusive report on Trump's condition, saying the president had done “exceedingly well” on a cognitive exam and had “incredible genes.”

The varying messages emerged as Biden thanked Americans on Monday for their “love and support.”

“Cancer touches us all,” Biden wrote on X in his first public comment about the diagnosis. “Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places. Thank you for lifting us up with love and support.”

Biden shared a picture of himself seated with former first lady Jill Biden and their cat, Willow.

His cancer diagnosis renewed debate about who should receive annual screenings, and at what age, for signs of the disease. Prostate cancer specialists told The Washington Post that it is not unusual for someone Biden's age to skip screening for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which, when elevated, can indicate a higher risk of prostate cancer.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which makes medical recommendations about preventive services such as screenings, explicitly recommends against PSA screening in men 70 years and older. For men ages 55 to 69, the decision should be an individual one, it says. The guidelines note that “many men will experience potential harms of screening, including false-positive results that require additional testing and possible prostate biopsy; overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction.”

Biden's prognosis depends on many factors that are not known publicly, said William Dahut, chief scientific officer of the American Cancer Society. That includes the degree to which the cancer has spread into the bones and whether it has reached organs such as the liver, Dahut said.

Ezekiel J. Emanuel, an oncologist and professor at the University of Pennsylvania who served on a covid-19 advisory board for Biden, said on MSNBC on Monday that Biden “probably” had the cancer “at the start of his presidency in 2021” because the former president “did not develop it in the last 100, 200 days.” Emanuel said later in an interview with The Post that the point he was trying to make is that the kind of cancer Biden had was “present” during his time in office “because this kind of cancer doesn't develop overnight.”

“I didn't say that there was a conspiracy,” Emanuel said. “I was very clear that he did have cancer, that's a fact. That he knew or didn't know, I don't know and they don't know.” Emanuel added that he “should have” clarified that his point “doesn't mean the president knew” he had cancer.

Oncologists specializing in prostate cancer said even aggressive cancers can appear suddenly or without symptoms. “It's certainly possible for more aggressive, advanced cancers to develop in a setting with low PSA, or develop and spread rather quickly, on the order of less than a year,” said Jason Efstathiou, a prostate radiation oncologist at Mass General Brigham.

Biden's life and political career has been defined by both tragedy and triumph — his longtime aide and confidant Ted Kaufman has often described him as “the luckiest and the unluckiest person I've met” — and the news on Sunday reverberated around the universe of former Biden aides.

“The first thing he wanted to know when I was diagnosed was, ‘Was I happy with my doctors? Was I getting the advice I needed?'” said TJ Ducklo, a Biden aide who during the 2020 presidential campaign was treated for Stage 4 lung cancer. “He right away jumps at that.”

Many of the responses Sunday and Monday, from Republicans and Democrats alike, were in a supportive vein. “This is certainly sad news, and the Johnson family will be joining the countless others who are praying for the former president in the wake of his diagnosis,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) posted on Sunday night.

But some took a different tone.

Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, posted an accusatory message just hours after Biden's diagnosis became public suggesting the Biden family hid his condition. “What I want to know is how did Dr. Jill Biden miss stage five metastatic cancer or is this yet another coverup???” he wrote.

Former first lady Jill Biden has a doctorate in education but is not a medical doctor. Trump's supporters often mocked her for using the honorific when the Bidens were in the White House.

Some of the criticism has focused on Biden's last medical report as president, in February 2024, when his physician declared Biden in good health and cited no prostate issues. Some conservatives say that exam should have picked up Biden's cancer, so either it wasn't performed or the White House is covering it up.

“Is Team Biden accusing the WH physician of malpractice? Or just lying? Again,” conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wrote on social media.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday reiterated Trump's supportive comments about Biden from Sunday night. She said that the two men had not spoken, but that Trump “would be open to doing that.”

Asked whether Trump was concerned about the quality of the White House physicians and whether they should have caught the diagnosis sooner, she said, “Not as far as President Trump is concerned. The White House physician we have here is phenomenal.”

“To the best of my understanding,” Leavitt added, Trump, who is 78, is regularly screened for prostate cancer in his medical evaluations. His latest report, released in April, included a Prostate-Specific Antigen level of 0.10 ng/mL, well below any levels indicating a prostate cancer risk.

For years, Trump and some of his prominent allies have been quick to embrace and spread conspiracy theories about political opponents, giving them a particular resonance with his supporters, said Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami.

“People who have a conspiratorial worldview or who don't like Biden for whatever reason will not trust information about Biden, and they will come up with their own explanations,” said Uscinski, who studies conspiracy theories.

But the situation has been complicated by renewed accusations that Biden's team covered up his cognitive decline as he pushed ahead with reelection. That charge is leveled in several new books, including “Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again” by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson.

“Original Sin” is scheduled to publish Tuesday — but now it will appear in a suddenly altered landscape.

The last few days have amounted to a striking sequence of events for the 82-year-old Biden, who is in the twilight of a long career after ceding the White House four months ago to a rival whose ouster was his stated reason for running for president.

Biden received the diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer on Friday, his office said. That evening, Axios published an excerpt from Biden's 2023 interview with special counsel Robert K. Hur, in which Biden speaks haltingly, including a digression about Beau's death.

“In 2017, Beau had passed and … this is personal …” Biden can be heard saying. “I know you're all close with your sons and daughters, but Beau was like my right arm, and Hunter was my left.” Hunter is Biden's younger son.

Biden's office announced his diagnosis on Sunday night, saying it “represents a more aggressive form” of cancer but that it appears to be sensitive to hormone therapy, allowing “for effective management.”

Some Republicans on Monday were trying to find a balance between wishing Biden well and continuing their attacks on his party. Vice President JD Vance said he wished Biden “the best” of health, but argued it was still fair to question whether his advisers hid his condition.

“Whether the right time to have this conversation is now or at some point in the future, we really do need to be honest about whether the former president was capable of doing the job,” Vance told reporters aboard Air Force Two.

“You can separate the desire for him to have the right health outcome with a recognition that whether it was doctors or whether there were staffers … I don't think he was able to do a good job for the American people,” he added.

Shaquille O'Neal offered yet another layer to conspiracies regarding the legitimacy of the NBA Draft Lottery. O'Neal, whom the Orlando Magic selected with the No. 1 overall pick in the 1992 NBA Draft, recently raised eyebrows when he shared the details of a conversion between himself and then-NBA commissioner David Stern that occurred three months before that year's draft. 

""[Stern] says to me, 'Hey, can't wait for you to come to the NBA,'"" O'Neal said on Ashley Nevel's podcast. ""Then he pulled me off to the side. 'You want to play where it's cold or where it's hot?' He asked me that. Yeah, he did. He asked me that. And I was like, 'Hot.' And he smiled, and I smiled.""

O'Neal ultimately got his wish, when Orlando won that year's lottery with Charlotte and Minnesota getting the second and third picks, respectively. 

While he didn't think much of it at the time, O'Neal is now somewhat skeptical when it comes to the NBA lottery and some of its outcomes over the years. 

""You hear a lot of these conspiracy theories, and there's a lot of situations that could make these things sound good and sound true,"" O'Neal said before making a reference to the Dallas Mavericks winning this year's lottery after they received a ton of heat from their fans after trading superstar guard Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers during the 2024-25 regular season. 

""It's very interesting how it all played out,"" O'Neal said about the Mavericks winning this year's lottery months after trading Dončić. 

By far, the biggest controversy regarding the lottery is the New York Knicks getting the No. 1 pick in the 1985 draft. With the pick, the Knicks selected center Patrick Ewing, who went onto enjoy a Hall of Fame career in New York. Ewing led the Knicks to the 1994 NBA Finals, but New York fell to the Houston Rockets in seven games. The Knicks never won a title with Ewing, but they do have a chance to snap their 26-year drought without an NBA Finals appearance if they can defeat historic rival Indiana in this year's Eastern Conference Finals. 

Speaking of O'Neal, he was the beneficiary of another controversial moment in NBA history, when his 2002 Lakers defeated the Sacramento Kings in the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers received several favorable calls during the series, especially in game six, a four-point win by Los Angeles that forced a game seven that O'Neal and Co. would ultimately win en route to their third straight NBA Finals triumph. 

As far as O'Neal's pre-draft conversation with Stern, it's a shame that Stern can't share his side of the story (he passed away in 2020). It's quite possible that Stern was simply making small talk with O'Neal, who is known to embellish stories. 

If his goal was to generate headlines, O'Neal has certainly done that. In the process, the Hall of Fame center has sparked another wave of questions and conversations regarding the NBA and its draft process.

A new satellite photo has revealed that the ""megaberg,"" A23a, is beginning to break apart, spawning thousands of smaller ice chunks around the Antarctic island of South Georgia.

Where is it? Scotia Sea, South Atlantic Ocean [-54.4957805, -37.7561759]

What's in the photo? Iceberg A23a, which is beginning to break apart alongside South Georgia island

Which satellite took the photo? NASA's Aqua satellite

When was it taken? May 3, 2025

A striking new satellite photo has revealed that the world's largest iceberg is starting to break apart into thousands of smaller pieces as it remains stuck alongside a wildlife refuge in Antarctica. But it could take months, if not years, for the entire slab to disappear.

The ""megaberg,"" dubbed A23a, currently has a surface area of around 1,200 square miles (3,100 square kilometers) — roughly the size of Long Island. It first calved off of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in 1986, but it became trapped when its underside caught on the seafloor. It remained stranded until January 2023, when it finally began to move away from mainland Antarctica. During this time, it has repeatedly held the title of ""world's largest iceberg"" as bigger bergs have come and gone, most recently regaining the title in June 2023.

The giant iceberg became trapped again in early 2024 after getting caught in a large ocean vortex. It remained spinning on the spot for several months before eventually breaking free in December 2024 and resuming its journey north through the Drake Passage — also known as the ""iceberg graveyard,"" where large Antarctic icebergs get swept away to their eventual doom.

But in January, it became clear that A23a was on a collision course with South Georgia in the Scotia Sea. By March, the megaberg came to a halt as it grounded on the seafloor around 60 miles (100 kilometers) off the island's southwest coast, where it became trapped for the third — and likely final — time in its lengthy lifespan.

Now, photos from NASA's Aqua satellite have revealed that the edges of A23a are starting to disintegrate, especially along its northern edge, blanketing the surrounding area with icy debris, according to NASA's Earth Observatory. ""Thousands of iceberg pieces litter the ocean surface near the main berg, creating a scene reminiscent of a dark starry night,"" NASA representatives wrote.

The numerous new icebergs appear extremely small compared with A23a. However, ""many measure at least a kilometer across and would pose a risk to ships,"" NASA representatives wrote. The largest piece to break off from the megaberg, which has been dubbed A23c, has an area of around 50 square miles (130 square km) and is currently drifting south (just out of the satellite photo).

This type of iceberg disintegration is known as ""edge wasting"" and has shrunk A23a by around 200 square miles (520 square km) since it became stuck in March, according to NASA. At this rate, it will likely take several months, if not years, for the berg to fully break apart, assuming larger cracks do not rip it apart first.

However, A23a may not hold its size title for long, because as of May 16, it is only around 12 square miles (31 square km) larger than the next-biggest iceberg, D15A, according to the U.S. National Ice Center.

South Georgia is not inhabited by people, aside from a few dozen researchers who visit throughout the year. However, it is home to an abundance of wildlife, such as seals and seabirds, including more than 2 million penguins, according to BirdLife International.

Having a large iceberg moored just offshore can be problematic for these species, especially for penguins that may have to travel several hundred extra miles around the obstruction to reach their prey, depending on where the iceberg is located. Meltwater coming from trapped bergs can also alter the temperature and salinity of their surroundings.



It is currently unclear how much of an impact A23a is having on the local wildlife. However, the iceberg is quite far off the coast, meaning it will be less disruptive than it could have been. Some researchers have claimed the melting slab could benefit the marine ecosystem by releasing nutrients into the ocean.

This is not the first time that South Georgia has been put under siege by giant icebergs. In 2020, one of the world's previous largest icebergs, A68, became stuck even closer to the island, sparking fears that it could disrupt penguin colonies. However, unlike A23a, it quickly broke up into dozens of sizable chunks after ocean currents ripped it in half, causing it to quickly melt away and thus averting disaster.

As human-caused climate change continues to cause increased melting of Antarctica's ice sheets, many more hefty bergs could soon pass by South Georgia in the coming decades.

The AI Race:

OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank hope that the site in Texas is the first of many across the US.

The future home of the first Stargate site in Abilene, Texas.

Trucks carrying concrete and electrical wiring plod over red clay, weaving in between cranes and excavators. Two symmetrical buildings stand in a massive plot of land where thousands of people in brightly colored vests work day and night to construct six more near-identical structures that will make up the first site for the Stargate Project.

Stargate is a collaboration of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, with promotional support from President Donald Trump, to build data centers and other infrastructure for artificial intelligence throughout the US. The companies have pledged to spend as much as $500 billion, a number so large that it's hard to believe it'll actually happen.

AI is improving more quickly than we realize. The economic and societal impact could be massive.

By Brad Stone

Share this article

When OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in 2022, people could instantly see that the field of artificial intelligence had dramatically advanced. We all speak a language, after all, and could appreciate how the chatbot answered questions in a fluid, close-to-human style. AI has made immense strides since then, but many of us are—and let me put this delicately—too unsophisticated to notice.

Max Tegmark, a professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says our limited ability to gather specialized knowledge makes it much harder for us to recognize the disconcerting pace of improvements in technology. Most people aren't high-level mathematicians and may not know that, just in the past few years, AI's mastery has progressed from high-school-level algebra to ninja-level calculus. Similarly, there are relatively few musical virtuosos in the world, but AI has recently become adept at reading sheet music, understanding musical theory, even creating new music in major genres. “What a lot of people are underestimating is just how much has happened in a very short amount of time,” Tegmark says. “Things are going very fast now.”

In San Francisco, still for now the center of the AI action, one can track these advances in the waves of new computer learning methods, chatbot features and podcast-propagated buzzwords. In February, OpenAI unveiled a tool called Deep Research that functions like a resourceful colleague, responding to in-depth queries by digging up facts on the web, synthesizing information and generating chart-filled reports. In another major development, both OpenAI and Anthropic—co-founded by Chief Executive Officer Dario Amodei and a breakaway group of former OpenAI engineers—developed tools that let users control whether a chatbot engages in “reasoning”: They can direct it to deliberate over a query for an extended period to arrive at more accurate or thorough answers.

Another fashionable trend is called agentic AI—autonomous programs that can (theoretically) perform tasks for a user without supervision, such as sending emails or booking restaurant reservations. Techies are also buzzing about “vibe coding”—not a new West Coast meditation practice but the art of positing general ideas and letting popular coding assistants like  Microsoft  Corp.'s GitHub Copilot or Cursor, made by the startup Anysphere Inc., take it from there.

As developers blissfully vibe code, there's also been an unmistakable vibe shift in Silicon Valley. Just a year ago, breakthroughs in AI were usually accompanied by furrowed brows and wringing hands, as tech and political leaders fretted about the safety implications. That changed sometime around February, when US Vice President JD Vance, speaking at a global summit in Paris focused on mitigating harms from AI, inveighed against any regulation that might impede progress. “I'm not here this morning to talk about AI safety,” he said. “I'm here to talk about AI opportunity.”

When Vance and President Donald Trump took office, they dashed any hope of new government rules that might slow the AI juggernauts. On his third day in office, Trump rescinded an executive order from his predecessor, Joe Biden, that set AI safety standards and asked tech companies to submit safety reports for new products. At the same time, AI startups have softened their calls for regulation. In 2023, OpenAI CEO  Sam Altman  told Congress that the possibility AI could run amok and hurt humans was among his “areas of greatest concern” and that companies should have to get licenses from the government to operate new models. At the TED Conference in Vancouver this April, he said he no longer favored that approach, because he'd “learned more about how the government works.”

It's not unusual in Silicon Valley to see tech companies and their leaders contort their ideologies to fit the shifting political winds. Still, the intensity over the past few months has been startling to watch. Many tech companies have stopped highlighting existential AI safety concerns, shed employees focused on the issue (along with diversity, sustainability and other Biden-era priorities) and become less apologetic about doing business with militaries at home and abroad, bypassing concerns from staff about placing deadly weapons in the hands of AI. Rob Reich, a professor of political science and senior fellow at the Institute for Human-Centered AI at Stanford University, says “there's a shift to explicitly talking about American advantage. AI security and sovereignty are the watchwords of the day, and the geopolitical implications of building powerful AI systems are stronger than ever.”

If Trump's policies are one reason for the change, another is the emergence of  DeepSeek  and its talented, enigmatic CEO, Liang Wenfeng. When the Chinese AI startup released its R1 model in the US in January, analysts marveled at the quality of a product from a company that had raised far less capital than its US rivals and was supposedly using data centers with less powerful Nvidia Corp. chips. DeepSeek's chatbot shot to the top of the charts on app stores, and US tech stocks promptly cratered on the possibility that the upstart had figured out a more efficient way to reap AI's gains.

The uproar has quieted since then, but Trump has further restricted the sale of powerful American AI chips to China, and Silicon Valley now watches DeepSeek and its Chinese peers with a sense of urgency. “Everyone has to think very carefully about what is at stake if we cede leadership,” says Alex Kotran, CEO of the AI Education Project.

Losing to China isn't the only potential downside, though. AI-generated content is becoming so pervasive online that it could soon sap  the web of any practical utility, and the Pentagon is using machine learning to hasten humanity's possible contact with  alien life. Let's hope they like us. Nor has this geopolitical footrace calmed the widespread fear of economic damage and job losses. Take just one field: computer programming. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet Inc., said on an earnings call in April that AI now generates “well over 30%” of all new code for the company's products. Garry Tan, CEO of startup program Y Combinator, said on a podcast that for a quarter of the startups in his winter program, 95% of their lines of code were AI-generated.

MIT's Tegmark, who's also president of an AI safety advocacy organization called the Future of Life Institute, finds solace in his belief that a human instinct for self-preservation will ultimately kick in: Pro-AI business leaders and politicians “don't want someone to build an AI that will overthrow the government any more than they want plutonium to be legalized.” He remains concerned, though, that the inexorable acceleration of AI development is occurring just outside the visible spectrum of most people on Earth, and that it could have economic and societal consequences beyond our current imagination. “It sounds like sci-fi,” Tegmark says, “but I remind you that ChatGPT also sounded like sci-fi as recently as a few years ago.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

In this article

D-Wave Quantum's latest quantum computing system has hit the market, the company said Tuesday. The company's shares popped 32%.

The quantum computer, known as Advantage2, marks its sixth iteration and most advanced system, the company said.

""It's an engineering marvel, with substantial technical advancements that highlight D-Wave's progress in scaling quantum technology to meet industry demands for growing computational processing power while maintaining energy efficiency,"" said CEO Alan Baratz in a press release.

D-Wave said the computer, accessible through its cloud service, offers a 40% boost in energy scale, and reduces noise by 75%. Advantage2 also uses an updated system with 20-way connectivity that can use fewer qubits to solve problems. A qubit, or quantum bit, refers to a unit used to encode data in quantum computers.

Recent quantum announcements from major technology giants have boosted optimism in the sector that promises to solve intricate computing tasks unachievable by regular computers.

Google debuted its latest quantum computing chip known as ""Willow"" in December, while Microsoft launched its first quantum chip earlier this year.

But some quantum experts and tech CEOs have cast doubt on how soon quantum applications can hit the market.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in January said that 15 years was on the ""early side"" for ""very useful"" quantum computers, sending quantum stocks spiraling. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg also tempered expectations for the sector.

Huang later walked back those comments at a company event in March, with D-Wave's Baratz and other quantum executives in attendance. Baratz told CNBC shortly after the initial comments that Huang was ""dead wrong"" about quantum computing.

Other quantum computing stocks edged higher on the news, including Quantum Computing, Rigetti Computing and IonQ.

Canada's main stock index rose to a record high on Tuesday, led by gains in metal mining shares, as investors parsed the country's mixed inflation data while awaiting trade developments.

At 1:09 p.m. ET, the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was up 117.40 points, or 0.45%, at 26,089.61. The index had closed on record highs in the previous two sessions.

Data released on Tuesday showed that Canada's annual inflation rate eased to 1.7% in April as energy prices dropped sharply after the removal of a federal consumer carbon tax, but core inflation edged up.

Two of the three core inflation measures, which are closely watched by the Bank of Canada, hit 13-month highs.

Later on Tuesday, finance leaders from the Group of Seven industrialized democracies will meet in Canada. They will strive for unity on non-tariff issues, but may have trouble reaching consensus with a Trump administration intent on pushing allies to serve U.S. interests.

“All eyes are on the G7 this week ... Obviously we saw the U.S.-China deal easing some global tensions, I think that the framework might be in place this week when the G7 meets for some favorable results to ease all the trade fears,” said Michael Constantino, CEO of online investment platform Webull Canada.

“As we've seen over the last couple months, the U.S. has negotiated 60 plus deals ... so I believe that trend will continue and each country will look out for themselves.”

On TSX, mining stocks rose nearly 3% on Tuesday after gold prices increased slightly.

But the energy subindex fell 0.1% as oil prices steadied due to uncertainty in U.S.-Iran negotiations and Russia-Ukraine peace talks.

Information and technology stocks fell 1.7%, with bitcoin miner Bitfarms leading declines in the subindex with a 3.8% drop. 

 U.S. stock indexes are drifting lower on Tuesday, as momentum slows for Wall Street after it rallied from a deep hole nearly all the way back to its all-time high set earlier this year.

The S&P 500 was down 0.3% in afternoon trading but still within 3.2% of its record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 133 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% lower.

Treasury yields were also drifting in the bond market, while the value of the U.S. dollar was relatively stable against other currencies following a brief jolt Monday morning after Moody's Ratings said the U.S. government no longer deserves a top-tier credit rating because of worries about its spiraling debt.

Companies in the travel industry fell to some of the U.S. stock market's worst losses, as doubts continue about how much U.S. households will be able to spend on vacations. Airbnb dropped 2.6%, Norwegian Cruise Line fell 3.1% and Las Vegas Sands lost 1.9%.

On the winning side of Wall Street was D-Wave Quantum, which jumped 28.2% after releasing its latest quantum computing system. The company says it can solve complex problems beyond the reach of classical computers.

Home Depot slipped 0.6% after it reported better revenue than analysts expected for the start of the year, though its profit came up just short of forecasts. Perhaps more importantly for Wall Street, the home-improvement retailer also said it's sticking with its forecasts for profit and sales growth over the full year.

That's counter to a growing number of companies, which have recently said tariffs and uncertainty about the economy are making it difficult to guess what the upcoming year will bring. President Donald Trump has launched stiff tariffs against trading partners, only to delay or roll many of them back. Traders are hopeful that Trump will eventually lower his tariffs after reaching trade deals with other countries, but that's not a certainty.

Target and Home Depot rival Lowe's will report their latest results on Wednesday.

In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.48% from 4.46% late Monday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for action by the Federal Reserve, edged down to 3.96% from 3.97% late Monday.

Concern still remains that Trump's tariffs could push the U.S. economy into a recession, even if it's held up OK for the time being. If a recession does happen, the U.S. government may have less room to offer support for the economy through big spending plans or direct stimulus checks to households than in prior downturns. That's because the U.S. government's debt is so much higher now, and it could be set to get even bigger with Washington debating more cuts to taxes.

If the U.S. government can't offer as much fiscal support for the economy, that could make the next recession deeper and last longer, according to James Egelhof, chief U.S. economist and other strategists at BNP Paribas. That could put more pressure on the Federal Reserve to prop up the economy by itself through lower interest rates.

Other central banks around the world have already begun cutting interest rates.

China's central bank made its first cut to its loan prime rates in seven months in a move welcomed by investors eager for more stimulus as the world's second-largest economy feels the pinch of Trump's higher tariffs. Tuesday's cuts probably won't be the last this year, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report.

The Reserve Bank of Australia reduced its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of percentage point for a second time this year, to 3.85%, judging inflation to be within its target range. The earlier reduction, in February, was Australia's first rate cut since October 2020.

Following the cuts, stock indexes rose across much of the world. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 1.5% for one of the bigger gains.

Shares in China's CATL, the world's largest maker of electric batteries, jumped 16.4% in its Hong Kong trading debut after it raised about $4.6 billion in the world's largest IPO this year. Its shares traded in Shenzhen, mainland China's smaller share market after Shanghai, gained 1.2% after dipping earlier in the day.

In India, a boycott of Turkey over Ankara's support for Pakistan in the current conflict is widening, hitting tourism, trade, education and aviation. 

A multipronged boycott of Turkey — driven by public sentiment in India and strengthened by social media campaigns — has already had an economic and diplomatic impact.

Two weeks ago, deadly fighting erupted between India and Pakistan after New Dehli struck what it described as ""terrorist infrastructure"" in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

India launched the strikes after a deadly attack on tourists in Pahalgam town in India-administered Kashmir, in which 26 mostly Indian Hindu tourists were killed.

New Delhi said the Pakistan-based group Lashkar-e-Taiba, a UN-designated terrorist organization, had carried out the attack and accused Islamabad of backing it. The Pakistani government denied the allegation. 

A rapid military escalation followed, with both countries sending missiles and drones targeting each other's military installations.

Turkey and Azerbaijan, Muslim-majority nations that are popular budget holiday destinations for Indians, both issued statements backing Islamabad in the conflict.

Social media campaigns and public outrage fueled boycott calls, with hashtags such as #BoycottTurkey gaining traction.

Tourism to Turkey, which saw at least 274,000 Indian visitors last year, has plummeted — with bookings down 60% and cancellations up 250%, according to travel agencies.

Popular travel platforms such as EaseMyTrip, MakeMyTrip, and Ixigo have suspended bookings, stopped promotions, and  issued advisories against non-essential travel.

Kerala Bharatiya Janata Party president Rajeev Chandrasekhar told reporters that: ""Every hardworking Indian who travels abroad as a tourist understands today that their hard-earned rupee should not be spent on those who help the enemies of our country.""

Last week, India's civil aviation ministry also revoked the security clearance of the Turkish aviation company Celebi, which provides ground services at major Indian airports, on grounds related to ""national security,"" with immediate effect. Celebi has launched a legal challenge to the decision.

While revoking Celebi's clearance, India's junior aviation minister, Murlidhar Mohol, said on X that the government had received requests to ban Celebi.

""Recognising the seriousness of the issue and the call to protect national interests, we have taken cognizance of these requests,"" Mohol said.

Traders have also begun rejecting Turkish goods ranging from apples and marble to chocolate, coffee and jams. At a national trade conference in New Delhi organized by the Confederation of All India Traders, over 125 top trade leaders agreed to boycott all business dealings with Turkey and Azerbaijan.

On the education front, the premier Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai joined several other prominent educational institutions, such as Jawaharlal Nehru University and Jamia Millia, to cancel agreements with Turkish universities.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long advocated a ""multilateral"" solution to the Kashmir dispute, something India has always opposed.

Erdogan has visited Pakistan on several occasions. His most recent trip was in February, when he arrived with a delegation to boost trade and military ties with Islamabad.

In 2017, Erdogan held talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on enhancing economic cooperation and counter-terrorism efforts.

Muddassir Quamar, associate professor at the Centre for West Asian Studies, told DW that Turkey's position on Pakistan is not appreciated in India due to Ankara's perceived unwillingness or failure to see the issue with impartiality and neutrality. 

""The expectation in New Delhi is for Ankara to see the situation not through the Pakistan prism, which is currently the case. Until there is a change in Turkish position, the ties are not likely to improve,"" Quamar said.

Prasanta Kumar Pradhan, a research fellow and coordinator of the West Asia Centre at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, also said that a rapprochement between India and Turkey is likely to take time.

Pradhan told DW that the boycotts would have a ""limited impact,"" and were ""not significant enough to severely affect bilateral trade.""

""However, if the boycott persists over an extended period, it could potentially have a more negative impact on trade relations between the two countries.""

India exported goods worth $5.2 billion (€4.64 billion) to Turkey between April 2024 and February 2025, according to Indian government data. Major export items included mineral fuels and oils, electrical machinery, automotive parts and vehicles, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and cotton.

And during the same timeframe, India imported goods valued at $2.84 billion from Turkey, including marble and other natural stones, apples and other fruit, gold and precious metals, mineral oils, and petroleum products.

It is still unclear how the boycotts will play out and what trajectory the ties between both countries will take in the coming weeks.

""For now, making high-level engagement with Turkey soon will be challenging. As a result, tensions are expected to persist for the foreseeable future,"" said Pradhan.

Air India recently lobbied Indian officials to halt budget airline IndiGo's leasing tie-up with Turkish Airlines, citing business impact as well as security concerns sparked by Istanbul's support for Pakistan, the Reuters news agency reported.

Even before the recent spat, India had terminated a $2 billion (€1.77 billion) shipbuilding consultancy agreement with Turkey's Anadolu Shipyard. The deal involved constructing five Fleet Support Ships for the Indian Navy at India's Hindustan Shipyard, with technology and engineering support from Anadolu. 

""Officially, India cited its policy to boost local shipbuilding capacity as the reason for the termination, but it is widely believed that India's discomfort with Turkey's close ties to Pakistan played a significant role,"" Tara Kartha, a former member of India's National Security Council Secretariat, told DW.

Sanjay Bhattacharyya, a former ambassador to Turkey, said that India needed to be smart and strategic, prioritizing its national interests and global standing.

""I believe matters will settle down over time and both sides will see sense at the end of it,"" Bhattacharyya told DW.

Canada's new prime minister is pushing to accelerate energy projects in a bid to decrease dependence on the US.

Canada's new prime minister is pushing to accelerate energy projects in a bid to decrease dependence on the US.

In his first news conference after winning the Canadian elections last month, Prime Minister Mark Carney laid out his incoming government's plans to tackle a “once-in-a-lifetime crisis” with the United States.

U.S. President Donald Trump's steep tariffs on Canadian goods and repeated threats to annex Canada helped propel Carney's Liberal Party to victory in the April 28 vote.

Now, Carney told reporters in Ottawa on May 2, the country would be embarking on “the biggest transformation” of its economy since World War II.

“We will work with provinces, territories and Indigenous groups to identify projects that are in the national interest — projects that will connect Canada, deepen our ties with the world, and grow our economy for generations,” the prime minister said.

“We'll make the Canadian government a catalyst for these projects, not an impediment.”

Indeed, a central component of the Liberal Party's 2025 election platform was a promise to streamline — and speed up — the process of getting major energy projects built in Canada, including oil and gas pipelines.

Amid a wave of anti-Trump Canadian nationalism, the plan has been widely welcomed.

Recent polls show a majority of people in Canada support moving away from the U.S. in favor of more economic independence. Many Canadians, including those who have historically been opposed to fossil fuel projects, also have expressed a new willingness to back pipelines.

Yet, as a Carney-led government moves to turn the country — home to one of the world's largest oil deposits — into an “energy superpower,” experts say Canada's obligations to Indigenous peoples must not be overlooked.

Under Canada's constitution, Indigenous communities must be consulted and accommodated on any project that could impact their lands, waters and way of life.

Some have questioned how Carney's push to speed things up will affect Indigenous rights — or be squared with Canada's commitment to upholding the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).

“To make Canada into an 'energy superpower,' that requires more extraction, that requires more Indigenous rights violations … and massive contributions to the climate chaos that we're already experiencing.”

“This notion of the ‘energy superpower' kind of deeply unsettled me,” said Willo Prince, education coordinator at Indigenous Climate Action, an Indigenous-led group working to combat the climate crisis.

“To make Canada into an 'energy superpower,' that requires more extraction, that requires more Indigenous rights violations … and massive contributions to the climate chaos that we're already experiencing,” Prince told Truthout in an interview.

Indigenous rights are inherent, but they were made constitutional in Canada through the Constitution Act of 1982. Article 35 of the act states that, “the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognised and affirmed.”

Since then, Canadian courts have laid out what this means in practice. 

Notably, they have upheld that the Crown — the government — has what's called a “duty to consult [and] accommodate” Indigenous people when considering an action that may negatively affect their rights.

“The duty to consult exists on what the courts have said is a spectrum,” explained Bruce McIvor, a partner at First Peoples Law, a law firm in the province of British Columbia specializing in Indigenous rights.

“Where the Crown is expected to decide it falls on that spectrum is a combination of how strong of a claim does the First Nation have, and how serious is the potential effect,” McIvor told Truthout in an interview. “The stronger the claim [and] the more serious the potential effect, the more onerous the Crown's obligations are within the duty to consult.”

Canada has also endorsed UNDRIP, the UN treaty that stipulates that states must get the “free, prior and informed consent” of Indigenous people before moving ahead with any decisions that could affect them.

In 2021, Canada passed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act to provide a framework for UNDRIP's implementation in the country.

But despite these commitments, for decades, Indigenous leaders have said Canada's approach to consultation has been flawed and failed to meet its obligations.

Many have accused governments at the federal and provincial levels of conducting a box-checking exercise — rather than meaningful consultation — and ultimately moving forward with projects despite community opposition.

In some cases, Indigenous leaders have also accused project proponents of seeking to divide and conquer their communities.

In one recent case involving a pipeline set to cut through traditional Wet'suwet'en territory in northern British Columbia, the company and government said they had the support of First Nations band councils along the proposed route.

Band councils are elected bodies that were created by the Canadian government to govern and oversee issues on First Nation reserves.

But in the case of the Wet'suwet'en, the community's hereditary chiefs — who, under Wet'suwet'en law, are the titleholders to the land — said they weren't consulted on the Coastal GasLink pipeline. They have stood firmly against the project.

According to Prince at Indigenous Climate Action, Canada most often treats Indigenous consultation as “just a footnote” in its push to build. “It's an afterthought. It's a consideration that comes after the conversation is done,” Prince said.

At the same time, Indigenous communities in Canada are disproportionately affected by resource development projects, Prince noted. They bear the brunt of the environmental impacts and other outcomes of such projects, such as displacement, health problems and heightened risks of violence.

“What we need to be focusing on is community well-being [and] place-based initiatives that respect Indigenous sovereignty,” said Prince, who is Carrier Dakelh from Nak'azdli Whut'en, a First Nation in British Columbia. “These conversations need to be returned to the people who are being displaced and dispossessed by these projects.”

Carney — a former central banker and UN special envoy on climate action and finance who has never held political office before — has promised that Indigenous rights will be respected and that First Nation, Metis and Inuit communities will be able to participate in project development.

More concretely, in the Liberal platform, the party vowed to set up what it dubbed a “one window” decision-making system to quickly advance projects deemed to be in the “national interest.”

The Liberals plan to create a Major Federal Project Office to coordinate the process, and they will require the office to make final decisions on projects within two years. 

The party did not say how the term “national interest” would be defined exactly, nor did it lay out which projects might fall under that umbrella.

But Carney said during the election campaign that he is open to “getting pipelines built across this country so that we can displace imports of foreign oil.”

Similar initiatives have been seen at the provincial level in British Columbia and Ontario — Canada's most populous province — in response to frayed Canada-U.S. relations.

The British Columbian government has proposed legislation that would allow it to fast-track infrastructure projects while Ontario Premier Doug Ford is pushing a bill that would create “special economic zones” where major projects can be approved quickly and without having to meet regulations.

Both proposals have been met with pushback from Indigenous communities who say they will trample over their rights.

The British Columbia bill gives the government “the power to override consultation with First Nations, environmental protections, and due process, all under the pretense of efficiency and expediency,” Chief Don Tom of Tsartlip First Nation said.

Back at the federal level, the Carney-led Liberals have said the goal of their changes is to shift “the focus of project review from ‘why' to ‘how.'”

“This will enable businesses to navigate regulations more quickly and with fewer redundancies. This office will uphold rigour when it comes to environmental protection and Indigenous consultation and participation,” the party's platform reads.

Yet the pledge to shift the focus of project reviews “from ‘why' to ‘how'” has raised questions.

“You automatically undermine, I think, the spirit of the duty to consult if you're starting point is, ‘How do we get to yes?'” said Leah Levac, an associate professor of political science at the University of Guelph who studies public policy.

Levac said Canadians should be asking, “What is at stake when we speed things up?”

“The reason these projects take a long time — although it tends to be wrapped in a blanket argument of red tape and bureaucratic barriers — actually also has to do with some fairly substantive commitments,” she told Truthout in an interview.

McIvor said reviews can take a long time for a variety of reasons, including unrealistic timelines set by governments or project proponents; governmental delays; or a lack of funding and other barriers that prevent meaningful Indigenous consultation from taking place.

“The general principle in the law is that consultation takes as long as it takes. If more time is legitimately required, the Crown needs to provide that time. It can set timelines but they have to be reasonable and they have to be flexible,” he explained.

McIvor said that ultimately, if Canada wants to speed things up, it needs to change its overall approach.

“Government should be coming to the table with Indigenous people asking, ‘How can we get your consent to this project? What do we need to do?' Without any pre-formed ideas or conclusions,” he said.

“It shouldn't be seen as a transaction,” McIvor added, stressing that Indigenous people are looking for a relationship based on respect.

“That means they need to be involved in a meaningful way, not just in the initial decision on greenlighting a project, but importantly, on the operation of the project on a go-forward basis.”
