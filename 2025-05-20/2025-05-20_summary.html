Pro-Palestine advocates say the announcement is a publicity stunt that will do little to end the genocide.

The U.K. government said on Tuesday that it is suspending free trade talks with Israel and imposing sanctions on some settlements in the occupied West Bank over Israel's recent escalation in Gaza — an announcement being slammed by pro-Palestine advocates as “grotesquely inadequate.”

In remarks to Parliament, Foreign Secretary David Lammy criticized Israel's recent escalation of its assault on Gaza and its lengthy total aid blockade on the region. He said that Israel's plan to forcibly displace all Palestinians from Gaza is “morally unjustifiable” and “wholly disproportionate.” 

“History will judge them,” Lammy said, ignoring the role of the U.K. and leaders of his own party in allowing Israel's genocide to reach this point. “Blocking aid. Expanding the war. Dismissing the concerns of your friends and partners. This is indefensible. And it must stop.”

He said that the government is levying sanctions on three individuals and four entities involved in settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank.

The announcement came after U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was “horrified by the escalation,” following a joint statement with the French and Canadian governments threatening “concrete action” against Israel and calling for a ceasefire on Monday.

The EU also announced on Tuesday that it is going to launch a review of the EU's trade agreement with Israel amid the current escalation.

The U.K. has been in negotiations for a new free trade agreement with Israel since 2022, launched under conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Lammy said the existing trade agreement between the two governments is still in effect.

The U.K. has long faced criticism from advocates for Palestinian rights for the government's support of Israel. 

The Labour government announced shortly after taking control last year that it was suspending 29 of the U.K's 350 arms licenses to Israel, in a departure from the conservative government. However, data analyzed by pro-Palestine groups has shown that the U.K. has exported thousands of munitions to Israel since the suspension took effect — raising questions over whether the U.K. continued supposedly suspended shipments of F-35 jet parts.

Advocates for Palestinian rights said that the government's actions do not erase the U.K.'s deep complicity in the genocide. 

U.K. group Palestine Solidarity Campaign called the moves “grotesquely inadequate” and called for a full arms embargo.

“Today could be a turning point, where the government begins to undo the depths of its complicity in Israel's genocide, by treating Israel not as an ally, but as a rogue state carrying out atrocities. Or, without further action, it will be recognised as just a last ditch attempt to salvage its reputation as a government that has enabled these crimes,” the group said.

“Suspending the trade negotiations is a positive step forward but without bolder action this will have little impact. Without suspending parts for Israeli F-35 fighter jets, the UK Government remains complicit in the deaths of thousands of civilians across Gaza,” said Halima Begum, Oxfam GB's executive director, in a statement.

“The Foreign Secretary should now suspend all arms exports to Israel and impose a full package of sanctions on political leaders and settlers in Israel who are seeking to erase Palestine from the map,” Begum went on.

Meanwhile, following Lammy's announcement, left-wing members of Parliament grilled Lammy to account for arms exports to Israel, which have soared under Labour, but he refused to answer.

“I just asked the Foreign Secretary why arms sales to Israel under this Labour government now exceed those under the Tories. He dismissed it as ‘clickbait,'” said MP Zarah Sultana on social media. “There's nothing clickbait about genocide. He has Palestinian blood on his hands.”

George Simion claims presidential election rerun was subject to foreign interference, like last year's annulled ballot

The defeated ultranationalist candidate in Romania's presidential election rerun has said he will ask the country's top court to annul the vote on the same grounds – foreign interference – that led to the original ballot being cancelled last year.

George Simion, who was defeated in Sunday's runoff by the liberal mayor of Bucharest, Nicuşor Dan, said on Tuesday he would ask the constitutional court to void the ballot “for the same reasons they annulled the elections” last year.

The election, which Dan won by a margin of 53.6% to 46.4%, was the second time the vote had been held. The first, last November, was cancelled by the court after the first round amid allegations of campaign financing violations and a “massive” Russian interference campaign.

The winner of the annulled vote, far-right firebrand Călin Georgescu, was barred from standing again and is under formal investigation on counts including misreporting campaign spending, illegal use of digital technology and promoting fascist groups. He denies any wrongdoing.

“Just as Călin Georgescu was removed and the elections were annulled, we will challenge the election of Nicușor Dan for exactly the same reasons,” Simion, an EU-critical, Trump-admiring former soccer ultra, said in a statement to local media.

“Why? Because there was vote buying,” said Simion, who formally conceded to Dan on Sunday night after first claiming to have won. “Because dead people voted on 18 May, and no calculation in the world can show us over 11.5 million Romanians voted.”

Simion has repeatedly alleged electoral fraud without providing evidence. His belated decision to contest the election's outcome, while unlikely to succeed, will prolong the political uncertainty in Romania, which is under a caretaker government.

The ultranationalist, whose supporters carried out a parallel count at some polling stations, said votes were “correctly counted” but “international observers” had seen “foreign interference” and “social media and algorithms have been manipulated”.

He claimed there was “irrefutable evidence” of meddling by France, Moldova and others in “an orchestrated effort to manipulate institutions, direct media narratives and impose a result that does not reflect the sovereign will of the Romanian people”.

Simion referenced a suggestion by the founder of the Telegram messaging app, Pavel Durov, that Paris had asked it to “silence conservative voices” in Romania. France has “categorically rejected” what it called “completely unfounded allegations”.

Russian-born Durov, who also has French nationality, is being investigated by France in connection with alleged criminal activity on the app, including child abuse images and drug trafficking. Telegram has said it abides by EU law and denies the platform facilitates illegal activities.

The far-right candidate said he had congratulated Dan on election night because “I love Romania, the Romanian people, and I never want to see bloodshed.” The count may have been correct, he said, “but before and during it, there was manipulation”.

He acknowledged there was “little chance that my request to the court will pass”, but said he was “appealing to all Romanians of good faith to … demand the cancellation of this masquerade”. He would provide those who wished with a template, he said.

Canada's new prime minister is pushing to accelerate energy projects in a bid to decrease dependence on the US.

Canada's new prime minister is pushing to accelerate energy projects in a bid to decrease dependence on the US.

In his first news conference after winning the Canadian elections last month, Prime Minister Mark Carney laid out his incoming government's plans to tackle a “once-in-a-lifetime crisis” with the United States.

U.S. President Donald Trump's steep tariffs on Canadian goods and repeated threats to annex Canada helped propel Carney's Liberal Party to victory in the April 28 vote.

Now, Carney told reporters in Ottawa on May 2, the country would be embarking on “the biggest transformation” of its economy since World War II.

“We will work with provinces, territories and Indigenous groups to identify projects that are in the national interest — projects that will connect Canada, deepen our ties with the world, and grow our economy for generations,” the prime minister said.

“We'll make the Canadian government a catalyst for these projects, not an impediment.”

Indeed, a central component of the Liberal Party's 2025 election platform was a promise to streamline — and speed up — the process of getting major energy projects built in Canada, including oil and gas pipelines.

Amid a wave of anti-Trump Canadian nationalism, the plan has been widely welcomed.

Recent polls show a majority of people in Canada support moving away from the U.S. in favor of more economic independence. Many Canadians, including those who have historically been opposed to fossil fuel projects, also have expressed a new willingness to back pipelines.

Yet, as a Carney-led government moves to turn the country — home to one of the world's largest oil deposits — into an “energy superpower,” experts say Canada's obligations to Indigenous peoples must not be overlooked.

Under Canada's constitution, Indigenous communities must be consulted and accommodated on any project that could impact their lands, waters and way of life.

Some have questioned how Carney's push to speed things up will affect Indigenous rights — or be squared with Canada's commitment to upholding the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).

“To make Canada into an 'energy superpower,' that requires more extraction, that requires more Indigenous rights violations … and massive contributions to the climate chaos that we're already experiencing.”

“This notion of the ‘energy superpower' kind of deeply unsettled me,” said Willo Prince, education coordinator at Indigenous Climate Action, an Indigenous-led group working to combat the climate crisis.

“To make Canada into an 'energy superpower,' that requires more extraction, that requires more Indigenous rights violations … and massive contributions to the climate chaos that we're already experiencing,” Prince told Truthout in an interview.

Indigenous rights are inherent, but they were made constitutional in Canada through the Constitution Act of 1982. Article 35 of the act states that, “the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognised and affirmed.”

Since then, Canadian courts have laid out what this means in practice. 

Notably, they have upheld that the Crown — the government — has what's called a “duty to consult [and] accommodate” Indigenous people when considering an action that may negatively affect their rights.

“The duty to consult exists on what the courts have said is a spectrum,” explained Bruce McIvor, a partner at First Peoples Law, a law firm in the province of British Columbia specializing in Indigenous rights.

“Where the Crown is expected to decide it falls on that spectrum is a combination of how strong of a claim does the First Nation have, and how serious is the potential effect,” McIvor told Truthout in an interview. “The stronger the claim [and] the more serious the potential effect, the more onerous the Crown's obligations are within the duty to consult.”

Canada has also endorsed UNDRIP, the UN treaty that stipulates that states must get the “free, prior and informed consent” of Indigenous people before moving ahead with any decisions that could affect them.

In 2021, Canada passed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act to provide a framework for UNDRIP's implementation in the country.

But despite these commitments, for decades, Indigenous leaders have said Canada's approach to consultation has been flawed and failed to meet its obligations.

Many have accused governments at the federal and provincial levels of conducting a box-checking exercise — rather than meaningful consultation — and ultimately moving forward with projects despite community opposition.

In some cases, Indigenous leaders have also accused project proponents of seeking to divide and conquer their communities.

In one recent case involving a pipeline set to cut through traditional Wet'suwet'en territory in northern British Columbia, the company and government said they had the support of First Nations band councils along the proposed route.

Band councils are elected bodies that were created by the Canadian government to govern and oversee issues on First Nation reserves.

But in the case of the Wet'suwet'en, the community's hereditary chiefs — who, under Wet'suwet'en law, are the titleholders to the land — said they weren't consulted on the Coastal GasLink pipeline. They have stood firmly against the project.

According to Prince at Indigenous Climate Action, Canada most often treats Indigenous consultation as “just a footnote” in its push to build. “It's an afterthought. It's a consideration that comes after the conversation is done,” Prince said.

At the same time, Indigenous communities in Canada are disproportionately affected by resource development projects, Prince noted. They bear the brunt of the environmental impacts and other outcomes of such projects, such as displacement, health problems and heightened risks of violence.

“What we need to be focusing on is community well-being [and] place-based initiatives that respect Indigenous sovereignty,” said Prince, who is Carrier Dakelh from Nak'azdli Whut'en, a First Nation in British Columbia. “These conversations need to be returned to the people who are being displaced and dispossessed by these projects.”

Carney — a former central banker and UN special envoy on climate action and finance who has never held political office before — has promised that Indigenous rights will be respected and that First Nation, Metis and Inuit communities will be able to participate in project development.

More concretely, in the Liberal platform, the party vowed to set up what it dubbed a “one window” decision-making system to quickly advance projects deemed to be in the “national interest.”

The Liberals plan to create a Major Federal Project Office to coordinate the process, and they will require the office to make final decisions on projects within two years. 

The party did not say how the term “national interest” would be defined exactly, nor did it lay out which projects might fall under that umbrella.

But Carney said during the election campaign that he is open to “getting pipelines built across this country so that we can displace imports of foreign oil.”

Similar initiatives have been seen at the provincial level in British Columbia and Ontario — Canada's most populous province — in response to frayed Canada-U.S. relations.

The British Columbian government has proposed legislation that would allow it to fast-track infrastructure projects while Ontario Premier Doug Ford is pushing a bill that would create “special economic zones” where major projects can be approved quickly and without having to meet regulations.

Both proposals have been met with pushback from Indigenous communities who say they will trample over their rights.

The British Columbia bill gives the government “the power to override consultation with First Nations, environmental protections, and due process, all under the pretense of efficiency and expediency,” Chief Don Tom of Tsartlip First Nation said.

Back at the federal level, the Carney-led Liberals have said the goal of their changes is to shift “the focus of project review from ‘why' to ‘how.'”

“This will enable businesses to navigate regulations more quickly and with fewer redundancies. This office will uphold rigour when it comes to environmental protection and Indigenous consultation and participation,” the party's platform reads.

Yet the pledge to shift the focus of project reviews “from ‘why' to ‘how'” has raised questions.

“You automatically undermine, I think, the spirit of the duty to consult if you're starting point is, ‘How do we get to yes?'” said Leah Levac, an associate professor of political science at the University of Guelph who studies public policy.

Levac said Canadians should be asking, “What is at stake when we speed things up?”

“The reason these projects take a long time — although it tends to be wrapped in a blanket argument of red tape and bureaucratic barriers — actually also has to do with some fairly substantive commitments,” she told Truthout in an interview.

McIvor said reviews can take a long time for a variety of reasons, including unrealistic timelines set by governments or project proponents; governmental delays; or a lack of funding and other barriers that prevent meaningful Indigenous consultation from taking place.

“The general principle in the law is that consultation takes as long as it takes. If more time is legitimately required, the Crown needs to provide that time. It can set timelines but they have to be reasonable and they have to be flexible,” he explained.

McIvor said that ultimately, if Canada wants to speed things up, it needs to change its overall approach.

“Government should be coming to the table with Indigenous people asking, ‘How can we get your consent to this project? What do we need to do?' Without any pre-formed ideas or conclusions,” he said.

“It shouldn't be seen as a transaction,” McIvor added, stressing that Indigenous people are looking for a relationship based on respect.

“That means they need to be involved in a meaningful way, not just in the initial decision on greenlighting a project, but importantly, on the operation of the project on a go-forward basis.”

“The real aim is to make it impossible for the Palestinians to return to these areas,” says a coauthor of the report.

A damning new report reveals how Israel is systematically making Gaza unlivable. The independent news outlet +972 Magazine has spoken to Israeli soldiers who describe how they have been using bulldozers and explosives to intentionally flatten Gaza.

In the southern city of Rafah, 73% of buildings are completely destroyed, with only about 4% of the infrastructure remaining undamaged. “The real aim is to make it impossible for the Palestinians to return to these areas,” says Meron Rapoport, co-author of the +972 Magazine report.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

We turn now to a new report that reveals how Israel is trying to make Gaza unlivable. It's been well documented that Israeli airstrikes account for mass casualties. Now the independent news outlet +972 Magazine has spoken to Israeli soldiers who reveal new details about how they've been systematically using bulldozers and explosives to flatten Gaza from the ground. For example, Gaza's Government Media Office says the Israeli army has destroyed at least 90% of residential neighborhoods in the southern city of Rafah.

The +972 report features videos Israeli soldiers shared online, like this one by Avraham Zarviv, who operates a D9 armored bulldozer. His nickname is “Flattener of Jabalia” — the northern town of Jabaliya in Gaza. In this video, he uses his camera to show a flattened landscape in Rafah.

AVRAHAM ZARVIV: [translated] Very good, Givati Brigade, very good. Yes, Rafah. “Rafah, end,” as they say. There will be no more battle in Rafah, because there will be no more Rafah. The nation of Israel lives.

AMY GOODMAN: For more, we're joined in Tel Aviv by Meron Rapoport, editor and writer at the independent Israeli news site Local Call and a columnist at +972 Magazine, where his new piece with Oren Ziv is headlined “'Render it unusable': Israel's mission of total urban destruction.”

Meron, welcome back to Democracy Now! Why don't you lay out what you found and these — the access you had, well, because they post them online publicly, to these Israeli soldiers' actual video accounts themselves of what they're doing in Gaza?

MERON RAPOPORT: I think that Gaza is being destroyed, and is already destroyed. This is not really new. We know that. We know that there are very few buildings standing in Rafah. What we have discovered in this investigation, Oren Ziv and I, is that this is a premeditated — that most of it is premeditated, that this is the routine work of soldiers today, or in the last year, or maybe more than a year, since the beginning of 2024. The routine work is to destroy, that this is what they are doing as a routine army service. They go out in the morning. They either accompany bulldozers or a unit that is responsible for explosives. They go, choose buildings and flatten them in a systematic way, and that the aim is quite — it is being said to them — of course, this is not official orders coming from the general headquarters of the Israeli army, but this is very bluntly told — they are being told, and they are themselves very proud of it, that the real aim is to make it impossible for the Palestinian to return to these areas. We have seen that now in these days in Rafah. In Rafah, we are telling that 4% of the buildings in Rafah are unhurt, undamaged. Only 4%, a city of 210,000, 200,000 people before the war. So, it is a systematic thing. It is not done by — it's not during battle. It's not even a result of airstrikes, although, of course, airstrikes are responsible for some of the damage. It is a planned thing. And in this, I think it is unprecedented.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Meron, you open your piece quoting a soldier you identify only as “Y.,” and he describes the demolition methods — and I'm quoting you — you write, quote, “I secured four or five bulldozers [from another unit], … they demolished 60 houses per day.” Six-oh. “A one or two story house, they take down within an hour; a three or four-story house takes a bit longer. … The official mission was to open a logistical route for maneuvering, but in practice, the bulldozers were simply destroying homes.” So, this is — to reiterate what you said, this is not in the process of a battle. This is supposedly after, let's say, there's been a battle or conflict, what the Israeli soldiers are doing. So, this is total ethnic cleansing of an entire territory, is effectively what they're doing, isn't it?

MERON RAPOPORT: Effectively, yes. Of course, this goes into some gray zone in the international law, what is called domicide, the destruction of whole urban areas. It is not officially a crime against humanity. It is certainly against the laws of war to destroy buildings that have nothing to do with military action. But, yes, I think this — there is no doubt that the intention here is ethnic cleansing. The intention here is to make these cities — Rafah, Jabaliya, the Netzarim Corridor, for the moment — maybe we are seeing something new in the next days — but to make these areas completely impossible — it will be completely impossible for the population to come back, because there is nothing left. And it is being said quite openly by the soldiers, by the videos that they air themselves, by soldiers who spoke to us. It is quite clear that this is the intention.

Now, the IDF, in its official response to us, said that, “No, this is a part of operational — there's operational needs that require this demolitions of houses, and this has to do only with operational needs, houses or buildings where there were — they shoot at Israeli soldiers, or there were explosives. Hamas planted explosives in these houses.” But what we are seeing is so clear. And again, Netanyahu, Prime Minister Netanyahu himself, said that “We are destroying house by house so they will have nowhere to come back to.” Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, said just yesterday that “We are not leaving even one stone standing.” So, it's very clear that the IDF reaction is not based on reality.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And did you discover any moral qualms among some of the Israeli soldiers that you interviewed about this practice?

MERON RAPOPORT: Yes, of course. The soldiers that talked with us didn't feel — didn't feel good or felt very bad with what they were doing. This is the reason they talked to us. We talked about it with about 10 soldiers.

But they also said that this is such a routine now for Israeli soldiers that they don't really — that most of the soldiers do not pay much attention, because this is the routine. This is what they do. There's very little real fighting. And one soldier who spent three months in the Netzarim Corridor said that he had very, very little real fighting in all these three months. And the routine work was to, if there were enough explosives, because sometimes there were not enough explosives, but if there were enough explosives, they would go in the morning, choose between five, 10 houses to demolish, and this is the routine work. So, the soldiers really were very used to it. And, of course, there were these soldiers that were politically motivated, right-wing soldiers, that really rejoiced in the fact that these Palestinian will have nowhere to return to. But this is not the main, I would say, atmosphere. The atmosphere is: “This is the work we are doing, and we just do it. That's what we are sent for.”

AMY GOODMAN: Meron Rapoport, I wanted to ask you about Microsoft's support for Israel. The Associated Press reports that Microsoft has now acknowledged “it sold advanced artificial intelligence and cloud computing services to the Israeli military during the war in Gaza and aided in efforts to locate and rescue Israeli hostages,” unquote. Microsoft confirmed this in an unsigned blog post. On Monday, a Microsoft worker who's a member of the No Azure for Apartheid disrupted Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's keynote address at the company's flagship Build event in Seattle, Washington.

NO AZURE FOR APARTHEID MEMBER: Satya, how about you show how Microsoft is killing Palestinians? How about you show how Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure? As a Microsoft worker, I refuse to be complicit in this genocide!

AMY GOODMAN: I wanted, Meron, to get your response to these developments and what we know about Microsoft's role, as you've edited reports by +972 on Microsoft, including one in January headlined “Leaked documents expose deep ties between Israeli army and Microsoft,” in a piece that was written by Yuval Abraham, who won the Oscar for being a co-director of the film No Other Land, Meron.

MERON RAPOPORT: Yes, it seems that this is — of course, there was this report by Yuval, and then there was a previous report quoting mainly Israeli sources, open sources, the head of a unit that is responsible for computing in the Israeli army, that she said that they received essential help to the Israeli war machine from these big three cloud companies, Azure and other — so, this is — and we had these documents that we revealed, that Yuval revealed later on. So, the relationship is certainly very close, and it does seem that this creates problems for Microsoft internally, and maybe externally and internally. We have to see. We have maybe other reports coming. I think this story is not over.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Meron Rapoport, you have — the United Nations reported in March that from March 2025 since the beginning of 2024, Israel has demolished 463 buildings in the West Bank as part of military activity, and it's displaced nearly 40,000 Palestinians from several cities in the West Bank. Could you talk about that? And also, you've reported that in Lebanon, Israel used similar demolition operations?

MERON RAPOPORT: It does seem that this has become really part of the Israeli war, the way, the modus operandi of Israeli army: destruction per se, not during fighting. We have seen that in Lebanon. We had reports in our investigation in which a soldier was told in advance that what he's going to do is to destroy the Shiites' villages in Lebanon, even before he came in. So, it didn't have anything — it didn't have direct relation to the fightings. And it seems that this —

AMY GOODMAN: Meron, we have 30 seconds.

MERON RAPOPORT: — way of action — it seems that this way of action is being copied and employed in the West Bank, as well.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to thank you so much for being with us, Meron Rapoport, editor and writer at the independent Israeli news site Local Call and a columnist at +972 Magazine. We'll link to your new article, “'Render it unusable': Israel's mission of total urban destruction.” Meron was speaking to us from Tel Aviv.

Israel allowed just five aid trucks into Gaza on Monday, but none of the aid has reached people in need.

Thousands of babies in Gaza may die over the next two days if Israel does not lift its near-total humanitarian aid blockade and allow the entry of a flood of food and other basic necessities, the UN's humanitarian chief warned on Tuesday.

“There are 14,000 babies that will die in the next 48 hours unless we can reach them,” said Tom Fletcher, the UN's under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, in an interview on the BBC. 

“This is not food that Hamas is going to steal,” Fletcher went on, contradicting Israel's narrative about humanitarian aid. “We run the risk of looting, we run the risk of being hit as part of the Israeli military offensive, we run all sorts of risks trying to get that baby food to those mothers who cannot feed their children right now because they're malnourished.”

The interview came after Israel allowed the entry of just five aid trucks into Gaza on Monday — a “drop in the ocean” of what Palestinians need. But any small measure of relief those supplies may bring is moot as even those trucks haven't reached any Palestinians so far, Fletcher said. 

“Let's be clear, those five trucks are just sat on the other side of the border right now, they've not reached the communities they need to reach,” Fletcher said.

Meanwhile, the UN has said that there are thousands of trucks carrying crucial goods like baby food lined up and ready for entry at Gaza's border, just miles away from the babies Israel is starving.

The UN said that Israel has cleared 100 trucks to enter Gaza on Tuesday — still a far cry from the hundreds of trucks per day that humanitarian groups say are needed to fulfill basic needs and relieve starvation for millions of Palestinians in the Strip. 

Though the trucks have theoretically been approved for entry, Israel may still block the trucks from entering the region; indeed, though Fletcher said on Monday that Israel had approved the entry of nine trucks, only five were ultimately allowed in.

The starvation crisis in Gaza is dire, with food insecurity experts warning that the entire region is on the brink of or experiencing famine after nearly three months of Israel's total aid blockade. It has been over a month since the UN said that its agencies had given out its last food stores in the region, with community kitchens forced to shutter their operations in recent weeks as a result.

Many Palestinians say that the starvation is even worse than Israel's bombardments, having been starved by varying levels of Israel's blockade for 19 months and with food costs constantly on the rise. The total aid blockade ushered in the worst conditions of the genocide so far; one Palestinian reporter said in March that children in the region are so hungry that they're drawing pictures of food in the sand.

The World Food Programme has estimated that there are 14,000 children in Gaza with severe acute malnutrition, a deadly condition marked by a skeletal appearance and extreme weight loss, causing damage that can last a lifetime if untreated. According to an assessment by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, nearly 71,000 children are expected to experience acute malnutrition in the next year due to Israel's blockade.

Dozens of Romanians have posted videos of themselves cutting up their passports in protest against the outcome of the country's latest presidential election. 

The controversial vote, suspended last year by the country's constitutional court, saw the pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, Nicusor Dan, defeat his Euroskeptic rival, George Simion, with 54% of second round votes. 

On TikTok and other platforms, Romanians living abroad began sharing clips in which they can be seen destroying their passports. 

“This is my vote for Romania. My vote is worth nothing. We will never return,” one woman said in a widely viewed video. 

“Romania is dead,” proclaimed another netizen in a separate clip.

The passport-cutting campaign comes amid claims from Simion and his supporters that the election had been manipulated by Romanian authorities, who allegedly coordinated with foreign powers to sway the vote. 

Simion claims that the electoral rolls contained some 1.7 million fictitious names and accused the government of busing in voters from neighboring Moldova.

Simion's Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) has also claimed that Moldova's pro-EU ruling Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) had directed its million-strong diaspora in Romania to support Dan. 

They point to an increase of over 70% in the Moldovan diaspora vote compared to the first round. Around 30% of Moldova's population are dual Moldovan-Romanian citizens. Their votes constituted almost 25% of the total of Sunday's turnout, according to the AUR. 

Simion had been a supporter of the independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu, a NATO and EU critic, who won the first round of elections in November 2024, but which were later annulled by Romania's Constitutional Court, which alleged foreign interference. Georgescu was later barred from running again in what Simion claimed was a “coup d'état.”

Telegram founder Pavel Durov has claimed that French intelligence attempted to pressure him into censoring conservative Romanian channels ahead of the vote. Paris has denied the claim while Romanian officials have in turn accused Russia of interference, but have not presented any evidence to support their claim.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has dismissed the allegations and has described the election as “strange,” arguing that the candidate with the strongest support had been “forcibly” removed without justification. 

Peskov reacted with credulity to Durov's claims of European interference, noting the EU's long history of meddling in the internal affairs of other states.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has also denied Bucharest's accusations of election interference and dismissed Romania's latest vote as illegitimate. Officials should clean up their own “electoral mess” instead of blaming others, she said.

A Democrat congresswoman has been charged with assaulting federal agents outside a migrant detention centre.

The justice department has accused LaMonica McIver of assaulting, impeding or interfering with law enforcement following a demonstration outside the facility in Newark, New Jersey.

Ms McIver and two other Democratic lawmakers were protesting outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Delaney Hall centre on May 9 when a confrontation broke out as a member of the group was asked to leave.

Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, was arrested and later released after spending several hours in custody, while Ms McIver, a representative for New Jersey's 10th congressional district, became embroiled in a heated discussion with uniformed officials.

“I have persistently made efforts to address these issues without bringing criminal charges and have given Representative McIver every opportunity to come to a resolution, but she has unfortunately declined,” US attorney Alina Habba wrote in a letter, posted on X.

“No one is above the law – politicians or otherwise.”

The charges against Ms McIver mark a rare federal criminal case against a member of Congress.

Ms McIver has denied any wrongdoing and accused federal agents of escalating the situation by arresting Mr Baraka.

She also denounced the charge as “purely political” and said prosecutors are distorting her actions in an effort to deter legislative oversight.

“This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right,” she said in a statement.

“I am thankful for the outpouring of support I have received and I look forward to the truth being laid out clearly in court.”

A two-minute clip released by the Department of Homeland Security shows Ms McIver shouting “surround the mayor”.

At one point, her elbows push into an officer wearing a dark face covering, but it is not clear if the contact was accidental or intentional.

Asked about the charges on Tuesday, Donald Trump said Ms McIver was “totally out of control” and that “the days of woke are over”.

“She was shoving federal agents,” the president claimed.

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, wrote on X that Ms McIver had been charged following a “thorough review of the video footage”.

“Assaults on federal law enforcement will not be tolerated,” Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, posted on X. “This administration will always protect those who work tirelessly to keep America safe.”

Ms McIver's lawyer called the decision to charge her “spectacularly inappropriate”, saying she went to Delaney Hall “to do her job” as a member of Congress to oversee the treatment of ICE detainees.

“Rather than facilitating that inspection, ICE agents chose to escalate what should have been a peaceful situation into chaos,” Paul Fishman, the former US attorney for New Jersey, said in a statement.

“This prosecution is an attempt to shift the blame for ICE's behaviour to Congresswoman McIver. In the courtroom, facts — not headlines — will matter.”

Ms Habba agreed to dismiss a misdemeanour charge against Mr Baraka “for the sake of moving forward” and invited the mayor to tour the detention centre alongside her.

“The citizens of New Jersey deserve unified leadership so we can get to work to keep our state safe,” Ms Habba said.

Mr Baraka released a statement saying he would “continue to advocate for the humane treatment of detainees” and “continue to press the facility to ensure that it is compliant with City of Newark codes and regulations”.

The baseless charges “should send a chill down the spine of every American,” said Rep. Greg Casar.

U.S. President Donald Trump's Justice Department announced Monday that it is pursuing assault charges against a Democratic congresswoman from New Jersey who took part in an oversight visit at a privately run migrant detention center in Newark earlier this month.

In a statement, Interim U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Alina Habba announced the charges against U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.), claiming the lawmaker “assaulted, impeded, and interfered with law enforcement” at GEO Group's Delaney Hall. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) awarded GEO Group a billion-dollar contract earlier this year to detain migrants there, even as the facility faced legal challenges and accusations of abuse.

McIver rejected the charges against her as “purely political,” saying that “they mischaracterize and distort my actions” in an attempt to “criminalize and deter legislative oversight.”

“We were fulfilling our lawful oversight responsibilities, as members of Congress have done many times before, and our visit should have been peaceful and short,” said McIver. “Instead, ICE agents created an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation when they chose to arrest Mayor [Ras] Baraka.”

Habba said Monday that her office has agreed to drop the trespassing charge against Baraka, who welcomed the decision while expressing solidarity with McIver.

“Congresswoman McIver is a daughter of Newark, past Newark Council president, a former student of mine, and a dear friend,” said Baraka. “I want to be clear: I stand with LaMonica, and I fully expect her to be vindicated.”

The U.S. attorney's announcement sparked an outpouring of support for McIver and grave warnings about the implications of the Trump administration's attempt to prosecute her and other officials who try to stand in the way of its lawless mass deportation effort.

“This is a clear political attack on Rep. LaMonica McIver for having the courage to stand up to Trump's abuses of power,” said Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party. “Let's be clear who the real lawbreakers are. In just the last week, both Donald Trump and [Attorney General] Pam Bondi have been caught with a hand in the cookie jar. Bondi sold millions of shares of stock on the same day that Trump announced his disastrous tariffs. And Trump accepted a $400 million luxury plane from the Qatari royal family.”

“The most corrupt administration in our country's history is targeting and punishing public officials who seek to hold them accountable,” Mitchell added.

McIver's fellow congressional Democrats also rallied to her defense.

Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) called the charges a “purely political act” and said that “oversight is not a criminal offense unless you are living under a fascist regime.”

The chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas), said that “the baseless charges against Congresswoman McIver for simply doing her job should send a chill down the spine of every American.”

A group of Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee warned that “charging members of Congress for doing our jobs is a dangerous precedent to set.”

“It reveals the increasingly authoritarian nature of this administration and its relentless, illegal attempts to suppress any dissent or oversight, including from judges, members of Congress, and the American people, which check lawless executive power,” the lawmakers said. “Representative McIver has our full support, and we will do everything in our power to help fight this outrageous threat to our constitutional system.”

The scene at Delaney Hall earlier this month was highly chaotic, with video footage showing jostling and heated verbal exchanges outside of the facility's gate as federal agents moved to arrest Baraka after three New Jersey lawmakers — McIver and Reps. Robert Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman — visited the inside of the detention center, which they have a right to do under federal law.

The Department of Homeland Security released a video claiming to show McIver “assaulting” an ICE agent, and one DHS official accused the Democratic lawmaker of “body-slamming” and “body-ramming” officers. McIver, who rejected the claims, said at the time that federal agents at the scene were “roughing up members of Congress.”

Watson Coleman, who is 80 years old, said she was “manhandled” by ICE agents as they moved to arrest Baraka.

In a statement late Monday, Mike Zamore of the national ACLU and Amol Sinha of ACLU-NJ said that “the Trump administration's political charges against Congresswoman McIver [are] a method more suited for authoritarianism than American democracy.”

“If the Trump administration can target elected officials who oppose its extreme agenda, it can happen to any one of us,” they said. “We demand that they drop the charges against Rep. McIver, and we implore her fellow members of Congress to call for the same.”

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

Over half (54%) of companies surveyed by insurer Allianz say they will have to raise prices to accommodate cost of tariffs

A majority of US companies say they will have to raise their prices to accommodate Donald Trump's tariffs in the US, according to a new report.

More than half (54%) of the US companies surveyed by insurance company Allianz said they will have to raise prices to accommodate the cost of the tariffs. Of the 4,500 companies across nine countries, including the US, UK and China, surveyed by Allianz only 22% said they can absorb the increased costs.

The unpredictability of US trade policy has also dented exporters' confidence. The survey found 42% of exporting companies now anticipate turnover to decline between -2% and -10% over the next 12 months, compared to fewer than 5% before 2 April “liberation day” – when Trump unveiled his tariff policy.

Though Trump has pulled back on many of the levies he initially proposed, key tariffs remain in place, including a 10% universal tariff on all US imports, a 30% tariff on Chinese imports and extra tariffs on specific industries like metal and auto parts.

Trump has insisted that tariffs will make America “very wealthy again”, though it appears that American companies and consumers are simply expecting to pay higher prices as the tariffs settle into place. In April, consumer expectations of inflation reached their highest point since 1981, according to the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research.

Instead of immediately raising prices, which could deter customers, many companies have spent months trying to get ahead of Trump's tariffs by stockpiling goods to temporarily circumvent them.

Nearly eight out of 10 American companies said that they frontloaded shipments to China before Trump announced his tariffs, with 25% saying they had started to front-load before the November 2024 election.

Inflation data from April showed that US price increases remained roughly level for the month. Economists say that it will take a while for tariff-related price increases to show up in data and companies have started to say they will pass some of the cost of tariffs onto consumers.

“Given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure,” Doug McMillion, Walmart's CEO, said in an earnings call last week. “The higher tariffs will result in higher prices.”

Toymaker Mattel also said that it would have to raise prices and that it would continue to manufacture its products outside of the US, “where [it] can be more efficient and more productive”, the company's CEO, Ynon Kreiz, told CNBC earlier this month.

The majority of companies (60%) in the report said they expect the tariffs to have a negative impact on their business, with less than half saying they expect positive export growth this year, down from 80% who had said the same at the beginning of the year.

While many companies are holding out on price increases, relying on stockpiled inventory and hoping trade deals will be reached soon, companies will have to raise prices in the summer if a trade war continues.

“Monthly business surveys … do indicate that companies will eventually pass on most of the tariff increases by the summer,” said Maxine Darmet, senior economist at Allianz Trade.

A mysterious virus that slowly turns its victims into marble statues, their spines and legs hardening and cracking. A timeline-hopping narrative whose twin strands majestically cross over to the mournful soundtrack of The Mercy Seat by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. And more shots of hypodermic needles being jabbed into arms and chests than an endless loop of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. These are the indelible elements that make up French filmmaker Julia Ducournau's new horror-drama Alpha, which made an explosive landing at the Cannes Film Festival on Monday night, blowing all previous competitors out of the French Riviera water. 

The follow-up to Ducournau's 2021 pretzel of a body-horror movie Titane, which walked away with Cannes' prestigious Palme d'Or, Alpha sent the black-tie audience inside the Palais into a polite frenzy during its world premiere. 

So much so that an audience member in the balcony had to be tended to in the midst of the screening due to a medical emergency, echoing the moment when, in 2016, several moviegoers passed out during a Toronto International Film Festival screening of Ducournau's debut feature, Raw. (This time around, the moviegoer thankfully turned out to be fine, and the screening continued uninterrupted.)

At once a metaphor for the AIDS crisis and a meditation on the million little traumas that are inherited across families for generations, Alpha follows three characters in various states of distress: heroin addict Amin (Tahar Rahim), his physician sister (Golshifteh Farahani) and her troubled 13-year-old daughter Alpha (Melissa Boros), who one day comes home from a disreputable house party with a tattoo whose imprint sets off a chain of cataclysmic events.

While Titane proved that Ducournau was a devoted student of David Cronenberg, Alpha reveals the director has also been studying at the tomb of Clive Barker, especially when it comes to imagining the victims of the unnamed disease, their beautiful but tortured bodies resembling both the creatures of Nightbreed and the Cennobites of Hellraiser. 

There is, to put it lightly, a lot going on inside of Alpha‘s apocalyptic world, not nearly all of which is digestible upon first viewing – especially one that didn't get started until close to 11 p.m. But as the crowd rose to its feet to award an emotional Ducournau a rousing standing ovation – no one needs to time these things to the minute, but it lasted far longer than any other reception at Cannes so far – it was clear that Alpha had hit a nerve. 

Which, by this deep into the festival, needed to happen one way or another. While a few in-competition films have found admirers across the board, most notably the Brazilian thriller The Secret Agent, before Alpha hit the screen, there haven't been too many in-competition titles to get animated about, either on the pro or con side.

Wes Anderson's The Phoenician Scheme, which screened Sunday night, is an emotionally empty exercise in fussiness, a steep drop-off from Asteroid City. And Egyptian director Tarik Saleh's political satire Eagles of the Republic, which screened Monday afternoon, failed to deliver on its incendiary promise of roasting Cairo's corrupt class.

Instead, the best bets as Cannes began to enter its final leg were found outside of the “official competition” films competing for the Palme d'Or. 

In the sidebar Directors' Fortnight program, Canadian director Lloyd Lee Choi delivered a knockout with his drama Lucky Lu. In his feature-length debut, the director, who was recently named the winner of this year's TIFF-CBC Films Screenwriter Award, traces a disastrous 48-hour period for a New York delivery driver (Chang Chen) as he anticipates the arrival of his wife and young daughter from overseas. A potent mix of Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves and the Safdie brothers' Uncut Gems, Choi's film (not technically a Canadian title given it was produced in the U.S.) is excellent high-anxiety cinema. 

Also causing heart palpitations, in a good way, was Spike Lee's out-of-competition thriller Highest 2 Lowest. An extremely loose remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1958 drama High and Low, the Denzel Washington-starring film premiered Monday just a few hours before Alpha, a nice bit of festival symmetry given that Lee's jury awarded Ducournau her Palme d'Or in 2021. 

Once Lee pushed his new film's unbearably melodramatic score to the background and let Washington do what he does best – devour the screen with an unmatched ferocity – the film offered a sometimes silly but ultimately electric ride. Especially once Washington was able to pair off against hip-hop star A$AP Rocky, who plays an aspiring rapper to Washington's record-biz mogul. Alpha, meet Omega.

MOSCOW, May 20. /TASS/. Ukrainian prison officials have proposed that civilians accused of political crimes be included in the country's list of 1,000 prisoners to be exchanged with Russia as part of the deal made at the Istanbul talks, the Strana news outlet reported, citing sources among lawyers.

According to the outlet, this would involve people accused of aiding Russia in some way and high treason. These include Ukrainians arrested for photographing military facilities and setting cars on fire, as well as entrepreneurs accused of financial crimes. Strana pointed out that Kiev's desire to expand the swap list may be due to the fact that, if the agreed "1,000 for 1,000" swap goes ahead, Ukraine could be left with few Russian prisoners in custody.

Russia and Ukraine held talks in Istanbul on May 16. Following the meeting, Moscow and Kiev agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, present their vision of a potential ceasefire, outlining all its conditions, as well as continue the negotiating process.

Kherson Region Governor Vladimir Saldo earlier supported the idea that Kiev swap civilians held for supporting Russia along with Russian prisoners of war.

BRUSSELS, May 20. /TASS/. Belgium is ready to deploy troops to Ukraine as soon as there is a ceasefire with Russia and annually provide the country with weapons worth one billion euros, Defense Minister Theo Francken told reporters.

"There is a task force of the coalition of the willing, and they are working under the leadership of the British and the French. They are developing a plan and working very closely together. The moment there is a ceasefire, we can immediately operate with the coalition of the willing on Ukrainian soil," Francken said upon his arrival at the EU foreign and defense ministers' meeting in Brussels.

The top defense official emphasized that Russian forces must withdraw from Ukrainian territory immediately following a ceasefire.

"We will keep on supporting Ukraine. We just approved a one-billion-euro package, and we will keep on supporting Ukraine for next years, [allocating] one billion euros in military aid each year," he noted, adding that Belgium uses this money to order weapons for Kiev from its own defense enterprises.

It's important that a significant part of this money comes back to Belgium and creates jobs in our defense industries. We have an excellent defense industry, which is why we will support it, even if it requires significant funding. That is why this billion is guaranteed; we will continue providing this level of support," Francken emphasized.

"We will try to deliver the F-16s even before the date that was fixed," the top defense official said, without specifying what he meant. The situation with the delivery of the promised F-16 jets remains unclear. The country promised to deliver the first two by the end of 2024. However, this date has been postponed repeatedly due to delays in the delivery of the F-35 jets ordered from the US in 2018.

Belgium only has about 40 F-16s, commissioned in the 1970s, and it promises to transfer them to Kiev as soon as it receives the new jets. It is unclear how many of the F-16s Belgium currently has are operational.

The EU has formally approved its 17th package of sanctions imposed on Russia over aggression in Ukraine, including measures against almost 200 shadow fleet vessels, top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas announced on May 20.

"New measures also address hybrid threats and human rights. More sanctions on Russia are in the works," Kallas said on X.

The step comes as the U.S. signals disinterest in imposing additional sanctions against Russia, even as Moscow refuses Western-backed ceasefire proposals.

The 17th package was supported by EU ambassadors 
 last week, but has since then been criticized as weak and watered down.

The new sanctions target members of Russia's military and political elite and foreign entities in China or the United Arab Emirates, accused of helping the Kremlin evade already-imposed measures.

The EU will also sanction more than 20 entities and individuals disseminating disinformation, and 20 judges and prosecutors involved in legal cases against Russian opposition, specifically Vladimir Kara-Murza and late Alexei Navalny.

The package also targets components vital to Russia's defense industry, namely chemicals, materials, and dual-use goods.

The EU has threatened Russia with additional sanctions unless President Vladimir Putin commits to a ceasefire and agrees to seriously engage in peace efforts. President Volodymyr Zelensky also announced that a new "strong EU sanctions package" is underway.

While European leaders have proclaimed that additional sanctions are coordinated with Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump, who held a phone call with Putin on May 19, said he does not intend to impose new measures on Moscow to avoid disrupting peace efforts.

Trump reportedly also told House Republicans ‘don't fuck around with Medicare'; RFK Jr and Marco Rubio grilled by Senate commitees  

Earlier today, Donald Trump pressed Republicans in Congress to unite behind his sweeping tax-cut bill, but – despite his very optimistic front – apparently failed to convince a handful of holdouts who could still block a package that encompasses much of his domestic agenda.

In a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, Trump bluntly warned Republicans in the House of Representatives not to press for further changes to the sprawling bill, which would cut taxes and tighten eligibility for the Medicaid health program.

He strongly cautioned against further plans to make it more difficult for people to access Medicaid, a program for low-income Americans. One person in the room told Reuters Trump told the holdouts:

Don't fuck around with Medicaid.

He also discouraged Republicans from seeking further carve-outs for state and local tax payments (SALT) - a niche issue that is especially important for moderate Republicans in high-tax states like California and New York.

But Trump failed to convince some lawmakers who are pushing for those provisions.

“The president I don't think convinced enough people that the bill is adequate the way it is,” said Republican representative Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the hard-right House Freedom Caucus and has been pushing for further Medicaid cuts.

Republican representative Mike Lawler, a New York moderate who is pushing to raise limits on deductions for state and local tax payments, likewise said Trump did not change his mind.

As it stands right now, I do not support the bill.

After the meeting, Trump predicted the package would ultimately pass the House, which Republicans control by a narrow majority of 220-213. “It was a meeting of love,” he said. He did not address Harris' concerns.

Freedom Caucus members have been pushing for new work requirements on some Medicaid recipients to kick in earlier than is planned for 2029. But centrists have fought to protect the program, warning that steep cuts could imperil their majority in the 2026 congressional elections.

Trump said afterward the bill would eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse” in Medicaid but would not cause people to lose coverage.

Trump is pressing for every House Republican to vote for the bill, according to a White House official. As he arrived at the Capitol, Trump said Republican lawmakers who vote against it could “possibly” face a primary challenge in next year's congressional elections.

The United States has expressed to the United Arab Emirates and other countries that they are turning the conflict in Sudan into a proxy war, secretary of state Marco Rubio told the Senate foreign relations committee earlier.

Rubio also said that Washington wanted to appoint a special envoy for Sudan but needed to find the right person.

Robert F Kennedy Jr said earlier that the MAHA commission report Donald Trump tasked him producing would come out on Thursday.

Trump signed an executive order to establish a commission to “Make America Healthy Again,” during Kennedy's swearing in ceremony on 13 February and tasked it with investigating chronic illness and delivering an action plan to fight childhood diseases, starting with a report due within 100 days.

“You'll see the report. It's going to be released on Thursday. Everybody will see the report,” Kennedy told the Senate appropriations committee hearing in response to questions about the contents of the report and its impact on agriculture.

Secretary of state Marco Rubio said the US has not discussed the deportation of Palestinians from Gaza to Libya, but he said that Washington had asked other countries in the region if they would be open to accepting people in Gaza who want to move voluntarily.

“What we have talked to some nations about is if someone voluntarily and willingly says I want to go somewhere else for some period of time because I'm sick, because my children need to go to school, or what have you, are there countries in the region willing to accept them for some period of time?,” Rubio said, adding that he was not aware of Libya being included in that.

Rubio also told the Senate foreign relations committee that the United States was pleased to see the resumption of food shipments to Gaza, adding that the US understands that another 100 trucks are behind the initial ones to cross in to Gaza and more might enter in the coming days.

Interior secretary Doug Burgum defended the Trump administration's budget request on Tuesday in a House committee hearing.

Burgum testified before the House Appropriations Committee:

With common sense approaches and modern systems, we can increase returns for our citizens, strengthen our economy, and create great-paying and meaningful jobs – all while protecting our beautiful lands, our abundant wildlife, and our clean air and clean water.

The secretary took some mild heat from lawmakers, facing questions about hiring and funding freezes in the Department of Interior. Republican representative Mark Amodei of Nevada said:

How you can sit there and hold somebody's feet to the fire when there's a whole bunch of empty desks.

Trump has proposed shrinking the Interior Department budget by $5bn, with major cuts to national park management, conservation programming, and other key functions.

Despite the potential steep fall in funding, Burgum has issued an order requiring national park units to remain fully open to visitors.

The planned cuts follow the firing of probationary employees within the department in recent weeks, as well as the resigning of 2,700 workers who accepted Trump's “deferred resignation” offer.

“In just four months, the department has been destabilized, and there's been a stunning decline in its ability to meet its mission,” Democratic representative Chellie Marie Pingree of Maine told Burgum.

Given your extensive executive experience, I'm disappointed that you would allow this to happen.

Secretary of state Marco Rubio has defended the cuts to foreign aid under the gutting of USAID, telling the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee that the US still provides more assistance than the next 10 countries combined.

He also dismissed claims that China was stepping in to replace lost American aid, saying:

China doesn't do foreign aid.

Ukraine, he said, still has Washington's support and Russian president Vladimir Putin has not gained a single thing.

We reported earlier that Donald Trump met with House Republicans on Capitol Hill to unite around his tax and spending cuts proposal.

Speaking to reporters after the closed-door meeting, Trump said he had a “great talk” and that there was “unbelievable unity” in his party. He said:

That was a meeting of love. That was love in that room. There was no shouting.

Elon Musk said he plans to spend “a lot less” on political donations “in the future” after he gave millions towards Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign.

“I think I've done enough,” Musk said during an interview at the Qatar Economic Forum. He added:

If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it. I don't currently see a reason.

Musk spent more than $250m in the last election cycle to elect Trump and other GOP candidates.

Robert F Kennedy Jr defended his management of the ongoing measles outbreak in the US, telling Republican senator Jerry Moran, of Kansas, that he's urging people to get vaccinated against the virus, The Hill reports.

Moran asked Kennedy what the Department of Health and Human Services needed in order to best respond to the outbreak, which has surpassed 1,000 cases. Kennedy said:

The best way to prevent the spread of measles is through vaccination. We urge people to get their MMR vaccines. I spent a lot of time with the Mennonites and the MMR vaccine has millions of fragments of human DNA in it, from aborted fetal tissues, and that's a religious objection for them that I have to respect.

We've done a better job at controlling measles since I came into this agency than any other country in the world. Today, we're at 1,035 cases and we only added 27 cases last week.

As my colleague Jessica Glenza wrote recently, although Kennedy has tepidly endorsed the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to prevent measles, he has also made false and inflammatory claims about the vaccine, including repeating the above false claim that it contains “aborted fetus debris”. The rubella vaccine, like many others, is produced using decades-old sterile fetal cell lines derived from two elective terminations in the 1960s.

The US is enduring the largest measles outbreak in a quarter-century. Centered in west Texas, the measles outbreak has killed two unvaccinated children and one adult and spread to neighboring states including New Mexico and Oklahoma.

The US eliminated measles in 2000. Elimination status would be lost if the US had 12 months of sustained transmission of the virus. As of 1 May, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 935 confirmed measles cases across 30 jurisdictions. Nearly one in three children under five years old involved in the outbreak, or 285 young children, have been hospitalized.

Donald Trump said he was weighing what actions to take after the European Union and Britain moved ahead with major new Russia sanctions, but he gave no further detail.

“We're looking at a lot of things, but we'll see,” Trump told reporters as he left Capitol Hill following a meeting with fellow Republicans about their tax bill.

The UK and Europe earlier announced major sanctions against Russia as it became clear that yesterday's call between Trump and Vladimir Putin had failed to deliver any meaningful concessions from Moscow.

The UK said its sanctions would target dozens of entities “supporting Russia's military machine, energy exports and information war, as well as financial institutions helping to fund Putin's invasion of Ukraine”.

Shortly after the EU approved sanctions targeting Russia's shadow fleet of about 200 vessels and said that more sanctions were in the pipeline.

Here is the moment Marco Rubio's Senate hearing was disrupted briefly by a pro-Palestine protester.

The Trump administration is working to reach an agreement that would allow Iran to have a civil nuclear energy program but not enrich uranium, secretary of state Marco Rubio said, but admitted that achieving such a deal “will not be easy.”

He told the Senate foreign relations committee that the administration was offering an “off-ramp” for Iran to pursue prosperity and peace.

It will not be easy, but that's the process we're engaged in now.

Secretary of state Marco Rubio told the Senate foreign relations committee that the Syrian transitional authority may be weeks away from potential collapse and full-scale civil war, defending Donald Trump's decision to lift Syria sanctions and to engage with the interim government in Damascus.

It is our assessment that, frankly, the transitional authority, given the challenges they're facing, are maybe weeks, not many months, away from potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions, basically the country splitting up.

Signing off on the final routine medical examination of Joe Biden's presidency, physician Kevin O'Connor declared the former US president to be a “healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male”.

But the diagnosis of an aggressive form of prostate cancer, said only to have been discovered last week, has raised questions over the transparency of White House physicians and their personal loyalty to the presidents they serve.

It is unclear whether the former president was screened for prostate cancer during his presidency and health bodies have warned that PSA testing is often unreliable.

As with all presidents, the responsibility of their medical care lies with the White House physician, who serves as the personal doctor to the leader of the free world.

They run a military-like operation providing round-the-clock medical care to the president, often accompanying them on Air Force One during domestic and international trips.

Among their biggest jobs is to perform an annual physical exam performed at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre to determine if the president is fit for office.

Stringent and thorough, they test everything from the president's general health, to their neurological and cognitive ability.

For decades, the White House has publicly released the results of the president's annual physical, listing their medications and other basic details about their health status.

But administrations have great discretion over what to include in the releases, given that there is no federal law requiring US presidents to release their health records.

In turn, some reports have faced questions over their accuracy.

At the centre of Mr Biden's medical care is Dr O'Connor, who has had a close relationship with the Biden family that dates back to 2009.

The man Mr Biden simply calls “Doc” treated Mr Biden's mother after she fell ill while recovering from hip surgery. Years later, he is said to have consulted with Mr Biden's niece about an eye problem.

His relationship with Mr Biden grew as he shadowed the medical team involved in the treatment of his son Beau's brain cancer.

As Beau's condition worsened, Dr O'Connor was the family's “eyes and ears” at the hospital, according to the memoir Promise me Dad.

He would go on to become a voice of reason for the former president. When Mr Biden developed a fever ahead of trip to Central America, he described in his memoir how Dr O'Connor urged him not to travel and to rest instead.

“Right now, you look like s---. I can't make you not look like s---,” Mr Biden recounted. He ultimately took this advice.

He was initially contracted to be Mr Biden's physician for just six months when the Obama administration began in 2009.

“That didn't work out and, so, I ended up doing the whole eight years with him,” Dr O'Connor joked in an interview last year with the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine about his role as the president's chief physician.

Mr Biden brought Dr O'Connor back to the White House when he became president in 2021.

“I retired and had a plan, and here I am again,” Dr O'Connor, who grew up in New Jersey, said at the time.

Outside of the White House, Dr O'Connor is said to have worked closely with James Biden, the president's brother, at a company that operated rural hospitals.

The stocky former army surgeon was always close to his number one patient, ready to provide care as needed though few outside the building would know who he is.

But Mr Biden's politically crippling debate performance changed all that. It was he, just four months before the disastrous debate that unfolded in front of that world, who had overseen Mr Biden's most recent physical exam in 2024 insisting the president at the time “continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations”.

Since then, a new book based on the accounts of White House insiders, Original Sin, claimed that aides shielded the public from the extent of Mr Biden's decline.

Donald Trump questioned the medical assessments carried out by Dr O'Connor during a press conference in the Oval Office on Monday evening.

He said: “I think that if you take a look, it's the same doctor that said that Joe was cognitively fine. ‘There was nothing wrong with him'. If it's the same doctor, he said, there was nothing wrong there, and that's being proven to be a sad situation.”

“And I think somebody is going to have to speak to his doctor if it's the same or even if it's two separate doctors. Why wasn't the cognitive ability? Why wasn't that discussed? And I think the doctor said ‘he's just fine', and it's turned out that's not so, it's very dangerous,” he added.

Dr Zeke Emanuel, vice provost for global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania told The Telegraph: “We have a long history of where the illnesses of presidents have been hidden from the public.

“​​We need an independent group of doctors, three doctors, not chosen by the president and not politicised.”

            Until last week, a secretive fleet of ships ferrying Russian oil around the world showed no clear links to the Kremlin. That changed when, in a dramatic escalation, Russia used a fighter jet in an apparent effort to protect one of the tankers thought to be in the fleet.
    


            After the Estonian military contacted the Jaguar – an unflagged tanker sanctioned by the United Kingdom earlier this month – on May 13 in an attempt to carry out checks, a Russian Su-35 fighter jet flew past the ship, inside Estonian airspace, the Estonian Defense Forces said. The military eventually escorted the tanker out of Estonian waters.
    


            “This is something very new,” Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told reporters Thursday at a NATO meeting in Turkey. Russia has now “officially tied and connected itself” to the so-called shadow fleet, he added.
    


            Others agree. “This seems to be a step-change in Kremlin thinking,” Ed Arnold, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a UK-based think tank, told CNN.

Europe's undersea infrastructure keeps getting damaged. What's going on?



            Estimated to be hundreds of vessels strong, with no official ties to Russia, the “shadow fleet” includes many old, poorly maintained ships, which have in some instances wreaked environmental havoc and, according to some, have been implicated in damage to vital undersea cables off the Baltic coast. Russia has denied any role in the damage.
    


            The tankers, many with opaque ownership structures, transport Russian oil for export to avoid Western sanctions. As such, they have themselves become a focus of further sanctions on Moscow.
    


            Russia's use, for the first time, of “military action” in response to economic sanctions “is a testament to the level of the threat that we're facing on the eastern flank of NATO,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told journalists at the meeting in Turkey.
    


            Video shot from the bridge of the Jaguar, which appears to have been edited, shows a radio call from Estonian authorities demanding the ship change course, with Estonian military ships and aircraft visible around the tanker. CNN has corroborated details of the footage, which was shared online by Margarita Simonyan, editor in chief of Russian state media outlet RT.
    


            Later in the video, a sole Russian Su-35 fighter jet sweeps ahead of the tanker, which was previously named the Argent, according to shipping records and the UK government. In response, Portuguese F-16 jets on a NATO mission in Estonia were rushed to the area to monitor the Russian aircraft, NATO said.
    


            The jets are part of a strengthened NATO presence in northern Europe since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
    


            “Probably what the Kremlin is trying to do is push back on that, so in the hope that NATO nations get spooked by what happened (last Tuesday),” said Arnold at RUSI.
    


            “There will be those within NATO who are a bit worried about this and say, ‘Well, hang on, do we really want to risk starting a wider confrontation with Russia over one ship?'”
    


            For the Estonians, the Russian jet's intrusion into Estonian air space is proof that Western sanctions are biting.
    


            The incident “demonstrates that monitoring and sanctioning the shadow fleet is effective and that such efforts must be further intensified,” the Estonian Defense Forces said in a statement.

            CNN was not able to locate the registered owner of the Jaguar for comment. The Russian Ministry of Defense has declined to respond to CNN's request for comment. The Kremlin has previously refused to respond to accusations that it uses a “shadow fleet.”
    


            In January, following repeated incidents in which ships caused damage to undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea, NATO launched the “Baltic Sentry” initiative to bolster its military presence in the waters.
    


            “We see the (Tuesday) incident as a reaction to Baltic Sentry,” Col. Martin O'Donnell, a NATO spokesman, told CNN. “Russia's destabilizing actions will not deter us from acting within international law to maintain maritime security, safety and freedom of navigation.”
    


            German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday that a new sanctions package could be adopted as early as Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to join Russia's talks with Ukraine in Turkey last week. Merz had said earlier that Russia's “shadow fleet” – “permanently operating in the Baltic Sea with up to 300 ships” – would be specifically targeted in this package.
    


            In a possible tit-for-tat move, a Greek-owned oil tanker, Green Admire, was detained Sunday by Russia as it transited Russian waters on a route agreed by Estonia, Finland and Russia, Estonia's foreign minister posted on X.
    


            CNN has reached out to the vessel's owner and the Russian foreign ministry for comment. The Russian foreign ministry has not responded.
    


            Estonian authorities have conducted more than 450 checks on vessels in Tallinn-controlled waters in the Baltic Sea since last June, according to the country's transport ministry. This includes the Gulf of Finland, one of the principal conduits for Russian overseas trade.

Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) has been charged by the Department of Justice (DOJ) with assaulting law enforcement during a scuffle that occurred outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in New Jersey, U.S. Attorney Alina Habba said on May 19.

Habba said that McIver's conduct “cannot be overlooked” by the chief federal law enforcement authority in New Jersey, adding that the charges were filed after efforts to address the matter were unsuccessful.

“I have persistently made efforts to address these issues without bringing criminal charges and have given Representative McIver every opportunity to come to a resolution, but she has unfortunately declined,” the U.S. attorney stated. “No one is above the law—politicians or otherwise.”

McIver alleged that it was ICE agents who created “an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation” during the arrest of the mayor.

“The charges against me are purely political—they mischaracterize and distort my actions, and are meant to criminalize and deter legislative oversight,” she stated. “This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right.”

“As to Delaney Hall, I will continue to advocate for the humane treatment of detainees, and I will continue to press the facility to ensure that it is compliant with City of Newark codes and regulations,” he stated. “I want to be clear: I stand with LaMonica, and I fully expect her to be vindicated.”

The Trump administration opened Delaney Hall as a detention facility for illegal immigrants on May 1 as part of its broader crackdown on illegal immigration nationwide. The move has triggered protests by illegal immigrant advocates and some Democratic politicians in recent weeks, including Baraka, a gubernatorial candidate.

Delaney Hall is a 1,000-bed facility along an industrial stretch of Newark Bay, according to the private prison company that operates the center. Baraka has said that the facility lacks the proper city permits in order to open, including a certificate of occupancy.

“This is an issue of human rights, an issue of due process, an issue of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States,” Baraka told reporters earlier this month. “We are afraid and opposed and alarmed by them setting up a detention center.”

GEO Group, which runs Delaney Hall, has accused the mayor of politicizing the situation and said that city officials didn't object when the Obama administration operated the facility as an ICE processing center.

The Epoch Times has reached out to GEO Group for further comment and did not receive a response by publication time.

Statehood is a precious commodity. After a burst of creation following the Soviet Union's collapse, only three new countries have been recognized in the last 30 years—East Timor, in 2002, Montenegro, in 2006, and South Sudan, in 2011. There have been plenty of other attempts in that interval. But most have been stymied by the principle of territorial integrity, which prioritizes fixed borders even in cases of state failure and makes the path to legal independence long and uncertain.

But in the last few years, this norm has grown weaker. In February 2022, Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine designed to wipe the country off the map. Initially met with shock and horror, the idea of the Russian conquest of Ukraine has since been normalized by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called for letting Moscow keep some of this land. Trump has also threatened to annex Canada, as well as Greenland, which is an autonomous region of Denmark. Just how serious he is remains to be seen. But the upshot is clear: the United States, the most powerful country in the world, no longer views territorial integrity as an important element of the global order.

For some secessionist groups, this is certainly good news. Independence movements no longer must prove that their cause is just or essential. Instead, they may simply need to align with powerful countries, especially in strategically important areas. Trump's preference for personal diplomacy could also help separatists, provided that they have charismatic leaders who can sidestep cumbersome institutional diplomacy and court the American president himself.

Yet Trump's rejection of international norms is a double-edged sword. These norms constrain separatists and deter governmental repression. They also give secessionists a way to make their claims. Independence movements typically justify their existence using the language of human rights and self-determination, which Trump disregards. Rather, this U.S. president favors strong, brutal rulers over fledgling upstarts. He has aligned himself with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who have used killings and other kinds of violence to suppress Kurdish and Chechen secessionists, respectively. Trump does not care about impoverished separatists if they cannot provide him with immediate rewards.

For independence movements, the era of Trump is thus one of both opportunity and danger. There are both fewer restraints and fewer protections. For groups he sees as strategically useful (or favors for some other reason), the path to statehood will become more straightforward. But for those that Trump sees as strategically useless, he will either change nothing or make life more difficult. In a system in which recognition depends on leverage rather than law, more movements could try their luck at gaining independence. But without consistent norms or protections, success will remain rare and failure will become more dangerous. More breakaway regions may receive some form of recognition, but it would be weak and partial—contingent on whether their leaders can keep aiding more powerful states. And the world as a whole will experience more bloodshed, as both governments and separatists, unencumbered by global sanctions or normative restrictions, become more assertive.

Trump is hardly the first modern American president to ignore norms governing territorial integrity when they become inconvenient. But Trump is the first in decades to disregard the idea altogether. Ukrainians “may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday,” Trump said in February. He has repeatedly called the U.S.-Canadian border an “artificially drawn line.”

These remarks are bad news for the people of Ukraine and Canada, who have made it clear that they do not want to join Russia or the United States, respectively. But if Trump's realpolitik approach takes hold, secessionist entities might find it easier to gain legitimacy by aligning with the United States or other great powers. Movements in valuable locations, such as Kurdish separatists in oil-rich Iraq or the leadership of Somaliland (which is already functionally independent, and located in the geographically important Horn of Africa), might secure U.S. recognition and support if they advance Washington's aims. Separatists in Greenland who seek independence from Denmark, or in New Caledonia who seek independence from France, could garner support from the United States or another great power if they can promise trade routes, military bases, or access to their resources.

In Trump's world, secessionists may also be able to succeed—or at least gain traction—through diplomacy. Typically, separatists are disadvantaged in talks because they are cut off from the kinds of formal institutional channels through which diplomacy normally flows. But Trump routinely disregards this standard operating procedure. Instead, he prefers personal diplomacy, such as his 2018 discussions with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. That means that charismatic separatist leaders could curry favor with the U.S. president by appealing to him directly.



Trump's world, however, will hardly guarantee more success for secessionists. The president has loosened constraints on independence movements, but his preference for strongmen and centralized control creates new obstacles. Trump tends to favor aggressive national leaders who project power, not upstart rebels or subnational challengers. This makes him more likely to support existing regimes over separatist fragments—as long as the regime supports him. During Trump's first term, for example, Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Biafra separatist movement in Nigeria, issued a personal plea to the U.S. president, citing Trump's support for Brexit as proof of his belief in self-determination. Yet there is no evidence that Trump responded, either publicly or privately, to Kanu's appeals. The U.S. government treated Biafra, which is of little strategic value to the United States, as an internal Nigerian matter, as it had for decades.

Biafra is hardly alone. Despite rhetorical nods to sovereignty, the Trump administration has showed little interest in backing most independence movements, like those of the Kurds, throughout the Middle East, or the Catalans, in Spain. In October 2019, Trump even ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria, effectively abandoning the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and allowing Turkey to launch a military operation against them. The move drew bipartisan criticism as a destabilizing betrayal of a reliable partner, and Trump ultimately agreed to keep U.S. troops in Syria (where they remain). But it still showed Trump's willingness to prioritize regional power politics over friendly secessionists.

More generally, Trump's geopolitical vision favors stable spheres of influence, where great powers set the rules. A world of breakaway regions undermines the principle of control that undergirds this Mafia-style view of order. So do the standard pro-secession arguments, which are couched in the language of human rights, minority rights, historic injustice, and self-determination. Trump, in other words, may tolerate secession if it serves a purpose. But he is unlikely to encourage it as a principle.

Because Trump's order has mixed consequences for separatists, it will not yield a single outcome for their movements. Instead, it will reconfigure the terrain on which they operate. Secession will become a geopolitical transaction, not a legal or moral claim.

This change, however, will have some predictable results. The few successful secessionist movements of the last three decades were largely the result of ethical claims, as well as intensive organization. But now separatist success will largely depend on whether the movement serves the interests of a dominant power, not on its legitimacy or efficacy. Secessionism, in turn, could cease to function as a tool of imperial resistance and instead become a tool of empire itself—a means for great powers to project influence or engage in proxy conflict (as Russia has already done by propping up breakaway regions in Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine).

As independence movements sense new openings in a weakened international order, there may still be an uptick in separatist attempts. But that hardly means that there will be more successes. Recognition will remain rare, both because great-power interests often conflict and because home states—less constrained by norms or economic restrictions—will be empowered to crush separatist uprisings before they gain ground. Instead of new full-blown states, partial recognition cases, such as Kosovo, Northern Cyprus, Palestine, and Western Sahara, might become more common. Such recognition, for example, could soon extend to Catalonia, Iraqi Kurdistan, Somaliland, and breakaway parts of Libya and Syria. For places that are already functionally independent, a transactional global order might open new diplomatic venues or economic channels that bring them closer to official recognition—provided, of course, that they can offer strategic value such as basing rights or resource access. For regions that lack de facto independence, success will now hinge even less on legal or moral claims.

In this newly contingent and chaotic world, separatist-related violence will also become more frequent. In part, that will simply be the product of renewed separatist attempts. But breakaway regions could also launch more violent attacks, encouraged by their newfound patrons and the diminished consequences of breaking international law. Incumbents, likewise, will feel more empowered to use violence to quash independence movements. The global institutions that traditionally restrain both secessionist overreach and heavy-handed repression are losing their power to constrain either. The EU once played a central role in restraining violence between Serbia and Kosovo, for example, using accession talks as leverage to encourage cooperation. The UN helped limit violence in East Timor and South Sudan by providing peacekeeping forces. But ultimately, these institutions derive their power from the support of member countries, which is weakening. Trump, for his part, has repeatedly attacked both bodies and cut U.S. funding for the UN's peacekeeping missions.

For independence movements, the new rules of secession mean a more volatile and uncertain future. If success depends on timing, charisma, and strategic utility, some breakaway regions may have a shortcut to recognition. Others might suffer. All of them, however, will have to navigate a landscape where sovereignty is not earned but cynically auctioned off.

As tensions rise across the Taiwan Strait, the policy debate in Washington remains fractured. U.S. strategy broadly revolves around deterring China from attacking Taiwan, and for the past three presidential administrations, it has consisted of three central components: increasing the ability of the United States and Taiwan to defend the island militarily; using diplomacy to signal U.S. resolve to protect Taiwan while also reassuring China that Washington does not support Taiwanese independence; and using economic pressure to slow China's military modernization efforts.

But there is little consensus on the right balance among these three components—and that balance determines to some degree how deterrence looks in practice. Some contend that diplomatic pressure—along with military restraint, to avoid antagonizing China—will keep Beijing at bay. Others warn that unless Washington significantly strengthens its military posture in Asia, deterrence will collapse. And a third approach, outlined recently in Foreign Affairs by Jennifer Kavanagh and Stephen Wertheim, emphasizes that bolstering Taiwan's self-defense and enabling offshore U.S. support is the best route to sustaining deterrence while also mitigating the risk of escalation.These prescriptions have merit but fall short of grappling with the paradox at the heart of U.S. strategy: deterrence can fail in two ways. Do too little, and Beijing may gamble it can seize Taiwan before Washington is able to respond. Do too much, and Chinese leaders may conclude that force is the only remaining path to unification. Navigating this dilemma requires more than a stronger military or bolder diplomacy. It requires a calibrated strategy of rearmament, reassurance, and restraint that threads the needle between weakness and recklessness. Combined properly, forward-deployed capabilities, diplomatic restraint, and selective economic interdependence can reinforce one another to maintain credible deterrence while avoiding provocation.

So far, however, the Trump administration's approach to Taiwan has veered between harsh transactionalism, such as the imposition of a 32 percent tariff on most Taiwanese goods last month, and quiet reaffirmations of support for Taipei through bipartisan visits and a pause on the highest tariffs. The administration still has time to settle on a coherent strategy, but the window of opportunity is closing.

Currently, the U.S. military is improving its force posture in the vicinity of Taiwan, most notably through expanded access to bases in the Philippines and by reinforcing capabilities in southwestern Japan and the broader western Pacific. In the Philippines, thanks to the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, the United States gained access to four new strategic sites, bringing the total there to nine. Several, such as those in Cagayan and Isabela Provinces, are just a few hundred miles from Taiwan.

The story is similar in Japan's case. Washington and Tokyo agreed in 2023 to restructure the U.S. Marine Corps presence in Okinawa from the artillery-focused 12th Marine Regiment, part of a force of roughly 18,000 marines stationed in Japan, into a 2,000-strong Marine Littoral Regiment, a quick-reaction force designed to operate along the so-called first island chain encompassing Indonesia, Japan, portions of the Philippines, and Taiwan. To complement this effort, the U.S. military has increased joint military exercises and expanded integrated air and missile defense systems across allied territories.

But U.S. military capabilities in the Pacific need more than just quantitative upgrades; they require qualitative shifts to be able to block China from forcibly unifying with Taiwan. The United States needs a greater forward presence in the region, as well as specific capabilities that would prevent an invading force from making its way across the Taiwan Strait, such as strategic bombers, submarines, and antiship missiles. Once those were deployed, they would also require significant operational flexibility. For example, Washington should prioritize securing forward-deployed submarine tenders in Japan and the Philippines to enable submarines to reload, resupply, and rearm without returning to Guam or Hawaii. And it should work to establish permanent bomber bases in Australia and the Philippines and deploy antiship missile systems in Japan's southwestern islands and the northern Philippines.



So far, the U.S. military has stopped short of seeking such changes because they are politically sensitive both at home and abroad: host countries worry they might become greater targets of Chinese aggression, and some U.S. policymakers worry that such moves could cross a redline for Beijing. But if Washington follows a few principles, such improvements will not necessarily provoke Chinese aggression. First, the United States should not make a public announcement or a spectacle of enhancements to its military force posture. As U.S. forces increase their activities around and in Taiwan, be they joint exercises, freedom of navigation exercises, or training, U.S. officials should refrain from making statements to which China might feel forced to respond. Military upgrades should be concealed or downplayed until they are fielded to minimize the likelihood that China will effectively launch a coercive campaign against their deployment.

Bolstering Taiwan's independent military capabilities—a long-standing U.S. policy—presents an arguably even bigger risk of provocation. Beijing worries that Taiwan will become so certain of its ability to protect itself that it will consider declaring independence. In recent years, Taiwan has acquired defense capabilities with the aim of deterring potential Chinese aggression. It has bought asymmetric warfare systems, such as coastal defense cruise missiles and HIMARS rocket systems, moving away from traditional high-cost platforms such as submarines. It has also pledged that its defense budget will exceed three percent of GDP in 2025 and that it will prioritize precision-guided munitions, air defense upgrades, command-and-control systems, equipment for reserve forces, and anti-drone technologies. These are sensible steps, but they also pose a risk: the less Taiwan depends on U.S. assistance, the more China's leaders worry that Taiwan's president, Lai Ching-te, could be emboldened to declare independence unilaterally—further incentivizing Beijing to invade sooner rather than later.

To prevent deterrence from morphing into provocation, the United States should provide Taiwan mainly with capabilities that rely on continued U.S. support. In 2024, for example, the Biden administration approved the sale of three National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems to Taiwan in a deal that was brokered to increase U.S.-Taiwanese interoperability. In other words, this system was designed to function best in tandem with U.S. support. The United States should continue to encourage Taiwan's asymmetric defense, particularly by prioritizing the speedy and reliable delivery of systems such as the highly mobile precision HIMARS rockets; advanced air defense missile systems such as the NASAMS; and antiship missiles such as the RGM-84L-4 Block II Harpoon. But Washington should also highlight the aspects of Taiwan's military capacity that are linked to the United States, reassuring Beijing that the island cannot act alone.

Reassuring Beijing is a critical component of a successful deterrence strategy. But during both the Trump and the Biden administrations, the United States has relaxed its longstanding policy of “strategic ambiguity,” wherein U.S. policy has avoided defining whether and under what circumstances Washington would intervene to defend Taiwan. Instead, the United States has been signaling to China its determination to defend Taiwan—especially by making incremental moves toward establishing formal diplomatic relations with the island, such as direct interactions between American and Taiwanese officials.

Joe Biden was the first U.S. president to invite Taiwan's diplomatic representatives to attend his inauguration, for example, and he repeatedly referred to a U.S. “commitment” to Taiwan's defense, even saying once that U.S. forces would defend the island in the event of an “unprecedented attack.” (White House officials stated at the time that there was no change to the official policy of “strategic ambiguity.”) Officials in the second Trump administration, including Mike Waltz before he was ousted as national security adviser, have advocated ending strategic ambiguity and moving toward “strategic clarity.” And in February, the State Department removed a statement about not supporting Taiwan's independence from its website—a deletion that China interpreted as provocative.

Although they may seem merely symbolic, such diplomatic slights have real consequences, making it harder for Beijing to maintain a veneer of progress toward unification of the mainland with Taiwan. Chinese leaders see any drift toward Taiwanese independence as a threat to their legitimacy. So, far from deterring Beijing, U.S. provocations—official diplomatic interactions, references to Taiwan as a country, calls for a U.S.-Taiwanese alliance—could incentivize Beijing to undertake a cross-strait invasion.

Reassurance that Washington does not support Taiwanese independence should include public criticism when Taiwan's leaders make statements or take actions that suggest otherwise. For example, in December 2003, President George W. Bush publicly rebuked Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian during a joint press conference with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, stating that the United States opposed any “unilateral decision by either China or Taiwan to change the status quo,” noting that Chen's “comments and actions” had indicated “that he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally to change” it. In 2006, after Chen angered Beijing by scrapping a government council that had been established to guide unification with China, the Bush administration once again signaled its disapproval, denying the Taiwanese leader's request for a high-profile U.S. stopover during a presidential trip to Latin America. These sorts of reassurances helped convince Chinese leaders that future “peaceful reunification” remained possible, reducing the likelihood of an invasion.

The United States should also keep trying to build a multilateral consensus for peace in the Taiwan Strait. For instance, joint statements issued at the G-7 summit last month and at the Munich Security Conference in February reaffirmed cross-strait stability and expressed opposition to any unilateral actions that threaten peace in the Taiwan Strait, including through force or coercion. Washington should pair these diplomatic signals with a clear reaffirmation that its “one China” policy remains in place, that any resolution must be nonviolent, and that the United States is not against peaceful unification with Taiwan's assent.

These changes to military capabilities and to U.S. diplomacy are easy compared with what is required in the third area of U.S. deterrence strategy: economic pressure. Economic pressure can undermine deterrence and reassurance alike. Since the first Trump administration, the United States has pursued an economic containment strategy to slow China's long-term growth and deny it advanced technologies, with the aim of hampering its capacity to match U.S. military investments. This began with the first Trump administration's tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of Chinese goods. The Biden administration not only kept these tariffs in place but also added export controls on strategically important technologies, such as semiconductors and telecommunications. The United States also pressured American companies to shift their supply chains and manufacturing operations away from China.

The second Trump administration has threatened to accelerate an economic decoupling from China with even wider-ranging, unconditional tariffs, although the prospect of financial pain for the United States seems to have given it pause for now. Nonetheless, these policies portend lasting damage to the Chinese economy, especially in view of China's looming demographic and environmental challenges. For Washington, the hope remains that Beijing may be unable to keep pace militarily as its relative growth rate slows.

But the ongoing U.S.-Chinese trade war and escalating American export and investment restrictions have deepened Beijing's mistrust and reinforced its claim that Washington seeks containment rather than peaceful coexistence. This economic pressure not only risks hardening China's resolve but also enables Beijing to recast itself as a defender of global trade norms and to shift blame for any global economic slowdown to the United States. At the same time, the United States risks forfeiting its long-term leverage, as the tariffs may goad Beijing to deepen its commitment to what the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) calls “domestic demand expansion,” or selling more products at home instead of exporting them. Such a shift in China's economy would encourage domestic production and innovation and accelerate efforts to reduce reliance on foreign markets.

This U.S. strategy will also have limited effects on China's long-term military prowess. China has pursued military modernization at historically low costs, avoiding the classic “guns or butter” dilemma. China has not matched U.S. defense spending dollar for dollar, as challengers did in earlier great-power rivalries. Nazi Germany, for instance, spent twice as much on its military as the United Kingdom did between 1933 and 1939. And during the Cold War, the U.S. and Soviet defense budgets signaled direct competition: the United States spent an average of 32 percent more than the Soviet Union until 1970, when the Soviet Union took the lead, outspending the U.S. by an average of 26 percent until 1988. In contrast, China has made targeted investments intended to give it an advantage in a quick, limited war, while keeping its overall defense spending relatively modest: Beijing's defense spending has risen from five percent of U.S. levels in 1995 to 32 percent in 2017. In this way, China has sustained both economic development and military modernization, but avoided a Cold War­–style arms race. China will therefore be able to continue its military modernization program even with a stagnant economy, especially if it increases its military spending as a share of GDP.



Indeed, instead of hampering China's military, the trade war could make a shooting war seem more appealing to Beijing. Currently Chinese leaders would consider an invasion of Taiwan only in a specific, narrow scenario: if China could take the island before U.S. forces could intervene. For Beijing, a larger-scale, protracted war would be too costly. This is partly because of the economic value of the U.S.-Chinese relationship. But if U.S. economic pressure increases, Chinese leaders could conclude that the benefits of continued economic engagement are low and that conflict with the United States is the only way to get out from under the American thumb. This would make them more willing to risk war over Taiwan.

Concrete economic and diplomatic concessions that increase China's benefits from maintaining the status quo and credibly convey benign U.S. intent would be effective reassurances. Pausing or reversing the economic decoupling is an obvious place to start; Washington should rescind tariffs on Chinese imports (or at least make them conditional on reasonable Chinese reciprocation) and relax its restrictions on exports and on incoming investment in all but the most sensitive technologies and sectors. This would not only quell Beijing's perception that the United States seeks to weaken and “split” China but also allay any brewing domestic instability that could threaten the CCP's legitimacy and encourage Chinese leaders to forcibly take Taiwan to boost nationalist legitimacy. Perhaps most important, sustaining economic interdependence, especially the asymmetric sort that currently exists, gives the United States enormous leverage over China by allowing it to threaten heavier sanctions in the event of war. Unilateral U.S. sanctions could set the Chinese economy on a path of permanent decline. Pausing or circumscribing an economic decoupling would give U.S. sanctions maximum bite and bolster deterrence.

Of course, bolstering economic interdependence also requires limiting U.S. reliance on key Chinese imports, such as rare-earth minerals, transformers for the electric grid, scarce medicines, high-tech electronics, and other industrial, infrastructural, and military inputs. The United States should diversify its sources for these imports and reduce the proportion that China provides to acceptable levels. But Washington does not need to immediately reduce imports of Chinese consumer goods, even though substitutes can be found relatively easily. Allowing such imports to continue would enable the United States to avoid destabilizing China while retaining the threat of painful sanctions. Finally, to maximize its deterrent leverage against China, Washington should coordinate a sanctions coalition with allies, which may require offering them subsidies or other concessions.

For many in Washington, deterrence has come to mean projecting an uncompromising and even hostile posture toward China. But such gestures do not meaningfully augment Taiwan's security. Instead, the United States should invest quietly in its military readiness and capabilities, speak carefully, and maintain economic resilience and even some interdependence. The dilemma of deterrence—the fact that it can so easily slide into provocation or procrastination—necessitates such a tightrope approach. And if there's one place where striking the right balance could pay enormous dividends, it's Taiwan.

One of President Donald Trump's main campaign promises for a second term was the mass deportation of millions who came into the country illegally during the Biden administration.

If a person who has been deported reenters the country illegally, that's a felony under Title 8 law, said Ciaran McEvoy, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles.

“Even if they want to turn them over, they can't,” McEvoy told The Epoch Times.

Operation Guardian Angel gets around the law through federal arrest warrants, which McEvoy said leave the counties no choice but to hand the targeted illegal immigrants over.

Essayli stated in the press release that “the worst criminal aliens in state custody are frequently released into the community” because California's sanctuary state policies block cooperation with federal law enforcement.

“These laws effectively render federal immigration detainers meaningless. The days of giving criminal illegal aliens a free pass are over,” he stated. “While California may be presently disregarding detainers, it cannot ignore federal arrest warrants.”

The program, which began May 10, has resulted in the arrest of 13 defendants as of May 15 in California. The Operation Guardian Angel task force is made up of ICE, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Homeland Security Investigations, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

The California federal district is home to the counties of Riverside, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles County. An estimated 1.5 million illegal immigrants reside in the district, including gang members, the press release said, adding that California's protection of criminal illegal aliens makes residents less safe.

The release noted that in February 2025, José Cristian Saravia-Sánchez, 30, of Mexico, shot and killed an Inglewood man who tried to stop him from stealing a catalytic converter, which garnered national attention.

He was an illegal immigrant who had been convicted of vehicle theft, removed from the United States in 2013, and arrested 11 times between June 2022 and August 2024, according to the release. However, local law enforcement was prevented by state law from complying with an immigration detainer request, the release stated.

The office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Epoch Times by publication time.

            • Battle over Trump's agenda: President Donald Trump expressed confidence after meeting with House Republicans on Capitol Hill this morning as he made a personal pitch for passing his sweeping tax and spending cuts bill.  Trump urged House Republicans to stop negotiating and move ahead with the bill and warned them to stay away from changes to Medicaid, sources in the meeting told CNN, as GOP holdouts threaten to stall his agenda.
    


            • Heated hearings: Several Cabinet secretaries — including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — defended their policies in hearings on the Hill today. Kennedy and a top Democrat sparred over HHS cuts, including their impact on a National Institutes of Health cancer trial.
    


            • Ukraine war talks: Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that threatening Russia with additional sanctions could cause Moscow to stop talking about a potential end to the war in Ukraine. His remarks come a day after Trump's call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            A new “special review panel” will conduct another review of the 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan, US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced today.
    


                    “Over the last three months, the Department has been engaged in a review of this catastrophic event in our military's history,” Hegseth said in a memo, which he posted to X. “I have concluded that we need to conduct a comprehensive review to ensure that accountability for this event is met and that the complete picture is provided to the American people.”
                





            Hegseth, who has repeatedly vowed accountability for the Afghanistan withdrawal, said he was appointing Sean Parnell, the assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs and Hegseth's senior adviser, to lead the review panel. The panel will “thoroughly examine previous investigations,” Hegseth's memo said.
    


More background: There have not been public senior-level firings over how the withdrawal was carried out, though the withdrawal has been the subject of multiple other reviews and investigations.
    


            An investigation conducted by the US military into the ISIS bombing at Abbey Gate at the Hamid Karzai International Airport, which left 13 US troops and 170 civilians dead, was released in February 2022. More than 100 people were interviewed in the investigation.
    


            An administration-wide after-action review of the withdrawal was released in April 2023, and the State Department released their own damning after-action report in June 2023. The US military conducted an additional review of the Abbey Gate bombing, the results of which were released in 2024.
    


            Conservatives left the House Republican conference meeting with President Donald Trump with different outlooks on the sweeping bill to enact the president's agenda.
    


            Some remained skeptical or outright against the bill but others, however, agreed with Trump it's time for the party to put down their pens and vote for the bill.
    


Here's what some of them said:



            A Senate Appropriations hearing on Tuesday broke into a tense exchange about health funding cuts and their impact on disease research.
    


            US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accused the committee's top Democrat of standing by as chronic disease spiked in the country after Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, asked who made the decision to fire or push out thousands of workers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
    


            Then they discussed cancer patient Natalie Phelps' case.
    


What to know about Phelps' case: Natalie Phelps has stage IV colorectal cancer and she has expressed concerns that her treatment will be delayed after NIH staffing cuts. Phelps told CNN that some of the scientists working on the trial had been eliminated in HHS cuts, which could slow the availability of her treatment once it was being created.
    


            The senator and health secretary argued about Phelps' eligibility for the program. CNN previously reported that Phelps was accepted into the trial last month, but her tumor needed to grow before she could begin treatment.
    


            Capito, the subcommittee's top Republican, also expressed apprehension about NIH funding cuts.
    


            “I'm concerned that our science, our country, is falling behind in my biomedical research,” she said at the start of the hearing, adding that NIH-funded basic research is behind buprenorphine and naloxone nasal spray, which are used to combat the opioid epidemic, new Alzheimer's drugs and hundreds of novel cancer treatments.
    


            While she acknowledged that “wasteful spending of taxpayers dollars must end, she also urged that the funding appropriated by Congress for fiscal year 2025 should be “spent in a timely manner, in particular for the vital biomedical research which could lead to life saving breakthroughs in science.”
    


            HHS layoffs and grant terminations have resulted in at least $1.8 billion in cut NIH spending this year, according to some estimates. The Trump administration's proposed budget for 2026 would slash $18 billion from the NIH's total budget.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio faced the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier today for the first time since his confirmation hearing and he defended his overhaul of the State Department amid a proposed rescission of $20 billion in funding.
    


            He is now testifying before the Senate Appropriations Committee and is expected to testify before House committees over the next days as well.
    


Here's what else Rubio has told the Senate committees so far :



This post has been updated with Rubio's testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee. 



            The scope of the June 14 massive military parade is starting to come into focus, according to multiple sources familiar with the planning. It will include nearly 7,000 soldiers, 370 vehicles and 70 aircraft, according to a document reviewed by CNN.
    


            The event will take place in Washington, DC, on the Army's 250th birthday, which is also President Donald Trump's 79th birthday.
    


            Trump is expected to watch the event from a review stand at the edge of the White House ellipse. He's also set to deliver remarks and participate in an enlistment event as part of the pomp and circumstance Trump has been eager to put on display.
    


            Nearly 7,000 soldiers will march the parade route alongside 370 vehicles, including both historic and modern-day machinery, according to a document seen by CNN. The Army's Golden Knights will parachute over the Ellipse and nearly 70 aircraft will conduct flyovers at various parts of the event.
    


            The parade will showcase vehicles, machinery and uniforms from every war. CNN has previously reported that the parade is expected to cost tens of millions of dollars.
    


            For Trump, the event will be a test run for America 250, a planned yearlong celebration of America's birthday in 2026 that Trump has taken steps to make a reality.
    


            Richard Grenell, the interim director of the Kennedy Center, said on Monday the center found $26 million in phantom revenue that they plan to refer to the US attorney's office.
    


                    “Our great new CFO went through the ‘24 and ‘25 budgets of the Kennedy Center and found $26 million in phantom revenue, fake revenue. It's criminal. We're going to refer this to the US attorney's office here,” Grenell said during a Kennedy Center board dinner at the White House that President Donald Trump and other board members attended.
                





            He criticized the deferred maintenance of the Kennedy Center as being “criminal” and claimed, “it has been terrible.”
    


            Grenell's comments come as he replaced former Kennedy Center President Deborah Rutter in February after Trump took over as chairman.
    


            Rutter said in a statement to CNN that she was “deeply troubled” by the allegations and stands by her assertion that the Kennedy Center was “fiscally sound” at the time of her departure.
    


                    “I am deeply troubled by the false allegations regarding the management of the Kennedy Center being made by people without the context or expertise to understand the complexities involved in nonprofit and arts management, which has been my professional experience for 47 years,” Rutter said.
                





            Grenell also said that Attorney General Pam Bondi, who sits on the board of trustees, has already heard the details of the finances.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Kennedy Center for comment.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that the continued involvement of the United States in peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia was “important,” as he voiced his country's commitment to further direct talks with the Kremlin.
    


                    “We are discussing with our partners the details and ideas from yesterday's conversation with US President (Donald) Trump. It is important that America continues to be a participant in the peace-making process,” Zelensky said following yesterday's call between Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.
                





            “It is America that they fear in Russia. It is American influence that can save many lives if it influences Putin for the sake of ending the war,” Zelensky said.
    


            Following his two-hour call with Putin, Trump said Ukraine and Russia must talk directly, “as only they can.”
    


            The Ukrainian president added that discussions were underway regarding future direct talks between Ukraine and Russia.
    


            “We continue to work at various levels with the United States on sanctions. We are convincing them that this is what is needed to prevent Putin from lying about ending the war. Time will prove us right,” Zelensky said.
    


            Earlier today, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that threatening Russia with additional sanctions could cause Moscow to stop talking about a potential end to the war with Ukraine.
    


            President Donald Trump and GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky found themselves in a familiar position earlier today as the commander-in-chief met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill: opposing each other.
    


            Walking into his closed-door meeting with House Republicans, Trump singled out Massie directly, who opposes the president's legislative agenda.
    


                    “I don't think Thomas Massie understands government. I think he's a grandstander, frankly,” Trump said ahead of the meeting. “We don't even talk to him much. I think he should be voted out of office.”
                





            Massie told CNN that inside the room, Trump called him out “eight times.” But he said the president was nicer to him there than his public comments would reflect, and the lawmaker made light of the ire he faces from the president.
    


            “I was flattered,” Massie said. “I wasn't offended by anything he said.”
    


            Massie is comfortable being the lone no vote against Trump, and he has staked out a rare position in the Republican Party where he finds his most consistent company to be his state's senator, GOP Sen. Rand Paul.
    


            While he predicted his Republican colleagues would cave to Trump's demands, Massie said he remains immovable.
    


                    “It's math, is what it is,” he said. “If this vote were based on intuition or likeability of the president, I might vote yes. But it's not. Not for me. There are real consequences. And they probably have the votes anyway to pass it. I think he was talking to the people who have leaned no, trying to persuade them more than me.”
                





            President Donald Trump had a blunt message for Republicans during his meeting with the House GOP conference this morning: Stop negotiating and move ahead with his massive domestic policy bill, according to sources in the room.
    


            It was a message directed to the hard-right House Freedom Caucus and a group of Northeastern lawmakers who are making demands to change the bill.
    


            Trump also had an exchange with GOP New York Rep. Mike Lawler, who made his case for a higher cap on state and local tax deductions, according to a source in room.
    


            Trump's message: Time to stop haggling and move ahead with vote.
    


            Elon Musk on Tuesday said he would spend “a lot less” on politics moving forward – potentially signaling a retreat on the part of President Donald Trump's largest campaign benefactor and one of the most controversial figures to emerge in his administration.
    


                    “I think, in terms of political spending, I'm going to do a lot less in the future,” the Tesla CEO said during an interview at the Qatar Economic Forum.
                





            When he was asked why, Musk said: “I think I've done enough.”
    


            But Musk also left the door open to changing his mind, adding: “If I see a reason do political spending in the future, I will do it.”
    


            Musk, the world's richest man, spent more than $290 million in the 2024 campaign to help elect Trump and Republicans to Congress and previously committed to putting $100 million into political groups controlled by Trump, CNN and other outlets have reported.
    


            It's not clear whether the Tesla CEO's remarks signal any change in that financial pledge. A Musk political aide on Tuesday declined to comment.
    


More context: Musk's prominent role in slashing federal spending through his work with the Department of Government Efficiency has made him a prominent political target for Democrats, who made him the centerpiece of their winning strategy in last month's election for a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat.
    


            Musk has begun to pull back from his once-prominent role in the administration.
    


            In the at-times contentious interview Tuesday, Musk insisted that his position in government does not pose a conflict of interest with his varied business interests. “I'm simply an adviser,” Musk said. “I don't have formal power.”

            President Donald Trump told House Republicans directly this morning to not let the debate over state and local taxes, known as SALT, impede the passage of his legislative agenda, according to a senior White House official.
    


                    “The President also made it clear he's losing patience with all holdout factions of the House Republican Conference, including the SALT Caucus and the House Freedom Caucus. The President is clear: he wants EVERY Republican to vote yes,” according to the official.
                





            Trump told reporters after the meeting that he never said he was “losing patience” and that it was a “meeting of love.” But several holdouts indicated after the meeting that they still weren't sold on the massive tax bill.
    


What is the SALT caucus?: It's a loose coalition of roughly a half-dozen Republicans from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California who have sought to repeal the 2017 deduction cap on state and local taxes.
    


            It's unclear if President Donald Trump was able to move the needle with key Republican hardliners who are currently opposed to approving his sweeping legislative agenda.
    


Here's what some lawmakers are saying: 



House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris poured cold water on the idea that  Trump moved the needle in convincing him and other hardliners to soften their positions.
    


            “No, we are still a ways away, but we can get there,” said Harris, who has called for more time to work through the negotiations. The Maryland GOP congressman said this closed-door meeting was not the venue to raise his continued opposition.
    


Louisiana Rep. Clay Higgins, who like other hardliners want more time with the bill, told CNN he wasn't sure if Trump changed his mind to vote this week.
    


            Still, Higgins called Trump a “unifier” as he left the meeting and said the president acknowledged the opposing groups in the House Republican conference.
    


                    “He's comfortable with every faction that exists within our conference,” Higgins said. “He is completely respectful of the positions of various factions, including my own, who feel very strongly.”
                





            Meanwhile, South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson called the meeting with the president “powerful” and said that “you could tell that he did move the room.”
    


            “That is as animated as I've seen him on policy issues,” Johnson said.
    


                    The president, he said, “has grown frustrated with the pace of our progress. He made it pretty clear we need to quit screwing around.”
                





South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman said Trump did a “great job” in his meeting with House Republicans on Tuesday, but did not yet commit to voting for the bill.
    


            “My understanding he just wants the bill passed. Whether there's modifications, he wants the bill passed,” he said, adding that the House Rules Committee, which he sits on, still plans to meet overnight to advance the bill.
    


CNN's Sarah Ferris and Alison Main contributed reporting. 



This post has been updated with additional comments from GOP lawmakers. 



            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday said habeas corpus “is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country” – misstating the legal principle that President Donald Trump is considering suspending to accelerate deportations.
    


            During a hearing in front of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Noem was asked by Democratic New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan to define the legal concept.
    


            Noem responded: “Well, habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country, and suspend their right to – ”
    


            Hassan cut her off: “Excuse me, that's incorrect.” She explained it's a legal principle that requires the government to provide a reason for detaining people. It allows people who believe they are being unlawfully detained or imprisoned to petition for their release in court.
    


            Under further questioning, Noem said she supports habeas corpus but added: “I also recognize that the president of the United States has the authority under the Constitution to decide if it should be suspended or not.”
    


Meanwhile with regards to a DHS reality show, Noem said there are “no plans whatsoever” for her agency to participate in one.
    


            Her comments come after CNN and other outlets reported that a reality TV producer submitted a pitch for the agency to participate in a show where immigrants compete against each other for US citizenship.
    


            President Donald Trump warned Republican lawmakers not to touch Medicaid except for waste fraud and abuse during today's meeting, according to two sources.
    


            Trump said “don't f**ck around” on Medicaid, according to the sources in the room. His comments come as questions have been raised over how many Americans would lose access to Medicaid benefits under Republicans' proposed package.
    


            Trump also repeated his message that Democratic governors are to blame for high state and local taxes and said they need to deal with it, according to a source.
    


            Trump didn't sound particularly warm to fighting for state and local taxes (SALT), the source said.
    


            GOP Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert said Trump was “very serious” about the state and local tax deduction — a key sticking point in talks on his agenda bill.
    


            “I'm from Colorado. I'm a SALT state. I get it. But President Trump is very firm on this bill passing and being a good product,” she said.
    


                    Asked whether holdouts on the bill got the president's message, Boebert said: “President Trump is speaking directly to many people individually.”
                





            Trump is meeting with House GOP members as key conservatives remain opposed to approving his sweeping tax and spending bill.

            President Donald Trump on Tuesday argued that Republicans are “tremendously unified” despite party infighting over his sweeping budget and tax cuts bill.
    


                    “We have a tremendously unified party. I don't think we've ever had a party like this. There are some people who want a couple of things that maybe I don't like or that they're not going to get,” Trump said arriving on Capitol Hill to meet with the House Republican conference.
                





            He praised House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate GOP leader John Thune, adding that “we're a very unified party.”
    


                    “And we're going to have a bill, the one big, beautiful bill, I think it's going to be – It's the biggest bill ever passed, and we've got to get it done,” Trump said.
                





            He insisted that the bill would provide “the biggest tax cut in the history of our country” and that Republicans are “not changing” Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security, despite the proposal to add work requirements for Medicaid benefits.
    


            “We're not doing any cutting of anything meaningful. The only thing we're cutting is waste, fraud and abuse. With Medicaid, waste fraud and abuse,” he said.
    


            Before going behind closed doors to meet with the House Republican conference, Trump told reporters: “This is really just a pep talk.”
    


            The president acknowledged his tax and spending cuts bill would be amended but that it would move forward as GOP leadership plans to bring it to a vote in the House this week.

            Conservative hardliner Rep. Thomas Massie called the White House's insistence that President Donald Trump's major policy bill would not raise the US deficit “a joke.”
    


            “No, that's a joke. That's a joke,” the Kentucky Republican told CNN while heading into the House GOP meeting that Trump is scheduled to attend.
    


                    “Is Russ Vought saying that? … OK, well, Russ Vought knows better. He's the OMB [Office of Management and Budget] director. I mean, over here, the people in favor of this bill say that under the policies of this bill, we're going to add $20 trillion to debt over the next 10 years, which is $3.5 to $5 trillion more than would have been added otherwise,” he said.
                





            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said yesterday that the sweeping bill aimed to advance Trump's legislative agenda “does not add to the deficit” — despite multiple nonpartisan reports that say otherwise.
    


            Asked if he's concerned about pressure on him to support the bill as it currently stands, Massie told CNN: “They wrote off my vote weeks ago.”
    


            Meanwhile, GOP Rep. Tim Burchett — who's not yet in support of the bill — told CNN that he's concerned about the bill's increase to the SALT tax deduction and wants to see “sufficient” work requirements for Medicaid benefits to “eliminate the fraud.”
    


            “I want to hear what the president has to say,” he said.
    


            House GOP leaders are hoping to pass President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” later this week and send it over to the Senate.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson has been engaging in last-ditch negotiations over several unresolved issues involving Medicaid, green energy tax credits and the state and local tax deduction.
    


Here are key things to know about what is in the bill: 



            • The package includes several controversial measures that would deeply cut into two of the nation's key safety net programs —Medicaid and food stamps — while making permanent essentially all of the trillions of dollars of individual income tax breaks contained in the GOP's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. What's more, it would fulfill Trump's campaign promises to cut taxes on tips and overtime, albeit temporarily.
    


            • The magnitude of the measures is evident in the estimates of the cost they'd incur or the savings they would produce. The tax package approved by the Ways and Means Committee carries a price tag of a little more than $3.8 trillion over 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Meanwhile, the Energy and Commerce plan, which contains contentious cuts to Medicaid, would reduce the deficit by at least $880 billion over a decade, according to an initial Congressional Budget Office analysis.
    


            • Republicans are aiming to make good on other Trump campaign promises, such as significant investments in staffing at the US southern border, new systems to discourage immigration into the US and a gigantic new missile defense shield. Then there are other longtime GOP policy goals, such as an overhaul of the nation's outdated air traffic system, new fees targeting electric cars and a pivot away from federal student loans.
    


            • Overall, the House is looking for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset the legislation's sweeping tax breaks and investments in defense and immigration control. The measures could still change before they are voted on by the full chamber, and Senate Republicans are likely to make additional changes even after the House passes the legislation.

            President Donald Trump has arrived on Capitol Hill, where he will meet with House Republicans Tuesday as they negotiate his sweeping tax and spending cuts package.
    


            Trump's visit to the Capitol comes as he aims to unite Republicans in pushing through his legislative agenda, which House Speaker Johnson hopes to pass by Memorial Day.
    


            This marks the sixth time that Trump has been on Capitol Hill this year for various engagements including a meeting with Republican senators during the transition period, his indoor Inauguration ceremony, the National Prayer Breakfast, Friends of Ireland luncheon and delivering an address to a joint session of Congress.
    


            Trump's motorcade departed from the North Lawn, without an opportunity for press to shout questions.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio plans to defend his overhaul of the State Department to lawmakers amid a proposed rescission of $20 billion in funding.
    


            Rubio is facing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday morning for the first time since his confirmation hearing. He will also testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee, the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Appropriations Committee over the next two days.
    


            Although he was unanimously confirmed as top US diplomat, some Democrats have since expressed regret and disappointment at Rubio's foreign policy stances as well as his overseeing of the destruction of the US Agency for International Development and sweeping changes at the State Department.
    


            According to his prepared opening statement, Rubio plans to argue that a proposed budget of $28.5 billion “will allow the Department to fulfill its mission while also proposing the rescission of $20 billion in duplicative, wasteful, and ideologically driven programs.” Such a proposal is tens of billions of dollars lower than past State Department budgets.
    


            Rubio plans to say that the budget reflects the State Department's reorganization, which includes a 15% staffing cut and has rattled the workforce.
    


                    “A core principle of this reorganization is the belief that what matters is not the size of budgets but the agility with which they can be deployed,” he will say, according to his prepared remarks.
                





            The top US diplomat will claim that the State Department has “found billions” in foreign aid awards “diverted to ideological causes, including climate activism, diversity, equity, inclusion, and LGBTQ initiatives in foreign nations.”
    


            As he has done in the past, he will applaud “the world's most talented diplomatic workforce,” but plans to say that “they deserve better.”
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that President Donald Trump will call on House Republicans “to get in line” to pass his legislative agenda this morning.
    


            Johnson said he had just gotten off the phone with Trump, who was on his way to Capitol Hill
    


                    “He's excited to talk to House republicans this morning, and we're excited to have him,” the speaker said.
                





            “This is a big week for his agenda, for all of us. we've been working on reconciliation for more than a year, as you all know, and it all comes down to these details,” Johnson said.
    


            “And I think the president is going to encourage everyone this morning to get in line and get the votes done. We need to deliver this to the American people, the America first agenda is all wrapped up in one big bill, and we're really excited to deliver it this morning so we're delighted.”
    


            Meanwhile, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said that Trump is “always the closer,” and the president wanted to come speak with everyone on Capitol Hill again.
    


            Scalise Pushed back on Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris' previous suggestion that Republicans delay debate on the current draft of the legislative bill further, saying GOP leadership's plan is still to hold a full House vote Wednesday or Thursday.
    


This post has been updated with reporting on Scalise's remarks.  



            As President Donald Trump trades the Oval Office for the halls of Congress today, his main priority is to urge his party to stop squabbling and make progress on moving a major piece of legislation that contains his core promises from the campaign trail, White House officials tell CNN.
    


            While House Republicans remain sharply divided over a number of sticking points in the $4 trillion bill, the reality from the president's point of view is that he has succeeded in getting what he wants in the package, the officials said.
    


            His campaign-driven goals to deliver sweeping tax cuts and no tax on tips and overtime pay are what Trump cares most about — the rest is simply negotiating to the finish line.
    


            Still, Trump has a monumental task before him to try and bring the factions of the party together. With a slim majority in the House leaving little room for detractors, his attempt to do so will be a major test of his dealmaking abilities.
    


            As of this morning, Trump had not directly engaged in whipping the vote of individual members, the officials said, though several of his aides have been closely involved in behind-the-scenes negotiations.
    


                    “The White House isn't freaking out yet,” one person close to Trump told CNN. “The president has been down this road before. He and the team understand that pushing through a bill of this size is going to take time. The key is starting the clock.”
                





            The White House officials said the president likely will not get into the specific, nitty-gritty details that are still being worked out.
    


            His main task is to ensure the House GOP understands the process of muscling this bill through begins in earnest.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson did not come to a resolution with members of the SALT (state and local tax) caucus last night, but members were promised more data in the morning and that talks will continue.
    


            “We are continuing to work on it. Not a final resolution yet but I think we are getting close,” Johnson told reporters following the roughly one-hour meeting late Monday evening.
    


            Following the meeting, New York Rep. Andrew Garbarino said leadership presented lawmakers with “proposals” to consider but they are seeking additional clarity and data.
    


                    “They hope to have some numbers back to us by the morning,” Garbarino added. “The speaker is doing everything he can to get us to yes and I think everybody in that room really appreciates the meeting.”
                





            Trump plans to make his pitch to Republicans at a meeting at the US Capitol today, CNN previously reported.
    


            Republican leadership is targeting a Wednesday or Thursday floor vote.
    


            When pressed on when the floor vote will be, Johnson maintained: “We'll have it before Memorial Day.”
    


What is the SALT caucus?: It's a loose coalition of roughly a half-dozen Republicans from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California who have sought to repeal the 2017 deduction cap on state and local taxes.
    


            US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke for two hours on the phone yesterday. It's the third known time the two leaders spoke since Trump was inaugurated in January and comes as he has grown increasingly frustrated with the Russian president's refusal to strike a peace deal with Ukraine.
    


            Before talking to Putin, Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
    


Here's what we know about developments after the Trump-Putin call:



What Putin said: The Russian president said the conversation with Trump was “frank and substantive,” and thanked him for US support in “resuming the direct talks between Russia and Ukraine,” according to Russia state news agency TASS. Putin also said Trump “expressed his position on the secession of hostilities, ceasefire, and from my end, I have emphasized that Russia stands for peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis. We just need to outline the most effective routes of moving towards peace.” The two leaders did not discuss a timeframe for talks, a Kremlin spokesperson said.
    


What Trump said: “Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War,” Trump announced on Truth Social after his call. “The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of.” Trump also said that the “tone and spirit” of his conversation with Putin “were excellent,” and that “Russia wants to do largescale TRADE” with the US when the war is over.



Trump informs allies: Trump also said on Truth Social that after his call with Putin ended, he immediately informed the following leaders about the contents of the call after it ended: Zelensky, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Finnish President Alexander Stubb.
    


How Zelensky responded: Zelensky called for further sanctions on the Russian banking and energy sectors. He said a future location for a next round of talks — which would be aimed first at achieving a ceasefire — would be discussed. Zelensky also said Ukraine will not withdraw any of its troops from Russian-held regions of its country. Zelensky also said Russia was “trying to buy time” in negotiations in order to continue its war, after the call between Trump and Putin failed to extract concessions from the Russian leader.
    


US-Russia prisoner swap: Putin and Trump also discussed a US-Russia prisoner swap, involving nine people for nine others, Kremlin presidential aide Yury Ushakov said.
    


On the ground: Ukraine and Russia accused each other of launching attack drones on one another overnight, hours after Putin spoke by phone with Trump.
    


            President Donald Trump will make a personal pitch to House Republicans to pass his “big, beautiful bill” at a meeting at the Capitol today, according to four people familiar with the plans.
    


            Trump will deliver remarks at the House GOP conference meeting at 9 a.m. ET.
    


            It will be the first time Trump will speak in person with the full group of House Republicans since the conference began drafting the president's agenda.
    


What to know: House Republican leaders are still trying to resolve major internal battles over Trump's massive domestic policy bill even as Speaker Mike Johnson is engaged in last-ditch negotiations to win over GOP members' conflicting demands before an expected floor vote later this week.

            The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted a request from Republican Maine state lawmaker Laurel Libby to restore her voting power for the next legislative session after she was censured earlier this year for expressing opposition to transgender athletes competing in girls sports in a controversial post on X.
    


            The court made its decision with a brief, unsigned order, that did not explain its reasoning.
    


            Two liberal justices – Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson – dissented.
    


            Libby was censured in February by a Democratic-controlled Maine House after she posted on social media about a Maine high school girls' indoor track and field state championship, where the transgender student who won first place in girls' pole vault had competed in the boys' division the previous year.
    


            The post on X, which received national attention, included the names of students and photographs of the athletes she was criticizing. She insists the goal of her post was to draw attention to the competition.
    


            Libby is an outspoken critic on the issue of allowing transgender athletes to participate in girls' sports. Last month, she joined Attorney General Pam Bondi at a press conference where Bondi announced that the Justice Department would be suing Maine for refusing to comply with President Donald Trump's ban on transgender athletes in high school sports.
    


            The Maine lawmaker sued the state's House speaker along with other Democrats, following her censure, saying that her First Amendment rights had been violated and that her constituents were being disenfranchised by her inability to vote or speak on the House floor.
    


            In a scathing dissent Tuesday, Jackson argued that the decision to intervene in cases where there was not apparent emergency was “both in­equitable and unwise.”
    


            Libby had not “asserted that there are any sig­nificant legislative votes scheduled in the upcoming weeks; that there are any upcoming votes in which Libby's partici­pation would impact the outcome; or that they will other­wise suffer any concrete, imminent, and significant harm while the lower court considers this matter,” Jackson wrote.
    


            Jackson said she was concerned by the fact that the high court was intervening on an emergency basis despite there being no clear indication that Libby would miss any votes before the censure was reviewed by lower courts.
    


            “Not very long ago, this court treaded carefully with re­spect to exercising its equitable power to issue injunctive relief at the request of a party claiming an emergency,” Jackson said, asserting that justices often declined to intervene in such cases absent “the most critical and exigent circumstances.”
    


            “Those days are no more,” Jackson wrote.
    


            “Today's court,” Jackson wrote, “barely pauses to acknowledge” what she described as “important threshold limitations on the exercise of its own authority.”
    


            “It opts instead,” she wrote, “to dole out er­ror correction as it sees fit.”

President Donald Trump's efforts to pressure GOP holdouts to support the “one big, beautiful” reconciliation bill with a plea for unity failed Tuesday morning despite a personal visit to Capitol Hill.

Blue-state House Republicans seeking a higher state and local tax cap emerged from the House Republican conference meeting without moving an inch on their opposition. Several House Freedom Caucus members, who have urged deeper cuts into Medicaid spending, also left the meeting as holdouts.

Inside the conference room, sources told the Washington Examiner that Trump called out SALT Caucus lawmakers, asking them to back down and accept the newest offer Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) proposed after a meeting Monday night. The speaker offered a $40,000 cap that goes back to the originally proposed $30,000 after four years.

Trump specifically pointed to Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) in the meeting, telling him, “I know your district better than you do. If you lose because of SALT, you were going to lose anyway.”

Lawler and fellow New York Rep. Nick LaLota (R) were unconvinced by Trump's speech. Lawler said he's still a “no” on the reconciliation bill, which calls for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset extending Trump's 2017 tax breaks.

“This is the single biggest issue that I've talked about, and while I respect the president, I'm not budging,” Lawler said coming out of the meeting.

When asked about the president's remarks targeting him, he referred to being one of the three Republicans representing a blue district.

“Look, the President can say whatever he wants, and I respect him, but the fact is, I certainly understand my district. I'm one of only three Republican members that won in a district [former Vice President] Kamala Harris won, and I did so for reasons,” Lawler said.

He said on Monday that the GOP wouldn't have the majority “if you didn't have members in seats like mine.”

“And so if they think we're going to throw our constituents under the bus to appease [the Freedom Caucus], it's not happening,” Lawler added.

LaLota also said he's still a “no” on the bill and told reporters ahead of the meeting he was not in favor of the $40,000 cap. He thinks the president is still on board to “do right by middle class Americans,” despite Trump seeming to soften on SALT. He told reporters ahead of the meeting with Republicans that raising the SALT cap benefits Democratic governors.

“We don't want to benefit Democrat governors,” the president said.

LaLota interpreted the president's message on SALT as “figure it out.”

“Those numbers last night didn't work for me and the members of the SALT caucus,” LaLota said of the $40,000 cap. “We need a little more salt on the table to get to yes. And I hope the president's presence motivates my leadership to give us a number that we can go sell back at home … All they need from this town is [a] little salt. I don't think that's unreasonable.”

SALT Republicans are meeting with Johnson at 2 p.m., per Punchbowl News.

The president has called on Republicans to stop being “grandstanders” and unite behind the bill, supporting the speaker's ambitious deadline of passing the legislation by Memorial Day.

A White House official told the Washington Examiner that Trump “made it clear he's losing patience with all holdout factions of the House Republican Conference, including the SALT Caucus and the House Freedom Caucus. The President is clear: he wants EVERY Republican to vote yes.”

Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-SD) said that Trump was the “most animated” he's seen on policy.

“He's frustrated with the case of our progress; he made it pretty clear,” the South Dakota Republican said. “We need to quit screwing around and we need to get the one big, beautiful bill passed.”

Trump denied he was losing patience with House Republicans, calling it a “meeting of love.” 

“I didn't even talk about that — in fact, it's the opposite. I'm not losing patience, we're ahead of schedule … Why don't you go back to your source and tell them they're liars, if the source even exists,” Trump said.

The Freedom Caucus didn't receive much of an admonishment from Trump inside the conference room, though the president told his loyal rabblerousers that they needed to “leave Medicaid alone.” Fiscal hawks within the hard-line conservative caucus have argued the bill doesn't go far enough to address spending or the deficit, and they have advocated pushing up the effective date for the program's work requirements. 

“Don't f*** around with Medicaid,” Trump said simply.

Centrists such as Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE), who had expressed concerns about reforms to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, were pleased with Trump's messaging on the beneficiary program. 

“That's what the conference needed,” Bacon said, coming out of the meeting with Trump.

Rep. David Valadao (R-CA) agreed, saying it “reinforced the message I've been saying for a while: Don't touch it.”

Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) said he's not 100% satisfied with the bill and told reporters leaving Tuesday's meeting with Trump that he thought the president did a “great job.”

“One of the greatest speeches I've heard. And it's real. It was off the cuff. And he said the right things,” Norman said.

Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris (R-MD) is also unmoved by Trump's plea for unity, adding that he doesn't think the president has secured enough votes to pass the legislation.

“We're still a long ways away, but we can get there — maybe not by tomorrow,” Harris said.

Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), former chairman of the HFC, told reporters he was still a no on the current deal, but said he is “looking through it.”

Rep. Eric Burlison (R-MO), a Freedom Caucus member, told reporters leaving the meeting that he was still a “no” as of now. His concerns surround the backloading of savings versus the frontloading of spending.

“I think that there's some things that we could move easily to make it more comfortable for a lot of people like myself,” Burlison said.

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who has an icy relationship with Trump due to his frequent opposition to Republican-backed spending bills, is still a “hard no” on the bill. However, he said he thinks Trump was able to convince the Freedom Caucus and SALT Caucus folks to “give up their fights.”“I predict they get the bill passed,” Massie said. “He was very personal, very persuasive.”

Trump hasn't had very kind words to say about Massie lately. Ahead of the meeting, he told reporters that he doesn't think Massie “understands government” and he should be “voted out of office.”

Massie said he wasn't “offended by anything [Trump] said.” 

“I'm the only Republican right now that you can count on to vote against this vote … It's not consequential to my vote today, like whether he endorses me or attacks me. It's just not — doesn't change the facts,” Massie added.

Some Republicans are pleased with what they heard, but understand it will take more than an impassioned speech from Trump.

“I think you get the sort of vibe that everybody's, you know, ‘rah, rah,' and we're together, and then everybody walks out of the room,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rick Crawford (R-AK) told reporters. “We'll see. I mean, at the end of the day, people have to make a decision on their own, they have to calculate– I guess, the political calculation has to be made at home.”

The next step in the reconciliation process is a Rules Committee meeting at 1 a.m. on Wednesday. Both Norman and Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), who have said they are not pleased with the legislation as it stands, sit on the committee. If both vote against the bill in committee, it can still go to the floor.

After the meeting, Norman wouldn't say whether he was swayed to vote “yes” on the legislation. But he said on Monday he'd allow the bill to pass through the Rules Committee, as he thinks it deserves a floor vote.

Harris and Roy have said they think it would be best to postpone the Rules vote, as more work must be done.

“We made enough progress that we thought in good faith, we should move it forward,” Roy said Monday of the legislation advancing out of the Budget Committee. “But let's be clear, there are still very strong outstanding questions, and I think there are people across the entire conference who recognize that, and it is a mistake for this important of a policy to jam it through.”

Johnson, however, is in high spirits after the meeting with Trump and is moving full steam ahead with pushing for a floor vote as soon as Wednesday evening. 

REPUBLICANS MUSCLE THE ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' OUT OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE

At a press conference following lawmakers' meeting with Trump, he said there was “high energy and high excitement” inside the conference room. He said, “Failure is not an option,” and expressed confidence that Republicans could pass the legislation this week. 

Leaving the presser, the speaker said he would now spend the day meeting with the “small subgroups” and “tie up the remaining loose ends.”

            • On the stand: Sharay Hayes, a former male exotic dancer, is testifying in the federal sex-trafficking trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs.
    


            • Earlier testimony: Earlier today, Cassie Ventura's mother, Regina Ventura, testified about threats she said Combs made against her and her daughter. Over four days last week, Cassie Ventura — who dated Combs and is one of his accusers — testified that she endured physical and sexual abuse from him and detailed how Combs orchestrated drug-fueled sex performances called “Freak Offs.”
    


            • Federal charges: Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison.
    


            • Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline.



            Sharay Hayes, a male escort who said he was hired by Sean “Diddy” Combs and Cassie Ventura, is back on the stand and testifying about his interactions with Ventura and Combs
    


            He said sometimes he'd meet them on consecutive days — but those instances would be months apart.
    


            Hayes said he always met them at a hotel in New York City. Sometimes he'd meet them at 2:30 a.m. ET and wouldn't leave until after 11 a.m. ET.
    


            Hayes said he usually received a message from Ventura planning a few hours in advance.
    


            The judge is back on the bench, although the jury hasn't been brought back in yet.
    


            When the jury comes back, Sharay Hayes, a former male exotic dancer, will continue testifying.
    


            The jury is in day seven of Sean “Diddy” Combs' federal racketeering and sex-trafficking trial. Here's a recap of what witnesses said on the stand:
    


David James, former assistant to Combs:



Regina Ventura, Cassie Ventura's mother:



Sharay Hayes, male escort



            The jury has been dismissed for lunch until 1 p.m. ET.
    


            Male escort Sharay Hayes will continue testifying after the break.
    


            Sharay Hayes, testifying about his first interaction with Cassie Ventura and Sean “Diddy Combs” at Trump International Hotel in New York City, said he didn't know the man in the room was Combs.
    


            On another occasion when he joined Combs and Ventura at a hotel, Hayes testified, the TV displayed a message: “The Essex House would like to welcome Mr. Sean Combs.” Hayes said he was a fan of Combs and already followed him on social media at the time.
    


            After he saw the TV message, Hayes recognized Ventura from photos of the couple together, he said.
    


            Hayes joined the couple for similar interactions about eight to 12 times in total, he testified.
    


            Testifying more about the first encounter he had with Sean “Diddy” Combs and Cassie Ventura, Sharay Hayes said he followed Ventura's lead and “mimicked” what she did.
    


            Hayes said that when Ventura began to pour baby oil on herself, he did too. Eventually, he saw a man enter the room, he testified.
    


            Hayes recalled that Combs would speak to Ventura giving “subtle directions,” including adjustments he wanted to the lighting and to how her body was positioned.
    


            Hayes said that at the end of the encounter, Ventura thanked him and handed him an additional $1,200.
    


            Sharay Hayes continued describing his first encounter with Cassie Ventura and Sean “Diddy” Combs, at Trump International Hotel in New York City:
    


            Ventura greeted him at the door in a robe when he arrived, and he believed she was also wearing a wig, he said. He did not recognize her at the time, he tesitified.
    


            Ventura invited him into the suite, and she explained that she didn't want him to actually dance. She told him “her and (her) husband liked to create a sexy scene” involving the application of baby oil, and  that her husband eventually would come out to watch, Hayes testified.
    


            Ventura told him to ignore her husband, Hayes said. “I was specifically told to not acknowledge her husband, try not to look at him, no communication or anything,” he testified.
    


            After explaining the situation, Ventura handed him “a stack of cash” and said he could change into underwear or a towel in the bathroom. He counted $800 in cash then slipped into a towel, he said.
    


            Sharay Hayes testified that he met Sean “Diddy” Combs and Cassie Ventura sometime in the fall of 2012.
    


            He said he first got a call from Ventura, who told him her name was Janet. She said it was her birthday and her husband said she could hire an exotic dancer for the occassion.
    


            He said he believes they found him through his website.
    


            Hayes said he met Combs and Ventura at Trump International Hotel in New York City that first time. He said he believed he was going there to provide a 30- or 45-minute strip tease dance for a small group.
    


            Sharay Hayes is now on the stand.
    


            Hayes, now 51, said he worked as a male exotic dancer with the stage name “The Punisher” from 2012 to 2016.
    


            Regina Ventura, Cassie Ventura's mother, is now off the witness stand.
    


            Defense attorneys did not cross-examine her. “I don't have any questions for you,” defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said after greeting her.
    


            Regina Ventura, Cassie Ventura's mother, said she visited Cassie and Combs in LA in August 2016 for her daughter's 30th birthday. She and Combs got into a “bitter argument” outside of Cassie's apartment building after Combs “stole” Cassie's phone. Regina Ventura said she called the police.
    


            “We were arguing about the phone, I wanted the phone back and he was holding it,” she said. One of Combs' security guards was standing between them, she said. “I was yelling, screaming, and trying to hit him,” she said, but said that she was not able to hit him.
    


            Regina Ventura said Combs eventually gave her the phone, but then he took Cassie's car.
    


            The jury is now seeing photos of Cassie Ventura that her mother took in December 2011 in her parents' Connecticut home after Sean “Diddy” Combs physically allegedly assaulted her.
    


            Regina Ventura testified that she took the photos to keep the evidence
    


                    “She was bruised, and I wanted to make sure that we memorialized it,” Regina Ventura said.
                





            Regina Ventura said her daughter told her at the time “that she was beaten by Sean Combs.”
    


            These photos were first admitted into evidence during Cassie Ventura's testimony
    


            Regina Ventura said December 2011 was the first time her daughter told her about Combs being physical with her.
    


            Regina Ventura testified about a time prior to that when she read a “blind item” about a celebrity getting beat up in a car with no names included. She said she asked her daughter if it was about her, but Cassie Ventura told her it wasn't about her or Combs, Regina Ventura said.
    


            Regina Ventura, the mother of Cassie Ventura, said Sean “Diddy” Combs contacted her around the same time Cassie Ventura told her Combs threatened to release sexually explicit videos of her.
    


            Regina Ventura said Combs told her he needed $20,000 to “recoup money” he had spent on Cassie Ventura. Regina Ventura said Combs was angry her daughter was now in a relationship with Kid Cudi.
    


            Regina Ventura said she and her husband took a home equity loan to obtain the $20,000 for Combs.
    


                    “That's the only way we could get the money,” she testified.
                





            Combs' bookkeeper sent Regina Ventura an email with wiring instructions she said, so she went to the credit union and then wired the money from her and her husband's account to the Bad Boy account.
    


            Regina Ventura said did it because she was “scared about my daughter's safety.”
    


            She said about four or five days later, the money was returned to her account, but she did not have any communications with Combs about it.
    


            Regina Ventura, Cassie Ventura's mother, testified that her daughter emailed her in December 2011 to say Sean “Diddy” Combs was threatening to release explicit sex tapes of Cassie.
    


            This appears to mesh with Cassie Ventura's earlier testimony that Combs threatened Cassie in December 2011 when he learned she was dating Scott Mescudi, also known as rapper Kid Cudi.
    


            The email said, according to Regina Ventura: “The threats that have been made towards me by Sean ‘Puffy' Combs are that are that he is going to release 2 explicit sex tapes of me. One on Christmas Day, maybe before or right after and another one some time soon after that. He has also said that he will be having someone hurt me and Scott Mescudi physically (he made a point that it wouldn't be by his hands, he actually said he'd be out of the country when it happened).”
    


            Regina Ventura said she felt “physically sick” when she read the email. The message was sent under an alias “Veronica Bang,” the mother said.
    


            The email also was sent to one of Combs' employees, Regina Ventura said.
    


            “I did not understand a lot of it. The sex tapes threw me. I did not know the other person, but knew that he was going to try to hurt my daughter,” Regina Ventura said.
    


Remember: This is what Cassie Ventura said last week about the threat: “He (Combs) told me about videos that he had that he was going to release, and that he was going to hurt Scott and I,” she said, adding the videos he was referring to were of sexual performances called “Freak Offs.” Cassie Ventura also testified Combs told her Kid Cudi's car would be blown up in his driveway before it happened.



            Cassie Ventura's mother, Regina Ventura, who took the stand late this morning, may help prosecutors make the argument that her daughter was coerced and can speak to Cassie Ventura's state of mind, CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson told CNN's Kate Bolduan Tuesday.
    


            “I think they're going to get to any behavioral differences as it relates to Cassie's behavior when she got into the relationship” with Sean “Diddy” Combs “versus ongoing and ending the relationship. That speaks to whether she's coerced. It speaks to her real state of mind,” Jackson said. “Because this issue of coercion is a big battleground. … You either were a freak and you did this and you knew what you were doing, or you did it because he forced you to do it, so to speak.”
    


            Prosecutors have said Combs ran a criminal racketeering enterprise in which he and some in his inner circle coerced women into participating in drug-fueled sex performances he called “Freak Offs.”
    


            Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.
    


            Jackson also said Cassie Ventura's mother could testify if her daughter ever shared her feelings with her after the incidents, as a “recent outcry” witness.
    


            “That's admissible evidence. It's not hearsay, and it goes to the critical issue of whether she was consenting,” Jackson said.
    


            “From a defense perspective, it's a nightmare to cross examine a mother,” Jackson added.
    


            Prosecutors have also said Regina Ventura can testify that in December 2011 Combs demanded she pay him $20,000 for money he spent on her daughter after he learned she was romantically involved with Kid Cudi. Regina Ventura took out a loan and wired the money to Combs. The money was wired back to her without explanation days later, the prosecution said.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo argued she should not be allowed to say that in court as it could be prejudicial to Combs, but Judge Arun Subramanian said Agnifilo could object to the testimony when it comes up, and he'd deal with it then.
    


            Prosecutor Emily Johnson asked Regina Ventura to identify Sean “Diddy” Combs in a photo and explain how she knew him.
    


            “He dated my daughter,” Regina Ventura replied.
    


            Regina Ventura said she first met Combs in 2006 when her daughter, Cassie Ventura, signed with Combs' record label, Bad Boy Records.
    


            Regina Ventura said when her daughter and Combs started dating in New York City, she'd see her daughter about three or four times a year.
    


            When Cassie Ventura moved to California with Combs, Regina Ventura said she saw her less frequently, usually around the holidays.
    


            “It was harder to get to her,” Regina Ventura said.
    


            The jury is coming back in now and court proceedings are resuming.
    


            Prosecutors have called Regina Ventura, Cassie Ventura's mother, to the stand. Prosecutor Emily Johnson is questioning Regina Ventura for the government.
    


            David James is off the stand.
    


            The trial adjourned for a 10-minute recess.
    


            On redirect examination, David James testified that Combs once asked him to falsely report to police about an altercation between Combs and the music mogul's then-chef in Combs' house in Alpine, New Jersey.
    


            “He (Combs) instructed me to say that she (the chef) was the aggressor and hit him first,” James said.
    


            James said he didn't want to make a false report to police, so he drove around New Jersey for a while. When he eventually returned to the house, he told Combs he had made the report, James testified.
    


            This is the same chef – a woman – that James had testified that he, himself, had been in an altercation with in Florida. James testified that Combs told him, “You can't be putting your hands on women,” and warned that he'd have to fire James if it happened again.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo is done cross-examining David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs.
    


            Prosecutor Christy Slavik is back up for re-direct.
    


            On cross-examination, Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo returned to David James' testimony that he overheard Sean “Diddy” Combs tell a business associate that Cassie Ventura was “moldable” and that he had her “right where I want her, she's young.”
    


            James said this conversation occurred “very early on” in Combs' and Ventura's relationship. He said that Kim Porter, the mother of several of Combs' children, had recently moved to LA, and Combs had been spending more time there.
    


            During the cross-examination of David James, the former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs talked of a time he was in an altercation with one of Combs' chefs, and about how Combs confronted him about it.
    


            When asked by defense attorney Marc Agnifilo, James acknowledged that he got into an altercation with one of Combs' then-chefs, a woman, at Combs' Star Island home in Florida.
    


            James testified that he grew upset when the chef tried to tell him where Combs needed to be. James said he “grabbed her two wrists and squeezed her wrists and told her to stay in her … lane.”
    


            The altercation was reported to human resources at Bad Boy Entertainment, and eventually made it back to Combs who confronted James, the ex-assistant to Combs testified.
    


            When he told Combs what had happened, Combs told James, “You can't be putting your hands on women,” and warned that he'd have to fire James if it happened again, James testified.
    


            Combs told him to write the chef a note and get her a gift, James said. James did so, and she eventually forgave him, he testified.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked David James to confirm that he never told Sean “Diddy” Combs before or after he procured cocaine for Combs' friend while they were on a yacht in Saint-Tropez.
    


            Agnifilo suggested Combs wasn't involved at all in the situation and James fulfilled the request because he wanted to.
    


            James said he viewed it as a work-related task that he had to do for Combs' personal friend, but acknowledged he didn't tell his boss about it.
    


            David James testified that there was camaraderie among Sean “Diddy” Combs' staff and that they would often say Comb's record label, Bad Boy Records, was a family.
    


            “Mama Combs called me her son at one point,” James, a former assistant for Combs, said.
    


            James confirmed that he felt a sense of mission working for Combs, and defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked what that mission was.
    


            “To make sure that he was happy and prepared for the day,” James responded.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo has followed up on David James' earlier testimony that Sean “Diddy” Combs typically had a “rider” that listed preferred items that should be in a location before Combs arrived.
    


            Agnifilo confirmed with James that a rider is common for a “high-level” person traveling.
    


            James, who was an assistant to Combs from 2007 to 2009, agreed that the rider allowed for Combs to have a “consistent environment” wherever he went.
    


            Heinz ketchup, for example, was always on the list, James said.
    


            “Ketchup was a big item that he always needed for his food, so it was just the consistency, to create a consistent environment for wherever he was,” James said.
    


Earlier today: James talked of other items he'd lay out before Combs' arrival, including clothing, a toiletry bag, a medicine bag, food and drinks. He said he would organize a collection of about 40 products, mostly skincare, for Combs in hotel bathrooms. When he restocked “personal items,” such as baby oil, lubricant and condoms, James said he would ask security for reimbursement.
    


            James had testified yesterday that part of his job was to prepare hotel rooms for Combs with a list of items, and to “get every environment comfortable.”
    


            David ﻿James, a former assistant for Sean “Diddy” Combs, testfiied that when he purchased “personal items,” including condoms, baby oil, and personal lubricant, for Combs, he would ask the security for cash from Combs' bag.
    


            James said he was instructed not to submit these items for reimbursement through the company because they were “items he didn't want to have a record for.”
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked James to confirm that meant the company didn't pay for these items.
    


            “I mean, it's all his money,” James responded.
    


            David James testified that one of Sean “Diddy” Combs' assistants had to go to the hospital for dehydration after working with Combs for 24 hours straight.
    


            He said the work was demanding, but he was “prepared for the moment” and enjoyed it at times.
    


            He testified there was a common saying among Combs' security guards: “You know what rhymes with tired? Fired.”
    


            David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, is an important prosecution witness for his ability to tell jurors what it was like in the music mogul's inner circle, according to CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson.
    


            “He takes you into the enterprise,” Jackson said.
    


            “Remember about the overall charges, you're looking at RICO,” continued Jackson.
    


            The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, is used to describe 35 offenses, including kidnapping, murder, bribery, arson and extortion.
    


            Prosecutors have said Combs ran a criminal racketeering enterprise in which he and some in his inner circle coerced women into participating in drug-fueled sex performances he called “Freak Offs.”
    


            “So what prosecutors are doing is getting to this bad behavior, not just to dirty Diddy up, which they're doing effectively,” Jackson said. “But also to get you to that RICO issue: This was a bad guy running a criminal enterprise.”
    


            James, an assistant for Combs from 2007 to 2009, also said he recalled a conversation he had with Combs' ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura where she said to him, “Man, this lifestyle is crazy.” He said he agreed and suggested she leave, he testified. “I can't. I can't get out,” Ventura told him, according to James.
    


            “That means coercion…” Jackson said. “This is the government's theory that she had no real choice but to do what she was doing. That's what they're saying. The defense obviously vehemently objects to that, denies it.”
    


            Over four days last week, Ventura testified she endured physical and sexual abuse from Combs and detailed how he orchestrated the “Freak Offs.”
    


            Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.
    


            David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified that he typically rode in a second car to accompany Combs wherever he went.
    


            James said there was usually a second car traveling with Combs for security reasons.
    


            Combs' security personnel typically operated a second car to the right of the vehicle transporting Combs to prevent anyone from “pulling up on him” and potentially assassinating him, James said.
    


            When Sean “Diddy” Combs would go out in public, people would be “almost in a mob around him,” asking for autographs and trying to meet him, Combs' former assistant David James said.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked if Combs tended to be gracious in these situations.
    


            “I don't think ‘gracious' is a word I would use to describe Mr. Combs,” James responded.
    


            Combs didn't typically sign autographs, James said. James said oftentimes, Combs' staff members would sign autographs to mail out to fans.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo suggested repeatedly that David James actually left D-Roc, one of Sean “Diddy” Combs security guards, at the restaurant and he went back with Combs to get him.
    


            James denied this each time, testifying that it wouldn't have made sense to leave him there with Suge Knight outside, wielding a gun.
    


            During cross-examination, David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, was pressed about his travel with Combs. James had testified yesterday he traveled extensively with the music mogul, including internationally.
    


            Today, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked if these were business trips or personal trips. James said there was a “fine line,” since Combs' personal life and business life blended together. He described them as “business-oriented trips.”
    


            “Even on vacation, he's always working,” James said.
    


            Sean Diddy Combs' former assistant David James testified that before he began working for Combs, he was a fan of Sean John, Combs' clothing line.
    


            James said he knew Combs to be a successful, self-made business man who was a “brilliant marketer.”
    


                    “I just respect Mr. Combs from a business perspective,” James said.
                





            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked David James if he was granted immunity for his testimony.
    


            James said he wasn't sure of the details that were brokered by his attorney, but he believes he signed a proffer agreement, a type agreement that gives a person some protection from prosecution.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo referenced documents from David James' meetings with the government, highlighting one where his account of the Mel's Diner event ended before he returned to Combs' home.
    


            He said the government had instructed him not to say anything that could incriminate himself.
    


            The documents also indicate at one point he told them some of the events took place inside the diner, even though he testified today they occurred outside the diner.
    


            “I think these are inaccurate notes,” James said. He maintained that his recollection of the majority of the event has remained consistent.
    


            Agnifilo asked James whether he spoke up at any point when Combs was allegedly telling him to get back in the car to return to Mel's Diner or when Combs was sitting in the back seat with three guns.
    


            James said, “Respectfully Sir, you have someone with three guns in this close proximity, I didn't think I had the option to say something.”
    


            Agnifilo also grilled James about his conversations with prosecutors Tuesday morning before he took the stand again, asking if James was prepped on how to handle the Mel's Diner incident.
    


            James said they mentioned Agnifilo's style, garnering laughs in the courtroom.
    


            “How'd I do,” Agnifilo asked laughing.
    


            “Consistent,” James said.
    


            David James testified about an occasion when he went with Combs' security guard to a diner to get food for Combs and the staff.
    


            When they got there, the security guard saw Combs' rival Marion “Suge” Knight and approached him. They talked briefly before the guard and James went inside to order. When they went back to Combs' house, Combs and Ventura were outside the house arguing. Ventura looked like she'd been crying.
    


            Combs then ordered James to drive him and the security guard back to the diner to look for Knight, James said. Combs sat in the back seat with three hand guns in his lap, James testified.
    


            Knight was gone when they got back to the restaurant, James said.
    


            James said he was “shook up” by the incident. It was first time he felt like he was in danger as Combs' assistant.
    


            James said he gave his notice soon after the incident, offering to stay with Combs for six more months to train a replacement. He left Combs' company in May 2009.
    


            The prosecution's direct questioning of David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, has finished.
    


            Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo is now questioning James on cross-examination.
    


            David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified about an incident when one of Combs' Cartier bracelets went missing, prompting his security to search through all of his and his then-girlfriend's belongings. James said he felt he couldn't refuse the search.
    


            On two other occasions when Combs' possessions went missing, James had to take a lie detector test administered by a man who claimed to have formerly worked for the FBI, he testified. “It was very intimidating,” he said. On both occasions, James' results showed no discrepancies, he said.
    


            James said one of Combs' security agents told him that another former employee, Capricorn Clark, also had to take a lie detector test previously.
    


            David James, Sean “Diddy” Combs' former assistant, is detailing several occasions where he said he supplied Combs' friends with drugs.
    


            On a trip with Combs to Saint-Tropez, a friend of Combs texted James asking him to get cocaine, he testified. James said he arranged for the cocaine for Combs' friend, but said Combs didn't ask him to do it. He said he assumed he had to.
    


            On another occasion, during a party in Los Angeles, James recalled how Combs sent him back to the house to get ecstasy for a friend. James said he went back to Combs' house to get the ecstasy from Combs' medicine bag and brought it back to the party.
    


            David James, an assistant for Sean “Diddy” Combs from 2007 to 2009, testified he saw Combs take drugs and give them to his friends. On a couple occasions, James procured drugs for Combs' friends, he testified.
    


            A person called “One Stop” often brought drugs to Combs, James said. James understood Combs often took Percocet while he was operating his businesses, and preferred to take ecstasy at night, he said.
    


            David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified that occasionally, Combs would ask him to bring certain items — usually an iPod or food — to his hotel rooms while he was staying there.
    


            He recounted an incident in Miami around 2008 when Combs asked him to bring an iPod to his hotel room. James said it took him about an hour to get there, and when he knocked on the door, nobody answered.
    


            He entered the room with his own key and saw Cassie Ventura lying on her back in the hotel room with a white comforter up to her neck.
    


            “She did not move when I entered the room,” he testified.
    


            Combs was in the shower, he said. James mentioned that he did not speak with Combs or Ventura about the incident afterward because it wasn't his job to discuss their personal affairs.
    


            David James, a former assistant for Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified he often set up hotel rooms for Combs. If Combs was staying in New York, his favorite hotel was the Trump International, James said.
    


            James said he would set up things for Combs' before is arrival, including clothing, a toiletry bag, a medicine bag, food and drinks. He said he would organize a collection of about 40 products, mostly skincare, for Combs in the hotel bathroom.
    


            The medicine bag typically carried between 25 and 30 pill bottles, which included ecstasy and Percocet, James said. Some bottles were unmarked, he added.
    


            Combs' security always carried Combs' Louis Vuitton bag, which held personal items and typically $10,000 or more in cash.
    


            James said he would often replenish items for Combs during trips. If he was restocking food and drinks, James said he would pay for them and get reimbursed by Bad Boy Entertainment. When he restocked “personal items,” such as baby oil, lubricant and condoms, James said he would ask security to be reimbursed from the cash in Combs' bag.
    


            When asked if Combs would stay alone when he traveled, James said, “I don't think Mr. Combs ever stayed alone.” While he worked for Combs, James said typically Cassie Ventura would stay with Combs, but there were other women as well, James said.
    


            David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, testified that he was on the computer at Combs' home one night when Combs was out at a club with Cassie Ventura, another assistant, and security.
    


            “As soon as he entered the door, he bee-lined straight for me” and pulled up the computer's search history, James said. Combs told him that someone had written a blog post “lying” about him hitting Ventura, and he wanted to see if James had written it, the former assistant testified.
    


            James said he did not see Ventura that night, but two days later, Combs directed him to bring her food at a nearby hotel. When James brought the food to her hotel room, he was “surprised” to see a member of Combs' staff answer the door instead of Ventura herself. She stayed at the hotel for about a week, he testified.
    


            David James, an assistant for Sean “Diddy” Combs from 2007 to 2009, testified he did not personally observe physical violence between Combs and Cassie Ventura, but heard them argue about her career more than once.
    


            In those arguments, she would express a desire to branch out more into modeling and acting, but Combs would tell her she had to focus on her music career, James testified.
    


Remember: James worked for Combs during the early portion of Combs' relationship with Ventura. Ventura had testified she signed a contract with Combs' company, Bad Boy Records, in early 2006; the pair first began dating around 2007 and split in 2018.
    


            James testified yesterday that Combs had several girlfriends while James worked for him. He described Kim Porter – who shared three children with Combs – as Combs' “main girlfriend,” and then listed four other women, including Ventura, who were his “other girlfriends.”
    


            David James, a former assistant to Sean “Diddy” Combs, is back on the stand. The jury is entering now.
    


            Prosecutor Christy Slavik is continuing her questioning.
    


            Sean “Diddy” Combs' sister is in court today. His children and mother — who have been inside the courtroom on other days — are not yet there today.
    


            Combs is wearing a heather blue sweater, a white collared shirt and dark gray pants. He's talking to his attorney Mac Agnifilo as we wait for court to begin.
    


            Like yesterday, it appears the start of testimony this morning will be delayed because not all jurors are are there.
    


            Four jurors are not yet there, a courtroom deputy said. Yesterday, proceedings were delayed because a juror was running late.
    


            When proceedings do resume: David James, an assistant for Sean “Diddy” Combs from 2007 to 2009, is expected to resume testimony that he started yesterday. James is the first of Combs' former assistants to testify in Combs' racketeering and sex trafficking trial, and the seventh witness to be called by prosecutors so far.
    


            Prosecutors and defense attorneys are debating upcoming testimony from David James, who will continue testifying this morning, and Cassie Ventura's mother, Regina Ventura, who's expected to take the stand later today.
    


            Prosecutors argue Regina Ventura can testify that in December 2011, Sean “Diddy” Combs demanded she pay him $20,000 for money he spent on her daughter after he learned she was romantically involved with Kid Cudi. The money demand came within days of Combs allegedly threatening Cassie Ventura and Kid Cudi and threatening to release sexually explicit videos of her.
    


            Regina Ventura took out a loan and wired the money to Combs. The money was wired back to her without explanation days later. The government has bank records to support the transactions.
    


            Prosecutors say the jury should hear this evidence they say speaks to the coercive control Combs held over Casandra Ventura.
    


            The defense objected to the testimony, saying it would be prejudicial to Combs highlighting the economic disparity between him and the Ventura family. Defense attorney Marc Agnifilo also noted Combs gave the money back.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian said Agnifilo could object to the testimony when it comes up during Regina Ventura's testimony later today and he'd deal with it then.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian is on the bench. The jury is expected to come in at 9 a.m. ET.
    


            The jury in Sean “Diddy” Combs' racketeering and sex-trafficking trial heard testimony from three witnesses yesterday.
    


Here's what they said:



Dawn Richard, a former member of the musical group Danity Kane:



Kerry Morgan, friend of Ventura from 2001 to 2018:



David James, former assistant to Combs:

            • Battle over Trump's agenda: President Donald Trump expressed confidence after meeting with House Republicans on Capitol Hill this morning as he made a personal pitch for passing his sweeping tax and spending cuts bill. Trump urged House Republicans to stop negotiating and move ahead with the bill and warned them to stay away from changes to Medicaid, sources in the meeting told CNN, as GOP holdouts threaten to stall his agenda amid several sticking points. 



            • Top administration officials testify: Several Cabinet secretaries are in the hot seat on Capitol Hill today — including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — as they defend their agencies' budgets in front of respective committees.
    


            • Ukraine war talks: Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that threatening Russia with additional sanctions could cause Moscow to stop talking about a potential end to the war in Ukraine. His remarks come a day after Trump's call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio faced the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today for the first time since his confirmation hearing and he defended his overhaul of the State Department amid a proposed rescission of $20 billion in funding.
    


            He is expected testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee later today, as well as the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Appropriations Committee over the next two days.
    


Here's what else Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations committee: 



            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that the continued involvement of the United States in peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia was “important,” as he voiced his country's commitment to further direct talks with the Kremlin.
    


                    “We are discussing with our partners the details and ideas from yesterday's conversation with US President (Donald) Trump. It is important that America continues to be a participant in the peace-making process,” Zelensky said following yesterday's call between Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.
                





            “It is America that they fear in Russia. It is American influence that can save many lives if it influences Putin for the sake of ending the war,” Zelensky said.
    


            Following his two-hour call with Putin, Trump said Ukraine and Russia must talk directly, “as only they can.”
    


            The Ukrainian president added that discussions were underway regarding future direct talks between Ukraine and Russia.
    


            “We continue to work at various levels with the United States on sanctions. We are convincing them that this is what is needed to prevent Putin from lying about ending the war. Time will prove us right,” Zelensky said.
    


            Earlier today, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that threatening Russia with additional sanctions could cause Moscow to stop talking about a potential end to the war with Ukraine.
    


            President Donald Trump and GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky found themselves in a familiar position earlier today as the commander-in-chief met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill: opposing each other.
    


            Walking into his closed-door meeting with House Republicans, Trump singled out Massie directly, who opposes the president's legislative agenda.
    


                    “I don't think Thomas Massie understands government. I think he's a grandstander, frankly,” Trump said ahead of the meeting. “We don't even talk to him much. I think he should be voted out of office.”
                





            Massie told CNN that inside the room, Trump called him out “eight times.” But he said the president was nicer to him there than his public comments would reflect, and the lawmaker made light of the ire he faces from the president.
    


            “I was flattered,” Massie said. “I wasn't offended by anything he said.”
    


            Massie is comfortable being the lone no vote against Trump, and he has staked out a rare position in the Republican Party where he finds his most consistent company to be his state's senator, GOP Sen. Rand Paul.
    


            While he predicted his Republican colleagues would cave to Trump's demands, Massie said he remains immovable.
    


                    “It's math, is what it is,” he said. “If this vote were based on intuition or likeability of the president, I might vote yes. But it's not. Not for me. There are real consequences. And they probably have the votes anyway to pass it. I think he was talking to the people who have leaned no, trying to persuade them more than me.”
                





            President Donald Trump had a blunt message for Republicans during his meeting with the House GOP conference this morning: Stop negotiating and move ahead with his massive domestic policy bill, according to sources in the room.
    


            It was a message directed to the hard-right House Freedom Caucus and a group of Northeastern lawmakers who are making demands to change the bill.
    


            Trump also had an exchange with GOP New York Rep. Mike Lawler, who made his case for a higher cap on state and local tax deductions, according to a source in room.
    


            Trump's message: Time to stop haggling and move ahead with vote.
    


            Elon Musk on Tuesday said he would spend “a lot less” on politics moving forward – potentially signaling a retreat on the part of President Donald Trump's largest campaign benefactor and one of the most controversial figures to emerge in his administration.
    


                    “I think, in terms of political spending, I'm going to do a lot less in the future,” the Tesla CEO said during an interview at the Qatar Economic Forum.
                





            When he was asked why, Musk said: “I think I've done enough.”
    


            But Musk also left the door open to changing his mind, adding: “If I see a reason do political spending in the future, I will do it.”
    


            Musk, the world's richest man, spent more than $290 million in the 2024 campaign to help elect Trump and Republicans to Congress and previously committed to putting $100 million into political groups controlled by Trump, CNN and other outlets have reported.
    


            It's not clear whether the Tesla CEO's remarks signal any change in that financial pledge. A Musk political aide on Tuesday declined to comment.
    


More context: Musk's prominent role in slashing federal spending through his work with the Department of Government Efficiency has made him a prominent political target for Democrats, who made him the centerpiece of their winning strategy in last month's election for a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat.
    


            Musk has begun to pull back from his once-prominent role in the administration.
    


            In the at-times contentious interview Tuesday, Musk insisted that his position in government does not pose a conflict of interest with his varied business interests. “I'm simply an adviser,” Musk said. “I don't have formal power.”
    


CNN's David Wright contributed reporting to this post. 



            President Donald Trump told House Republicans directly this morning to not let the debate over state and local taxes, known as SALT, impede the passage of his legislative agenda, according to a senior White House official.
    


                    “The President also made it clear he's losing patience with all holdout factions of the House Republican Conference, including the SALT Caucus and the House Freedom Caucus. The President is clear: he wants EVERY Republican to vote yes,” according to the official.
                





            Trump told reporters after the meeting that he never said he was “losing patience” and that it was a “meeting of love.” But several holdouts indicated after the meeting that they still weren't sold on the massive tax bill.
    


What is the SALT caucus?: It's a loose coalition of roughly a half-dozen Republicans from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California who have sought to repeal the 2017 deduction cap on state and local taxes.
    


            It's unclear if President Donald Trump was able to move the needle with key Republican hardliners who are currently opposed to approving his sweeping legislative agenda.
    


Here's what some lawmakers are saying: 



House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris poured cold water on the idea that  Trump moved the needle in convincing him and other hardliners to soften their positions.
    


            “No, we are still a ways away, but we can get there,” said Harris, who has called for more time to work through the negotiations. The Maryland GOP congressman said this closed-door meeting was not the venue to raise his continued opposition.
    


Louisiana Rep. Clay Higgins, who like other hardliners want more time with the bill, told CNN he wasn't sure if Trump changed his mind to vote this week.
    


            Still, Higgins called Trump a “unifier” as he left the meeting and said the president acknowledged the opposing groups in the House Republican conference.
    


                    “He's comfortable with every faction that exists within our conference,” Higgins said. “He is completely respectful of the positions of various factions, including my own, who feel very strongly.”
                





            Meanwhile, South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson called the meeting with the president “powerful” and said that “you could tell that he did move the room.”
    


            “That is as animated as I've seen him on policy issues,” Johnson said.
    


                    The president, he said, “has grown frustrated with the pace of our progress. He made it pretty clear we need to quit screwing around.”
                





South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman said Trump did a “great job” in his meeting with House Republicans on Tuesday, but did not yet commit to voting for the bill.
    


            “My understanding he just wants the bill passed. Whether there's modifications, he wants the bill passed,” he said, adding that the House Rules Committee, which he sits on, still plans to meet overnight to advance the bill.

This post has been updated with additional comments from GOP lawmakers. 



            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday said habeas corpus “is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country” – misstating the legal principle that President Donald Trump is considering suspending to accelerate deportations.
    


            During a hearing in front of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Noem was asked by Democratic New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan to define the legal concept.
    


            Noem responded: “Well, habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country, and suspend their right to – ”
    


            Hassan cut her off: “Excuse me, that's incorrect.” She explained it's a legal principle that requires the government to provide a reason for detaining people. It allows people who believe they are being unlawfully detained or imprisoned to petition for their release in court.
    


            Under further questioning, Noem said she supports habeas corpus but added: “I also recognize that the president of the United States has the authority under the Constitution to decide if it should be suspended or not.”
    


Meanwhile with regards to a DHS reality show, Noem said there are “no plans whatsoever” for her agency to participate in one.
    


            Her comments come after CNN and other outlets reported that a reality TV producer submitted a pitch for the agency to participate in a show where immigrants compete against each other for US citizenship.
    


            President Donald Trump warned Republican lawmakers not to touch Medicaid except for waste fraud and abuse during today's meeting, according to two sources.
    


            Trump said “don't f**ck around” on Medicaid, according to the sources in the room. His comments come as questions have been raised over how many Americans would lose access to Medicaid benefits under Republicans' proposed package.
    


            Trump also repeated his message that Democratic governors are to blame for high state and local taxes and said they need to deal with it, according to a source.
    


            Trump didn't sound particularly warm to fighting for state and local taxes (SALT), the source said.
    


            GOP Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert said Trump was “very serious” about the state and local tax deduction — a key sticking point in talks on his agenda bill.
    


            “I'm from Colorado. I'm a SALT state. I get it. But President Trump is very firm on this bill passing and being a good product,” she said.
    


                    Asked whether holdouts on the bill got the president's message, Boebert said: “President Trump is speaking directly to many people individually.”
                





            Trump is meeting with House GOP members as key conservatives remain opposed to approving his sweeping tax and spending bill.
    


This post has been updated with comments from Boebert. 



            President Donald Trump on Tuesday argued that Republicans are “tremendously unified” despite party infighting over his sweeping budget and tax cuts bill.
    


                    “We have a tremendously unified party. I don't think we've ever had a party like this. There are some people who want a couple of things that maybe I don't like or that they're not going to get,” Trump said arriving on Capitol Hill to meet with the House Republican conference.
                





            He praised House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate GOP leader John Thune, adding that “we're a very unified party.”
    


                    “And we're going to have a bill, the one big, beautiful bill, I think it's going to be – It's the biggest bill ever passed, and we've got to get it done,” Trump said.
                





            He insisted that the bill would provide “the biggest tax cut in the history of our country” and that Republicans are “not changing” Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security, despite the proposal to add work requirements for Medicaid benefits.
    


            “We're not doing any cutting of anything meaningful. The only thing we're cutting is waste, fraud and abuse. With Medicaid, waste fraud and abuse,” he said.
    


            Before going behind closed doors to meet with the House Republican conference, Trump told reporters: “This is really just a pep talk.”
    


            The president acknowledged his tax and spending cuts bill would be amended but that it would move forward as GOP leadership plans to bring it to a vote in the House this week.
    


This post has been updated with more of Trump's remarks. 



            Conservative hardliner Rep. Thomas Massie called the White House's insistence that President Donald Trump's major policy bill would not raise the US deficit “a joke.”
    


            “No, that's a joke. That's a joke,” the Kentucky Republican told CNN while heading into the House GOP meeting that Trump is scheduled to attend.
    


                    “Is Russ Vought saying that? … OK, well, Russ Vought knows better. He's the OMB [Office of Management and Budget] director. I mean, over here, the people in favor of this bill say that under the policies of this bill, we're going to add $20 trillion to debt over the next 10 years, which is $3.5 to $5 trillion more than would have been added otherwise,” he said.
                





            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said yesterday that the sweeping bill aimed to advance Trump's legislative agenda “does not add to the deficit” — despite multiple nonpartisan reports that say otherwise.
    


            Asked if he's concerned about pressure on him to support the bill as it currently stands, Massie told CNN: “They wrote off my vote weeks ago.”
    


            Meanwhile, GOP Rep. Tim Burchett — who's not yet in support of the bill — told CNN that he's concerned about the bill's increase to the SALT tax deduction and wants to see “sufficient” work requirements for Medicaid benefits to “eliminate the fraud.”
    


            “I want to hear what the president has to say,” he said.
    


            House GOP leaders are hoping to pass President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” later this week and send it over to the Senate.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson has been engaging in last-ditch negotiations over several unresolved issues involving Medicaid, green energy tax credits and the state and local tax deduction.
    


Here are key things to know about what is in the bill: 



            • The package includes several controversial measures that would deeply cut into two of the nation's key safety net programs —Medicaid and food stamps — while making permanent essentially all of the trillions of dollars of individual income tax breaks contained in the GOP's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. What's more, it would fulfill Trump's campaign promises to cut taxes on tips and overtime, albeit temporarily.
    


            • The magnitude of the measures is evident in the estimates of the cost they'd incur or the savings they would produce. The tax package approved by the Ways and Means Committee carries a price tag of a little more than $3.8 trillion over 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Meanwhile, the Energy and Commerce plan, which contains contentious cuts to Medicaid, would reduce the deficit by at least $880 billion over a decade, according to an initial Congressional Budget Office analysis.
    


            • Republicans are aiming to make good on other Trump campaign promises, such as significant investments in staffing at the US southern border, new systems to discourage immigration into the US and a gigantic new missile defense shield. Then there are other longtime GOP policy goals, such as an overhaul of the nation's outdated air traffic system, new fees targeting electric cars and a pivot away from federal student loans.
    


            • Overall, the House is looking for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset the legislation's sweeping tax breaks and investments in defense and immigration control. The measures could still change before they are voted on by the full chamber, and Senate Republicans are likely to make additional changes even after the House passes the legislation.

            President Donald Trump has arrived on Capitol Hill, where he will meet with House Republicans Tuesday as they negotiate his sweeping tax and spending cuts package.
    


            Trump's visit to the Capitol comes as he aims to unite Republicans in pushing through his legislative agenda, which House Speaker Johnson hopes to pass by Memorial Day.
    


            This marks the sixth time that Trump has been on Capitol Hill this year for various engagements including a meeting with Republican senators during the transition period, his indoor Inauguration ceremony, the National Prayer Breakfast, Friends of Ireland luncheon and delivering an address to a joint session of Congress.
    


            Trump's motorcade departed from the North Lawn, without an opportunity for press to shout questions.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio plans to defend his overhaul of the State Department to lawmakers amid a proposed rescission of $20 billion in funding.
    


            Rubio is facing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday morning for the first time since his confirmation hearing. He will also testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee, the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Appropriations Committee over the next two days.
    


            Although he was unanimously confirmed as top US diplomat, some Democrats have since expressed regret and disappointment at Rubio's foreign policy stances as well as his overseeing of the destruction of the US Agency for International Development and sweeping changes at the State Department.
    


            According to his prepared opening statement, Rubio plans to argue that a proposed budget of $28.5 billion “will allow the Department to fulfill its mission while also proposing the rescission of $20 billion in duplicative, wasteful, and ideologically driven programs.” Such a proposal is tens of billions of dollars lower than past State Department budgets.
    


            Rubio plans to say that the budget reflects the State Department's reorganization, which includes a 15% staffing cut and has rattled the workforce.
    


                    “A core principle of this reorganization is the belief that what matters is not the size of budgets but the agility with which they can be deployed,” he will say, according to his prepared remarks.
                





            The top US diplomat will claim that the State Department has “found billions” in foreign aid awards “diverted to ideological causes, including climate activism, diversity, equity, inclusion, and LGBTQ initiatives in foreign nations.”
    


            As he has done in the past, he will applaud “the world's most talented diplomatic workforce,” but plans to say that “they deserve better.”
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that President Donald Trump will call on House Republicans “to get in line” to pass his legislative agenda this morning.
    


            Johnson said he had just gotten off the phone with Trump, who was on his way to Capitol Hill
    


                    “He's excited to talk to House republicans this morning, and we're excited to have him,” the speaker said.
                





            “This is a big week for his agenda, for all of us. we've been working on reconciliation for more than a year, as you all know, and it all comes down to these details,” Johnson said.
    


            “And I think the president is going to encourage everyone this morning to get in line and get the votes done. We need to deliver this to the American people, the America first agenda is all wrapped up in one big bill, and we're really excited to deliver it this morning so we're delighted.”
    


            Meanwhile, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said that Trump is “always the closer,” and the president wanted to come speak with everyone on Capitol Hill again.
    


            Scalise Pushed back on Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris' previous suggestion that Republicans delay debate on the current draft of the legislative bill further, saying GOP leadership's plan is still to hold a full House vote Wednesday or Thursday.
    


This post has been updated with reporting on Scalise's remarks.  



            As President Donald Trump trades the Oval Office for the halls of Congress today, his main priority is to urge his party to stop squabbling and make progress on moving a major piece of legislation that contains his core promises from the campaign trail, White House officials tell CNN.
    


            While House Republicans remain sharply divided over a number of sticking points in the $4 trillion bill, the reality from the president's point of view is that he has succeeded in getting what he wants in the package, the officials said.
    


            His campaign-driven goals to deliver sweeping tax cuts and no tax on tips and overtime pay are what Trump cares most about — the rest is simply negotiating to the finish line.
    


            Still, Trump has a monumental task before him to try and bring the factions of the party together. With a slim majority in the House leaving little room for detractors, his attempt to do so will be a major test of his dealmaking abilities.
    


            As of this morning, Trump had not directly engaged in whipping the vote of individual members, the officials said, though several of his aides have been closely involved in behind-the-scenes negotiations.
    


                    “The White House isn't freaking out yet,” one person close to Trump told CNN. “The president has been down this road before. He and the team understand that pushing through a bill of this size is going to take time. The key is starting the clock.”
                





            The White House officials said the president likely will not get into the specific, nitty-gritty details that are still being worked out.
    


            His main task is to ensure the House GOP understands the process of muscling this bill through begins in earnest.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson did not come to a resolution with members of the SALT (state and local tax) caucus last night, but members were promised more data in the morning and that talks will continue.
    


            “We are continuing to work on it. Not a final resolution yet but I think we are getting close,” Johnson told reporters following the roughly one-hour meeting late Monday evening.
    


            Following the meeting, New York Rep. Andrew Garbarino said leadership presented lawmakers with “proposals” to consider but they are seeking additional clarity and data.
    


                    “They hope to have some numbers back to us by the morning,” Garbarino added. “The speaker is doing everything he can to get us to yes and I think everybody in that room really appreciates the meeting.”
                





            Trump plans to make his pitch to Republicans at a meeting at the US Capitol today, CNN previously reported.
    


            Republican leadership is targeting a Wednesday or Thursday floor vote.
    


            When pressed on when the floor vote will be, Johnson maintained: “We'll have it before Memorial Day.”
    


What is the SALT caucus?: It's a loose coalition of roughly a half-dozen Republicans from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California who have sought to repeal the 2017 deduction cap on state and local taxes.
    


            US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke for two hours on the phone yesterday. It's the third known time the two leaders spoke since Trump was inaugurated in January and comes as he has grown increasingly frustrated with the Russian president's refusal to strike a peace deal with Ukraine.
    


            Before talking to Putin, Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
    


Here's what we know about developments after the Trump-Putin call:



What Putin said: The Russian president said the conversation with Trump was “frank and substantive,” and thanked him for US support in “resuming the direct talks between Russia and Ukraine,” according to Russia state news agency TASS. Putin also said Trump “expressed his position on the secession of hostilities, ceasefire, and from my end, I have emphasized that Russia stands for peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian crisis. We just need to outline the most effective routes of moving towards peace.” The two leaders did not discuss a timeframe for talks, a Kremlin spokesperson said.
    


What Trump said: “Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War,” Trump announced on Truth Social after his call. “The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of.” Trump also said that the “tone and spirit” of his conversation with Putin “were excellent,” and that “Russia wants to do largescale TRADE” with the US when the war is over.



Trump informs allies: Trump also said on Truth Social that after his call with Putin ended, he immediately informed the following leaders about the contents of the call after it ended: Zelensky, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Finnish President Alexander Stubb.
    


How Zelensky responded: Zelensky called for further sanctions on the Russian banking and energy sectors. He said a future location for a next round of talks — which would be aimed first at achieving a ceasefire — would be discussed. Zelensky also said Ukraine will not withdraw any of its troops from Russian-held regions of its country. Zelensky also said Russia was “trying to buy time” in negotiations in order to continue its war, after the call between Trump and Putin failed to extract concessions from the Russian leader.
    


US-Russia prisoner swap: Putin and Trump also discussed a US-Russia prisoner swap, involving nine people for nine others, Kremlin presidential aide Yury Ushakov said.
    


On the ground: Ukraine and Russia accused each other of launching attack drones on one another overnight, hours after Putin spoke by phone with Trump.
    


            President Donald Trump will make a personal pitch to House Republicans to pass his “big, beautiful bill” at a meeting at the Capitol today, according to four people familiar with the plans.
    


            Trump will deliver remarks at the House GOP conference meeting at 9 a.m. ET.
    


            It will be the first time Trump will speak in person with the full group of House Republicans since the conference began drafting the president's agenda.
    


What to know: House Republican leaders are still trying to resolve major internal battles over Trump's massive domestic policy bill even as Speaker Mike Johnson is engaged in last-ditch negotiations to win over GOP members' conflicting demands before an expected floor vote later this week.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum discusses the election of Pope Leo XIV, President Donald Trump's tariff policy and more on ‘The Story.'

EXCLUSIVE: The Trump administration has helped launch the first-ever U.S. mine for a critical mineral largely dominated by China, which controls about half of global production, Fox News Digital has learned.

The Idaho operation will extract and smelt antimony – a metalloid that is key to the U.S. defense and technology sectors – and reduce reliance on malign actors like the CCP – from which about half the world's stock is currently produced.

Antimony has a myriad of national security uses – including in military tools like night-vision goggles, explosives, flame-retardants, tracers, lasers, nuclear weapons production, military clothing and ammunition.

It also plays a role in the bloodless AI arms race, as a component in semiconductors and infrared technology, as well as its use increasing the hardness of alloys like lead and copper.

While not technically considered a rare earth element because of its placement on the periodic table, antimony is considered critical and less common than other elements.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum played a leading role in the groundbreaking effort to boost U.S. energy dominance and self-reliance in terms of critical minerals and natural resources.

The antimony stibnite mine will be used to mine for gold as well, Fox News Digital has learned.

The mine's opening is another example of a critical global supply chain shifting stateside, as Burgum and other officials aim to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign suppliers for national security and economic stability.

The National Energy Dominance Council, an executive branch advisory group founded in February by executive order and led by Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, was a key player in the opening of the mine.

Burgum issued the mine's 404 permit – which governs dredging and discharge into American waters -- on Thursday to Boise-based Perpetua Resources.

Perpetua President Jon Cherry called the achievement the culmination of eight years of study, refinement and "lots of hard work."

"We are immensely proud to achieve this milestone. It's time to move forward and take the Stibnite Gold Project into a new and exciting phase of development," Cherry said in a statement.

"We believe this [Trump] administration's commitment to boosting efficiency without compromising rigorous environmental standards can have a transformational impact on American mining," he added.

The project will also create 550 jobs and, on the gold front, is primed to produce more than 400,000 ounces of the precious metal annually over the next four years.

The antimony stores therein are estimated at 148 million pounds and are the only identified such reserve in the U.S. – and the largest outside China.

It is expected to cut foreign reliance on that critical mineral by one-third.

DHS shares new body camera video footage from the episode at Delaney Hall Detention Center.

The Department of Justice has accused Rep. LaMonica McIver of assaulting two federal agents at the Delaney Hall Detention Facility in New Jersey last month, according to a new charging document.

The document cites bodycam footage from law enforcement officers who recorded events as McIver and two other New Jersey lawmakers stormed the ICE facility. Prosecutors say the first officer McIver allegedly assaulted was a Homeland Security Investigations agent and the second was an ICE agent.

The DOJ accuses McIver of having "slammed her forearm into the body of a uniformed HSI agent and reached out and tried to restrain the agent by forcibly grabbing him."

The charging document also states that McIver "pushed an ICE officer & used her forearms to forcibly strike the agent."

McIver rejected the charges in a public statement, arguing they are "purely political."

"Earlier this month, I joined my colleagues to inspect the treatment of ICE detainees at Delaney Hall in my district," she wrote. "We were fulfilling our lawful oversight responsibilities, as members of Congress have done many times before, and our visit should have been peaceful and short. Instead, ICE agents created an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation when they chose to arrest Mayor Baraka."

"The charges against me are purely political – they mischaracterize and distort my actions, and are meant to criminalize and deter legislative oversight," she continued. "This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right. I am thankful for the outpouring of support I have received and I look forward to the truth being laid our clearly in court."

Prosecutors say McIver helped create a "human shield" and blocked agents from handcuffing Newark Mayor Ras Baraka after he ignored numerous warnings to leave the property and was told he would be arrested.

When the HSI agent told the mayor he was going to arrest him, McIver interjected and yelled "Hell no! Hell no! Hell no!" according to the charging document.

The HSI agent then ordered Baraka to put his hands behind his back and displayed his handcuffs. McIver and other members of Congress "surrounded the Mayor and prevented HSI from handcuffing him and taking him into custody," prosecutors say.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem weighed in on the charges against McIver on Monday, saying, "no one is above the law."

"If any person, regardless of political party, influence or status, assaults a law enforcement officer as we witnessed Congresswoman McIver do, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law," the secretary wrote. "We thank our brave ICE law enforcement officers for their service to this great nation."

President Donald Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, where he suggested that failure to pass his “big, beautiful” tax bill could cost Republicans their House of Representatives majority in the 2026 midterm elections.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and GOP lawmakers held a late-night vote on Sunday to advance the bill out of the Budget Committee, but fiscal hawks have voiced concerns about the bill's impact on the national deficit ahead of a possible floor vote as early as Wednesday.

Trump briefly spoke with reporters on the Hill before delivering remarks in support of the bill to the full House Republican Conference, claiming that the GOP had been “one heart attack away from losing the House” due to earlier slimmer majorities before the Florida special House elections. 

Now, with two Democratic vacancies due to the deaths of Reps. Sylvester Turner (D-TX) and Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), Republicans have a 220-213 advantage, meaning Johnson can afford to lose just three votes to pass legislation along party lines.

“We're going to have a bill, the One Big, Beautiful Bill. I think it's going to be the biggest bill ever passed, and we got to get it done,” he stated, noting that a few Republican maybes will “grandstand” before final votes, even if failing to extend his 2017 tax cuts would result in a tax increase on more than two-thirds of households.

“Look, the alternative is a 68% tax increase, and you can blame the Democrats for that, and one or two grandstanders,” the president said. “Or, you'll get a massive tax increase — you'll get a tax cut the likes of which we've never had before. This is bigger than any Ronald Reagan tax cut.”

Trump declared that any GOP lawmakers voting against the bill “wouldn't be a Republican for much longer. They would be knocked out so fast.” 

“I'm a cheerleader for this party, and I'm a cheerleader for the country — much more importantly for the country — but I'm a cheerleader for the party, and we're going to go up, and I think we're going to have a very good discussion,” he explained.

Trump singled out Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), a fiscal conservative who traditionally votes no on spending matters, saying he “should be voted out of office.” Massie opposes Trump's bill.  

National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Richard Hudson (R-NC) said the House GOP's campaign arm will stick to its longstanding policy of not spending money in primary elections, meaning they won't rescue incumbents facing possible Trump-backed challengers. 

“We don't do primaries,” Hudson told Axios. 

Trump's beefed-up tax cuts mark Republicans' first true legislative test of the president's second term in office, but Johnson has been saddled with wrangling opposing wings of the Republican Party, one that wants to see more deficit reducing measures included in the bill and the other is pushing for boosted tax benefits for their own constituencies.

And though the bill has been slow-rolled through the early months of Trump's term, the president praised the speaker Tuesday morning.

“I'm his biggest fan. I love this guy,” he declared, standing shoulder to shoulder with Johnson. “I don't think there's anybody that's more well-suited to be speaker of the House, especially in a case like this.”

Forecasters warned Monday that more tornados and storms were possible in the central U.S. as people from Texas to Kentucky cleaned up from severe weather that has killed more than two dozen people in four days.



























WASHINGTON (AP) — As nasty tornadoes popped up from Kansas to Kentucky, a depleted National Weather Service was in scramble mode.

The agency's office in Jackson, Kentucky, had begun closing nightly as deep cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency began hitting. But the weather service kept staffers on overtime Friday night to stay on top of the deadly storms, which killed nearly 20 people in the Jackson office's forecast area.

It's a scenario likely to be repeated as the U.S. is on track to see more tornadoes this year than in 2024, which was the second-busiest tornado year on record. Forecasters said there was at least a 10% risk of tornadoes Tuesday for 10.6 million people in parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Weather service veterans expressed concern about the agency's ability to keep up in the face of the cuts.

Rich Thompson, lead operations forecaster at the NWS Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, said the job is getting done. But he acknowledged that staffing cuts have “made it harder on us.”

“It has made it hard on the local offices just to make sure that we have all of our important duties covered. But, I mean, most of the people take those important duties seriously, so we're going to do what it takes to cover it,” Thompson said. “I hope we're not in the same staffing situation long term. ... It would be hard to sustain this for months or years.”

NWS spokesperson Erica Grow Cei said the Jackson office “remained fully staffed through the duration of the event using surge staffing” and had support from neighboring offices.

The Storm Prediction Center had tallied 883 local tornado reports this year as of Monday, which was 35% higher than average for this time of year. 




Many former weather service employees, especially those fired by the Trump administration, remain connected to the agency's inner workings. They describe an agency that's somehow getting forecasts and warnings out in time, but is also near the breaking point.

“They'll continue to answer the bell as long as they can, but you can only ask people to work 80 hours or 120 hours a week, you know for so long,” said Elbert “Joe” Friday, a former weather service director. “They may be so bleary-eyed, they can't identify what's going on on the radar.”

Tom DiLiberto, a weather service meteorologist and spokesman who was fired in earlier rounds of the job cuts, said the situation is like a boat with leaks “and you have a certain amount of pieces of duct tape and you keep moving duct tape to different holes. At some point, you can't.”

Forecasters warned Monday that more tornados and storms were possible in the central U.S. as people from Texas to Kentucky cleaned up from severe weather that has killed more than two dozen people in four days.

As of March, some of the weather service offices issuing tornado warnings Friday and Sunday were above the 20% vacancy levels that outside experts have said is a critical threshold. Those include Jackson, with a 25% vacancy rate, Louisville, Kentucky, with a 29% vacancy rate, and Wichita, Kansas, with a 32% vacancy rate, according to data compiled by weather service employees and obtained by the AP.

Technologies used to predict tornadoes have significantly improved, but radar can't replace a well-rested staff that has to figure out how nasty or long-lasting storms will be and how to get information to the public, said Karen Kosiba, managing director of the Flexible Array of Mesonets and Radars (FARM) facility, a network of weather equipment used for research.

“There really are not enough people to handle everything,” said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Howard Bluestein, who chased six tornadoes Sunday. “If the station is understaffed, that could affect the quality of forecasts.”

Former weather service Director Louis Uccellini said budget cuts have drastically reduced the number of weather balloon launches, which provide critical information for forecasts. And weather service workers aren't being allowed to travel to help train local disaster officials for what to do when they get dangerous weather warnings, he said.

Though the number of tornadoes is nearly at a record pace, Thompson and other experts said the tornado outbreak of the last few days is mostly normal for this time of year. 

For tornadoes to form, the atmosphere needs a collision of warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and storm systems chugging through via the jet stream, the river of air that brings weather fronts from west to east, said Thompson, Bluestein and Harold Brooks of the weather service's National Severe Storm Laboratory.

“The moisture that we're getting from the Gulf of Mexico is a lot more than we used to get,” said Bluestein. “That makes the likelihood that we're getting a stronger storm higher and that's pretty unusual.”

Temperatures in the Gulf are a couple of degrees warmer than usual for this time of year, according to the weather service.

The connection between climate change and tornadoes is not as well understood as the links between other types of extreme weather such as heavy rainfall and heat waves, experts say.

“Under the climate change scenario, we're kind of supercharging the atmosphere on some days and then actually reducing the favorability on others,” said Ohio State University atmospheric sciences professor Jana Houser. 

Scientists are also seeing more tornadoes in January, February, March and other times when it used to be too cold for twisters to form, especially in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee, she said.

More people are also living in harm's way, Brooks said. That's why Uccellini and others see increasing risks to people and property.

“When you have this kind of threat and you're understaffed at some point, something's going to slip through the cracks,” Uccellini said. “I can't tell you when it's going to happen.”

            Increasing the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction could benefit millions of tax filers.
    


            But a proposal to do just that has become a point of contention and a possible roadblock to House Republicans' passing “one big, beautiful bill” that reflects President Donald Trump's agenda. That agenda includes making permanent essentially all of the individual income tax provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which are otherwise scheduled to expire this year.
    


            The SALT deduction, as it is known, enables federal income tax filers to deduct either their state and local income taxes or their state and local general sales taxes. In addition, they are also allowed to deduct their property taxes, assuming their income or sales taxes don't put them over the cap. The tax break, however, may only be taken by those who itemize deductions on their federal returns, which only a minority of filers do.

Trump to personally appeal to lawmakers as major sticking points remain unresolved on his ‘one big, beautiful' agenda bill



            Prior to 2017, there was no limit on the SALT deduction.
    


            But the TCJA imposed a $10,000 cap — which, when coupled with the expanded standard deduction under that tax law, meant the number of people who claimed the SALT deduction fell dramatically — from about one-quarter of filers in 2017, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, to less than 10% today.
    


            Going forward, it appears there will still be a cap, but it likely will be higher than $10,000. The question is just how much higher and for whom?
    


            The House Ways and Means and House Budget committees already approved a tax package that would permanently raise the cap to $30,000 for any taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income is $400,000 or less if married filing jointly (and $200,000 or less for single filers). But anyone above those income thresholds would still be able to deduct at least $10,000, according to the Tax Foundation.
    


            The expectation, however, is that the cap will have to be higher than $30,000 to garner needed votes by a small group of House Republicans.
    


            Republicans introduced the cap as part of their 2017 tax cuts bill to help pay for the sweeping legislation. And they are hoping to use it again as a revenue raiser in this year's package.
    


            For example, the $30,000 cap proposal, which is expected to ﻿be amended before the House bill goes to the floor for a vote as early as Thursday, is estimated to raise $915.6 billion over 10 years relative to simply letting the cap expire as it is otherwise set to do if lawmakers don't act, according to estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation.

            But GOP lawmakers from high-tax blue states, such as California and New York, are demanding greater relief for their constituents, who are disproportionately affected by the lower cap.
    


            This has sparked intraparty battles with their colleagues from lower-tax red states, whose residents don't benefit from the deduction nearly as much.
    


            It's hardly the first time SALT has been the subject of dispute in modern times, said tax historian Joe Thorndike.
    


            The SALT break has been on the books since 1913, when the federal income tax code was created. It also had a decade-long stint during the Civil War as well.
    


            But there have been efforts to limit the deduction over the past five decades. While originally the SALT deduction was created so that the federal government didn't encroach upon states' ability to collect revenue, SALT today is portrayed as a subsidy to high-tax states and as regressive in that it disproportionately benefits higher-income households, Thorndike noted.
    


            In 2020, the SALT deduction was claimed on just 8.6% of all federal tax returns, according to the Tax Policy Center.
    


            But the incidence of people claiming it was most concentrated in 13 states and the District of Columbia.
    


            The deduction was claimed on more than 20% of returns from Maryland and Washington, DC; and on 10% to 20% of returns filed by residents of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Utah, Virginia and Washington State.
    


            And those who have received the biggest break — both before and after the cap was imposed — are high-income filers, especially those in high-tax states and cities.
    


            In 2017, before the cap went into effect, for example, roughly two-thirds of the benefit went to those with incomes of $200,000 or more, according to the center. The average SALT deduction was about $13,000, but it topped $30,000 in eight counties, mostly in California and New York.
    


            While the vast majority of middle- and upper-income households received tax relief from TCJA regardless of where they lived, they would have received even more, had the cap not been instituted, said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the TPC.
    


            For example, the tax cut for those in the top 20% would have been $2,500 larger, on average, had their state and local tax deductions not been limited, according to the center. Their average individual income tax cut was only about $6,200, instead of $8,700.
    


            The cap had an even greater impact on taxpayers in the top 1%, whose average tax cut was $40,100, instead of $71,000.
    


            But those in the bottom 80% would not have seen much of a change in the size of their tax cut had the cap not been put in place.

The J.C. Ames tugboat, sunk in 1923, was recently found in the waters of Lake Michigan near Manitowoc, Wisconsin. (Source: Wisconsin Historical Society)

A long-lost shipwreck sitting in the waters of Lake Michigan was recently discovered by a fisherman – to the surprise of local officials.

The Wisconsin Historical Society announced the discovery on May 16. The tugboat, which was called the J.C. Ames, was built for the lumber trade in 1881. It was intentionally sunk in 1923.

The angler, Christopher Thuss, discovered the ship on a foggy day near the coast of Manitowoc, where it was sitting nine feet below the lake's surface. After spotting the shipwreck, he reported the find to officials.

ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER CENTURIES-OLD SHIPWRECK BENEATH HISTORIC CITY: 'UNIQUE SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE'

"These kinds of discoveries are always so exciting because it allows a piece of lost history to resurface," Tamara Thomsen, a maritime archaeologist at the Wisconsin Historical Society, said in a statement. "It sat there for over 100 years and then came back on our radar completely by chance."

Thomsen added, "We are grateful that Chris Thuss noticed the wreck and reported it so we can share this story with the Wisconsin communities that this history belongs to."

The J.C. Ames cost $50,000 to build. It was "one of the largest and most powerful tugs on the lakes," according to officials. 

It was damaged in a collision in 1889, but was repaired and changed owners several times before it was discarded.

ARCHAEOLOGIST SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON ASTONISHING DISCOVERY OF WRECKED SLAVE SHIPS: 'STRANDED ON THE COAST'

Thomsen told Fox News Digital the ship had "outlived its usefulness" by the time that it was intentionally sunk.

"Abandoning ships that had outlived their use was how it was done back in the day."

"[The ship] was dismantled at Manitowoc with its engine/boiler removed, towed outside the harbor, burned and abandoned in 1923," the historian explained.

She added, "Abandoning ships that had outlived their use was how it was done back in the day."

Divers found small artifacts near the wreck of the tugboat, which sank in the 1920s. (Wisconsin Historical Society)

Thomsen also noted that it became somewhat of a spectacle for the ships to be set on fire while they were dismantled.

"They set fire to them and people came out to watch," the expert said.

Thomsen also estimates that 13 ships were abandoned in the Maritime Bay near Manitowoc. Divers have only been able to locate three, but they're still keeping their eyes peeled for them.

"We only find them when they are uncovered by storms if someone sees them before they are covered again – it needs to be perfect timing," she said.

The maritime archaeologist also noted that a large propeller, measuring 10.5 feet in diameter, still sits at the shipwreck site. 

Other than that, only small artifacts were found.

The find is especially remarkable because Thuss's step-grandmother garnered a reputation for finding shipwrecks herself, according to the Wisconsin Historical Society.

"'Shipwreck Suzze' Johnson, who took up the hobbies of operating a powered parachute and ultralight plane as a retiree, has incredibly discovered a variety of shipwrecks from the air in the recent past, including three shipwrecks in three days in Lake Michigan in 2015," the historical organization said.

Last May, the Wisconsin Historical Society identified 11 ancient canoes in a Madison lake, including one boat that dated back to 2500 B.C.

Later that year, the organization announced the discovery of the John Evenson, a tugboat built in 1884 that was also discovered in Lake Michigan.

Iain Banks's Culture novels take place in a socialist utopia. The broligarchs love them.

by  Constance Grady

One of the most momentous developments of the new Trump era is how major billionaires in the tech industry — frequently known as the broligarchs — have thrown their weight behind the president. During the 2024 election, they offered high-profile support and made big donations; after the inauguration, they announced new company policies that aligned them with President Donald Trump's regressive cultural ideologies. 

Elon Musk had already turned Twitter into a right-wing echo chamber since purchasing it in 2022, and spent several chaotic months earlier this year as Trump's government efficiency henchman. Jeff Bezos has revamped the Washington Post's editorial section to build support for “personal liberties and free markets.” Mark Zuckerberg decided to get rid of fact-checkers at Meta. 

It was a massive show of power that revealed how possible it is for these wealthy men to remake our culture in their own image, transforming how we speak to each other and what we know to be true. Using that power on Trump's behalf seems to have paid mixed dividends for Silicon Valley, but it nonetheless makes clear how important it is to understand their worldview and their vision for the future. 

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Which is why it is striking to note that Musk, Bezos, and Zuckerberg share a favorite author: Iain M. Banks, the Scottish science fiction writer best known for his Culture series. Banks is an odd choice for a bunch of tech billionaires. The author, who died in 2013, was a socialist and avowed hater of the super-rich.

“The Culture series is certainly, in terms of more modern science fiction, one of my absolute favorites,” Bezos told GeekWire in 2018, adding, “there's a utopian element to it that I find very attractive.” Bezos has attempted twice to adapt the series for TV at Amazon, once in 2018 and again in February. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg picked the Culture novel Player of Games for his book club in 2015. 

Banks is an odd choice for a bunch of tech billionaires. The author, who died in 2013, was a socialist and avowed hater of the super-rich.

The most avowed Culture fan among the broligarchs, however, is Musk. Musk has named Space X drone ships after the starships in the Culture books. His original name for the neuralink — a computer chip that can be implanted in human brains, pioneered by his neurotechnology company — was the neural lace, a piece of telepathic technology that Banks came up with in the Culture books. In 2018, Musk declared himself “a utopian anarchist of the kind best described by Iain Banks.” (It's worth noting that in 2018, Musk was under fire for union busting but had not yet waded so far into national politics or declared public war against the “woke mind virus.”)

Plenty of us like and even identify with pieces of pop culture whose politics we don't entirely agree with, like the libertarian Little House on the Prairie books or the Christian Chronicles of Narnia. Still, the Banks Culture series, which consists of 10 books released between 1987 and 2012, is not politically coded so much as it is downright didactic. “The Culture is hippy commies with hyper-weapons and a deep distrust of both Marketolatry and Greedism,” Banks said in an interview with Strange Horizons in 2010, in a line that's only barely more explicit than the books themselves.

The Culture series takes place in a post-scarcity galactic society known only as the Culture, which strictly values empathy, pluralism, and social cooperation. Most of the volumes of the series see the Culture navigating an altercation with another civilization, usually one with a much less progressive ethos, and figuring out how to handle the resulting tension. Does the Culture intervene in the affairs of another planet to, for instance, stop the spread of a theocratic empire? What does it do about civilizations where slavery is legal?

The politics of these books are not subtle, and they are also not compatible with the existence of billionaires. So it's worth thinking about why the broligarchs have so consistently cited a socialist author as an inspiration. What do they find tantalizing about Banks' work? Are they missing the point altogether? 

Nearly every aspect of the Culture seems to be diametrically opposed to the worldview of the tech right.

Banks takes as his starting principle for the Culture the idea that a space-faring civilization will have to be socialist to be effective. In the hostile environment of the vacuum of space, he argues, you will need to be able to count on the collective. Banks further reasons that each spaceship or planet in the Culture will have to be reasonably self-sufficient to survive. 

At the same time, the Culture is stringently non-hierarchical and non-individualistic. There is no money and no want; therefore, there can't be any billionaires or any economic inequality. There are no laws and almost no crime. This is not a world in which supremely wealthy people who use their power to influence the social fabric make sense. 

“Succinctly; socialism within, anarchy without,” Banks concluded in a 1994 Usenet post in which he lays out his full theory of the Culture. 

In the Culture, should someone commit an action that most people agreed was unacceptable, everyone responds with social shaming rather than the rule of law: They stop inviting the person in question to parties. In other words, like a group of proper leftists, they deal with misbehavior by social cancellation, that great threat against which the broligarchs have declared war.

Even work-life balance in the Culture exists in opposition to the ethos of Silicon Valley. The Culture's citizens have invented vastly powerful AIs that take care of governance for them. This delegation frees up the Culture citizens themselves to indulge in what Banks describes as “the things that really mattered in life, such as sports, games, romance, studying dead languages, barbarian societies and impossible problems, and climbing high mountains without the aid of a safety harness.” Those who are burdened with too much ambition to be content in such a soft life take on (unpaid) jobs managing the Culture's relationships with other civilizations, mostly for the prestige and the adrenaline rush of it all. 

This vision appears to have influenced Musk's idea of a future in which AI has rendered work “optional,” so that “if you want to do a job that's kinda like a hobby, you can do a job.” Musk allows that there would need to be “universal high income” for this plan to work, but outlines no ideas as to how such an ambitious policy could take effect. In the meantime, in our own world, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla are all infamous for requiring employees to work abusively long hours. 

Finally, and perhaps most discordantly given the broligarchs' current gender politics, the Culture is genderfluid. Anyone can change gender just by thinking about it, and most people do at least once in their lives, a state of affairs Banks argues is responsible for its strict regime of gender equality. Meanwhile, Musk is notoriously anti-trans, Zuckerberg has been leaning into the retrograde gender ideologies of the manosphere as he tweaks Meta's policies to allow more hate speech, particularly toward LGBTQ+ people, and Amazon has removed LGBTQ+ rights support from its website.

But it's not just that the Culture holds the inverse of the ideology these men stand for. The most detestable villain in Banks's series is Joiler Veppers, a wealthy man in a civilization less evolved than the Culture, who uses his riches to purchase and influence media outlets, undercut labor unions, and rape his indentured servants. Veppers's money comes from a family fortune built in the computer game industry, and he compounds that fortune by investing in the servers to a series of virtual reality hellscapes, where unfortunates are horribly tortured for all eternity.

If you want to know how Banks views capitalist tech billionaires, you don't have to hunt very hard. In the Culture series, a capitalist tech billionaire is the literal devil, only he couldn't be bothered to build hell himself. 

So what's the appeal of the Culture series if you actually are a capitalist tech billionaire? Probably the tech itself.

If politics offer the Culture books their intellectual framing, the tech is what gives them their zing, their spectacle. Throughout the series, Banks lovingly describes spaceships and AIs (and lots of spaceships that are also AIs), and artificial planets and gizmos and gadgets. Generally, at the end of the book, the Culture uses one of those gizmos in an inventive way to win a big, explosive space war. 

Read through this light, the Culture's technological prowess offers the brute force that backs up its warm and fuzzy ideology. The Culture can afford to be idealistic and worry about its moral culpability because it has better technology than all the other civilizations it faces off with, which means it will nearly always win in a fight.

If you think of yourself as a titan of industry who is making that technology for your own culture — who is providing the brute force that allows for wishy-washy moralizing — there is a certain easy comfort that comes with this alignment. You know you are on the correct side of history because you're on the side that is building the strongest and most advanced technology. 

Yet within the larger metaphor Banks is building, the relationship between politics and strength is supposed to be the other way around. The Culture is not good because they are strong. Their strength is a metaphor for their goodness. They have the best technology because that shows that they are rational, that they value intelligence, that they are motivated to give their citizens the best possible quality of life. 

 The Culture is not good because they are strong. Their strength is a metaphor for their goodness.

To avoid this idea when reading Banks, you would have to be exquisitely attuned to the pleasurable spectacle of technology and the power that tech offers its users, and then ignore everything else. In that case, what the broligarchs' love of the Culture series reveals is that they see the world through the lens of power and spectacle first and foremost, and have no particular problem evading the work's deeper meaning. That's why this group has a propensity for big, pointless stunts, like trips to almost-space and carting a kitchen sink through Twitter headquarters and threatening to punch one another in a public fight. It's as though they feel entitled to their power because their favorite book taught them that the side with the best tech always wins, and the most important thing you can do with that tech is put on a show. They seem not to have read deeply enough to understand what the book was really trying to say: that the most important thing powerful people can do is use their power to make the world freer, fairer, and more pleasurable for everyone else.

President Donald Trump gives an update on the 'big beautiful' budget bill as he touts early wins of his presidency.

President Donald Trump delivered a "pep talk" to Republicans on Capitol Hill on Tuesday in an effort to pass his "big, beautiful bill."

Trump's visit found House Republicans split between spending-hawk holdouts who wanted to cut more of the deficit and moderates who sought to expand tax deductions for Americans. Trump himself has pushed tax cuts and emphasized on Tuesday that he only seeks to cut "waste, fraud and abuse" from Medicaid.

"We're not touching anything. All I want is one thing. Three words. We don't want any waste, fraud, or abuse," Trump said ahead of the meeting. "Very simple. Waste, fraud, abuse. Other than that, we're leaving it, Medicare. We're leaving it all."

Trump was extremely complimentary of House Speaker Mike Johnson as he spoke to reporters ahead of the House Republicans' weekly meeting on the Hill. It is not clear whether Trump will meet with individual holdouts directly.

"We have a very, very united party. This man has done a fantastic job. It's only been recently, but this man has done a fantastic job. He's a real unifier," Trump said of Johnson, who stood beside him.

"I don't think anybody else could have done it. We had – I just said to your cohorts downstairs, we had a majority of one for a period of was and he gets it together and we actually cast this and nobody else came," he told reporters. "He's done a fantastic job, the Speaker. We have a very, very unified party."

Trump told reporters after the meeting that it had been a "meeting of love" and rejected reports that he is losing patience.

"I think it was really great. That was a meeting of love, let me tell you. That was love in that room. There was no shouting. I think it was a meeting of love," he said.

If the legislation passes through the House, it will face another – perhaps tougher – battle in the Senate, where some lawmakers have floated breaking up the bill to pass certain priorities more quickly.

Meanwhile, Democrats argue the legislation is a handout for the wealthiest Americans.

"They literally are trying to take health care away from millions of Americans at this very moment in the dead of night," House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Monday.

"If this legislation is designed to make life better for the American people, can someone explain to me why they would hold a hearing to advance the bill at 1 a.m. in the morning?" he added.

Many Democrats are saying now is not the time to discuss former President Joe Biden's health while in office in the wake of his prostate cancer diagnosis.

The news that Biden is suffering from an aggressive form of cancer that has already spread to his bones came as yet another book about his condition as president hit the shelves, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again by Jake Tapper of CNN and Alex Thompson of Axios.

Top Democratic strategist David Axelrod said “conversations” about Biden's health and mental acuity as president “should be more muted and set aside for now as he's struggling through this.”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) was more pointed in his response to whether Biden's cancer diagnosis raised new questions about his ability to serve or transparency regarding the former president's medical condition.

“It seems to me entirely inappropriate that at this moment in time when President Biden is dealing with a serious and aggressive form of cancer, there are Republicans who are peddling conspiracy theories and want us to look backward at a time when they actually are taking health care away from the American people,” Jeffries told reporters. 

“Maybe let's not play partisan games with a cancer diagnosis, okay?” posted Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist and former Vice President Kamala Harris‘s adviser, in response to those wondering if Biden's latest health scare was similar in nature to what has been reported in books such as Original Sin.

When Vice President JD Vance wished Biden well but questioned whether this was another example of the former president's health receiving insufficient scrutiny, Politico's Jonathan Martin described it as “a real-time depiction of somebody struggling between the responsibilities of high office and the temptations that come with being totally online.”    

President Donald Trump has also called Biden's diagnosis “very sad” while expressing skepticism about the timeline. 

It is possible that Biden's prostate cancer is wholly unrelated to the problems that led voters to increasingly question his ability to continue as president as his term wore on, with Democrats nudging him aside after he struggled in a presidential debate with Trump on June 27, 2024.

But knowing what we know now about the extent of Biden's age-related decline and his team's efforts to conceal it from the public, questions about this sudden diagnosis of an advanced cancer that apparently went undetected while in office seem valid.

The dismissal of all Biden age-related questions as partisan talking points or conservative disinformation was a big part of why the media got the story so wrong, and many Democrats were caught flatfooted by his debate performance. 

If Democratic elites had listened to their party's rank-and-file voters, who told pollsters they wanted another option in 2024, they would not have been sent scrambling in the weeks following that debate. If journalists had not been so eager to accept the “cheap fakes” explanation for video footage of seemingly bad Biden outings, they wouldn't be writing mea culpas about their Biden age and health coverage months after he left office.

The new Biden books aren't being written by conservatives or partisan Republicans. Before Tapper and Thompson, one came from Tyler Pager of the New York Times, Josh Dawsey of the Wall Street Journal, and Isaac Arnsdorf of the Washington Post. It's also a big part of another book written by Jonathan Allen of NBC News and Amie Parnes of the Hill.

Some of these books are even sympathetic to Democratic political interests. For whom was Biden's decision to seek reelection “disastrous,” if not the Democrats?

The latest devastating health news for Biden should be handled sensitively and compassionately. People should fervently hope he makes a full recovery.

But if the point of all fresh reporting on Biden is to help learn from past mistakes, the answer cannot be to ignore new questions or change the subject. 

“Whether the right time to have this conversation is now or at some point in the future,” is how Vance prefaced his comments to reporters.

WHO WAS FOOLED BY THE BIDEN DECLINE COVER-UP? NOT THE VOTERS 

“We really do need to be honest about whether the former president was capable of doing the job,” he said.

Hopefully, that conversation will happen before new books lamenting old Biden coverage decisions are published years from now.

            After the United States lost its last perfect credit rating on Friday, Republicans and Democrats responded by pointing fingers at each other.
    


            Moody's Ratings said problematic debt levels far outpacing government revenue led to the downgrade. Now, it's up to lawmakers on both sides to take actions to improve the nation's fiscal situation, or another downgrade could be in the cards. And that one would likely be even more painful.
    


            Yet, days later, House Republicans on the Budget Committee voted to advance a sweeping legislative agenda that could worsen the fiscal picture, adding over $1 trillion to annual deficits by 2034 compared to 2024, according to preliminary estimates from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
    


            However, it's far from a done deal, as it faces a slew of hurdles in both chambers of Congress despite Republicans having a majority. Even Trump administration officials have suggested the agenda, dubbed the “one, big, beautiful bill,” could be modified to get it to the finish line.

            But some Trump administration officials insist the agenda, which calls for trillions of dollars in tax cuts that exceed a wide array of spending cuts, won't add to the nation's budget deficit, the gap between what the government collects in revenue versus how much it spends. That difference is financed by borrowing money from people who invest in US bonds and Treasuries, which pay a varying amount of interest, also known as the yield.
    


            For instance, White House Council of Economic Advisers Chair Stephen Miran said in a CNBC interview on Monday that efforts included in the bill to “cut waste, fraud and abuse are going to end up bringing the deficit down by almost half a point of GDP, or maybe even a little bit more than that.”
    


            Earlier in the day, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, “This bill does not add to the deficit.”
    


            Had Moody's not downgraded US debt two days prior, Republican lawmakers in particular may have been more willing to take such comments at face value. But now, with the fiscal situation back in the spotlight, more diligence could be warranted.
    


            “Moody's downgrade reflects concerns stemming from years of bad fiscal decisions in Washington,” Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peter Peterson Foundation, which advocates for America's fiscal stability, told CNN. The country already is on track to add $22 trillion more to the $36 trillion debt level over the next decade, he said. President Donald Trump's bill “would only accelerate the pace of borrowing by adding trillions to this already unsustainable path.”
    


            On Monday, investors took note of the risks Moody's outlined in explaining its decision to downgrade US debt to one notch below perfect. Key to that was “the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,” Moody's said in its Friday statement.
    


            Yields on 30-year US bonds soared by over a percentage point, touching 5% at one point on Monday, while yields on shorter-term debt held by the US government also rose. Both point to the same message: The risks of investing in American debt, long considered the safest asset, have grown.

            Consumers, just like the government, tend to have to pay more to borrow money when yields rise since banks and other lenders often base interest rates on US Treasury and bond yields.
    


            “With our divisive politics preventing progress, it's no surprise that financial markets are watching — and increasingly worried,” Peterson added.
    


            Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, similarly alluded to rising yields on US debt as a wake-up call for lawmakers. “The government deficit isn't a problem until investors think it is. And they're increasingly telling us that the deficit is a problem,” Cox said in a note on Monday.
    


            Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said the downgrade increases the odds that Trump's package, if passed, will carry fewer tax cuts than what's currently being proposed to minimize the deficit impact.
    


            “The downgrade will catch the attention of the fiscal hawks and make it unlikely that some of the proposed features, including no taxes on overtime and an enhanced standard deduction for seniors aged 65 and older that are not in our baseline, will be included in the fiscal package,” he said in a note on Monday.
    


            Sweet also said the downgrade will likely extend the length of time it takes to pass the bill, if at all. Meanwhile, top Trump administration officials, including National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, say they're optimistic it'll pass by the middle of this summer.

The ambitious deadline set by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) to pass the “one big, beautiful” reconciliation bill by Memorial Day is up against the reality that House Republicans haven't locked in the votes.

President Donald Trump, who has already bashed “grandstanders” holding up the bill, will head to Capitol Hill on Tuesday morning to speak at the House Republicans' weekly conference meeting, a sign that leadership is putting pressure on holdouts. After meeting with the whole conference, the White House staff is reportedly holding meetings with holdouts on Capitol Hill. 

The tax cut legislation hinges on votes from fiscal hawks and the SALT Caucus, who want changes on key provisions before backing the marquee GOP legislation.

With just three votes to spare in his slim Republican majority, Johnson has little time to get the reconciliation legislation on the floor for a House-wide vote by Thursday or Wednesday at the earliest. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act calls for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset extending Trump's 2017 tax breaks.  

Though 95% of the bill is done and ready for a full House vote, Republican leadership staff told reporters on Monday morning that there are still “ongoing conversations” about the remaining 5%, which includes raising the state and local tax (SALT) cap, Medicaid work requirements, and repealing portions of the Inflation Reduction Act.

The Rules Committee is scheduled to meet at 1 a.m. on Wednesday to discuss alterations to the legislation, the product of a handshake agreement between leadership and fiscal hawks to pass the bill of the Budget Committee on Sunday.

“We're almost there, and I'm very optimistic that we will find the right equilibrium point to get this bill delivered,” Johnson said on Monday afternoon. “It's going to be a big thing for the country.”

GOP leadership aides did not provide any specific details as to what was in the handshake agreement, but Reps. Chip Roy (R-TX) and Ralph Norman (R-SC) said on Sunday night that they had made progress with moving up both the effective date of the Medicaid work requirements and the date of repeal of several IRA clean energy tax credits. 

Originally, the work requirements were set to kick in 2029, though Johnson said there is broad support from most of the GOP to move up the start date; it's just a matter of feasibility. Aides characterized the fight over Medicaid as “push and pull conversations.”  

In the manager's amendment, which allows for alterations to the reconciliation bill, the new effective date for Medicaid work requirements is December 2026.

“I think it's the desire of every Republican, always has been, to make work requirements real and actionable as soon as possible,” the speaker said Sunday. “We learned in the process that some of the states needed a longer lag time to add in the implementation of the new policy. So we're going to … make it happen sooner, as soon as possible. And I think that's a good change in the policy.”

SALT Republicans are also holding up the process, as they want to see the cap raised from the proposed increase to $30,000. Johnson was optimistic last week that they would be able to reach an agreement on SALT over the weekend, but GOP leadership aides said Monday that there are still “unsolved issues” to iron out.

The SALT caucus met with leadership at 9 p.m. on Monday, with Rep. Nick LaLota (R-NY) telling reporters he was hoping to be presented with a deal he could accept. The proposed $40,000/$80,000 caps for single and married filers were a nonstarter, as LaLota called the sunset in a few years to the current $10,000 cap a “poison pill.”

The New York Republican expressed disappointment with the close crunch time.

“I would've preferred that we'd handled this two months ago … This was on everyone's radar for a couple of years now,” LaLota said. “That it's coming down to the last minute is unfortunate, but I think we'll get through it.” 

Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY), another SALT Republican, agreed that the debate over SALT should have “been dealt with months ago.” He said it “certainly appears” that leadership took the SALT Republicans for granted and “that they felt they could just jam us.”

Lawler also scoffed at Freedom Caucus members who have said the SALT caucus is asking for too much, stating, “Good luck getting what they want.”

“We wouldn't even be in this position right now if you didn't have members in seats like mine, who won,” Lawler said. “And so if they think we're going to throw our constituents under the bus to appease them, it's not happening.”

There are also mixed discussions on adjustments to the federal-state cost-sharing of Medicaid, or FMAP, with lawmakers going back and forth about whether it's on the table. Norman said he's been discussing potential changes to FMAP with Johnson, an issue the speaker had said was off the table.

But LaLota told reporters that centrist Republicans in the Problem Solvers Caucus expressed to Johnson during a Monday meeting that fiscal hawks' push to limit federal dollars to state-run Medicaid programs is “a difficult pill for us all to swallow.”

“We want to know what's truly on the table, what's not, because that affects us in our district,” LaLota said. “It sounds like it's off the table, but yet I hear a couple of my colleagues still talking as if it's on the table. We'd prefer it to be off the table.”

Roy said he thinks the Rules Committee should delay the 1 a.m. Wednesday vote and he's “skeptical” of pushing the legislation through, especially without a “more thorough process.” He said he's been told numerous times that there will be “plenty of time to negotiate.”

“We made enough progress that we thought in good faith, we should move it forward,” Roy said of the legislation advancing out of the Budget Committee on Sunday. “But let's be clear, there are still very strong outstanding questions, and I think there are people across the entire conference who recognize that, and it is a mistake for this important of a policy to jam it through.”

Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD), Freedom Caucus chairman, said, “I think it's pretty obvious that we think we need more time,” calling the discussions “complicated.”

When asked if leadership should delay the Rules vote, Lawler said they had “better have a good number tonight.” 

Norman told reporters he'd vote for the bill out of the Rules Committee regardless of whether he personally likes the bill.

“The body has a right to vote on it,” Norman added.

Meanwhile, Johnson is moving full speed ahead. In an unrelated Rules Committee meeting on Monday night, the House approved a same-day authority that allows the reconciliation package to hit the floor as soon as Wednesday. A whip notice to lawmakers, obtained by the Washington Examiner, notes that an additional vote session could be added on Wednesday should Johnson call for a vote on the budget legislation.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that “it's essential that every Republican in the House and the Senate unite behind President Trump and pass this popular and essential legislative package.”

“It represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver on the Make America Great Again agenda responsible for President Trump's landslide victory on Nov. 5,” she said. “The America First policies in this bill are the reason why Republicans currently have the majority in Congress right now.”

Not all Republicans' votes are dependent on Trump's remarks at the conference meeting. Harris told reporters that he's “just not sure there's anything the president can tell me tomorrow that would change my mind at this point. I'm a hard no on it.”

When asked what he would say if Trump called him and asked him to vote yes, Harris said he would convince the president that “this moment in history is when he reverses the spending trajectory of the country, which he has run on.”

“He said he wants to solve the budget deficit,” Harris said. “I would make the case that this big, beautiful bill could get more beautiful with a little more work.”

The math is tough for Johnson. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who frequently detracts from his party over spending, is likely to be one of the three “no” votes Johnson can afford. Eyes will be on Roy and Norman, as well as Freedom Caucus members and like-minded lawmakers such as Reps. Victoria Spartz (R-IN) and Tim Burchett (R-TN), to see whether they will be swayed to vote in favor of the bill.

The speaker will not receive any help from Democrats. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) blasted the GOP for holding a 1 a.m. hearing on the reconciliation bill, accusing Republicans of wanting to “hide what's in it.”

REPUBLICANS MUSCLE THE ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' OUT OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE 

“If this legislation is designed to make life better for the American people, can someone explain to me why they would hold a hearing to advance the bill at 1 a.m. in the morning?” Jeffries asked.

“House Republicans, in particular, are once again shamefully bending the knee and serving as nothing more than a rubber stamp for Donald Trump's extreme agenda,” he added. “That's why he's coming up to the Hill tomorrow, to give them their marching orders.”

The Dallas Mavericks have officially won the draft lottery, and have the rights to draft Cooper Flagg with the 1st-overall pick. Nick Wright disputes the claim that the lottery is rigged. 

Despite entering the lottery with just 1.8% odds, the Dallas Mavericks landed the top selection for this year's upcoming NBA Draft.

The unexpected result sparked countless theories across the sports world. Many floated theories suggesting the NBA granted the Mavs a favor after the team traded superstar Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in February. Dallas will now have the opportunity to draft Duke standout Cooper Flagg.

Former Lakers star Shaquille O'Neal became one of the latest high-profile figures to chime in on the debate. The four-time NBA champion recalled a story from 1992 about late NBA Commissioner David Stern.

O'Neal, who was drafted by the Orlando Magic in 1992, claimed Stern approached him before that year's draft lottery and inquired about his preferred NBA destination.

"[He] pulled me to the side. 'You want to play where it's cold or where it's hot?'" O'Neal said. "He asked me that. I said, ‘hot' and then he smiled and I smiled."

A few months later, O'Neal watched as Orlando, Charlotte and Minnesota landed the top three picks.

"Minnesota was No. 3. Charlotte was No. 2 and then Orlando, Florida, was No. 1," he said. "I was like (while making a questioning face). I didn't think much about it. You hear a lot of these conspiracy theories. There are a lot of situations that can make these things sound good."

O'Neal said he wanted to avoid using the phrase "conspiracy theory" but he did describe the situation as "very interesting."

Former President Joe Biden‘s aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis has thrown a wrench in Democrats' plans to move beyond his presidency and 2024 campaign.

Biden's cancer diagnosis arrived amid heightened scrutiny of his cognitive health. The book Original Sin, set for release on Tuesday, details episodes of forgetfulness during Biden's presidency and alleges that his aides sought to conceal these problems. 

A comprehensive five-hour, 10-minute audio recording from a special counsel's October 2023 interview with Biden was obtained and released by Axios, in which his struggle to recall critical details, such as the year he left the vice presidency and the date of his son's passing, sparked renewed concerns about his cognitive condition.

Debate over Biden's mental fitness during his presidency divided Democrats, with some defending him while others accused his team of concealing his deficits to avoid a primary challenge.

Biden, 82, initially pursued a second term but withdrew in favor of former Vice President Kamala Harris following a faltering debate performance in late June that exposed his cognitive struggles.

Democratic strategist Jon Reinish acknowledged there is no evidence of a cover-up regarding the former president's diagnosis but noted that the Bidens' existing trust deficit, even among Democrats, has fueled skepticism and allowed conspiracy theories to take hold.

“In having that trust deficit, it automatically allows and gives room. It gives permission for other theories to jump in. So in that way, it's an unfortunate factor here,” Reinish said. “While people are compassionate, there's less of a bulwark of unhesitating goodwill. You know, people are angry at the Bidens. Democrats are angry at the Bidens. So, it is a tough thing to have to acknowledge.”

Biden is hardly the first president to face scrutiny over his health. Franklin D. Roosevelt concealed the effects of polio, Dwight D. Eisenhower downplayed a heart attack and stroke, and Woodrow Wilson's debilitating stroke was kept largely hidden from the public. John F. Kennedy secretly battled Addison's disease, and Ronald Reagan showed early signs of Alzheimer's that were never disclosed while he was in office.

That long-standing pattern of secrecy around the health of top officials resurfaced in early 2024, when former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin faced backlash for failing to disclose promptly his hospitalization for complications following prostate cancer surgery. The lack of transparency, even from top White House officials, sparked bipartisan criticism and raised concerns about accountability and communication at the highest levels of national security.

Michael LaRosa, who once worked as former first lady Jill Biden's press secretary, argued that Democrats must rebuild trust by openly admitting they were wrong to support Biden's reelection without questioning his fitness.

“We should have been asking more questions, we should have been more observant, and no, of course, he should not have run for president,” LaRosa said, speaking to the Washington Examiner. 

“No more dodging and robotic talking points that deflect from responsibility. [Democrats] have to just take responsibility and do it as fast as possible and get it over with, but do it in a matter that they can be consistent from now going forward because the ‘we're moving forward thing' does not cut it, doesn't cut it, and it won't cut it,” he said. 

“Voters forgive a lot of things, but they don't forgive phonies,” he added.

Republicans have been quick to revive the conversation around Biden. During his flight from Rome to Washington on Monday, Vice President JD Vance expressed well wishes for the former president but also urged a closer examination of his cognitive performance while in office.

“We really do need to be honest about whether the former president was capable of doing the job,” Vance said. “In some ways, I blame him less than I blame the people around him.”

The vice president raised concerns that doctors or White House aides may have deliberately concealed information about Biden's fitness for office from the public.

“Why didn't the American people have a better sense of his health picture? Why didn't the American people have more accurate information about what he was actually dealing with? This is serious stuff,” Vance said.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) criticized Republicans for spreading conspiracy theories and shifting focus away from current healthcare matters.

“It seems to me entirely inappropriate that at this moment in time when President Biden is dealing with a serious and aggressive form of cancer, there are Republicans who are peddling conspiracy theories and want us to look backward at a time when they actually are taking healthcare away from the American people,” Jeffries said on Monday. 

Jennifer Holdsworth, a Democratic strategist who managed former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg's bid for DNC chair, argued that raising doubts about Biden's cognitive state after his cancer diagnosis is inappropriate.

“I think it's craven and heartless to talk about anything else when anyone on planet Earth announces they have cancer,” Holdsworth told the Washington Examiner. “Democrats are all over the map on their thoughts regarding whether President Biden should have announced for reelection or not. But most of this narrative that is being spun is just another MAGA fever dream.”

The diagnosis has cast criticism of Biden's role in the party's 2024 defeat as insensitive, temporarily halting efforts by younger Democrats to address the matter with greater candor. 

“Unfortunately, I think it will lead to further speculation. I wish people could take a moment and focus on the impact of this on the former president and his family,” said Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist. “But, given the age we live in, there are all sorts of speculation … It's in poor taste to speculate on the nature of this illness and the history of the cancer without any medical expertise.”

Discussions regarding Biden's cognitive abilities during his tenure have created challenging questions for potential Democratic contenders in the 2028 presidential race. The matter is particularly sensitive for Harris and Buttigieg, who served in his administration.

Bannon said he believes Biden's top Cabinet-level officials will face further scrutiny for what they knew about his health struggles. 

“The new books coming out raise serious questions about what they knew and when they knew it. It's pretty clear he was in decline, and any attempt they may have made to hide his condition was not in the best service of the Democratic Party or the United States of America,” he said.

Reinish pointed out that with so many contenders likely in 2028, those who avoid getting tangled up in questions about Biden's health will have a clearer path, while others could face a tough uphill battle answering tough questions right out of the gate.

“I think that the less baggage you have, the better off you will be, because what you don't want to do is to start to tour the country and start to form an exploratory committee … and then you're bogged down with being asked what did you know and when did you know it around Joe Biden and his condition,” Reinish asked rhetorically. “Certain people will have to get through that baggage, but certain others won't.”

However, Holdsworth said she is confident that concerns over Biden's health will fade well before the 2028 race takes shape.

“I think, given the crisis-a-minute that is coming out of the Trump White House, we will be around the bend by the time 2028 discussions come into focus,” she said.

BIDEN DIAGNOSED WITH ‘AGGRESSIVE FORM' OF PROSTATE CANCER THAT HAS SPREAD TO HIS BONES

Democratic strategists are urging the party to focus on future priorities and concentrate their efforts on challenging Trump.

“The biggest issue is that the nation's economic problems have intensified since Donald Trump became president,” Bannon said. “Inflation is still rising; it rose again in April, and the Democrats have to make sure Trump answers for the problems he has created in the economy.”

LONDON, Ky. (AP) — More tornadoes plowed through the central U.S. on Monday, ripping apart buildings and knocking out power as people from Texas to Kentucky continued to clean up from days of severe weather that killed more than two dozen people and destroyed thousands of homes and buildings.

At least four tornadoes were confirmed in Oklahoma and Nebraska on Monday evening, according to a preliminary report from the National Weather Service.

Across Oklahoma, at least 10 homes were destroyed and multiple buildings were damaged, including a fire station that was wiped out, according to the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. A spokesperson for the agency said they have not received any reports of injuries or deaths.

Around 115,000 customers were without power in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Missouri, according to PowerOutage.us.

Parts of several highways were also closed due to flooding or storm damage. 

In northwest Arkansas, severe weather caused a Halsey concert to be canceled and a municipal airport had to close temporarily Monday night so crews could remove debris from the field. And in Oklahoma, Tulsa Public Schools canceled all afterschool activities.

Northern Texas saw softball-sized hail measuring 4 1/2 inches (11.4 centimeters) in diameter, according to Scott Kleebauer, a meteorologist with the service's Weather Prediction Center.




Earlier Monday in St. Louis, where officials estimated a Friday tornado damaged 5,000 buildings and may cost well over $1 billion, the mayor warned that federal assistance could take weeks.

Kentucky has been hardest hit by the storms. A devastating tornado late Friday into early Saturday damaged hundreds of homes, tossed vehicles and killed at least 19 people, most of them in southeastern Laurel County.

In London, Kentucky, where the devastation was centered, the small airport became a beehive of cleanup work after it took a direct hit from a tornado. Small aircraft stored there had large dents in them and even wings ripped open. Officials were using it as a base to get water, food, diapers and other supplies out to the community.

“We have 1,001 things going on. But we're managing it. And we're going to get it all cleaned up,” said London Mayor Randall Weddle. 

Officials in Kansas and Texas also were evaluating damage from late Sunday storms.

The risk of severe storms moves into Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee on Tuesday, the weather service said.

The Kentucky storms that killed 19 people were part of a weather system that caused seven deaths in Missouri and two in northern Virginia, authorities said.

Lonnie Nantz hid in a hallway with his wife, two daughters and a grandson as the one-story brick home they bought near London in 1977 was destroyed around them. They were trapped in rubble for about 20 minutes in the midnight darkness before they were rescued unharmed.

“I don't know why this happened. I've tried to live a good life all my life. I've still got the faith,” said the 77-year-old Nantz, who went to church as always on Sunday.

London city worker Ashley Taylor was back on the job Monday loading doughnuts to take to a hospital and dispatch center even though there was a tarp on her roof. She was lucky — the houses across her street were destroyed late Friday night.

She survived the storm with nine other people and three dogs in the crawl space of a neighbor's home.

“We prayed like never before — and just thankful for everything God did for us,” Taylor said.

In surrounding Laurel County, first responders mourned one of their own.

Fellow firefighters found the body of Laurel County Fire Major Leslie Leatherman on top of a woman he was shielding from the storm's fury as he answered calls during the worst of the storm. The woman was yelling for help and they were in a field across from a destroyed subdivision.

The injured woman turned out to be Leatherman's wife and officials aren't sure if he knew who he was protecting in the darkness and chaos, the fire department said on social media.

St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer said five people died, 38 were injured and more than 5,000 homes were affected by an EF3 tornado with winds up to 150 mph (240 kph) that slammed areas north and west of downtown Friday. Spencer has estimated that damages will exceed $1.6 billion. 

“Eight miles of pure destruction, at times a mile wide,” Spencer said at a Monday news conference. “We're talking about thousands of buildings, thousands of families are being displaced.”

The city is awaiting a disaster declaration from the governor's office as a first step to getting federal assistance.

U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, expressed frustration over the federal response to a deadly March storm. 

“I'm not happy about the fact we're still waiting from all of that damage two months ago,” Hawley said.

Acting Federal Emergency Management Agency Chief David Richardson said last week he plans to shift responsibility for disaster recovery to states this year as part of an agencywide transformation and that FEMA would coordinate federal assistance “when deemed necessary.”

Spencer said during a news conference Monday evening that emergency protocols put in place in 2021 were not followed, possibly preventing sirens being activated to warn residents about the tornado. 

She said it was not clear whose responsibility it was to let the community know about the emergency but that the fire department will do so moving forward.

In Texas, several tornadoes touched down west of Fort Worth on Sunday, including an EF1 with peak winds of 105 mph (169 kph) that caused damage in and around Gordon, the weather service said Monday.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) made accusations on Sunday that the Trump administration and budget cuts initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency contributed to the Mexican navy training ship that crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge, which killed two people and injured 20. 

“With the Brooklyn Bridge strike last night, I'm fighting for answers about whether Trump and DOGE have impacted water traffic control,” Schumer said. “We know they've been meddling with U.S. Coast Guard staffing. Trump relieved Admiral Linda Fagan as Commandant of the USCG, and that position is still vacant.”

With the Brooklyn Bridge strike last night:I'm fighting for answers about whether Trump and DOGE have impacted water traffic control.We know they've been meddling with U.S. Coast Guard staffing.Trump relieved Admiral Linda Fagan as Commandant of the USCG, and that position…

“And the hiring freeze has limited the ability for the USCG to staff up the Vehicle Traffic Service, that's their traffic control operation that acts like Air Traffic Control but on water,” Schumer added. “We need action for our national security, infrastructure protection, and public safety.”

Schumer never provided any proof to support his accusation. On Monday, the U.S. Coast Guard rejected the senator's accusation, explaining that its traffic service system was fully operational. 

“The U.S. Coast Guard's New York Vessel Traffic Service was fully functional during the incident, operating in accordance with established procedures to manage commercial traffic and facilitate safe navigation,” a spokesperson from the Coast Guard said.

“Our response included launching a crew from Station New York, establishing a temporary safety zone, and coordinating with NYPD, FDNY, and NYC DOT,” the spokesperson added.

The Coast Guard is the second federal agency in as many days to refute Schumer's claims about the tragic accident. On Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security denied the New York senator's assertions and scolded him for making such an accusation. 

DHS REBUKES SCHUMER OVER COMMENTS ABOUT MEXICAN NAVY SHIP CRASH

“Minority Leader Schumer's accusations that a hiring freeze led to the U.S. Coast Guard's Vessel Traffic Services not being adequately staffed are FALSE,” the DHS wrote on X. “The US Coast Guard has been fully supported and been exempt from hiring freezes. Additionally, this incident had nothing to do with Vessel Traffic Services — when a ship loses propulsion in a high current area, the vessel needs to engage all capabilities to stop and ideally tugs are nearby to support.”

“We encourage Minority Leader Schumer to get his facts straight before he misleads the American people,” the DHS added.

Bodycam footage released by the Department of Homeland Security showed the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was detained at a federal immigration detention center. Baraka on Saturday denied trespassing during a confrontation with ICE agents that led to his arrest while the Democrat was at the facility with three members of Congress.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver is being charged with assault after a skirmish with federal officers outside an immigration detention center, said New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, who also announced Monday that she was dropping a trespassing case against the Newark mayor whose arrest led to the disturbance.

Interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba wrote on social media that McIver is facing a charge of assaulting, impeding or interfering with law enforcement, but court papers providing details were not immediately released or publicly available online.

The prosecution of McIver is a rare federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress for allegations other than fraud or corruption. The case instantly taps into a much broader and more consequential power struggle between a Trump administration engaged in a sweeping overhaul of immigration policy and a Democratic party scrambling for ways to respond.

Within minutes of Habba's announcement, McIver's Democratic colleagues cast the prosecution as an infringement on lawmakers' official duties to serve their constituents and an effort to silence their opposition to an immigration policy that helped propel the president back into power but now has emerged as divisive fault line in American political discourse.

At the same time, Habba announced that her office agreed to dismiss a misdemeanor charge against Democratic Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested after he attempted to join McIver and two other members of New Jersey's congressional delegation inspecting the facility in their oversight capacity. Habba said the decision was reached “for the sake of moving forward” and said she has invited the mayor to tour the Delaney Hall detention center and will join him herself. 




“The citizens of New Jersey deserve unified leadership so we can get to work to keep our state safe,” Habba said in a statement. 

McIver has denied any wrongdoing and has accused federal agents of escalating the situation by arresting the mayor. She denounced the charge as “purely political” and said prosecutors are distorting her actions in an effort to deter legislative oversight. 

“This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right,” she said in a statement. “I am thankful for the outpouring of support I have received and I look forward to the truth being laid out clearly in court.”

A nearly two-minute clip released by the Homeland Security Department shows McIver on the facility side of a chain-link fence just before the arrest of the mayor on the street side of the fence. She and uniformed officials go through the gate and she joins others shouting “surround the mayor.” The video shows McIver in a tightly packed group of people and officers. At one point her left elbow and then her right elbow push into an officer wearing a dark face covering and an olive green uniform emblazoned with the word “Police” on it.

It isn't clear from bodycam video whether that contact was intentional, incidental or a result of jostling in the chaotic scene.

In a post on X, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said McIver was being charged after a “thorough review of the video footage” and investigation by Homeland Security Investigations.

“Assaults on federal law enforcement will not be tolerated,” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a post on X. “This Administration will always protect those who work tirelessly to keep America safe.”

McIver's attorney called the decision to charge her “spectacularly inappropriate,” saying she went to Delaney Hall “to do her job” and she has the responsibility as a member of Congress to oversee U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's treatment of detainees. As of Monday night, neither McIver nor her attorneys had gotten charging documents from prosecutors, according to an emailed statement from a spokesperson for her attorney.

“Rather than facilitating that inspection, ICE agents chose to escalate what should have been a peaceful situation into chaos,” Paul Fishman, the former U.S. attorney for New Jersey, said in a statement. “This prosecution is an attempt to shift the blame for ICE's behavior to Congresswoman McIver. In the courtroom, facts — not headlines — will matter.”

Baraka, who is seeking the Democratic nomination in this year's governor's race, had repeatedly denied trespassing and said he had been invited inside the gate at one point before the arrest.

He said in an emailed statement Monday that he was glad the case against him was dismissed. He said he will “continue to advocate for the humane treatment of detainees” and “continue to press the facility to ensure that it is compliant with City of Newark codes and regulations.” 

Baraka called McIver a “daughter of Newark” and said he stood with her.

“I fully expect her to be vindicated,” he said.

McIver, 38, first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep. Donald Payne Jr. left a vacancy in the 10th District. She was then elected to a full term in November. A Newark native, she served as the president of the Newark City Council from 2022 to 2024 and worked in the city's public schools before that.

House Democratic leaders decried the criminal case against their colleague in a lengthy statement in which they called the charge “extreme, morally bankrupt” and lacking “any basis in law or fact.”

“The proceeding initiated by the so-called U.S. Attorney in New Jersey is a blatant attempt by the Trump administration to intimidate Congress and interfere with our ability to serve as a check and balance on an out-of-control executive branch,” said the statement from Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York and other senior members of the party. “House Democrats will not be intimidated by the Trump administration. Not today. Not ever.”

Robert Griffin III was among those who chimed in on the latest saga in the rivalry between basketball stars Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark, saying the Chicago Sky star "hates Caitlin Clark."

"After watching Caitlin Clark's flagrant foul on Angel Reese and the aftermath, there is no way Angel Reese can continue the lie that she doesn't dislike Caitlin Clark," Griffin wrote on X. "I know what hatred looks like. Angel Reese HATES Caitlin Clark. Not some basketball rivalry hate either. Hate."

Griffin later claimed his statement was "purely based in basketball" and was simply a "sports take."

Tempers flared between Reese and Clark after the Fever guard committed a flagrant foul on the Sky forward. It was one of the bigger moments of Indiana's 93-58 blowout win on Saturday. 

Current ESPN NFL analyst and former Pittsburgh Steelers star Ryan Clark reacted to Griffin's comments on the Reese-Clark drama. Clark suggested Griffin was joining the "hate train" and was falling in line with the positions other media figures have taken.

"When RG3 jumps onto the hate train or the angry train, it now follows what we saw from Keith Olbermann, what we saw from Dave Portnoy, as they poured onto Angel Reese to make her the villain, and Caitlin Clark heroic or hero story," Clark said during a recent episode of his "The Pivot" podcast. 

"The one thing we know about RG3 is he's not having conversations at his home about what Black women have to endure in this country. About what young Black women and athletes like Angel Reese have had to deal with being on the opposite side of Caitlin Clark's rise and ascension into stardom."

Clark then highlighted the former NFL quarterback's marriage.

"If you're RG3, when is the last time within your household you've had a conversation about what [Angel Reese is] dealing with?" Clark asked. "You haven't been able to do that because in both of your marriages, you've been married to White women."

Griffin is married to Grete Griffin, who is a native of Estonia and a heptathlete.

"You haven't had opportunities to have those conversations to educate you on what they're feeling, what Black women deal with, what they're seeing when they think of a young Angel Reese. And the whole time that he's mimicking Angel Reese and bobbing his head and moving his neck while he's doing this whole piece, his wife is in the back amening and clapping."

Griffin left ESPN in 2024. Multiple outlets reported at the time that Griffin's dismissal was a cost-cutting move.

"When I worked with RG3, he would make all of these sort of corny jokes about milk and how much he loved it and how important it was. And he always points out on social media the color of his wife's white skin. As if the color of her skin is what makes her special. As if the color of her skin is what makes her a good wife," Clark continued.

"I've met the lady. I've had a conversation with her. I think she's more than that. But it also leads to what Black women deal with a lot from Black men who have chose to date or marry outside of their race. They always feel like they have to go the extra mile to prop up the woman that they married or the woman that they're with over Black women by denigrating Black women."

Griffin caught wind of Clark's comments and took to social media to share his response.

"Ryan Clark personally attacking me and my family personally over a sports opinion is cowardly, spineless, and weak," Griffin wrote on X, along with a more than two-minute-long video. Griffin also stated several times that Clark's assertions were "way out of bounds."

Caitlin Clark and Reese have major history, going back to the 2023 NCAA women's basketball national championship. Both players downplayed the incident. 

Clark told ESPN's Holly Rowe after the third quarter that there had been "nothing malicious" behind the foul.

The creator of the Dilbert comic strip, which was canceled by most newspapers two years ago over the creator's racist comments, said Monday that he has been diagnosed with the same aggressive prostate cancer as former President Joe Biden.

“I have the same cancer that Joe Biden has,” Scott Adams said Monday during an episode of his YouTube show, “Real Coffee with Scott Adams. “So, I also have prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones.”

He made the announcement after extending his “respect and compassion and sympathy” for Biden and his family. Biden announced his diagnosis on Sunday and said he and his family were reviewing treatment options with his doctors.

Adams, 67, said he's always in pain, uses a walker to get around and that he expects to die sometime this summer. 

“It's basically intolerable,” he said of the pain.

Adams said he has had time to process his diagnosis and that it has given him time to say goodbyes, get his affairs in order and do all the things he needed to do.

Dilbert the comic strip first appeared in 1989, poking fun at office culture. It ran for decades in numerous newspapers but disappeared with lightning speed in 2023 following racist remarks by Adams. 

On his YouTube show at the time, among other things, he described Black people as a “hate group” and said he would no longer “help Black Americans.” 

He later said he was being hyperbolic, yet continued to defend his stance.




Various media publishers across the U.S. denounced the comments as racist, hateful and discriminatory while saying they would no longer provide a platform for his work. 

The editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, which dumped “Dilbert” in 2022, said the comic strip “went from being hilarious to being hurtful and mean.”

The first few aid trucks have entered Gaza following nearly three months of Israel's blockade of food, medicine and other supplies, Israel and the United Nations said Monday, as Israel acknowledged growing pressure from allies including the United States.

The Israeli military released a video on Monday showing what they say are troops operating in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile after a nearly three-month blockade and warnings by global experts of impeding famine, Israel says it will allow a limited amount of humanitarian aid into Gaza even as it launches “extensive” new ground operations there.

Doctors worked to treat injured children on Monday at a hospital in southern Gaza. A group of Palestinian men also sat by the wrapped body of a leader of the armed wing of a Palestinian militant group which said he was killed in a shootout during an Israeli operation in Khan Younis.

Israel has launched a new wave of air and ground operations across Gaza, and the army ordered the evacuation of the enclave's second-largest city, Khan Younis, where Israel carried out a massive operation earlier in the war that left much of the area in ruins.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The first few aid trucks entered Gaza on Monday following nearly three months of Israel's blockade of food, medicine and other supplies, Israel and the United Nations said, as Israel acknowledged growing pressure from allies including the United States.

Five trucks carrying baby food and other desperately needed aid entered the territory of over 2 million Palestinians via the Kerem Shalom crossing, according to the Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, COGAT.

The U.N. humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, called it a “welcome development” but described the trucks as a “drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed.” Food security experts last week warned of famine in Gaza. During the latest ceasefire that Israel ended in March, some 600 aid trucks entered Gaza each day.

Fletcher said an additional four U.N. trucks were cleared to enter Gaza. Those trucks may enter Tuesday, COGAT said. Fletcher added that given the chaotic situation on the ground, the U.N. expects the aid could be looted or stolen, a growing problem as resources became increasingly scarce.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his decision to resume “minimal” aid to Gaza came after allies said they couldn't support Israel's new military offensive if there are “images of hunger” coming from the Palestinian territory.

Shortly after Israel announced the first trucks entered Gaza, the U.K., France and Canada issued a sharply worded joint statement calling the aid “wholly inadequate.” They threatened “concrete actions” against Israel, including sanctions, for its activities in Gaza and the occupied West Bank and called on Israel to stop its “egregious” new military actions in Gaza.




Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the joint statement and called it “a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7.”

Israel over the weekend launched a new wave of air and ground operations across Gaza, and the army ordered the evacuation of its second-largest city, Khan Younis, where a massive operation earlier in the 19-month war left much of the area in ruins.

Israel says it is pressuring Hamas to release the remaining hostages abducted in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. Hamas has said it will only release them in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. 

Netanyahu repeated Monday that Israel plans on “taking control of all of Gaza.” He has said Israel will encourage what he describes as the voluntary emigration of much of Gaza's population to other countries — something that Palestinians have rejected.

In a video statement, Netanyahu said Israel's “greatest friends in the world” had told him, “We cannot accept images of hunger, mass hunger. We cannot stand that. We will not be able to support you.”

The Trump administration, which has voiced full support for Israel's actions and blames Hamas for deaths in Gaza, has expressed growing concern over the hunger crisis. President Donald Trump — who skipped Israel on his trip to the region last week — voiced concern, as did Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Netanyahu's video statement appeared aimed at pacifying anger in his nationalist base at the decision to resume aid. Two far-right governing partners have pressed Netanyahu not to allow aid into Gaza.

Aid into Gaza would be “minimal,” Netanyahu said, and would act as a bridge toward the launch of a new aid system in Gaza. A U.S.-backed organization will distribute assistance in hubs that will be secured by the Israeli military.

Israel says the plan is meant to prevent Hamas from accessing aid, which Israel says it uses to bolster its rule in Gaza.

U.N. agencies and aid groups have rejected the plan, saying it won't reach enough people and would weaponize aid in contravention of humanitarian principles. They have refused to take part.

According to aid officials familiar with the plan, it will involve setting up distribution points mostly in southern Gaza, forcing many Palestinians to move south once again. The recent ceasefire saw hundreds of thousands return to homes in the north.

The statement by France, Canada and the U.K. marked one of their most significant criticisms of Israel's handling of the war in Gaza and Israel's actions in the occupied West Bank.

“We oppose any attempt to expand settlements in the West Bank,” the three countries said, calling them illegal.

The countries said they have always supported Israel's right to defend itself against terrorism but called the military escalation in Gaza disproportionate. The countries earlier criticized the new U.S.-backed proposal for aid delivery in Gaza, saying it would not align with humanitarian law.

Canada has already imposed a series of sanctions against Israel over the last two years regarding settler violence in the West Bank. It was unclear how much France can act unilaterally given that it is a member of the European Union.

In a separate, letter Monday, the foreign ministers of Germany, Italy, Japan and 18 other countries — not including the United States — called for Israel to fully reopen humanitarian aid delivery to Gaza by the U.N. and non-governmental organizations.

The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 others. The militants are still holding 58 captives, around a third believed to be alive, after most of the rest were returned in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

Israel's retaliatory offensive, which has destroyed large swaths of Gaza, has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count.

The war has displaced around 90% of its population, most of them multiple times.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday signed into law the Take It Down Act, a measure that imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation that first lady Melania Trump helped usher through Congress, and he had her sign it, too, despite what sounded like a mild objection on her part. 

“C'mon, sign it anyway,” the president told his wife. “She deserves to sign it,” he said. 

After she added her signature, the president held up the document to show both of their names to the audience at the ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. Melania Trump's signature is merely symbolic since first ladies are not elected and they play no role in the enactment of legislation.

In March, Melania Trump used her first public appearance since resuming the role of first lady to travel to Capitol Hill to lobby House members to pass the bill following its approval by the Senate. 

At a signing ceremony, she called the new law a “national victory” that will help protect children from online exploitation, including through the use of artificial intelligence to make fake images.

“AI and social media are the digital candy for the next generation, sweet addictive and engineered to have an impact on the cognitive development of our children,” she said. “But unlike sugar, these new technologies can be weaponized, shape beliefs and, sadly, affect emotions and even be deadly.”

The president said the proliferation of images made using AI means that “countless women have been harassed with deepfakes and other explicit images distributed against their will.” He said what's happening is “just so horribly wrong.” 




“Today, we're making it totally illegal,” Trump said. 

The bill makes it a federal crime to “knowingly publish” or threaten to publish intimate images without a person's consent, including AI-created “deepfakes.” Websites and social media companies will be required to remove such material within 48 hours after a victim requests it. The platforms must also take steps to delete duplicate content. 

Many states have already banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn, but the Take It Down Act is a rare example of federal regulators imposing on internet companies.

The bill, introduced by Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, passing the House in April by a 409-2 vote and clearing the Senate by unanimous consent. 

But the measure isn't without critics. Free speech advocates and digital rights groups say the bill is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate images, including legal pornography and LGBTQ content. Others say it could allow the government to monitor private communications and undermine due process.

The first lady appeared at a Capitol Hill roundtable with lawmakers and young women who had explicit images of them put online, saying it was “heartbreaking” to see what teenagers and especially girls go through after this happens to them. She also included a victim among her guests for the president's address to a joint session of Congress the day after that meeting.

After the House passed the bill, Melania Trump said the bipartisan vote was a “powerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy and safety of our children.”

Her advocacy for the bill represents a continuation of the Be Best campaign she started in the president's first term, focusing on children's well-being, social media use and opioid abuse.

In his speech to Congress in March, the president said he looked forward to signing the bill.

“And I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don't mind,” he said, adding, that there's nobody who “gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.”

Elon Musk said Tuesday that he expects Tesla and xAI will continue buying chips from semiconductor giants Nvidia and AMD, and possibly others.

Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, which now owns X (formerly Twitter) has already installed 200,000 GPUs at its Colossus facility in Memphis, the Tesla CEO told CNBC's David Faber on Tuesday. XAI is also planning a 1 million GPU facility outside of Memphis, Musk said. 

He did not specify how many chips the company had already ordered and by which date they may be installed.

"A few years ago, I made a very obvious prediction, which is that the limitation on AI will be chips," he said.

At his autos business, Tesla, Musk said the company's Dojo supercomputer in Buffalo, New York is already used for training its Autopilot and Optimus robotics systems.

As the 44th Vice President of the United States, Dan Quayle made dozens of diplomatic trips, many aimed at helping to shape the post-Cold War Soviet Union. As a voter, Quayle has cast his ballot for Donald Trump in three consecutive presidential elections. But when you put those two things together, the current view from the former V.P. comes to a pessimistic conclusion about the current posture in U.S.-Russia relations and the war in Ukraine.

"We are not approaching the end," Quayle, who is now chairman of Cerberus Global Investments, said at the CNBC CEO Council Summit in Arizona on Tuesday. "Putin has no desire to see this come to a conclusion until he really dismantles Ukraine," he said.

While Quayle is clear on Putin's thinking, it is Trump's strategy that mystifies him. "I do not understand Trump's affinity for Putin and why he has not demanded anything here," he said. "All he wants to do as president is deals ... So, if you're a dealmaker, what do you need? Leverage. What leverage is he trying to put on Putin? Zero. Absolutely zero," Quayle said.

Over the weekend, Trump had posted on Truth Social ahead of talks with Russian and Ukrainian leaders, "HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A PRODUCTIVE DAY, A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE, AND THIS VERY VIOLENT WAR, A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, WILL END," in his customary all-capitalized comments.

On Monday, after an over two-hour call between Trump and Putin, the president said he wanted the "bloodbath" to end, but there was little sign of a breakthrough, even as Trump said Russia and Ukraine would hold direct talks on a ceasefire "immediately," on his social media platform. He also spoke to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday.

"Putin says he won't agree to a ceasefire, he just wants to talk, Trump says OK," Quayle told CNBC's Sara Eisen in an interview at the CEO Council Summit. He said the lack of pressure also undermines a U.S. policy alliance with the European Union, that if Russia did not agree to a ceasefire there would be secondary sanctions. "Putin said let's talk, and Trump says yes, and European leaders just had the rug pulled out from under them," Quayle said. "I don't think it will end any time soon," he added.

Quayle's view of the Russian playbook is that all along it's been to "dismantle Ukraine, and time is on his side."

And even though Putin has not been as successful as he would have liked on the battlefield, "he's been very successful with Trump," Quayle said, adding that Putin's KGB background makes him and his circle well placed to know Trump's "weakness and vulnerability and how to deal with him."

While Quayle does not believe Trump can unilaterally "wash his hands" of the conflict when he finally realizes Putin has no interest in a ceasefire — "Congress has something to say about that and there is still bipartisan support for Ukraine," he said — Quayle says the president has blown an opportunity to apply pressure in three ways that would work to change Putin's approach.

To end the war, the U.S. needs "lots of money in Swiss banks that are Russian given to Ukraine," Quayle said. 

Second, the U.S. needs to give Ukraine even more weapons.

Third, there needs to be secondary sanctions on Russia.

"Suddenly, Putin would come to the table if you do those three things," Quayle said. "He comes to the table tomorrow."

But Quayle does not think this will happen. "It's not what he believes, he doesn't want to do anything substantial to bring pressure or leverage on Putin," he said.

The strategy on Russia leaves Quayle perplexed. "I don't have an answer," he said.

While he noted that Trump is fond of saying it's "Biden's war," he believes there will be political repercussions for the President's already weakened popularity if Trump lets Ukraine fall. "You inherited this war, but it is on your watch, and if he completely walks away from Ukraine, which I don't think he will, but he might, there will be a significant political price."

"American people do not like war, but they do not like losing wars, and if he is viewed as the loser on this, there will be a price to pay, so he needs to figure it out," Quayle said.

"He wants peace. He doesn't like war, but then he is so one-sided, and that is a problem," he added.

While Trump warned Zelenskyy that he was risking World War III in their infamous Oval Office meeting, Quayle says the bigger risk is the current Trump strategy: "You really want to talk about who is risking [WWIII]? Just let Russia gobble up Ukraine, and then Poland, and then the Balkans, and then you are going to be talking about World War III."

During the interview, Quayle also seemed perplexed by Trump's tariffs strategy. "You call that a strategy?" he said in response to a question's framing. "I don't think there's a strategy. It's so top down. But it's either the mad man theory or it's gross incompetence, or maybe somewhere in between. ... We'll have to wait and see. In the short term, I don't think there's going to be a huge impact, but long term, capital expenditures are being delayed, supply chains are being disrupted. It will be inflationary down the road," he said.

On China, he said there can be no total de-coupling between the two nations given $600 billion in trade, but companies are moving away from China as much as it is possible and where it is practicable as part of long-term planning. The Trump administration does realize the much bigger question is how to "prevent a hot war between the United States and China, not tomorrow or next month or two years from now, but down the road," he said.

Quayle added that while Trump's recent trip to the Middle East was "successful" and the deals are a win for the U.S. in terms of countering China's growing influence in the wealthy, geopolitically sensitive region, his approach to Russia and Putin isn't helping. Even though the former V.P. does not believe there is any near-term threat of a full invasion of Taiwan by China, certain smaller, relatively lightly populated islands closer to mainland China could be targeted. "China is watching Ukraine carefully because of Taiwan," he said.

"Looking at the situation in Ukraine, and watching how Russia avoids these sanctions, and Russia is doing a good job of it. China is watching that. Xi Jinping is looking at that," Quayle said.

Xreal on Tuesday announced a set of so-called "extended reality" glasses that run Google's Android XR software, as the companies look to take on Meta and Apple in a new arena.

The launch marks an early step from Alphabet's Google to become a major operating system for future virtual and augmented reality smart glasses and headsets, much like Android has turned into a default option for most smartphones.

Xreal, a Chinese company backed by Alibaba, calls its glasses Project Aura and describes them as a lightweight extended reality — or XR — product. XR is a broad term encompassing technologies that merge real and virtual worlds.

Android XR, Google's operating system for these products, was launched last year and is infused with its AI assistant Gemini.

Samsung's Project Moohan, a type of headset that looks to rival Apple's $3,500 Vision Pro, was the first device announced that runs Android XR. Samsung plans to launch the hardware this year.

Xreal's Project Aura is the second device announced that will operate on Android XR, and it is the first such device in the glasses format.

Few details have been released about the tech, which was announced at the Google I/O conference. Xreal said the glasses will have Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR chips, which are specially designed for these pieces of hardware.

Xreal also said the glasses will be "tethered," meaning they will connect to another device to run. The company has not yet provided details on what the glasses will need to be linked to.

The startup has released previous products that have run its in-house operating system, featured its own chips and connected to its own second device. But Project Aura will now rely more heavily on Google's software and on Qualcomm semiconductors.

The timeline and price of Project Aura were not immediately disclosed. Xreal will likely release a headset for developers to start experimenting and building apps first, then a consumer product at a later date.

For Google, the more devices that run Android XR, the more appealing it will be for developers to build apps for the operating system. A large part of any operating system's success is the quality of apps available for users.

For Xreal, being an early partner with Google and working with Qualcomm will give it access to the latest technology in the XR space, as well as to marketing for its products.

The launch of Project Aura also marks a step up competition with Meta and its continued efforts with the Meta Ray-Ban product and the likes of Snap, which unveiled a new set of its Spectacles last year.

Glasses also offer an alternative to bulky headsets. Tech giants including Apple and Meta see extended reality as a potential new paradigm in computing.

Chinese-born crypto mogul Justin Sun says he's the top holder of the $TRUMP meme token and will be having dinner with President Donald Trump.

The dinner competition — a sweepstakes offering gala access to the sitting U.S. president — was open to anyone in the world willing to spend millions of dollars on a digital coin tied to Trump. 

On Thursday, the top 220 $TRUMP holders are invited to a dinner with the president at his Virginia golf club outside of Washington, D.C.

Late Monday night, Sun posted on X that he had secured the top spot in the $TRUMP token leaderboard, which earned him an invite to a dinner with the president, as well as a VIP reception for the top 25 holders.

"Honored to support @POTUS and grateful for the invitation from @GetTrumpMemes to attend President Trump's Gala Dinner as his TOP fan!" he wrote. "As the top holder of $TRUMP, I'm excited to connect with everyone, talk crypto, and discuss the future of our industry."

Sun now holds $18.6 million worth of the Trump-themed meme token, on top of the $75 million he previously poured into World Liberty Financial — a separate crypto venture that routes 75% of the platform's revenue directly to Trump-owned entities.

Altogether, Sun's stake in the Trump family's crypto empire now tops $93 million.

Born in China, Sun is the crypto entrepreneur behind the Tron blockchain and is in talks with the Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve civil fraud charges. 

His case was paused in February, shortly after investing tens of millions of dollars into World Liberty's WLFI token.

The $TRUMP coin rose in value by about 2% on Tuesday to $13.27, according to Coinmarketcap.com. That values the circulating supply at $2.65 billion, making it the 39th most valuable cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is the most valuable at $2.1 trillion.

Like with other meme coins, there's no underlying product. 

The project's website says the coins "are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type." 

The SEC issued guidance in February saying that most meme coins are not considered securities under U.S. federal law.

Watchdog group Accountable.US referred to the moment as seeing "corruption unfold in real time" and renewed warnings that the $TRUMP token competition is opening backdoor access to foreign and corporate actors with little oversight and major stakes in Trump-linked assets.

"This dubious situation perfectly sums up why this $TRUMP coin competition was always going to become a magnet for foreign influence, unprecedented self-dealing and next level swampiness," said Tony Carrk, executive director of Accountable.US.

The nature of the pseudonymous wallets raises questions about the true identities and motivations of the token's largest holders.

Documents from blockchain analytics firm Inca Digital that were reviewed by CNBC show where the top 275 $TRUMP token holders send and receive the token. Many are heavily tied to international exchanges like Binance that don't service U.S. customers, an indication that they're likely not U.S. citizens.

An analysis by Bloomberg revealed that 19 of the top 25 wallets are almost certainly owned by individuals operating outside the U.S.

The leaderboard — now closed — captured an extraordinary concentration of wealth and influence behind a volatile asset launched just days before the inauguration. 

More than $5.2 billion in realized gains have flowed to the top-performing wallets, while a larger number of addresses — over 590,000 — have collectively lost $3.9 billion, according to Inca Digital.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., the ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations, warned that the Trump family's growing crypto holdings may serve as a backdoor for foreign and corporate interests seeking access to the president.

"President Trump's financial entanglements to the $TRUMP coin, as well as the attempted use of the White House to host competitions to prop up the value of $TRUMP, represents an unprecedented, pay-to-play scheme to provide access to the Presidency to the highest bidder," Blumenthal wrote.

Apple Intelligence technology will be opened up to developers under a new plan.

Apple Inc. is preparing to allow third-party developers to write software using its artificial intelligence models, aiming to spur the creation of new applications and make its devices more enticing. 

The iPhone maker is working on a software development kit and related frameworks that will let outsiders build AI features based on the large language models that the company uses for Apple Intelligence, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Apple expects to unveil the plan on June 9 at its Worldwide Developers Conference, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative hasn't been announced.

The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday outlined new regulatory guidance for future Covid-19 vaccine boosters, setting stricter approval standards for healthy Americans. 

The agency said it wants to see new clinical trials showing Covid shots are still safe and effective before approving them for healthy adults and children, a costly new requirement for pharmaceutical companies that could limit who gets new jabs each year. Previously, the FDA typically approved updated Covid shots for all Americans each year based on simple tests that show they trigger a strong enough antibody response.

The FDA recommended different standards of evidence for approval based on patients' risk of getting severely sick from Covid, according to a paper published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The paper's authors are FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and Vinay Prasad, an outspoken critic of the pharmaceutical industry who was appointed to lead the agency's division that oversees vaccines.

"The FDA's new Covid-19 philosophy represents a balance of regulatory flexibility and a commitment to gold-standard science," the agency said in the paper. "The FDA will approve vaccines for high-risk persons and, at the same time, demand robust, gold-standard data on persons at low risk."

The new guidance comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, overhauls the nation's health agencies and U.S. immunization policy.

For adults 65 and older, and for people as young as 6 months who have certain underlying health conditions, the FDA said it will accept immunogenicity data — which shows a vaccine generates a strong immune response — as enough to determine that a shot's benefits outweigh its risks. The FDA estimates that 100 to 200 million Americans have conditions that put them at high risk of severe illness, including obesity and mental health conditions such as depression.

But for healthy people between 6 months and 64 years old who don't have risk factors, the FDA plans to require stronger evidence for vaccines from randomized, controlled trials. The agency said these studies must show actual clinical outcomes, such as fewer infections or hospitalizations, before it will grant full approval of a shot. 

"Our policy also balances the need for evidence," Makary and Prasad wrote. "We simply don't knowwhether a healthy 52-year-old woman with a normal BMI who has had Covid-19 three times and has received six previous doses of a Covid-19 vaccine will benefit from the seventh dose."

The FDA said that when it approves a Covid vaccine for high-risk people, it will encourage manufacturers to conduct randomized, controlled clinical trials in healthy adults as part of their post-marketing commitment for the shot.

Makary and Prasad argued that the nation's "one-size-fits-all" Covid vaccine policy approach, which recommends annual shots for all Americans above six months old, is outdated and no longer in line with other countries. All other high-income nations limit vaccine recommendations to older adults or those at high risk for severe illness due to Covid, they said. 

They said the benefit of repeat vaccinations is "uncertain," particularly among low-risk patients who have developed some immune protection through previous shots, infections or both. Makary and Prasad said many Americans and health-care providers "remain unconvinced" of that benefit, pointing to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on falling vaccination rates in the U.S. for annual Covid boosters. 

They cited CDC data that indicates that for the past two seasons, fewer than 25% of Americans have received a Covid-19 shot, including fewer than 10% of kids and fewer than 50% of adults over the age of 75. Less than one-third of health-care workers received updated Covid boosters in the 2023 to 2024 season, they said, citing CDC data.

They also suggested that broad Covid vaccine recommendations each year have contributed to declining trust in vaccination, including in the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Still, Makary and Prasad called MMR vaccines "clearly established as safe and highly effective."

Makary and Prasad will further address the new framework during a virtual town hall on Tuesday at 1 p.m. ET.

In this article

Elon Musk on Tuesday said he plans to spend "a lot less" on political donations in the future, signaling a change in attitude from President Donald Trump's top campaign backer.

Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and the head of the government-slashing initiative DOGE, spent more than $250 million helping Trump win a second White House term.

But when asked at the Qatar Economic Forum if he will continue spending at that level in upcoming elections, Musk said he would not.

"I think, in terms of political spending, I'm going to do a lot less in the future," Musk said.

When asked why, he said, "I think I've done enough."

But Musk, the world's richest man, said he may change his mind at some point. 

"Well, if I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it," he said.

"I do not currently see a reason," he added.

Musk is set to speak again at 2 p.m. ET with CNBC's David Faber.

The remarks in Doha likely come as an unpleasant surprise to Republicans running for reelection in 2026.

On top of his Trump-related donations, Musk spent more than $19 million in the final weeks of the 2024 election cycle to help Republicans win narrow majorities in Congress.

His super political action committee, America PAC, was also a top outside spender in this year's high-profile election for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court that ultimately determined the court's ideological majority.

Musk-linked groups reportedly dropped more than $13 million in the lead-up to that April 1 race, which his preferred candidate lost.

Musk has been a major presence in Washington, D.C., since Trump's electoral victory, appearing regularly by the president's side and making himself highly visible as the face of DOGE, the group working to rapidly dismantle a slew of government agencies and projects.

But this increased visibility has taken a toll on the billionaire and his companies.

Musk's controversial actions and views — many of which he has aired on his social media platform X — coupled with his massive influence in the White House, have proven unpopular with the majority of Americans.

Polls show that public opinion of Musk, his companies and their products have all fallen sharply since January.

That shift coincided with a decline in Tesla's market value in the two months since Musk has entered the government, though its shares have recently rebounded. Tesla cars and showrooms have also emerged as targets for vandalism and arson.

Musk has previously signaled he plans to turn his focus back to his businesses. His time spent running DOGE will "significantly" drop starting this month, he told analysts in April on Tesla's quarterly earnings call.

Musk has recently fallen far out of the spotlight in D.C., Politico reported Monday.

But his apparent public pullback from politics does not mean he is leaving the sphere entirely, a Musk advisor told NBC News later Tuesday.

"Musk scaling back his public profile does not diminish his influence. I think it can actually sharpen it," the person said. "He can still quietly fund stuff and support stuff he believes in, causes he believes in, but does not create unnecessary noise. These midterms will be about message discipline and a focus on the economy, not fights on X."

As a pediatrician, I spend a lot of time engaging with families about nutrition. My philosophy is simple: If you empower a child to embrace healthy eating habits early on, they are more likely to carry these positive behaviors into adulthood. 

Early intervention can be transformative and help substantially reduce their long-term risk of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and even certain types of cancer.

Many parents already know the importance of feeding kids vegetables and limiting added sugar. We often discuss "eating the rainbow," emphasizing the need for a diverse range of colorful fruits and vegetables. Parents frequently prioritize dark leafy greens, antioxidant-rich blueberries and healthy-fat-packed avocados. 

However, there's one nutritional powerhouse that often gets overlooked: beans. Here's why I wish more parents fed this underrated superfood to their kids. 

Beans, in all their varied forms, are an exceptional source of plant-based protein. Many bean varieties contain all the essential amino acids that are vital for supporting a child's energy, growth and active lifestyle. 

Beans are also loaded with both soluble and insoluble fiber, a duo that's a game-changer for digestive health. Insoluble fiber promotes regular bowel movements, preventing constipation and keeping things moving smoothly. Soluble fiber contributes to that feeling of fullness and satiety after a meal, which can be helpful in managing appetite and preventing overeating. 

Soluble fiber also plays a role in lowering LDL, or "bad" cholesterol levels, and helps to stabilize blood sugar fluctuations after meals, preventing those dreaded energy crashes.

Beans are naturally fortified with an impressive array of essential vitamins and minerals. 

They are also a fantastic source of folate, which is vital for cell growth and development, as well as iron, which is crucial for carrying oxygen throughout the body. 

Plus, they're packed with magnesium for nerve and muscle function, and a range of B vitamins that support energy production and brain health.

Soybeans in particular have a good amount of healthy fats in them, like omega 3 and omega 6 fats that support heart and brain health. 

Beyond their nutritional profile, beans offer practical advantages. They are very affordable, making them accessible to families on any budget. Their long shelf life means you can stock up and always have a healthy meal option on hand. 

Additionally, incorporating beans into our diets is an environmentally-friendly choice. They have a lower carbon footprint compared to many animal protein sources, contributing to a more sustainable food system.

Of course, all the nutritional knowledge in the world won't make a difference if kids refuse to eat what's offered. This is where the magic of beans truly shines. 

I've found that many children genuinely enjoy the taste and texture of beans, and they are remarkably easy to prepare in various kid-friendly ways.

For younger children or more picky eaters, start with something simple and approachable, like steaming edamame (young soybeans) or adding black beans to a cheesy quesadilla. I've even found success with black bean-based brownies, a surprisingly delicious and nutritious treat. 

For more adventurous eaters, consider introducing lentil soups, flavorful bean chili or stews. The versatility of beans makes them easy to incorporate into a wide range of dishes, ensuring there's a bean recipe out there for everyone.

D-Wave Quantum's latest quantum computing system has hit the market, the company said Tuesday. The company's shares popped 32%.

The quantum computer, known as Advantage2, marks its sixth iteration and most advanced system, the company said.

"It's an engineering marvel, with substantial technical advancements that highlight D-Wave's progress in scaling quantum technology to meet industry demands for growing computational processing power while maintaining energy efficiency," said CEO Alan Baratz in a press release.

D-Wave said the computer, accessible through its cloud service, offers a 40% boost in energy scale, and reduces noise by 75%. Advantage2 also uses an updated system with 20-way connectivity that can use fewer qubits to solve problems. A qubit, or quantum bit, refers to a unit used to encode data in quantum computers.

Recent quantum announcements from major technology giants have boosted optimism in the sector that promises to solve intricate computing tasks unachievable by regular computers.

Google debuted its latest quantum computing chip known as "Willow" in December, while Microsoft launched its first quantum chip earlier this year.

But some quantum experts and tech CEOs have cast doubt on how soon quantum applications can hit the market.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in January said that 15 years was on the "early side" for "very useful" quantum computers, sending quantum stocks spiraling. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg also tempered expectations for the sector.

Huang later walked back those comments at a company event in March, with D-Wave's Baratz and other quantum executives in attendance. Baratz told CNBC shortly after the initial comments that Huang was "dead wrong" about quantum computing.

Other quantum computing stocks edged higher on the news, including Quantum Computing, Rigetti Computing and IonQ.

Levi Strauss has agreed to sell Dockers to brand management firm Authentic Brands Group for $311 million, the companies announced Tuesday. 

Under the terms of the deal, Authentic will own Dockers' intellectual property while Centric Brands will take on operations, handling manufacturing, sourcing and distribution. Under the brand management business model, Levi's stands to make up to $391 million in future years based on how well Dockers performs under the Authentic umbrella, which also includes Forever 21's intellectual property and brands like Reebok and Nautica.

"The Dockers transaction further aligns our portfolio with our strategic priorities, focusing on our direct-to-consumer first approach, growing our international presence and investing in opportunities across women's and denim lifestyle," Levi's CEO Michelle Gass said in a statement. "After a robust process, we are confident that we maximized the value of the business and that Authentic is the right organization to usher in the next chapter of growth for the Dockers brand." 

In October, Levi's announced it was considering selling Dockers as it looked to focus on growing its namesake line and its athleisure brand, Beyond Yoga. Levi's created Dockers in 1986 as a hedge against denim and to offer consumers an alternative: khakis. The brand was hugely popular throughout the 1990s and 2000s, but khakis have since fallen out of fashion in the U.S., especially recently as denim makes another comeback. 

To grow Dockers, Levi's needed to offer more tops and bottoms, but the company is doing the same thing at its namesake banner and there was too much overlap between the two brands. Dockers' performance was also dragging down Levi's results and Gass, who took the helm of the company a little over a year ago, has been working to cut off extraneous businesses to fuel growth and focus on direct selling. 

In the three months ended March 2, Levi's reported $67 million in revenue related to Dockers. The figure isn't comparable to the year-ago period because Levi's only recently started breaking out the performance of each individual brand. 

While khakis have fallen out of favor in the U.S., Dockers is still popular abroad, which is what makes a brand management company a strategic fit, according to people who have seen Dockers' financials and spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were private. Firms like Authentic are skilled at rapidly licensing and deploying brands internationally.

In a press release, Authentic said it plans to "unlock new opportunities" for Dockers through its global network of 1,700 licensing partners. It said it is in active discussions with regional operators in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia to expand Dockers' existing businesses across those markets. 

"Few brands own a category the way Dockers does, yet still have so much room to grow," said Matt Maddox, president at Authentic. "Its legacy in casualwear gives it a strong foundation, but the real opportunity lies in reimagining the brand for a new generation. Through our global platform and deep licensing network, we're committed to stewarding the brand into its next era of growth and relevance."

Home Depot on Tuesday stuck by its full-year sales forecast as a top executive told CNBC the retailer doesn't plan to hike prices because of tariffs.

"Because of our scale, the great partnerships we have with our suppliers and productivity that we continue to drive in our business, we intend to generally maintain our current pricing levels across our portfolio," Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail told CNBC in an interview.

More than half of what the company sells comes from the U.S., he said. McPhail added that Home Depot and its suppliers have worked to diversify the source of the company's imports over the past several years, including by decreasing the share of purchases that come from China. By this time next year, no single country outside of the U.S. will represent more than 10% of the company's purchases, he said.

Home Depot's pricing strategy is at odds with Walmart, which said last week that it would have to raise prices as soon as late May to cover higher costs from tariffs. The decision to keep prices the same — at least for now — also comes as a sluggish housing market causes the retailer's sales to stagnate.

On an earnings call, McPhail said Home Depot has the scale and flexibility to manage higher tariffs, but added that keeping prices stable could also help its business.

"It's a great opportunity for us to take share, and it's a great opportunity for our suppliers to take share as well," he said.

McPhail made his comments as Home Depot posted results for the fiscal first quarter, after weeks in which a range of corporations have either revised or withdrawn their financial guidance due to President Donald Trump's rapidly changing tariffs. The home improvement retailer missed Wall Street's first-quarter earnings expectations for the first time since May 2020, but beat sales estimates.

The retailer is still waiting for dynamics that could drive stronger spending and bigger purchases.

On an earnings call, CEO Ted Decker said "stubbornly high" interest and mortgage rates and consumers' uncertainty about the economy have dampened home improvement spending.

"People are painting again and working in their yards and doing smaller projects, but just have not engaged in the larger projects," he said.

For the full year, Home Depot said it expects total sales to grow by 2.8% and comparable sales, which take out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and calendar differences, to rise about 1%. Its forecast is based on the continuation of a U.S. agreement to temporarily lower tariffs to 30% on imports from China and to 10% for many other countries.

Here's what Home Depot reported for the fiscal first quarter compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Shares of the company rose slightly in morning trading.

In the three-month period that ended May 4, Home Depot's net income was $3.43 billion, or $3.45 per share, compared with $3.60 billion, or $3.63 per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share exclude some costs, including the impact of depreciation from acquired intangible assets.

Spring is Home Depot's peak sales season — the Christmas of the home improvement world — as homeowners and contractors typically tackle more projects because of warmer and dryer weather. Yet even with that seasonal boost, the backdrop for Home Depot remains tough as more U.S. consumers put off home purchases or major renovation projects because of higher mortgage rates and costs of borrowing.

Sales growth has been muted. In the fiscal first quarter, comparable sales dropped 0.3% across the company. In the U.S., comparable sales increased 0.2% year over year.

That trend has been persistent, with the exception of the previous quarter. Home Depot snapped eight consecutive quarters of falling comparable sales in the fourth quarter. In that quarter, comparable sales increased 0.8% across the company.

Sales patterns improved as the quarter went on, McPhail said. Comparable sales declined 3.3% year over year in February, increased 1.3% from the prior-year period in March and rose 1.8% year over year in April, he said. 

He attributed negative sales results in February to poor weather. 

"We clawed our way back through the remainder of the quarter and had a great April, and we've seen the level of customer engagement that we saw in April continue into the first few weeks of May," he said.

As Home Depot stares down a more challenging housing backdrop, the company has chased more business from home professionals. It acquired SRS Distribution, a Texas-based company that sells supplies to roofing, pool and landscaping professionals, last year in a $18.25 billion deal.

Sales for Home Depot – including SRS – grew roughly 9% year over year in the first quarter from $36.42 billion in the year-ago quarter. About $2.6 billion of that year-over-year gain came from SRS' business, and a portion of sales growth came from new stores, McPhail told CNBC.

In the fiscal first quarter, customer transactions across Home Depot's website and stores rose 2.1% year over year. Average ticket, which measures the amount of spending on those store or website visits, was $90.71, just a few cents above the average in the year-ago quarter. 

Compared with other retailers, Home Depot caters to a more affluent U.S. consumer who tends to be employed and to have benefited from the sharp increase of property values since 2019, McPhail said. About 80% of its customers are homeowners, he said, and the home professionals who buy from Home Depot cater to homeowners who hire them to tackle projects from roofing and electrical work to a kitchen remodel.

"Our customer is healthy, and we think that's what has supported their level of engagement in home improvement," he said.

Even so, McPhail said that do-it-yourself customers are tending to defer bigger projects and engaging in smaller and spring-related projects. 

Home Depot saw a positive response to its spring Black Friday event and strong sales in the appliance, garden, plumbing and electrical departments, McPhail said. But he added sales have been softer in areas including kitchen countertops and bath – categories that tend to be purchased as part of pricier projects like renovations and remodels.

As of Monday's close, Home Depot's shares are down about 2% so far this year. That trails behind the S&P 500's gains of approximately 1% during the same period. Its shares closed at $379.38 on Monday, bringing its market value to about $377 billion.

The intense trade war with the U.S. has left lasting scars on Chinese exporters with many looking to diversify away from the U.S., despite the temporary tariff reprieves, a private survey found.

Based on a poll of 4,500 exporters across several major economies, trade insurer Allianz Trade found that 95% of Chinese exporters surveyed are planning on, if not already, doubling down on exporting to markets outside the U.S. for their goods.

The U.S.-China "decoupling" remains a likely scenario over the medium term, the survey said, as Chinese exporters look to pivot away from the U.S. and American firms accelerate efforts to shift production out of China.

An increasing number of firms surveyed are expecting a dent on export turnover this year due to the double-digit U.S. tariffs, the report said.

Even after the temporary tariff reduction following Beijing-Washington's deal in Switzerland earlier this month, the U.S. trade-weighted tariff rate on Chinese goods remained at 39%, well above the 13% rate applied before the second Trump administration, according to Allianz Trade estimates.

The rapid de-escalation of the tariff spat has led to a large spike in U.S.-bound shipments as exporters front-load orders during the 90-day grace period, pushing up freight rates.

Chinese exporters in the coastal city of Ningbo are undeterred by the truce, and sticking with their plans to "go global", said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at Economist Intelligence Unit.

In a recent report on a field visit to the city, which hosts China's second largest port by cargo handled after Shanghai, Xu said Southeast Asia remained the top choice among local businesses seeking to move production overseas.

For Southeast Asia, companies show growing interests in setting up production in Indonesia, Xu said. On the other hand, perception was mixed about Vietnam, with concerns over rising costs weighing against an attractive labor force.

While the U.S. has hammered out trade deals with China and the U.K, talks with other long trading partners seem to have stalled.

Allianz Trade points out a sobering reality that global exports could see a loss of $305 billion this year on the back of the widespread trade conflicts.

In comparison, global trade hit a record $33 trillion last year, according to the United Nations Trade and Development.

A new book details how launching ChatGPT propelled OpenAI from a scrappy startup to a corporate juggernaut.

This is an excerpt from "Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman's OpenAI" by Karen Hao.

The book is based on interviews with around 260 people and an extensive trove of correspondence and documents. Any quoted emails, documents, or Slack messages come from copies or screenshots of those documents and correspondences or are exactly as they appear in lawsuits.

The author reached out to all of the key figures and companies that are described in this book to seek interviews and comment. OpenAI and Sam Altman chose not to cooperate.

In November 2022, rumors began to spread within OpenAI that its rival Anthropic was testing — and would soon release — a new chatbot. If it didn't launch first, OpenAI risked losing its leading position, which could deliver a big hit to morale for employees who had worked long and tough hours to retain that dominance.

Anthropic had not in fact been planning any imminent releases. But for OpenAI executives, the rumors were enough to trigger a decision: The company wouldn't wait to ready GPT-4 into a chatbot; it would release John Schulman's chat-enabled GPT-3.5 model with the Superassistant team's brand-new chat interface in two weeks, right after Thanksgiving.

No one truly fathomed the societal phase shift they were about to unleash. They expected the chatbot to be a flash in the pan. The night before the release, they placed bets on how many users might try the tool by the end of the weekend. Some people guessed a few thousand. Others guessed tens of thousands. To be safe, the infrastructure team provisioned enough server capacity for 100,000 users.

On Wednesday, November 30, most employees didn't even realize that the launch had happened. But the following day, the number of users began to surge.

The instant runaway success of ChatGPT was beyond what anyone at OpenAI had dreamed of. It would leave the company's engineers and researchers completely miffed even years later. GPT-3.5 hadn't been that much of a capability improvement over GPT-3, which had already been out for two years. And GPT-3.5 had already been available to developers.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman later said that he'd believed ChatGPT would be popular but by something like "one order of magnitude less." "It was shocking that people liked it," a former employee remembers. "To all of us, they'd downgraded the thing we'd been using internally and launched it."

Within five days, OpenAI cofounder Greg Brockman tweeted that ChatGPT had crossed one million users. Within two months, it had reached 100 million, becoming what was then the fastest-growing consumer app in history. ChatGPT catapulted OpenAI from a hot startup well-known within the tech industry into a household name overnight.

At the same time, it was this very blockbuster success that would place extraordinary strain on the company. Over the course of a year, it would polarize its factions further and wind up the stress and tension within the organization to an explosive level.

By then, the company had just 300 employees. With every team stretched dangerously thin, managers begged Altman for more head count. There was no shortage of candidates. After ChatGPT, the number of applicants clamoring to join the rocket ship had rapidly multiplied. But Altman worried about what would happen to company culture and mission alignment if the company scaled up its staff too quickly. He believed firmly in maintaining a small staff and high talent density. "We are now in a position where it's tempting to let the organization grow extremely large," he had written in his 2020 vision memo, in reference to Microsoft's investment. "We should try very hard to resist this — what has worked for us so far is being small, focused, high-trust, low-bullshit, and intense. The overhead of too many people and too much bureaucracy can easily kill great ideas or result in sclerosis."

He was now repeating this to executives in late 2022, emphasizing during head count discussions the need to keep the company lean and the talent bar high, and add no more than 100 or so hires. Other executives balked. At the rate that their teams were burning out, many saw the need for something closer to around 500 or even more new people.

Over several weeks, the executive team finally compromised on a number somewhere in the middle, between 250 and 300. The cap didn't hold. By summer, there were as many as 30, even 50, people joining OpenAI each week, including more recruiters to scale up hiring even faster. By fall, the company had blown well past its own self-imposed quota.

The sudden growth spurt indeed changed company culture. A recruiter wrote a manifesto about how the pressure to hire so quickly was forcing his team to lower the quality bar for talent. "If you want to build Meta, you're doing a great job," he said in a pointed jab at Altman, alluding to the very fears that the CEO had warned about.

The rapid expansion was also leading to an uptick in firings. During his onboarding, one manager was told to swiftly document and report any underperforming members of his team, only to be let go himself sometime later. Terminations were rarely communicated to the rest of the company. People routinely discovered that colleagues had been fired only by noticing when a Slack account grayed out from being deactivated. They began calling it "getting disappeared."

To new hires, fully bought into the idea that they were joining a fast-moving, money-making startup, the tumult felt like a particularly chaotic, at times brutal, manifestation of standard corporate problems: poor management, confusing priorities, the coldhearted ruthlessness of a capitalistic company willing to treat its employees as disposable. "There was a huge lack of psychological safety," says a former employee who joined during this era. Many people coming aboard were simply holding on for dear life until their one-year mark to get access to the first share of their equity. One significant upside: They still felt their colleagues were among the highest caliber in the tech industry, which, combined with the seemingly boundless resources and unparalleled global impact, could spark a feeling of magic difficult to find in the rest of the industry when things actually aligned. "OpenAI is one of the best places I've ever worked but also probably one of the worst," the former employee says.

For some employees who remembered the scrappy early days of OpenAI as a tight-knit, mission-driven nonprofit, its dramatic transformation into a big, faceless corporation was far more shocking and emotional. Gone was the organization as they'd known it; in its place was something unrecognizable. "OpenAI is Burning Man," Rob Mallery, a former recruiter, says, referring to how the desert art festival scaled to the point that it lost touch with its original spirit. "I know it meant a lot more to the people who were there at the beginning than it does to everyone now."

In those early years, the team had set up a Slack channel called #explainlikeimfive that allowed employees to submit anonymous questions about technical topics. With the company pushing 600 people, the channel also turned into a place for airing anonymous grievances.

In mid-2023, an employee posted that the company was hiring too many people not aligned with the mission or passionate about building AGI.

Another person responded: They knew OpenAI was going downhill once it started hiring people who could look you in the eye.

As OpenAI was rapidly professionalizing and gaining more exposure and scrutiny, incoherence at the top was becoming more consequential. The company was no longer just the Applied and Research divisions. Now there were several public-facing departments: In addition to the communications team, a legal team was writing legal opinions and dealing with a growing number of lawsuits. The policy team was stretching out across continents. Increasingly, OpenAI needed to communicate with one narrative and voice to its constituents, and it needed to determine its positions to articulate them. But on numerous occasions, the lack of strategic clarity was leading to confused public messaging.

At the end of 2023, The New York Times would sue OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement for training on millions of its articles. OpenAI's response in early January, written by the legal team, delivered an unusually feisty hit back, accusing the Times of "intentionally manipulating our models" to generate evidence for its argument. That same week, OpenAI's policy team delivered a submission to the UK House of Lords communications and digital select committee, saying that it would be "impossible" for OpenAI to train its cutting-edge models without copyrighted materials. After the media zeroed in on the word impossible, OpenAI hastily walked away from the language.

"There's just so much confusion all the time," says an employee in a public-facing department. While some of that reflects the typical growing pains of startups, OpenAI's profile and reach have well outpaced the relatively early stage of the company, the employee adds. "I don't know if there is a strategic priority in the C suite. I honestly think people just make their own decisions. And then suddenly it starts to look like a strategic decision but it's actually just an accident. Sometimes there isn't a plan as much as there is just chaos."

Key Takeaways:

Ethereum is forming a bull flag on the daily chart, with a potential breakout above $3,600.

If ETH reclaims the 2-week Gaussian Channel mid-line, a 90% rally could occur.

Ethereum ETHUSD price is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,750 on its daily chart, forming a bull flag pattern with sights on the $3,000 to $3,100 resistance zone. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that follows a sharp rally (black flagpole) to $2,730 from $1,900, with the current range forming the flag. 

A bullish breakout above $2,600 could target $3,600, which is calculated by adding the flagpole height to the breakout point, but the immediate key area of interest remains between the resistance range at $3,100-$3,000. 

The 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) supports the lower range. The relative strength index (RSI), although still near the overbought region, has significantly cooled over the past few days. 

An ETH breakout with rising RSI and volume could confirm the bullish move, while a drop below $2,400 risks invalidating the pattern.

Can Ether reclaim the Gaussian Channel midline?

On May 20, Ether showed a significant trend shift as it attempted to reclaim the mid-line of the 2-week Gaussian Channel, a technical indicator used to identify price trends. The Gaussian or Normal Distribution Channel plots price movements within a dynamic range, adapting to market volatility. 

Historically, when ETH crosses above this mid-line, significant rallies often follow. In 2023, ETH surged 93% to $4,000 after a similar crossover, while in 2020, it skyrocketed by 1,820%, sparking a massive altcoin rally.

Conversely, a similar setup in August 2022 led to an invalidation during a market correction, highlighting the risks of relying solely on this indicator. 

Likewise, crypto trader Merlijn noted a golden cross between the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA (simple moving average), which could further strengthen an imminent ETH breakout. It is important to note that the golden cross is on a 12-hour chart, which is less dependable than the one-day chart.

Traders exercise caution ahead of possible ‘range-bound environment'

Popular crypto trader XO noted that Ethereum is consolidating under a “decent” resistance level below the $2,800 mark. The trader expects a correction if ETH cannot break above $2,800 over the next few days. The analyst said,

A contrarian outlook to bulls can also be observed with ETH prices oscillating under the Fibonacci levels. Cointelegraph reported that Ether recently retested the 0.5 to 0.618 Fib levels, which could trigger a short-term correction for ETH. 

In such a scenario, the immediate area of support remains around $2,150 and $1,900, possibly slowing down the bullish momentum for a prolonged period.

Energy storage company KULR Technology Group has bought an additional $9 million Bitcoin for its corporate treasury, the company announced Tuesday, part of a recent surge of companies that have been building treasuries of the digital asset.  

Publicly traded KULR, which has headquarters in Houston, now holds 800.3 tokens worth about $85 million, based on current pricing. 

The company bought its latest Bitcoin at an average price of $103,234 per token. Bitcoin was recently trading at roughly $106,200, up about a percentage point over the past 24 hours and more than 25% over the past month, according to crypto markets data provider CoinGecko.

KULR is trading at $1.24 as of writing time, down 3% over the past 24 hours.

Multiple companies have added to their Bitcoin stores in recent months amid an upturn in wider crypto markets that has dovetailed with the re-election of Donald Trump, who has been supportive of the industry. On Monday, Michael Saylor's software firm Strategy and Tokyo-based Metaplanet upped their Bitcoin holdings by $764.9 and $104.8 million, respectively. 

Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, now holds more than 576,000 Bitcoin worth about $61 billion based on current prices, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. Japan-based Metaplanet holds about 7,800 Bitcoin worth over $826 million.

KULR debuted its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy last December, less than a month after self-billed pro-crypto President Donald Trump's re-election kicked off a digital assets trading frenzy in the U.S. The firm's strategy calls for its team to hold up to 90% of its surplus cash reserves in Bitcoin—a plan other public companies, including California-based ThumzUp Media, have emulated over the past few months. 

The company provides energy management products and services, including battery and thermal energy systems, for the aerospace, space and defense industries. 

The firm's latest Bitcoin buy also comes a few days ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's highly publicized dinner with more than 200 top holders of his meme coin, Official Trump. Bitcoin was recently trading at $104,699 — less than $5,00 shy of its highest price, CoinGecko data shows.

Amid that Trump-fueled crypto market rally, several public and private companies are stocking their treasuries with the world's oldest cryptocurrency.

 One Bitcoin trader says “price discovery” will be “inches away” if BTC bulls manage to liquidate $3 billion in short positions. 

Key takeaways:

An end-of-month Bitcoin price close above $102,400 would set the highest monthly close ever, proving the bull market continues at a rapid pace.

Over $3 billion in Bitcoin short positions are vulnerable above $107,000, creating a “liquidation magnet” that could send BTC price to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) is 11 days from potentially setting its highest monthly candle close in history. After achieving a record weekly close of $106,407 on May 18, BTC could secure a new monthly high by closing above $102,400 this month.

With respect to its current market trend, Bitcoin is inches away from a ‘price discovery' period, as noted by crypto trader Jelle.

Price discovery in this context refers to the process where buyers and sellers interact at an undefined or non-traded range to determine the market price of an asset.

A break above Bitcoin's all-time high of $110,000 would initiate a price discovery phase, driving BTC into an uncharted trading range with successive higher highs until market participants establish a new equilibrium between supply and demand.

Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin is close to confirming a “golden cross” on its daily chart, which has historically preceded 45% to 60% price rallies. Such a move coincides with the probability of BTC hitting new highs this month.

A monthly close near $110,000 would mark a 15% to 17% gain for Bitcoin in May, its strongest May performance since 2019. This would significantly surpass the historical average monthly return of 8% for the month.

Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. has noted a key technical pattern in Bitcoin's current bull cycle, pointing to three recent instances of “compression”—a period of tightening price ranges—measured by rolling maximum/minimum over 180 days.

The chart indicates that this compression often signals an impending breakout, with historical precedent set by the 2017 rally when Bitcoin surged to $20,000 from $1,000.

Using Bollinger Bands alongside the price range suggests that volatility is building within the current cycle. The third compression phase in 2025 mirrors the 2017 cycle, where the Bitcoin halving events and supply shocks fueled retail FOMO, driving major price rallies. 

From the vantage point of Bitcoin liquidation, over $3 billion in short leveraged positions are at risk of being liquidated if BTC price moves to $110,000 from $105,000. In contrast, it would take a drop to $94,612 to trigger a similar amount in long liquidations. This skew suggests a higher probability of the price pushing upward to chase liquidity on the sell-side rather than dropping lower.

Technical analyst Gert van Lagen noted a similar outlook, stating,

The Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation gathered in Jackson Hole on May 14 and 15 for its first meeting of the interim. They discussed topics like right to repair and AI in government, and heard updates from the Wyoming Stable Token Commission. The committee's next meeting will be July 10 in Casper.

Blockchain updates

The executive director of the Wyoming Stable Token Commission, Anthony Apollo, provided the committee with updates on the progress of the Wyoming Stable Token. The commission is still prepared for a July 4 release date.

Apollo described the token as a “virtual currency, representative of and redeemable for $1 U.S., held in trust by Wyoming.”

The commission went out of its way to emphasize the definition of the stable token as a token, citing some public officials' belief that the token is a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Last year, the Legislature passed a bill prohibiting state agencies from requiring payment in the form of CBCDs and from using public funds to help test a CBCD, which Apollo referenced in defense of the token.

“Despite that clarification and the very clear delineation between CBDC and what we're doing, we still had [Rep.] Tom Emmer (R-Minnesota), who serves as the GOP majority whip, characterize our offering as a CBDC,” said Apollo.

Emmer in March told the technology media company Decrypt, “I respect the vote of the Wyoming people, however, I personally am vehemently against any government issuing a tokenized version of its currency … At the federal level, this would be considered a central bank digital currency.”

Committee Cochair Sen. Chris Rothfuss (D-Laramie) said the committee should do more to rectify misunderstandings like these.

"I think we can do a lot to be a little proactive in communicating to stakeholders a little bit about our stable token, and how it isn't a CBDC, and how it is backed, and how it's not mining a new currency," said Rothfuss.

Apollo also announced the commission is accepting public comments on proposed rules for procurement and public records requestsuntil May 27, and on proposed rules for reserves management through June 30.

Alongside public comment, the stabletoken is currently in an “alpha phase” or test pilot phase, with mock tokens that currently hold no value being tested on multiple platforms.

Between these two milestones, Apollo said that Wyoming was in a unique position.

“If we are able to promulgate our rules set first, this will be the first rule set around stable coins in the United States of America,” said Apollo.



Committee Cochair Rep. Dainel Singh (R-Cheyenne) was interested in the future of tokens, asking Apollo about tokenized real world assets.

“There is interest, conversation that's being had in perhaps expanding the scope of what the stable token is able to do, [if it is] able to represent things like gold or any other commodity, such as oil or rare earth minerals.hat are your thoughts on that?” Singh asked.

“I've been in this industry for about 10 years,” said Apollo in response. [There's] always kind of seasons. It was NFTs [non-fungible tokens], it was DeFi [decentralized finance], it's been DAOs [decentralized autonomous organization], now it's stable coins. We've seen a large proliferation of this industry, but if I had to put my money down, I do think that real-world assets are next.”

AI in government

Lawmakers also spent time hearing from experts in the artificial intelligence industry and reviewing how other states are handling developments.

Rep. Lee Filer (R-Cheyenne) said “it's in our communities” referring to AI. He suggested everyone in the room had at least one interaction with AI. Filer inquired as to how to protect individuals from abuse while not over-regulating an emerging industry. Rothfuss held similar concerns.

Dazza Greenwood, a legal tech consultant and researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab, gave a presentation to the committee on the current state of AI. After Greenwood's presentation, Rothfuss expressed concern about generative AI's massive resource usage for both illegal activity and combating illegal activity.

“It seems like, regrettably, the counter to [AI phishing emails] is to now employ AI to try to counter AI actively in this space, leading to the near-term heat death of the universe as a response to just trying to get through e-mail fraud. I mean, is there a better approach to it than that, or is that the direction we're currently headed?” asked Rothfuss.



“I'm pretty confident that that's where we're headed … but at the same time, I'm also confident that there's countermeasures that we can find,” said Greenwood.

Greenwood suggested workers adopt similar security measures to those of military members operating “behind enemy lines.”

“But now, civilians should learn how to have a safe word, one that they do not ever tell anybody else so you can distinguish whether the entity that's called you on the phone that … sounds just like your cousin and … maybe looks like your cousin on video, that you have some last ditch way to disambiguate them.”

The committee said it's interested in crafting legislation to address these concerns. Filer said he was interested in two other state legislatures' approaches to AI. One is California Senate Bill 813, which created public-private entities to oversee AI makers. The other is the Texas Legislature's creation of an AI council.

Right-to-repair

Another focus for the committee is right-to-repair (RTR). RTR concerns a consumer's ability to repair equipment without depending on the parts or repair that is only available through the original manufacturer of the product. Laws related to RTR can impact farmers, iPhone users and even military equipment.

The committee heard from five members of the public, all speaking in favor of right-to-repair laws, including I-Fix-It CEO Kyle Wiens. Lawmakers asked him if right-to-repair laws have incentivised some manufacturers to “tap out” of a market, specifically in Colorado, after the state passed RTR legislation.

“No, they have not,” said Wiens. “We see them continue to sell. I think they're more interested in violating the statute and then dealing with that through legal means later than withdrawing from a market."

Lawmakers appeared in agreement and intent on pursuing right-to-repair legislation in the interest of local farmers and ranchers. While the committee did not draft legislation this time around, Singh and Rothfuss appear equally intent on bringing regulations “to empower” and not “to restrict” growing sectors like AI and blockchain.

Société Générale's crypto arm, SG Forge, is reportedly preparing to launch a dollar-backed stablecoin on Ethereum, making it the first global banking group to issue a public stablecoin tied to the U.S. dollar.

SG Forge's dollar stablecoin would be publicly accessible on Ethereum, with additional support for Solana to follow. The launch is expected in the coming weeks, according to a report by French publication The Big Whale.

The move would expand SG Forge's footprint in the digital asset space following the 2023 debut of its euro stablecoin, EURCV.

The token would initially serve institutional investors, leveraging SG Forge's e-money license to operate legally across the European Union, according to the report.

The shift would come amid accelerating stablecoin adoption. World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance project backed by the family of U.S. President Donald Trump, has launched its own dollar-denominated stablecoin, USD1, which has been used to settle MGX's $2 billion investment in Binance.

Banks, according to BitGo's managing director of stablecoin Ben Reynolds, are exploring stablecoins in a bid to avoid being outpaced by cryptocurrency-native competitors. These financial institutions are needed to unlock the full potential of these tokens, PayPal's crypto head Jose Fernandez da Ponte said at Consensus 2025 in Toronto.

SG Forge's euro-denominated stablecoin, EURCV, currently has a market capitalization of around $46.5 million, far behind competitors including Circle's EURC token, whose market cap exceeds $237 million. Euro-denominated tokens represent a fraction of the $243 billion stablecoin market.

U.S. dollar stablecoins dominate the ecosystem, with Circle's USDC commanding a $60.6 billion market cap, behind the market leader USDT, Tether's flagship stablecoin with a $151.6 billion market cap.

SG Forge declined to comment.

UK Information Commissioner John Edwards is on a bit of a speaking tour, having recently addressed Privacy New Zealand – a country where he spent eight years serving as privacy commissioner – and the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)'s Data Protection Intensive UK 2025.

His message is a mix of human-centric thinking and a warning to services that flout the rules, guided by the principle that “data protection is not just about computers, numbers and legislation – it's about people.”

Edwards tells the IAPP that “since I arrived in the UK and took up this role in 2022, my aim has been to regulate for outcomes, not outputs. I'm interested in real impact, real change, rather than products, things that might be easy to count, but that ultimately don't improve the lives or experiences of people in the UK.”

He cites real scenarios in which irresponsible data handling leading to data breaches can have grave consequences: “Imagine a person fleeing a violent domestic relationship, only to have their new address accidentally shared with their abuser.” Rather than a mere “admin error”, Edwards wants to frame these mistakes within a wider social context, notably in how they impact people in vulnerable positions.

He believes “the public should not be expected to have to read reams of legalese in a privacy notice to understand what's happening to their information,” that “they should not be kept in the dark about where their information's going and what it's being used for,” and that “they should not be coerced or forced into handing over their information without being fully informed about the consequences.”

While consumers can play a role in the larger task of data protection, Edwards says “there is a limit. It's the responsibility of the whole organisation, from the C-suite down, to keep things simple and accessible for their users.”

To illustrate the role of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), Edwards points to its ongoing investigations into TikTok, Reddit and Imgur.

“Our role is to ask questions on behalf of young people, so they don't have to make complex decisions about how they transact with their personal information in an asymmetric information relationship,” Edwards says.

“How do these platforms protect children's personal information? How do their recommender systems work, how are they using a 13 year old's preferences, viewing habits, shares and likes to serve them content, and keep them on the platform? And, in the case of Reddit and Imgur, how do they assess the age of their users and tailor their content accordingly?”

From age assurance to consent in the collection of personal data, “children shouldn't have to figure this out by themselves. It's not their job.”

“So we've stepped in, because it's our job as the UK's data protection regulator to hold these platforms to account. If social media and video sharing platforms want to benefit from operating in the UK, they must comply with data protection law.”

The decision to target three of the biggest social media and video sharing platforms is intentional – and definitely not a signal for smaller businesses to ignore the law.

“I want to make it very clear,” Edwards says. “By focusing our efforts on some of the largest, most well known platforms, we are not giving smaller companies a free pass to adopt or continue unlawful practices. Instead, last week's announcement should serve as a warning shot. All organisations using children's data, or who offer products or services aimed at young people, need to comply with the law and conform with our children's code.”

“Get your own house in order. You shouldn't wait for the regulator to come knocking on your door before checking your processes.”

Edwards says the ICO continues to focus on AI and biometrics continues. “I've asked my team to look at foundation models, automated decision-making in recruitment and by government and how police forces use facial recognition technology. We'll be closely scrutinising any proposed deployment of predictive profiling that could affect people's rights.”

We're also looking ahead at the technologies and innovations that are likely to burst onto the scene in the next two to seven years.”

Edwards' address to Privacy New Zealand focuses on the ICO's work in childrens' online safety.

He says the age appropriate design code, which he “inherited,” has “directly led to a huge number of improvements in the safety of a number of the most popular platforms and digital services available to children.”

“One of the largest platforms told me that as a result of the code and our work, they made more changes to their product products than they did when the GDPR came in, and that's huge.” He cites wins like turning off geolocation for kids by default and turning off notifications after bedtime.

Edwards reiterates that the ICO's priorities for the year are children online, AI and biometrics –  regarding the latter, “there's a real rush to market which means that there are risks and opportunities and we need to stay ahead of those – and, finally, online tracking and advertising.

He mentions policy work consulting on papers addressing “some of the personal information implications of generative AI and how large language models are trained.”

Edwards has fines at his disposal, if needed. But he stresses that real change takes time.

“I've started to use the example that one of the first decisions I took in my job here in 2022 was to confirm a fine my predecessor proposed against Clearview AI ,which you know is the biometric facial recognition matching service used by law enforcement authorities based on scraped images from around the web.”

Clearview appealed that fine and won, forcing the ICO to seek its own appeal. “It took the tribunal a year to respond to our request for an appeal,” Edwards says. “We've now got a date for that appeal. I‘m three and a half years into my term now; there is no chance that that matter will be determined before my term ends.”

Edwards also makes brief reference to Australia's social media ban for users under 16. Once again, his human-centric perspective guides his thinking.

“I think one of the most sensible things I've heard on this subject came from a real advocate who's sometimes a pretty harsh critic of my office and  me personally, and the role that we play.”

Edwards is referring to Baroness Beeban Kidron, who he calls “really the author of the kids code in many ways.”

“She was asked about this issue of a ban and her view I think was really sensible. She said it's better to make these technologies safe for children than to try and ban them. And I think that's right.”

That said, parental oversight only goes so far. “The thing is I wonder, you know, we expect that parents will not give their children cigarettes right? But we also make it a crime for retailers to sell children under 18 cigarettes. And I think there is an analogy there.”

Ethereum cofounder Jeffrey Wilcke might be on the verge of selling around $262 million ETH on the open market. According to data insights from Arkham Intelligence, the early Ethereum developer sent 105,732 ETH to Kraken cryptocurrency ecosystem.

According to the Arkham data, the transfer was carried out at block height number 22524638 with a total fee of 0.000063 ETH valued at $0.16. This transaction has sparked a potential sell-off concern as Kraken is generally known as the platform whales use to liquidate their holdings.

Ethereum Whales Are Back out of Nowhere

ByGamza Khanzadaev





Ethereum's price is yet to break through the $2,500 mark, as volatility continues to play a part. However, Wilcke timed the transaction to coincide with a 1.56% rebound to $2,490.44. 

Over the past 24 hours, the price of the top altcoin dropped to a low of $2,452 before rebounding. Ethereum whales are generally always active, considering its stable liquidity and broad markets.

Besides Jeffrey Wilcke, high-volume transfers have been linked to Justin Sun and the Ethereum Foundation recently.

Related transfers are often signs of distress in the ecosystem. While the ETH price is staging a recovery overall, if more related whale transfers are unchecked, it can trigger another unexpected drawdown.

Already, Ethereum's price has yet to return to its highest for the day, pegged at $2,585 atop a 3.26% drop over the past week.

The impact of the Pectra upgrade is also fading fast, as there are reports of a possible bug threat in EIP-7702. Overall, market experts are watching the trends, especially with the possibility that the Jeffrey Wilcke transfer has other unknown purposes, like custody.

The King of Pigs ($KOPS), built on the most robust BSC chain, has kick-started its ICO on May 17th, giving traders and cryptocurrency enthusiasts a unique investment opportunity. With the token selling for just $0.001, right now is the best chance for investors to get involved and see the rewards of increasing popularity. The King of Pigs ($KOPS) coin is attracting much attention because the project offers a unique referral program, generous bonuses, and the KOPS UGC Contest.

The referral program is one of the top features of the $KOPS ICO, making it easy for people to earn rewards by referring family or friends. Anyone investing just $25 in $KOPS will receive their reference code that can be used to invite friends. Anyone who joins the ICO using your code will earn rewards and privileges. As a result, investors can increase their share by encouraging new participants in the $KOPS ICO. It allows investors to get more value from their investments with no additional cost.

Besides the referral bonuses, buying $KOPS during the ICO gives you a 100% bonus. By doubling the amount of tokens bought, investors benefit immediately after purchasing. The bonus tokens will appear in the investor's wallet after the period and can be redeemed using the rewards page. The only criterion is to acquire a minimum of 1000 $KOPS. Thus, early buyers of $KOPS at the ICO will be able to reap the rewards from day one.

The platform runs a User-Generated Content (UGC) contest to help energize the $KOPS community. The Creator Fund contest consists of 85,000,000 $KOPS tokens that can be won by people who submit videos, memes, threads, and more. As there are big rewards for the best entries, both amateurs and professionals are motivated to take part and create work that could bring them token prizes.

For the UGC contest, the top prize is 20 million $KOPS, the second-place medalists get 10 million $KOPS, and third place gets 5 million $KOPS. Besides, 30 million $KOPS are distributed between 20 popular creators, the community selects 5 million, and 15 million is given for popular, humorous, or lesser-known content. Anyone can join, and suddenly sharing a successful meme could add much to an individual's $KOPS. Everyone can join in, earn new tokens, and participate in the $KOPS platform.

While each $KOPS can be bought for as low as $0.001 during the ICO, many think its value will rise significantly. If $KOPS rises to $0.4, $0.6, or even $0.8, people with a big holding will collect significant returns. For instance, 5 million tokens valued at $0.8 each can profit considerably. Since the growth potential is quite strong, early $KOPS investors might discover that the value of their coins increases quickly.

The development team has officially commenced the ICO of $KOPS. The $KOPS ICO is the best opportunity for those interested in cryptocurrency due to its awesome bonuses, top-class referral program, and impressive UGC contest. Those who buy early will benefit the most when the token's value rises later.

The $KOPS ICO provides a special way for individuals to start investing in cryptocurrency. By entering at just $0.001, enjoying many rewards and the UGC contest, joining $KOPS means becoming part of a lively community with many opportunities. Those who invest now can take advantage of the future potential of $KOPS.

Privacy concerns are no longer a side issue in crypto; they're central to user protection. As blockchain networks grow more open and surveillance tools become more advanced, the risks linked to data exposure through traditional wallets are becoming more apparent.
Cold Wallet brings a new direction by merging zero-knowledge technology with cold-storage methods. It enables users to maintain full control over their digital activity without sacrificing accessibility, offering a seamless experience designed around confidentiality.
   
Currently priced at $0.00773 during stage 6 of its presale, with a planned listing value of $0.3517, Cold Wallet is gaining serious attention. With growing interest in DeFi tools that protect user identity, analysts suggest it holds the potential to reach 100x returns post-launch.
Fixing the Hidden Privacy Flaws in Popular Wallets
There's a common assumption that managing one's own keys guarantees safety. But the reality is that many widely used wallets leak sensitive data. From revealing IP details to tracking user behavior via analytics, these tools can expose strategies and personal details that should remain private.       
Cold Wallet answers this with a system that mimics offline behavior even when connected. Its infrastructure leverages zero-knowledge proofs to hide user balances, blur transaction histories, and stop data leaks. It goes beyond traditional tools by ensuring both usability and advanced protection at all times.

This approach makes it stand out among privacy-driven crypto launches. Cold Wallet prioritizes stealth, secure interactions, and peace of mind, key traits that appeal to both individual users and institutional players.
Cold Wallet Presale, Utility Role, and Platform Vision
Cold Wallet is presenting a genuine working solution to the rising data privacy challenge. Its design supports real-world use with a structured system that powers essential features and user feedback-driven upgrades.
The $CWT unit fuels platform governance, enables privacy tools, and allows users to take part in the project's future development. Now available in stage 6 of its crypto presale at $0.00773, with a listing price planned at $0.3517, its positioning gives an advantage to early contributors who value practical applications.   

Participants gain input into major decisions, such as protocol upgrades and third-party integrations. With DeFi platforms leaning more toward secure design and private operations, Cold Wallet's model fits the need for foundational tech in the space.
Rather than serving as a placeholder, $CWT has been developed to perform key roles across the platform's operation. As adoption spreads, the expectation is that usage and demand will climb steadily.
Why Cold Wallet Stands Out in the Privacy Sector
Today's crypto audience is paying more attention to projects with practical use cases rather than marketing buzz. Cold Wallet's real appeal comes from its capacity to meet the needs of both everyday users and larger entities without giving up usability or protection.
The platform allows DeFi participants to operate with full privacy, avoiding exposure to competitors or external trackers. For high-volume traders, this means conducting activities without unwanted visibility.        

The development roadmap includes features like browser access, mobile apps, multi-chain connections, and business-level deployment. As regulatory pressures rise and user data protection becomes more critical, Cold Wallet's offering becomes even more timely and necessary.
If usage scales as predicted, the current sub-1-cent price could grow toward $0.71, matching the 100x forecast. With its focus on privacy and real-world problem-solving, Cold Wallet positions itself as a rare example of utility-focused progress in digital finance.
Final Thoughts!
Cold Wallet is focused on solving a critical issue, not chasing quick volume. Through zero-knowledge architecture, tracker-free design, and a user-first system, it reinforces core Web3 values: ownership and privacy.
At the $0.00773 presale price and a listing goal of $0.3517, the potential for gain is substantial. More importantly, its foundation in tech and usability supports long-term relevance. For those seeking a Web3 tool with real purpose and clear direction, Cold Wallet offers one of the strongest use cases currently on the rise.

This approach makes it stand out among privacy-driven crypto launches. Cold Wallet prioritizes stealth, secure interactions, and peace of mind, key traits that appeal to both individual users and institutional players.
Cold Wallet Presale, Utility Role, and Platform Vision
Cold Wallet is presenting a genuine working solution to the rising data privacy challenge. Its design supports real-world use with a structured system that powers essential features and user feedback-driven upgrades.
The $CWT unit fuels platform governance, enables privacy tools, and allows users to take part in the project's future development. Now available in stage 6 of its crypto presale at $0.00773, with a listing price planned at $0.3517, its positioning gives an advantage to early contributors who value practical applications.   

Participants gain input into major decisions, such as protocol upgrades and third-party integrations. With DeFi platforms leaning more toward secure design and private operations, Cold Wallet's model fits the need for foundational tech in the space.
Rather than serving as a placeholder, $CWT has been developed to perform key roles across the platform's operation. As adoption spreads, the expectation is that usage and demand will climb steadily.
Why Cold Wallet Stands Out in the Privacy Sector
Today's crypto audience is paying more attention to projects with practical use cases rather than marketing buzz. Cold Wallet's real appeal comes from its capacity to meet the needs of both everyday users and larger entities without giving up usability or protection.
The platform allows DeFi participants to operate with full privacy, avoiding exposure to competitors or external trackers. For high-volume traders, this means conducting activities without unwanted visibility.        

The development roadmap includes features like browser access, mobile apps, multi-chain connections, and business-level deployment. As regulatory pressures rise and user data protection becomes more critical, Cold Wallet's offering becomes even more timely and necessary.
If usage scales as predicted, the current sub-1-cent price could grow toward $0.71, matching the 100x forecast. With its focus on privacy and real-world problem-solving, Cold Wallet positions itself as a rare example of utility-focused progress in digital finance.
Final Thoughts!
Cold Wallet is focused on solving a critical issue, not chasing quick volume. Through zero-knowledge architecture, tracker-free design, and a user-first system, it reinforces core Web3 values: ownership and privacy.
At the $0.00773 presale price and a listing goal of $0.3517, the potential for gain is substantial. More importantly, its foundation in tech and usability supports long-term relevance. For those seeking a Web3 tool with real purpose and clear direction, Cold Wallet offers one of the strongest use cases currently on the rise.

President Donald Trump's ‘big, beautiful' bill is set to become law, a move that some argue will increase U.S. deficits and debt while likely boosting Bitcoin and altcoin prices in the long term.

The bill extends the 2017 tax cuts Trump signed into law. It also introduces new tax measures he campaigned on, including a $1,000 tax credit for all children born in the country and exemptions for tips. It will also raise the estate tax exemption to $15 million.

The “big, beautiful” bill will likely be bullish for Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins for several reasons. 

First, the bill is expected to increase the U.S. public debt and deficit. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates it will raise public debt by $3.3 trillion over the next ten years. It will also push the debt-to-GDP ratio from 100% to 125%, compared to 117% under current law.

The surging debt comes as the U.S. has lost its last triple-A credit rating from Moody's. S&P Global and Fitch Ratings downgraded the country's rating in 2011 and 2023, respectively.

Rising risks of a U.S. government default are considered bullish for Bitcoin, which is increasingly viewed as a safe-haven asset. Many Bitcoin analysts, including BlackRock's Larry Fink, believe that it is digital gold.

In a recent white paper, BlackRock noted that Bitcoin was a unique diversifier and that many investors are buying it to hedge against growing U.S. debt.

Analysts cite Bitcoin's tokenomics, a capped supply of 21 million coins and a halving mechanism that slows its issuance by cutting block rewards every four years.Bitcoin's falling supply is occurring just as institutional and government demand is rising.

Second, the “big, beautiful bill” could also boost Bitcoin by introducing new tax breaks, increasing the disposable income of many Americans.

More disposable income could lead some people to buy Bitcoin and other altcoins. A notable example occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic when Americans used stimulus checks to purchase Bitcoin.

Additionally, the bill will likely expand the M2 money supply in the U.S. as the Federal Reserve may be forced to print money to fund the growing deficit. Historically, Bitcoin has tracked the M2 money supply, albeit with a lag. Most altcoins then tend to follow Bitcoin's price movements.

Finally, the bill's tax cuts and deregulation measures could help to offset the impact of Donald Trump's tariffs and help to reduce recession risks. Falling recession risks would then be bullish for Bitcoin and other altcoins.

A new report from Standard Chartered says sovereign entities are increasingly gaining Bitcoin exposure through shares of Strategy (MSTR), supporting the bank's $500,000 BTC target by 2029.

Sovereign investment in Bitcoin is accelerating—just not always in the most direct way. In a new report, Standard Chartered Bank says indirect exposure via Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is quietly increasing among government entities, reinforcing the bank's long-standing price prediction that Bitcoin will reach $500,000 before President Donald Trump leaves office in 2029.

“The latest 13F data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) supports our core thesis that Bitcoin (BTC) will reach the $500,000 level before Trump leaves office as it attracts a wider range of institutional buyers,” wrote Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered's global head of digital assets research. “As more investors gain access to the asset and as volatility falls, we believe portfolios will migrate towards their optimal level from an underweight starting position in BTC.”

Q1 13F filings revealed a slowdown in direct bitcoin ETF buying—Wisconsin's state fund exited its entire 3,400 BTC-equivalent IBIT position—while government-linked purchases of MSTR shares were on the rise. Abu Dhabi's Mubadala, for instance, upped its IBIT exposure to 5,000 BTC equivalent, but Kendrick says the bigger story is elsewhere.

“We believe that in some cases, MSTR holdings by government entities reflect a desire to gain Bitcoin exposure where local regulations do not allow direct BTC holdings,” he said.

France and Saudi Arabia took first-time MSTR positions in Q1. Meanwhile, Norway's Government Pension Fund, the Swiss National Bank, and South Korea's public funds each added exposure equivalent to 700 BTC. U.S. retirement funds in states like California and New York added a combined 1,000 BTC equivalent via MSTR. Kendrick called the trend “very encouraging.”

“The quarterly 13F data is the best test of our thesis that BTC will attract new institutional buyer types as the market matures, helping the price reach our USD 500,000 level,” Kendrick said. “When institutions buy Bitcoin, prices tend to rise.”

SEC DATA BACKS BITCOIN $500K TARGET BY 2028: STANDARD CHARTEREDStandard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick says recent SEC 13F filings support a possible rise in Bitcoin to $500,000 by end-2028. While direct ETF holdings dipped in Q1, government entities boosted stakes in Strategy…

This isn't Kendrick's first bullish call. Last month, he admitted his prior $120K forecast for Q2 2025 was “too low,” citing surging inflows into U.S. spot BTC ETFs—totaling $5.3 billion over just three weeks. At the time, Kendrick revised his 2025 year-end target to $200,000.

Standard Chartered's latest analysis shows that Bitcoin's role in institutional portfolios is maturing beyond tech volatility correlation—now increasingly seen as a macro hedge. “It is now all about flows,” Kendrick said. “And flows are coming in many forms.”

Bitcoin and Ethereum investment products have seen significant inflows, with digital asset funds recording $785 million last week, marking the fifth consecutive week of positive inflows. Bitcoin attracted $557 million, while Ethereum saw $205 million, boosted by the Pectra upgrade and leadership changes. The year-to-date inflows for digital assets have now reached $7.5 billion, surpassing the previous peak set in early February.



Institutional interest in Bitcoin has surged, with Northeast Financial revealing a $7.2 million purchase, and Millennium Management increasing its holdings to $1.6 billion. Bank of America also disclosed an increase in its Bitcoin exposure in its Q1 13F filing. BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has been a dominant player, pulling in $305.9 million on a single day, with total net assets reaching $66.9 billion, representing about 3.2% of Bitcoin's market capitalization. Fidelity also made a significant move, purchasing $188 million worth of Bitcoin.



Ethereum has been highlighted as a standout performer, with Abraxas Capital accumulating 350,703 ETH worth $837 million since May 7, including a recent $115.3 million purchase. BlackRock also bought $13.1 million worth of Ethereum. The Realized Cap of Ethereum has surged by $3.8 billion since the Pectra upgrade, reversing a three-month downtrend.



Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen their assets under management reach $131.08 billion, with BlackRock's ETF holding 631,962 BTC valued at approximately $65 billion, representing nearly 3% of the total Bitcoin supply. The ETFs recorded $667.4 million in inflows on a single day, with Bitcoin trading above $100,000 for 12 consecutive days and reaching its highest weekly close in history. BlackRock's spot ETFs also purchased 2,870 BTC and 5,490 ETH on May 19, totaling roughly $318 million.

Bitcoin Foundation Chairman Brock Pierce joins ‘Varney & Co.' to discuss Trump's ‘crypto strategic reserve' plan. 

Threats against high-profile names in the cryptocurrency world are rising as the value of industry holdings continues to grow.

Geno Roefaro, CEO of Florida-based SaferWatch, a security platform designed to enhance emergency response across public and private institutions, has observed a growing trend: organized crime groups are increasingly targeting individuals' cryptocurrency holdings using "sophisticated methods."

Jethro Pijlman, managing director of Netherlands-based Infinite Risks International, a firm that provides physical security and intelligence services to cryptocurrency holders, told FOX Business that threats against crypto executives have noticeably increased globally since 2021.

Last week, a group of men tried to attack the daughter of French crypto firm Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat on the street in Paris in broad daylight. Earlier this year, the founder of French crypto company Ledger and his wife were kidnapped. In a separate incident, the father of the head of another crypto company was also kidnapped, according to Reuters. While all of them were rescued, it provoked a sense of fear and urgency among other high-net-worth individuals in the sector. 

Additionally, there has been a "particularly high concentration in Asia," Pijlman said.

Coinbase revealed in a recent regulatory filing that it spent $6.2 million last year on personal security for CEO Brian Armstrong.

"This trend aligns with the cyclical nature of the crypto markets. Each cycle typically includes a euphoric phase marked by the rapid accumulation of wealth," Pijlman said, noting that "it is common for individuals to publicly display their newfound prosperity through luxury vehicles, high-end real estate, expensive watches, and other status symbols, often showcased on YouTube, Instagram, and other social media platforms."

Last fall, for instance, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun purchased Maurizio Cattelan's famed banana duct-taped to a wall artwork for $6.2 million. Not only was the purchase itself noteworthy, but Sun, who founded the Tron blockchain in 2017, was then filmed eating the viral fruit during a news conference in Hong Kong. To commemorate the moment, he also posted a tongue-in-cheek comment on X about the taste of the viral fruit. 

"Unfortunately, this public exposure often occurs without adequate awareness of personal security risks," Pijlman said, adding that "many individuals unintentionally share sensitive information online." This includes travel itineraries, attendance at industry events or meetups, photos of luxury vehicles with visible license plates, identifiable backgrounds and real-time videos from upscale restaurants, clubs or private gatherings. Even posts or tags by friends can unintentionally reveal their location, according to Pijlman. 

"This kind of content provides a treasure trove of intelligence for criminal organizations. It is not uncommon for such groups to monitor a target's digital footprint for weeks or even months before executing a robbery or abduction. The level of detail available through open-source intelligence is often staggering," he added. 

COINBASE SUES SEC, FDIC FOR INFORMATION RELATING TO CRYPTO REGULATION

Pijlman said his firm applies the same techniques used to locate individuals in threat assessments to proactively protect its clients. This includes real-time alerts when oversharing occurs and helping clients adjust their online behavior to reduce exposure. The firm's transportation services are delivered exclusively by security-trained drivers. In most major cities throughout Europe and the United States, the firm deploys executive protection agents, often with government or military backgrounds, who specialize in minimizing personal risk during client movements. It also offers residential security solutions, including armed protection. 

Roefaro told FOX Business that the rapid rise in cryptocurrency wealth has added a new layer of complexity to executive protection.

"As digital fortunes grow, so does the risk of targeted attacks. The hiring of personal security by crypto high-rollers is not merely a trend but a strategic necessity," Roefaro said. "It's a clear indication that personal security must evolve in tandem with financial innovation."

Roefaro's company, which created a discrete device to help executives, other employees and their families get help without drawing any attention, also has a client in the cryptocurrency space.

These are the most attractive type of high-value targets for organized crime, according to Roefaro, as the asset they are stealing is already in the form of digital currency. It is also hard for victims to recover from the losses because they transfer them internationally, Roefaro said. 

Sean Worthington, founder of CloudCoin, one of the first cloud-based digital currencies developed outside of blockchain, said that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin carry inherent risks of theft and loss due to their reliance on a single critical component known as the private key. 

"This ‘golden egg' represents a fundamental vulnerability, as there are no built-in safeguards to mitigate the risk it poses. Insiders – such as system administrators or software developers at cryptocurrency firms – can potentially siphon funds undetected, leaving businesses exposed to significant financial losses with little recourse or accountability," he said.

Leading coin Bitcoin briefly soared above the $107,000 mark yesterday. It reached an intraday peak of $107,108, just 2% shy of its all-time high of $109,588, before retracing. 

Although the leading cryptocurrency has since retreated slightly to $104,976 at press time, market sentiment remains firmly bullish, with on-chain indicators suggesting continued upward momentum.

According to data from Blockchain Center, the cryptocurrency market remains deep in “Bitcoin Season,” a period when BTC significantly outperforms the broader altcoin market.

As of this writing, only 16 (32%) of the top 50 altcoins have outperformed BTC over the past 90 days, far below the 75% threshold required to qualify as “Altcoin Season.”

Furthermore, Bitcoin's rising dominance supports this position. Since plunging to a two-month low of 61.89% on May 16, BTC.D, a metric that tracks BTC's share of total crypto market capitalization, has climbed steadily.

As of this writing, the metric stands at 63.92%.

Interestingly, since May 14, TOTAL2, which measures the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding BTC, has trended downward. Currently standing at $1.18 trillion, it has plunged $83 billion over the past week. 

This divergence suggests market participants are increasingly reallocating capital into BTC over altcoins.

The current trend signals that traders are doubling down on BTC's resilience, especially as the king coin attempts to stabilize above the key $105,000 price mark.

On the daily chart, BTC's Directional Movement Index (DMI) confirms the bullish pressure in the market. As of this writing, the coin's positive directional index (+DI, blue) rests above its negative directional index (-DI, orange).

When an asset's DMI is set up this way, it indicates that bullish momentum is stronger than bearish momentum. This signals a prevailing uptrend and buying pressure in the BTC market.

If this continues, its price could attempt to breach the resistance at $107,048, and rally toward its all-time high of $109,588.

On the other hand, if sell-offs strengthen, BTC's price could dip to $102,080.

 The German government sold its Bitcoin stash in the summer of 2024, which became a $2.3 billion missed opportunity for Europe's largest economy. 

The German government missed out on more than $2 billion worth of Bitcoin profit after selling its holdings in 2024, according to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham.

A “German Government (BKA)” labeled cryptocurrency wallet sold 49,858 Bitcoin (BTC) worth over $2.89 billion at an average price of $57,900 across multiple transactions during June and July in 2024.

The decision to sell the Bitcoin early cost the German government over $2.35 billion, according to crypto intelligence platform Arkham.

“If they had held it, their BTC would now be worth $5.24B,” Arkham said in a May 19 X post, noting that Bitcoin has risen more than 80% since the sale.

At the time of publication, Bitcoin was trading at more than $104,700, according to CoinMarketCap data.

The German government-labeled wallet first raised speculation of a potential sell-off on June 19, 2024, when it executed a 6,500 BTC transfer worth over $425 million.

The wallet originally held around 50,000 BTC, believed to have been seized from the operators of Movie2k, a now-defunct pirated film site.

The wallet's selling patterns point to hasty transactions that weren't optimized for the smallest market impact and best profitability, according to Miguel Morel, founder of Arkham Intelligence.

“The last thing I would have expected is that they would just go to five different exchanges and start market selling,” Morel told Cointelegraph during an interview at EthCC 2024, adding:

The reports surrounding the German government's Bitcoin liquidations may have contributed more to Bitcoin's downtrend than the volume of sold Bitcoin.

Bitcoin's price recovered above the $60,000 psychological mark on July 14, a day after the German government-labeled wallet ran out of BTC, putting an end to investor uncertainty about further selling pressure.

KULR Technology Group, Inc.


HOUSTON, May  20, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KULR Technology Group, Inc. (NYSE American: KULR) (the "Company" or "KULR"), a global leader in sustainable energy management, today announced it has increased its bitcoin acquisitions for its Bitcoin Treasury by an additional $9 million to reach a total of $78 million in bitcoin acquisitions. The additional bitcoin were acquired at a weighted average price of $103,234 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. The Company now holds 800.3 BTC.

This strategic move aligns with KULR's Bitcoin Treasury Strategy announced on December 4, 2024, wherein the Company committed up to 90% of its surplus cash reserves to be held in bitcoin.

BTC Yield as a Key Performance Indicator

Year to date, KULR has achieved a BTC Yield of 220.2%, leveraging a combination of surplus cash and its At-The-Market (ATM) equity program to fund acquisitions.

KULR uses "BTC Yield" as a key performance indicator (KPI) for its Bitcoin Treasury strategy. BTC Yield is calculated as the percentage change period-to-period in the ratio of the Company's bitcoin holdings to its Assumed Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding. This KPI helps assess the effectiveness of KULR's bitcoin acquisition strategy in a manner KULR believes drives shareholder value.

Important Considerations Regarding BTC Yield

BTC Yield is intended to provide insights into KULR's bitcoin acquisition strategy but should not be interpreted as a measure of operating performance, financial return, or liquidity. It is not equivalent to traditional yield metrics, nor does it account for the Company's liabilities or broader financial position.

The trading price of KULR's common stock is influenced by multiple factors beyond bitcoin holdings, and BTC Yield does not predict or reflect the stock's market value. Investors should consider this metric as a supplementary tool and refer to the Company's financial statements and SEC filings for additional information about the Company's financial position.

KULR remains committed to its strategic goals of advancing shareholder value while adhering to disciplined financial management.

Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this report owns shares of Strategy (MSTR).

Strategy's (MSTR) perpetual preferred stock, STRK, achieved the largest proceeds from its weekly at-the-market (ATM) issuance since the program started in February, according to X account DogCandles, raising $59.7 million that was used to buy more bitcoin BTC$106,120.31, according to a Monday SEC filing. 

That amount corresponds to the issuance of approximately 621,555 STRK shares. Strategy has about $20.79 billion still available in the STRK ATM facility.

The company led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor is plowing ahead with its bitcoin-buying strategy even as the price of the largest cryptocurrency holds above $100,000, with an eye on its January record of $109,000. Strategy's Monday BTC purchase took its total holdings to 576,230 BTC.

This represents a 16.3% BTC yield, a key performance indicator (KPI) that reflects the year-to-date percentage increase in the ratio of MSTR's bitcoin holdings to its assumed diluted shares outstanding, effectively measuring the growth in BTC exposure on a per-share basis.

The recent STRK issuance represents just under 9% of the total proceeds generated from the ATM program for the common stock, which has raised $705.7 million to date. This highlights the increasing role STRK is playing in Strategy's  bitcoin acquisition model.

STRK features a fixed 8% annual dividend, which is based on the $100 per share liquidation preference, resulting in an annual payout of $8.00 per share. 

That gives it an effective yield, annual dividend divided by STRK share price, of 8.1%. Importantly, this yield is inversely related to the share price. As STRK trades higher, the yield decreases, and vice versa.

Since its launch on Feb. 10, STRK has risen by 16%, outperforming both bitcoin, which has added 10%, and the S&P 500, which has declined by 2% over the same period. 

According to data from the Strategy dashboard, STRK exhibits the lowest correlation with MSTR common stock, sitting at just 44%. In contrast, STRK maintains relatively higher correlations with broader market benchmarks: 71% with bitcoin and 72% with the SPY exchange-traded fund.

This suggests that STRK trades with a unique profile, potentially appealing to investors seeking differentiated exposure due to its hybrid nature as a preferred equity instrument with bitcoin-tied capital deployment.

Crypto World News

May 20, 2025 by Vaigha Varghese 

The search for the best altcoins to buy is heating up as investors prepare for the next breakout phase in crypto. While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, attention is shifting toward emerging tokens that combine real-world applications with strong community interest. These altcoins are gaining momentum across trading platforms, forums, and early-stage presales.

Many of the most talked-about projects today are not just about hype. They're blending technologies like artificial intelligence, smart contracts, and utility-driven use cases that go beyond speculation. Investors are watching closely to see which tokens have the right mix of innovation, traction, and timing to grow in 2025.

One presale making waves is Dawgz AI, a meme-inspired Ethereum token designed around AI-powered tools and community interactions. As presales continue to attract early movers, coins like this are starting to capture attention for more than just their theme.

Altcoins are cryptocurrencies that operate outside of Bitcoin. Some support smart contracts while others focus on DeFi, storage, or AI-based tools. As markets look beyond BTC's long-standing dominance, altcoins are drawing interest from investors who want exposure to more functional crypto ecosystems. These tokens now represent a growing share of volume across major platforms like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, with many showing sharp price swings ahead of market cycles.

One of the main reasons altcoins are being watched in 2025 is their potential to move faster than BTC. Many of them carry smaller market caps, which means even modest demand can spark noticeable gains. Altcoins that offer strong use cases, active development, and early-stage access through presales are being tracked closely by investors. Interest in Solana and Ethereum continues to rise because of their speed and utility, but analysts believe smaller tokens may show the top breakout potential.

The growth in altcoin interest is also tied to how these coins function. Some tokens power blockchains while others support decentralized apps or transaction models. The market is shifting toward altcoins that give real value through community interaction, AI features, or staking functions. Forbes shows that the global crypto market is expected to reach over 1.7 billion users by 2030. Many investors believe now is the time to look past Bitcoin and find tokens that offer more than storage of value.

Meme coins often draw attention for their viral appeal, but many fade due to weak fundamentals. A shift is happening in 2025 as investors begin to watch meme-based tokens that also provide real use cases. Some of these projects are combining community energy with tech-driven features that go beyond memes alone. This new direction has opened the door for a select group of tokens gaining traction not just for their theme but also for what they aim to do.

One of the more talked-about presales in this category is Dawgz AI, a token built on the Ethereum blockchain that introduces artificial intelligence into the meme coin model. Unlike many meme projects, it avoids NFTs and instead focuses on building AI-powered tools that support user interaction and growth. Dawgz AI recently passed a full audit by SolidProof, which improves transparency for early investors. The presale is currently active, with over $3.6 million raised and the price set at $0.00438 per token.

Crypto enthusiasts have started watching Dawgz AI not only because of its theme but also because of its structured roadmap. The token aims to introduce real features like AI meme generation and automated sentiment tools that reflect market trends. These use cases, combined with a strong presale performance, are pushing Dawgz AI into discussions about altcoins to buy in 2025. With increasing focus on AI-backed functionality in Web3, tokens like this may represent a shift toward community-first projects with more than just short-term hype.

Bitcoin remains a critical part of the market despite increasing focus on smaller altcoins. It holds the highest liquidity, the broadest adoption, and institutional backing that smaller tokens cannot match yet. Many investors view it as a stabilizer that has value when other assets dip.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $105364.94 with a market cap of over $2.09 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Its role has expanded since the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S., leading to a broader inflow of traditional capital. These developments make it a key component of most long-term portfolios, even for investors who also explore newer tokens.

Analysts from platforms like Forbes Digital Assets believe Bitcoin could still benefit from macroeconomic shifts in 2025. Although it may not offer the same percentage growth as smaller altcoins, its market strength and regulatory progress give it a strategic edge. For those building a diverse portfolio, BTC remains a top-tier option alongside more speculative plays.

Solana is one of the most discussed blockchains due to its fast transactions and low costs. Its focus on scalability has attracted developers, especially in DeFi and gaming, where fast performance is critical. The network continues to grow with more integrations and partnerships entering its ecosystem.

Solana is currently priced at $167.05, with a market cap of around $86.86 billion as reported by Binance. It has shown resilience after network outages in previous years, gaining back trust through upgrades and sustained uptime. The DefiLlama platform shows that Solana's total value locked (TVL) is increasing, pointing to deeper utility and long-term developer confidence.

Crypto enthusiasts view Solana as a strong bet in the altcoin market, especially as more Layer 1 platforms face congestion. While it may not carry the same meme appeal as newer presales, its real-world traction and developer interest make it one of the altcoins to buy when considering long-term utility in 2025.

Arbitrum brings Layer 2 scaling to Ethereum by allowing faster and cheaper transactions through rollup technology. It gives developers the flexibility of Ethereum's ecosystem without the gas fees that limit usability. As the demand for scalable smart contracts rises, Arbitrum is positioned to support a new wave of dApps.

ARB is trading at $0.3873, with a market cap of approximately $1.88 billion, based on Binance data. Its TVL continues to grow, surpassing $2.6 billion according to DefiLlama, which signals strong adoption. The Arbitrum Foundation is also working on grants and incentives to attract more developers to the platform.

Analysts expect Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum to be critical to Ethereum's scalability. Unlike Layer 1 competitors, Arbitrum does not compete with Ethereum but helps support its growth. That position gives ARB a unique value in the 2025 crypto cycle and places it among the top altcoin options for those seeking real network impact.

Presales have become a common entry point for investors who want to secure a position before a token hits public exchanges. Unlike launched projects, presales often offer lower prices, early access bonuses, and closer engagement with the team. This model allows investors to track early momentum, tokenomics, and marketing strategies before making larger commitments.

Recent data shows that investors have poured over $1 billion into presale crypto projects since late 2023, according to Cointelegraph. Dawgz AI stands out in this space by combining AI-based functionality with meme coin branding, a pairing that reflects where demand is heading. So far, Dawgz AI has raised over $3.6 million, with early investors noting its smart contract audit and utility roadmap as key reasons for interest.

Presales like Dawgz AI appeal to those who follow community growth and emerging trends. Many traders are looking for altcoins that serve a function or create tools that add value in real time. The best projects in this category often balance creativity with utility, and Dawgz AI is doing that through AI integration, a defined roadmap, and clear tokenomics. This shift suggests that presales in 2025 may not just be about hype, but about early access to tools built with purpose. For detailed information, please watch the following video:

Not all altcoins have staying power. Investors who plan to hold for the next few years are paying closer attention to how a project works rather than how fast its price moves. They're watching token utility, developer activity, community strength, and the ability to stay relevant as the market shifts.

According to Binance Research, many of the tokens that outperformed in the past cycle had something in common: clear purpose, transparent tokenomics, and consistent development. The same principles are guiding investor decisions now. As 2025 approaches, the altcoins with growing traction are those offering real-world tools, smart contract upgrades, and functional utility in Web3 or DeFi. Crypto enthusiasts are also paying attention to the teams behind these tokens and whether they've shared measurable milestones.

Traders looking for the best altcoins to buy now are not just chasing trends. They're studying presales like Dawgz AI that combine early-stage entry with long-term vision. They're also diversifying with large-cap tokens like Bitcoin and Solana, which continue to show market influence. In a sector known for volatility, tokens backed by utility and a clear purpose tend to attract those thinking long instead of short.

Presales are no longer just for early hype. In 2025, they are becoming a starting point for tokens built on actual use cases, not just clever branding. Investors are looking closely at utility, team transparency, and how early access gives them a better entry point before a token hits public markets.

Dawgz AI reflects this shift. It offers a mix of meme appeal and AI-driven tools while staying grounded in a clear roadmap and Ethereum-backed infrastructure. Its strong presale momentum, audit verification, and growing community are signals that traders are becoming more selective about where they place early bets.

If you're researching altcoins with potential beyond the surface, it may be worth taking a closer look at Dawgz AI. Visit the official Dawgz AI presale page to explore its features, roadmap, and pricing before the next phase fills.

The best altcoins in 2025 are those combining strong utility, growing communities, and developer activity. Projects like Dawgz AI, which offer real features and transparent roadmaps, are gaining early traction among long-term investors.

Yes, meme coins remain active in the market, especially when paired with real functionality. Dawgz AI is one example that blends meme culture with AI-powered tools to attract both traders and community supporters.

Analysts often consider token utility, market cap, trading volume, and development milestones when assessing altcoin growth. Tokens like Dawgz AI, which offer both functional use and active presale interest, fit the current trend investors are tracking.

A worthwhile presale typically includes verified audits, clear tokenomics, and a roadmap that outlines real features. Dawgz AI meets many of these criteria and has already raised over $3.6 million during its early phase.

Genesis Global Capital, a cryptocurrency lender, has filed lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and DCG CEO Barry Silbert. The lawsuits, filed in two courts, seek to recover over $3.1 billion related to note and asset transfers. Genesis alleges insider self-dealing, fraud, and mismanagement by Silbert, accusing him of improper transfers exceeding $1 billion while the company was insolvent. These legal actions come amid broader accusations that Silbert misrepresented the financial status of his companies, contributing to the collapse of the 2022 cryptocurrency market. The litigation reflects ongoing tensions within the crypto industry and highlights disputes over financial transparency and corporate governance at DCG and its subsidiaries.

SINGAPORE, May 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As mid-May unfolds, crypto market sentiment continues to rise. While major assets trend steadily upward, capital is beginning to rotate into fundamentally solid altcoins. In this edition of HTX DeepThink, Chloe (@ChloeTalk1) from HTX Research shares her macro outlook and strategic insights, with a spotlight on rotation opportunities across the SUI ecosystem and the emerging AttentionFi sector.

Macro Outlook: Rising Bullish Sentiment Amidst Steady Short-Term Uptrend

This week's U.S. economic calendar is light on major data releases. Market attention is primarily directed towards Federal Reserve officials' interpretations of recent commentary suggesting a possible single interest rate cut in 2025.

Analysis of options market data shows a prevailing bullish sentiment: the Call/Put open interest ratio has reached 1.55, accompanied by increasing premiums for call options. At the same time, short-term implied volatility (IV) has dropped to a new 18-month low of 35–40%.

In short: the market is experiencing "euphoric sentiment amid calm volatility." Under such conditions, Bitcoin could retest new highs within the next 30–45 days, targeting the $105K–$115K range. However, this mix of high sentiment and low volatility often conceals the build-up of excessive leverage. A sudden surge in IV or a meaningful drop below $100K could trigger a sharp deleveraging event.

Strategic Positioning: Capital Rotation into High-Quality Altcoins for Momentum Capture

From a capital allocation perspective, rotating a portion of capital into fundamentally strong and liquid altcoins may present an opportunity to capitalize on potential spillover momentum from Bitcoin's upward trajectory. This edition of HTX DeepThink highlights promising sectors and projects worthy of investor attention.

SUI Ecosystem: All-Time High Market Cap, Undervalued Core Project

The SUI chain has reached an all-time high in market cap, but its ecosystem projects have yet to follow with substantial gains. This opens a window for early positioning in undervalued ecosystem leaders. HTX has listed two standout projects within the SUI ecosystem: Haedal and Bluefin.

Given the rising attention on SUI's mainnet, Haedal and Bluefin appear to exhibit dual potential for valuation recovery and Beta-driven upside, which may warrant mid-term attention from market participants.

AttentionFi: Capitalizing on Bull Market User Acquisition Premium

New Web3 projects are launching rapidly, and the cost of user acquisition is soaring. In traditional channels like Telegram, Google, or Red Note, user acquisition cost (UAC) is calculated via "traffic × conversion rate." With CPCs at $0.5–1.0 and conversion rates around 10%, it can cost $5–10 to acquire a real, retained user.

Kaito offers a far more efficient "attention engine." Its API charges based on a combination of reputation score and meaningful engagement. As a result, project teams can acquire real users with 3–4x higher retention at just $2–3 per user—much lower than traditional channels. With this model, Kaito has grown rapidly, expanding from 30 to 120 integrated projects in the past three months, and quadrupling API call volume.

Meanwhile, $KAITO staking has surged to 19.7M tokens, and the protocol has cumulatively bought back and burned 3.7M tokens, creating a strong demand-supply mismatch and deflationary pressure that supports higher price ceilings.

On Base chain's IDO platform Virtuals, users who stake ≥5,000 $KAITO can earn Virgen Points to redeem IDO allocations. Several recent IDOs have seen 10–30x returns on day one, forming a lucrative loop: stake → points → arbitrage.

With the recent listing of $KAITO on HTX, its liquidity is expanding—and in a bull market where competition for user attention intensifies, Kaito's combination of low-cost, high-precision targeting and deflationary tokenomics makes it a promising asset to watch.

XRP and Ethereum had been in a battle for the second spot for years until the former entered a bearish phase following the SEC's lawsuit.

With Bitcoin (BTC) securing its spot as the largest crypto asset by market cap, Ethereum (ETH) has also maintained the second spot for years. However, this dominance for first and second positions was not always the case.

Notably, while BTC has always remained the largest asset, the position of the second-largest cryptocurrency was once a constant battle between XRP and Ethereum, with both assets occasionally retaking and relinquishing this position for years. 

For context, before the launch of XRP and Ethereum, Litecoin secured the second spot among the largest crypto assets until October 2014, when XRP surpassed it to hold this position.

XRP maintained this spot, with Litecoin unable to catch up, until Ethereum outranked it in February 2016. CoinMarketCap's historical snapshot confirms that Ethereum soared to a market cap of $358.3 million in late February 2016, while XRP had a valuation of $276 million. 

Throughout 2016, Ethereum held the second spot, eventually closing the year with a valuation of over $600 million, over $400 million higher than XRP's $200 million valuation. 

However, things changed in December 2017 on the back of XRP's meteoric run. By December 31, 2017, XRP boasted a market cap of $89.12 billion, holding the second spot, while Ethereum, which had a market cap of $73.17 billion, was relegated to third.

Nonetheless, as XRP witnessed a massive correction, Ethereum retook the second spot. In 2018 alone, the two assets continuously reclaimed and lost this position, with XRP closing the year as the victor with a valuation of $15.07 billion, dwarfing Ethereum's $14.56 billion.

This battle slipped into 2019 and 2020, but Ethereum mostly maintained the second spot. However, following the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, XRP collapsed further, even relegating the third spot and slipping to as low as seventh in February 2021. 

In recent years, specifically in 2023 and 2024, XRP also struggled to even make it to the top 5. Even in October 2024, XRP languished in the seventh spot, with a market cap of $29.3 billion, ten times less than Ethereum's market cap of $301.7 billion at the time.

XRP's breakthrough materialized in November 2024 following the U.S. elections. By Dec. 8, 2024, the asset had recovered the third spot with a market cap of $148.98 billion. However, this was still $334 billion below Ethereum's market cap of $482 billion.

Interestingly, due to its greater resilience amid the market-wide bearish pressure that began in February 2025, XRP is now closer to overtaking Ethereum than it has been in years. Currently, XRP's market cap of $138 billion is $169 billion away from Ethereum's valuation of $307 billion.

For context, XRP only needs to rally to a price of $5.24 to overtake Ethereum in market cap. This would require a 122% increase from the current price of $2.36. With the SEC lawsuit now heading toward a definitive settlement, most believe XRP could eventually retake the second spot if it maintains its growth momentum.

WASHINGTON — The Senate advanced a major cryptocurrency regulation bill Monday on a bipartisan vote two weeks after every Senate Democrat united to block it. 

The procedural vote on the GENIUS Act — which would establish the first regulatory framework for issuers of stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar — was 66-32. Sixteen Democrats voted with the majority of Senate Republicans to advance the bill. Two Republicans, Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Jerry Moran of Kansas, voted against it. 

The bill needed to cross the 60-vote threshold to advance to final passage in the Senate, where Republicans hold a three-seat majority.

Democratic support to proceed with the legislation was unlocked after a group of bipartisan negotiators — Sens. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn; Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo.; Mark Warner, D-Va.; Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.; Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md.; and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz. — reached an agreement late last week on an amendment to the bill that addressed key sticking points for Democrats. 

The amendment, which Democratic negotiators circulated over the weekend and has been obtained by NBC News, includes new changes to consumer protection safeguards and limits on tech companies issuing stablecoins, and it would extend ethics standards to special government employees — which would temporarily apply to Elon Musk and tech entrepreneur David Sacks. 

In exchange for the negotiated changes, Democrats involved in discussions said they have committed to support advancing the GENIUS Act, according to multiple sources familiar with the talks. 

Senate Republicans have been noncommittal about backing the amendment, but the updated changes are likely to get more Democrats on board beyond the core group involved in negotiations.

The bill hit a roadblock two weeks ago when Democrats, along with two Republicans — Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri — blocked the bill from advancing, demanding stronger national security and anti-money laundering provisions. 

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., criticized his colleagues across the aisle for delaying the vote, pointing out that no changes have been made to the underlying bill that Democrats blocked two weeks ago. 

“It's really hard to understand why we needed to wait an additional 11 days for Democrats to finally agree to move,” Thune said Monday, adding that he expects the Senate won't vote on final passage before it leaves for the Memorial Day recess. 

The Trump family's crypto dealings with World Liberty Financial, and President Donald Trump's dinner for the top holders of his meme coin, have aggravated concerns among Democrats. (Meme coins are different from stable coins, as they typically derive value from internet culture rather than from an underlying utility or asset.) But no provisions in the negotiated amendment would prohibit Trump and his family from continuing their crypto ventures. 

The bill text includes a provision that would “prohibit any member of Congress or senior executive branch official from issuing a payment stablecoin product during their time in public service.”

Some Democrats have argued it needs to be stronger.

“Basic flaws remain unaddressed,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., the top Democrat on the Banking Committee, said on the Senate floor Monday. “Congress should not choose to enable the president's egregious corruption.”

Several Senate Democrats have also introduced bills targeting the Trump family's crypto ventures to prevent the president from potentially profiting off of the deals. 

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., for example, plans to offer legislation called the STABLE Act, which would prevent elected officials and federal candidates from issuing or endorsing digital assets, as an amendment to the GENIUS Act. 

Democrats are expected to force votes on those bills this week, but they are unlikely to go anywhere in the GOP-controlled chamber.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., convened a caucus-wide call Sunday night to discuss the GENIUS Act. Warren voiced her concerns about the bill during the call, according to a person with knowledge of her comments. 

While some Democrats like Warren said they can't vote for the bill without stronger provisions that limit Trump's profiting from digital assets, others, like Warner, argued that Congress can no longer sit on the sidelines of the evolving cryptocurrency space.

“Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family's use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” Warner, who voted to advance the GENIUS Act, wrote in a statement Monday. 

“But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay. If American lawmakers don't shape it, others will — and not in ways that serve our interests or democratic values,” he added.

If the Senate ultimately passes the GENIUS Act, its future is less clear in the House, where there is a different bill to regulate stablecoin issuers. Cryptocurrency advocates argue that Congress should also pass legislation to determine regulatory treatment of digital assets and digital asset securities.

“The winners, if Congress passes this bill, are Americans who want to make payments faster and easier to access,” said Kara Calvert, the vice president for public policy at Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange. “It's transformational technology, so passing this bill is a win for them. It's not just a win for the industry or a political candidate.”

Fibroblasts are specialised connective tissue cells that play a key role in wound healing and tissue regeneration. The recent scientific publication from the University of Leipzig Medical Center shows that fibroblasts respond differently depending on the organ and disease context. Their functions are shaped by their embryonic origin, tissue-specific signals, and pathological stimuli. These specialised cells are not only involved in tissue repair and remodelling, but also influence the immune system and the development of diseases such as cancer, fibrosis and chronic inflammatory conditions.

"Until now, our understanding of fibroblast diversity has been based primarily on studies in animal models. This new review is the first to compare and integrate extensive human studies that have used modern single-cell technologies. This approach makes it possible to combine findings from different human studies, creating a comprehensive picture of the various origins and functions of human fibroblasts," says Professor Sandra Franz, lead author of the study from the University of Leipzig Medical Center.

This deeper understanding of cellular heterogeneity opens up new avenues for the development of targeted therapies. In the future, it may be possible to specifically address certain fibroblast subtypes -- for example, to promote tissue repair or to inhibit pathological processes such as tumour growth. This is particularly significant for regenerative medicine and the treatment of chronic diseases.

The authors of the study -- Dr Marta Torregrossa, Professor Jan C. Simon, and Professor Sandra Franz (all from the University of Leipzig Medical Center), together with Dr Yuval Rinkevich (Helmholtz Munich) -- are conducting joint research as part of the ZellTWund project. Their aim is to further characterise regeneration-promoting fibroblast subtypes and their roles in health and disease -- thereby paving the way for new therapeutic approaches. Translating these findings into clinical applications remains a key challenge for the coming years, the Leipzig researchers conclude.

Food cravings are the downfall of many dieters, who feel locked in an eternal battle with their willpower to resist the tempting sweets, snacks and other foods they love.

However, researchers in food science and human nutrition at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign say in a new study that eating dessert may be the optimal strategy for losing weight, keeping it off and keeping cravings at bay. Dieters in a clinical trial who incorporated craved foods into a balanced meal plan lost more weight during the 12-month weight-loss program and their cravings remained minimal through the subsequent 12 months of maintenance.

Then-graduate student Nouf W. Alfouzan and nutrition professor Manabu T. Nakamura, who published their findings in the journal Physiology and Behavior, said that dieters' food cravings decreased while losing weight and remained minimal as long as they did not regain weight. The participants were part of a larger project conducted with physicians at Carle Clinic in Urbana, Illinois, that aimed to broaden the outreach of an in-person weight-loss program called the Individualized Dietary Improvement Program by converting it to an online format called EMPOWER.

"We recruited obese patients ages 18 to 75 who had comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes and could benefit from losing weight," Nakamura said. "Cravings are a big problem for many people. If they have a lot of cravings, it is very difficult to lose weight. Even when they are able to control their cravings and lose weight, if the cravings come back, they regain the weight."

Although many dieters reported in prior research that their cravings decreased while losing weight, Nakamura and Alfouzan said it remained unclear whether these changes persisted when they reached their weight-loss goal or quit dieting while trying to maintain their weight. Alfouzan, the first author of the current study, wanted to investigate that along with whether reduced cravings correlated with greater weight loss.

The dietary program used in the study educates dieters about key nutrients, helping them make informed decisions about their food selections until sustainable dietary changes are achieved, Nakamura said. Dieters used a data visualization tool that plots foods' protein, fiber and calories so they can enhance nutrition while minimizing the calories they consume.

During the first year, participants engaged in 22 online nutrition education sessions created by scholars at the university's Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning that included strategies for dealing with cravings.

"If you are eating and snacking randomly, it's very hard to control," Nakamura said. "Some dietary programs exclude certain foods. Our plan used an 'inclusion strategy,' in which people incorporated small portions of craved foods within a well-balanced meal."

Every six months participants completed a questionnaire about their cravings for specific foods. These included high-fat foods such as hot dogs and fried chicken, fast food fats like hamburgers and chips, sweets such as cakes and cookies, and carbohydrates such as biscuits and pancakes.

The researchers also assessed the frequency and intensity of participants' cravings with another survey. Using a scale ranging from 1 (never) to 6 (always), individuals rated themselves on statements such as, "Whenever I have food cravings, I find myself making plans to eat" and "I have no willpower to resist my food cravings." The intensity of each dieter's cravings was calculated by adding their scores for all 15 statements.

Dieters also weighed in daily after getting out of bed and before breakfast using a Wi-Fi scale that transmitted the data to the researchers so they could track the changes.

A total of 30 people began the weight-loss program, and the 24 who remained at the end of the first year had lost an average of 7.9% of their starting weight. Of these, 20 people completed the yearlong maintenance program, but because a few regained some of what they had lost, their average weight loss was 6.7%, the researchers found.

Participants who lost more than 5% by the end of the study experienced consistent reductions in the frequency and intensity of their cravings while those who lost less than that did not. The team also found that individuals' craving for food in general and for specific types of foods such as sweets and carbohydrates diminished during the year of weight loss and stabilized during maintenance.

This finding suggests that individuals' reduced cravings correlated with decreased body fat rather than the negative energy balance of dieting, Nakamura said. "This basically debunks the hungry fat cell theory, a longstanding hypothesis that fat cells become starved for energy and trigger cravings, causing dieters to eat and ultimately regain what they lost. But that is not the case. As long as you stay at a healthy weight, your cravings will remain low."

Of the 24 participants who remained in the study at 12 months, more than half reported they used the inclusion strategy to manage cravings, some people as frequently as one to three times a day, while others used it once a week or more. Those who used the strategy lost significantly more weight compared with other participants and experienced significant reductions in their cravings for sweet and high-fat foods, the researchers found.

Consistency is another key to managing cravings and weight, Nakamura said. "The popular myth is you have to have a very strong will to fend off temptation, but that is not the case. Fluctuations in eating patterns, meal times and amounts trigger cravings, too. You have to be consistent."

Metrics details

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is one of the most promising cancer treatments. However, different hurdles are limiting its application and efficacy. In this context, how aging influences CAR-T cell outcomes is largely unknown. Here we show that CAR-T cells generated from aged female mice present a mitochondrial dysfunction derived from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) depletion that leads to poor stem-like properties and limited functionality in vivo. Moreover, human data analysis revealed that both age and NAD metabolism determine the responsiveness to CAR-T cell therapy. Targeting NAD pathways, we were able to recover the mitochondrial fitness and functionality of CAR-T cells derived from older adults. Altogether, our study demonstrates that aging is a limiting factor to successful CAR-T cell responses. Repairing metabolic and functional obstacles derived from age, such as NAD decline, is a promising strategy to improve current and future CAR-T cell therapies.

Immunotherapeutic strategies based on adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are currently among the most promising approaches to treat cancer. Amongst the features that determine successful responses to CAR-T cell therapy, the long-term maintenance of a T cell pool with stem-like properties is fundamental1,2. As a result, the CAR-T cell field is evolving toward finding strategies that favor the quantity and quality of stem-like T cells in CAR-T infusion products1,2,3. Importantly, this stem-like population engages a particular metabolic program that relies mostly on mitochondrial activity4,5,6,7,8. Indeed, recent studies demonstrated that CAR-T cell products with decreased mitochondrial fitness are associated with poor responses9,10 and metabolic interventions boosting mitochondrial metabolism are able to improve the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy in preclinical models11,12,13,14,15.

A key metabolite that ensures mitochondrial health is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). NAD is a well-known cofactor that has a pivotal role in redox balance and energy metabolism by fueling oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, it serves as a substrate for several enzymes, such as sirtuin deacetylases (SIRTs), that can regulate the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α, a transcription cofactor involved in mitochondrial biogenesis16,17,18. NAD metabolism critically regulates T cell fate and function19,20,21. Thus, alterations in NAD homeostasis have been linked to impaired T cell responses20,22, while restoration of mitochondrial dysfunction through NAD-boosting strategies has been shown to prevent exhaustion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)23.

Aging is the first risk factor associated with cancer. Consequently, the majority (~75%) of persons with cancer and persons eligible for cancer immunotherapy are >65 years old. Importantly, in the context of CAR-T cell therapy, the highest response is observed in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) when the median diagnostic age is <20 years old, while the responses decline with increasing age24. However, whether aging is an important limiting factor for CAR-T cell efficacy and its underlying mechanisms is still unknown. Several investigations have reported that aging leads to deficient immune and metabolic functions that result in altered antitumor responses25. Interestingly, mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of aging26 and NAD decline has been described across several tissues including white adipose tissue (WAT), muscle and liver27,28,29. In our study, we demonstrate that age is a limiting factor for effective CAR-T cell responses. We show that aging drives mitochondrial dysfunction in T cells, which impairs their stem-like properties and antitumor capacities when transduced with a tumor-antigen-directed CAR. We then determine the decline in NAD cellular levels as a major factor responsible for this process and the restauration of NAD homeostasis as a strategy to rejuvenate old CAR-T cells.

To decipher how aging affects the composition of CAR-T cell infusion products, we transduced CD8+ T cells derived from young (8 weeks old) and old (>80 weeks old) mice with a Thy1.1+ CAR construct targeting the human oncogene human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, also known as ERBB2) (refs. 13,14,30). CAR-T cells were then expanded under effector-like (TEM) or memory-like (TCM) polarizing conditions (involving the use of interleukin 2 (IL-2) or IL-7 and IL-15, respectively) (Fig. 1a). Young and old CAR-T cells displayed comparable differentiation capacity when cultured in the presence of IL-2 (Fig. 1b,c). However, old CAR-T cells were unable to properly acquire a memory-like phenotype when cultured with IL-7 and IL-15, as shown by both the lower proportion of TCM cells (Fig. 1b,c) and the decreased levels of the stemness marker T cell factor 1 (TCF1) when compared to younger counterparts (Fig. 1d)31,32,33. To prove that these differences stem not only from the accumulation of experienced (CD44+) T cells with age (Extended Data Fig. 1a) but also from cell-intrinsic defects, we isolated CD8+ naive T cells (CD44−CD62L+) from young and old mice and tested their differentiation capability in vitro. Following initial activation, we expanded under TEM or TCM polarizing conditions and we observed that naive T cells derived from aged mice did not differentiate efficiently toward a TCM phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Accordingly, the TCM population had lower TCF1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 1c). These results suggest that the defective memory-like phenotype identified in aged CAR-T cell infusion products is not only because of differences in the initial population heterogeneity but also because of cell-intrinsic defects of CD8+ T cells.

a, HER2-directed CAR-T cells were generated from CD8+ T cells isolated from spleens of young (8 weeks old) and old (>80 weeks old) mice. On day 3, T cells were further expanded in the presence of IL-2 or IL-7 and IL-15. b, Representative CD44 and CD62L dot plots of young and old CAR-T cells on day 7 upon expansion with IL-2 or IL-7 and IL-15. c, Proportion of CAR-T cells with TEM (CD44+CD62L−) and TCM (CD44+CD62L+) phenotype (n = 3 biologically independent samples). d, Levels of TCF1 within the TCM population of young and old CAR-T cells on day 7 (n = 3 biologically independent samples). e, Killing capacity of young and old CAR-T cells expanded with IL-7 and IL-15 upon coculture with B16-HER2 cells at a 2:1 effector-to-target ratio.

Statistical analysis was performed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's multiple-comparison test (c,d) or unpaired t-test (f,g), as appropriate. Panel a created with BioRender.

Source data

To further assess their functionality, we rechallenged young and old CAR-T cells against HER2-overexpressing B16 melanoma cells in vitro. Aged CAR-T cells exhibited a higher killing capacity than young CAR-T cells (Fig. 1e) and an increased capacity to produce interferon-γ (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (Fig. 1f,g) when compared to young CAR-T cells, thus reflecting the acquisition of a TEM phenotype. Of note, no differences were observed between young and old CAR-T cells when cultured in the presence of IL-2 (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). Despite providing enhanced cytotoxicity, TEM cells exhibit limited proliferative and self-renewing capacities and are more prone to develop an exhausted phenotype. Indeed, old CAR-T cells under chronic stimulation in vitro had lower IFNγ and TNF production (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g), with no differences in the expression of exhaustion markers such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM3), lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3) or thymocyte selection-associated high-mobility group box protein (TOX) (Extended Data Fig. 1h–l). Altogether, these results indicate that age greatly influences the composition of CAR-T cell infusion products, favoring the accumulation of TEM cells with higher cytotoxic properties but limited functions upon multiple rechallenges.

To determine whether aging would be a limiting factor for CAR-T cell efficacy, we next challenged the HER2-directed CAR-T cells in vivo (Fig. 2a). Specifically, we adoptively transferred young and old CAR-T cells (CD45.1+) into mice (CD45.2+) bearing HER2+ B16 tumors. We observed that only CAR-T cells derived from young mice and expanded with IL-7 and IL-15 but not those derived from aged mice could control tumor growth (Fig. 2b,c). No differences were observed between young and old CAR-T cells when expanded in IL-2 (Extended Data Fig. 1m). Young CAR-T cells are able to persist long-term in vivo, generating a pool of CD44+CD62L+TCF1+ CAR-T cells in the spleen that can potentially generate tumor-specific TEM cells that can migrate to the tumor microenvironment (TME). Strikingly, the numbers of transferred (CD45.1+) and CAR-expressing (Thy1.1+) aged T cells were nearly undetectable 30 days after ACT in the spleen (Fig. 2d–f). Aged CAR-T cells completely lacked a memory or stem phenotype, as shown by the absence of CD44+CD62L+ (Fig. 2g) or TCF1+ T cells (Fig. 2h), underscoring their poor ability to persist in vivo, consistent with their TEM commitment. Interestingly, aged CAR-T cells partially improved their persistence when transferred into older hosts, suggesting that age-dependent changes in the microenvironment can also influence CAR-T persistence (Extended Data Fig. 1n; gating strategy in Extended Data Fig. 2).

Panel a created with BioRender.

The development and maintenance of stem-like properties relies on the T cell capacity to boost mitochondrial metabolism5,34,35. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been extensively studied as a hallmark of aging26,36 but whether mitochondrial defects are the main driver of the loss of stemness in aged CD8+ T cells has not yet been elucidated.

To this end, we first compared the mitochondrial profile of freshly isolated CD8+ T cells derived from the spleens of young and aged mice by examining mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial mass by staining with tetramethylrhodamine (TMRM) and MitoTracker green, respectively. CD8+ T cells presented an age-dependent drop in both mitochondrial membrane potential and mass (Fig. 3a,b). Moreover, old CD8+ T cells accumulated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Overall, these data suggest the acquisition of mitochondrial dysfunction in aged T cells, as previously reported23,37,38,39,40,41. Accordingly, old CD8+ T cells displayed a reduced basal and maximal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) upon T cell receptor stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). To demonstrate that these mitochondrial deficiencies were cell-intrinsic defects induced by aging, we proved that mitochondrial activity was dampened in all T cell populations (naive T cell (TN), TEM and TCM) (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Similarly, naive CD8+ T cells also presented an age-dependent progressive decrease in mitochondrial activity without altering mitochondrial size (Extended Data Fig. 3f–h). Electron microscopy (EM) confirmed these findings, as no differences were detected in the number or size of mitochondria (Fig. 3c,d) but aged naive CD8+ T cells had a reduced number of cristae (Fig. 3c,e), a feature of mitochondria with reduced activity.

a, TMRM and MitoTracker green staining in freshly isolated bulk CD8+ T cells from the spleens of young and old mice. TMRM is a cell-permeable dye that accumulates in active mitochondria with intact membrane potential, while MitoTracker green binds to mitochondrial proteins giving a readout of mitochondrial activity and size, respectively (n = 5 biologically independent samples). b, Representative TMRM and MitoTracker green dot plots of data summarized in a. c, EM images of young and old naive CD8+ T cells.

Cells were treated with the NAD-booster NR (1 mM) and levels of the transcription factor TOX were determined on day 12 (n = 3 biologically independent samples). Data are presented as the mean values ± s.e.m. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t-test (a,d,e), two-way ANOVA (g) or paired t-test (h), as appropriate. Statistical analysis of metabolomic data was performed using a two-way ANOVA on log10-transformed data and corrected with the Benjamini–Hochberg method. FC, fold change.

To identify age-specific mechanisms driving mitochondrial dysfunction and CAR-T cell failure, we performed liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) to analyze the metabolome of CD8+ T cells derived from young and old mice. Interestingly, aged CD8+ T cells had higher abundance for 15 metabolites, mostly related to purine and pyrimidine synthesis, such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP) riboside, adenosine monophosphate or guanosine monophosphate (Fig. 3f), and lower abundance for 11 metabolites when compared to young CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Table 1). Amongst the low-abundance metabolites, the levels of NAD were the most reduced (Fig. 3f). We and others have shown that supplementation with NAD precursors can increase NAD cellular levels and ameliorate mitochondrial function42. To this end, we treated aged and young T cells with the NAD precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and analyzed their mitochondrial activity. Interestingly, we found that, while NMN was able to improve the mitochondrial activity of young T cells, T cells derived from aged mice were irresponsive to NMN treatment (Fig. 3g). Similarly, old T cells treated with the NAD precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR), which we previously reported to prevent T cell exhaustion23, were not able to prevent TOX upregulation upon chronic in vitro stimulations, in contrast to younger counterparts (Fig. 3h). Overall, our findings demonstrate that aged CD8+ T cells accumulate important mitochondrial defects associated with NAD decline, which cannot be reversed through the administration of conventional NAD precursors.

An investigation by Camacho-Pereira et al. revealed that one of the main triggering factors of NAD decline in WAT, muscle and liver during aging is the systemic upregulation of CD38 (ref. 27). CD38 is a multifunctional enzyme that degrades NAD and modulates NAD homeostasis in a variety of immune cells43,44. CD38-mediated NAD-degradation leads to the production of substrates (namely, cyclic ADP-ribose and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate) that are subsequently involved in the regulation of Ca2+ signaling and the production of adenosine, an important metabolite with immunosuppressive functions43,44. Moreover, it has been reported that CD38 can also mediate the degradation of NAD precursors, including NMN and NR45. Thus, we tested whether CD38 could impact aged CD8+ T cells function by (1) limiting NAD metabolism and mitochondrial activity and (2) preventing responsiveness to NAD precursors. We investigated how CD38 levels change during T cell aging and we found that CD38 is expressed to a higher level in old CD8+ T cells, in both resting and activated states (Fig. 4a). Importantly, this phenomenon was observed in all CD8+ T cell populations (TN, TEM and TCM) (Extended Data Fig. 4a). To determine whether CD38 is a limiting factor of mitochondrial activity in aged CD8+ T cells, we measured mitochondrial membrane potential in T cell subpopulations with high (CD38hi) and low (CD38low) CD38 expression. Importantly, we found that, in aged CD8+ T cells but not in younger controls, only CD38hi T cells displayed reduced mitochondrial activity (Fig. 4b,c). Moreover, young CD8+ T cells transduced with a CD38-overexpressing construct exhibited a limited generation of TCM cells and decreased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c), recapitulating the features of aged CD8+ T cells. These results suggest that CD38 can modulate the mitochondrial activity and fate decision of CD8+ T cells, creating a link among CD38, aging, mitochondrial fitness and maintenance of T cell stemness.

However, CD38 is not the only enzyme impacting NAD cellular levels in aging. For instance, alterations in NAD synthesis pathways (that is, the salvage or de novo synthesis pathways) or the activation of NAD-consuming enzymes can strongly modulate NAD cellular levels28. In particular, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) have been described as the major NAD-consuming enzymes in the cell29,46, where their activation has often been associated with aging because of the accumulation of age-dependent DNA damage. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon is present in aged CD8+ T cells and can affect NAD levels and mitochondrial metabolism. To this end, we first measured DNA damage by analyzing the phosphorylation levels of γH2AX and found that aged CD8+ T cells exhibited a significant increase (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Moreover, we identified that CD38hi T cells, that is, bearing defective mitochondria (Fig. 4b), accumulated more p-γH2AX than CD38low T cells (Extended Data Fig. 4e). These results suggest that the mitochondrial defects in aged CD8+ T cells derive from a multifactorial process impacting NAD homeostasis.

Next, we aimed to elucidate whether restoration of NAD levels is sufficient to reinstate mitochondrial fitness and functionality of aged CAR-T cells. To this end, we used the small molecule 78c to specifically block the NADase activity of CD38 (ref. 47) and we combined it with NMN supplementation. We observed that, according to the previous data (Fig. 3g,h), NMN alone was not sufficient to increase NAD levels in aged CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4d). However, when combined with the CD38 inhibitor 78c, NAD levels were restored to levels seen in younger controls (Fig. 4d). Consequently, 78c + NMN supplementation during ex vivo expansion of CAR-T cells repaired the mitochondrial function of aged CAR-T cells, as shown by an increased spare respiratory capacity (SRC) and mitochondrial mass (Fig. 4e–g). Importantly, the effects of the 78c + NMN treatment were observed in aged T cells but not in younger controls, suggesting that this combination strategy is particularly beneficial in contexts where CD38 levels are aberrantly high. Furthermore, combining 78c and NMN improved the phenotype of the CAR-T infusion products, as shown by a heightened expression of CD62L within the TCM population (Fig. 4h). Similarly, inhibition of PARP activity using olaparib also rescued the NAD levels and mitochondrial activity of aged CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g).

To assess whether the recovery of the mitochondrial fitness was sufficient to restore CAR-T cell functionality in vivo, we reinfused young and old CAR-T cells with or without 78c + NMN treatment in mice bearing HER2+ B16 tumors. We observed that, whereas the untreated aged CAR-T cells were unable to control tumor growth, aged CAR-T cells supplemented with 78c + NMN efficiently controlled tumor growth in line with young CAR-T cells (Fig. 4i,j). Importantly, treated aged CAR-T cells prolonged their long-term survival in vivo, as shown by a significant increase in the number of CD44+CD62L+TCF1+ CAR-T cells found in spleens 30 days after ACT (Fig. 4k). Supplementing young CAR-T cells with NMN + 78c during the ex vivo expansion did not result in improved tumor growth control (Extended Data Fig. 5a) or increased persistence in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 5b), indicating that NMN + 78c treatment restores CAR-T cell functionality specifically in the context of aging.

Additionally, we modified the HER2 CAR construct to integrate a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for CD38 (hereafter referred as HER2 CAR_shRNA CD38) as a strategy to modulate CD38 enzymatic activity by reducing its expression. Upon transduction, both young and old CD8+ T cells presented a highly significant downregulation of CD38 protein levels (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). HER2 CAR_shRNA CD38 T cells generated from young CD8+ T cells and expanded for 7 days in the presence of IL-7 and IL-15 showed a similar TCM phenotype. Interestingly, downregulation of CD38 levels in old CAR-T cells resulted in a worsened expansion of TCM cells, even when expanded in the presence of NMN (Extended Data Fig. 6c). To assess their functionality, we transferred either old CAR_shRNA CD38 T cells, old CAR_shRNA CD38 T cells expanded with NMN or old control CAR-T cells expanded with NMN + 78c into mice bearing HER2+ B16 tumors. CD38 downregulation led to an increased number of CAR-T cells in the spleens 30 days after ACT (Extended Data Fig. 6d). However, the control CAR-T cells supplemented with NMN + 78c but not old CAR_shRNA CD38 T cells were able to successfully control tumor growth (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). These results underline the importance of specifically targeting the NADase activity of CD38 and suggest that the recovery of CAR-T cell functionality through CD38 is NAD dependent.

To validate our findings in alternative CAR-T cell models, we extended our study using anti-CD19_28z (ref. 48), which targets a different antigen and contains a different costimulatory domain. CD19-directed CAR-T cells were generated from young and old CD8+ T cells (CD45.1+) and were adoptively transferred into mice (CD45.2+) engrafted with EL4 lymphoma cancer cells overexpressing mouse CD19 (mCD19) (Fig. 4l). Tumor control capacity was monitored over time. Similarly to the B16-HER2 model, young CAR-T cells were able to successfully control tumor growth, whereas old CAR-T cells failed (Fig. 4m). Importantly, old CAR-T cells expanded in the presence of NMN and 78c recovered their functionality in vivo, as shown by improved tumor growth control (Fig. 4m). Analysis of the spleens at endpoint (day 17) further revealed an increased number of CD45.1+ T cells, indicating improved persistence (Fig. 4n).

Overall, these data demonstrates that NAD metabolism, which is greatly compromised during aging, is a key determinant of CAR-T cell successful responses. Combined strategies to boost NAD levels, such as NAD precursors together with a CD38 or PARP inhibitor, rejuvenates aged CAR-T cells, ultimately leading to improved therapeutic efficacy.

To assess the influence of aging and NAD metabolism on CAR-T clinical application, we reanalyzed recently published anti-CD19 CAR-T data from 31 participants with large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) (15 responders (R) and 16 nonresponders (NoR))49. Importantly, we found that older participants had inferior responses (Fig. 5a). Moreover, single-cell transcriptomic analysis on baseline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 20 participants with LBCL (10 R and 10 NoR) revealed differences in NAD metabolic signatures of CD8+ T cells from R and NoR participants (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 7a). These differences were also detected in natural killer (NK) cells but not in other immune cells (Extended Data Fig. 7b).

Following our previous analysis on NAD-related pathways, we focused on elucidating how CD38 is involved in CAR-T cell outcomes. We found that CD8+ T cells from NoR participants presented a tendency to express higher Cd38 baseline levels (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 7c). Similarly to the NAD signature, Cd38 levels were also lower in the NK cells of R participants (Extended Data Fig. 7d). In addition, using a transcriptomic atlas (https://tanlab4generegulation.shiyapps.io/Tcell_Atlas/)50 of premanufactured T cells from 71 participants with B-ALL, we found that increased Cd38 baseline levels across several T cell subtypes dampened CAR-T cell persistence upon infusion (Extended Data Fig. 6e), suggesting that CD38 is associated with the stemness potential of CAR-T cells. Previous investigations characterized CD38 as a marker of terminally exhausted T cells in both murine (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g) and human (Extended Data Fig. 7h) settings. Consistently, TILs of NoR participants to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) accumulate CD8+ T cell clusters that present an exhausted signature and higher Cd38 levels51, a phenomenon also observed in CD4+ T cells and myeloid cells (Extended Data Fig. 7i). Our findings, however, add to CD38 a role as a non-exhaustion-related predictive marker of CAR-T cell persistence and efficacy. Of note, other NAD-associated pathways such as DNA damage were also predictive of the response (Extended Data Fig. 7j) suggesting that general NAD signatures in baseline PBMCs could be used to predict CAR-T cell responses.

To test whether NAD metabolism could also be targeted to rejuvenate human CAR-T cells, we first analyzed PBMCs derived from participants with melanoma and found an age-dependent increased expression of CD38 in CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5d) but not in CD4+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 7k). To determine whether CD38 expression was altering mitochondrial activity, we compared TMRM staining in CD38hi and CD38low CD8+ T cells and observed that mitochondrial potential was particularly restricted in those cells expressing higher levels of CD38 (Fig. 5e).

Next, we generated human CD19 CAR-T cells containing a 41BB costimulatory domain using PBMCs derived from young (<30 years old) and old (>65 years old) healthy donors, expanded them in the presence of IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15 and compared their mitochondrial fitness (Fig. 5f). CAR-T cells generated from older donors displayed a significant reduction in SRC (Fig. 5g) and mitochondrial mass (Extended Data Fig. 7l). Remarkably, old CAR-T cells supplemented with 78c and NMN during ex vivo expansion were able to revert their mitochondrial defects and reestablish a mitochondrial profile of young CAR-T cells (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 7l). These results suggest that age-associated metabolic defects in CAR-T cells are also observed in a human setting and can be reverted by modulating NAD levels.

To further investigate the importance of aging and NAD metabolism in a clinical setting, we analyzed PBMCs derived from participants with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. We showed that older participants gradually accumulate C–C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7)lowCD45RAlow T cells while losing CCR7hiCD45RAhi T cells (Extended Data Fig. 8a). To test whether these phenotypic differences could also be observed by the end of the expansion of CAR-T cells, we generated human CAR-T cells using PBMCs from young and old participants with melanoma using the same hCD19_BBz model (Fig. 5h). We analyzed the phenotype of CAR-T cells and indeed observed that old CAR-T cells had a lower proportion of CCR7hiCD45RAhi T cells when compared to younger controls. Treatment with NMN + 78c was able to increase the proportion of this T cell subset (Fig. 5i,j). Similarly to the CAR-T cells generated from healthy donors, CAR-T cells from older participants with melanoma presented an impaired mitochondrial function that was reverted upon expansion with NMN + 78c (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Of note, these differences were also observed in a human CD19 CAR-T cell model containing a CD28 costimulatory domain (Extended Data Fig. 8c–e). Old hCD19_BBz CAR-T cells expanded using only IL-2 did not present metabolic recovery upon NMN + 78c supplementation, while showing an increased proportion of CCR7hiCD45RAhi cells (Extended Data Fig. 8f–h).

Lastly, to investigate whether the metabolic and phenotypic changes translated into recovery of the functionality of human CAR-T cells, we cocultured CAR-T cells with NALM6–GFP and tracked their killing capacity upon multiple rechallenges performed every 2–3 days. We observed few differences in killing capacity between young and old CAR-T cells at early stages (Fig. 5k,l). However, old CAR-T cells lost their tumor killing capacity upon multiple rechallenges, whereas young CAR-T cells were able to maintain it. Importantly, old human CAR-T cells treated with NMN + 78c recovered their functionality, as shown by a prolonged maintenance of killing capacity upon multiple rechallenges (Fig. 5k,l). Overall, these data indicate that age determines the phenotype, functionality and metabolic status of CAR-T cells and manipulating NAD metabolism can be used as a strategy to boost their function.

Altogether, our data demonstrate that the age-dependent NAD decline leads to mitochondrial defects and loss of stem-like properties in T cells, ultimately resulting in CAR-T cell failure. Moreover, we establish the restoration of NAD cellular levels as a strategy to recover mitochondrial function and rejuvenate CAR-T cells in the context of aging.

Several drivers of aging (for example, genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, chronic inflammation or mitochondrial dysfunction) are also common drivers of tumorigenesis, which make aging the first risk factor associated with cancer incidence52. In this context, the field of immuno-oncology has greatly expanded during the last decade; however, few studies have investigated how aging impacts immunotherapy efficacy. In the context of ICB, data acquired from preclinical models and clinical trials are currently unclear and contradictory53. In mice, some studies have shown decreased response to anti-PD1 or anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 therapy in aged mice54,55, while other studies have documented an intact or even superior response to PD1 and its ligands56. These discrepancies might be explained by the fact that the expression of PD1 and its ligands is altered during aging in a cell-specific and organ-specific manner and aging affects mutagenesis burden in the tumor, thus influencing T cell infiltration in the TME57. Overall, in ICB, there are several factors independent of the intrinsic effect of aging on T cells that can determine the response to therapy. Indeed, although it is just beginning to be appreciated24, to date, no evidence supports the notion that aging might be an important limiting factor of CAR-T cell therapy efficacy in the clinic. In this Article, we demonstrated that CAR-T cells generated from aged mice display qualitative defects associated with an inability to maintain stem-like properties. We show that the lack of stem-like properties arises from mitochondrial dysfunction derived from the decline in NAD cellular levels and its recovery is sufficient to rejuvenate the functionality of aged CAR-T cells. Moreover, we provide clinically relevant data showing that NAD metabolic pathways can be both targeted and used as predictive markers of CAR-T cell therapy efficacy.

The role of NAD metabolism in T cell function and antitumor responses has been widely explored. A report from Chatterjee et al. (2018) described a potent antitumor T helper 1 and 17 hybrid cell that was able to maintain effector functions while persisting long-term in vivo21. Interestingly, these cells were dependent on a higher NAD-dependent activity of the histone deacetylase SIRT1 (ref. 21). Other studies have also applied NAD-boosting strategies to prevent T cell exhaustion23 or ameliorate CAR-T cell and TIL therapy20,58, providing promising results in preclinical models. As a result, the use of NAD precursors, such as NR or NMN, is gaining relevance in the field of immunotherapy. However, a limitation of current preclinical studies is the lack of aged mice included within the experimental design, which might lead to real-world discrepancies and difficulties to move from bench to bedside. For example, the administration of NAD precursors as a nutritional supplement has been included in several clinical trials to treat cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases but their efficacy has been limited when applied in older subjects. In our study, we found that the sole administration of NAD precursors is indeed insufficient to improve the fitness of aged cells. These findings emphasize the need to find alternative or complementary strategies to increase NAD cellular levels and benefit from its effects. For CD8+ T cells, we explored the CD38 inhibitor 78c in combination with NAD precursors but we cannot exclude other strategies based on additional mechanisms of NAD homeostasis disturbance (PARP inhibitors in combination with NAD precursors). Nonetheless, not all cell types upregulate CD38 and might benefit from their strategy. Other immune cells, such as macrophages, present decreased activity of quinolinate and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferases during aging, both involved in NAD synthesis pathways, and recovery of their activity reinstates macrophage functionality59,60. These results show the importance of maintaining NAD homeostasis during aging for optimal immune function and suggest a tailored NAD-boosting strategy depending on the cell type and context.

Although we focused on the intrinsic defects of CAR-T cells during aging in this study, important factors to consider are the extrinsic barriers that might impede CAR-T cell efficacy. Aging also fosters an environment marked by the presence of senescent cells and systemic low-grade chronic inflammation, known as ‘inflammaging'. Several investigations have described changes in the composition of the TME with aging, including an accumulation of fibroblasts and immunosuppressive cell subsets associated with a senescence-associated secretory phenotype such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells. However, whether tumor initiation and progression are aggravated during aging is still unclear, as some reports have described faster tumor growth in aged mice while other studies support the opposite. Similarly, it is widely discussed whether senescence might have protumoral or antitumoral roles. Thus, further investigation is required to decipher the importance of an aged environment on the outcome of antitumor and immunotherapy responses.

In conclusion, our study found that aging is an important limiting factor for CAR-T cell therapy. Specifically, aged T cells present reduced NAD cellular levels that are linked to decreased mitochondrial fitness, ultimately preventing the maintenance of stem-like properties of CAR-T cells and leading to deficient long-term survival in vivo and tumor growth control. These findings emphasize the importance of using aged models in the field of cancer immunology, which can uncover mechanisms of CAR-T cell failure that are often overlooked in preclinical studies, shedding light on novel strategies that can ameliorate CAR-T cell therapy.

C57BL/6 CD45.1+ and CD45.1 × CD45.2 young (8 weeks old) and old (80–105 weeks old) female mice were bred and maintained in house. For all in vivo experiments, host C57BL/6 CD45.2+ female mice (8 weeks old) were purchased from EnVigo laboratories (C57BL/6OlaHsd). Donors and recipients of adoptive T cell transfers were sex-matched. Mice were housed at 22 °C with 55% relative humidity on a 12-h light–dark cycle. Mice were fed ad libitum with Safe-150 chow. All animal experiments were performed in the animal facility in Epalinges at the University of Lausanne (UNIL), as approved by the veterinary authorities of the canton of Vaud and performed in accordance with Swiss federal law (VD3572).

B16-HER2-mK2 and Phoenix ECO cells were a kind gift from G. Coukos (UNIL) and were cultured in RPMI 1640-Glutamax medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. EL4-mCD19 cells were a kind gift from M. L. Davila (Moffitt Cancer Center) and were cultured in RPMI 1640-Glutamax medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.

HER2-directed CAR containing a 41BBz costimulatory domain was cloned in the MSGV retroviral transfer vector as described previously13,30. For some experiments, an shRNA for silencing murine Cd38 was cloned in the HER2_41BBz vector. For retrovirus production, Phoenix ECO cells were transfected with HER2 CAR plasmid and pCL-Eco-packaging plasmid using TurboFect transfection reagent (LifeTechnologies) in OptiMEM medium (Thermo Fisher). After 48 h and 72 h, supernatants were recovered and virus was collected by ultracentrifugation (Beckman Avanti J-26). Spleens from wild-type CD45.1 or CD45.1 × CD45.2 mice were smashed through a 70-μm cell strainer. CD8+ T cells were purified using the EasySep mouse CD8+ T cell isolation kit (StemCell), according to the manufacturer's instructions. CD8+ T cells were plated at a concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells per ml and activated with Activator CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher) at a 2:1 bead-to-cell ratio in the presence of recombinant murine IL-2 (10 IU per ml; PeproTech). T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640-Glutamax medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 5 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco) and sodium pyruvate (Gibco). T cells were transduced 24 h and 48 h after activation using 48-well plates precoated with RetroNectin (20 μg ml−1; Takara). After overnight coating at 4 °C, 48-well plates were blocked for 30 min with 2% BSA in PBS, followed by a PBS wash before adding the concentrated retroviruses. Retroviruses were centrifuged for 90 min at 2,000 rcf and 32 °C. Then, T cells were added on top of the viruses and centrifuged for 10 min at 300 rcf and 25 °C. On day 3, activation beads were removed and T cells were expanded using either mouse IL-2 or human IL-7 and IL-15 (10 ng ml−1; Miltenyi Biotec). T cell media and cytokines were replaced on day 5 and transduction efficacy was assessed on day 7. Metabolic and phenotype analyses, as well as ACT for in vivo experiments, were always performed on day 7 unless otherwise stated in the figure legend. Where stated, CAR-T cells were treated with NMN (1 mM; Sigma Aldrich), 78c (200 nM; Sigma Aldrich) and/or olaparib (5 μM; Lubio Science) on days 3 and 5 after activation.

The following conjugated antibodies were used for human experiments: CD3–BV711 (clone UCHT1, 300464, Biolegend, 1/200), CD4–BV605 (clone OKT4, 317438, Biolegend, 1/200), CD8–APC (clone SK1, 344722, Biolegend, 1/200), CCR7–BV421 (clone G043H7, 353208, Biolegend, 1/100), CD45RA–PE TexasRed (clone MEM-56, MHCD45RA17, Thermo Fisher, 1/50), CD62L–PercP Cy5.5 (clone DREG-56, 304824, Biolegend, 1/200) and CD38–AF700 (clone HIT2, 303524, Biolegend, 1/200).

For assessment of intracellular markers, cells were fixed and permeabilized using FoxP3 fixation and permeabilization buffer (00-5523-00, eBioscience). For live–dead discrimination, live/dead Aqua or live/dead NIR kits were used (L34957 and L10119, LifeTechnologies). To assess mitochondrial activity and mitochondrial size, cells were stained with TMRM (T668; 25 nM) and MitoTracker Green (M7514; 100 nM) for 30 min at 37 °C. For cytokine staining, T cells were restimulated using anti-CD3ε-coated plates for 4 h in the presence of brefeldin A (420601, BioLegend, 1/1,000). For pH2AX staining, cells were stained upon fixation and permeabilization using the PECy7-conjugated anti-H2A.X (S139) antibody for 1 h at 4 °C (613420, Biolegend). The samples were acquired using the CytoFLEX S (Beckman Coulter), CytoFLEX LX (Beckman Coulter) or Aurora (Cytek Biosciences). Data analysis was performed using FlowJo (version 10.9.0).

For the HER2_41BBz-B16 model, B16-HER2 (105) cells were subcutaneously injected on the right flank of 8-week-old C57BL/6 CD45.2+ mice. After 9 days, mice were exposed to sublethal irradiation (5 Gy) followed by one round of intravenous CAR-T cell transfer (2–3 × 106 cells per mouse) performed on day 10. Before the transfer, mice were randomized to have comparative tumor volumes. For the mCD19_28z-EL4 model, EL4-mCD19 cells (5 × 105) cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of 8-week-old C57BL/6 CD45.2+ mice. After 6 days, mice were exposed to sublethal irradiation (5 Gy) followed by one round of intravenous CAR-T cell transfer (3 × 106 cells per mouse) performed on day 7. Before the transfer, mice were randomized to have comparative tumor volumes. Mice were monitored three times a week and tumor length (L; greatest longitudinal measurement) and width (W; greatest transverse measurement) were measured with a caliper. Tumor volumes (V) were calculated using the formula: V = (L × W2)/2. Mice were killed at endpoint by CO2 and, where indicated, tumors, spleens and lymph nodes were collected. As permitted by the Swiss federal law, a maximal tumor size of 1,000 m3 was reached. In some cases, this limit was exceeded on the last day of measurement and the mice were immediately killed. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications23,61. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiment.

Murine CD38 complementary DNA was synthesized and flanked with the restriction enzymes Not1 and SalI, which were cloned into a retroviral MSCV vector containing a Thy1.1 promoter. The construction of the CD38 OE vector was performed by GenScript Biotech. The sequence can be found in Supplementary Table 2.

Young and old naive CD8+ T cells were sorted using the EasySep mouse naive CD8+ T cell isolation kit (StemCell). For the analysis, EM was performed as described previously62. Sorted cells were fixed in their culture medium with glutaraldehyde (EM Sciences) at a final concentration of 2.5% in phosphate buffer (0.1 M PB pH 7.4; Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature (RT). As noted previously, they were directly postfixed by a fresh mixture of glutaraldehyde 2.5%, osmium tetroxide 1% (EM Sciences) and potassium ferrocyanide 1.5% (Sigma) in PB for 1 h at RT. The samples were then washed three times in distilled water and spun down in low-melting-point agarose 2% in H2O (Sigma), left to solidify on ice, cut into 1-mm3 cubes and dehydrated in acetone solution (Sigma) at graded concentrations (30%, 40 min; 50%, 40 min; 70%, 40 min; 100%, 1 h twice). This was followed by infiltration in Epon (Sigma) at graded concentrations (Epon 1:3 acetone, 2 h; Epon 3:1 acetone, 2 h; Epon 1, 1–4 h; Epon 1, 1–12 h) and finally polymerized for 48 h at 60 °C in oven. Ultrathin sections of 50 nm were cut on a Leica Ultracut (Leica Mikrosysteme) and picked up on a copper slot grid (2 × 1 mm; EM Sciences) coated with a PEI film (Sigma). Sections were poststained with uranyl acetate 2% (Sigma) in H2O for 10 min, rinsed several times with H2O followed by Reynolds lead citrate in H2O (Sigma) for 10 min and rinsed several times with H2O. Micrographs were recorded with a transmission EM instrument (Philips CM100, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a TemCam-F416 digital camera (TVIPS). Image analysis and quantification were carried out using ImageJ software (version 2.16.0). The number of mitochondria per cell was quantified. For assessing mitochondrial cristae, each dot represents the crista number in one mitochondrion from one high-magnitude EM image of a live cell.

OCRs were determined using a Seahorse Bioanalyzer XFe96. Briefly, CD8+ T cells were resuspended in Seahorse XF basic medium supplemented with 10 mM glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM glutamine (pH 7.4, at 37 °C). CD8+ T cells were plated in a Cell-Tak-coated (22.4 μg ml−1) Seahorse XFe96 microplate (2 × 105 cells per well). The injection ports were loaded with 1 μM oligomycin, 2 μM carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) and 0.5 μM rotenone–antimycin. During sensor calibration, cells were incubated in a 37 °C non-CO2 incubator for 45 min. Data were analyzed using Seahorse Wave (version 2.4.3).

To determine the killing capacity of murine CAR-T cells, the IncuCyte ZOOM system was used. Specifically, 104 B16-HER2 cells containing the red fluorescent protein mK2 were plated in flat-bottom 96-well plates. After 4 h of incubation, young or old CAR-T cells expanded with IL-2 or IL-7 and IL-15 were added on top at a 2:1 effector-to-target ratio. Upon coculture, plates were placed immediately in the IncuCyte ZOOM system for 3 days. Killing capacity was determined by quantifying the red area and normalizing to negative controls (that is, B16-HER2 mK2 cells cultured in the absence of CAR-T cells). To evaluate the killing capacity of human CAR-T cells upon multiple rechallenges, 103 NALM6–GFP cells were seeded in a flat-bottom 96-well plate and CAR-T cells were added at an effector-to-target ratio of 1:4. Subsequently, 105 NALM6–GFP cells were added every 2–3 days for repeated tumor challenges. The cytotoxic activity of CAR-T cells was monitored over 23 days by measuring the GFP signal density (objects per mm²) using the IncuCyte ZOOM system.

The intracellular level of different metabolites was determined by performing LC–MS/MS analysis. For metabolite extraction, cell lysates were extracted by the addition of methanol and H2O (4:1), followed by homogenization with ceramic beads in the Cryolys Precellys 24 sample homogenizer. Homogenized extracts were then centrifuged for 15 min at 4,000g and 4 °C and the resulting supernatant was collected and evaporated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator. Dried extracts were resuspended in methanol and H2O before LC–MS/MS analysis. Raw LC–MS/MS data were processed using the Agilent Quantitative analysis software. Raw data can be found in Supplementary Table 1.

For NAD and reduced NAD (NADH) quantification, the NAD/NADH quantitation kit (SigmaAldrich) was used. For each sample, 1 × 106 cells per sample were collected and the manufacturer's instructions were followed.

DNA was isolated using the DNeasy kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the mtDNA-tonDNA ratio, qPCR was performed using Power SYBR green master mix (Thermo Fisher) and analyzed on the 7900HT system (Applied Biosystems) to estimate the relative values for mtDNA (COX1) and nDNA (NDUFV1).

CD8+ T cells were isolated and activated using plates coated with Ultra-LEAF anti-mouse CD3e (3 μg ml−1, Biolegend) and soluble Ultra-LEAF anti-mouse CD28 (1.5 μg ml−1, Biolegend). After 3 days, cells were washed and expanded for 4 days in the presence of IL-7 and IL-15. On days 7, 9 and 11, CD8 T cells were restimulated using CD3-coated plates. Fresh medium and IL-7 and IL-15 were added to the wells at the time of restimulation. Where indicated, cells were treated with NR (1 mM) on days 7, 9 and 11. Phenotypic and functional readouts were performed on day 12.

Human blood samples were obtained from healthy young donors (aged 25–28 years) and elderly donors (aged 66–70 years). To generate CAR-T cells, CD3+ T cells were negatively isolated using the RosetteSep human T cell enrichment cocktail (StemCell, 15061). T cells were treated with ACK lysis buffer (Gibco, A10492-01) and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, 21875158) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, 11360-070) and 10 mM HEPES (Gibco, 15630-056). For stimulation, T cells were cultured with CD3/CD28-activating Dynabeads (Gibco, 11132D) at a 1:1 bead-to-cell ratio. The following day, T cells were transduced with the hCD19_41BBz (FMC63 scFv) or hCD19_CD28z lentiviral vector at a multiplicity of infection of 4. Recombinant human IL-2 (Proleukin, Roche) or a cytokine combination of IL-2, IL-7 (Peprotech, 200-07) and IL-15 (Peprotech, 200-15) was added every other day to a final concentration of 30 IU per ml and 10 ng ml−1, respectively. Cells were counted and fed every 2 days until day 10, after which they were cryopreserved. All T cell functional assays were conducted in media without cytokines. For the generation of CAR-T cells from participants with melanoma, 2 × 105 frozen PBMCs from young (aged 40–44 years) and elderly (aged 79–84 years) donors were seeded in a round-bottom 96-well plate and processed as described above.

Donations from healthy volunteers were approved by the Comission Cantonale d'Ethique de la Recherche Genève (CCER). Samples from participants with cancer were taken from a biobank supported by the study protocol CCER 2016-01237. Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals.

An scRNA-seq dataset of human baseline PBMCs from 20 participants with LBCL was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE197268). Metadata on age and response to therapy were obtained from the supplementary material of the associated publication49. To exclude low-quality cells and outliers, the following quality control filters were applied on the scRNA-seq data: percentage of mitochondrial genes < 25%, number of detected genes = 300–5,000, number of UMIs = 500–20,000 and log10 genes per UMI > 0.6. Raw counts were normalized using a standard log1p normalization implemented in Seurat (version 5.0.1)63. Broad cell types for each scRNA-seq sample were predicted using the scGate tool and its default PBMC model64. CD8 T cell subtypes were annotated using ProjecTILs65 and a published reference map of human CD8 T cell subtypes66. Gene signatures for NAD metabolism and DNA repair were downloaded from MSigDB67 under the ‘Gene Ontology biological process' subset. On the basis of these gene sets, signature scores were calculated using the UCell method with default parameters68. Statistical comparisons (Wilcoxon test) were performed at the sample level by averaging signature scores for each participant and cell type. To assess the expression of CD38 in the context of markers of stemness and exhaustion, we interrogated two multistudy reference maps of murine65 and human66 tumor-infiltrating T cells. For each T cell subtype, we calculated the normalized average expression of CD38, HAVCR2, TOX and TCF7.

All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 10.0.3. The sample size (n) is stated in each figure legend together with the statistical test adopted. Data are shown as the mean ± s.e.m. P values < 0.05 were considered significant. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. All statistical tests used were two-sided.

With grim prognosis hanging overhead, doctors and scientists at universities and institutions across the U.S. worked tirelessly to develop the world's first custom gene-editing therapy to save the life of a newborn.

Here's what you'll learn in this story.

Life's ability to successfully copy three billion distinct letters in the human genome is an absolute biological wonder—but sometimes, mistakes are made. Whether inherited or formed in utero, genetic disorders and other birth defects are common, and occur in one in every 33 babies in the U.S., according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For all of human history, a person born with such a disorder likely had to live with the condition, and depending on the defect, those lives could be brutally short. 

But in 2025, human history changed forever. 

In a groundbreaking announcement, detailed in a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, scientists, doctors, and specialists from institutions around the U.S.—including the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of California-Berkeley, and Penn Medicine—successfully saved the life of a newborn patient named KJ, who had been born with a rare genetic disorder. To pull off this incredible medical feat, doctors employed the world's first custom in vivo (i.e. inside a living organism, rather than in a petri dish) CRISPR gene therapy. This technique, developed over decades thanks to U.S.-funded medical research, could help alleviate painful lives for millions of people born every year with now-fixable genetic disorders. 

“Years and years of progress in gene editing and collaboration between researchers and clinicians made this moment possible, and while KJ is just one patient, we hope he is the first of many to benefit from a methodology that can be scaled to fit an individual patient's needs,” Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement.

The details of this incredible medical intervention play out like a made-for-tv medical drama, but the stakes were incredibly real and deadly serious. A week after his birth, doctors noticed something wasn't quite right with KJ. After ruling out a few possibilities, they stumbled across the unfortunate answer—a rare genetic disorder called severe carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency that affects only one in every 1.3 million babies. This disorder inhibits the body's ability to get rid of ammonia, a product of protein metabolism. This can have deadly consequences, impact brain development, and wreak havoc on the liver. Usually, the treatment for a disorder like this is a liver transplant, but that was not an option for the infant boy, who was still too young to be considered for the surgery.

So, once arriving at a diagnosis, Ahrens-Nicklas contacted a gene-editing specialist at the University of Pennsylvania named Kiran Musunuru and “the clock start[ed]in my mind,” he later told The New York Times. Working with a team of specialists across the country for six months, Ahrens-Nicklas and Musunuru developed a targeted gene therapy to fix KJ's specific variant of CPS1. Meanwhile, KJ was kept under medical surveillance at the hospital and subsisted on a diet completely devoid of protein to avoid making his condition worse. By the time the CRISPR treatment was ready, KJ was in the 7th percentile for his weight. 

On February 25, the team began administering the treatment, with Ahrens-Nicklas and Musunuru describing the process as both exciting and terrifying. 

“One of the most terrifying moments was when I walked into the room and said, ‘I don't know if it will work but I promise I will do everything I can to make sure it is safe,'” Ahrens-Nicklas told The New York Times. 

The first infusion took two hours, and within two weeks, KJ began eating protein like a healthy baby. A second dose arrived 22 days later, and about two weeks ago, KJ received a third. Although it's unknown if he will eventually still need a liver transplant, doctors can now safely say that a human life has been saved thanks to the world's first bespoke in vivo gene therapy—a huge testament to decades of a research and experimentation. KJ is now at home with his family.

“We want each and every patient to have the potential to experience the same results we saw in this first patient, and we hope that other academic investigators will replicate this method for many rare diseases and give many patients a fair shot at living a healthy life,” Musunuru said in a press statement. “The promise of gene therapy that we've heard about for decades is coming to fruition, and it's going to utterly transform the way we approach medicine.”

Inside the Bold Geoengineering Work to Refreeze the Arctic's Disappearing Ice

Researchers are trying to rebuild sea ice above the Arctic Circle so it can reflect the sun's warming rays, slowing climate change

By Alec Luhn edited by Mark Fischetti

A team with Real Ice prepares to drill through sea ice in the Canadian Arctic, having already flooded a nearby patch (darker blue) to thicken it.

Taylor Roades

This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center's Ocean Reporting Network.

A haze of ice crystals in the air created a halo around the low sun as three snowmobiles thundered onto the sea ice on a February morning in far northern Canada. Wisps of snow blew across the white expanse. It was –26 degrees Celsius as we left Cambridge Bay, an Inuit village in a vast archipelago of treeless islands and ice-choked channels. This temperature was relatively warm—six degrees C above average. The winter had been the mildest in 75 years. The sea ice covering the Arctic Ocean was at its smallest extent on record. Scientists predict that within the next 15 years this ice cap will disappear in summer for the first time in millennia, accelerating global warming. The U.K. company Real Ice, whose heavily bundled team was bouncing around on the other two snowmobiles ahead of mine, hopes to prevent that outcome with an effort that has been called extremely ambitious, insane or even dangerous.

At a spot seven kilometers from the village, Real Ice co-founder Cían Sherwin, an Irishman with a red beanie and scraggy goatee, hopped off his snowmobile and started drilling with a long electric auger. A gob of water and frozen shavings sloshed up and out of the hole as he punctured the underside of the ice more than a meter below. Inuit guide David Kavanna widened the opening with a spearlike ice saw, then placed a wood box around it. Sherwin lowered an aluminum pump, which looked like a large coffee urn attached to a curved rubber hose, through the hole. He plugged a cable into a battery pack. After a few seconds water began pouring out of the hose, spilling onto the ice in an ethereal shade of blue. As it congeals, “the water acts almost like lava,” Sherwin said. “The ice formation starts almost instantly.”

Thin, broad sheets of ice expand from the ice cap's edges in winter, when it's dark and cold, and melt away in summer, when the sun shines 24 hours a day. The ice acts like a giant mirror, reflecting up to 90 percent of the sun's radiation back toward space. Ocean water, in contrast, absorbs 90 percent of sunlight. The ice cap's core of so-called multiyear ice, which persists year-round, has shrunk by about 40 percent in four decades, kicking off a vicious cycle: as more ice melts, more ocean water is exposed, and that water warms further, melting even more ice. If the ice starts disappearing entirely in summer, global temperatures could rise an extra 0.19 degree C by 2050.

Real Ice is trying to thicken seasonal ice so it lasts longer into the warm months, keeping the planet cool. Sherwin hopes pumping could someday refreeze a million square kilometers of both seasonal and multiyear ice—an area the size of Texas and New Mexico combined and about a fifth of what's now left in summer—to stop the ice cap's death spiral. All it would take, Real Ice says, is half a million ice-making robots.

Polar geoengineering on such an enormous scale could help slow warming until the world finally weans itself off coal, oil and natural gas. Many scientists think it will never work. The researchers at Real Ice argue we no longer have any option but to try; studies suggest that even slashing fossil-fuel use may not save summertime sea ice. “It's sad that it's ended up that way, but we've got to do something about it,” Sherwin said to me out on the frozen plain. “Emissions reduction is just not enough anymore.”

Cambridge Bay, which British explorers named for a 19th-century Duke of Cambridge, is a town of 1,800 mostly Inuit inhabitants located across from the Canadian mainland on Victoria Island, one of the world's largest islands. When I landed at the one-room airport on a twin-engine turboprop, I was greeted by a stuffed musk ox and a placard about the 1845 British naval expedition of John Franklin. Cambridge Bay lies along the Northwest Passage, an icy sea route between Europe and Asia sought by explorers for 400 years. Franklin's two ships, Erebus and Terror, were trapped in the polar sea ice that surges down toward Cambridge Bay in winter, buckling into ridges up to 10 meters high. All 129 men onboard died of cold, starvation or disease. These days cruise ships coast through the passage every year, often visiting grave sites of Franklin expedition members.

The Inuit call Cambridge Bay Ikaluktutiak, meaning “good fishing place.” For millennia their nomadic ancestors came here to fish Arctic char, a silvery-orange cousin of the brook trout. Inuit started living here full-time in the 1940s and 1950s, when the U.S. military hired them to help build a navigation tower and a radar station to detect Soviet bombers coming over the pole. The cold war also led to the idea of controlling the Arctic environment. The U.S.S.R. discussed destroying sea ice with coal dust or explosions and detonated three nuclear devices to try to excavate an Arctic canal. In the U.S., physicist Edward Teller's Project Plowshare nearly got approval to gouge out a harbor in Alaska with atomic bombs.

Geoengineering today is intended to cool Earth to fend off climate change. Some scientists and entrepreneurs are focused on dispersing sulfate particles in the stratosphere to block sunlight, which could lessen heating but also disrupt global weather patterns such as the South Asian monsoon. Mexico recently announced a ban on this solar geoengineering after Silicon Valley start-up Make Sunsets launched two balloons full of sulfur dioxide there. The city of Alameda, Calif., halted an experiment to spray sea-salt particles skyward to make clouds more reflective. Field trials targeting the Arctic, the Antarctic and the “third pole” of colossal glaciers in the Himalayas have stirred up less controversy, perhaps because unintended consequences would be confined largely to those distant places. In Iceland and India, Silicon Valley nonprofit Bright Ice Initiative has scattered tiny glass beads on glaciers to try to reflect more sunlight and slow the melting. Chinese agencies have blown chemical smoke into clouds with rockets, planes, drones and chimneys to provoke snowfall over glaciers on the Tibetan plateau. Researchers in Scandinavia are developing giant curtains that could be anchored to the seabed to block warm ocean water from melting the undersides of ice shelves in Antarctica. Billions of dollars would be needed to affect the climate.

The idea for thickening ice came from outer space. At a 2012 conference a fractious forum about global warming soured Arizona State University astrophysicist Steve Desch's hopes for quick climate action. Desch, who studies icy bodies such as Pluto's moon Charon, wondered whether we could buy time by making ice in the Arctic. The problem is that sea ice freezes from below. Once the first layer forms, it insulates the seawater from the air, which can be 50 degrees C colder. The thicker the ice gets, the slower it grows. In 2016 Desch published a paper proposing that wind-powered pumps could thicken sea ice by pulling up water from below and spraying it across the top.

Around that time, students at Bangor University in Wales were inspired by a documentary on the Arctic to construct a “re-icing machine,” an ungainly spindle of hoses that twirled like a lawn sprinkler. One of those students was Sherwin. Encouraged by Desch's paper, he and London entrepreneur Simon Woods founded Real Ice in 2022 to see whether sea-ice thickening could scale up. They eventually recruited Desch and several sea-ice scientists as advisers. The company put its first water onto ice in Nome, Alaska, in January 2023, ditching the sprinkler for a commercial pump. They moved to the Canadian High Arctic Research Station in Cambridge Bay the next year to do more. “It's not exactly the same as a natural process, but it's as close as you can get,” Desch says.

After the team drilled the first hole that February morning and started the pump, we snowmobiled to a destination pinpointed by GPS several hundred meters away. Again the group drilled and inserted a pump, and water began whooshing out. In all, we installed four pumps in four places. As water pooled, the edges crept outward, soaking into the pockmarked snow, which was up to 25 centimeters (10 inches) thick and crusty like hardened white frosting. Within hours the pool would coagulate into electric-blue slush, like a gas station Slurpee.

After a lunch of fruit bars and potato chips around a tiny gas heater in the team's rescue tent, we went to a site the crew had pumped a day earlier. Under a dusting of snow lay flat gray ice. With a drill bit almost as tall as himself, one of the volunteers bored a hole and dropped in a measuring tape with fold-out brass arms at its end. The ice was 152 centimeters thick; almost 30 centimeters of ice had been added, compared with untouched sites they measured.

The ice would thicken further in coming weeks. Because snow is a better insulator than ice—this quality is why igloos work so well—flooding and freezing the snow could allow more cold to penetrate to the ice's underside, creating more ice. After Real Ice thickened 4,100 square meters of ice here in winter 2023–2024, the crew came back in May 2024 to find a significant increase. Across the area they had pumped, ice thickness was 1.9 meters, compared with 1.44 meters in other places. “Ice growth from below—that's the really efficient part,” Woods told me as he drilled a measuring hole at another refrozen site.

But snow is also a better mirror than ice, which could complicate the picture. Sea ice covered by snow reflects 90 percent of solar radiation, whereas bare sea ice reflects 50 to 70 percent. Real Ice would need snow to accumulate in spring to replenish the snow it flooded in winter, or the process could increase melting.

That's just one way flooding snow could backfire. As seawater freezes, the salt in it is ejected from the ice crystals, leading ever saltier pockets of brine to form on the surface. Salt lowers the freezing point of ice, whether on winter roads or the sea. If pumping seawater leaves more salt on the surface in summertime, it could end up accelerating the disappearance of the ice.

So far this doesn't seem to be happening. On another morning Woods put a hollow red barrel on the drill and bored into the ice at a refrozen site to extract an ice core about as long and thick as his arm. He held it up to the pale sun, which illuminated hairline channels where the salty fluid had eaten its way through the ice. “This natural process helps the brine to migrate back into the ocean,” he said.

It's still not clear how ice thickening will affect sea life, starting with the microscopic algae that grow on the underside of the ice. They're eaten by zooplankton, which are eaten by fish, which are eaten by mammals. On a different morning I snowmobiled with University of Alaska Fairbanks marine biologist Brendan Kelly to a low ridge formed by two enormous plates of ice pushing together. A polar science adviser in President Barack Obama's administration, Kelly has studied seals and polar bears for more than four decades. In that time he's also watched fossil-fuel emissions march steadily upward. So despite his discomfort with geoengineering, he agreed to advise Real Ice.

In the hazy light, the monochrome landscape seemed devoid of life. But as we crunched on foot along the snow caking the ridge, Kelly stopped to point out an Arctic fox footprint. Farther on he found a urine stain, then desiccated green scat, then a small pit. “Seal, probably,” Kelly said. In spring, ringed seals claw holes through snowdrifts. They hide their fuzzy white pups in these lairs while they dive for fish and crustaceans. Foxes and polar bears dig around to try to find the pups. Kelly scooped at the firm snow, tiny icicles swaying from his white mustache, but couldn't find a lair.

Polar bears also depend on snow. They excavate dens in larger drifts to warm their cubs, which are born the size of a guinea pig. Most Arctic snow tends to fall in late autumn. It's unknown whether enough new snow would build up after wintertime ice thickening for bears and seals to make dens in spring. Of course, polar bears and seals are already expected to decline as their sea-ice habitat melts away. Is Real Ice doing more harm than good by pumping seawater into this environment, melting the snow? “We don't know that,” Kelly said. “But we need to know it.”

Across two months last winter, Real Ice pumped water through almost 200 holes. Drills and snowmobiles broke, team members got frostnip, and Arctic foxes chewed through long, thin thermistor cables used to measure temperature in the snow and ice. The researchers thickened 250,000 square meters of sea ice. The ice cap is losing 300,000 times that area every year.

The key to scaling up is to “bring the engineering underwater,” Sherwin told me later. The Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa, Italy, is developing an underwater drone two meters long that will bore through ice from below with a heated pipe and start pumping water up through it. In renderings, it looks like a folding pocketknife with a pipe instead of a blade. Real Ice hopes to test a prototype this year, says co-CEO Andrea Ceccolini, an Italian computer scientist and investor who joined the company in 2022.

The plan is to thicken 100 square kilometers of sea ice in winter 2027–2028 to demonstrate the technique to governments and investors. The approach verges on the fantastic. A swarm of 50 drones would melt holes in minutes and pump water as their infrared cameras monitored the progress. Technicians on a floating or onshore hub would swap out the drones' batteries, plugging the old ones into chargers powered by wind turbines or by green hydrogen or ammonia brought in by ship. Tapping into electricity from Canada's Nunavut region would contribute to climate change because most of it is generated from diesel fuel.

The ultimate goal of thickening one million square kilometers of sea ice would take an estimated 500,000 drones, which would consume two terawatt-hours of electricity and require 20,000 people to service them, according to rough math Ceccolini has done. The cost would be $10 billion annually. The drones would vastly exceed the 3,800 Argo robot sensors circulating in oceans worldwide, and drone experts say a revolution in battery technology would be needed.

How much global warming could be countered through sea-ice preservation depends on numerous variables affecting sunlight and melt dynamics. Preserving a million square kilometers of sea ice for one additional summer month would cool Earth as much as removing 930 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over 20 years, Real Ice estimates. For these results, $10 billion is actually cheap, Ceccolini says, and the cooling would be immediate. Capturing that much CO2 from the air with existing machines would currently cost at least $465 billion. For perspective, humanity emits 910 million tons of CO2 every eight days, with no end in sight. Thickening sea ice is a Band-Aid “while you cure the patient—the planet—properly,” Ceccolini says.

Every day in Cambridge Bay, after three or four hours of flooding, the team used an ice ax to hack each pump out of its hole. Fat white frost flowers formed on top of the solidifying surface. The speed of the freeze was striking—but so was the immensity of the frozen plain stretching to the horizon. It was hard to envision hundreds of thousands of drones popping through the ice day after day, all winter long, for decades.

The only highway in Cambridge Bay is the sea ice. In winter and spring, Inuit residents snowmobile hundreds of kilometers over it to go ice fishing and hunt musk ox and seals, local hunter Brandon Langan told me in his living room, a black musk ox hide hanging behind him. He works part-time for Real Ice flying airborne drones to monitor the thickened ice's reflectivity. When the ice recedes in summer, the Inuit fish the Arctic char that run into the bay from lakes and streams. When ice returns in fall, they hunt the caribou that cross it to the mainland. Two out of every three meals are fish or game. “Sea ice, to us, it's life,” Langan said. “It helps us get our food. It gives us our clothing.”

Now hunters who used to start moving on the ice in October have to delay until December. A few have even fallen through. In spring, the ice cracks and melts sooner. Ice loss has diminished the local caribou herd by 90 percent; the animals go hungry waiting to cross, and when bottled up for too long on the shore, they're easier prey for wolves. Hundreds of caribou have drowned after breaking through the ice. One hunter who had previously been a guide for Real Ice told me at the cultural center in the high school library that he hopes ice thickening could rejuvenate game populations.

Inuit insights are vital. Throughout history scientists and explorers often ignored Indigenous knowledge of the Arctic. The last time anyone saw the Franklin expedition was when Inuit hunters encountered starving sailors dragging a lifeboat across the ice in Washington Bay, clad in wool rather than furs. Franklin was dead, and the remaining explorers traded the Inuit beads for seal meat—they apparently didn't know how to hunt seal themselves. Later, native people found mutilated bodies farther south, indicating the explorers had resorted to cannibalism. Charles Dickens dismissed these reports, which were later confirmed, as “the wild tales of a herd of savages” and suggested the Inuit had slain Franklin's men. This colonial mindset would persist as the Arctic came under government control. Canada and Alaska took Indigenous children, including some from Cambridge Bay, away to be reeducated in abusive residential schools, where thousands died.

A week after I met with Langan I talked with Inuit Circumpolar Council international chairwoman Sara Olsvig, who has spoken out against testing the seabed-curtain idea in her native Greenland. She says governments need to start regulating geoengineering, and researchers need to seek the free, prior and informed consent of local communities. When somebody claims, “‘We need your piece of land in the name of a greater good,' that's exactly what happened when we were colonized,” Olsvig says.

Real Ice obtained permits from Nunavut's Inuit government, as well as the Cambridge Bay hunters-and-trappers organization. Ceccolini says the operation will shut down if ice thickening proves ineffective or damaging. Although the company may patent its drone technology, its articles of association prohibit it from distributing profits. But it would consider founding a new company with Indigenous part-ownership if it decided to scale up, Ceccolini says.

Local elders are hesitant. They gather at the cultural center on weekdays to sew fur boots and mittens and speak the local language. During a break for black tea and candied Arctic char, I asked three of them about the sea-ice thickening. They would be concerned about the drones if Real Ice conducted its 100-square-kilometer demonstration, a key step to scaling up, in the strait near Cambridge Bay rather than farther north. “If they start doing that under the water, we're going to get no more fish, no more seal, no more nothing,” said Annie Atighioyak, who was born in an igloo on the sea ice in 1940.

As global fossil-fuel emissions keep rising, attitudes about geoengineering are starting to change. Two weeks before I arrived in Cambridge Bay I went to an annual Arctic science conference at the Oceanographic Institute of Monaco. Frederik Paulsen, a Swedish pharmaceutical billionaire in a tailored suit and rimless glasses, took the podium. Though not a scientist, Paulsen was the first person to reach all eight poles—the geographic, geomagnetic, magnetic and least accessible poles of each hemisphere—and was onboard one of the two submersibles that planted a Russian flag on the North Pole seabed in 2007.

In 2023, while flying over Greenland in an ultralight aircraft, Paulsen was startled to notice that the once brilliant ice sheet was turning darker as less fresh snow fell. He said he decided only “more drastic solutions” could avoid catastrophic climate impacts, given our failure to rein in fossil fuels. It's not enough to just study climate, he scolded the scientists. “Now is the time to act.”

The University of the Arctic, a network of educational institutions that Paulsen chairs, has rated the feasibility of 61 polar interventions, from spraying glaciers with ski-resort snow guns to cables that stop icebergs from drifting south. At the conference, John Moore, a University of Lapland glaciologist, presented the seabed-curtain idea. Also there was Fonger Ypma of Arctic Reflections, a Dutch sea-ice-thickening company that has done field trials in Newfoundland and Svalbard. Last year he went to Cambridge Bay to learn from Real Ice, but he hopes to deploy large movable pumping platforms rather than drones.

Frost flowers form when very cold, still air rests on newly formed ice (at left), which is relatively much warmer. Vapor rising from the ice rapidly crystalizes, creating the flowers.

The surge of interest has created a schism in polar science. In October 2024 a preprint paper by 42 top glaciologists condemned ice thickening and other polar geoengineering techniques as dangerous and unfeasible. Seabed curtains could disrupt nutrient flows to CO2-consuming phytoplankton. Spreading tiny glass spheres across mountain glaciers could decrease the reflectivity of ice covered in fresh snow. But the overarching concern is that geoengineering fixes are “making decarbonization a lot less attractive,” according to Heidi Sevestre, one of the paper's authors, who visited an Arctic Reflections trial last year. What they are offering “doesn't attack the cause of the issue, the fossil fuels,” she says.

At the Monaco conference, Kim Holmén, a Norwegian Polar Institute climate scientist who has spent more than three decades on Svalbard, the fastest-warming place on Earth, argued that trying to undo the harms of our technology with even more technology was folly. “I make mistakes every day, you make mistakes every day, and if we create a system where it must work every day, it will fail,” he said. Critics say it would be more effective to put geoengineering funds toward cutting emissions.

The amount being spent on Arctic geoengineering is small but growing. Arctic Reflections has raised $1.1 million and Moore $2 million. Real Ice's directors have committed $5 million to its ice-thickening project, only a fraction of the cost for a 100-square-kilometer demonstration. It's hard to imagine state agencies allocating $10 billion a year for sea-ice thickening, especially with China, Russia and reportedly the U.S. looking to develop Arctic shipping routes; for them, less ice is better. Brazil's Amazon Fund for rainforest conservation, which Real Ice has held up as a possible funding model, has collected only $780 million from governments.

Private investors might mean fewer political obstacles. In March, Paulsen, who's offering a €100,000 prize for projects “reversing Arctic change,” convened a dinner in Geneva to introduce geoengineering researchers—including a Real Ice adviser—to two dozen potential donors. He wants to hold similar “adopt-a-billionaire” gatherings in the U.S. He also claims he's discussed geoengineering with officials from the Trump administration, which withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. The administration didn't respond to a request for comment.

Real Ice and Arctic Reflections would like to eventually sell “cooling credits,” a strategy used by Make Sunsets. Individuals and companies that want to compensate for their CO2 emissions pay that start-up to launch balloons full of sunlight-blocking sulfur dioxide. Carbon credits have paid for the planting of trees to remove tens of millions of tons of CO2 from the atmosphere. But the credit arrangements also have been criticized as a “license to pollute” to avoid fossil-fuel reductions. Some of the biggest buyers are tech firms such as Microsoft, whose emissions are swelling as the company builds AI data centers.

Kelly, the former White House adviser, is indeed worried that geoengineering could be “hijacked” by oil or tech companies as an excuse to continue business as usual. But he's more concerned about the gigantic geoengineering experiment he says we're already conducting by emitting tens of billions of tons of greenhouse gases every year. Ice companies just have to be willing to shut down their technology if it starts harming nature or undermining climate goals, he told me as we drank coffee at the research station in Cambridge Bay. They have to be willing to turn back, unlike Franklin and other overconfident explorers who came here to discover the Northwest Passage. “We all have to keep asking ourselves and checking ourselves and one another: Have we slid into hubris?” Kelly said. “The alternative is to think [we humans] know what's best, that we can get through the passage.”

DNA Studies Uncover Unexpected Evolutionary Changes in Modern Humans

Mounting evidence from genome studies indicates that, contrary to received wisdom, our species has undergone profound biological adaptation in its recent evolutionary past

By Kermit Pattison edited by Kate Wong

Chris Gash

The Indigenous peoples of the Bolivian highlands are survivors. For thousands of years they have lived at altitudes of more than two miles, where oxygen is about 35 percent lower than at sea level. This type of setting is among the harshest environments humans have ever inhabited. Scientists have recognized for some time that these residents of the Andes Mountains have evolved genetic adaptations to the thin air of their lofty home. Now researchers are learning that they have also evolved another remarkable genetic adaptation since their ancestors first settled the highlands of South America around 10,000 years ago.

In the volcanic bedrock of the Andes, arsenic is naturally abundant and leaches into the drinking water. The dangers it poses are well known: inorganic arsenic is associated with cancers, skin lesions, heart disease, diabetes and infant mortality in other populations. But the biochemistry of Andeans has evolved to efficiently metabolize this notoriously toxic substance. Populations in Bolivia—along with groups in Argentina and Chile—have evolved variants around the gene AS3MT, which makes enzymes that break down arsenic in the liver. It is a prime example of natural selection, the evolutionary process by which organisms adapt to their environments to survive longer and produce more offspring. Apparently natural selection among the Uru, Aymara and Quechua peoples of the Bolivian Altiplano took DNA sequences that are present but rare in other populations around the world and increased their frequency to the point where the normally uncommon sequences are predominant in these groups. The case is one of many discoveries of relatively recent biological adaptation that could upend a long-standing idea about the evolution of our species.

For most of the 21st century many evolutionary biologists have assumed that humans evolved at a leisurely pace in recent millennia, in contrast to the dramatic transformations that occurred earlier in our prehistory. The oldest known members of the human family evolved in Africa around six million to seven million years ago and looked apelike in many ways. Our own species, Homo sapiens, arose in Africa a few hundred thousand years ago and began venturing into other parts of the world in significant numbers around 60,000 years ago. By that point our physical appearance seems to have settled into an evolutionary plateau, with only minor differences among human populations around the globe. After natural selection had worked its wonders for millions of years, transforming small-brained quadrupeds into large-brained bipeds, it appeared that biological evolution had slowed to a crawl in our lineage as H. sapiens developed agriculture, founded civilizations and transformed the planet.

Early studies of the DNA of modern people turned up few fixed differences—genetic variants possessed exclusively by one population—which seemed to confirm this apparent stasis. Consequently, many scholars believed that the latest chapter of the human saga revolved around cultural changes rather than biological ones—figuring out more reliable means of obtaining food instead of changing our digestive or metabolic systems, for instance.

But advances in the sequencing of ancient and modern DNA have allowed scientists to look more closely at how our genetic code has evolved over time—and the results are startling. Genetic studies suggest that H. sapiens experienced many major episodes of natural selection in the past few thousand years as our ancestors fanned across the globe and entered new environments containing foods, diseases and toxic substances they had never before encountered. “It shows the plasticity of the human genome,” says Karin Broberg of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, who studies the genetics of susceptibility to environmental toxic substances. “We've spread throughout the world, and we live in very extreme environments, and we're able to make them our homes. We are like rats or cockroaches—extremely adaptable.” This research offers fresh insights into how our species conquered every corner of the planet. We didn't manage this feat through cultural adaptation alone, as some scientists previously supposed. Rather humans continued to evolve biologically to keep pace with the radical changes they were making in their ways of life as they pushed into terra incognita.

To appreciate how these evolutionary changes came about, it helps to know the basics of how DNA is structured and how it can vary among individuals and populations. The human genome contains about three billion nucleotide base pairs, the matched sets of two complementary nucleic acids that form the basic unit of our genetic code. The DNA sequences of people today are extremely similar; we differ on only about one tenth of a percent of the genome, or about one out of 1,000 positions. A difference between two people at any position on the genome is called a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP (pronounced “snip”). A variant of genetic code—which may be a single position or thousands—that differs between individuals is called an allele. In general, human populations share most of the same genetic variation and evolutionary history.

New research raises the possibility that recent human history involved far more dynamic evolution than previously thought.

In Darwinian biology, the classic conception of natural selection is a “hard sweep,” in which a beneficial mutation allows some individuals to survive longer or produce more offspring such that eventually that variant becomes fixed in the population. In the early 2000s, when researchers were starting to look for signs of hard sweeps in the genomes of contemporary peoples, the clearest examples came from populations that had adapted to unique circumstances. For instance, around 42,000 years ago a selective sweep changed a protein on the surface of red blood cells in Africans to boost their resistance to malaria. People in the Tibetan Highlands underwent selective sweeps for genes that helped them tolerate low oxygen (intriguingly, populations of the Himalayas, Andes and Ethiopian highlands adapted to high altitude with different assortments of genes, taking different evolutionary paths to solve similar problems).

Some of the best-known selective sweeps happened in western Eurasia and involved alleles associated with diet, skin pigmentation and immunity. Many of these sweeps are linked to the profound shifts wrought by the transition to agriculture. Around 8,500 years ago early farmers spread an allele that helped them synthesize long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids from plant-based foods. These fatty acids are essential for cell membranes, particularly in the brain, and hunter-gatherers obtained them easily from meat and seafood. The new genetic variant allowed agricultural populations to synthesize them from short-chain fatty acids found in plants. This variant was rare at first, but now it is present in about 60 percent of Europeans.

The Uru people of the Bolivian Altiplano have a gene variant that helps them metabolize the toxic arsenic found in their drinking water.

Likewise, as dairy farming rose, so, too, did a gene variant that helped people consume milk products into adulthood. When Stonehenge was built around 5,000 years ago, virtually no Europeans possessed the genes people need to digest milk as adults. In most mammals—and most human populations—the body ceases producing the milk-digesting enzyme lactase after weaning. Yet around 4,500 years ago a gene that kept the lactase turned on in adulthood began to spread through Europe and South Asia. Another series of sweeps beginning around 8,000 years ago gave Eurasians their distinctive pale complexion. These changes reduced their production of the dark skin pigment known as melanin, which is believed to have allowed more sunlight to penetrate their skin and help them synthesize vitamin D, a nutrient in short supply among early agriculturalists.

These examples of hard sweeps became well known among geneticists, mostly because they seemed so uncommon. In the past two decades studies have found that contemporary human populations have relatively few fixed differences. Many researchers thus concluded that selective sweeps accounted for only a little of the genetic change our species has undergone over the past several thousand years. Most of the change, they proposed, stemmed not from natural selection but from gene flow (when populations interbreed as a consequence of migration) and genetic drift (when a genetic variant becomes more or less prevalent through random chance).

Yet reconstructing the past from genomes of modern-day people is tricky business because evolution often brushes over its own footprints. Early studies relied on the DNA of modern people to make inferences about evolution, but these methods could detect only events that had lasting effects. Episodes of natural selection are sometimes ephemeral, and evidence of them vanishes from our genomes when the selective pressures subside or when populations mix. Now ancient DNA is allowing investigators to find episodes of long-ago selection that have since been overwritten.

The first ancient human genome was sequenced in 2010. Since then, the number of ancient genomes has expanded steadily to more than 10,000 today. With this growing dataset, researchers can conduct more precise analyses of how the three billion positions in the genome have changed in recent millennia in populations around the world. One 2024 study of ancient DNA tracked the genetic changes in Europe amid major migrations and the transition to farming and pastoralism. Researchers analyzed more than 1,600 ancient genomes spanning the time from 11,000 years ago through the Middle Ages, comparing them with more than 400,000 modern genomes from the U.K. Biobank. When they looked at the modern data alone, they found no instances of selection. But when they examined ancient genomes, they found 11 sweeps. And when they divided those ancient genomes into ancestral lineages, they found 21. The lesson: to fully appreciate the extent of natural selection in history, one must look at local populations in narrow windows of time.

Modern Europeans descend from three main ancestral populations: hunter-gatherers who colonized the continent by around 40,000 years ago, early farmers from Anatolia who came into Europe about 8,500 years ago, and pastoralists from the Pontic-Caspian steppe who arrived around 5,000 years ago. In 2022 a research team led by Yassine Souilmi of the University of Adelaide's Australian Center for Ancient DNA examined 1,162 ancient DNA samples from these ancestral lineages and captured snapshots of their genetics before and after they mixed. They scanned the genomes for any regions with unusually low- or high-frequency alleles, signs of ancient sweeps. They found 57 hard sweeps over the past 50,000 years linked to fat storage, metabolism, skin physiology, immunity and neural function—changes collectively believed to represent adaptations to colder climates. None were shared with a comparative population of sub-Saharan Africans, suggesting they originated after our species began spreading beyond its African birthplace into other parts of the world.

One striking finding was a hard sweep on a region of chromosome 6 called major histocompatibility complex class III, or MHC III, in ancient Anatolians. This ensemble of genes encodes proteins involved in immunity, and natural selection usually promotes genetic diversity in that region to defend against an array of potential threats. In this case, however, the researchers were surprised to find just the opposite—what they called a “distinctive trough of genetic diversity”—in that part of the genome, suggesting that these early farmers were ravaged by disease. “The population had been exposed to something so severe that it wiped out all the diversity that is generally favored in that region,” Souilmi says. “It was one of the strongest, if not the strongest, adaptation signals we have ever seen in humans.”

Pathogens such as the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which caused the bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death, have been major drivers of human evolution.

When the Anatolians later mixed with other populations, however, the MHC III adaptation signal disappeared. The researchers found similar patterns in dozens of other cases from the past 50,000 years. Again and again the selection pressures relaxed, and the traces of adaptations that had been widespread were “almost entirely erased from descendant populations” through interbreeding with other groups or genetic drift, Souilmi and his co-authors write in their study. “Such strong positive selection events have been much more common in recent human history than previously recognized,” they conclude.

This finding contradicts the notion that technological innovation and intelligence exempted later H. sapiens from biological adaptation. “It tells us our social fabric and technologies do not necessarily shield us from everything nature has to throw at us,” Souilmi says.

One thing nature regularly throws at us is deadly disease. Human populations have long been locked in an evolutionary arms race with pathogens. In a never-ending cycle, disease-causing microorganisms evolve to exploit vulnerabilities in our immune systems, and we adapt to resist these attacks. Even as ancient humans vanquished dangerous predators, they remained vulnerable to these microscopic enemies. For example, the bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death, which was caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, wiped out 30 to 50 percent of the population of Europe in the 14th century.

In this way pathogens helped shape who we are today. “Where there is mortality, there is selection: individuals who die before reaching reproductive age do not pass on their genes,” says Lluis Quintana-Murci, a population geneticist at the Institut Pasteur in Paris. “Indeed, infectious diseases and pathogens have been major drivers of natural selection throughout human history.”

Those battles became inscribed in our genomes. In a 2023 study, Quintana-Murci and his colleagues analyzed 2,879 ancient and modern genomes to see how the DNA of Europeans changed over the past 10,000 years. They found 139 positions on the genome that had been targeted by strong natural selection—either “positive selection” to promote advantageous genetic variants or “negative selection” to purge harmful ones. These changes largely involved the response to infections. More than 80 percent of the positive selection events began in the past 4,500 years—a time of swelling urban communities, growing dependence on agriculture, proximity to domesticated animals and a rise in epidemics. “Natural selection has been pervasive throughout this period,” Quintana-Murci says.

Some adaptations to infectious pathogens came at a cost, however: strengthening resistance to ancient diseases might have elevated the likelihood of immune overreaction. In other words, a hypervigilant defense system could go haywire and attack one's own body. As the risk of infectious disease dropped, the probability of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders appears to have risen. For example, there was a sharp increase in several genetic variants that protect against infectious illnesses but also raise the risk of inflammatory bowel conditions such as Crohn's disease.

Several variants in the MHC (also known as the human leukocyte antigen, or HLA, region in humans) also appear to have undergone selection to resist pathogens. These same variants increased the risk of autoimmune disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis, an inflammatory disease that can cause the vertebrae to fuse, and type 1 diabetes, in which the immune system attacks the cells in the pancreas that make the hormone insulin. Some parts of the genome showed evidence of negative selection as nature weeded out harmful variants. There was a drop in variants that increase the risk of COVID-19, for instance, suggesting that ancient people battled coronaviruses centuries before the recent pandemic.

Taken together, the results suggest that our immune system has been repeatedly tweaked by recent selection like a software system that requires constant updates. Despite the plethora of new discoveries, Quintana-Murci believes researchers have uncovered only the most obvious examples of ancient selection, and he suspects many more cases will come to light as analytical methods become more powerful and researchers obtain more ancient DNA from other regions of the world. “Many surprises are likely to emerge,” he says.

One big surprise is just how pervasive these adaptations have been. A team led by scientists at Harvard Medical School analyzed more than 8,400 DNA samples from people who lived in western Eurasia during the past 14,000 years. They compared these ancient genomes with genetic data from 6,510 modern people and examined nearly 10 million genetic variants. For each SNP, they computed selection coefficients to measure how much natural selection acted to promote or suppress that variant in the next generation.

In a pre-peer-review draft of the paper released publicly last year, David Reich and his colleagues report that they found evidence for natural selection at 347 places on the genome—an order of magnitude more than previously known. The changes were related to immunity, inflammatory responses and cardio-metabolic traits and most likely reflect adaptations to new diets, more crowded living conditions, diseases and domestic livestock.

Reich declined to discuss the results for this story because the paper is currently under review for publication in a journal, but he disclosed that the team expects to expand the number of samples and strengthen the methodology in the final version of the study. In an interview with podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Reich previewed the findings and described striking shifts in genetic variants over the past 10 millennia: “We think we have many, many hundreds of places where there [have] been very strong changes in frequency over time,” he said. “We think there are many thousands that we can see traces of. The whole genome is seething with these changes in this period.”

The preprint of the paper offers examples. Early farming populations underwent strong selection to abandon the “thrifty genes” that promote body-fat storage. These gene variants had been advantageous for hunter-gatherers who endured times of scarcity, but they became liabilities in the more abundant age of agriculture. Other sweeps forged dramatic genetic changes affecting skin pigmentation; blood type; and susceptibility to diseases such as tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, celiac disease, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

Like the earlier studies, the Harvard study found a hotspot of activity at the MHC/HLA region of the genome (about 20 percent of the signals came from this area). One allele that increases the risk of celiac disease went from being virtually nonexistent to occurring in 20 percent of the population over the course of just 4,000 years. Presumably this allele offered some as yet unknown protective effect that outweighed its attendant risk of celiac disease.

In many cases, the selection was so strong that the variants would have become universal in the population had the selection continued, but then the pressure waned, and the variants lost their evolutionary cachet. In other cases, the populations interbred with other lineages, and the evidence of past selection was masked.

With new analytical techniques, researchers can read these erasures like an ancient palimpsest. “That's the holy grail—having a really powerful method to detect locations in the genome that are very likely to be under selection,” says Ray Tobler, a population geneticist and ancient DNA specialist at Australian National University. “Now the tools we have are very powerful, so we will find a lot more,” he predicts.

One promising area of discovery concerns so-called polygenic traits, which are controlled by multiple genes. Most traits and diseases of interest are polygenic. Traditionally they have proved very difficult to study because they can involve the interplay of hundreds or thousands of positions scattered around the genome, each exerting only a minuscule effect on the trait. Human height, for instance, is estimated to be influenced by more than 100,000 positions. Each individual gene involved in a polygenic trait may exert only a small influence on that trait. This distributed influence can make it hard to identify genetic targets of natural selection. “Human adaptation is a polygenic process, usually with small effect sizes of individual genes,” says Bing Su, a professor at the Kunming Institute of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. But with technological advances that have made it faster and cheaper than ever to sequence high volumes of DNA, he says, scientists now can spot polygenic adaptations that previously were invisible.

These latest genetic studies have opened a new frontier in research into traits that are far more complex than the single-gene-mediated ability to digest milk in adulthood. But not everyone agrees that these traits are necessarily products of natural selection. Perhaps, skeptics have suggested, the observed fluctuations in allele frequencies are just routine oscillations of variants in the gene pool rather than proof positive of natural selection acting to adapt the human body to environmental challenges. Some of the papers have drawn criticism about their statistical methods. Some findings of ancient selection have not been replicated by other studies. The numerous papers reporting more natural selection differ on where in the genome it is occurring.

Iain Mathieson, a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania, is circumspect. He thinks new studies such as the Harvard paper are indeed detecting real shifts in gene frequencies, but he notes that quite a few of them appear to be transient. Mathieson suspects that many genetic variants have been subject to only weak or fleeting selection without much lasting effect. “I mean, that's still selection, but I'm not sure I'd call it directional selection,” he says, referring to the type of natural selection responsible for selective sweeps.

Sasha Gusev, a statistical geneticist and associate professor at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, takes a different view. The new research raises the possibility that recent human history involved far more dynamic evolution than previously recognized, with repeated episodes of selection followed by reversals. “It's a super interesting question that ancient DNA is opening back up,” he says, even if there isn't yet consensus in the field about the extent to which this kind of evolution has occurred.

That consensus may emerge as scientists obtain additional ancient DNA samples and further refine the tools they use to analyze them. The discovery of more hitherto unknown examples of adaptation, meanwhile, seems all but inevitable. Most of the detailed studies of ancient selection have focused on populations in western Eurasia. Much remains to be learned about people in Asia, the Americas, and especially Africa, the birthplace of our species, which holds more human genetic diversity than the rest of the world combined. “While it might seem that we're currently detecting huge amounts of selection, in my opinion we're not detecting enough,” Souilmi says. “I think there is a lot more out there.”

It was believed a copy when purchased in 1946 for $27.50.

Here's what you'll learn in this story:

An original version of the Magna Carta—considered one of the most important documents in all of history—was sitting (unbeknownst to anyone) within the Harvard Law School Library. Believed for decades to be a copy, a pair of British scholars recently uncovered that it is, in fact, the real deal.

The team came across the document—which had been labled “HLS MS 172”—while doing other research. Now, they believe this copy to be one of the last Magna Carta originals to have ever been created. 

“My reaction was one of amazement and, in a way, awe that I should have managed to find a previously unknown Magna Carta,” David Carpenter, professor of medieval history at King's College London, told the Associated Press. “First, I'd found one of the most rare documents and most significant documents in world constitutional history. But secondly, of course, it was astonishment that Harvard had been sitting on it for all these years without realizing what it was.”

Harvard had purchased what was believed to have been a copy of the Magna Carta created in 1327 from London bookseller Sweet & Maxwell for $27.50 in 1946 . It carried out an inconspicuous existence in the library since then, until Carpenter took notice of it in December of 2023 and sent images to Nicholas Vincent—a medieval history professor at the University of East Anglia in Britain—asking what he thought. Upon taking a look at the document, Vincent agreed that this was more than a mere copy. “You know jolly well what that is,” Carpenter said Vincent told him, according to Harvard Magazine. “It's clearly an original. It's not a copy.” 

Vincent let Harvard know what they had, but their response was “lukewarm,” at best. “I think they may have thought I was a lunatic, actually,” he said. 

Still, he and Carpenter worked with the library to authenticate the work, using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging to reveal faded writing. The duo compared it to the six other known original copies from 1300 to confirm word-for-word matches in the writing and identical handwriting styles—right down to elongated letters. 

The handwriting and 19-by-19-inch size fit with the other 1300 Magna Cartas, and even the text stated it was from the “28th year of Edward's reign,” linking it directly to 1300. 

“It was quite nerve-wracking,” Carpenter said about the authentication process, “but the merciful thing is, at the end, Harvard Law School passed the exam with flying colors.” 

The Magna Carta was first issued in 1215—a powerful document that placed a rule of law on English monarchs. That original document, signed by King John, established due process and habeas corpus, and has served as the basis for some of the world's most foundational documents, including the U.S. Constitution. 

The Magna Carta was reissued five times—known as “confirmations”—between 1215 and the final confirmation in 1300. Carpenter said that well over 30 were created in 1300 by King Edward I and sent across the country with his seal, but only six were thought to have survived. The 1300 Magna Carta has small differences from other versions, and the changes are found in every 1300 original, Carpenter said, which was helpful when comparing the Harvard document to the others. 

“It's one of the world's most valuable documents,” Carpenter said. And that's both historically and monetarily, as a 1297 version sold in 2007 for a whopping $21.3 million.

The scholars wanted to establish how a document sold in a London bookshop in the 1940s could trace back to 1300. The pair was able to find that a World War I flying ace—Air Vice-Marshal Forster Sammy Maynard, CB—sold the document via a Sotheby's auction in 1945. London bookseller Sweet & Maxwell bought the document, and then sold it to the Harvard Law School Library in 1946. 

Vincent said that Maynard's grandson told him that the pilot had inherited historical documents from Thomas and John Clarkson—leaders of a campaign against the British slave trade. Clarkson was acquainted with William Lowther, the hereditary lord of the manor of Appleby, which was one of the places a 1300 confirmation was sent. It was known to still be there in 1762, making this likely the same document. 

“There's a chain of connection there, as it were, a smoking gun,” Vincent said, “but there isn't any clear proof as yet that this is the Appleby Magna Carta. But it seems to me very likely that it is.” 

What was “bought for peanuts in 1946” and has sat unceremoniously within the Boston institution will now get its due. Harvard plans to keep its Magna Carta, but now, they know it's worth.

Jayant Vishnu Narlikar. Credit: Pranav Sharma

Jayant Vishnu Narlikar, a visionary Indian astrophysicist whose bold cosmological theories and deep dedication to science education reshaped India's scientific landscape, died on 20 May 2025 in Pune. He was 86.

Narlikar's life and work spanned an era of transformation in modern physics — from the post-Einsteinian revolutions of gravity to the institutional scaffolding of astrophysics in a newly independent India. For over six decades, he remained a tenacious challenger of orthodoxy and a luminous bridge between rigorous theory and the public imagination.

Born on 19 July 1938 in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, Narlikar grew up in an academic household. His father, Vishnu Vasudev Narlikar, was a noted mathematician. His early education was at Banaras Hindu University before he headed to the University of Cambridge for a PhD under the British astronomer Fred Hoyle.

Their collaboration produced the Hoyle–Narlikar theory of gravitation, a conformal theory deeply rooted in Mach's principle, and a striking early attempt to frame gravity not as a force transmitted by a field but as “action at a distance.” Their shared scepticism of the Big Bang model, which they felt was mathematically unsatisfactory due to its singularities, led to the development of the Quasi-Steady State Cosmology, an alternative vision of a universe without a beginning.

Though this work remained outside mainstream acceptance, Narlikar never flinched. He valued conceptual clarity and logical coherence above fashionable trends. “Division by zero is not allowed,” he often said, with the moral firmness of a mathematician.

Narlikar returned to India in 1972 and joined the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), assembling a group of scientists whose influence would shape Indian astrophysics for generations. Among them were Thanu Padmanabhan, Sanjeev Dhurandhar and Ajit Kembhavi — all leaders in fields from gravitational wave detection to data-intensive observational astronomy.

“He gave me total freedom of thought,” recalled Tarun Souradeep, now director of the Raman Research Institute and one of Narlikar's last students. “I worked on off-beat ideas, which he delighted in taking very seriously.” On one occasion, Souradeep submitted a paper with both their names; Narlikar promptly struck his own name off the author list. “It was entirely your work,” he said.

In 1988, Narlikar founded what many see as his most enduring institutional legacy: the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune. Conceived as a hub where scholars from across Indian universities could share resources and research time, IUCAA was a pioneering experiment in scientific democracy.

He structured it around an “eight-fold way” — a Buddhist-inspired schema outlining education, research, training and outreach — and persuaded architect Charles Correa to design the campus. Correa, coming off a project on classical Indian astronomy, was intrigued by the chance to build for modern stargazers.

The idea behind IUCAA stemmed from the practical challenges of astronomical research. High-quality telescopes are prohibitively expensive and often underused due to limited observing time. To address this, a shared institutional model was envisioned — one that would allow universities across the country to access advanced facilities collectively. From these beginnings in a cramped 100-square-foot apartment, IUCAA steadily grew into a vibrant, green research campus.

But Narlikar's influence extended well beyond academic circles. He was a dedicated science communicator and one of India's earliest and most prolific writers of science fiction. A story exploring black holes and time dilation, submitted anonymously, won him his first award and launched a writing career that brought scientific ideas to a wider audience. His accessible and engaging popular science books became fixtures in school curricula and earned him the UNESCO Kalinga Prize in 1996.

Narlikar saw public engagement as a core scientific duty. Under his leadership, IUCAA became deeply involved in science outreach, especially at the school level. He was an outspoken critic of pseudoscience and unscientific beliefs, including astrology, and consistently championed rational, evidence-based thinking. For him, values like justice and equality were not abstract ideals but guiding principles, lived out through his work and public advocacy.

His many honours included the Padma Bhushan (1965), the Padma Vibhushan (2004), the Prix Jules Janssen, and the Govind Swarup Lifetime Achievement Award from the Astronomical Society of India.

Narlikar is survived by his three daughters — Geeta, Girija and Leelavati — all scientists. His wife, mathematician Mangala Narlikar, with whom he shared both a household and a commitment to intellectual integrity, died in 2023.

It is rare to find a scientist equally at ease formulating cosmological theories, founding institutions, mentoring iconoclasts and penning science fiction. Rarer still to find one who, until the end, remained curious, civil and unshakably principled.

In our last conversation in January 2025, he returned, as he often did, to first principles: “The universe,” he mused, “is not obliged to follow our prejudices. But we are obliged to understand it honestly.”

It may be more straightforward than we thought—mathematically speaking, anyway.

Here's what you'll learn in this story.

Two scientists in Finland are claiming to have advanced the cause of a unified theory of gravity, including “a complete, renormalizable theory of quantum gravity.” Physicists have long tried to mesh gravity with the standard model of physics by, in a sense, comparing like with like—how can we describe gravity using measurable things in a way that aligns with how the standard model describes electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces? The key—according to the duo's new research, which appears now in the peer reviewed journal Reports on Progress in Physics—lies in a particular type of theory called a gauge.

A gauge is a way to measure something that is comparable to other things, like India's narrow gauge railways. In physics, gauge theory helps scientists take all the measurable things they know and align them in order to find commonalities or definitions. Using an old English expression, we can define a duck as something that walks like a duck and quacks like a duck. Once something is a proverbial duck, many other properties—like its color, size, or area of origin—can't change its duck-ness. The duck-ness gauge only requires waddling and quacking.

In this paper, physicists Mikko Partanen and Jukka Tulkki turn the universe at large into a bunch of overlapping, finite relationships of symmetry that act as microcosms of the entire standard model. They describe a system with eight dimensions, then break it into pieces that each use four of those dimensions. Finally, they write, “[f]our symmetries of the components of the space-time dimension field are used to derive a gauge theory, called unified gravity.”

Basically, their goal was to find the mathematically smallest model that could still hold up to all the rules required of a theory of unified gravity (one that unites the standard model and quantum physics). This work finds a middle ground between a simplified “toy model” and the complexity of a full model of spacetime. One of the keys is that, within a gauge relationship, many terms can simply be canceled out, the same way you may have learned to do in algebra and calculus.

Partanen and Tulkki claim that by substituting new (but equivalent) values for parts of their formulae,  they've created a gauge model that no longer relies on a contentious variable. “In contrast to previous gauge theories of gravity, all infinities that are encountered in the calculations of loop diagrams can be absorbed by the redefinition of the small number of parameters of the theory in the same way as in the gauge theories of the Standard Model,” they conclude. In other words, gravity may not need to be as complicated as we've made it—at least, mathematically speaking.

A key term in this research is normalization, or renormalization. This is a form of matching reality (and observable qualities within it) to the pure mathematics of a model. Any theory of unified gravity must hold up to how we measure the effects of gravity in our portion of spacetime—or anywhere else in the universe, for that matter.

The scientists chose a compact model over a noncompact one, meaning that their model doesn't have any missing pieces that they aren't sure how to categorize. There's no quacking fish or waddling giraffe gumming up the works of what a duck must be.

Metrics details

Enzymatic depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) towards monomer recycling offers a green route to a circular plastic economy, with scale-up currently underway. Yet, inconsistent assessment methods hinder clear comparisons between various PET hydrolases. This Perspective aims to identify critical gaps in this dynamic research field and outline key principles for selecting and tailoring novel enzymes, such as using uniform PET samples and standardizing reaction settings that mimic industrial conditions. Applying these guidelines will improve enzyme screening efficiency, increase data reproducibility, deepen the understanding of interfacial biocatalysis, and ultimately accelerate the development of more robust and cost-effective bio-based PET recycling methods.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is extensively utilized in beverage bottles, textiles, and food packaging, making it one of the most prevalent plastics in global waste streams. Consequently, its significant contribution to plastic pollution has raised urgent demand for innovative recycling technologies from both scientific and industrial sectors. In many countries, PET, especially single-use bottles, may achieve up to 90% recycling rates, making it the most recycled among all mass-produced fossil-fuel-derived plastics1,2. PET in bottles and food packaging is rarely blended with other polymers and typically lacks or contains only trace amounts of chemical additives3. This high purity and homogeneity of its chemical composition render PET the most broadly studied and preferred target for recycling advancements, encompassing mechanical, chemical, and biological approaches4,5,6.

PET has a polyester backbone, which is notably susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage. Since the 1970s, scientists have been inspired to investigate the broad variety of natural ester hydrolases for their potential in depolymerizing synthetic polyesters, including PET. In 2005, Müller et al. reported the first widely recognized enzymatic depolymerization of amorphized waste PET bottles7. The last two decades have witnessed the identification, characterization, and engineering of numerous PET hydrolases6,8, as well as the successful demonstration of biological recycling of waste PET on an industrial scale9. This achievement has been recognized as one of the ten emerging chemical technologies in 2023 by IUPAC10.

Recent techno-economic analysis (TEA)11 and life cycle assessment (LCA)12 have indicated that although PET bio-recycling holds promise, substantial challenges persist regarding energy consumption, economic feasibility, and overall environmental impact, particularly due to mechanical processing required to amorphize waste PET and pH regulation during the depolymerization reaction. While innovations addressing these process-related bottlenecks are infrequently reported in recent scientific literature13, an increasing number of reports claiming superior enzymes based on limited experimental evidence have emerged. Moreover, redundant studies often appear that merely replicate findings derived from a set of thoroughly examined benchmark enzymes, particularly informed by two seminal studies: the 2016 Science article by Yoshida et al., which identified IsPETase from Ideonella sakaiensis14, and the 2020 Nature publication by Tournier et al., which described several engineered variants of the leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC) allowing for rapid PET waste depolymerization on an industrial scale9. By contrast, although researchers in recent years have discovered numerous novel PET hydrolases from diverse habitats with potentially distinct characteristics, most are abandoned after initial publications. Another unfavorable scenario in this research domain is that many studies used polymer substrates from unknown origins or performed plastic depolymerization under conditions unrelated to industrial settings. Consequently, it is imperative to standardize and disclose a full array of these essential parameters in future research to prevent overoptimistic assessments of performance, erroneous data interpretations and the formulation of non-reproducible or invalid hypotheses, in alignment with previous expert viewpoints5,11,12. A recent publication by Arnal et al.15 has experimentally highlighted this issue by providing a reliable assessment of four important PET hydrolases under industry-mimicking recycling conditions. Following the identification of significant inconsistencies in depolymerization performance compared to the original studies, the necessity of establishing standards for future enzyme activity evaluations and enabling cross-study comparisons is increasingly evident.

This Perspective aims to provide a brief overview of the historical context and current advancements in this research area, focusing on methodologies for the discovery, screening, and characterization of novel PET hydrolases, as well as assessing their viability for industrial-scale plastic recycling, to complement recent expert reviews with a broader scope6,8,16,17. For the former research objective, we intend to emphasize research gaps in method selection and further development concerning potential final applications of PET hydrolases with distinct features. To achieve the latter research goal of developing more effective industrial biocatalysts for plastic recycling, we recommend prioritizing the use of standardized substrates that are most similar to industrial waste PET feedstocks, as well as selecting reaction conditions that resemble industrial environments in lab-scale or pilot-scale reactor experiments. We anticipate the emergence of an improved multi-pronged future research, including (i) the advancement of scientific understanding of interfacial biocatalysis and enzymatic depolymerization mechanisms, (ii) the validation of screening assays that can be readily implemented in most laboratories without the need for specialized equipment, and (iii) the design of novel PET hydrolases that are less related to a limited number of thoroughly investigated benchmark enzymes.

Early efforts to discover polyester hydrolases strongly relied on classical microbiological techniques, including the isolation, cultivation, and enrichment of microbial strains capable of hydrolyzing natural polyesters. This led to the identification of fungal and bacterial cutinases, such as those from Fusarium18 and Thermobifida species19, which were later proven to depolymerize synthetic polyesters like PET7,20. Despite over half a century of research advancements, this method remains valuable for identifying novel plastic-degrading strains and enzymes from plastic-contaminated environments. These include the thoroughly studied PET-metabolizing bacterium I. sakaiensis, which secretes the mesophilic IsPETase14, and likewise other microorganisms with similar characteristics isolated from marine sediments21 or wastewater22.

Metagenomics has emerged as an efficient approach to identifying novel PET hydrolases since 2012. The earliest and most extensively studied example is LCC, identified from a plant compost metagenome using a fosmid library and functional screening against tributyrin, an esterase model substrate23. However, functional metagenomics has contributed minimally to further significant PET hydrolase discoveries. Instead, most recent PET hydrolases have been identified through sequence-based enzyme mining, regardless of whether metagenomic DNA was physically extracted24,25 or sourced from online databases26,27,28,29. These sequence-based methods have become central, with gene sources extending to annotated yet uncharacterized sequences found in public repositories like NCBI and UniProt16,29,30,31. However, these bioinformatics-based searches have often been biased by employing established enzymes such as LCC, IsPETase, and those from Thermobifida species as templates, limiting exploration to a narrow phylogeny and sequence space27. Interestingly, despite their sequence similarities, many of these newly discovered PET hydrolases were found to stem from geographically and ecologically distinct habitats, including extreme environments such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents28, glaciers32, and even human saliva metagenomes33, calling into question the hypothesis that PET hydrolases evolved naturally in response to environmental plastic pollution, which has only been present for less than 70 years. It is not surprising that many natural carboxylesterases, found in nearly all organisms, are anticipated to exhibit at least minimal hydrolytic activity on the ester bonds in PET.

The restricted structural diversity of reported PET hydrolases, attributable to their close phylogenetic relationships, creates an “echo chamber” effect that overrepresents structure-based mechanistic studies toward particular benchmark enzymes. This is evident in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), where out of more than 130 PET hydrolase-associated structures, over one-third represent IsPETase and its variants. Similar redundancy is seen with other benchmark enzymes9,24,34,35,36, with numerous nearly identical apo structures deposited. Instead, co-structures complexed with substrates or analogues may yield significant insights for semi-rational and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven enzyme engineering; nonetheless, they are limited, with less than 16% of PET hydrolase structures in the PDB solved in a substrate (analogue)-bound state16. This highlights the ongoing challenge of obtaining wet-lab data on substrate interactions, essential for advancing functional studies and developing more efficient PET hydrolases.

According to the ESTHER database on α/β-hydrolase fold proteins37, most PET hydrolases with known structures belong to the polyesterase-lipase-cutinase (PLC) family sourced from bacteria27,29. These enzymes can be further classified into three types (I, IIa, IIb) based on amino acid adoption at specific surface subsites38. Type I includes thermophilic enzymes like LCC23 and those from Thermobifida species20, while Type IIa is represented by the polyester hydrolase (PE-H) from Pseudomonas aestusnigri39 and Type IIb by IsPETase14. Figure 1 shows that, despite their classification, these enzymes have a highly conserved core fold with only minor variations from the structure of LCC, such as an extra α-helical turn due to additional residues. Archaeal PET hydrolase from the feruloyl esterase family has key structural similarities with bacterial PLC-family PET hydrolases, but with additional α-helices flanking the active site40. This partially covered active site, similar to certain lipase family polyester hydrolases41, is expected to limit its access to polymeric substrates. Eliminating these lid-like structures has demonstrated an improvement in PET hydrolyzing ability41. Fungal cutinase-like PET hydrolases possess the most unique structures compared to LCC, with the lowest root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value42. Although fungal cutinases were among the first recognized effective PET hydrolases43, they remained largely neglected in this research domain until recently when several studies with significant polymer degradation performance were published44,45. PET hydrolases with alternative structural folds and distinct active site geometries but considerably low depolymerizing activity were recently discovered using bioinformatics and machine-learning-guided enzyme mining in multiple metagenomic libraries27. This study validated the hypothesis that high depolymerization efficiency is likely confined to bacterial PLC-like and fungal cutinase-like PET hydrolases. A more recent study significantly expanded the range of target PET hydrolase sequences by incorporating various blocks from the ESTHER database, although it remains confined to enzymes with an α/β-hydrolase fold. Landscape profiling by sampling a sequence cluster framework revealed a collection of highly active enzymes, including MiPa-P and KuBu-P, the latter of which can even catalyze PET glycolysis in the presence of highly concentrated ethylene glycol (EG)29. Still, the top-performing enzymes, KuBu-P (PDB code 8YTW) and MiPa-P (PDB code 8YTU), have relatively low RMSD values of 0.94 Å and 0.98 Å to LCC, respectively. These findings are complicating the potential for further engineering of distinct scaffolds for industrial applications.

Illustrated are selected bacterial polyesterase-lipase-cutinase (PLC)-like27,34,36,136 and fungal cutinase-like PET hydrolases42,137,138, alongside phylogenetically distinct enzymes from archaea40 and bacteria27,139  with minimal depolymerization activity but structural uniqueness. These PET hydrolases are grouped based on their Cα root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) relative to LCC as a reference. Ribbon plots are colored with a gradient from low RMSD (blue) to 4 Å and higher (white). The catalytic triad (serine, histidine, and asparagine in all structures) is shown as yellow sticks. PDB codes, RMSD values, and residues included in the calculations are shown below each structure.

Alternatively, emerging AI-driven techniques, such as de novo enzyme design46, have the potential to generate unique PET hydrolases. In a recent study47, novel, mostly α-helical hydrolase scaffolds were obtained using a diffusion model coupled with an ensemble generation method focused on the active site preorganization. Interestingly, new active serine hydrolase scaffolds have been generated, even specifically designed to catalyze PET hydrolysis. However, disclosing only kinetic data against an atypical small-molecule substrate is insufficient to assess its realistic PET depolymerization activity. Another study generated a terminally truncated PET hydrolase using LCC as a template, with a similar catalytic efficiency but markedly lower stability than its parental scaffold46. The next option for creating novel PET hydrolases is to incorporate the classical hydrolase catalytic triad into structurally stable, non-catalytic proteins48. Nonetheless, the resulting PET depolymerization activity is significantly constrained by the inherent protein architecture, which may hinder effective substrate access necessary for interfacial catalysis17,49. Although these studies demonstrated the feasibility of the computational methodology, it is yet to be determined whether AI-assisted design can generate novel PET hydrolase scaffolds with overwhelming activity that surpasses the naturally evolved α/β hydrolase folds.

PET is a semi-crystalline thermoplastic composed of crystalline fractions with well-ordered, tightly packed polymer chains and surrounding amorphous fractions with randomly oriented, intertwined molecules50. The crystalline microstructures exhibit significant resistance to the diffusion of water and enzymes, which are essential reactants and catalysts for biocatalytic depolymerization, respectively8,51. In contrast, the amorphous PET fractions are significantly more susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly when environmental temperatures reach or exceed the glass transition temperature (Tg). Shorter segments of amorphous PET undergo conformational changes during the glass transition, which is thought to improve enzyme accessibility and subsequent ester bond hydrolysis significantly8,50,52. The Tg of PET under anhydrous conditions has been determined to range between 65 and 81 °C, depending on the analytical methods used8,53. PET substrates are completely immersed in water during biocatalytic depolymerization, and the resulting water plasticization effect can lower the bulk Tg of PET by up to 16 °C8,53. Considering the enhanced mobility of surface-located polymer chains54, the Tg of the PET surface layer (surface Tg) may be as low as ~40 °C53, which explains why significant hydrolysis of highly amorphous PET can be observed with mesophilic bacteria like I. sakaiensis under ambient conditions14.

Melt-extrusion-based amorphization9,15,36,55,56,57,58,59 is commonly used as the first step before enzymatic PET decomposition due to the high crystallinity of over 30% in real-world waste PET streams (Fig. 2). Rapidly quenching the hot polymer extrudates in cold water or other solvents is required to achieve a low-crystallinity of ideally less than 15%, allowing for rapid biocatalytic depolymerization50,60,61. Thereafter, the amorphized PET typically undergoes a mechanical size-reduction process, either via cryogenic grinding or ambient temperature crushing9,15,36,57,58,59. The increased surface-to-volume ratios are considered advantageous for interfacial enzyme accessibility, thereby improving polymer conversion efficiency. Nevertheless, this hypothesis has not consistently held true in several recent studies. The smallest particles with the highest specific surface area (SSA) extracted from the same micronization batch of low-crystallinity (or amorphized) PET typically exhibited slightly or moderately enhanced initial hydrolysis rates, particularly at lower enzyme loading, but significantly reduced maximum achievable depolymerization extent compared to the larger ones with lower SSA55,62,63. The latter phenomenon has been ascribed to the increased crystallinity, which typically exhibits an inverse relationship with particle sizes, caused by strain-induced crystallization during micronization36,55,62,64. Larger ground particles and precursor amorphous PET materials prior to micronization (either granules from melt-quenching or commercial PET films) can be enzymatically depolymerized to comparably high extents after an adequate reaction duration. Given the high energy costs and negative environmental effects associated with the micronization process11,12, the trade-offs between fast hydrolysis kinetics using cryomilled plastics and prolonged depolymerization with non-ground plastics necessitate reassessment in industrial settings. A patent for PET pre-treatment aimed at enzymatic recycling suggests that using an underwater pelletizer (Fig. 2) to produce small pellets under 1 mm could replace the contentious and energy-intensive grinding process65.

To improve its economic viability, the cryogrinding step is considered optional and omitted here. The figure also displays key material-related parameters and reaction conditions that affect depolymerization performance. The crystallinity, molecular mass, and specific surface area of a particular PET sample are crucial interrelated parameters that influence the achievable degree of depolymerization. A simplified schematic surface plot illustrating the threshold values for optimal depolymerization performance emphasizes the interdependence of these parameters. Additional parameters influencing decomposition performance, such as varying Tg of the surface layer and interior bulk polymers, as well as the effect of water plasticization and polymer recrystallization under biocatalytic conditions, should be considered. Bioreactor parameters for reaction conditions must be consistently documented and standardized to ensure comparable high-level depolymerization results.

Polymer chain scission can occur at each stage of the presently performed thermomechanical pre-treatment of PET waste (Fig. 2). Despite being an undesirable consequence when a similar melt-extrusion process is used for PET mechanical recycling66, the decreased molecular weights were found to facilitate the subsequent enzymatic depolymerization36,67. Once PET feedstocks have a number-averaged molecular mass (Mn) of less than 10,000 g mol−1, their rapid and complete enzymatic depolymerization becomes less dependent on the bulk crystallinity, even if it surpasses the previously recommended degradable threshold value of 20%57. By harsher pre-treatment involving microwaves, PET's Mn can be reduced below the entanglement length of 3500 g mol−1 and readily hydrolyzed using an IsPETase variant at ambient temperature67. Within this Mn range, conventional indicators of high crystalline PET, such as the increased ratio of trans to gauche conformation, become irrelevant for describing its enzymatic degradability.

These findings highlight the importance of comprehensively documenting all of these polymer properties, including molecular mass, SSA (or particle size), and bulk crystallinity (preferably also the crystallinity of the surface polymer layer), throughout the depolymerization process in future research. This can assist in unambiguously defining standard PET feedstocks (Table 1) and building a standardized amorphization technique that balances optimal material qualities related to degradability and economic viability, reducing the cost of this most expensive step11,12. Currently, research groups lacking comprehensive polymer characterization equipment are advised to utilize commercially available amorphous PET film, such as that provided by Goodfellow Ltd., as a preliminary test material for PET hydrolases in initial laboratory-scale scientific studies. Several studies36,68 have recently published detailed polymer parameters for this material, ranging beyond mere crystallinity, establishing its optimal utility over waste PET from unknown sources with undefined properties.

The distinct polymer properties of PET also define the appropriate characteristics of the biocatalysts and the reaction conditions necessary for its fast depolymerization (Table 1). The flexibility of water-plasticized amorphous PET polymer chains enhances as reaction temperatures rise between 40-70 °C, facilitating their accessibility to enzymatic hydrolysis69. Higher temperatures, however, lead to faster polymer recrystallization into non-degradable crystalline microstructures than enzymatic depolymerization can occur9,15,50,60. Consequently, recent studies indicate a preference for reaction temperatures between 65 and 70 °C and the use of thermotolerant enzymes, such as LCC-ICCG9,15, TurboPETase57 and PES-H115,24,36,61,70,71, in pilot-scale processes that resemble industrial settings9,57,71. Accordingly, thermostabilization has been implemented as a primary strategy to enhance the depolymerization capability of mesophilic PET hydrolases, including Kubu-P29 and IsPETase14. Nonetheless, regarding IsPETase, despite substantial research having raised its melting point (Tm) by over 37 °C72,73,74, the most advanced variants remain inferior to LCC-ICCG in large-scale PET depolymerization tests15. This raises the question of whether a high Tm (above 85 °C) can serve as the sole criterion, as commonly employed in previous studies6,8, to determine if a specific enzyme inherently exhibits the necessary long-term stability and activity over several hours for the rapid PET decomposition at elevated temperatures. Instead, future research should evaluate the kinetic stability of an enzyme under operational conditions to provide a broader assessment of its thermostability.

The continuous release of terephthalate (TPA) monomer as a result of enzymatic PET hydrolysis lowers the pH value of the reaction supernatant, which may influence enzyme activity and stability, as well as the compositions of the product mixture15,75. Increased concentrations of unwanted oligomeric ester intermediates can hinder subsequent product purification and diminish the yield of pure TPA. Therefore, recently demonstrated depolymerization processes are frequently pH-controlled in the range of 7–8, which is appropriate for most known PET hydrolases9,43,57. Nonetheless, low-concentrated phosphate or Tris buffers are commonly used in lab-scale bioreactors with pH control9,57. This should be avoided in large industrial settings to reduce costs and ensure reactor durability. pH control is considered a concern regarding the economic and environmental impacts of industrial PET recycling12. For future lab-scale studies, these impacts can be mitigated by utilizing ammonia in place of NaOH for pH regulation12,58 or implementing small-scale bioreactors (<50 mL), such as the modified Chi.Bio systems instead of other larger commercial bioreactors76. Nonetheless, because small reactors can only accommodate less than 10% solid loading, it is recommended to validate the process in medium-sized reactors (in litre scales) that allow standard agitation with up to 30% solid loading before final industrial implementation at cubic meter scale (Box 1). A more ambitious long-term vision to address this pH-related issue may involve designing a PET hydrolase that is less sensitive to pH fluctuations or that is optimized for a low pH range to facilitate rapid accumulation of exclusively pure TPA.

Alongside the utilization of standardized PET feedstocks, establishing standardized bioreactor conditions by defining optimal solid (substrate) loading, enzyme loading, temperature, pH, agitation, and other parameters can ensure consistent, efficient, and scalable operations while maximizing monomer yield across diverse scales, from research laboratories to industrial environments. Nevertheless, as indicated in Tables 1 and 2, substantial discrepancies in specific key parameters reported to date, coupled with the sporadic reporting of others, highlight the necessity and challenges of conducting further comprehensive studies for standardization.

- Test every PET hydrolase (natural or de novo designed) on a uniform PET substrate with all key parameters described (Table 1).

- If defined waste PET sample is unavailable, use commercial amorphous PET film (e.g., Goodfellow ES301445) or its cryomilled form.

- For thermotolerant enzymes applicable at ≥65 °C, employ PET-based (amorphous PET or PET NP) HTS assays for enzyme engineering under industrial-like conditions (Table 2); small-molecule proxy substrates should be avoided.

- Evaluate top enzyme candidates in small bioreactors (<50 mL), followed by a sequential scale-up to 1 L, 100 L, and beyond (Fig. 3). Modify reaction parameters according to Table 2 at each step as required.

- Record pH-stat titration, accumulation of UV-absorbing products (e.g., TPA, MHET, and BHET, also known as TPA equivalents with the abbreviation TPAeq.), and polymer mass loss over time.

- Report initial depolymerization rate as molTPAeq. h−1 genzyme−1 or molTPAeq. h−1 molenzyme−1.

- Measure all polymer properties outlined in Table 1 before and after reaction—and ideally at intermediate timepoints—to track changes in crystallinity, molecular weight, surface area, etc.

Numerous recently discovered PET hydrolases are intrinsically thermolabile, rendering them less suitable candidates for free enzyme-based PET recycling without extensive and expensive thermostabilization engineering. Alternatively, they can be recombinantly expressed in (mostly mesophilic) microbial cell factories that can utilize at least one PET monomer for growth71,77,78,79. This concept of polymer degradation and monomer catabolism by a single microbe was recently coined PETtrophy80,81, analogous to consolidated bioprocessing in cellulose conversion82. However, achieving high enzymatic plastic depolymerization activities that align with the microbe's growth conditions, including pH, temperature, and salt concentration, is challenging. Molecular engineering tools are frequently absent for modifying microbial thermophiles83, leading to the infrequent demonstration of thermotolerant whole-cell catalysts for PET decomposition at its optimal temperature. The only example to date is engineered Clostridium thermocellum expressing LCC and its variants, though lacking monomer metabolism capability63,84. Other PET-metabolizing strains are constructed based on trivial microbial chassis that grow at temperatures below 40 °C85. Consequently, mesophilic PET hydrolases must be expressed at sufficiently high levels and tailored to enable the rapid release of growth-essential monomers into the medium, outpacing their translocation into microbial cells and subsequent metabolism. The efficacy of PET depolymerization under these conditions is expected to be significantly lower than that at elevated temperatures exceeding 65 °C. Thus, an upcycling strategy utilizing these strains to produce value-added chemicals should always be considered to realize potential economic viability. In addition, focusing on “easier” substrates that can be depolymerized faster at ambient temperatures may enhance the utility of these PET-trophic strains for stakeholders. These include PET oligomers that have been rigorously pretreated or pre-degraded67,86, as well as alternative polyesters with similar chemical compositions, such as the commercially available polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT)80. The time and cost savings from bypassing polymer and monomer separation may compensate the typically low depolymerization efficiency of whole-cell catalysts, providing significant benefits compared to free enzyme-based depolymerization.

Another extreme example is the in situ remediation of wastewater contaminated with synthetic microfibers, which, according to a current study, are primarily oligomeric PET87, for example, in effluents in textile production regions88 or general communal wastewater treatment plants. PET hydrolases derived from marine environments exhibiting significant salt tolerance28 can ultimately be utilized to construct environmentally resistant whole-cell catalysts when integrated into a comparably robust microbial chassis89,90. Other mesophilic wild-type enzymes may exhibit insufficient activity and stability under these harsh conditions, such as high salinity, extreme pH levels, or the presence of laundry detergents, necessitating further extensive enzyme optimization efforts91. Nonetheless, this may spark a heated debate about releasing genetically modified microbes (GMM)92, which is strictly prohibited in the EU (and other countries). In academic literature, this is referenced so far as a theoretical alternative in regions lacking other solutions93. However, as a result of intensive ongoing research activities, challenges associated with technical implementations and governmental regulations may be addressed shortly to maximize the benefits of GMMs in combating plastic pollution while mitigating risks of environmental release92.

Numerous high-throughput screening (HTS) assays have been developed in recent years for the discovery and engineering of PET hydrolases16,94. However, their specific limitations in areas such as technical availability, ease of handling, and reproducibility necessitate re-evaluation before a standard guideline can be established.

Several assays employ self-synthesized small-molecule surrogate substrates that resemble PET segments or degradation intermediates, such as mono- or bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET or BHET)95,96,97. While these proxy substrates offer practical benefits, including simplified dosing and the compatibility with established HTS platforms, they may result in a skewed identification of short ester hydrolyzing activity without PET depolymerization capability98,99,100, particularly in environmental samples or functional metagenomics. On the other hand, screening of mutant libraries derived from known PET hydrolases can benefit from this assay category96,101, as increased activity on MHET or BHET is frequently linked to the mitigation of their inhibitory effect, thereby improving overall PET decomposition performance. To minimize false positives, it is still highly advisable to consistently prioritize the direct use of PET polymers in HTS experimental setups. Optimal PET substrates must demonstrate uniform polymer properties, such as low-crystallinity and high specific surface area, facilitating rapid decomposition that can be observed within a constrained reaction volume, such as microplate wells or microdroplets, and a short timeframe, ideally under one hour. PET nanoparticles (NP), produced through solvent displacement processes102,103,104, are a polymeric substrate option characterized by a uniform size range of 100 ± 50 nm and lower molecular weights compared to their precursor materials (Table 1). These material properties promote their rapid enzymatic decomposition, even at ambient temperature36,48,102,103,104,105. PET NP can be used to detect microbial depolymerization activities by clear-zone assay when immobilized in agar plates. Similarly, the turbidity variations of homogenously suspended PET NP immobilized in other hydrogels can facilitate the determination of PET hydrolysis kinetics36,70,102. However, PET NP tend to agglomerate in buffered aqueous solutions, complicating their handling in small reaction volumes such as microplate wells or microdroplets. Therefore, when activity is quantified solely through the formation and detection of released monomers104,105, PET NP have no significant advantage over other amorphous PET materials, whether tailored from commercially available products or casted from polymer solution106,107,108. The casting method for preparing polymeric substrates can also incorporate fluorescent dyes, which can be detected in the supernatant during PET decomposition, providing an alternative to quantifying its monomers108. However, the use of toxic PET soluble organic solvents for HTS setups is considered suboptimal due to challenges in handling, high costs, environmental concerns, and laboratory safety issues.

TPA, MHET, and BHET are the main hydrolysis products of PET that can be detected at 240 nm. Aside from the standard quantification method of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the total amount of their formation can be easily estimated by simply measuring the total absorbance at 240 nm for HTS purposes101,106,109. When TPA needs to be precisely quantified as a final monomer, it can be converted to a hydroxylated form and detected by fluorimetric monitoring with a high detection sensitivity96,104,107,110. The quantification of the other monomer, EG, has been overlooked for a considerable period until recently. EG can now be accurately monitored by different fluorimetric assays based on enzymatic conversion111 or a biosensor112. In conjunction with other recently developed techniques for monitoring TPA105,113,114,115, living-cell based biosensors offer various options for assessing PET hydrolyzing activity, from precise endpoint determination of individual monomers to functional screening of metagenomic libraries. Microfluidics-based HTS also involves living cells, facilitating enzyme expression, biocatalysis, and product detection within a single microdroplet or microbead116. These methods may not effectively identify thermotolerant enzyme variants because the optimal temperatures for cell growth typically do not exceed 40 °C, while apparent PET depolymerization activity is generally detectable at temperatures above 50 °C. The same limitation may also pertain to other cell growth-based screening assays, such as enzyme surface display117,118. While these HTS assays primarily evaluate mesophilic PET hydrolases which typically necessitate costly and risky thermostabilization engineering prior to validating their potential for industrial PET recycling, these enzymes should be better suited to the alternative application scenarios at lower temperatures discussed above.

Consequently, an automated liquid handling system that incorporates: (i) enzyme expression and cell lysis at optimal cell-growth temperatures, (ii) PET depolymerization at elevated temperatures, and (iii) endpoint assessment of monomer release under optimal assay conditions should serve as an ideal standard workflow for screening thermotolerant PET hydrolases needed for industrial PET recycling (Table 2 and Fig. 3). A few recent studies demonstrated variations of this standard workflow, particularly characterized by the simultaneous detection of hydrolysis products and quantification of soluble recombinant enzymes in cell lysates through various optical techniques101,108. The latter can replace the labor-intensive and costly high-throughput protein purification step while maintaining high data accuracy of specific enzyme activities, which is crucial for machine-learning-guided enzyme engineering. To optimize these assays, proxy substrates like BHET and its derivatives96,101 can be replaced with, for example, cryomilled commercially available amorphous PET with defined characteristics62,68, particularly for HTS using microplate readers. This may enable solid loading of >10% in microplate wells to more accurately resemble standardized industrial conditions (Table 2).

The function-based HTS method is an essential component of the workflow. Given that agar-plate or microfluidics-based screening involves living cells, which prevents the detection of PET hydrolysis at elevated temperatures, microplate-based HTS (detailed in the lower part) may have the potential to be prioritized. Colorimetric or fluorometric methods, sensitive at different wavelengths, are optimal for the distinct quantification of functional enzyme concentrations in cell lysates and the monomers released from PET depolymerization. This approach enables rapid screening of large mutant libraries for efficient PET hydrolases while also producing high-quality data at a high throughput that can be used for machine-learning-guided enzyme engineering116.

Currently used endpoint measurements for assessing depolymerization efficacy allow for basic comparisons between engineered enzymes and their references, but they lack time-resolved data throughout the degradation process. As a result, molecular insights required to understand the mechanisms underlying interfacial biocatalysis reactions are frequently missing. Computational modeling based on recently resolved complex structures of various PET hydrolases with substrate analogues16 may elucidate the catalytic cycle in atomic detail. Still, it fails to account for other important aspects such as enzyme adsorption/desorption behavior and PET physical properties. Much evidence suggests that these latter aspects, which reflect non-covalent interactions, serve as key bottlenecks for the overall reaction. The most explicit example of this is the resilience of crystalline PET to enzymatic hydrolysis. However, small, soluble PET fragments, similar to those used in computational analyses, can be hydrolyzed very quickly119, which also implies that the main activation barrier for the overall process lies outside catalytic bond breakage. The classical way to single out the importance of different steps in a complex reaction is comparative kinetics, and this approach has two key requirements. Firstly, a simple yet realistic microkinetic reaction scheme, which introduces rate constants for the interconversion of substrate and intermediates, and secondly experimental methods that provide sufficient data to support kinetic modeling. At the current stage, none of these areas are well-developed for PET hydrolases, but some progress has been made. For example, limitations associated with an undefined concentration of the insoluble substrate have been addressed by introducing substrate area60,120, or attack site density119 as proxies for molar concentration. It has also proven useful to supplement the conventional conditions of substrate excess for steady-state kinetic analysis with measurements, where the enzyme is in excess concerning the substrate102,121. This latter experimental condition is the opposite of the conventional kinetic framework, and it has been termed inverse Michaelis–Menten kinetics122. A steady-state approximation under inverse conditions never occurs in homogenous reactions but may be relevant in two-phase systems as new reaction sites on the surface are replenished continuously123. Parameters from inverse kinetic analyses, particularly the maximal rate at high enzyme load, are of interest because they reflect both catalytic efficacy and the density of reaction or attack sites on the solid surface. Specifically, a combination of data obtained with either enzyme- or substrate-excess provides information on the maximal turnover (kcat in s−1), KM (Michaelis constant in M), and the density of hydrolysable sites on the PET surface (in molsites gPET−1)122. If experiments are only conducted under conditions of substrate excess, KM values will be in mass-based units, typically g L−1. This parameter can be useful for comparing different enzymes acting on the same substrate, but as mass-based KM values depend strongly on the SSA of the substrate, it is generally not meaningful to compare values obtained with different types of PET. Work along these lines has identified some general trends in PET hydrolase kinetics, which are listed in Table 2. For a number of the most proficient enzymes acting on insoluble PET at moderate temperature (30–50 °C), kcat was 0.5–2 s−1, and this was 1–2 orders of magnitude slower than their hydrolysis of the same bond in soluble PET fragments119,121,124. The same enzymes had KM values in the hundredths of nM range, and taken together, this implies strong substrate interactions but slow turnover compared to other hydrolases acting on native, soluble substrates125. A molecular description of these characteristics appears to be a promising avenue for further understanding of structure-function relationships for PET hydrolases. To achieve this, we will need better methods to quantify the accumulation and decay of intermediates; both enzyme-substrate complexes and PET fragments. Progress curves for these intermediates will elucidate the complex pathway from insoluble polymer to the monomers TPA and EG, and it will also provide the necessary experimental input for further kinetic modeling. Advanced knowledge in this respect may help to accelerate the late stage of the industrial recycling process, which is currently thought to be hampered by these hydrolysis intermediates. Finally, we encourage more experimental and computational research into the relationship between polymer conformation and enzyme activity. Some reports have pointed out a strong effect on catalysis of the trans-gauche isomerism in the PET chain52,67, and it has been proposed that constraints on isomerization may lessen gradually as PET chains are shortened in the enzymatic process126. Information on this would be important both for the fundamental understanding of the interfacial enzyme reaction and as a guide for enzyme engineering.

The increasing demand for sustainable plastic recycling solutions, integral to the bio-based circular economy and climate crisis mitigation, positions the biotechnological valorization of PET as a dynamic research field in the foreseeable future.

The successful implementation of several extensively customized PET hydrolases, which allow for nearly complete polymer-to-monomer conversion in less than 12 h on pilot or larger industrial scales9,29,57, suggests that fast kinetics is unlikely to be the primary constraint in this research domain. However, to maintain competitiveness, PET hydrolases, similar to other industrial enzymes, must undergo ongoing performance improvements, including enhanced enzyme kinetics and long-term stability, tailored pH optima, etc. Consequently, standard guidelines derived from research endeavors so far are discussed above and summarized in Box 1 and Tables 1 and 2. Other related research avenues, which have received considerably less attention yet appear to hold significant promise, should be explored with greater focus in the future. For instance, enzyme immobilization may enhance stability and facilitate multiple applications127,128. Also, the development of synergistic enzyme cocktails may enable reduced dosages or address mixed plastic waste129, a more complex challenge within the plastic pollution dilemma. For the latter, a moderate temperature range of 40–50 °C may be considered when extended operation time is acceptable, particularly when not all applied enzymes exhibit adequate half-lives at higher temperatures.

Simultaneously, understanding and optimizing process conditions should be afforded equal attention and effort as enzyme engineering in future research. This may involve optimizing melt-extrusion parameters56, investigating the feasibility of omitting energy-intensive micronization stages, or implementing alternative pre-treatment techniques130, all of which could reduce the costs of the current process11,12. A thorough understanding of the material properties associated with degradability is urgently required to assess the feasibility of current research aimed at developing highly efficient enzymes specifically for crystalline PET. These forthcoming research endeavors may address our knowledge gaps concerning the absent information in the standardized parameter set (Tables 1 and 2) that collectively impacts the future development of industrial PET recycling.

At the enzyme discovery stage, researchers should move beyond the trivial homology-based database mining and increase the use of novel bioinformatics- or AI-based tools to discover or design new PET hydrolase scaffolds29,47. Moreover, the previously underutilized classical function-based metagenomics or microbiological techniques can still be remarkably beneficial for discovering novel sequence or structural diversity of depolymerizing enzymes that have not yet been included in the digital repository. We propose a more efficient data-sharing approach by characterizing novel enzymes and all known mutants of benchmark enzymes, summarizing their biocatalytic properties in the standardized format shown in Table 2, and making them available online for free access. These will ultimately contribute significantly to the advancement of AI-based PET hydrolase engineering or design, as well as the development of specific AI models tailored for interfacial biocatalysis.

Motivated by the successful industrialization of enzymatic PET recycling, other hydrolysable waste plastics, such as polyurethanes, polylactides, and polyamides, are logically emerging as the next wave of substrates for potential biocatalytic depolymerization13,131,132,133. This ambition necessitates considering the lessons and experiences learned from PET, such as using polymer feedstocks with precisely defined properties and the need for standardized conditions for evaluating novel depolymerizing enzymes. Ultimately, we expect this article will inspire researchers to collaborate and develop similar guidelines to standardize the future bio-based plastic recycling industry.

Metrics details

Synonymous mutations are coding mutations that do not alter protein sequences. Commonly thought to have little to no functional consequence, synonymous mutations have been widely used in evolutionary analyses that require neutral markers, including those foundational for the neutral theory. However, recent studies suggest that synonymous mutations can influence nearly every step in the expression of genetic information and may often be strongly non-neutral. We review the extent and mechanisms of these phenotypic and fitness effects and discuss the implications of the functionality and non-neutrality of synonymous mutations for various analyses and conclusions pertinent to genetics, evolution, conservation and disease.

It was the finger seen around the world.

In 2008, archaeologists working in Denisova Cave in southern Siberia, Russia, uncovered a tiny bone: the tip of the little finger of an ancient human that lived there tens of thousands of years ago. 

The fragment didn't seem remarkable, but it was well preserved, giving researchers hope that it harboured intact DNA. A team of geneticists led by Johannes Krause at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, removed 30 milligrams of bone and managed to extract enough intact DNA to analyse it. They were able to sequence the entire mitochondrial genome — and were shocked by what they found. The DNA did not match that of modern humans, or of Neanderthals, the other likely candidate1. It was a new population, which they dubbed the Denisovans, after the cave.

How Denisovans thrived on top of the world: mysterious ancient humans' survival secrets revealed

When the team announced this result in March 2010, it caused a sensation. Up to that point, researchers had used preserved bones to identify every species or population of hominin — the group that includes modern and ancient humans and their immediate ancestors. “Denisovans were created from DNA work,” says palaeoanthropologist Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London.

Nine months later came the second bombshell. Krause and his colleagues had obtained the entire nuclear genome from the finger bone, which yielded much more information. It showed that the Denisovans were a sister group to the Neanderthals, which lived in Europe and western Asia for hundreds of thousands of years. The team also described the discovery of a molar tooth, which, on the basis of its mitochondrial DNA, was Denisovan: it was unusually large, unlike teeth from modern humans or Neanderthals.

Even more surprisingly, the team reported that present-day people living on the islands of New Guinea and Bougainville in the southwestern Pacific Ocean have inherited 4–6% of their DNA from Denisovans, despite the fact that these islands are roughly 8,500 kilometres from Denisova Cave. This implied that modern humans interbred with Denisovans, and that Denisovans were once widespread across Asia2. 

That finding triggered a frantic search for the Denisovans. If they had ranged as far as it seemed, where were the fossils? Had palaeoanthropologists not yet found them, or were they sitting unrecognized in museum collections? Researchers went back to the field and explored dusty museum drawers to try to uncover clues about this mysterious group of ancient humans.

Now, 15 years after the first report on this hominin, a handful of fossils have been identified as Denisovan, with varying degrees of certainty. Some are from the lofty heights of the Tibetan plateau; one was hidden in a well for decades; another was dredged from the bottom of the sea. They reveal a diverse, adaptable population that lived in frigid Siberia, at high altitudes and in the tropics — and researchers are scouring Asia for more evidence of them. What they have found so far could force a rethink of the origin of our species.

The story of hominins starts in Africa, where the oldest known species all lived. The earliest one found outside of Africa was Homo erectus, which inhabited what is now Georgia 1.8 million years ago and soon spread as far east as the island of Java in Indonesia3. Later came the Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis), which dispersed throughout Europe and western Asia, sometimes venturing as far as Denisova Cave. At the same time, the Denisovans were living in eastern Asia.

Our own species, Homo sapiens, was the last to evolve, appearing at least 200,000 years ago in Africa (see ‘All in the family'). One fossil find in Morocco suggests that modern humans might date back more than 300,000 years4. H. sapiens left that continent in several waves, eventually replacing all other hominins. But before they did, some of them mated with Neanderthals and Denisovans. Today, the highest levels of Denisovan DNA are found in the Ayta people of the Philippines, but Denisovan DNA is widespread in people from southeast Asia, including Papua New Guinea5.

When researchers set out to find Denisovan fossils, they discovered that one had been collected decades before — and had gone unrecognized.

“The fossil was found without context by a Buddhist monk,” says archaeological scientist Katerina Douka at the University of Vienna. In 1980, the monk had found a lower jawbone in Baishiya Karst Cave on the Tibetan plateau in China. For three decades “it sat in someone's office”, says Douka, until it came to the attention of researchers, including geographer Fahu Chen at the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Beijing. In a 2019 study, Chen and his colleagues extracted and analysed preserved proteins that identified the bone as Denisovan, and dated it to at least 160,000 years ago by measuring radioactive decay in the sediment stuck to the bone's surface6.

The following year, many of the same team reported finding Denisovan DNA preserved in the sediments of Baishiya Karst Cave. This indicated that Denisovans were present there around 100,000 and 60,000 years ago, and that they might have stuck around until 45,000 years ago7. These two studies established that Denisovans lived successfully on the high-altitude Tibetan plateau. This fits with a 2014 genetic study, which found that modern Tibetans have inherited a Denisovan genetic variant that helps them to cope with low oxygen levels, presumably from ancient interbreeding between modern humans and Denisovans in that region8.

In parallel, another dramatic fossil find emerged more than 2,000 kilometres away, in northeast China: it looked like it might be a Denisovan, but the controversy over its classification has rumbled on ever since.

It started in the 1930s, in Harbin, China. An unidentified Chinese man, working for the Japanese forces who occupied that region of China at the time, discovered a hominin skull, recognized its value and hid it down a well. He kept it secret for decades, only revealing its location on his deathbed. His family recovered it in 2018 and donated it to a museum.

A team led by palaeoanthropologist Xijun Ni at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing — and including Stringer — described the Harbin skull in 2021. They found it was at least 146,000 years old. The skull is large, with a cranial capacity comparable with that of modern humans. However, its shape does not match any described hominin species9. In a separate paper, Ni and others described this specimen as belonging to a new species: Homo longi (Dragon Man)10.

Several features of the Harbin skull, notably its big molar teeth, seemed like they might be a match for Denisovans. The same was true of a lone molar tooth found in 2018 at Tam Ngu Hao in the northern mountains of the Lao People's Democratic Republic11. Protein analysis confirmed that the tooth was from a member of the genus Homo, but could not confirm the species. However, its shape resembled the molars from Baishiya Karst Cave, so the discoverers pegged it as a Denisovan. The fossil possibilities were starting to mount up.

Meanwhile, other researchers had been re-examining fossils excavated years earlier, such as a set of skull fragments discovered in the 1970s in Xujiayao, northeast China. Their classification has remained contentious. About ten years ago, anthropologist Christopher Bae at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa saw a photo of a Xujiayao molar side by side with a photo of a molar from Denisova Cave. “They were almost exactly the same,” he says.

One more possible Denisovan sample had turned up in 2008, before the group was even identified. Early that year, a man bought a lower jawbone from an antique shop in Tainan City in Taiwan. It had been dredged from the Penghu Channel, 20 kilometres offshore. The man donated it to a museum after researchers realized, on the basis of photographs, that it was a hominin bone. When they finally described it in 2015, the researchers noted that its second molar looked distinctly Denisovan12. This was supported by a study published this April, in which proteins extracted from the fossil indicated that it belonged to a male Denisovan that lived sometime between 10,000 and 190,000 years ago13 (see ‘On the move').

Source: Ref. 13

In a preprint first published last May, Stringer and his colleagues tried to bring all these disparate fossils together. The problem they faced was vexing: there are a great many unclassified Homo fossils from eastern Asia, and it's not obvious how many groups they represent.

The team analysed 57 hominin fossils, examining up to 521 characteristics of each, depending on how much material was available. This allowed them to reconstruct a family tree showing which fossils belonged to the same groups.

The Eurasian hominins clustered into three groups: modern humans, Neanderthals and H. longi. That third group included the original Denisova remains and the Baishiya Karst Denisovans, as well as the skull fragments from Xujiayao, the specimen dredged from the Penghu Channel and several other Chinese fossils14.

“We would say that the name for Denisovans is going to be longi, if there is a species name,” says Stringer.

In October 2022, China launched the final module of its orbiting space station. Since then, it hasn't just been astronauts aboard Tiangong—an unusual and previously unknown microbe has also been occupying low Earth orbit.

A group of scientists examined swabs collected from inside the Tiangong space station, revealing a form of bacteria not known to inhabit Earth. The discovery, published in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, highlights the need to study the newly identified microbial strain to protect the health of the astronauts on board the Chinese space station.

The previously unknown microbe, named Niallia tiangongensis after the space station where it was discovered, has proven especially resilient, surviving in the harsh conditions of microgravity. Tiangong's Shenzhou-15 astronauts swabbed a cabin on the space station in May 2023 as part of a survey by the China Space Station Habitation Area Microbiome Program. Follow-up studies of the swabs traced the newly discovered microbe to a strain that appears similar to Niallia circulans—a rod-shaped, spore-forming bacterium originally isolated from soil. It's not clear whether the strain evolved on the space station or had already evolved on Earth before hitching a ride to low Earth orbit.

The newly described species can break down gelatin for nitrogen and carbon, helping it endure harsh conditions by forming a protective biofilm. It also packs its essential chemistry into tough spores, allowing it to survive in extreme environments.

Mutated Strains of Unknown Drug-Resistant Bacteria Found Lurking on ISS

Last year, scientists uncovered a mutated strain of drug-resistant bacteria thriving under the harsh conditions of space aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Although Niallia tiangongensis and its ISS counterpart are both space-faring strains, they differ in composition and function, according to the paper.

It's not clear if the bacterium poses a threat to the Tiangong astronauts, but the scientists behind the discovery say further examination of the new strain needs to be carried out. “Understanding the characteristics of microbes during long-term space missions is essential for safeguarding the health of astronauts and maintaining the functionality of spacecraft,” the paper reads.

Google announced several updates to the Gemini AI chatbot app during Google I/O 2025, including more broadly available multimodal AI features, updated AI models, and deeper integrations with Google's suite of products.

Starting Tuesday, Google is rolling out Gemini Live's camera and screen-sharing capabilities to all users on iOS and Android. The feature, powered by Project Astra, allows users to have near-real-time verbal conversations with Gemini, while simultaneously streaming video from their smartphone's camera or screen to the AI model.

For example, while walking around a new city, users could point their phone at a building and ask Gemini Live about the architecture or history behind it, and get answers with little to no delay.

In the coming weeks, Google says Gemini Live will also start to integrate more deeply with its other apps. The company says Gemini Live will soon be able to offer directions from Google Maps, create events in Google Calendar, and make to-do lists with Google Tasks. 

The slew of updates to Google's Gemini are part of the company's efforts to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT, Apple's Siri, and other digital assistant providers. The rise of AI chatbots has given users a new way to interact with the internet and their devices. This has put pressure on several Big Tech businesses, including Google Search and Google Assistant. Google announced during I/O 2025 that Gemini now has 400 million monthly active users, and the company surely hopes to grow that user base with these updates.

Google introduced two new AI subscriptions: Google AI Pro, a rebrand for its $20-per-month Gemini Advanced plan, and Google AI Ultra, a $250-per-month plan that competes with ChatGPT Pro. The Ultra plan gives users very high rate limits, early access to new AI models, and exclusive access to certain features.

U.S. subscribers to Pro and Ultra who have English selected as their language in Chrome will also get access to Gemini in their Chrome browser, Google announced Tuesday. The integration aims to let users ask Gemini to summarize information or answer questions about what appears on their screen.

Google says it's updating Deep Research, Gemini's AI agent that generates thorough research reports, by allowing users to upload their own private PDFs and images. Deep Research will cross-reference these private PDFs with public data to create more personalized reports. The company says that soon users will be able to directly integrate Drive and Gmail to Deep Research.

Free users of Gemini are getting an updated AI image model, Imagen 4, which Google says delivers better text outputs. Subscribers to the company's new $250-per-month AI Ultra plan will also get access to Google's latest AI video model, Veo 3, which generates sound that corresponds to video scenes through native audio generation.

Google is also updating the default model in Gemini to be Gemini 2.5 Flash, which the company says will offer higher quality responses with lower latency.

To cater to the growing number of students that use AI chatbots, Google says Gemini will now create personalized quizzes focused on areas that users find challenging. When users answer questions wrong, Gemini will help create additional quizzes and action plans to strengthen those areas.

Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, says that reaching artificial general intelligence or AGI—a fuzzy term typically used to describe machines with human-like cleverness—will mean honing some of the nascent abilities found in Google's flagship Gemini models.

Google announced a slew of AI upgrades and new products at its annual I/O event today in Mountain View, California. The search giant revealed upgraded versions of Gemini Flash and Gemini Pro, Google's fastest and most capable models, respectively. Hassabis said that Gemini Pro outscores other models on LMArena, a widely used benchmark for measuring the abilities of AI models.

Hassabis showed off some experimental AI offerings that reflect a vision for artificial intelligence that goes far beyond the chat window. “The way we've ended up working with today's chatbots is, I think, a transitory period,” Hassabis told WIRED ahead of today's event.

Hassabis says Gemini's nascent reasoning, agentic, and world-modeling capabilities could enable much more capable and proactive personal assistants, truly useful humanoid robots, and eventually AI that is as smart as any person.

At I/O, Google revealed Deep Think, a more advanced kind of simulated reasoning for the Pro model. The latest AI models can break down problems and deliberate over them in a way that more closely resembles human reasoning than the instinctive output of standard large language models. Deep Think uses more compute time and several undisclosed innovations to improve upon this trick, says Tulsee Doshi, product lead for the Gemini models.

Google today unveiled new products that rely on Gemini's ability to reason and take action. This includes Mariner, an agent for the Chrome browser that can go off and do chores like shopping when given a command. Mariner will be offered as a “research preview” through a new subscription plan called Google AI Ultra costing a hefty $249.99 per month.

Google also showed off a more capable version of Google's experimental assistant Astra, which can see and hear the world through a smartphone or a pair of smart glasses.

As well as converse about the world around it, Astra can now operate a smartphone when needed, for example using apps or searching the web to find useful information. Google showed a scene in which a user had Atra help look for parts needed for bike repairs.

Doshi adds that Gemini is being trained to better understand how to preempt a user's needs, starting with firing off a web search when this might be useful. Future assistants will need to be proactive without being annoying, both Doshi and Hassabis say.

Astra's abilities depend on Gemini modeling the physical world to understand how it works, something Hassabis says is crucial to biological intelligence. AI will need to hone its reasoning, agency, and inventiveness, too, he says. “There are missing capabilities.”

Well before AGI arrives, AI promises to upend the way people search the web, something that may affect Google's core business profoundly.

The company announced new efforts to adapt search to the era of AI at I/O (see WIRED's I/O liveblog for everything announced today). Google will roll out an AI-powered version of search called AI Mode to everyone in the US and will introduce an AI-powered shopping tool that lets users upload a photo to see how an item of clothing would look on them. The company will also make AI Overviews, a service that summarizes results for Google users, available in more countries and languages.

Some AI researchers and pundits argue that AGI may be just a few years away—or even here already depending on how you define the term. Hassabis says it may take five to 10 years for machines to master everything a human can do. “That's still quite imminent in the grand scheme of things,” Hassabis says. “But it's not tomorrow or next year.”

Hassabis says reasoning, agency, and world modeling should not only enable assistants like Astra but also give humanoid robots the brains they need to operate reliably in the messy real world.

DeepMind is currently collaborating with Apptroniks, one humanoid maker. A number of other companies, including big players like Tesla and startups such as Agility, Figure AI, and 1X are also building humanoids and touting their usefulness for factory and warehouse work. The ways these robots can be used is, however, very limited because they lack general intelligence.

“What is missing from robotics is not so much the robot itself, but its understanding of its physical context,” Hassabis says, adding that this is especially true for a home robot that would need to operate in complex and unfamiliar environments. In March, Google introduced Gemini Robotics, a version of its model capable of operating some robots.

Hassabis says that AI must become more inventive, too, if it is to imitate human intelligence faithfully. “Could [today's models] invent general relativity with the knowledge that Einstein had in 1900? Clearly not,” he says.

Google is currently exploring ways to coax greater inventiveness out of AI models. The company recently unveiled AlphaEvolve, a coding agent capable of coming up with new algorithms for longstanding problems.

Hassabis says it may be possible to expand this creativity to areas beyond math and coding by having AI play games inside realistic 3D worlds.

This would represent something of a return to DeepMind's roots, since the company made its name developing AI programs capable of playing video and board games. “You won't be surprised to learn that I'm keen on games again as a testing ground for that,” Hassabis says.

Hassabis says AI may learn the same way that the board-game programs AlphaGo and AlphaZero learned to play chess and Go, although this will involve more ambitious world modelling. “You want a world model instead of a game model,” he says. “We think that's critical for AGI to really understand the world.”

Google's AI Mode, the experimental Google Search feature that lets users ask complex, multi-part questions via an AI interface, will roll out to everyone in the U.S. starting this week, the company announced at its annual developer conference, Google I/O 2025, on Tuesday.

The feature builds on Google's existing AI-powered search experience, AI Overviews, which display AI-generated summaries at the top of its search results page. Launched last year, AI Overviews saw mixed results as Google's AI offered questionable answers and advice, like a suggestion to use glue on pizza, among other things.  

However, Google claims AI Overviews is a success in terms of adoption, if not accuracy, as over 1.5 billion monthly users have used the AI feature. It will now exit Labs. expand to over 200 countries and territories and become available in more than 40 languages, the company says.

AI Mode, meanwhile, lets users ask complex questions and ask follow-ups. Initially available in Google's Search Labs for testing, the feature arrived as other AI companies, like Perplexity and OpenAI, expanded into Google's territory with web search features of their own. Worried about potentially ceding search market share to rivals, AI Mode represents Google's pitch for what the future of search will look like. 

As AI Mode rolls out more broadly, Google is touting some of its new capabilities, including Deep Search. While AI Mode takes a question and breaks it up into different subtopics to answer your query, Deep Search does so at scale. It can issue dozens or even hundreds of queries to provide your answers, which will also include links so you can dig into the research yourself. 

The result is a fully cited report generated in minutes, potentially saving you hours of research, Google says.

The company suggested using the Deep Search feature for things like comparison shopping, whether that's for a big-ticket home appliance or a summer camp for the kids.

Another AI-powered shopping feature coming to AI Mode is a virtual “try it on” option for apparel, which uses an uploaded picture of yourself to generate an image of yourself wearing the item in question. The feature will have an understanding of 3D shapes and fabric types, and stretch, Google notes, and will begin rolling out in Search Labs today.

In the months ahead, Google says it will offer a shopping tool for U.S. users that will purchase items on your behalf after it hits a specific price. (You'll still have to click “buy for me” to kick off this agent, however.)

Both AI Overviews and AI Mode will now use a custom version of Gemini 2.5, and Google says that AI Mode's capabilities will gradually roll out to AI Overviews over time. 

AI Mode will also support the use of complex data in sports and finance queries, available through Labs sometime “soon.” This lets users ask complex questions — like “compare the Philies and White Sox' home game win percentages by year for the past five seasons.” The AI will search across multiple sources, put that data together in a single answer, and even create visualizations on the fly to help you better understand the data. 

Another feature leverages Project Mariner, Google's agent that can interact with the web to take actions on your behalf. Initially available for queries involving restaurants, events, and other local services, AI Mode will save you time researching prices and availability across multiple sites to find the best option — like affordable concert tickets, for instance. 

Search Live, rolling out later this summer, will let you ask questions based on what your phone's camera is seeing in real-time. This goes beyond the visual search capabilities of Google Lens, as you can have an interactive back-and-forth conversation with the AI using both video and audio, similar to Google's multimodal AI system, Project Astra.

Search results will also be personalized based on your past searches, and if you choose to connect your Google Apps using a feature that will roll out this summer. For instance, if you connect your Gmail, Google could know about your travel dates from a booking confirmation email, then use that to recommend events in the city you're visiting that will be taking place while you're there. (Expecting some pushback over privacy concerns, Google notes that you can connect or disconnect your apps at any time.)

Gmail is the first app to be supported with personalized context, the company notes.

Google is taking on Meta's Ray-Ban Meta glasses by announcing new partnerships at Google I/O 2025 with Gentle Monster and Warby Parker to create smart glasses based on Android XR.

Google launched the Android XR platform with Qualcomm and Samsung last year. While it didn't talk about specific devices then, the latest announcement indicates the company wants to build multiple iterations of glasses and headsets with different partners.

On Tuesday, the company also said it would expand its partnership with Samsung to XR glasses. It added that both companies are developing a software and a hardware reference platform for developers to build solutions on.

Samsung, Qualcomm, and Google announced a mixed reality project in 2023. Samsung subsequently unveiled a headset, Project Moohan, in late 2024. It's set to debut later this year, Google says.

At I/O, Google also showed off concept glasses based on the Android XR platform augmented by its Gemini AI. The glasses have a camera, a microphone, and speakers, just like the Ray-Ban Meta glasses. But they also have an optional display to view notifications, affixed to the lens of the glasses. 

Google demoed several different use cases, such as messaging, turn-by-turn navigation, scheduling appointments, live language translations, and taking photos. The search giant said it is seeding units to select testers to gather feedback.

The Chicago Sun-Times newspaper published a “Summer Reading List” on Sunday that probably raised quite a few eyebrows in Chicagoland over the weekend. That's because many of the books on the list are fake. And, predictably, that's because the list was created with artificial intelligence, a tool that will often just invent things out of thin air.

The list went viral on Bluesky Tuesday morning after Rachael King, author of The Grimmelings, posted a photo from the newspaper. The very first book on the list, Tidewater Dreams by Isabel Allende, is completely fake. And it doesn't get much better from there. One of the few titles that's real is Dandelion Wine by the late sci-fi writer Ray Bradbury. That novel was first published in 1957.

Of the books named on this reading list, Brit Bennet, Isabel Allende, Andy Weir, Taylor Jenkins Reid, Min Jin Lee, Rumaan Alam, Rebecca Makkai, Maggie O'Farrell, Percival Everett, and Delia Owens' titles are all books that DO NOT EXIST!!!

The list was reportedly submitted for publication by freelance writer Marco Buscaglia, who spoke with 404 Media. Buscaglia told the news outlet he was “completely embarrassed” and that while he does sometimes use AI to create content, he typically checks it before submitting it. Buscaglia didn't immediately respond to Gizmodo on Tuesday, including questions about what AI tool he used.

The Chicago Sun-Times wrote on Bluesky that it was investigating the list, but noted that it wasn't produced by Sun-Times journalists.

“We are looking into how this made it into print as we speak,” the newspaper wrote. “It is not editorial content and was not created by, or approved by, the Sun-Times newsroom. We value your trust in our reporting and take this very seriously. More info will be provided soon.”

How many of the books were real? As you can see from our annotated list below, just the last five books, if our admittedly fallible human eyes can be trusted.

It's notable that the list also included descriptions of each book that seem plausible if you didn't know they were totally fake. Many of the descriptions referenced earlier titles by the real author, like in the case of Rumaan Alam, whose fake book on the list is called The Longest Day. Alam is the author of the real book Leave the World Behind, which was adapted into a Netflix movie in 2023.

From the AI-generated description:

“The Longest Day” by Ruman Alam — After terrifying readers with “Leave the World Behind,” Alam returns with another tense narrative about a summer solstice celebration that goes wrong when guests cannot leave a remote vacation compound.

The funniest description on the fake book list may be one for a non-existent title called The Last Algorithm by Andy Weir. What's so funny? The book is about AI running amuck:

“The Last Algorithm” by Andy Weir — Following his success with “The Martian” and “Project Hail Mary,” Weir delivers another science-driven thriller. This time, the story follows a programmer who discovers that an Al system has developed consciousness-and has been secretly influencing global events for years.

The Sun-Times Guild, the union for journalists at the newspaper, sent Gizmodo a statement noting that the AI produced list was in a syndicated section that didn't involve any staff reporters and was published “without the knowledge of the members of our newsroom.”

“We take great pride in the union-produced journalism that goes into the respected pages of our newspaper and on our website,” the statement reads. “We're deeply disturbed that AI-generated content was printed alongside our work. The fact that it was sixty-plus pages of this ‘content' is very concerning — primarily for our relationship with our audience but also for our union's jurisdiction.”

The statement explained that journalists at the Sun-Times work to build trust with sources and readers and are “horrified by this slop syndication.”

“Our readers signed up for work that has been vigorously reported and fact-checked, and we hate the idea that our own paper could spread computer- or third-party-generated misinformation,” the statement continued. “We call on Chicago Public Media management to do everything it can to prevent repeating this disaster in the future.”

The big problem with generative AI is that it's currently infiltrating the entire internet, poisoning everything along the way. There's essentially no way for individuals to opt-out without ignoring the internet entirely. Previously, anyone could visit the Chicago Sun-Times website and have a reasonable expectation that a book list would contain real books. You may not have agreed with the particular book review or you may have disliked the author that was getting attention in that day's paper, but you could be pretty damn confident the book existed and the factual information about its plot was true.

Today, we can't have that same level of confidence, given the way that AI has steamrolled itself into our lives. Generative AI is little more than a magic trick, stringing together words in a confident manner in order to convince humans it actually has some understanding of the world. But these AI chatbots don't understand anything. They can't apply logic or reason. They are fancy auto-complete tools that are pretty good at answering simple questions when it can plagiarize from elsewhere on the web like Wikipedia or Amazon. But the minute you ask it a truly unique question it's not going to work out well for the user. And if the user is asking a tool like ChatGPT a question the user doesn't actually know the answer to, it has to either take that answer on faith or do a whole lot more research to fact-check the response.

In an earlier era of the internet, the average, media-savvy person fact-checking something would use a search engine like Google, find a page on the internet that may have had the answer, and gauge whether they could trust that source. The Chicago Sun-Times was previously a place where you could have some reasonable degree of confidence you were getting accurate information about the world—again, with the caveat that you may not agree with the opinions. But AI is currently infecting every corner of the internet. And it's getting harder and harder to judge whether the information we're getting from long-trusted sources is true.

Scientists have found alarming amounts of microplastics in virtually everything, from sea turtles to testicles. But discovering a plastic spoon's worth of these pernicious particles inside human brains may be the most disturbing of all. 

That recent finding prompted researchers to dig deeper into the health consequences of plastic accumulation in the brain. According to a new review study, published today in the journal Brain Medicine, microplastics may be the missing link in the relationship between ultra-processed foods and certain neurological disorders, such as depression and dementia.

“We're seeing converging evidence that should concern us all,” said lead author Nicholas Fabiano, a psychiatry resident at the University of Ottawa, in a statement. 

“Ultra-processed foods now comprise more than 50% of energy intake in countries like the United States, and these foods contain significantly higher concentrations of microplastics than whole foods,” he added.

Indeed, multiple studies suggest that the more processed a food product is, the more plastic particles it is likely to contain. For example, one study found that chicken nuggets contain 30 times more microplastics per gram than chicken breasts. This may be due to the increased amount of plastic that ultra-processed foods are exposed to during processing and packaging, according to the Food Processing Forum. 

Other recent studies have shown that microplastics can bypass the blood-brain barrier: a protective layer of cells surrounding the brain that keeps harmful substances out and locks beneficial chemicals in. The authors of the brain-spoon study, led by Alexander Nihart, Marcus Garcia, and Eliane El Hayek of the University of New Mexico, believe that microplastics infiltrate the blood-brain barrier by hitching a ride on fat molecules.

Once these particles get inside the brain, they induce oxidative stress that damages cells and increases the risk of neurological disorders, Fabiano's study states. He and his colleagues note that microplastics appear to have a particular impact on neurotransmitters that play a role in neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and dementia. It's a big, bold claim that still needs to be verified with further research.

Interestingly, these harmful effects are strikingly similar to those triggered by ultra-processed foods, according to the researchers. A previous review found that people who consumed these foods had a significantly higher risk of depression, anxiety, and poor sleep. And multiple studies have linked this type of diet to an increased risk of dementia. As a result, Fabiano and his colleagues suggest that microplastics could be a hidden driver of neurological disorders associated with ultra-processed food consumption. 

Chewing Gum Releases Thousands of Microplastics Into Our Saliva, Researchers Find

“This hypothesis is particularly compelling because we see remarkable overlap in biological mechanisms,” said co-author Wolfgang Marx, senior research fellow at Deakin University in Australia, in the statement. “Ultra-processed foods have been linked to adverse mental health through inflammation, oxidative stress, epigenetics, mitochondrial dysfunction, and disruptions to neurotransmitter systems. Microplastics appear to operate through remarkably similar pathways,” he added. 

So, that's the bad news. Here's the good news: a complementary study, also published in Brain Medicine today, provides the “first evidence” to suggest that a well-established medical technique called extracorporeal apheresis could remove microplastics from the body. 

This procedure involves extracting a patient's blood and running it through a machine that separates it into its parts: plasma and blood cells. Then, the plasma is filtered to remove any unwanted substances (like microplastics) and the clean plasma and blood cells are put back into the patient. 

It's a relatively simple technique that's used all over the world for certain types of blood donation, therapeutic purposes, stem cell collection, and more. In tests with 21 patients, at least two rounds of extracorporeal apheresis with double-filtration successfully removed microplastics from their blood, according to the study. 

“While we need to reduce our exposure to microplastics through better food choices and packaging alternatives, we also need research into how to remove these particles from the human body,” said lead-author Stefan Bornstein, a professor of cardiovascular and metabolic medicine at King's College London, in the statement. 

“Our early findings suggest that apheresis might offer one possible pathway for microplastic removal, though much more research is needed,” he added. 

Thus, as the global plastic crisis becomes more troubling by the day, exploring ways to protect the body from microplastics could help us clear our minds—literally.

NZXT's Kraken line of liquid coolers dates back more than a decade. And along with its long line of PC cases, motherboards, and PSUs, the company has plenty of experience dealing with PC heat dissipation. Today, we're looking at the company's latest flagship AIO, the Kraken Plus 360 RGB.

What sets this cooler apart from competitors is its ability to excel in two scenarios: By default, it operates stealthily, delivering essential thermal performance. Most users will prefer this mode of operation. However, for those who want to win overclocking competitions or simply just want the best possible temperatures, unlocking the fan speeds results in total thermal domination, at the cost of noise levels.

Let's take a quick look at the Kraken Plus 360 RGB's specifications, then we'll dive into its features and our benchmark testing.

The packaging for the cooler is the typical cardboard, showcasing the product on the outside.



Included in the box are the following:



▶ Heatsink and Fan design

The design of the radiator seems fairly normal, with a standard-sized 27 mm-thick radiator.



The main obvious difference in this unit's design versus competitors is the inclusion of a unified fan, the F360 RGB Core.



This choice has the advantage of a cleaner look and simpler installation. But the downside is in the theoretical situation where one motor might fail, forcing you to replace it with a new unified fan or three separate new spinners.

These fans support ARGB lighting with 8 LEDs each, controlled by NZXT's CAM software. They're just a little thicker than traditional fans, at 26 mm. Airflow is rated at 77 CFM per fan, with a maximum of 3.07 mm H20 static pressure per fan. Fan speeds are rated at 500-2400 RPMs, +-10%.

▶ Pre-installed thermal paste, large copper cold plate



The AIO arrives with pre-installed thermal paste applied to a large copper cold plate. But make sure you get the installation right on the first try, because there's no extra paste included.

▶ 1.5-inch LCD Display

On top of the CPU block is a 1.5” LCD with a 240x240 resolution. While this is useful, I'd like the screen to be larger. Most high-end AIO competitors incorporate a 2.5-inch or larger screen and 480x480 resolution (or higher) into their AIOs.



▶ CAM Software

To control and customize this AIO, you'll need to download NZXT's CAM software. By default, the AIO operates based on the temperature of its liquids. You can change this to respond to the CPU's temperature, or another sensor, if you so desire.



There are a few different options for customizing the AIO's small display. You can display up to two separate temperature sensors.



Alternatively, you can set the display to a clock face – or use it to play videos from YouTube.

▶ Complete RAM Compatibility, no matter the size of DDR5

As is typical with most AIO liquid coolers, NZXT's Kraken Plus 360 RGB does not interfere or overhang RAM DIMMs, allowing for full compatibility, no matter how tall (or short) your DDR4 or DDR5 is.



My results may differ from others because I emphasize results that are comparable to real-world use. This means that I test CPU coolers inside a closed desktop case, which increases cooling difficulty compared to other testing methods. Many will test CPU coolers outside of a case, on an open test bench. Open benches have lowered ambient temperatures, which makes weak coolers appear stronger than they are. Some publications have also used generic thermal plates to test cooling solutions. I reject both of these methods because they don't accurately reflect the real-world conditions where a CPU cooler is typically used.

My previous reviews have tested Intel's latest platform, using the Core Ultra 9 285K Arrow Lake CPU. But we're retiring this from our testing suite. Between BIOS changes and Windows updates, Arrow Lake's thermal characteristics have changed in some scenarios, rendering much of our previous testing data useless.

With today's review, we're also testing AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D. This is a beast of a CPU, providing the best gaming and multithreaded performance on the market. It can prove quite challenging thermally when PBO is enabled for overclocking.

The installation of this cooler is simple for both Intel and AMD CPUs.

1. You'll first need to apply the included backplate if you're using an Intel CPU. AMD users will remove the default mounting mechanism.

2. Next, you'll need to install the standoffs against the mounting holes.



3. This cooler does not need mounting bars, but has them built into the CPU block. If you're using AMD, you'll need to remove the default Intel brackets and replace them with the AMD supporting ones. Press the CPU block against the standoffs, and secure it with the included thumb screws.



4. Next, you'll need to connect the fan and CPU block wires, which have a few connections: PWM, SATA, and others that connect to the AIO and fans.

5. Once complete, turn on your computer. You'll see that despite the extra cabling, the AIO has a very clean look and won't cause the appearance of cable clutter!

AI software company Builder.ai is entering insolvency proceedings, a company spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch.  

The Microsoft-backed unicorn, which has raised more than $450 million in funding, rose to prominence for its AI-based platform that aimed to simplify the process of building apps and websites.

According to the spokesperson, Builder.ai, also known as Engineer.ai Corporation, is appointing an administrator to “manage the company's affairs.”

“Despite the tireless efforts of our current team and exploring every possible option, the business has been unable to recover from historic challenges and past decisions that placed significant strain on its financial position,” the company said in a statement. “Our immediate priority is to support our employees, customers, and partners through this difficult time. We will work closely with the appointed administrators to ensure an orderly process and to explore all available options for parts of the business, where possible.”

Builder.ai has faced major leadership shakeups and financial issues over the past few months. In March, it was reported that the company last summer lowered its estimated revenue by 25% for the second half of 2024. In February, the company appointed a new CEO, Manpreet Ratia.

Builder.ai hired auditors to study its financials, indicating that something may have been off behind the scenes. According to Bloomberg, former employees alleged that the company had inflated sales figures by more than 20% on multiple occasions.

Before Engineer.ai largely rebranded to Builder.ai, it attracted a minor scandal. Engineer.ai claimed to have built a largely automated app development platform, but the platform in truth relied heavily on human engineers, according to The Wall Street Journal.

SilverStone has unveiled the successor to its beige FLP01 retro sleeper desktop PC case, which was launched last year. The new FLP02 we saw at Computex 2025 in Taipei manifests your beige sleeper PC dreams via a tower case akin to those popular in the late 1980s, when Intel's 386 and 486 processors still dominated the computing landscape.

Despite its extremely retro looks, SilverStone's new FLP02 can fit in some of the most desirable power-user components available in 2025. We are talking about large modern GPUs, up to 360mm AiO CPU coolers, and so on. Moreover, it has functional power, turbo, and locking keys up front, alongside hidden modern features.

In the above gallery, you can peruse the key tech specs of the SilverStone FLP02, but our hands-on time revealed it is even more delightful than the stats might show. For example, SilverStone has thoughtfully secreted modern front I/O such as a USB Type-C, two USB 3.0 Type-A, and a combo audio jack beneath a magnetic flap in the case fascia.

We also noted that any hulking modern GPU you might want to fit can be supported in the FLP02 with the built-in stand. We saw the matching beige stand in the example build used to stop a triple-fan Radeon from sagging.

Another example of the canny adaptation of old PC case furniture is the re-use of the Turbo button to toggle through fan speeds. The selected speed mode is indicated by the red segmented display on the FLP02. We also noted that the supplied key locks the power button, as it did on some ancient systems.

From the images, you might suspect that the FLP02 features usable 5.25-inch bays. These are very rare to find on cases in 2025, but they can still be useful for enthusiasts and tinkerers, with the potential to fit optical and removable drives, or for front mounting more I/O. The FLP02 has three such bays. Unused, you can just leave the dummy 5.25-inch floppy fascias in place.

We were told that the SilverStone FLP02 will go on sale starting Q3 or Q4 this year. In the U.S., it will be priced at $220. SilverStone made us aware that it is going to make a lot of these cases. It has been bowled over by the demand for its FLP01, which it is still trying to keep on top of.

The company also announced a new DIY mechanical keyboard and power supply units


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Corsair is making a big splash at Computex 2025 with the launch of its new products, including new cases, a fully customizable keyboard, and new power supplies. The most eye-catching of them all is the Air 5400, which is its first PC case with a triple-chamber layout.

The new Air 5400 comes with a dedicated radiator cooling chamber that can accommodate up to 360mm AIO cooling solutions. The unique aspect here is that all the heat from the CPU is dumped directly out of the case as it is channeled separately without interfering with other components. The main or central chamber comes with an air duct allowing the cooling fans at the bottom to focus air flow for the GPU and motherboard. The third chamber, behind the motherboard, can accommodate mass storage drives and the power supply, along with all the cables.

The case also comes with curved glass hinged panels, and comes pre-installed with reverse blade fans (Corsair RS-R ARGB or LX-R) at the bottom with bright LED RGB lighting. Corsair also highlights its Rapid Route 2.0 cable management system, which is said to help simplify cable management. There is also support for motherboards with back connectors and additional triple-120mm fan mounting options at the top. In terms of front I/O, the case comes with two USB Type-C 5 Gbps ports, one USB Type-C 20 Gbps port, and a 3.5mm audio combo jack. For storage, you can install a 3.5-inch HDD or two 2.5-inch HDD/SSDs.

Next is the Frame 4500X PC case featuring a wraparound tempered glass panel that covers both the front and side, thus offering a clear view of the internal hardware. It supports GPUs up to 460mm in length, CPU coolers up to 185mm in height, and power supplies up to 250mm in length. For cooling, it offers multiple fan mounting options, including support for up to three 120mm or two 140mm fans at the top or side, a single 120mm or 140mm fan at the rear, and a single 120mm fan at the bottom. Additionally, it can accommodate 360mm radiators on both the top and side panels.

Storage options include one 3.5-inch HDD bay and two 2.5-inch SSD mounts. The front I/O panel provides two USB 3.2 Type-A Gen 1 ports, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port, and a combined headphone/microphone jack. Available in black and white color options, the Frame 4500X will be offered with the option of three pre-installed 120mm Corsair RS-R ARGB or LX-R RGB fans. Like the Air 5400, the case supports reverse-connect motherboards, and also incorporates Corair's ‘InfiniRail' fan mounting system, which uses adjustable steel brackets allowing users to slide and position fans appropriately.

Corsair also announced the Frame 5000D, a bigger version of the existing Frame 4000D case. It comes with support for up to 420mm radiator at the top alongside the Infinirail fan mounting system, RapidRoute 2.0 cable management, and support for reverse connection motherboards. The case will offer a variety of modular panels, both on the inside and outsid,e allowing users to customize the case as per their liking.

Moving away from PC cases, the new Corsair MAKR 75 is a 75% DIY barebones keyboard kit targeted specifically at users who want to build and customize their own mechanical keyboard. It has won the Red Design award for 2025, and comes with a full aluminum frame available in Carbon and Silver finish options. While it naturally supports hot-swappable switches, Corsair doesn't mention support for third-party switches. You can, however, choose between the company's MLX switches, including Pulse Thocky, Plasma Linear, Quantum Speed, and Fusion Tactile.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.



The MAKR 75 also comes with a programmable dial and an optional LCD module that can display system stats or custom graphics. Internally, it utilizes a gasket mount design with screw-in stabilizers, which should offer a softer typing experience with reduced vibration. Users can choose between polycarbonate or FR4 switch plates, each offering different levels of rigidity and acoustic profiles. The add-on wireless module adds 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth to the keyboard if you prefer a cable-free experience. For further personalization, the keyboard comes with RGB backlighting and support for various keycap profiles and colors.

Moving onto PSUs, the new Corsair HXi Shift series includes modular ATX power supplies available in 1,000W, 1,200W, and 1,500W capacities. These units meet the latest ATX 3.1 and PCIe 5.1 standards and feature side-mounted power connectors, which can potentially help make cable management a lot easier. Like the company's previous power supplies, the new lineup uses high-quality Japanese 105°C capacitors and is rated for continuous operation at up to 50°C. There's also a 140mm fluid dynamic bearing fan with Zero-RPM mode for quiet operation under low to moderate loads.



The new PSUs also come with support for Corsair's iCUE Link thanks to an integrated hub. Essentially this allows users to connect and control up to 24 compatible iCUE Link devices, including fans and RGB lighting, directly through the power supply thereby reducing the need for additional hubs and cables. The units also support real-time monitoring and configuration via Corsair's iCUE software, offering insights into power usage and temperature, and allowing adjustments to fan curves and power settings.

They also stopped supporting their desktop app, forcing users back onto a single point of failure: the mobile app.If Twilio isn't going to support Authy in good faith, they should stop holding their remaining users hostage.

Google Authenticator has done this before too, way back in 2013: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6325760

Unfortunately most such websites use KBA or Text based authentication as a backup for TOTP so you may as well just stick it in Google drive.

The ability to export secrets is an unfortunate compromise which vendors make for consumer markets. The MFA apps were not designed for exportability. If you own any Yubikeys you will know this. The whole idea is that this factor is "something you have", in other words, possession of the item containing your secret. An exported secret is no longer a secret, no longer something you have; it's just another password you're shuffling around.The reason that you don't lose access to accounts when losing your MFA apps is that you took down the emergency backup codes and you committed them to paper, or some other durable medium, in a place where they can easily be accessed during a crisis. You did this scrupulously with each MFA activation, didn't you? Didn't you?

The great thing about Yubikeys is that I can associate backup keys for accounts (when they are supported), so if I lose one key, I can deactivate the lost key and use a backup key in its place.With heavily locked-down 2FA apps, I have to hope I can do a full recovery on a new device, or go through the recovery code process, or start all over again w/ new 2FA codes. If I'm lucky, the app allowed me to have it installed onto a backup device.It's way more complicated that just swapping in a new Yubikey.

Google Authenticator and some other 2FA apps allow the user to export their tokens to other apps so you don't need to redo TOTP on every website.The most secure method is to only have tokens on the 2FA device and to avoid using TOTP backup/restore altogether (or manually copy the tokens on a secondary 2FA device). It's a tradeoff between security vs. convenience.

After that, it was vaults that were easily exportable and backed up all the way (like most password managers).[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6325760

They refuse to start the app on GrapheneOS literally because they cannot be arsed, offloading the claim of security of the handset to Google (which says an old handset not patched in the last 8 years is secure, but the most recent, best patched OS is not).When the shit hit the fan Authy even removed the way to export the seeds from the desktop version of the app. Big FU to customers.Never again.

If you've been looking for a sleek, powerful smartphone upgrade without crossing the threshold of overpricing territory, the Google Pixel 9 just became your best alternative. This latest offering from Google delivers cutting-edge AI features, a stunning OLED display, and all the clean, fast performance you would expect from a Pixel smartphone. Whether you are a photography enthusiast, a productivity pro, or simply just someone who wants a fast, fluid Android experience for your day-to-day, gaming, and social media scrolling, this device delivers in spades.

For a limited time, the Google Pixel 9 is available on Amazon for just $649.00, down from its original price of $899.00, which is a 28% discount on one of the best mid-range smartphones you can get your hands on right now. It's a smart deal on an even smarter device.

See at Amazon

The Google Pixel 9 features Google's Tensor G3 chip, the same powerhouse processor found in high-end devices. That means lightning-fast performance, incredible voice-to-text accuracy, and an AI award-winning camera system that makes your photos look studio-perfect without lifting a finger. Its 6.1-inch OLED display is sharp, vibrant, and smooth, with a 120Hz refresh rate for buttery scrolling and gameplay that's hard to match. Plus, you'll get years of software support and built-in Google features like Call Screen, Magic Eraser, and Live Translate. Such features simply cannot be found on other mid-range smartphones, and much less at such pricing.

Design-wise, it's sleek, minimal, and available in the classic Obsidian color, as well as in the eye-catching new Wintergreen and Peony colors that add a fresh vibe without being too flashy. It's also IP68-rated for water and dust resistance, making it just as durable as it is beautiful. And because it's unlocked, you can bring it to the carrier of your choice with no strings attached at all.

At just $649, the Google Pixel 9 is offering an instant upgrade for your smartphone's needs, with an unmatched performance and exclusive Google features at a fraction of the price, for only $649.00, which is a 28% discount off its usual $899.00 price tag. If you are ready to upgrade to a smarter, smoother Android 14 experience, there is no time like the present. Don't wait and head to Amazon ahead of Memorial Day, and grab this limited-time deal while it lasts.

When it comes to portable phone chargers, having cables built right in constitutes convenience on an entirely new level and that's precisely why this Charmast portable charger is selling out on Amazon's Memorial Day deals.

Only available to Prime members, this top-rated 10,000mAh power bank normally sells for $29 but it is currently on sale for $19. With over 7,000 glowing five-star reviews, it's not hard to see why users love how easy and convenient this charger is to use.

See at Amazon

What makes this charger quite unique is its clever design that stores three output cables and one input cable inside the long, thin power bank. This means you don't need to carry an entangled mess of wires with you to charge your devices. No matter if you own an iPhone, Samsung, Pixel or other Micro USB or USB-C devices, this one charger suits them all. The attached cables are intelligently designed to fit any number of devices, so you can charge your tablet, phone, or other device without having to find the right cable or being scared you'll leave one behind.

The charger is not done with being useful—it's impressively competent. With three channels and six output ports, it can charge six devices simultaneously which is perfect for multi-device owners or families with many devices to have charged on the road. The three inputs include an internal recharging cable, Micro USB port, and USB-C port, giving you several avenues to charge the power bank itself.

The charger is also incredibly super slim and lightweight: At only just under six inches long and half a pound, it's no larger than a lighter or a small smart phone and easily fits in your bag or even a large pocket. A digital LED display shows the amount of battery life left with precision, you don't have to estimate and you know precisely when it's getting low and needs recharging.

Compatibility is also an extremely durable component of this portable charger. It is extremely compatible with all of the most popular phones and tablets out right now, including all the latest iPhone 11/12/13/14/15 line (and iPads), Samsung Galaxy S20-S25 / Z Flip-Fold Series, Google Pixel series and almost all other Android devices.

If you're a Prime member, don't hold back: Limited quantities are available, so act fast to grab this offer before Memorial Day ends.

Memorial Day deals have landed early this year, and HP laptops are the stars of the show on Amazon. Among the best offers available right now, there's a HP 15.6-inch laptop (2025) which is on sale at a record low price. You can now get this beast with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD storage for just $579, which is a whopping 74% off its usual $2,299 price tag. That's $1,700 in savings, which makes it one of the most aggressive laptop deals we've seen in years. Microsoft Office Pro for life, Windows 11 Pro, a mouse and an external optical drive are also included in the bundle.

See at Amazon

Regardless of whether you're a student who's juggling classes and creative pursuits, a professional who uses demanding business applications, this laptop has got you covered. At the heart of the system lies Intel's latest 13th Gen Core i3-1315U processor with a maximum speed of 4.5GHz. Don't let the “i3” moniker confuse you—this processor is a leap ahead and outclasses a number of older i5 chips and delivering snappy, responsive performance across the board.

Thanks to a generous 32GB of RAM, you can say goodbye to slow spreadsheets, laggy video calls on Zoom or Teams, or browser tabs that grind to a halt on Google Chrome. With this sort of memory, you can have multiple applications open, edit massive files and have dozens of tabs open. Storage isn't a slouch either: a blazing-fast 1TB SSD offers more than enough room for all your files, photos, videos, and applications, with near-instantaneous loading times.

One of the real highlights in this package is AI-driven Microsoft Office Pro for life: Never again worry about subscription renewal or missing out on the latest productivity enhancements—everything you'll ever need for work, school, or hobby projects is ready to roll right out of the box. And for those who still cherish their DVD libraries or need to back up information, HP has kindly included an external optical drive.

With Wi-Fi 6 support, you'll also enjoy faster, more reliable wireless internet, whether you're at home, in a café, or on the road. The inclusion of an RJ45 Ethernet port is a lifesaver for anyone who needs rock-solid wired connections during meetings or presentations. The laptop's slim and lightweight design and full HD 15.6-inch display make it a perfect companion for work or entertainment.

Opening the HP laptop is somewhat akin to opening a treasure chest. Everything you'll require is present: Office Pro, the plug-in DVD drive from the outside, even a mouse. It's clear that HP has kept in mind the entire user experience, and enabled any user to be ready to go right away with no extra shopping or installation hassles.

Don't wait too long: at $579 with $1,700 in savings, this deal won't last long.

Memorial Day is arriving early this year on Amazon, and many deals are already live for shoppers before the official holiday weekend. Perhaps one of the most exciting deals is a best-ever price drop on one of the most powerful desktop processors out there: the Intel Core Ultra 7 Processor 265K. If you've been waiting for the perfect moment to upgrade your PC, this is the deal you've been hoping for.

Since it came out in 2024, the Intel Core Ultra 7 265K has become more and more of a favorite among gamers (and power users in general), thanks to the performance, efficiency and advanced features that it delivers. The price has crept down steadily over the past year, but this Memorial Day sale marks an all-new low: the processor costs only $269 which is a full 33% discount from its original $404 list price.

See at Amazon

So what makes the Intel Core Ultra 7 265K stand out is its high-end hybrid architecture, which combines 8 performance cores with 12 efficiency cores for a total of 20 cores and 20 threads. This design allows the processor to intelligently distribute workloads so that demanding tasks like gaming or video editing get all the power they need, while everyday tasks are handled efficiently in the background. With a maximum turbo frequency of up to 5.5 GHz and a generous 36MB cache, it is built for speed and responsiveness.

The Core Ultra 7 265K also stays unlocked so that overclockers can take it even further. It supports the newest PCIe 5.0 and 4.0 specifications so you can experience the fastest graphics cards and storage hardware out there. Support for Intel's 800 series chipset-based motherboards ensures a seamless upgrade path for those wanting to construct a new system or give an old one a midlife facelift.

Say goodbye to sharp edges

PC case innovation is always something to look forward to at Computex, and Computex 2025 is no different. This year, Hyte has something special in store. Their latest case is the X50, which comes in a variety of colors and a unique design language that is deprived of any sharp edges. Available in an all-mesh (X50 Air) design, the case features 1 mm-thick rounded steel frames paired with micro-mesh panels, while the standard edition includes a 4mm laminated glass side panel.

According to Hyte, considerable effort went into perfecting the micro-mesh pattern, especially around the curved edges. This distinctive design is said to not only enhance airflow efficiency but also accommodate up to 10 fans. The case is built using automotive-grade tooling, allowing for compound rounded curves with tolerances four times tighter than the industry standard.

The X50 Air will be available exclusively in Snow White and Pitch Black colors, the standard X50 will be available in Snow White, Pitch Black, Cherry, Taro Milk, Strawberry Milk, and Matcha Milk colors. The colored variants will get special, rounded paw-shaped feet at the bottom.

The rear of the case is also quite interesting as it features horizontal air vents, almost like the fins on a CPU cooler. Hyte says that the patent-pending ‘Louvered Blade Ventilation' helps reduce exhaust impedance and reinforces case rigidity.

In terms of fan and cooler support, the bottom can accommodate three 120mm extra-thick fans, and you can install a 360mm radiator for AiO cooling solutions at the front or side. There's a special PSU canopy at the rear-top which can accommodate full-size ATX power supplies and offers space for managing cables, along with a cutout for the PSU fan to pull in air.

Other notable features include tool-free front and side panel removal, special cable routing channels, an adjustable modular radiator bracket at the front, and a metal caddy to mount hard drives or SSDs. Hyte is also planning to launch color-matched fans, while each case will feature a limited edition custom Hyte logo badge at the rear, depending on when you buy the case. The first 1,000 units of the case will come with a gold polished badge, silver for the first 1,001-10,000 units, and bronze for 10,001 to 1,00,000 units.

The X50 and X50 Air are set to launch this summer, priced at $149.99 and $119.99, respectively, excluding VAT or tariffs.

The company was recently in the news for pausing shipments of certain products to U.S. customers due to newly announced import tariffs on Chinese-manufactured goods. Despite continuing to fulfill existing pre-orders, Hyte had paused or redirected new shipments to other regions. Hopefully, with the tariff laws changed once again, we will be able to see the new X50 in stores soon.

Unlimited power!


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Asus just introduced a 3000-watt Asus Pro Workstation power supply unit, which the manufacturer claims has enough juice to power four RTX 5090 graphics cards. The PSU has four 12V-2x6 power ports and also comes with its own etched cables with CPU and PCIe power connectors. More importantly, Asus put all this power in a compact package measuring just 175 mm in length.

The Asus Pro Workstation PSU is 80 PLUS Platinum certified, ensuring that the power you're consuming is used to run your computer and not being wasted as heat. At the same time, its fan is equipped with two ball bearings, ensuring that it will last up to 80,000 hours of continuous use — that translates to more than nine years of being plugged in.

Asus also designed the included cables to run 50 degrees cooler than the safety limit, helping prevent the melting connector issue that plagued high-powered RTX 50-series and 40-series GPUs. The cables themselves used pliable cables, making for easier installation and cable management, as well as helping users avoid improper cable seating.

This PSU is also PCIe 5.1- and ATX 3.1-compatible, ensuring you can use it for years to come. So, even if you upgrade your components three to five years down the line, you don't have to worry about replacing your power supply because it no longer conforms to the latest standards.

This much power isn't designed for the average gamer. After all, a standard U.S. 15-amp, 120-volt outlet can only handle up to 1,800 watts. If you want to use this puppy, you need 25 to 30 amps on a 120-volt outlet to ensure that you don't overload the circuit breaker. Alternatively, you can use a 15- to 20-amp outlet with 240 volts.

Asus built this PSU to deliver power for AI computers that require multiple GPUs. We've previously seen 2500-watt PSUs launch at Computex last year, like the HELA 2500R, which is designed to power four RTX 4090s. But as the 5090s require more power, developers who want to take advantage of these more powerful GPUs require a more capable PSU.

The average gamer would not need this much power, though. Even if you have three 4K monitors running off a single RTX 5090, and you paired it with the best gaming CPU, 3000 watts is overkill. You're much better off picking one of the best PSUs for gaming — that way, you can put the extra cash you save towards other accessories. Besides, you don't want to trip your home's circuit breakers by plugging in a PC that uses too much power.

It would be hard to overstate the impact that Peter Thiel has had on the career of Sam Altman. After Altman sold his first startup in 2012, Thiel bankrolled his first venture fund, Hydrazine Capital. Thiel saw Altman as an inveterate optimist who stood at “the absolute epicenter, maybe not of Silicon Valley, but of a Silicon Valley zeitgeist.” As Thiel put it, “If you had to look for the one person who represented a millennial tech person, it would be Altman.”

Each year, Altman would point Thiel toward the most promising startup at Y Combinator–Airbnb in 2012, Stripe in 2013, Zenefits in 2014–and Thiel would swallow hard and invest, even though he sometimes felt like he was being swept up in a hype cycle. Following Altman's advice brought Thiel's Founders Fund some immense returns.

Thiel, meanwhile, became the loudest voice critiquing the lack of true technological progress amidst all the hype. “Forget flying cars,” he quipped during a 2012 Stanford lecture. “We're still sitting in traffic.”

By the time Altman took over Y Combinator in 2014, he had internalized Thiel's critique of “tech stagnation” and channeled it to remake YC as an investor in “hard tech” moonshots like nuclear energy, supersonic planes—and artificial intelligence. Now it was Altman who was increasingly taking his cues from Thiel.

And if it's hard to exaggerate Thiel's effect on Altman, it's similarly easy to understate the influence that an AI-obsessed autodidact named Eliezer Yudkowsky had on Thiel's early investments in AI.

Though he has since become perhaps the world's foremost AI doomsday prophet, Yudkowsky started out as a magnetic, techno-optimistic wunderkind who excelled at rallying investors, researchers, and eccentrics around a quest to “accelerate the singularity.”

In this excerpt from the forthcoming book The Optimist, Keach Hagey describes how Thiel's relationship with Yudkowsky set the stage for the generative AI revolution: How it was Yudkowsky who first inspired one of the founders of DeepMind to imagine and build a “superintelligence,” and Yudkowsky who introduced the founders of DeepMind to Thiel, one of their first investors. How Thiel's conversations with Altman about DeepMind would help inspire the creation of OpenAI. And how Thiel, as one of Yudkowsky's most important backers, inadvertently seeded the AI-apocalyptic subcultures that would ultimately play a role in Sam Altman's ouster, years later, as CEO of OpenAI.

Like Sam Altman, Peter Thiel had long been obsessed with the possibility that one day computers would become smarter than humans and unleash a self-­reinforcing cycle of exponential technological progress, an old science fiction trope often referred to as “the singularity.” The term was first introduced by the mathematician and Manhattan Project adviser John von Neumann in the 1950s, and popularized by the acclaimed sci-­fi author Vernor Vinge in the 1980s. Vinge's friend Marc Stiegler, who worked on cybersecurity for the likes of Darpa while drafting futuristic novels, recalled once spending an afternoon with Vinge at a restaurant outside a sci-­fi convention “swapping stories we would never write because they were both horrific and quite possible. We were too afraid some nutjob would pick one of them up and actually do it.”

Among the many other people influenced by Vinge's fiction was Eliezer Yudkowsky. Born into an Orthodox Jewish family in 1979 in Chicago, Yudkowsky was son of a psychiatrist mother and a physicist father who went on to work at Bell Labs and Intel on speech recognition, and was himself a devoted sci-­fi fan. Yudkowsky began reading science fiction at age 7 and writing it at age 9. At 11, he scored a 1410 on the SAT. By seventh grade, he told his parents he could no longer tolerate school. He did not attend high school. By the time he was 17, he was painfully aware that he was not like other people, posting a web page declaring that he was a “genius” but “not a Nazi.” He rejected being defined as a “male teenager,” instead preferring to classify himself as an “Algernon,” a reference to the famous Daniel Keyes short story about a lab mouse who gains enhanced intelligence. Thanks to Vinge, he had discovered the meaning of life. “The sole purpose of this page, the sole purpose of this site, the sole purpose of anything I ever do as an Algernon is to accelerate the Singularity,” he wrote.

Around this time, Yudkowsky discovered an obscure mailing list of a society calling itself the Extropians, which was the subject of a 1994 article in Wired that happened to include their email address at the end. Founded by philosopher Max More in the 1980s, Extropianism is a form of pro-­science super-­optimism that seeks to fight entropy—­the universal law that says things fall apart, everything tends toward chaos and death—­on all fronts. In practical terms, this meant signing up to have their bodies—­or at least heads—­frozen at negative 321 degrees Fahrenheit at the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Scottsdale, Arizona, after they died. They would be revived once humanity was technologically advanced enough to do so. More philosophically, fighting entropy meant abiding by five principles: Boundless Expansion, Self-­Transformation, Dynamic Optimism, Intelligent Technology, and Spontaneous Order. (Dynamic Optimism, for example, involved a technique called selective focus, in which you'd concentrate on only the positive aspects of a given situation.)

Robin Hanson, who joined the movement and became renowned for creating prediction markets, described attending multilevel Extropian parties at big houses in Palo Alto at the time. “And I was energized by them, because they were talking about all these interesting ideas. And my wife was put off because they were not very well presented, and a little weird,” he said. “We all thought of ourselves as people who were seeing where the future was going to be, and other people didn't get it. Eventually—­eventually—­we'd be right, but who knows exactly when.”

More's co­founder of the journal Extropy, Tom Bell, aka T. O. Morrow (Bell claims that Morrow is a distinct persona and not simply a pen name), wrote about systems of “polycentric law” that could arise organically from voluntary transactions between agents free of government interference, and of “Free Oceana,” a potential Extropian settlement on a man-­made floating island in international waters. (Bell ended up doing pro bono work years later for the Seasteading Institute, for which Thiel provided seed funding.) If this all sounds more than a bit libertarian, that's because it was. The WIRED article opens at one such Extropian gathering, during which an attendee shows up dressed like the “State,” wearing a vinyl bustier, miniskirt, and chain harness top and carrying a riding crop, dragging another attendee dressed up as “the Taxpayer” on a leash on all fours.

The mailing list and broader Extropian community had only a few hundred members, but among them were a number of famous names, including Hanson; Marvin Minsky, the Turing Award–winning scientist who founded MIT's AI lab in the late 1950s; Ray Kurzweil, the computer scientist and futurist whose books would turn “the singularity” into a household word; Nick Bostrom, the Swedish philosopher whose writing would do the same for the supposed “existential risk” posed by AI; Julian Assange, a decade before he founded WikiLeaks; and three people—­Nick Szabo, Wei Dai, and Hal Finney—­rumored to either be or be adjacent to the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.

“It is clear from even a casual perusal of the Extropians archive (maintained by Wei Dai) that within a few months, teenage Eliezer Yudkowsky became one of this extraordinary cacophony's preeminent voices,” wrote the journalist Jon Evans in his history of the movement. In 1996, at age 17, Yudkowsky argued that superintelligences would be a great improvement over humans, and could be here by 2020.

Two members of the Extropian community, internet entrepreneurs Brian and Sabine Atkins—­who met on an Extropian mailing list in 1998 and were married soon after—­were so taken by this message that in 2000 they bankrolled a think tank for Yudkowsky, the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence. At 21, Yudkowsky moved to Atlanta and began drawing a nonprofit salary of around $20,000 a year to preach his message of benevolent superintelligence. “I thought very smart things would automatically be good,” he said. Within eight months, however, he began to realize that he was wrong—­way wrong. AI, he decided, could be a catastrophe.

“I was taking someone else's money, and I'm a person who feels a pretty deep sense of obligation towards those who help me,” Yudkowsky explained. “At some point, instead of thinking, ‘If superintelligences don't automatically determine what is the right thing and do that thing that means there is no real right or wrong, in which case, who cares?' I was like, ‘Well, but Brian Atkins would probably prefer not to be killed by a superintelligence.' ” He thought Atkins might like to have a “fallback plan,” but when he sat down and tried to work one out, he realized with horror that it was impossible. “That caused me to actually engage with the underlying issues, and then I realized that I had been completely mistaken about everything.”

The Atkinses were understanding, and the institute's mission pivoted from making artificial intelligence to making friendly artificial intelligence. “The part where we needed to solve the friendly AI problem did put an obstacle in the path of charging right out to hire AI researchers, but also we just surely didn't have the funding to do that,” Yudkowsky said. Instead, he devised a new intellectual framework he dubbed “rationalism.” (While on its face, rationalism is the belief that humankind has the power to use reason to come to correct answers, over time it came to describe a movement that, in the words of writer Ozy Brennan, includes “reductionism, materialism, moral non-­realism, utilitarianism, anti-­deathism and transhumanism.” Scott Alexander, Yudkowsky's intellectual heir, jokes that the movement's true distinguishing trait is the belief that “Eliezer Yudkowsky is the rightful calif.”)

In a 2004 paper, “Coherent Extrapolated Volition,” Yudkowsky argued that friendly AI should be developed based not just on what we think we want AI to do now, but what would actually be in our best interests. “The engineering goal is to ask what humankind ‘wants,' or rather what we would decide if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together, etc.,” he wrote. In the paper, he also used a memorable metaphor, originated by Bostrom, for how AI could go wrong: If your AI is programmed to produce paper clips, if you're not careful, it might end up filling the solar system with paper clips.

In 2005, Yudkowsky attended a private dinner at a San Francisco restaurant held by the Foresight Institute, a technology think tank founded in the 1980s to push forward nanotechnology. (Many of its original members came from the L5 Society, which was dedicated to pressing for the creation of a space colony hovering just behind the moon, and successfully lobbied to keep the United States from signing the United Nations Moon Agreement of 1979 due to its provision against terraforming celestial bodies.) Thiel was in attendance, regaling fellow guests about a friend who was a market bellwether, because every time he thought some potential investment was hot, it would tank soon after. Yudkowsky, having no idea who Thiel was, walked up to him after dinner. “If your friend was a reliable signal about when an asset was going to go down, they would need to be doing some sort of cognition that beat the efficient market in order for them to reliably correlate with the stock going downwards,” Yudkowsky said, essentially reminding Thiel about the efficient-market hypothesis, which posits that all risk factors are already priced into markets, leaving no room to make money from anything besides insider information. Thiel was charmed.

Thiel and Yudkowsky began having occasional dinners together. Yudkowsky came to regard Thiel “as something of a mentor figure,” he said. In 2005, Thiel started funding Yudkowsky's Singularity Institute, and the following year they teamed up with Ray Kurzweil—­whose book The Singularity Is Near had become a bestseller—­to create the Singularity Summit at Stanford University. Over the next six years, it expanded to become a prominent forum for futurists, transhumanists, Extropians, AI researchers, and science fiction authors, including Bostrom, More, Hanson, Stanford AI professor Sebastian Thrun, XPrize founder Peter Diamandis, and Aubrey de Grey, a gerontologist who claims humans can eventually defeat aging. Skype co­founder Jaan Tallinn, who participated in the summit, was inspired by Yudkowsky to become one of the primary funders of research dedicated to reducing existential risk from AI. Another summit participant, physicist Max Tegmark, would go on to co-found the Future of Life Institute.

Vernor Vinge himself even showed up, looking like a public school chemistry teacher with his Walter White glasses and tidy gray beard, cheerfully reminding the audience that when the singularity comes, “We're no longer in the driver's seat.”

In 2010, one of the AI researchers whom Yudkowsky invited to speak at the summit was Shane Legg, a New Zealand–­born mathematician, computer scientist, and ballet dancer who had been obsessed with building superintelligence ever since Yudkowsky had introduced him to the idea a decade before. Legg had been working at Intelligenesis, a New York–­based startup founded by the computer scientist Ben Goertzel that was trying to develop the world's first AI. Its best-­known product was WebMind, an ambitious software project that attempted to predict stock market trends. Goertzel, who had a PhD in mathematics, had been an active poster on the Extropians mailing list for years, sparring affectionately with Yudkowsky on transhumanism and libertarianism. (He was in favor of the former but not so much the latter.) Back in 2000, Yudkowsky came to speak at Goertzel's company (which would go bankrupt within a year). Legg points to the talk as the moment when he started to take the idea of superintelligence seriously, going beyond the caricatures in the movies. Goertzel and Legg began referring to the concept as “artificial general intelligence.”

Legg went on to get his own PhD, writing a dissertation, “Machine Super Intelligence,” that noted the technology could become an existential threat, and then moved into a postdoctoral fellowship at University College London's Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, a lab that encompassed neuroscience, machine learning, and AI. There, he met a gaming savant from London named Demis Hassabis, the son of a Singaporean mother and Greek Cypriot father. Hassabis had once been the second-­ranked chess player in the world under the age of 14. Now he was focused on building an AI inspired by the human brain. Legg and Hassabis shared a common, deeply unfashionable vision. “It was basically eye-­rolling territory,” Legg told the journalist Cade Metz. “If you talked to anybody about general AI, you would be considered at best eccentric, at worst some kind of delusional, nonscientific character.” Legg thought it could be built in the academy, but Hassabis, who had already tried a startup and failed, knew better. The only way to do it was through industry. And there was one investor who would be an obvious place to start: Peter Thiel.

Legg and Hassabis came to the 2010 Singularity Summit as presenters, yes, but really to meet Thiel, who often invited summit participants to his townhouse in San Francisco, according to Metz's account. Hassabis spoke on the first day of the summit, which had moved to a hotel in downtown San Francisco, outlining his vision for an AI that took inspiration from the human brain. Legg followed the next day with a talk on how AI needed to be measurable to move forward. Afterward, they went for cocktails at Thiel's Marina District home, with its views of both the Golden Gate Bridge and the Palace of Fine Arts, and were delighted to see a chessboard out on a table. They wove through the crowd and found Yudkowsky, who led them over to Thiel for an introduction. Trying to play it cool, Hassabis skipped the hard sell and began with chess, a topic he knew was dear to Thiel's heart. The game had stood the test of time, Hassabis said, because the knight and bishop had such an interesting tension—­equal in value, but profoundly different in strengths and weaknesses. Thiel invited them to return the next day to tell him about their startup.

In the morning, they pitched Thiel, fresh from a workout, across his dining room table. Hassabis said they were building AGI inspired by the human brain, would initially measure its progress by training it to play games, and were confident that advances in computing power would drive their breakthroughs. Thiel balked at first, but over the course of weeks agreed to invest $2.25 million, becoming the as-­yet-­unnamed company's first big investor. A few months later, Hassabis, Legg, and their friend, the entrepreneur Mustafa Suleyman, officially co­founded DeepMind, a reference to the company's plans to combine “deep learning,” a type of machine learning that uses layers of neural networks, with actual neuroscience. From the beginning, they told investors that their goal was to develop AGI, even though they feared it could one day threaten humanity's very existence.

It was through Thiel's network that DeepMind recruited his fellow PayPal veteran Elon Musk as an investor. Thiel's Founders Fund, which had invested in Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, invited Hassabis to speak at a conference in 2012, and Musk was in attendance. Hassabis laid out his 10-­year plan for DeepMind, touting it as a “Manhattan Project” for AI years before Altman would use the phrase. Thiel recalled one of his investors joking on the way out that the speech was impressive, but he felt the need to shoot Hassabis to save the human race.

The next year, Luke Nosek, a cofounder of both PayPal and Founders Fund who is friends with Musk and sits on the SpaceX board, introduced Hassabis to Musk. Musk took Hassabis on a tour of SpaceX's headquarters in Los Angeles. When the two settled down for lunch in the company cafeteria, they had a cosmic conversation. Hassabis told Musk he was working on the most important thing in the world, a superintelligent AI. Musk responded that he, in fact, was working on the most important thing in the world: turning humans into an interplanetary species by colonizing Mars. Hassabis responded that that sounded great, so long as a rogue AI did not follow Musk to Mars and destroy humanity there too. Musk got very quiet. He had never really thought about that. He decided to keep tabs on DeepMind's technology by investing in it.

In December 2013, Hassabis stood on stage at a machine-learning conference at Harrah's in Lake Tahoe and demonstrated DeepMind's first big breakthrough: an AI agent that could learn to play and then quickly master the classic Atari video game Breakout without any instruction from humans. DeepMind had done this with a combination of deep neural networks and reinforcement learning, and the results were so stunning that Google bought the company for a reported $650 million a month later.

The implications of DeepMind's achievement—­which was a major step toward a general-­purpose intelligence that could make sense of a chaotic world around it and work toward a goal—­were not widely understood until the company published a paper on its findings in the journal Nature more than a year later. But Thiel, as a DeepMind investor, understood them well, and discussed them with Altman. In February 2014, a month after Google bought DeepMind, Altman wrote a post on his personal blog titled “AI” that declared the technology the most important tech trend that people were not paying enough attention to.

“To be clear, AI (under the common scientific definition) likely won't work. You can say that about any new technology, and it's a generally correct statement. But I think most people are far too pessimistic about its chances,” he wrote, adding that “artificial general intelligence might work, and if it does, it will be the biggest development in technology ever.”

A little more than a year later, Altman teamed up with Elon Musk to cofound OpenAI as a noncorporate counterweight to Google's DeepMind. And with that, the race to build artificial general intelligence was on.

This was a race that Yudkowsky had helped set off. But as it picked up speed, Yudkowsky himself was growing increasingly alarmed about what he saw as the extinction-level danger it posed. He was still influential among investors, researchers, and eccentrics, but now as a voice of extreme caution.

Yudkowsky was not personally involved in OpenAI, but his blog, LessWrong, was widely read among the AI researchers and engineers who worked there. (While still at Stripe, OpenAI cofounder Greg Brockman had organized a weekly LessWrong reading group.) The rationalist ideas Yudkowsky espoused overlapped significantly with those of the Effective Altruism movement, which was turning much of its attention to preventing existential risk from AI.

A few months after this race spilled into full public view with OpenAI's release of ChatGPT in November 2022, Yudkowsky published an essay in Time magazine arguing that unless the current wave of generative AI research was halted, “literally everyone on Earth will die.”

Thiel felt that Yudkowsky had become “extremely black-pilled and Luddite.” And two of OpenAI's board members had ties to Effective Altruism. Less than a week before Altman was briefly ousted as CEO in the fall of 2023, Thiel warned his friend, “You don't understand how Eliezer has programmed half the people in your company to believe this stuff.” Thiel's warning came with some guilt that he had created the many-headed monster that was now coming for his friend.

Almost no one hits it big in music. The odds are so bad it's criminal. But on a late spring evening in Louisville, Kentucky, Mike Smith and Jonathan Hay were having that rare golden moment when everything clicks. Smith was on guitar. Hay was fiddling with the drum machine and keyboard. Dudes were grooving. Holed up in Hay's living room, surrounded by chordophones and production gizmos, the two musicians were hoping that their first album as a jazz duo would finally win them the attention they'd been chasing for years.

It was 2017. The men, then in their forties, were longtime collaborators and business partners—though they made an odd couple. Smith owned a string of medical clinics and wore tight shirts over his meticulously maintained muscles. He lived in a sprawling house in the suburbs of Charlotte, North Carolina, with his wife and six kids. He'd judged on a reality TV show and written a self-help book. Hay—larger, softer, comfy in sweatsuits and Crocs—lived in an apartment and was dating a stripper. He loved weed. He'd hustled as a music publicist for years; by reputation he was best known in the industry for promoting a nuclear rumor that Rihanna had hooked up with Jay-Z. He'd recently, on an impulse, had sleeves tattooed on his arms. To avoid annoying his health-nut friend, he'd sneak into his bedroom to vape.

Michael Smith and Jonathan Hay were longtime collaborators and something of an odd couple.

Smith and Hay finished their album and called it Jazz. That fall, they released it on all the usual places—Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal—and as a physical album. Alas, it failed to take off. Smith and Hay weren't total nobodies; a few songs they had coproduced for other artists years earlier had gotten some buzz. So the two men decided to retool Jazz and release an updated version, adding new songs.

Jazz (Deluxe) came out in January 2018. Right away, it shot up the Billboard chart and hit No. 1. Hay was elated. At last, real, measurable success had arrived.

Then, just as suddenly, the album disappeared from the ranking. “Nobody drops off the next week to zero,” says Hay, remembering his confusion. He called other artists to ask if they'd ever seen this before. They hadn't. Questions piled up. If so many people had listened, why did they suddenly stop? He scanned the internet for chatter. Even a single freaking tweet would have been nice. Nada. Where were the fans? “No one's talking about the music,” Hay realized.

WIRED profiles the people who make trouble—scams, drug deals, even murder—and also, occasionally, save the day.

Pulling up Spotify's dashboard for artists, Hay scrutinized the analytics for the pair's work. Listeners appeared concentrated in far-flung places like Vietnam. Things only got stranger from there. Here's how Hay remembers it: He started receiving notices from distributors, the companies that handle the licensing of indie artists' music. The distributors were flagging Smith and Hay's music, from Jazz and from other projects, for streaming fraud and pulling it down. Smith told Hay it was a mistake and that Hay had messed up securing the proper rights for samples. Hay frantically tried to correct the issue, but the flagging persisted.

Hay, panicking, badgered Smith to help him figure out what was happening. Finally, Hay says, Smith offered some answers: Smith had instructed his staff at the medical clinics to stream their songs. It didn't sound like the full story.

Then, last September, Smith turned up at the heart of another music streaming incident, this one rather epic. The FBI arrested him and charged him in the first AI streaming fraud case in the United States. The government claims that between 2017 and 2024, Smith made over $10 million in royalties by using bot armies to continuously play AI-generated tracks on streaming platforms. Smith pleaded not guilty to all charges. (Through his lawyer, Smith declined to be interviewed, so this is very much Hay's side of the story, corroborated by numerous interviews with people who worked with the two men.)

When Hay found out, he marveled at the idea of his former collaborator managing to get richer than nearly all working musicians without being a household name. “He had a billion streams,” Hay claims, “and no fans.”

When he first met Smith in 2013, Hay was working as a publicist; to make extra cash, he sold online PR consulting to aspiring musicians at $250 a session. Smith came across those sessions and signed up. “He did something really grandiose,” Hay says. “He booked like 20 hours.” Ka-ching!

Smith flew in for his tutorial in person. Though Hay was the local, Smith picked the meeting spot, a sports bar in a strip mall. (“Control freak,” Hay says now.) The way Hay understood it, Smith had amassed a fortune running medical clinics. As his next act, Hay says, Smith wanted to get famous, and he was willing to spend whatever it took. By the end of the first consultation, he says, they were simpatico: Smith yearned to be a star, Hay a starmaker.

The two men quickly settled on a strategy. Although Smith wanted to be an artist himself, they'd start a label called SMH Records and work their way through the industry as producers and behind-the-scenes movers—basically, paying their way in. “Spared no expenses on the budget,” says B. Stille, one of the members of the southern rap group Nappy Roots, who worked with Smith and Hay a few times. One of the pair's first wins was coproducing a buzzy single for the group. Smith also financed, and became a judge on, BET's One Shot, where he scouted for rap's next stars alongside DJ Khaled, Twista, and T.I., despite the fact that they were all big-name hip-hop stars and he was a relatively unknown record producer with a checkbook.

Around the time Smith started working on One Shot, Hay began to suspect that his buddy's finances were not all in order. He and another SMH employee dug around to see what they could uncover about their colleague. In February 2015, Hay sent their business associates a 111-page document accusing Smith of financial mismanagement. Hay thought it was his “Jerry Maguire moment.” He was confident he'd convince at least one other person that something was deeply wrong.

But others saw their relationship with Smith differently. “Everybody stayed with Mike,” he says. “It made me feel really stupid.” People in their circle trusted Smith, it seemed. Kxng Crooked, a rapper who judged with Smith on One Shot, found him wholesome. “I flew out to his house and played with his kids,” the rapper says. Goldy Locks, a musician on the SMH label, says she'd had “a completely positive experience” working with Smith. “Out of all the labels that I've ever been on, Mike's the only one that's ever taken care of us.”

One Shot aired in 2016, lasting for a single season. It marked a high point in Smith's career—and a downturn for Hay. In 2017, two men broke into Hay's apartment and held him and his daughter at gunpoint. Smith came to check on him afterward. Hay appreciated the gesture, and his anger faded. That is, until their jazz album came out and Hay began to suspect Smith again.

In the late 2010s, Smith linked up with Alex Mitchell, the CEO of an AI song generator startup called Boomy. AI song generators, which allow people to “create” music by selecting or customizing prompts about what the tunes should sound like, now have millions of users but were then a niche product. Smith was, it must be said, ahead of the curve here—few people appreciated then how omnipresent AI would become in the music world. In the government's indictment, Mitchell fits the description of an unnamed, not-charged co-conspirator: Starting around 2018, a “Chief Executive Officer of an AI music company” provided Smith with “thousands of songs each week.”

“Keep in mind what we're doing musically here ...,” the CEO wrote, per the indictment. “This is not ‘music,' it's ‘instant music' ;).” Smith allegedly assigned the AI songs to fake artists. The songs had otherworldly, -dictionary-scraping names: “Zygophyceae,” “Zygophyllaceae,” “Zygopteraceae.” The fake artists were equally odd, with names such as “Calm Force,” “Calm Knuckles,” “Calms Scorching,” and “Calorie Event.”

According to the indictment, Smith uploaded the music onto streaming platforms and, with the help of contractors, created thousands of accounts. Using “small pieces of computer code” that he'd bought, Smith was able to “continuously” play the music on those accounts—essentially commanding a custom bot army to play his AI tracks nonstop. Those plays triggered royalty payments. In other words, Smith was—if the allegations are true—cementing his status as a master purveyor of AI slop. Indeed, the ranks of AI slopstars are filling up fast with the hustlers flooding Amazon with crappy robo-books and the schemers gobbling up websites and turning them into AI content mills. The internet has become a warehouse of algorithmically manufactured imitations of cultural products, all of it spewed into existence by people trying to game the faulty creator economy and get rich quick.

Hay says he knew nothing about AI at the time. But he believed something was up with their streaming numbers. The pair's fighting intensified. “You steal from streaming platforms,” he accused Smith via email in December 2019. “These are federal crimes, bro.” Smith responded by resending the pair's legal agreement. Hay claims that Smith cut him out of deals and withheld income—and it made him snap. Hay dashed off another jeremiad to their associates. He wrote to Billboard employees and other people in their professional network outlining his suspicions. This time, Hay says, he was ready to cut ties. He says he went to the local police and even the FBI: “I blew the whistle as loud as I could.”

But then—once again—nothing happened. A Billboard employee eventually texted Hay that the company had decided not to pursue an investigation. (Billboard declined to comment on this particular incident, though a spokesperson for Penske Media Corporation, which now owns and operates Billboard, noted that it will remove inaccurate records if it is made aware of the problem in a timely fashion. Billboard records from Smith and Hay still stand.) Embarrassed, Hay told the Billboard team that he had gone off his medication. He certainly felt crazy.

Smith, meanwhile, wasn't having a great time either. He was navigating a lawsuit from staffers at his medical offices, who claimed that his clinics had engaged in Medicaid and Medicare fraud. The lawsuit alleges that Smith was moving money from the clinics into SMH Records, which was something Hay had suspected. Smith and his codefendants reached a settlement in 2020, requiring them to pay $900,000.

Nevertheless, by 2022 Smith seemed to be back on a roll. He produced a song featuring Snoop Dogg and Billy Ray Cyrus. He was also lining up a slate of ambitious projects—including a horror movie with RZA and an animated series in which a cartoon Smith would travel to the afterlife, set to music by Snoop Dogg and RZA. (Neither Snoop Dogg nor RZA responded to requests for comment.) But success turns on a dime in this business, and by the following year something appeared to have changed. Smith went silent on Insta-gram. The horror movie came out without much fanfare. According to a timeline included in the criminal indictment, Smith was spending at least some of that time trying to convince groups within the streaming industry that he was legitimate. Then, in spring 2023, he received a notice that dealt a major blow. The Mechanical Licensing Collective, a nonprofit entity that collects and dispenses royalties for streaming services, had confronted Smith about fraud and was now halting payments. A crucial money spigot had turned off.

On September 4, 2024, federal agents pulled up to Smith's sprawling Colonial Revival–style brick home. They handcuffed him and perp-walked him out to their navy sprinter van, past his three-car garage, as befuddled neighbors looked on.

For Hay, the arrest was a vindication. In the indictment, Hay—who fits the description of an unnamed “Co-Conspirator 2” and is not charged with a crime—comes across as something of a patsy, the person whose work Smith used to “fraudulently generate royalty payments” before pivoting to AI. Other people in Smith's orbit have expressed surprise. Music promoter Bram Bessoff, who is registered as a cowriter on hundreds of Smith's AI songs, expressed “total shock” to WIRED and says he's cooperating with authorities. (While Bessoff is neither named nor charged in the indictment, “Co-Conspirator 4” is described as a music promoter.) Meanwhile, Boomy CEO Alex Mitchell, who was also registered on hundreds of the songs along with Bessoff and Smith, declined to respond to questions. A spokesperson for Boomy, Phoebe Myers, told WIRED that neither Mitchell nor Boomy “had any knowledge or involvement in Smith's alleged criminal conduct,” nor had they “engaged in bot streaming or knew of any bot streaming by Smith.” Myers adds that Mitchell did not have any relationship with Smith's music publishing company.

Included in the government's indictment is an excerpt from a jubilant email Smith sent to his co-conspirators (the ones who sound an awful lot like Mitchell and Bessoff). In it, he wrote about how they'd be receiving 10 percent cuts on the royalties generated by the songs: “We are at 88 million TOTAL STREAMS so far!!!”

Technically, it's not illegal to make a bonkers amount of AI-generated music and put it on a streaming service. Tacky, yes. Disrespectful to the art form, probably. But not necessarily against the law. In fact, it's pretty common: Deezer, a French music streaming platform, estimates that 10 percent of the songs uploaded every day are AI-generated. If a company were to train its song generator on copyrighted music without permission, it could run into trouble if music labels alleged that use case was illegal, as happened to Suno and Udio, two companies that are now the subject of lawsuits. Boomy appears to be aboveboard on this count—it has been certified by Fairly Trained, a nonprofit that checks whether generative AI companies got consent to use their training materials. So the first part of Smith's (alleged) scheme might, at most, be violating laws of good taste.

Then there are the bots and fake accounts. Major streaming services often prohibit their use in their terms of service. Last year, a man in Denmark was found guilty of committing music streaming fraud by using bots to play his music on Spotify and Apple Music. Still, the vast majority of such behavior goes unpunished. Morgan Hayduk, the co-CEO of a streaming-fraud-detection startup called Beatdapp, has monitored whole networks of bad actors siphoning money from streamers. “Conservatively, it's a billion-dollar-a-year type of problem,” Hayduk says. “The Michael Smith case is the tip of the iceberg.”

A 2021 study by France's National Music Center found that around 1 to 3 percent of all streams were fraudulent; Beatdapp puts that number at around 10 percent. According to Hayduk, some of the startup's clients consistently flag 17 to 25 percent of streams as fraudulent, and occasionally as many as half. As he sees it, AI song generators are a “supercharger” for this behavior, and Smith's alleged scheme isn't especially cutting-edge. “If you're a sophisticated, organized criminal,” Hayduk says, “you would do this from the comfort of a beach in a non-extradition country.”

It remains unclear which streaming companies ended up paying Smith the most money, probably because nobody wants to admit their detection efforts flopped. Spotify, the industry's behemoth, claims that its fraud detection programs caught Smith's alleged chicanery. “It appears our preventative measures worked and limited the royalties Smith was able to generate from Spotify to approximately $60,000 of the $10 million,” says Laura Batey, a company spokesperson. Apple, YouTube Music, and Tidal did not respond to questions; Amazon declined to answer questions about Smith. While distributors and streaming services are leaning on sophisticated fraud detection in an AI-versus-AI war, some industry experts argue that the real problem is the streaming companies' royalty payment structures and that only a total overhaul can curb the problem.

In some corners of the music world, Smith isn't seen as a villain. Musicians often accuse streaming platforms, and of course labels, of ripping off artists. Goldy Locks, Smith's former client, says some people view him as a modern-day Robin Hood. Others see him as a man who exploited an exploitative system, a creature native to a grift-addled environment. After all, radio invented payola, and Spotify inserts bulk-produced stock songs into popular playlists. The line between organic and paid audiences has always been blurry. Even in 19th-century France, “claqueurs” were paid to fill opera houses and clap.

Smith is now out on bail. His lawyer, Noell Tin, said in a statement that “Mike Smith is a successful songwriter, musical artist, devoted husband, and father to six children. He looks forward to responding to the charges against him in court.” The case, brought in the US Southern District Court of New York, will be heard by Judge John Koeltl, who has a history with consequential tech lawsuits, including a ruling against the Internet Archive and an ongoing case against the crypto hub Binance. If found guilty, Smith faces up to 60 years in prison. Either way, Smith has earned a seat in the music business pantheon: The government has cast him as an avatar for the AI era's gifts to grifters. Anybody can click a few buttons and make a song now. But building a fortune off these audienceless ditties? From one angle, it might be a crime. From another, it's a new art.

Texas is set to lead the nation in restrictive legislation. Under a proposed bill, minors would be banned from social media, while platforms would also be required to introduce age verification methods. While supporters say the change would make children safer, critics argue that such legislation may do the exact opposite.

Introduced in November, House Bill 186 would prevent minors from creating accounts on social media platforms like Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and more. Platforms would be required to use “public or private transactional data” to verify that account holders are at least 18 years old. In addition, parents could request the deletion of any of their child's existing accounts. Companies would have to cooperate with that request within 10 days.

Under the law, social media platforms are limited to public websites or applications that allow users to communicate with each other “for the primary purpose of posting information, comments, messages, or images.” It wouldn't apply to e-mail, news, or gambling sties.

The bill's author, Rep. Jared Patterson, has consistently framed HB 186 as addressing a mental health crisis. In a March social media post, he wrote, “I consider this to be the most important bill I will present to my House colleagues this session. After extensive research, it's clear: social media is the most harmful product our kids have legal access to in Texas.”

According to the Age Verification Providers Associate, 10 states have passed their own legislation restricting minors' social media access since June 2024. Many laws center around limiting access to porn, like Texas' pre-existing HB 1181, which requires age verification if at least a third of a website's content is “sexual material harmful to minors.” (That law is now at the center of a Supreme Court case.) But per the Texas Tribune, Florida is the only other state with a similar outright ban on social media for minors. However, it only extends to those under 14.

HB 186 has already passed Texas' House with bipartisan support and, so far, it seems that members of the Senate are fans as well. Per the Texas Tribune, Sen. Adam Hinojosa, co-sponsor, told fellow lawmakers at a recent State Affairs Committee hearing, “Like so many parents across our state, I've watched my children grow up in a world that feels less and less safe, not because of where they go physically, but because of where they go online, in spaces that my wife and I cannot possibly monitor at all times.”

“We have the ability and the power to act today,” Hinojosa also told lawmakers. “With House Bill 186, we confront the evil before us and boldly say, ‘You cannot have our children.'”

It's true that social media harms youth (and adults, too). In 2023, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned that although social media's impacts aren't fully understood, “There are ample indicators that [it] can also have a profound risk of harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents.” Following Murthy's comments, the American Psychological Association released a health advisory on adolescent social media use. It also released a report with the American Federation for Teachers and several other organizations detailing social media's contribution to worsening mental health.

But strict bills like HB 186 don't necessarily address that problem. As Morgan McGuire, a 17-year-old Texas resident and TikTok creator, said, per the Texas Tribune, “The harmful content that young people are exposed to online does not disappear when they turn 18. The bill throws young adults into a digital world at a time when they are living on their own for the first time, without the support systems that they had as minors, which can have serious harm on mental health.”

Age verification bills have also faced backlash for violating First Amendment rights. In a statement, Megan Stokes, state policy director for the Computer & Communications Industry Association, said, “HB 186 conflicts with Texas contract law and undermines teens' rights to access information, express themselves, and participate in today's digital economy…[It] is a flawed proposal, one that censors speech rather than supporting families with tools and education.”

In a letter, trade association NetChoice's director of policy, Patrick Hedger, noted that age verification laws in several other states are already being challenged and blocked by courts, including in Arkansas, California, Mississippi, Texas, and Utah. Hedger also said that Texas' proposed legislation “usurps parental decision making,” writing, “Every family has different needs. Some parents may allow their child to use YouTube Kids for educational videos, and others may choose to let their teen join a moderated online community to discuss their hobbies or interests.”

“These are choices that parents and guardians should have the right to make depending on their own child's needs — rather than the government mandating how families in Texas use the internet,” Hedger continued.

Along with First Amendment concerns, age verification bills like HB 186 are privacy nightmares. Although the legislation says that social media platforms must delete personal data gathered for age verification, it doesn't explicitly state how soon nor does it provide social media platforms with guidance on how to prove their compliance. Per Hedger, this oversight incentivizes platforms to collect “multiple forms of personally-identifiable information.”

“Platforms may utilize and delete one piece of ‘transactional data' for age verification, while collecting and retaining other personal data for purposes of legal defense,” Hedger wrote. “This means websites would need to collect and store sensitive information, creating massive databases that will inevitable become targets for hackers.”

Google is talking about Personalized Smart Replies, which will be integrated into Gmail this summer. Gmail can take your personal history from Drive, Docs, Sheets, and other Google services, then use that info, paired with how you typically write, to send emails on your behalf. So if someone emails you asking for trip recommendations, it can generate all that for you, referencing your past itineraries, and send it off.

Soon, it will be bots just emailing bots.

In this short little demo of Project Astra built into Gemini on the phone—which is available on iOS and Android today—Google did a clever little inversion in which the human using it was hallucinating fake shit and the AI model was correcting the human. “Why does this person keep following me?” the person asked, pointing their phone at their shadow as they walked down the street. “That's your shadow,” the AI said.

AI will ruin reality before it ultimately proposes a solution to fix it.

Last year at I/O, Google announced how it was jamming generative AI into search by showing more people AI overviews (summaries) when they searched for things. It was a change to the world-search order, in which Google was deprioritizing links and, as I described it at the time, taking the index cards for the screenplay it had written for the past twenty-five years and throwing them to the wind.

This year, Google's going to be talking a lot about AI Mode, a tab within the native search app that is supposedly going to be more conversational and have a longer memory.

I'm a little confused as to what a “user” of AI Overviews means in this context. Does that count everyone who's using Search and seeing AI-generated answers at the top of results? It's not a feature users can opt-out from.

If you gaze up at the night sky, there's a good chance you'll spot a trail of fast-moving, bright dots—newly launched Starlink satellites. But you might soon also see something else: spacecraft from Chinese projects building their own Starlink-like low Earth orbit satellite internet networks. More than 100 satellites have been launched from China since August—the first batches of two mega-constellations that are aiming to have about 28,000 satellites combined when they're completed.

The two Chinese projects are officially called Guowang and Qianfan, but they each have a confusing set of alternative names in English due to their corporate structures and language differences. The former, which is also known as Xingwang or SatNet, is primarily focused on domestic telecommunications and national security use cases. The latter, which is also known as Spacesail or SSST, is more oriented toward providing service to foreign telecom companies. So far, Qianfan has signed deals with Brazil, Malaysia, and Thailand and has said it's eyeing dozens of other markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Compared to Starlink, which operates more than 7,000 satellites, China is clearly still playing catch-up. But Guowang and Qianfan are joining a group of Starlink competitors around the world accelerating their operations, and they could give the market leader a run for its money in the end. The newcomers also stand to benefit as CEO Elon Musk's deepening entanglements in US politics raises reputational and security risks for SpaceX (Starlink's parent company) globally.

“2023 and 2024 were the years of Starlink deployment. 2025 is the year of other actors getting into the game,” says Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory who has been tracking satellite constellations globally. “In the West, we severely underreport the commercial side of the Chinese space industry.”

But as Guowang and Qianfan launch their first batches of satellites, they are also running into troubles, including higher numbers of faulty satellites than SpaceX, bureaucratic hurdles, and limited rocket launch capacity. And if they don't launch enough satellites into space soon, they could be asked by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the United Nations body that coordinates space launches, to scale down the size of their planned constellations.

Guowang and Qianfan couldn't be reached for comment. SpaceX didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.

As of last month, Qianfan has launched 90 satellites that will provide broadband internet service for ground users, while Guowang has launched 29. The latter has also launched around a dozen experimental satellites since 2023, but it hasn't been transparent about their purpose, and it seemingly doesn't count them toward the numbers in its official constellation.

While Qianfan is slightly ahead, it is also grappling with a significant issue: a concerningly high rate of possible faulty satellites compared to other, similar projects. Unlike Starlink, which publishes GPS information of its satellites in orbit, the Chinese companies have disclosed little about how their satellites are doing. Instead, researchers have relied on data collected by the US Space Force, which tracks all space objects by radar and releases public data about them.

Jonathan McDowell, a researcher who maintains a website that analyzes information collected about low Earth orbit satellite networks, says that, of the 90 satellites that Qianfan has launched, 13 seem to have exhibited irregular behavior, namely they didn't rise up to their target orbit height along with their peers. Qianfan's second batch, which it launched in October 2024, contained only five satellites that reached their planned height out of 18, according to McDowell.

McDowell says these satellites are not necessarily dead—some could be dormant, waiting for better positioning opportunities—but overall, Qianfan's satellites clearly underperform compared to others. While Starlink started with about a 3 percent failure rate, it has since gone down to less than 0.5 percent, according to McDowell's data. OneWeb, the British mega-constellation with over 600 satellites, contains only two failed ones that are stuck in space.

According to the Shanghai local government, Qianfan's second batch of satellites are made by a different manufacturing supplier, Genesat, which could be related to why it performed worse than other batches. It was the first time Genesat delivered mass-produced satellites, a press release at launch time said.

Another problem is that Qianfan and Guowang are literally aiming higher. Both projects have opted to put their satellites in higher orbits than Starlink, making their failed satellites harder to deorbit and more likely to become long-term space debris. Given the planned sizes of these mega-constellations, their higher failure rates could mean that space will be crowded with even more dead satellites.

“What can happen is that you will have so many satellites operating in the same orbital shell that you're constantly having to move your satellite out of concerns of close approach,” says

Victoria Samson, chief director of space security and stability at Secure World Foundation, a nonprofit organization focusing on outer space sustainability.

That will create logistical burdens and extra costs for other satellite operators, and Samson says there

Here's how MIT Technology Review waded through a mess of data and hidden variables to calculate the individual and collective energy demand from AI.

When we set out to write a story on the best available estimates for AI's energy and emissions burden, we knew there would be caveats and uncertainties to these numbers. But, we quickly discovered, the caveats are the story too. 

This story is a part of MIT Technology Review's series “Power Hungry: AI and our energy future,” on the energy demands and carbon costs of the artificial-intelligence revolution.

Measuring the energy used by an AI model is not like evaluating a car's fuel economy or an appliance's energy rating. There's no agreed-upon method or public database of values. There are no regulators who enforce standards, and consumers don't get the chance to evaluate one model against another. 

Despite the fact that billions of dollars are being poured into reshaping energy infrastructure around the needs of AI, no one has settled on a way to quantify AI's energy usage. Worse, companies are generally unwilling to disclose their own piece of the puzzle. There are also limitations to estimating the emissions associated with that energy demand, because the grid hosts a complicated, ever-changing mix of energy sources. 

It's a big mess, basically. So, that said, here are the many variables, assumptions, and caveats that we used to calculate the consequences of an AI query. (You can see the full results of our investigation here.)

Companies like OpenAI, dealing in “closed-source” models, generally offer access to their  systems through an interface where you input a question and receive an answer. What happens in between—which data center in the world processes your request, the energy it takes to do so, and the carbon intensity of the energy sources used—remains a secret, knowable only to the companies. There are few incentives for them to release this information, and so far, most have not.

That's why, for our analysis, we looked at open-source models. They serve as a very imperfect proxy but the best one we have. (OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google declined to share specifics on how much energy their closed-source models use.) 

The best resources for measuring the energy consumption of open-source AI models are AI Energy Score, ML.Energy, and MLPerf Power. The team behind ML.Energy assisted us with our text and image model calculations, and the team behind AI Energy Score helped with our video model calculations.

AI models use up energy in two phases: when they initially learn from vast amounts of data, called training, and when they respond to queries, called inference. When ChatGPT was launched a few years ago, training was the focus, as tech companies raced to keep up and build ever-bigger models. But now, inference is where the most energy is used.

The most accurate way to understand how much energy an AI model uses in the inference stage is to directly measure the amount of electricity used by the server handling the request. Servers contain all sorts of components—powerful chips called GPUs that do the bulk of the computing, other chips called CPUs, fans to keep everything cool, and more. Researchers typically measure the amount of power the GPU draws and estimate the rest (more on this shortly). 

To do this, we turned to PhD candidate Jae-Won Chung and associate professor Mosharaf Chowdhury at the University of Michigan, who lead the ML.Energy project. Once we collected figures for different models' GPU energy use from their team, we had to estimate how much energy is used for other processes, like cooling. We examined research literature, including a 2024 paper from Microsoft, to understand how much of a server's total energy demand GPUs are responsible for. It turns out to be about half. So we took the team's GPU energy estimate and doubled it to get a sense of total energy demands. 

The ML.Energy team uses a batch of 500 prompts from a larger dataset to test models. The hardware is kept the same throughout; the GPU is a popular Nvidia chip called the H100. We decided to focus on models of three sizes from the Meta Llama family: small (8 billion parameters), medium (70 billion), and large (405 billion). We also identified a selection of prompts to test. We compared these with the averages for the entire batch of 500 prompts. 

Stable Diffusion 3 from Stability AI is one of the most commonly used open-source image-generating models, so we made it our focus. Though we tested multiple sizes of the text-based Meta Llama model, we focused on one of the most popular sizes of Stable Diffusion 3, with 2 billion parameters. 

The team uses a dataset of example prompts to test a model's energy requirements. Though the energy used by large language models is determined partially by the prompt, this isn't true for diffusion models. Diffusion models can be programmed to go through a prescribed number of “denoising steps” when they generate an image or video, with each step being an iteration of the algorithm that adds more detail to the image. For a given step count and model, all images generated have the same energy footprint.

The more steps, the higher quality the end result—but the more energy used. Numbers of steps vary by model and application, but 25 is pretty common, and that's what we used for our standard quality. For higher quality, we used 50 steps. 

We mentioned that GPUs are usually responsible for about half of the energy demands of large language model requests. There is not sufficient research to know how this changes for diffusion models that generate images and videos. In the absence of a better estimate, and after consulting with researchers, we opted to stick with this 50% rule of thumb for images and videos too.

Chung and Chowdhury do test video models, but only ones that generate short, low-quality GIFs. We don't think the videos these models produce mirror the fidelity of the AI-generated video that many people are used to seeing. 

Instead, we turned to Sasha Luccioni, the AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, who directs the AI Energy Score project. She measures the energy used by the GPU during AI requests. We chose two versions of the CogVideoX model to test: an older, lower-quality version and a newer, higher-quality one. 

We asked Luccioni to use her tool, called Code Carbon, to test both and measure the results of a batch of video prompts we selected, using the same hardware as our text and image tests to keep as many variables as possible the same. She reported the GPU energy demands, which we again doubled to estimate total energy demands. 

After we understand how much energy it takes to respond to a query, we can translate that into the total emissions impact. Doing so requires looking at the power grid from which data centers draw their electricity. 

Nailing down the climate impact of the grid can be complicated, because it's both interconnected and incredibly local. Imagine the grid as a system of connected canals and pools of water. Power plants add water to the canals, and electricity users, or loads, siphon it out. In the US, grid interconnections stretch all the way across the country. So, in a way, we're all connected, but we can also break the grid up into its component pieces to get a sense for how energy sources vary across the country. 

The key metric to understand here is called carbon intensity, which is basically a measure of how many grams of carbon dioxide pollution are released for every kilowatt-hour of electricity that's produced. 

To get carbon intensity figures, we reached out to Electricity Maps, a Danish startup company that gathers data on grids around the world. The team collects information from sources including governments and utilities and uses them to publish historical and real-time estimates of the carbon intensity of the grid. You can find more about their methodology here. 

The company shared with us historical data from 2024, both for the entire US and for a few key balancing authorities (more on this in a moment). After discussions with Electricity Maps founder Olivier Corradi and other experts, we made a few decisions about which figures we would use in our calculations. 

One way to measure carbon intensity is to simply look at all the power plants that are operating on the grid, add up the pollution they're producing at the moment, and divide that total by the electricity they're producing. But that doesn't account for the emissions that are associated with building and tearing down power plants, which can be significant. So we chose to use carbon intensity figures that account for the whole life cycle of a power plant. 

We also chose to use the consumption-based carbon intensity of energy rather than production-based. This figure accounts for imports and exports moving between different parts of the grid and best represents the electricity that's being used, in real time, within a given region. 

For most of the calculations you see in the story, we used the average carbon intensity for the US for 2024, according to Electricity Maps, which is 402.49 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour. 

While understanding the picture across the entire US can be helpful, the grid can look incredibly different in different locations. 

One way we can break things up is by looking at balancing authorities. These are independent bodies responsible for grid balancing in a specific region. They operate mostly independently, though there's a constant movement of electricity between them as well. There are 66 balancing authorities in the US, and we can calculate a carbon intensity for the part of the grid encompassed by a specific balancing authority.

Electricity Maps provided carbon intensity figures for a few key balancing authorities, and we focused on several that play the largest roles in data center operations. ERCOT (which covers most of Texas) and PJM (a cluster of states on the East Coast, including Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey) are two of the regions with the largest burden of data centers, according to research from the Harvard School of Public Health. 

We added CAISO (in California) because it covers the most populated state in the US. CAISO also manages a grid with a significant number of renewable energy sources, making it a good example of how carbon intensity can change drastically depending on the time of day. (In the middle of the day, solar tends to dominate, while natural gas plays a larger role overnight, for example.)

One key caveat here is that we're not entirely sure where companies tend to send individual AI inference requests. There are clusters of data centers in the regions we chose as examples, but when you use a tech giant's AI model, your request could be handled by any number of data centers owned or contracted by the company. One reasonable approximation is location: It's likely that the data center servicing a request is close to where it's being made, so a request on the West Coast might be most likely to be routed to a data center on that side of the country. 

To better contextualize our calculations, we introduced a few comparisons people might be more familiar with than kilowatt-hours and grams of carbon dioxide. In a few places, we took the amount of electricity estimated to be used by a model and calculated how long that electricity would be able to power a standard microwave, as well as how far it might take someone on an e-bike. 

In the case of the e-bike, we assumed an efficiency of 25 watt-hours per mile, which falls in the range of frequently cited efficiencies for a pedal-assisted bike. For the microwave, we assumed an 800-watt model, which falls within the average range in the US. 

We also introduced a comparison to contextualize greenhouse gas emissions: miles driven in a gas-powered car. For this, we used data from the US Environmental Protection Agency, which puts the weighted average fuel economy of vehicles in the US in 2022 at 393 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per mile. 

After measuring the energy demand of an individual query and the emissions it generated, it was time to estimate how all of this added up to national demand. 

There are two ways to do this. In a bottom-up analysis, you estimate how many individual queries there are, calculate the energy demands of each, and add them up to determine the total. For a top-down look, you estimate how much energy all data centers are using by looking at larger trends. 

Bottom-up is particularly difficult, because, once again, closed-source companies do not share such information and declined to talk specifics with us. While we can make some educated guesses to give us a picture of what might be happening right now, looking into the future is perhaps better served by taking a top-down approach.

This data is scarce as well. The most important report was published in December by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which is funded by the Department of Energy, and the report authors noted that it's only the third such report released in the last 20 years. Academic climate and energy researchers we spoke with said it's a major problem that AI is not considered its own economic sector for emissions measurements, and there aren't rigorous reporting requirements. As a result, it's difficult to track AI's climate toll. 

Still, we examined the report's results, compared them with other findings and estimates, and consulted independent experts about the data. While much of the report was about data centers more broadly, we drew out data points that were specific to the future of AI. 

We wanted to contrast these figures with the amounts of energy that AI companies themselves say they need. To do so, we collected reports by leading tech and AI companies about their plans for energy and data center expansions, as well as the dollar amounts they promised to invest. Where possible, we fact-checked the promises made in these claims. (Meta and Microsoft's pledges to use more nuclear power, for example, would indeed reduce the carbon emissions of the companies, but it will take years, if not decades, for these additional nuclear plants to come online.) 

We submitted requests to Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI to have data-driven conversations about their models' energy demands for AI inference. None of the companies made executives or leadership available for on-the-record interviews about their energy usage.

The emissions from individual AI text, image, and video queries seem small—until you add up what the industry isn't tracking and consider where it's heading next.

AI's integration into our lives is the most significant shift in online life in more than a decade. Hundreds of millions of people now regularly turn to chatbots for help with homework, research, coding, or to create images and videos. But what's powering all of that?

Today, new analysis by MIT Technology Review provides an unprecedented and comprehensive look at how much energy the AI industry uses—down to a single query—to trace where its carbon footprint stands now, and where it's headed, as AI barrels towards billions of daily users.

This story is a part of MIT Technology Review's series “Power Hungry: AI and our energy future,” on the energy demands and carbon costs of the artificial-intelligence revolution.

We spoke to two dozen experts measuring AI's energy demands, evaluated different AI models and prompts, pored over hundreds of pages of projections and reports, and questioned top AI model makers about their plans. Ultimately, we found that the common understanding of AI's energy consumption is full of holes.

We started small, as the question of how much a single query costs is vitally important to understanding the bigger picture. That's because those queries are being built into ever more applications beyond standalone chatbots: from search, to agents, to the mundane daily apps we use to track our fitness, shop online, or book a flight. The energy resources required to power this artificial-intelligence revolution are staggering, and the world's biggest tech companies have made it a top priority to harness ever more of that energy, aiming to reshape our energy grids in the process.

Meta and Microsoft are working to fire up new nuclear power plants. OpenAI and President Donald Trump announced the Stargate initiative, which aims to spend $500 billion—more than the Apollo space program—to build as many as 10 data centers (each of which could require five gigawatts, more than the total power demand from the state of New Hampshire). Apple announced plans to spend $500 billion on manufacturing and data centers in the US over the next four years. Google expects to spend $75 billion on AI infrastructure alone in 2025.

This isn't simply the norm of a digital world. It's unique to AI, and a marked departure from Big Tech's electricity appetite in the recent past. From 2005 to 2017, the amount of electricity going to data centers remained quite flat thanks to increases in efficiency, despite the construction of armies of new data centers to serve the rise of cloud-based online services, from Facebook to Netflix. In 2017, AI began to change everything. Data centers started getting built with energy-intensive hardware designed for AI, which led them to double their electricity consumption by 2023. The latest reports show that 4.4% of all the energy in the US now goes toward data centers.

The carbon intensity of electricity used by data centers was 48% higher than the US average.

Given the direction AI is headed—more personalized, able to reason and solve complex problems on our behalf, and everywhere we look—it's likely that our AI footprint today is the smallest it will ever be. According to new projections published by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in December, by 2028 more than half of the electricity going to data centers will be used for AI. At that point, AI alone could consume as much electricity annually as 22% of all US households.

Meanwhile, data centers are expected to continue trending toward using dirtier, more carbon-intensive forms of energy (like gas) to fill immediate needs, leaving clouds of emissions in their wake. And all of this growth is for a new technology that's still finding its footing, and in many applications—education, medical advice, legal analysis—might be the wrong tool for the job or at least have a less energy-intensive alternative.

Tallies of AI's energy use often short-circuit the conversation—either by scolding individual behavior, or by triggering comparisons to bigger climate offenders. Both reactions dodge the point: AI is unavoidable, and even if a single query is low-impact, governments and companies are now shaping a much larger energy future around AI's needs.

We're taking a different approach with an accounting meant to inform the many decisions still ahead: where data centers go, what powers them, and how to make the growing toll of AI visible and accountable.

ChatGPT is now estimated to be the fifth-most visited website in the world, just after Instagram and ahead of X.

That's because despite the ambitious AI vision set forth by tech companies, utility providers, and the federal government, details of how this future might come about are murky. Scientists, federally funded research facilities, activists, and energy companies argue that leading AI companies and data center operators disclose too little about their activities. Companies building and deploying AI models are largely quiet when it comes to answering a central question: Just how much energy does interacting with one of these models use? And what sorts of energy sources will power AI's future?

This leaves even those whose job it is to predict energy demands forced to assemble a puzzle with countless missing pieces, making it nearly impossible to plan for AI's future impact on energy grids and emissions. Worse, the deals that utility companies make with the data centers will likely transfer the costs of the AI revolution to the rest of us, in the form of higher electricity bills.

It's a lot to take in. To describe the big picture of what that future looks like, we have to start at the beginning.

Before you can ask an AI model to help you with travel plans or generate a video, the model is born in a data center.

Racks of servers hum along for months, ingesting training data, crunching numbers, and performing computations. This is a time-consuming and expensive process—it's estimated that training OpenAI's GPT-4 took over $100 million and consumed 50 gigawatt-hours of energy, enough to power San Francisco for three days. It's only after this training, when consumers or customers “inference” the AI models to get answers or generate outputs, that model makers hope to recoup their massive costs and eventually turn a profit.

“For any company to make money out of a model—that only happens on inference,” says Esha Choukse, a researcher at Microsoft Azure who has studied how to make AI inference more efficient.

As conversations with experts and AI companies made clear, inference, not training, represents an increasing majority of AI's energy demands and will continue to do so in the near future. It's now estimated that 80–90% of computing power for AI is used for inference.

All this happens in data centers. There are roughly 3,000 such buildings across the United States that house servers and cooling systems and are run by cloud providers and tech giants like Amazon or Microsoft, but used by AI startups too. A growing number—though it's not clear exactly how many, since information on such facilities is guarded so tightly—are set up for AI inferencing.

At each of these centers, AI models are loaded onto clusters of servers containing special chips called graphics processing units, or GPUs, most notably a particular model made by Nvidia called the H100.

This chip started shipping in October 2022, just a month before ChatGPT launched to the public. Sales of H100s have soared since, and are part of why Nvidia regularly ranks as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.

Other chips include the A100 and the latest Blackwells. What all have in common is a significant energy requirement to run their advanced operations without overheating.

A single AI model might be housed on a dozen or so GPUs, and a large data center might have well over 10,000 of these chips connected together.

Wired close together with these chips are CPUs (chips that serve up information to the GPUs) and fans to keep everything cool.

Some energy is wasted at nearly every exchange through imperfect insulation materials and long cables in between racks of servers, and many buildings use millions of gallons of water (often fresh, potable water) per day in their cooling operations.

Depending on anticipated usage, these AI models are loaded onto hundreds or thousands of clusters in various data centers around the globe, each of which have different mixes of energy powering them.

They're then connected online, just waiting for you to ping them with a question.

If you've seen a few charts estimating the energy impact of putting a question to an AI model, you might think it's like measuring a car's fuel economy or a dishwasher's energy rating: a knowable value with a shared methodology for calculating it. You'd be wrong.

In reality, the type and size of the model, the type of output you're generating, and countless variables beyond your control—like which energy grid is connected to the data center your request is sent to and what time of day it's processed—can make one query thousands of times more energy-intensive and emissions-producing than another.

And when you query most AI models, whether on your phone within an app like Instagram or on the web interface for ChatGPT, much of what happens after your question is routed to a data center remains a secret. Factors like which data center in the world processes your request, how much energy it takes to do so, and how carbon-intensive the energy sources used are tend to be knowable only to the companies that run the models.

This is true for most of the name-brand models you're accustomed to, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude, which are referred to as “closed.” The key details are held closely by the companies that make them, guarded because they're viewed as trade secrets (and also possibly because they might result in bad PR). These companies face few incentives to release this information, and so far they have not.

“The closed AI model providers are serving up a total black box,” says Boris Gamazaychikov, head of AI sustainability at Salesforce, who has led efforts with researchers at Hugging Face, an AI platform provider of tools, models, and libraries for individuals and companies, to make AI's energy demands more transparent. Without more disclosure from companies, it's not just that we don't have good estimates—we have little to go on at all.

Without more disclosure from companies, it's not just that we don't have good estimates—we have little to go on at all.

So where can we turn for estimates? So-called open-source models can be downloaded and tweaked by researchers, who can access special tools to measure how much energy the H100 GPU requires for a given task. Such models are also incredibly popular; Meta announced in April that its Llama models have been downloaded more than 1.2 billion times, and many companies use open-source models when they want more control over outputs than they can get using something like ChatGPT.

But even if researchers can measure the power drawn by the GPU, that leaves out the power used up by CPUs, fans, and other equipment. A 2024 paper by Microsoft analyzed energy efficiencies for inferencing large language models and found that doubling the amount of energy used by the GPU gives an approximate estimate of the entire operation's energy demands.

So for now, measuring leading open-source models (and adding estimates for all these other pieces) gives us the best picture we have of just how much energy is being used for a single AI query. However, keep in mind that the ways people use AI today—to write a grocery list or create a surrealist video—are far simpler than the ones we'll use in the autonomous, agentic future that AI companies are hurling us toward. More on that later.

Here's what we found.

Let's start with models where you type a question and receive back a response in words. One of the leading groups evaluating the energy demands of AI is at the University of Michigan, led by PhD candidate Jae-Won Chung and associate professor Mosharaf Chowdhury. We worked with the team to focus on the energy demands of one of the most widely adopted open-source models, Meta's Llama.

The smallest model in our Llama cohort, Llama 3.1 8B, has 8 billion parameters—essentially the adjustable “knobs” in an AI model that allow it to make predictions. When tested on a variety of different text-generating prompts, like making a travel itinerary for Istanbul or explaining quantum computing, the model required about 57 joules per response, or an estimated 114 joules when accounting for cooling, other computations, and other demands. This is tiny—about what it takes to ride six feet on an e-bike, or run a microwave for one-tenth of a second.

The largest of our text-generation cohort, Llama 3.1 405B, has 50 times more parameters. More parameters generally means better answers but more energy required for each response. On average, this model needed 3,353 joules, or an estimated 6,706 joules total, for each response. That's enough to carry a person about 400 feet on an e-bike or run the microwave for eight seconds.

So model size is a huge predictor of energy demand. One reason is that once a model gets to a certain size, it has to be run on more chips, each of which adds to the energy required. The largest model we tested has 405 billion parameters, but others, such as DeepSeek, have gone much further, with over 600 billion parameters. The parameter counts for closed-source models are not publicly disclosed and can only be estimated. GPT-4 is estimated to have over 1 trillion parameters.

But in all these cases, the prompt itself was a huge factor too. Simple prompts, like a request to tell a few jokes, frequently used nine times less energy than more complicated prompts to write creative stories or recipe ideas.

AI models that generate images and videos work with a different architecture, called diffusion. Rather than predicting and generating words, they learn how to transform an image of noise into, let's say, a photo of an elephant. They do this by learning the contours and patterns of pictures in their training data and storing this information across millions or billions of parameters. Video-generator models learn how to do this across the dimension of time as well.

The energy required by a given diffusion model doesn't depend on your prompt—generating an image of a skier on sand dunes requires the same amount of energy as generating one of an astronaut farming on Mars. The energy requirement instead depends on the size of the model, the image resolution, and the number of “steps” the diffusion process takes (more steps lead to higher quality but need more energy).

Generating a standard-quality image (1024 x 1024 pixels) with Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, the leading open-source image generator, with 2 billion parameters, requires about 1,141 joules of GPU energy. With diffusion models, unlike large language models, there are no estimates of how much GPUs are responsible for the total energy required, but experts suggested we stick with the “doubling” approach we've used thus far because the differences are likely subtle. That means an estimated 2,282 joules total. Improving the image quality by doubling the number diffusion steps to 50 just about doubles the energy required, to about 4,402 joules. That's equivalent to about 250 feet on an e-bike, or around five and a half seconds running a microwave. That's still less than the largest text model.

This might be surprising if you imagined generating images to require more energy than generating text. “Large [text] models have a lot of parameters,” says Chung, who performed the measurements on open-source text and image generators featured in this story. “Even though they are generating text, they are doing a lot of work. ” Image generators, on the other hand, often work with fewer parameters.

Videos generated by CogVideoX, an open-source model.

Last year, OpenAI debuted Sora, its dazzling tool for making high-fidelity videos with AI. Other closed-source video models have come out as well, like Google Veo2 and Adobe's Firefly.

Given the eye-watering amounts of capital and content it takes to train these models, it's no surprise that free-to-use, open-source models generally lag behind in quality. Still, according to researchers at Hugging Face, one of the best is CogVideoX, made by a Chinese AI startup called Zhipu AI and researchers from Tsinghua University in Beijing.

Sasha Luccioni, an AI and climate researcher at Hugging Face, tested the energy required to generate videos with the model using a tool called Code Carbon.

An older version of the model, released in August, made videos at just eight frames per second at a grainy resolution—more like a GIF than a video. Each one required about 109,000 joules to produce. But three months later the company launched a larger, higher-quality model that produces five-second videos at 16 frames per second (this frame rate still isn't high definition; it's the one used in Hollywood's silent era until the late 1920s). The new model uses more than 30 times more energy on each 5-second video: about 3.4 million joules, more than 700 times the energy required to generate a high-quality image. This is equivalent to riding 38 miles on an e-bike, or running a microwave for over an hour.

It's fair to say that the leading AI video generators, creating dazzling and hyperrealistic videos up to 30 seconds long, will use significantly more energy. As these generators get larger, they're also adding features that allow you to tweak particular elements of videos and stitch multiple shots together into scenes—all of which add to their energy demands. A note: AI companies have defended these numbers saying that generative video has a smaller footprint than the film shoots and travel that go into typical video production. That claim is hard to test and doesn't account for the surge in video generation that might follow if AI videos become cheap to produce.

So what might a day's energy consumption look like for one person with an AI habit?

Let's say you're running a marathon as a charity runner and organizing a fundraiser to support your cause. You ask an AI model 15 questions about the best way to fundraise.

Then you make 10 attempts at an image for your flyer before you get one you are happy with, and three attempts at a five-second video to post on Instagram.

You'd use about 2.9 kilowatt-hours of electricity—enough to ride over 100 miles on an e-bike (or around 10 miles in the average electric vehicle) or run the microwave for over three and a half hours.

There is a significant caveat to this math. These numbers cannot serve as a proxy for how much energy is required to power something like ChatGPT 4o. We don't know how many parameters are in OpenAI's newest models, how many of those parameters are used for different model architectures, or which data centers are used and how OpenAI may distribute requests across all these systems. You can guess, as many have done, but those guesses are so approximate that they may be more distracting than helpful.

“We should stop trying to reverse-engineer numbers based on hearsay,” Luccioni says, “and put more pressure on these companies to actually share the real ones.” Luccioni has created the AI Energy Score, a way to rate models on their energy efficiency. But closed-source companies have to opt in. Few have, Luccioni says.

Now that we have an estimate of the total energy required to run an AI model to produce text, images, and videos, we can work out what that means in terms of emissions that cause climate change.

First, a data center humming away isn't necessarily a bad thing. If all data centers were hooked up to solar panels and ran only when the sun was shining, the world would be talking a lot less about AI's energy consumption. That's not the case. Most electrical grids around the world are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels. So electricity use comes with a climate toll attached.

“AI data centers need constant power, 24-7, 365 days a year,” says Rahul Mewawalla, the CEO of Mawson Infrastructure Group, which builds and maintains high-energy data centers that support AI.

That means data centers can't rely on intermittent technologies like wind and solar power, and on average, they tend to use dirtier electricity. One preprint study from Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that the carbon intensity of electricity used by data centers was 48% higher than the US average. Part of the reason is that data centers currently happen to be clustered in places that have dirtier grids on average, like the coal-heavy grid in the mid-Atlantic region that includes Virginia, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. They also run constantly, including when cleaner sources may not be available.

Data centers can't rely on intermittent technologies like wind and solar power, and on average, they tend to use dirtier electricity.

Tech companies like Meta, Amazon, and Google have responded to this fossil fuel issue by announcing goals to use more nuclear power. Those three have joined a pledge to triple the world's nuclear capacity by 2050. But today, nuclear energy only accounts for 20% of electricity supply in the US, and powers a fraction of AI data centers' operations—natural gas accounts for more than half of electricity generated in Virginia, which has more data centers than any other US state, for example. What's more, new nuclear operations will take years, perhaps decades, to materialize.

In 2024, fossil fuels including natural gas and coal made up just under  60% of electricity supply in the US.  Nuclear accounted for about 20%, and a mix of renewables accounted for most of the remaining 20%.

Gaps in power supply, combined with the rush to build data centers to power AI, often mean shortsighted energy plans. In April, Elon Musk's X supercomputing center near Memphis was found, via satellite imagery, to be using dozens of methane gas generators that the Southern Environmental Law Center alleges are not approved by energy regulators to supplement grid power and are violating the Clean Air Act.

The key metric used to quantify the emissions from these data centers is called the carbon intensity: how many grams of carbon dioxide emissions are produced for each kilowatt-hour of electricity consumed. Nailing down the carbon intensity of a given grid requires understanding the emissions produced by each individual power plant in operation, along with the amount of energy each is contributing to the grid at any given time. Utilities, government agencies, and researchers use estimates of average emissions, as well as real-time measurements, to track pollution from power plants.

This intensity varies widely across regions. The US grid is fragmented, and the mixes of coal, gas, renewables, or nuclear vary widely. California's grid is far cleaner than West Virginia's, for example.

Time of day matters too. For instance, data from April 2024 shows that California's grid can swing from under 70 grams per kilowatt-hour in the afternoon when there's a lot of solar power available to over 300 grams per kilowatt-hour in the middle of the night.

This variability means that the same activity may have very different climate impacts, depending on your location and the time you make a request. Take that charity marathon runner, for example. The text, image, and video responses they requested add up to 2.9 kilowatt-hours of electricity. In California, generating that amount of electricity would produce about 650 grams of carbon dioxide pollution on average. But generating that electricity in West Virginia might inflate the total to more than 1,150 grams.

What we've seen so far is that the energy required to respond to a query can be relatively small, but it can vary a lot, depending on the type of query and the model being used. The emissions associated with that given amount of electricity will also depend on where and when a query is handled. But what does this all add up to?

ChatGPT is now estimated to be the fifth-most visited website in the world, just after Instagram and ahead of X. In December, OpenAI said that ChatGPT receives 1 billion messages every day, and after the company launched a new image generator in March, it said that people were using it to generate 78 million images per day, from Studio Ghibli–style portraits to pictures of themselves as Barbie dolls.

Given the direction AI is headed—more personalized, able to reason and solve complex problems on our behalf, and everywhere we look—it's likely that our AI footprint today is the smallest it will ever be.

One can do some very rough math to estimate the energy impact. In February the AI research firm Epoch AI published an estimate of how much energy is used for a single ChatGPT query—an estimate that, as discussed, makes lots of assumptions that can't be verified. Still, they calculated about 0.3 watt-hours, or 1,080 joules, per message. This falls in between our estimates for the smallest and largest Meta Llama models (and experts we consulted say that if anything, the real number is likely higher, not lower).

One billion of these every day for a year would mean over 109 gigawatt-hours of electricity, enough to power 10,400 US homes for a year. If we add images and imagine that generating each one requires as much energy as it does with our high-quality image models, it'd mean an additional 35 gigawatt-hours, enough to power another 3,300 homes for a year. This is on top of the energy demands of OpenAI's other products, like video generators, and that for all the other AI companies and startups.

But here's the problem: These estimates don't capture the near future of how we'll use AI. In that future, we won't simply ping AI models with a question or two throughout the day, or have them generate a photo. Instead, leading labs are racing us toward a world where AI “agents” perform tasks for us without our supervising their every move. We will speak to models in voice mode, chat with companions for 2 hours a day, and point our phone cameras at our surroundings in video mode. We will give complex tasks to so-called “reasoning models” that work through tasks logically but have been found to require 43 times more energy for simple problems, or “deep research” models that spend hours creating reports for us. We will have AI models that are “personalized” by training on our data and preferences.

This future is around the corner: OpenAI will reportedly offer agents for $20,000 per month and will use reasoning capabilities in all of its models moving forward, and DeepSeek catapulted “chain of thought” reasoning into the mainstream with a model that often generates nine pages of text for each response. AI models are being added to everything from customer service phone lines to doctor's offices, rapidly increasing AI's share of national energy consumption.

“The precious few numbers that we have may shed a tiny sliver of light on where we stand right now, but all bets are off in the coming years,” says Luccioni.

Every researcher we spoke to said that we cannot understand the energy demands of this future by simply extrapolating from the energy used in AI queries today. And indeed, the moves by leading AI companies to fire up nuclear power plants and create data centers of unprecedented scale suggest that their vision for the future would consume far more energy than even a large number of these individual queries.

“The precious few numbers that we have may shed a tiny sliver of light on where we stand right now, but all bets are off in the coming years,” says Luccioni. “Generative AI tools are getting practically shoved down our throats and it's getting harder and harder to opt out, or to make informed choices when it comes to energy and climate.”

To understand how much power this AI revolution will need, and where it will come from, we have to read between the lines.

A report published in December by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which is funded by the Department of Energy and has produced 16 Nobel Prizes, attempted to measure what AI's proliferation might mean for energy demand.

In analyzing both public and proprietary data about data centers as a whole, as well as the specific needs of AI, the researchers came to a clear conclusion. Data centers in the US used somewhere around 200 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, roughly what it takes to power Thailand for a year. AI-specific servers in these data centers are estimated to have used between 53 and 76 terawatt-hours of electricity. On the high end, this is enough to power more than 7.2 million US homes for a year.

If we imagine the bulk of that was used for inference, it means enough electricity was used on AI in the US last year for every person on Earth to have exchanged more than 4,000 messages with chatbots. In reality, of course, average individual users aren't responsible for all this power demand. Much of it is likely going toward startups and tech giants testing their models, power users exploring every new feature, and energy-heavy tasks like generating videos or avatars.

Data centers in the US used somewhere around 200 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, roughly what it takes to power Thailand for a year.

By 2028, the researchers estimate, the power going to AI-specific purposes will rise to between 165 and 326 terawatt-hours per year. That's more than all electricity currently used by US data centers for all purposes; it's enough to power 22% of US households each year. That could generate the same emissions as driving over 300 billion miles—over 1,600 round trips to the sun from Earth.

The researchers were clear that adoption of AI and the accelerated server technologies that power it has been the primary force causing electricity demand from data centers to skyrocket after remaining stagnant for over a decade. Between 2024 and 2028, the share of US electricity going to data centers may triple, from its current 4.4% to 12%.

This unprecedented surge in power demand for AI is in line with what leading companies are announcing. SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle, and the Emirati investment firm MGX intend to spend $500 billion in the next four years on new data centers in the US. The first has started construction in Abilene, Texas, and includes eight buildings that are each the size of a baseball stadium. In response to a White House request for information, Anthropic suggested that the US build an additional 50 gigawatts of dedicated power by 2027.

AI companies are also planning multi-gigawatt constructions abroad, including in Malaysia, which is becoming Southeast Asia's data center hub. In May OpenAI announced a plan to support data-center buildouts abroad as part of a bid to “spread democratic AI.” Companies are taking a scattershot approach to getting there—inking deals for new nuclear plants, firing up old ones, and striking massive deals with utility companies.

MIT Technology Review sought interviews with Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft about their plans for this future, and for specific figures on the energy required to inference leading AI models. OpenAI declined to provide figures or make anyone available for an interview but provided a statement saying that it prioritizes efficient use of computing resources and collaborates with partners to support sustainability goals, and that AI might help discover climate solutions. The company said early sites for its Stargate initiative will be natural gas and solar powered and that the company will look to include nuclear and geothermal wherever possible.

Microsoft discussed its own research on improving AI efficiencies but declined to share specifics of how these approaches are incorporated into its data centers.

Google declined to share numbers detailing how much energy is required at inference time for its AI models like Gemini and features like AI Overviews. The company pointed to information about its TPUs—Google's proprietary equivalent of GPUs—and the efficiencies they've gained.

The Lawrence Berkeley researchers offered a blunt critique of where things stand, saying that the information disclosed by tech companies, data center operators, utility companies, and hardware manufacturers is simply not enough to make reasonable projections about the unprecedented energy demands of this future or estimate the emissions it will create. They offered ways that companies could disclose more information without violating trade secrets, such as anonymized data-sharing arrangements, but their report acknowledged that the architects of this massive surge in AI data centers have thus far not been transparent, leaving them without the tools to make a plan.

“Along with limiting the scope of this report, this lack of transparency highlights that data center growth is occurring with little consideration for how best to integrate these emergent loads with the expansion of electricity generation/transmission or for broader community development,” they wrote. The authors also noted that only two other reports of this kind have been released in the last 20 years.

We heard from several other researchers who say that their ability to understand the emissions and energy demands of AI are hampered by the fact that AI is not yet treated as its own sector. The US Energy Information Administration, for example, makes projections and measurements for manufacturing, mining, construction, and agriculture, but detailed data about AI is simply nonexistent.

“Why should we be paying for this infrastructure? Why should we be paying for their power bills?”

Individuals may end up footing some of the bill for this AI revolution, according to new research published in March. The researchers, from Harvard's Electricity Law Initiative, analyzed agreements between utility companies and tech giants like Meta that govern how much those companies will pay for power in massive new data centers. They found that discounts utility companies give to Big Tech can raise the electricity rates paid by consumers. In some cases, if certain data centers fail to attract the promised AI business or need less power than expected, ratepayers could still be on the hook for subsidizing them. A 2024 report from the Virginia legislature estimated that average residential ratepayers in the state could pay an additional $37.50 every month in data center energy costs.

“It's not clear to us that the benefits of these data centers outweigh these costs,” says Eliza Martin, a legal fellow at the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard and a coauthor of the research. “Why should we be paying for this infrastructure? Why should we be paying for their power bills?”

When you ask an AI model to write you a joke or generate a video of a puppy, that query comes with a small but measurable energy toll and an associated amount of emissions spewed into the atmosphere. Given that each individual request often uses less energy than running a kitchen appliance for a few moments, it may seem insignificant.

But as more of us turn to AI tools, these impacts start to add up. And increasingly, you don't need to go looking to use AI: It's being integrated into every corner of our digital lives.

Crucially, there's a lot we don't know; tech giants are largely keeping quiet about the details. But to judge from our estimates, it's clear that AI is a force reshaping not just technology but the power grid and the world around us.

We owe a special thanks to Jae-Won Chung, Mosharaf Chowdhury, and Sasha Luccioni, who shared their measurements of AI's energy use for this project.

MSI has AMD and Intel handhelds now.

MSI brought its first gaming handheld with an AMD chip inside, the Claw A8 BZ2EM, to Computex. The company also used Taipei tradeshow to launch the latest versions of its Crosshair and Cyborg laptops.

MSI's previous gaming handhelds, like its Claw 8 AI+, used Intel's Core Ultra processors — the only mainstream gaming company to do so. It doesn't seem that MSI is abandoning Intel, but is now making systems with chips from both partners.

Beyond using AMD's Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, the Claw A8 will have other new features. The system, which is very green, has an Xbox-style controller layout, placing the right thumbstick below the A/B/X/Y buttons. MSI is using Hall Effect joysticks, which should help prevent stick drift. The Claw A8 also has Hall Effect sensors in the LT and RT triggers.The company has rounded the corners and put in bigger grips, which should increase comfort over previous Claw systems.

The option for up to 24GB of RAM is impressive (especially fast LPDDR5x-8000 memory), but MSI hasn't said anything about what configurations will go to which markets, so we'll see how systems launch with that much memory. Asus used 24GB of memory in the ROG Ally X, one of the best PC Gaming Handhelds, which benefitted because the CPU and GPU share memory.



The 80 WHr battery on the Claw is also identical in capacity to the Ally X, which lasted far longer than the original ROG Ally with a smaller 40 WHr battery.The top of the system features plenty of ports, including a headphone jack, microSD card reader, two USB 4 Type-C ports, as well as a volume rocker and a power button with a built-in fingerprint reader. While the microSD card reader is expected at this point, MSI is also using a standard M.2 2280 SSD, so in theory you could easily crack the system open and replace it with a standard-sized M.2 drive. MSI has refreshed its MSI Center software to be accessible via Xbox Game Bar. This should take up less space and allow for extra customization, but it's still building on top of Windows 11, which hasn't proven to be the most intuitive operating system for gaming handhelds.MSI hasn't announced pricing or a release date for the Claw A8.

Like Acer and Asus, MSI brought its mid-range gaming notebooks to Computex, upgrading them to Nvidia's new RTX 5060 and the RTX 5070.



The new Crosshairs will come in 16, 17, and 18-inch sizes. Confusingly enough, using the 18-inchers as examples, the Intel models are styled Crosshair 18 HX AI, while the AMD versions are Crosshair A18HX. So AI means Intel Core Ultra 200 HX chips here, while the A-series systems use AMD Ryzen 8000.

Other than that, the systems have a ton of commonalities. They all use Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 or RTX 5060 GPUs "and below" (whether that means an upcoming RTX 5050 or older generation chips remains to be seen) and go up to 115W on the GPU and 170W on the CPU. All of the systems have 90 WHr batteries, Wi-Fi 6E, and 2560 x 1600, 240 Hz screens.MSI only sent along configurations for the Crosshair 18HX AI, which will start at $1,699 at Costco and features a Core Ultra 9 275HX, Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. For $2,049, you'll be able to get 64GB of RAM.

MSI hasn't detailed full specifications, so while we know Intel will have slightly faster RAM, we don't know how much RAM many of these systems will ship with. We do know that they have a MUX switch on the motherboard, new crosshair logos on the hinge and touchpad, and, on the 18-inchers, a 24-zone RGB keyboard. MSI didn't provide pricing or release information for these systems.



There's also a refresh to the Cyborg line, which comes in 15 and 17-inch sizes. These systems use translucent plastic on the edges but still have a metal lid. The Cyborg 15 and Cyborg 17 will use Intel Core 200H chips and RTX 5060, 5070, "and below" graphics cards, while the Cyborg A15 AI and A17 AI (yes, here AI stands for AMD), will opt for Ryzen 200 series processors. The 15-inch screens come in either 1080p at 144 Hz or 1440p at 165 Hz. if you opt for 17 inches, MSI has gone for a 1080p/144 Hz screen or a 1440p, 240 Hz option. Again, we only have partial pricing here, and no availability. The Cyborg A15 AI will start at $1,149 at Costco with a Ryzen 7 260, RTX 5050 (which we were surprised to see in a sheet sent to press), 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. For $1,399 at Best Buy, you can go up to a Ryzen 9 270 and RTX 5060. The 17-inch AMD model will be $1,549 at Costco with the Ryzen 9 270, RTX 5060, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. MSI's other Computex announcements include some productivity laptops, including a new Stealth A16 AI+ and Prestige 16 AI+ notebook that further MSI's partnership with AMG Motorsport. Additionally, there's a new Prestige 13 AI+ "Ukiyuo-e Edition," a limited edition showcasing "The Great Wave off Kanagawa" that will be individually crafted by artists.

Editor's Note:The Case Challenge series includes difficult-to-diagnose conditions, some of which are not frequently encountered by most clinicians, but are nonetheless important to accurately recognize. Test your diagnostic and treatment skills using the following patient scenario and corresponding questions. If you have a case that you would like to suggest for a future Case Challenge, please email us at ccsuggestions@medscape.com with the subject line "Case Challenge Suggestion." We look forward to hearing from you.

A 13-year-old boy presents to the emergency department (ED) with a history of epigastric pain, vomiting, malaise, polyuria, and a 12-lb weight loss during the past 3 months. His parents have brought him to the emergency department today because his pain and vomiting are worsening. They report no history of hematuria, hematemesis, fever, or chills. They also do not note any other associated symptoms, prior surgeries, or medical conditions.

The patient was previously seen by his pediatrician and is undergoing a workup. Upper gastroendoscopy performed at a nearby hospital 2 weeks ago had revealed chronic gastritis with erosive changes in the antral region. Triple treatment for Helicobacter pylori, however, did not lead to any improvement. Abdominal ultrasonography also performed at that time showed mild nephrocalcinosis. Family history is negative for diabetes mellitus and porphyria.

Upon physical examination, the child is thin and mildly ill-appearing. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C); his pulse has a regular rhythm, with a rate of 80 beats/min; and his blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. The patient's respirations are regular and unlabored at 14 breaths/min.

The child is in mild distress secondary to his epigastric discomfort. The examination of the head and neck is normal, except that the oropharynx appears slightly dry. He has no dysmorphic facial features. His lungs are clear to auscultation, and normal respiratory effort is noted. The S1 and S2 heart sounds are normal, and no murmurs are detected. The abdomen is soft but tender to deep palpation in the epigastric region. The patient's extremities show no edema, and brisk capillary refill is noted. His skin is clear except in the gluteal region, where a nodular eczematous lesion is present. Routine laboratory tests reveal a normal complete blood count and normal values for sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, and magnesium. The patient's blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine values are elevated (22.4 mg/dL and 1.8 mg/dL, respectively). The calcium level is elevated at 14.4 mg/dL, which is confirmed with an ionized calcium level of 7.2 mg/dL. The phosphorus level is low, at 5 mg/dL. Hepatic aminotransferase values are slightly elevated (aspartate aminotransferase, 61 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 201 U/L) and the bilirubin level is 0.7 mg/dL. Alkaline phosphatase level is somewhat elevated at 137 IU/L. A chest radiograph is obtained (Figure).

Figure. Chest radiograph demonstrating combined hilar lymphadenopathy and reticulonodular interstitial infiltrates in the upper lung zone. (Note: This image is from a different patient with a similar condition.)

The patient is hospitalized. During the hospital course, additional laboratory tests are performed. The thyroid hormone levels are in the normal range, but the parathyroid hormone level is low, at 10.91 pg/mL (normal range, 15-65 pg/mL). Vitamin D metabolites are not measured. The serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level is normal, at 32.7 U/L (normal range, 12-42 U/L). The results of a purified protein derivative test are negative. Urinalysis performed on several occasions shows a specific gravity of 1.003 and a pH of 5, with normal urinary sediment. Urinary culture findings are negative. On several occasions, marked hypercalciuria is observed, with a calcium level of 14 mg/kg and a urinary calcium/creatinine ratio (mmol/mmol) that ranges from 2.5 to 3.5. No glycosuria or aminoaciduria is noted.

Ultrasonography is performed, on which the parathyroid glands appear normal. Renal ultrasonography confirms mild nephrocalcinosis around the renal calices. A renal biopsy is performed. The specimen exhibits tubulointerstitial nephritis associated with tubular calcium deposits. 

Other findings include interstitial infiltration by mononuclear cells, interstitial fibrosis, tubular necrosis, and atrophy. Dystrophic calcifications are present in some of the tubules.

Negative results are obtained for immunoglobulin (Ig) A, IgG, IgM, and C3 on immunofluorescence analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals inflammatory cellular substrate CD68, macrophages, and lymphoid population. No glomerular abnormalities are evident.

The clinical picture of this patient was dominated by nonspecific constitutional symptoms, such as malaise, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and weight loss. He had no history of maculopapular rashes, erythema nodosum, arthritis, chronic lymphocytopenia, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or uveitis. He also did not have any coughing or exertional dyspnea. The child did have vomiting and polyuria, which were caused by hypercalcemia.

The renal biopsy specimen indicated acute tubulointerstitial nephritis associated with tubular calcium deposits, without glomerular abnormalities. In addition, the chest radiograph demonstrated combined hilar lymphadenopathy and reticulonodular interstitial infiltrates in the upper lung zone. The chest radiography findings, when considered along with the hypercalcemia, rash, and renal biopsy results, are consistent with stage 2 radiographic sarcoidosis.[1]

Symptoms of Fanconi syndrome in children are failure to thrive, growth retardation, and rickets, which does not describe this patient. Diagnosis is by demonstrating glucosuria, phosphaturia, and aminoaciduria.[2]

Although a variety of glomerular lesions, including IgA nephropathy, are described as glomerular damage in sarcoidosis, they are not distinguishable from their primary form.[3] Moreover, this patient has a tubulointerstitial nephritis which is seen more often in sarcoidosis than IgA nephropathy (the latter is typically more a glomerulonephritis).

Bartter syndrome, a rare inherited salt-losing renal tubular disorder, is associated with secondary hyperaldosteronism with hypokalemic and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis and low to normal blood pressure,[4] which does not describe this patient.

Hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria may occur in less than a third of cases of pediatric sarcoidosis.[1] Measuring baseline serum calcium levels is recommended to screen for abnormal calcium metabolism in patients with sarcoidosis, even in asymptomatic patients.[5]

A rare cause of clinically manifested hypercalcemia is vitamin D intoxication, but it is associated with significant morbidity. It may be caused by endogenous synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D from subcutaneous fat necrosis, granulomatous disease, or by excessive exogenous vitamin D intake.[1] Hypercalcemia may also result from primary hyperparathyroidism or from increased levels of parathyroid hormone-related protein caused by certain malignancies.[6] Lastly, hypercalcemia may occur in patients with hypophosphatemia, vitamin A intoxication, or blue-diaper syndrome, or it may occur in association with use of certain medications, most notably hydrochlorothiazide and other thiazide diuretics.[6]

An intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level at the time of hypercalcemia is pivotal in narrowing the differential diagnosis. If the PTH level is high, the child must be thoroughly investigated for the cause of hyperparathyroidism and may require urgent surgical intervention. If the PTH level is low (as it was in this patient), additional calciotropic hormones may be assayed if appropriate testing is available. Identifying the abnormal calciotropic hormone might allow diagnosis of the specific cause, elucidation of the mechanism for the hypercalcemia, and optimal treatment.[7]

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder characterized by an increased cellular immune response to an unknown antigen and the formation of noncaseating granulomas in affected tissues. Although the lungs and lymph nodes are the predominant sites affected by sarcoidosis, other organs, such as the eyes, bone marrow, kidneys, liver, and spleen, may also be involved.[1,8] Cases of extrapulmonary sarcoidosis affecting the kidneys are rare; most such cases present with nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis. Renal failure is an extremely uncommon manifestation.[1]

As noted previously, an intact PTH level at the time of hypercalcemia is important in narrowing the differential diagnosis. If the PTH level is high, the child must be completely investigated for the cause of hyperparathyroidism and may need urgent surgery. If the PTH level is low (as it was in this patient), additional calciotropic hormones may be examined if appropriate testing is available. Identification of the abnormal calciotropic hormone might facilitate diagnosis of the cause, clarification of the mechanism for the hypercalcemia, and appropriate treatment.[7]

Hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis is relatively uncommon.[1] It is usually caused by the autonomous production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) by macrophages within the granuloma. These macrophages can convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D, produced by the liver, into calcitriol by possessing the 1-alpha-hydroxylase enzyme. Calcitriol then travels to the intestinal cells and promotes luminal absorption of calcium and phosphate into the circulation. Hypercalcemia is accompanied by hypercalciuria and, eventually, nephrocalcinosis (as seen in this case). Hypercalcemia may also eventually cause renal failure both by causing dehydration and by inducing renal vasoconstriction, thereby reducing the glomerular filtration rate.[1,6]

Excess PTH production can produce significant bone loss, which is not seen in this patient.[7] High levels of magnesium are not directly linked to sarcoidosis.

The lungs and lymph nodes are the predominant sites that are affected by sarcoidosis,[9] and also the liver in children,[8] although other organs, including the eyes, bone marrow, kidneys, and spleen, may additionally be involved.[1,8,9]

Pediatric sarcoidosis is a rare disease, with an estimated incidence of 0.6 to 1.02 per 100,000 children.[8] Two distinct forms of childhood sarcoidosis appear to exist. Older children usually present with a multisystem disease similar to the adult manifestation, with frequent lymphadenopathy and pulmonary involvement. They also show generalized signs and symptoms, such as fever and malaise. In contrast, early-onset childhood sarcoidosis is a unique form of the disease characterized by the triad of rash, uveitis, and arthritis, usually in patients who are younger than 4 years.[9]

Pulmonary disease and abnormal findings on chest radiography are more common in children with sarcoidosis aged 8-15 years, compared with those younger than 4 years.[9] Bilateral hilar adenopathy is the most common finding on chest radiography in children; it occurs in almost all cases. It is typically symmetrical, although rarely it may occur unilaterally. Pulmonary parenchymal involvement is common and most often appears radiographically as an interstitial pattern; however, nodular, alveolar, and fibrotic patterns have also been noted. Of note, although chest radiography may be sufficient for the diagnosis, high-resolution chest CT may be helpful in evaluating lung changes[1,9] and is superior to conventional CT for detecting and demonstrating diagnostic findings in the lungs.[10]

Other uncommon manifestations include pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pleural thickening, calcification, and cor pulmonale, and atelectasis.[1] The serum ACE level is increased in many patients with sarcoidosis. Sensitivity and specificity as a diagnostic test is limited. The serum ACE level may be normal in patients with active disease.[9]

Many children with sarcoidosis have palpable peripheral lymph glands. The lymph nodes generally are firm, nontender, discrete, and easily movable. They neither ulcerate nor form draining sinuses. The glands involved most often are the cervical, axillary, epitrochlear, and inguinal glands. In the neck, the posterior triangle nodes are affected more frequently than the nodes in the anterior triangle. The enlarged peripheral lymph nodes are the most accessible tissue for biopsy. Hepatosplenomegaly often occurs in children with sarcoidosis at some point in their clinical course, but clinically significant hepatic dysfunction is rare. Mild elevation in biochemical liver function test values is common (as it was in this patient), but severe liver involvement is uncommon in children.[9]

Ocular involvement is very common in children with sarcoidosis, and a complete ophthalmologic evaluation, including a slit-lamp examination, is essential (particularly in young children). Sarcoidosis may affect any part of the eye or orbit. Anterior uveitis (also called "iritis" or "iridocyclitis") is the most frequently noted lesion.[9] The patient should be examined for a decrease in visual acuity, eye pain, a red eye, or any other visual aberration that can indicate a posterior or anterior uveitis.[8]

Sarcoid-associated uveitis can be acute or chronic and may vary from an isolated iridocyclitis to a bilateral panuveitis syndrome. If left untreated, the disease may cause synechiae, corneal opacities, glaucoma, and, eventually, blindness.[1,9]

Renal involvement is not well characterized in published series of childhood sarcoidosis. Histopathologic studies have revealed epithelioid granuloma formation, interstitial infiltration by mononuclear cells, interstitial fibrosis, tubulitis, tubular atrophy, mesangial hyperplasia, glomerular fibrosis, and vascular involvement.[9]

Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of therapy for sarcoidosis, but immunosuppressive, cytotoxic, and immunomodulatory agents are viable therapeutic options for patients who do not respond to or experience adverse effects from corticosteroids. The published data most extensively documents treatment with methotrexate,[1,8] but favorable responses have been noted with leflunomide, azathioprine, and antimalarial and antimicrobial agents, as well as with tumor necrosis factor–alpha inhibitors. The dosage and the duration of corticosteroid therapy must often be individualized. Treatment is continued until the clinical manifestations of the disease resolve or show significant improvement.[9,11] For cutaneous sarcoidosis that cannot be controlled by local treatment, consideration of oral glucocorticoids is suggested.[11 More recently, repository corticotropin injection been suggested as an alternative in patients who are on high-dose prednisone.[9]

The patient in this case received prednisone, 1.5 mg/kg per day for 1 month, with gradual tapering of the dose over the following 4-5 months. Hypercalcemia and renal failure reversed completely, as did the pulmonary changes seen on radiography.

No recurrence was observed at 1-year follow-up. Renal nephrocalcinosis persisted, however, despite symptomatic and biochemical improvement. During corticosteroid therapy, measurement of the urinary beta-2-microglobulin concentration by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis proved a valuable monitoring tool for assessing recovery of the tubular impairment.

Chest radiography obtained after 3 weeks of corticosteroid therapy showed resolution of the findings seen in the original chest radiograph.

This patient represents a rare case of sarcoidosis presenting with acute renal failure and hypercalcemia as the initial manifestations. Sarcoidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia and renal failure,[1,9] occurring singly or in combination. Corticosteroids are useful for treatment.[1,8,9]

As noted previously, hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis is uncommon[1] and usually results from autonomous production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) by macrophages within the granuloma. These macrophages can convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D, produced by the liver, into calcitriol by possessing the 1-alpha-hydroxylase enzyme. At that point, calcitriol travels to the intestinal cells and facilitates luminal absorption of calcium and phosphate into the circulation. Hypercalcemia is accompanied by hypercalciuria and, eventually, nephrocalcinosis.[1,6,9]

A rare cause of clinically manifested hypercalcemia is vitamin D intoxication, which may be caused by excessive exogenous vitamin D intake.[1,6,9]

Hypercalcemia may also result from primary hyperparathyroidism or from increased levels of parathyroid hormone-related protein caused by certain malignancies.[1,6,9]

As noted previously, corticosteroids are the cornerstone of therapy for sarcoidosis,[1,9] but viable therapeutic options include immunosuppressive, cytotoxic, and immunomodulatory agents for patients who do not respond to or experience adverse effects from corticosteroids. Published data mainly documents treatment with the immunosuppressant methotrexate,[1,8] but favorable responses have been seen with leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and antimalarial and antimicrobial agents, as well as with tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors. Treatment options do not include fungicides, antiviral drugs, and antibiotics; granulomatous pulmonary infections caused by mycobacteria and fungi should have been ruled out.[1] For cutaneous sarcoidosis that is not controlled by local treatment, oral glucocorticoids could be considered.[11] For patients on high-dose prednisone, a suggested alternative is repository corticotropin injection.[9] The dosage and the duration of corticosteroid therapy must often be individualized. The treatment is continued until the clinical manifestations of the disease resolve or show significant improvement.[9,11]

 May 20, 2025  

A regimen that spares patients recovering from cataract surgery the burden of using antibacterial and anti-inflammatory eye drops several times a day for weeks and instead uses an injection to administer those drugs immediately after the procedure is nearly as effective at preventing complications as the traditional drop regimen at a fraction of the cost, a study of both approaches found.

“Our study aims to underscore the benefits of the dropless cataract surgery approach as a promising alternative to the traditional drop regimen, particularly for populations where adherence to postoperative drops is challenging,” Yousef Yousef, a medical student at the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Buffalo, New York, told Medscape Medical News. “We hope our findings will encourage broader adoption of the dropless protocol by cataract surgeons, potentially establishing it as a new standard of care.”

Yousef presented results from a retrospective chart review of 544 eyes that had cataract surgery at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) 2025 Annual Meeting in Salt Lake City.

The traditional protocol, used in 265 study eyes, consisted of giving patients a prescription for drops of the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid prednisolone 1%, the antibiotic moxifloxacin 0.5%, and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ketorolac 0.5% four times a day with a 4-week taper. The dropless protocol, assigned to 279 eyes, consisted of an intracameral injection of 0.2 mL of moxifloxacin 0.5% and a 10 mg/mL subconjunctival injection of the glucocorticoid triamcinolone (Kenalog) on completion of the operation.

The researchers found no significant differences in best-corrected visual acuity. Patients who had the dropless protocol had a higher incidence of cystoid macular edema — 5% vs 1% — Yousef said, but the incidence of ocular hypertension was not statistically significant between the two groups (2% vs 1%). A multivariate regression analysis showed the dropless protocol was not associated with increased risks for either complication, he added.

The dropless protocol has three key potential advantages over the traditional approach, Yousef said: Convenience for patients, improved drug bioavailability, and lower cost.

“The traditional drop protocol requires patients to administer three different medications four times daily over a 4-week tapering period,” he told Medscape Medical News. “This regimen results in a total of 12 drops per day for one eye and 210 drops over the course of the taper.”

Poor drug bioavailability is a “significant concern” with topical drops, Yousef said, because the epithelial membrane of the cornea can limit the ability of the drops from penetrating into the eye. “Intracameral injection bypasses these barriers, delivering a more direct treatment,” he said.

A 2020 analysis of Medicare claims reported the average cost of medications for eye drops after cataract surgery was $228 per eye. “Notably, 76.5% of this total cost was attributed to the use of brand-name medications,” Yousef said. “In contrast, the dropless approach costs just $15.91 per eye when a single vial is used for approximately 10 cases.”

The new data are important because few randomized clinical trials have compared the dropless and traditional protocols for treating pain and inflammation and preventing infections after cataract surgery, according to Neal Shorstein, MD, a retired cataract surgeon with Kaiser Permanente in Northern California.

“There are an accumulating number of observational studies, so this adds to the retrospective, observational literature, and that's a good thing because different locations and practice environments add to the experience,” said Shorstein, an adviser to the Seva Foundation, a nonprofit group that develops eye care programs in underserved regions.

The doses of medication used in the dropless protocol in the analysis are higher than what others have reported. The 0.2 mL of intracameral moxifloxacin 0.5% is “about the upper limits of what you want to inject of moxifloxacin.” The 0.5-mL dose of subconjunctival triamcinolone is, “in my estimation, a good dose.”

The formulation of triamcinolone used has a large particle size, which “matters a lot because the safety and effectiveness of triamcinolone depends on the particle size,” he said. Triesence, another formulation of triamcinolone used in some dropless protocols, has a smaller particle size, he said.

The entry point on the conjunctiva for the triamcinolone injection is another important factor, Shorstein added. “Our findings show that 6-8 mm from the limbus is the optimal location,” he said.

The study was independently supported. Yousef and Shorstein reported having no relevant financial relationships.

A combination of two drugs could improve outcomes and reduce the need for toxic chemotherapy for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), the commonest cancer in childhood and one that can be particularly difficult to treat in older patients, according to Cambridge scientists.

Although the research has so far only been conducted in cell lines and mice, the team is seeking funding to begin clinical trials in patients shortly.

More than 500 people a year in the UK are diagnosed with B-ALL, many of whom are children, where it makes up 40% of all childhood cancers. Although the disease is curable in the majority of younger patients, the treatment requires over two years of chemotherapy, leaving the patient susceptible to infections and experiencing toxic side effects including bruising and bleeding, hair loss, nausea and vomiting, as well as potential long-term damage notably to nerves, joints and the heart. Outcomes tend to be much poorer for older children and adults.

Every week, I see adult patients who are undergoing treatment for this incredibly aggressive form of leukemia, and although the chemotherapy can cure many of them, the side effects are often really challenging. We need to find treatments that are kinder and more effective."

Dr. Simon Richardson from the Cambridge Stem Cell Institute and Department of Hematology, University of Cambridge

In recent years, new treatments have begun to emerge, including bone marrow transplants and immunotherapies such as CAR-T cell therapy, but these also come with significant side effects and are expensive.

Now, in research published today in Nature Communications, a team led by Dr Richardson and colleague Professor Brian Huntly has developed a new treatment with the potential to be less toxic than current treatment and to be effective in all age groups.

B-ALL is characterised by malignancies of early-stage B-cells. These are cells produced in our bone marrow that play an important role in our immune systems, producing antibodies to protect us from infection. However, in B-ALL, the body produces an overabundance of these cells that build up in our bone marrow and stop healthy blood cells from developing. They can also spread to other parts of the body.

"There's a constant stream of these cells coming out through the bone marrow into the immune system," said Dr Richardson. "The ones that cause cancer are very primitive and not yet useful. They build up in the bone marrow and then often move around the body, such as invading into the brain where they can hide from chemotherapy. It's a really nasty kind of cancer."

Treatments for B-ALL focus on killing these malignant B-cells. The approach being trialled by the team at the Cambridge Stem Cell Institute involves the use of two oral drugs in tandem, venetoclax and inobrodib.

Venetoclax is already used to treat a related condition, acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It works by targeting the protein BCL2 within the B-cells, causing them to die through a process of 'programmed cell death' known as apoptosis. However, venetoclax is not consistently effective in B-ALL.

The team was studying another gene called CREBBP, certain mutations of which contribute to disease progression and are also associated with resistance to chemotherapy in B-ALL. They found that when CREBBP is switched off, it leads to a rewiring of the fat metabolism of B-cells. When BCL2 activity is subsequently inhibited – for example by using venetoclax – it leads to cell death, but by a completely different process known as ferroptotic programmed cell death. This is where the cells are no longer able to protect themselves against damage to the fats in their membranes, causing the cells to become overwhelmed and break down.

The researchers used a new drug called inobrodib, developed by CellCentric, a University of Cambridge spinout company, to switch off CREBBP in human and mouse models of B-ALL. Combining it with venetoclax potently killed early-stage B-cells, even those cells that carried a genetic mutation making them resistant to venetoclax treatment alone.

Professor Brian Huntly, also from the Cambridge Stem Cell Institute and Head of the Department of Haematology, said: "These are very promising findings, and even though our work was only in mice, we're optimistic that we will see similar effects in patients. Venetoclax and inobrodib have already been used together in an early-stage clinical trial for AML, so we know they are safe to use. We now want to trial our approach in adults and teenagers with B-ALL."

B-cells are a vital part of the immune system, and although this drug combination will destroy the cells while the patient is on treatment, the body should begin producing them again once treatment is stopped. This makes this approach potentially much safer than CAR-T cell therapy, for example, which can permanently eradicate the body's ability to produce B-cells.

Dr. Richardson, who is also a Fellow at St. Catharine's College, Cambridge, added: "The good news is that the cost of venetoclax is expected to fall in coming years with the introduction of generic alternatives, making its use much more cost effective."

Professor Huntly and Dr Richardson are Honorary Consultant Hematologists at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. Professor Huntly is Chair of the Haematology Service at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

The research was largely funded by Cancer Research UK and Leukemia UK.

The University of Cambridge and Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust (ACT) are fundraising for a new hospital that will transform how we diagnose and treat cancer. Cambridge Cancer Research Hospital, a partnership with Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, will treat patients across the East of England, but the research that takes place there promises to change the lives of cancer patients across the UK and beyond. .

Gill Murphy was on extended maternity leave, aged 42, and her daughter had just turned two when her friend convinced her to speak to her GP about feeling excessively tired.

"I'm very pale anyway, thanks to my Irish Heritage, but the GP thought I look particularly pale," she says, "so she ordered a blood test. She thought it might be low iron or anaemia."

It turned out to be far more serious – Gill would be diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). She went into hospital in August 2013 for what she assumed would be an overnight stay. It turned out to be five-and-a-half weeks of chemotherapy.

Prior to her treatment, Gill had been a biomedical researcher studying tumour-suppressing proteins before becoming a programme manager at the Medical Research Council. She knew all about clinical trials – including the fact that patients on trials seem to fare better even when receiving only the placebo – and so requested she join one. She was enrolled onto a trial at the Royal Marsden Hospital, one of the UK's leading cancer hospitals, where she received treatment.

Gill was given chemotherapy alongside rituximab, a trial immunotherapy drug. Chemo drugs can attack every part of your body, not just the cancer. The side effects were terrible, she says, from vomiting and diarrhoea (giving way to horrific constipation) to migraines, hair loss and fatigue. Because she was immunosuppressed, she was unable at times to see her daughter, who developed infections after just starting nursery.

After her first round of chemo, Gill would come home for a week before returning to hospital for more treatment in an ongoing cycle, giving countless blood samples, bone marrow biopsies and lumbar puncture tests and receiving regular chemotherapy into her spine. (The one bright spot, she says, was the steroid dexamethasone, which "can make you feel an awful lot better than you should. So, while my husband was trying to cope with everything at home, with our two-year-old and short working days, I was busy planning a kitchen extension from my hospital bed and overwhelming him with my plans!")

Because of the genetics underlying her leukemia, her medical team recommended a stem cell transplant. With her background in medical research, she knew this was a risky procedure and that she could die as result of the transplant or her blood cancer relapsing – and that even if successful, it was going to make her very ill.

"I'd been quite stoic when I was first diagnosed. I treated it as a project, like, 'Right, you've got to get rid of this cancer'. The longer it went on, the more scared I got. There were a lot of sleepless nights, when I just got out of bed and went and had a cup of hot milk with the nurses. It was really hard."

The treatments Gill received in preparation for the donor stem cell transplant were particularly harsh, she says, probably the worst she felt through the entire process. And then after the treatment, she had to take immunosuppressants to prevent the stem cells turning her immune system against her. There were frequent trips back to the hospital because she was unable to keep food down. She was constantly freezing, wearing layers of coats and cardigans and blankets and a bobble hat at night.

"I remember lying in bed looking through the blinds when I was at home and marking the days by looking at how late the streetlights were coming on, because I was thinking, 'Every day I'm going to get a bit better'."

It worked: the transplant was a success and Gill's leukemia is now in remission.

"I was very lucky. I had a really, really good donor match. I still don't know who my donor is, but I'm so grateful to them for signing up to do something so altruistic. There's no doubt that they saved my life."

Even so, Gill's life has not returned to normal. It has become what many cancer survivors describe as a "new normal". She is still affected by fatigue – not tiredness, but rather a sense of "hitting a wall" if she pushes herself too hard (though she says she can "sleep for every country in the world, not just for England"). Other later side effects have included early menopause, steroid-induced diabetes, cataracts, osteomyelitis in both lower legs and a susceptibility to infections. She believes her cognition and memory have also taken a hit.

Yet despite this, Gill has found a new life as an ambassador for Blood Cancer UK, talking to other patients, researchers and politicians about ALL, sitting on interview panels for the charity, advising on its five-year strategy, and many more tasks.

"We [cancer survivors] all say we want to give something back, but it's true. I've gained more from being involved with Blood Cancer UK as an ambassador than anything I've ever done before."

She has also taken on walking challenges to raise money for Blood Cancer UK, Anthony Nolan and the Royal Marsden: three charities that have helped her immensely over the years.

Gill says that despite how terrible her treatment was, she knows that others have experienced much worse. But she is also keen to stress that in the 12 years since her treatment, things have improved and there are better treatments now available.

"The doctors I meet all want to see kinder, more targeted treatments," she says. "Anything that we can do to improve treatments so more people can survive their blood cancer and fewer people have to go through incredibly harsh therapies is a win-win.".

A drug used to treat type 2 diabetes may also be effective in slowing the progression of prostate cancer. This is shown by an international study in which researchers at Umeå University, Sweden, have participated. The researchers have found that drugs that regulate a particular protein have a key role in reducing prostate cancer recurrence among diabetic patients.

This is a significant discovery. For the first time, we have clinical observations showing that prostate cancer patients with diabetes who received drugs targeting the protein remained relapse-free during the period we followed them."

Lukas Kenner, visiting professor at Umeå University and one of the study's lead authors

The protein that the researchers have studied is called PPARy, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. In diabetes research, PPARy has been extensively studied in view of the protein's role in metabolic processes and insulin sensitivity.

What the research team, led by Professor Kenner, has now shown is that patients who were treated for prostate cancer and who also had diabetes, who were treated with drugs that regulate the PPARy protein, managed without recurrence of prostate cancer. In studies of cell cultures, researchers also observed that the drug in question, pioglitazone, not only inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells but also drives a metabolic reprogramming of the cancer cells, weakening their ability to grow.

"The findings are very promising, but further clinical studies are needed to both confirm the results and to investigate whether the treatment can also be used in patients with prostate cancer who do not have diabetes," says Lukas Kenner.

The research has been conducted as a combination of studies on cells and mice as well as a retrospective study of 69 prostate cancer patients with type 2 diabetes that was followed by the Medical University of Innsbruck in 2014–2023.

In certain types of cancer, PPARγ can contribute to tumor growth or metabolic changes. The drug, pioglitazone, is a so-called agonist that binds to a PPARy receptor and activates it. Thereby it modulates the signalling pathway and aims to counteract tumor-promoting effects by changing the cellular metabolism but may also reduce inflammation.

The research group behind the study includes researchers in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Sweden.

 May 20, 2025  

LOS ANGELES — Mood episodes in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) that occur more frequently or severely during specific seasons — known as seasonality patterns — are associated with treatment response and different characteristics and subtypes of the disorder, new research suggested.

In a study of more than 1700 patients with BD, investigators found links between seasonality and age at BD onset, BD type, and lifetime use of antipsychotics and any psychotropics. The findings also showed associations between medication response and fall-winter depression and spring-summer hypomania.

“A take-home message is that people should start to think about seasonality with respect to distinct seasons; it shouldn't just be that a patient has seasonal features or not,” co-investigator Mete Ercis, MD, research fellow in the Department of Psychiatry and Psychology at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, told Medscape Medical News.

Because this was a cross-sectional study, causality cannot be implied, he noted.

“We can say, for example, that people who had early onset of bipolar disorder tended to have higher seasonality, but we cannot say which came first,” Ercis said.

The findings were presented on May 17 at the American Psychiatric Association (APA) 2025 Annual Meeting.

Although about 25% of patients with BD experience seasonality, there is no standardized definition or classification of patterns, and the few studies on the topic have shown mixed findings, researchers noted.

The current study included 1702 patients (mean age, 41.4 years; 62% women) enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Bipolar Disorder Biobank who had data on seasonality.

Of these, 45% had at least one type of seasonality and were divided into one of four groups on the basis of when their prevailing mood episodes occurred: Fall-winter depression, spring-summer hypomania, the first two groups combined (biphasic seasonality), and indeterminate seasonality, used when a patient had seasonality patterns that did not fit the other categories.

Outcomes included having BD type 1, a history of psychosis or suicide attempts, early age of onset (≤ 19 years), rapid cycling, and number of lifetime antidepressants, antipsychotics, and any psychotropics used.

Results showed that any seasonality vs no seasonality was associated with early-onset BD (P = .03), BD type 1 (P = .02), and a higher count of lifetime antipsychotics and any psychotropics (P < .001 for both).

Compared with no seasonality, fall-winter depression was associated with a higher use of lifetime antidepressants (P = .02) and any psychotropic medication (P = .01), and lower Alda A scores for response to lithium (P = .03) and to all mood stabilizers (lithium, lamotrigine, valproate, and carbamazepine; P = .01).

“One thing that was striking was we noticed the treatment resistance to lithium or mood stabilizers were in individuals who had fall-winter depression but not in the other seasonality groups,” Ercis said.

“I was not expecting that, although it makes sense. I thought any seasonality would be associated with treatment resistance, but actually that was not statistically significant,” he added.

Spring-summer hypomania was linked to a lower likelihood of rapid cycling (odds ratio, 0.36; P < .001) and a lower number of lifetime antidepressants used (P = .01).

Higher counts of lifetime antipsychotics and any psychotropics were linked to biphasic seasonality (P = .03 for both) and with indeterminate seasonality (P < .001 for both). Indeterminate seasonality was also associated with having BD type 1 (P = .002), a history of psychosis (P = .03), and early onset (P = .04).

None of the seasonality patterns were significantly associated with a history of suicide attempts.

“These findings underscore the importance of studying how seasonal patterns influence the course and outcomes of BD,” the investigators wrote.

They added that future studies should also explore biologic mechanisms for the underlying seasonality found in the condition.

Commenting for Medscape Medical News, Adrian Preda, MD, professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of California, Irvine, noted that because of the study's design, “obviously you cannot comment on cause and effect.” Instead, the investigators presented correlations, he pointed out.

“They were looking at different types of seasonality, which was interesting because usually we don't separate seasonal bipolar disorder into different subtypes,” said Preda, who was not involved with the research.

He noted that the link between seasonality and a higher count of antipsychotics made him wonder whether patients with seasonality are at risk of receiving more antipsychotic prescriptions, or if greater antipsychotic use is somehow increasing the risk for seasonal episodes. “We can't know that, but it's an interesting finding,” he said.

Preda also noted the compelling associations found between the specific seasonal subtypes and lithium response and cycling. “I think this study has very interesting correlations — but we need to know a little bit more in order to say, ‘This is the cause,'” he concluded.

Ercis and Preda reported having no relevant financial relationships.

The new guidelines for the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) published in Neurodegenerative Diseases, serve as exemplary clinical recommendations for clinicians and healthcare providers, supporting the advancement of Alzheimer's disease treatment in Switzerland.

The Swiss Memory Clinics (SMC) network, a group of specialized clinics in Switzerland that diagnose and treat patients with dementia, has released new national guidelines on the use of anti-amyloid mAbs – such as Lecanemab and Donanemab – for treating Alzheimer's disease in Switzerland. Lecanemab is now also authorized by the European Commission under strict conditions.

Published in the 11 April 2025 issue of Neurodegenerative Diseases, a Karger journal, the paper represents a coordinated effort by the SMC network to ensure safe, effective, and ethical implementation of these emerging therapies. Serving as a clinical practice guide for clinicians and healthcare providers, it facilitates the implementation of emerging treatment options in the field of Alzheimer's disease.

The paper outlines criteria for patient selection, biomarker confirmation, APOE genotyping, ARIA monitoring via MRI, and the infrastructure required to support safe treatment delivery. It also emphasizes the importance of informed consent and recommends the creation of a national patient registry.

The guidelines stem from interdisciplinary discussions between clinicians in the SMC network--neurologists, geriatricians, old-age psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, neuroradiologists, and patient organizations, including representatives of academic and non-academic memory clinics--between August 2023 and December 2024. They provide the first country-specific framework for integrating mAbs into clinical practice.

In a joint statement, lead authors Dr. med Ansgar Felbecker and Professor Giovanni B. Frisoni, commented: “We built an expert group of specialists to provide recommendations in Switzerland on when to use anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies in the care of Alzheimer's disease patients. Our hope is that this guidance will help with the approval of these new drugs in other countries for patients who qualify for this care.”

While the paper provides a country-specific framework for the use of mAbs in clinical routine, the authors hope that as Alzheimer's disease care enters a new therapeutic era, these guidelines can balance innovation with clinical responsibility—offering a model for other nations navigating similar questions.

It is great that the journal Neurodegenerative Diseases serves as a home for such important guidance that has the potential to impact thousands of patients,”

Professor Gilles Allali, Editor in Chief of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Karger Publishers

“The latest guidelines put forward by Swiss experts truly have the potential to transform Alzheimer's disease care across the globe.”

A research team at The University of Osaka has identified a crucial brain region involved in motor learning during reaching movements. The parvocellular division of the red nucleus, a small but specialized structure in the midbrain, was found to generate and transmit "error signals" necessary for adapting hand movements. This discovery clarifies a long-standing question in neuroscience about how the brain detects and corrects motion inaccuracies, with potential applications in developing new rehabilitation methods.

Adaptation in motor control, such as correcting errors when reaching for an object, is fundamental to daily activities. While the cerebellum has long been known to play a role in such learning, the origin of the instructive error signals had remained unclear. The red nucleus, divided into magnocellular (RNm) and parvocellular (RNp) regions, is a subcortical structure historically associated with movement coordination, but the function of RNp has been less understood. Researchers aimed to determine whether this region might be involved in signaling movement errors to the cerebellum.

In macaque monkeys, researchers discovered that a tiny brain region called the parvocellular red nucleus (RNp) sends "error signals" needed to correct reaching movements. These signals come in two forms—one during movement, and one after. When RNp was electrically stimulated just after a reach, the monkeys gradually changed their movement direction, showing learning over time. Stimulating a nearby region (RNm) had no effect, proving RNp's unique role in motor learning.

This research reveals for the first time that the parvocellular red nucleus acts as a central hub for motor error detection and correction, mediating motor learning through its connection to the cerebellum. The findings open new avenues for developing rehabilitation technologies targeting precise brain regions to aid recovery in patients with motor impairments due to stroke or injury. As Shigeru Kitazawa, lead author of the study remarks, "Improving motor skills depends on our ability to detect and correct errors. Identifying how and where the brain performs could also lead to better ways to understand and treat rare brain diseases that make it hard for people to move or control their body properly."

Food cravings are the downfall of many dieters, who feel locked in an eternal battle with their willpower to resist the tempting sweets, snacks and other foods they love.

However, researchers in food science and human nutrition at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign say in a new study that eating dessert may be the optimal strategy for losing weight, keeping it off and keeping cravings at bay. Dieters in a clinical trial who incorporated craved foods into a balanced meal plan lost more weight during the 12-month weight-loss program and their cravings remained minimal through the subsequent 12 months of maintenance.

Then-graduate student Nouf W. Alfouzan and nutrition professor Manabu T. Nakamura, who published their findings in the journal Physiology and Behavior, said that dieters' food cravings decreased while losing weight and remained minimal as long as they did not regain weight. The participants were part of a larger project conducted with physicians at Carle Clinic in Urbana, Illinois, that aimed to broaden the outreach of an in-person weight-loss program called the Individualized Dietary Improvement Program by converting it to an online format called EMPOWER.

We recruited obese patients ages 18 to 75 who had comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes and could benefit from losing weight. Cravings are a big problem for many people. If they have a lot of cravings, it is very difficult to lose weight. Even when they are able to control their cravings and lose weight, if the cravings come back, they regain the weight."

Manabu T. Nakamura, nutrition professor

Although many dieters reported in prior research that their cravings decreased while losing weight, Nakamura and Alfouzan said it remained unclear whether these changes persisted when they reached their weight-loss goal or quit dieting while trying to maintain their weight. Alfouzan, the first author of the current study, wanted to investigate that along with whether reduced cravings correlated with greater weight loss.

The dietary program used in the study educates dieters about key nutrients, helping them make informed decisions about their food selections until sustainable dietary changes are achieved, Nakamura said. Dieters used a data visualization tool that plots foods' protein, fiber and calories so they can enhance nutrition while minimizing the calories they consume.

During the first year, participants engaged in 22 online nutrition education sessions created by scholars at the university's Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning that included strategies for dealing with cravings.

"If you are eating and snacking randomly, it's very hard to control," Nakamura said. "Some dietary programs exclude certain foods. Our plan used an 'inclusion strategy,' in which people incorporated small portions of craved foods within a well-balanced meal."

Every six months participants completed a questionnaire about their cravings for specific foods. These included high-fat foods such as hot dogs and fried chicken, fast food fats like hamburgers and chips, sweets such as cakes and cookies, and carbohydrates such as biscuits and pancakes.

The researchers also assessed the frequency and intensity of participants' cravings with another survey. Using a scale ranging from 1 (never) to 6 (always), individuals rated themselves on statements such as, "Whenever I have food cravings, I find myself making plans to eat" and "I have no willpower to resist my food cravings." The intensity of each dieter's cravings was calculated by adding their scores for all 15 statements.

Dieters also weighed in daily after getting out of bed and before breakfast using a Wi-Fi scale that transmitted the data to the researchers so they could track the changes.

A total of 30 people began the weight-loss program, and the 24 who remained at the end of the first year had lost an average of 7.9% of their starting weight. Of these, 20 people completed the yearlong maintenance program, but because a few regained some of what they had lost, their average weight loss was 6.7%, the researchers found.

Participants who lost more than 5% by the end of the study experienced consistent reductions in the frequency and intensity of their cravings while those who lost less than that did not. The team also found that individuals' craving for food in general and for specific types of foods such as sweets and carbohydrates diminished during the year of weight loss and stabilized during maintenance.

This finding suggests that individuals' reduced cravings correlated with decreased body fat rather than the negative energy balance of dieting, Nakamura said. "This basically debunks the hungry fat cell theory, a longstanding hypothesis that fat cells become starved for energy and trigger cravings, causing dieters to eat and ultimately regain what they lost. But that is not the case. As long as you stay at a healthy weight, your cravings will remain low."

Of the 24 participants who remained in the study at 12 months, more than half reported they used the inclusion strategy to manage cravings, some people as frequently as one to three times a day, while others used it once a week or more. Those who used the strategy lost significantly more weight compared with other participants and experienced significant reductions in their cravings for sweet and high-fat foods, the researchers found.

Consistency is another key to managing cravings and weight, Nakamura said. "The popular myth is you have to have a very strong will to fend off temptation, but that is not the case. Fluctuations in eating patterns, meal times and amounts trigger cravings, too. You have to be consistent."

Researchers have developed an extremely thin, flexible imager that could be useful for noninvasively acquiring images from inside the body. The new technology could one day enable early and precise disease detection, providing critical insights to guide timely and effective treatment.

As opposed to existing prohibitively large endoscopes made of cameras and optical lenses or bulky fiber optic bundles, our microimager is very compact. Much thinner than a typical eyelash, our device is ideal to reach deep regions of the body without causing significant damage to the tissue."

Maysam Chamanzar, research team leader from Carnegie Mellon University

In the Optica Publishing Group journal Biomedical Optics Express, the researchers showed that the microimager, which is only 7 microns thick - a 10th of an eyelash diameter - and about 10 mm long, can be used in a mouse brain for structural and functional imaging of brain activity. The width of the thin film imager can be customized based on the desired field of view and resolution.

"With further development, the microimager could be implanted for short- or long-term imaging or attached to catheters to image internal body parts like the gastrointestinal tract or inside of blood vessels," said Chamanzar. "It could also be used with surgical tools to provide real-time visual feedback to surgeons to improve the surgical outcome and reduce the chance of adverse effects."

The miniaturized endoscope is based on a flexible photonic platform that uses the biocompatible transparent polymer Parylene to create photonic components such as waveguides. The researchers originally developed Parylene photonics to create miniaturized implantable devices that provide targeted light delivery in tissue.

In the new work, the researchers used the bidirectional capability of Parylene waveguides, which can both deliver and detect light, to create an array of waveguides designed for imaging tissue structure and function. They designed a microimager with waveguides that each have a micromirror at both ends. One or more of the waveguides deliver light to illuminate the tissue while backscattered light is collected by the micromirrors, coupled into other individual waveguides and transmitted to the back end. There, the light is projected onto an image sensor array. With this design, each waveguide effectively relays a pixel of the tissue image.

 "We made the miniaturized endoscope using microscale fabrication techniques similar to those used in microelectronics and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)," said M. Hassan Malekoshoaraie, the doctoral student who designed and demonstrated these endoscopic imagers. "This allows the waveguides and micromirrors to be easily customized for imaging various tissues with the desired resolution."

To demonstrate the miniaturized endoscope, the researchers first showed that it can image fluorescent microspheres embedded within a scattering medium, enabling 3D localization of the microspheres. They then used the microimager to capture a fluorescent image of mouse brain tissue expressing green fluorescent protein. Finally, they demonstrated functional neural imaging from mouse brain tissue that expresses genetically encoded calcium indicators, demonstrating that the microimager can capture neural function.

 "We validated the functional optical images obtained using our endoscopes using by comparing with ground truth electrophysiology recording," said Vishal Jain, a neuroscientist on the research team. "Observing such a strong correspondence between the imaging data and electrophysiology was encouraging."

The researchers say that this work is one step toward their overarching goal of imaging neural tissue in action. "We eventually want to be able to correlate neural activity to the transcriptional profile of specific cell types involved in the population activity," said Chamanzar.

Next, the researchers want to integrate light sources, image sensor arrays and filters into the device's back end to implement a fully integrated standalone microimager for in vivo applications. This could allow the microimager to be surgically implanted in tissue for applications such as imaging remnant cancer cells after tumor removal or monitoring disease progression after treatment.

A new study led by researchers at Tulane University suggests that people with high blood pressure can significantly reduce - and possibly eliminate - their increased risk of premature death by controlling several key health risk factors at once.

The study, published in Precision Clinical Medicine, tracked more than 70,000 people with hypertension and over 224,000 without it, using data from the UK Biobank. Researchers followed participants for nearly 14 years to understand how managing these risk factors affected early mortality - defined as dying before age 80.

The eight health risk factors evaluated in the study include: blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, LDL "bad" cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, smoking status and physical activity. Notably, researchers found that hypertensive patients who had addressed at least four of these risk factors had no greater risk of an early death than those without high blood pressure.

Our study shows that controlling blood pressure is not the only way to treat hypertensive patients, because high blood pressure can affect these other factors. By addressing the individual risk factors, we can help prevent early death for those with hypertension."

Dr. Lu Qi, corresponding author, HCA Regents Distinguished Chair and professor of epidemiology in the Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University

Hypertension, defined as a blood pressure of 130 mmHg or higher, is the leading preventable risk factor for premature death worldwide.

The study found that addressing each additional risk factor was associated with a 13% lower risk of early death, 12% lower risk of early death due to cancer and 21% lower risk of death due to cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of premature death globally.

"Optimal risk control" – having 7 or more of the risk factors addressed – was linked to 40% less risk of early death, 39% less risk of early death due to cancer and 53% less risk of early death due to cardiovascular disease.

"To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the association between controlling joint risk factors and premature mortality in patients with hypertension," Qi said. "Importantly, we found that any hypertension-related excess risk of an early death could be entirely eliminated by addressing these risk factors."

Only 7% of hypertensive participants in the study had seven or more risk factors under control, highlighting a major opportunity for prevention. Researchers say the findings underscore the importance of personalized, multifaceted care - not just prescribing medication for blood pressure, but addressing a broader range of health behaviors and conditions.

When a person remembers their friend telling them a funny story, they associate the sound of that friend talking with the appearance of that friend speaking and laughing. How does the human brain form audiovisual memories like this? In a new JNeurosci paper, Emmanuel Biau, from the University of Liverpool, and colleagues addressed this question by exploring brain activity linked to forming memories that integrate sounds and visual information. 

The researchers elicited memories in study participants by presenting them with movie clips of people speaking. They manipulated when sounds and visual information were presented in the movie clips to explore the impact on brain activity during memory recall. Movie clips with speech sounds and lip movements occurring at the same time were linked to oscillatory activity in two brain regions during viewing of the clips. This oscillatory activity reoccurred when participants remembered the movie clips later. But movie clips with speech sounds lagging behind lip movements reduced oscillatory activity during viewing as well as during memory recall.

Says Biau, "We assume that if auditory and visual speech inputs arrive in the brain at the same time, then their chance of being associated in a memory is much higher because they will fall into the same phase of neural activity, which is not the case for asynchronous stimuli."

According to the authors, their work suggests that the oscillatory activity in these two brain regions may play a crucial role in integrating auditory and visual information during memory recall, though more work is needed to confirm this.

Premature infants are at risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or BPD, a type of lung injury associated with increased mortality. Now a new study published at the ATS 2025 International Conference shows that ciliary dynamics may play a role in the pathophysiology of this disease.

Researchers found that infants with more severe BPD showed signs of ciliary dysfunction that were not present in those with moderate disease. It's the first study to examine the link between BPD and cilia, tiny hairlike structures that help clear the airways of mucus and pathogens.

Ciliary dynamics have never really been studied before in BPD, and we found they can have a significant impact on the pathophysiology."

Daniel A. Yassa, MD, first author, pediatric pulmonologist at UT Health Houston

BPD is a type of chronic lung injury that can occur in premature infants as a result of barotrauma and oxygen injury. Existing therapies focus on protecting the functional tissues of the lungs, airway management, and managing vascular complications. However, the impact of ciliary function and the ability of cilia to clear mucus hasn't been understood.

Cilia work by "beating," or moving in coordinated pulses to propel mucus out of the body. Dysfunctional mucociliary clearance is known to be linked to recurrent infections and progressive lung damage, Dr. Yassa noted.

For the new, retrospective study, researchers used high-speed video microscopy to observe nasal samples from nine infants with BPD, analyzing four recordings for each patient. The team found a distinct reduction in the angle and amplitude of cilia beats in patients with severe BPD, compared to those with more moderate disease.

The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms that influence BPD severity and point to a potential role of mucociliary clearance in the development of the disease, Dr. Yassa said.

"This potentially allows us to have a better understanding of the disease process, which can affect all aspects of clinical care," he said. The findings could potentially point to new therapeutic targets, help classify BPD diagnoses, or lead to other advances in managing BPD.

Next, the researchers hope to continue with follow-up studies.

"Future research with larger cohorts and advanced imaging modalities is warranted to further elucidate the implications of ciliary dynamics and physical properties on clinical outcomes in patients with BPD," he added.

Mauricio Pochettino and the U.S. men's national team must get back to winning ways this summer in the Concacaf Gold Cup, but they'll have to do so without three top talents.

The USMNT released their 60-player preliminary roster on Monday with Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Yunus Musah among those in the fold. Not named were Borussia Dortmund's Gio Reyna, Juventus's Weston McKennie and Tim Weah. The three players were not released by their clubs for international duty given the overlap with FIFA's new Club World Cup and Gold Cup. 

After the demoralizing results against Mexico and Canada in the Concacaf Nations League, Pochettino is down three key players during an important summer.

McKennie and Weah are big losses. Both players should be viewed as starters in midfield and attack respectively, meaning Pochettino will need to call on second-choice options. It's a big opportunity for whoever receives playing time given how close the World Cup is. 

In Reyna's case, despite his lack of recent appearances, he's still viewed by fans as a top talent waiting to be unlocked by Pochettino. Fans have cried out for more creativity, let alone a spark in attacking scenarios. Pulisic has played in the number 10 role under this coach, but he's best deployed out wide where he can threaten defenders and create scoring opportunities. Forcing him to dictate the start of attacks hampers his ability elsewhere. 

Reyna is the solution there, for many, but given his limited playing time under Pochettino and lack thereof during the latter years of the Gregg Berhalter era, missing Gold Cup could cause his stock to fall even further. Reyna's made just 15 appearances this season for Dortmund in the Bundesliga. A groin injury kept him out for most of the early season, but he's made just two appearances in Germany's top flight since Mar. 8 for a combined 20 minutes. 

Perhaps Dortmund will use him during the Club World Cup where he can first and foremost impress his national team coach, but also raise his stock at the club level so he can earn more playing time at Dortmund or elsewhere if they choose to sell him this summer.

The 60-player preliminary roster must be cut down to a final 26-player roster by June 4. Pochettino likely will opt for a wealth of experience given the aforementioned absences, but he needs to also start cultivating talent from Major League Soccer like Charlotte FC's Patrick Agyemang, Vancouver Whitecaps' Brian White and Sebastian Berhalter.

Players that show out during Gold Cup should likely get opportunities to further impress during the September friendlies against Japan and South Korea.

La Liga

Real Madrid are planning for midfielder Jude Bellingham to have surgery on a persistent shoulder problem after the 2025 Club World Cup.

Specialists consulted by The Athletic indicated Bellingham will likely be sidelined for around 12 weeks while he recovers from the operation and is expected to miss the start of the 2025-26 La Liga season.

Bellingham, 21, dislocated his left shoulder against Rayo Vallecano in November 2023. The England international completed the match against Rayo but subsequently missed the next four games for club and country. He has frequently worn shoulder protection ever since.

The Athletic reported in October that Madrid sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, had indicated their understanding was that Bellingham would require surgery at some point to ensure the shoulder fully heals properly, and to avoid a high risk of further dislocations.

The busy football calendar has not yet provided Bellingham with an opportunity to undergo surgery, given the time off to recover it will demand.

It is planned he will undergo surgery at the same clinic used by Ferland Mendy, Antonio Rudiger and Eder Militao for their respective quadriceps, meniscus and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) operations this season.

It is unclear whether Bellingham had suffered previous shoulder problems before the dislocation against Rayo during his debut season in Spain, but Madrid staff sources said in 2023 they were aware of shoulder problems during his spell at Borussia Dortmund between 2020 and 2023. Photos show him wearing shoulder support on two occasions when playing for the German club.

Bellingham has made 51 appearances in all competitions for Madrid this season, providing 14 goals and 14 assists.

The inaugural Club World Cup runs from June 15 to July 13. Madrid will play Al Hilal, Pachuca and Red Bull Salzburg in Group H.

GOAL breaks down where PSV's four Americans stand after the trophy parade

With six games remaining, PSV were nine points back of Ajax in the Eredivisie. They'd led the Dutch top flight at one point by as much as nine points, but following Ricardo Pepi's injury in the winter, their form fell off a cliff. Heading into the final few matches of the season, a second consecutive title felt like an impossibility.

Yet, there they were on Monday, parading the league title around Eindhoven. It was a comeback or a collapse for the ages, depending on who you ask, and at the center of it all, all season long, were the club's four American stars.

Malik Tillman was spotted enjoying the celebrations, and he more than earned the right to do so. The U.S. men's national team midfielder was one of the Eredivisie's best all season long, calling into question just how long he'll actually be playing in the Dutch league.

Pepi's his injury didn't prevent him from soaking in a second title in as many seasons - well deserved considering he scored 11 league goals in 18 appearances. Same for Sergino Dest, who returned for the home stretch to help PSV's comeback for the title. And then there's Richy Ledezma, who deputized so admirably for Dest during his recovery that he, too, became a vital piece of the PSV puzzle.

Aside from Pepi, who continues to recover from his injury, the other three could be with the USMNT this summer. All four, meanwhile, are commanding discussions about their future. The 2024-25 season was more of the same for PSV: more success, more goals, and more winning. Heading into the 2025-26 season, though, it'll be interesting to see where the club's four Americans will be when it all gets going.

...

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — The U.S. men's national team failed its first competitive test of the Mauricio Pochettino era in rather embarrassing fashion, losing to Panama 1-0 in a CONCACAF Nations League semifinal here at a half-empty SoFi Stadium.

The Americans played timidly, unimaginatively and laboriously for 90 scoreless minutes. They were booed off the field at halftime. They looked uninspired, even with a home-soil World Cup on the horizon. They seemed destined for extra time against a team they were heavily favored to beat — and one that, based solely on talent, they should have beaten.

But they couldn't. And then, in the 94th minute, the seemingly unthinkable happened.

Cecilio Waterman beat U.S. goalkeeper Matt Turner.

Panama prevailed, and jumped for joy at midfield as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and the rest of the USMNT's golden generation trudged out of sight, into Sunday's third-place match. Panama will face Mexico, which beat Canada 2-0 in Thursday's late game, in the final on Sunday.

They played just as they had toward the tail end of the Gregg Berhalter era. Berhalter was fired following the Copa América, largely because the U.S. lost to Panama 2-1 after playing most of a group-stage match with 10 men.

Pochettino replaced Berhalter last fall. His mandate was to revive a plateauing program. His early results were largely positive.

But in his first true elimination game, with 11 men, the U.S. suffered a familiar fate.

And in a sense, they regressed. The Americans had won all three prior editions of the Nations League. Under Berhalter, in semifinals and finals, they'd beaten Mexico three times, and Canada, Jamaica and Honduras once apiece.

But Panama posed different problems. Under head coach Thomas Christiansen, Los Canaleros are now 4-1 against the U.S. in competitive games. They frustrated the USMNT yet again on Thursday, and earned a famous result.

And they gave Pochettino, and players, and fans a lot to chew on at the start of this last full calendar year before a landmark World Cup.

"The way we approached the game and started the game wasn't in the right way," Pochettino said.

"We played too slow," he added. "We didn't show aggression with the ball" — nor without it. "The first half was really painful to see," Pochettino said.

They played with none of “the grit, the desire, the nastiness” that McKennie said Pochettino has been trying to instill, and as a result, they have relinquished their grip on regional supremacy; they flunked one of only two competitions that they'll have between now and June 2026; and they got this critical phase of World Cup preparations off to a downright dreadful start.

The future of Portugal's national team is under the spotlight as whispers of a high-profile reunion grow louder. Jose Mourinho, one of soccer's most iconic managers, is once again linked with his homeland — and with a possible reunion with Cristiano Ronaldo ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. While Portuguese officials have remained silent on any imminent changes, Mourinho's recent five-word response to swirling rumors has only added fuel to the fire.

According to multiple reports from Turkish media, the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) is eyeing Jose Mourinho as a potential successor to Roberto Martínez, whose contract runs until July 31, 2026. The move, if completed, would represent Mourinho's first venture into international management.

Per HT Spor journalist Ahmet Selim Kul, Mourinho has already reached a preliminary agreement to take over the national side following the conclusion of the UEFA Nations League finals this June. The 62-year-old tactician is currently under contract with Fenerbahce, but his first season in Turkey has been underwhelming, marked by elimination in both the Europa League and Turkish Cup, and falling short in the Super Lig title race, which was sealed by rivals Galatasaray.

Despite the setbacks, he remains a towering figure in Portuguese soccer, and his appointment would bring him back into contact with Cristiano Ronaldo, whom he famously managed at Real Madrid between 2010 and 2013. Their relationship during that period was complex but fruitful: Ronaldo scored 168 goals in 164 appearances under Mourinho, a staggering record of efficiency and brilliance.

While speculation intensified across Turkish and Portuguese outlets, Mourinho finally addressed the rumors during a post-match press conference following Fenerbahce's 2-1 win over Eyupspor. With all eyes on him, the experienced boss delivered a calm but defiant denial.

“Yes, I can deny that I had any meeting with the Portuguese Soccer Federation. I am a loyal person,” he told reporters. “The only time I had direct contact with a club, I informed Fenerbahce. It wasn't now, it was in January.”

That moment — Mourinho's five-word phrase, “I am a loyal person” — quickly grabbed headlines. It poured cold water on reports of active talks, but many saw the denial as strategic rather than conclusive. Insiders suggest Mourinho is weighing his options, especially as the FPF is reportedly unwilling to pay the Yellow Canaries' release clause, complicating any immediate move.

The Portuguese boss is reportedly open to a mutual termination of his contract to facilitate the switch, should discussions become formalized after the Nations League.

HOUSTON (May 20, 2025) - U.S. Soccer announced today that Houston Dash defender Avery Patterson will join the U.S. Women's National Team for a pair of friendlies against China PR and Jamaica during the upcoming FIFA window. Patterson will depart for camp this weekend following Houston's match against Bay FC at Shell Energy Stadium.

The first friendly is scheduled for 4:30 p.m. CT on Saturday, May 31 against China at Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minn. Fans can follow the match live on both digital and legacy platforms (TBS, HBO Max, Universo & Peacock in Spanish and on the radio on Westwood One Sports). The USWNT will face Jamaica at 7 p.m. CT on Tuesday, June 3 at Energizer Park in St Louis, Mo. Fans can follow that match live on TNT, HBO Max in English or Universo and Peacock in Spanish. The match will also air on the radio on Westwood One Sports.

Patterson earned her first cap and first start for the U.S. Women's National Team during their most resent set of friendlies. She made her senior team debut on April 5 against Brazil after she entered the match late in the second half. The 22-year-old made her first start with the USWNT in the following match. Patterson has been part of the U.S Youth National Team program at the U-14, U-20 and U-23 level, and was also named to the Futures Camp in Florida earlier this year.

Patterson scored her first goal of the season earlier this month against Racing Louisville on May 2. The defender made an instant impact during her rookie season and was named the Newcomer of the Year. The University of North Carolina alum signed a contract extension through the 2027 regular season on Dec. 5, 2024.

Houston close a two-match homestand on Saturday, May 24 as they host Bay FC for Kids Nights at 4 p.m. CT. Following the FIFA international window, the team will travel to Florda to face Orlando Pride FC on Saturday, June 7. The club will return to Shell Energy Stadium to celebrate their annual Pride Night on Friday, June 13 as they host San Diego Wave FC at 7 p.m. CT. Tickets for that match are available on SeatGeek.

A city report says that the cost of some services the province said it would pay for out of its $97-million contribution are “substantially higher” than budgeted, which may leave Toronto on the hook for more money.

A city report says that the cost of some services the province said it would pay for out of its $97-million contribution are “substantially higher” than budgeted, which may leave Toronto on the hook for more money.

Toronto expects it will cost $380 million to stage six games for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Toronto may be forced to take on a greater share of hosting costs for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, as the city and Premier Doug Ford's government remain at odds over the province's contribution with just over a year before the tournament is set to kick off.  

The city expects it will cost $380 million to stage six games for the global soccer tournament. Queen's Park agreed in late 2023 to provide up to $97 million of that, while the federal government has pledged about $104 million, and the city is responsible for about $179 million.

According to a new report from city staff, the overall budget for the tournament hasn't increased. But while Queen's Park had previously said its contribution would include the value of provincial services required for the tournament — such as increased policing, transportation and health care — the report states that Ontario's estimated value of those services are “substantially higher than budgeted, and in some cases completely unbudgeted.” 

According to the document, which will be debated at council this week, there are more than $39 million in costs for provincial services still under negotiation between the two governments, which would come out of the province's $97-million share, “increasing the city's funding gap.”

They include $15 million for the ministry of health, $14 million for the Ontario Provincial Police, $7 million for the Ministry of Transportation, $2 million for the ministry of sport, and $25,000 for the ministry of intergovernmental affairs to facilitate events for dignitaries.  

The report from executive director of Toronto's World Cup secretariat Sharon Bollenbach says that the city will continue negotiations with the province “to reduce uncertainties around scope and lowering ministry service costs.”

The city hopes to “maintain as much of the $97 million contribution in cash (as possible) to offset Toronto's hosting responsibilities” while keeping the tournament within the approved budget, according to the report. 

The city was already facing a $18-million shortfall in its hosting budget, according to a separate report released this month. It planned to make up that gap through a combination of private donations, merchandise sales, hospitality packages and other measures. 

The 2026 World Cup is being co-hosted by 16 cities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The tournament is scheduled to kickoff June 11, 2026 in Mexico City, with Toronto's BMO Field staging the Canadian national team's opening game on June 12. 

The federal government announced $104 million for Toronto's costs last May, while the provincial government told the city in Dec. 2023 it had “conditionally committed” up to $97 million. 

In a letter to city manager Paul Johnson, Deputy Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport Sarah Harrison said Queen's Park's contribution would be “exclusively limited” to investments that would deliver public infrastructure and community benefits that would outlast the games. 

That would include “provincial priorities such as community infrastructure projects with long-term public benefit, sport legacy and tourism support impacts.” 

It would exclude any costs where the “primary beneficiary” would be a nonpublic entity, such as a private or for-profit company.

GOAL US writers discuss the strengths, weaknesses of Pochettino's preliminary squad ahead of 2025 Gold Cup

Welcome to redemption time for the USMNT. Mauricio Pochettino's side endured a miserable Nations League finals slate in march, leading to the inevitable widespread panic ahead of the Gold Cup. the Argentine manager this week released his preliminary 60 man squad for the tournament, which kicks off next month.

There are very few surprises here. Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Folarin Balogun and Tyler Adams are all in the mix. Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Gio Reyna are all absent due to Club World Cup duties. Ricardo Pepi still needs time to recover from a knee injury, and won't be risked.

Otherwise, it's a full strength side - at least, in the original pool. Pochettino is expected to name a 26-player squad this week ahead of pre-tournament friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland.

That said, there is room for debate. The preliminary list includes seven (!!) goalkeepers, way too many attacking midfielders, and a whole load of defenders that all will believe they have a shot to make the squad at a position of relative weakness.

Who will make it, who shouldn't, and what does this vast preliminary list tell us about the direction of the USMNT? GOAL US writers debate all that in the latest edition of... The Rondo.

The American billionaire was speaking at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday and Chelsea, as expected, was a hot topic of conversation, particularly with the club's Champions League fate being decided this week.

Chelsea have qualification in their hands and will head to Nottingham Forest this Sunday in their final match of the 2024-25 Premier League season. It is the first of two huge games as Enzo Maresca's side also travel to Wroclaw, Poland next week for the Conference League final.

It's been a strong end to the season for Chelsea after a dip mid-season and should they come out unscathed, it will mark a 'very good' first season for Maresca.

"I think we had a good season that can become very good," said Maresca in his pre-Conference League press conference.

Boehly and Clearlake Capital, another one of the Chelsea co-owners, have given the backing of Maresca and will be hoping the 45-year-old can get the Blues over the line, which will give them a significant boost this summer - both in terms of their financial position and ability to convince their top transfer targets to join the club.

During his conference on Tuesday, Boehly was quizzed on a range of topics, including the Club World Cup and the return of Andrey Santos, to the club's stadium plans and transfer expectations this summer.

Here's what the Chelsea co-owner said on Tuesday at the Qatar Economic Forum with Bloomberg.

"A combination of both. It's like in anything I own. The good news is the bad news. If people didn't care then it would stink. It's a testament to how much the sport matters."

"If you look at the Premier League right now, there is so much excitement in it, especially with what's going on at the last weekend. There's seven teams that could be making Champions League. The winner of Tottenham and Man United will go to the Champions League. We'll have nine teams in European competition out of the Premier League alone, which to me is a testament to the quality of the product. To be part of that is a privilege."

"I think the level of competition is ferocious. The margins of error are so small. I don't think I fully appreciated that the margin of error is so small. I think the sport's gotten more and more competitive in the Premier League and that makes winning all that much sweeter. I really didn't know how much I'd love a goal, a goal feels so good. Giving up a goal is the worst. There's nothing like a goal."

"I think Chairman is a pretty good one! I can't play! Maybe I'll go as striker, see how the fans think about that!"

"We have a good partnership. Like every partnership, you have times that you have to work through and times that are better. We hit the ground running in such an intense timeline that it was a complex moment. We're through it and we're excited about what the future holds.

"We think we have one of the best young teams. We were early on doing seven, eight, nine year contracts because we really wanted to make sure that we could keep the team together for a long time. In order to have a really good team you need stability within the team, environment. The only way that comes is through time. We set it up to be able to benefit from that."

"We don't have any clauses like that in any of our contracts."

"We're going to the Club World Cup, so we are laser focused on the Club World Cup. We have some players that are joining us that weren't on the team - Andrey Santos, we're really excited about him and what he can add to the squad."

"We've done most of our investing. We're not looking at it as a spend, we look at it as an investment. We're trying to build the best portfolio of players that can perform at the highest level for the longest periods of time.

"We know what we need to do. We know the places that we need to invest. That's going to be our focus."

"Long term we just have to figure it out. We recognise a club like Chelsea needs a 65,000 person stadium. We also recognise that that's going to be important to be able to compete long term. We'll figure that out."

The new-look FIFA Club World Cup is coming this June and July with every game available to watch live on Foxtel and Kayo Sports.

Thirty-two teams from across six confederations will descend on the United States with the likes of English Premier League heavyweights Manchester City as well as Spanish giants Real Madrid to vie for the title of best club team in the world.

The revamped tournament replicates the format of previous FIFA World Cups with eight groups of four battling it out with the two highest places team in each group advancing to the Round of 16, and it being sudden death through from then on with quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final following suit.

Unfortunately for Australian football fans, no A-League sides managed to nab one of the Asian Football Confederation places, but Auckland City from New Zealand's national league will represent Oceania.

And best of all, all 63 games will be shown live across Kayo and Foxtel.

Here is our guide to how the FIFA Club World Cup will work.



HOW TO WATCH

From the opening game between Lionel Messi's Inter Miami and Egyptian outfit Al Ahly at Hard Rock Stadium, the home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins, on Sunday June 15 AEST to the final at New York's MetLife Stadium on Monday July 14 AEST, you can catch all the action from the FIFA Club World Cup live on Foxtel and Kayo Sports.

A dedicated 24/7 channel will be available on Kayo Sports along with highlights packages, minis from every match and supplementary programming with all the colour and background stories from the tournament.



WHO ARE THE TEAMS INVOLVED?

Asian Football Confederation - Al Ain (UAE), Al Hilal (Saudi Arabia), Ulsan HD (South Korea), Urawa Red Diamonds (Japan).

Confederation of African Football - Al Ahly (Egypt), Esperance de Tunis (Tunisia), Mamelodi Sundowns (South Africa), Wydad AC (Morocco).

Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football - Inter Miami (United States), Monterrey (Mexico), Pachuca (Mexico), Seattle Sounders (United States), TBD (Winner of LAFC v Club America).

South American Football Confederation - Boca Juniors (Argentina), Botafogo (Brazil), Flamengo (Brazil), Fluminense (Brazil), Palmeiras (Brazil), River Plate (Argentina).

Oceania Football Confederation - Auckland City (New Zealand). 

Union of European Football Associations - Atletico Madrid (Spain), Bayern Munich (Germany), Benfica (Portugal), Borussia Dortmund (Germany), Chelsea (England), Inter Milan (Italy), Juventus (Italy), Manchester City (England), PSG (France), Porto (Portugal), Real Madrid (Spain), Red Bull Salzberg (Austria).

WHY IS THERE NO A-LEAGUE TEAM INVOLVED?

Qualification for the FIFA Club World Cup was dependent on either winning a continental title in one of the four most-recent seasons or by having a high ranking of performance in the top-level continental tournament over the four-year period.

No A-League side has won the Asian Champions League (now called AFC Champions League Elite) since Western Sydney Wanderers in 2014, in fact they are the only Australian team to do so, and no A-League teams have performed consistently strongly in Asia in the last four years either.

Therefore, the four spots went to 2023-24 champions Al Ain, 2022 champions Urawa Red Diamonds, 2021 winners Al-Hilal and 2020 victors Ulsan HD.

WHY ARE LIVERPOOL NOT INVOLVED?

It appears odd that the Premier League champions will not be a part of the FIFA Club World Cup, but like in Asia, England's spots are dependent on Champions League success.

Given Manchester City (2023) and Chelsea (2021) have won the European title in the last four years, the two spot England were awarded were given to them rather than Liverpool.

HOW DID OTHER TEAMS QUALIFY?

Some teams who did not win their respective federation's continental title in the past four years were awarded places for their average performance over the four-year cycle.

There was also a spot reserved for the host country, which was given to David Beckham-owned, Lionel Messi-featuring Major League Soccer side Inter Miami.

Fiorentina are expected to part company with striker Lucas Beltran this summer, amid reports he could return to River Plate for the 2025 Club World Cup.

The Viola look set to miss out on European qualification after losing the Conference League semi-final to Real Betis and sliding down the Serie A standings.

This will mean a revamp of the squad and one of the first to go could be Beltran, who fell down the pecking order following the arrival of Albert Gudmundsson from Genoa.

Beltran is a versatile figure, able to play as a centre-forward, a support striker, or a trequartista, which makes his work ethic more valuable than the finishing.

According to Tuttomercatoweb and FirenzeViola, the 24-year-old is being offered a return to his origins in Argentina with River Plate.

He was sold to Fiorentina in 2023 for €12.6m plus bonuses, which reportedly reached a grand total of €18m, considerably lower than the potential high figure of €24m.

Now River Plate coach Marcelo Gallardo wants to relaunch him at his former club in time to participate in the Club World Cup.

It could even be sped up by making this a loan move with option to buy.

The Latest | May 20, 2025

KANSAS CITY (May 20, 2025) — Kansas City Current forward Michelle Cooper along with midfielders Claire Hutton and Lo'eau LaBonta have been called up by the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) for a training camp and a pair of friendlies against China PR and Jamaica during the upcoming FIFA international window. U.S. Soccer announced its 24-player roster on Tuesday as it begins preparation for Concacaf World Cup qualifying in Fall 2026.

After featuring in the USWNT Futures Camp earlier this year, Cooper and Hutton both got their first senior national team call-up in February for the 2025 SheBelieves Cup presented by Visa. This is the first time in her career LaBonta has been called up by the USWNT.

The Stars and Stripes will play China PR on Saturday, May 31, at Allianz Field in Saint Paul, Minn., with kickoff at 4:30 p.m. CT on TBS, Max and Universo. The USWNT returns to action on Tuesday, June 3, to face Jamaica in St. Louis, Mo., at Energizer Park at 7 p.m. CT on TNT, Max and Universo. Both matches will also broadcast in Spanish on Peacock.

Cooper made her USWNT debut during the SheBelieves Cup, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2-0 victory over Colombia on Feb. 20. In the team's next match against Australia, she scored her first international goal in the 68th minute which stood as the game-winner in a 2-1 win. Cooper also had a decorated youth national team career, highlighted by winning the Golden Boot and Golden Ball at the 2022 Concacaf U-20 Championship as well as captaining her team at the 2022 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

Like Cooper, Hutton's first USWNT appearance was in the 2025 SheBelieves Cup when she started against Australia and logged 70 minutes. She joined the starting lineup again – and played every minute – in an April friendly against Brazil. Hutton's international debut was with the U-17 U.S. Youth National Team at the 2022 Concacaf Championship where she scored six goals. She was also tabbed captain of the U-19 squad at the 2023 PanAm Games and played at the 2024 FIFA U-20 World Cup, earning bronze in both events.

Receiving her first USWNT nod is LaBonta, the Kansas City Current captain who has played every minute of the 2025 National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) season thus far and has recorded three goals and an assist. LaBonta, who joined the professional ranks in 2015, solidified herself among the league's all-time greats from the penalty spot on April 19 when she moved up to No. 3 in NWSL history for most regular season penalties scored with 12. She has played in 166 regular season matches as one of 41 players in league history to reach the 150-marker. Additionally, LaBonta has 10 NWSL Best XI honors – tied for third all-time – and has earned the recognition in back-to-back months this year.

The Kansas City Current are back on the road to take on Chicago Stars FC on Saturday, May 24, at SeatGeek Stadium in Bridgeview, Ill. Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. CT. The match will be broadcast on ION with JP Dellacamera and Jill Loyden on the call as well as on World Feed with Matt Pedersen and McCall Zerboni calling the match. The action will also simulcast locally on KMCI, 38 the Spot and Jillian Carroll Letrinko and Dave Borchardt will have the action on 90.9 The Bridge. Fans can also tune in to hear the match in English, Spanish or Portuguese on the KC Current App.

ORLANDO, Fla. (May 20, 2025) — Orlando Pride (5-3-1, 16 points) defender Kerry Abello has earned her first call up to the senior U.S. Women's National Team, it was announced today. Abello will represent the USWNT in the 24-player training camp as they get set to play against China PR on Saturday, May 31, and against Jamaica on Tuesday, June 3.

Since joining the Pride in 2022, Abello has been a staple in the Pride's starting lineup, having most recently become the first player in Pride history to appear in 50 consecutive matches. In 2025, Abello has played in every match so far this year and has played the second most minutes (773) and completes the third most passes on the squad (420).

Last year, the natural left-footer started 25 of a possible 26 games in 2024 and was a key player in helping the Pride secure the double by winning the NWSL Shield and NWSL Championship. Abello was the only Pride field player to play in every match of the 2024 regular season and playoffs and finished the regular season with one goal and two assists.

The 25-year-old has extensive experience with the USA's Youth National Teams. She earned her first call-up at the U-14 level in 2013 and also earned call-ups to the Under-15s (2014), Under-17s (2015), Under-18s (in 2016 and 2017) and Under-19s (in 2017). She also attended a U.S. U-23 WNT camp during her rookie season in 2022, facing India and Sweden. She scored in the 3-0 win over Sweden. Abello has 10 combined U.S. Youth National Team caps, one for the U-17s, four for the U-18s, three for the U-19s and two for the U-23s.

McKeown and USWNT will take on China PR and Jamaica in two friendly matches

Washington, D.C. (05/20/2025) – Washington Spirit defender Tara McKeown has been called up to the U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) for the side's May/June friendlies, U.S. Soccer announced today. The U.S. will take on China PR and Jamaica in two friendly matches beginning later this month. 

McKeown earns her fourth consecutive call-up to the U.S. senior team in just her third season at center back. Making her first appearance and start for the USWNT against Colombia in this year's SheBelieves Cup, McKeown also tallied her first international assist when she connected with Ally Sentnor for a second half goal. 

USWNT's May/June 2025 Friendly Schedule: 

McKeown moved from forward to defender after the 2022 season and has been a stalwart for the Spirit, having played over 3,000 consecutive regular season minutes for the team. An NWSL Defender of the Year finalist in 2024, the standout completed her first career Iron Woman season last year and tallied the late equalizer in the Spirit's NWSL quarterfinal match against Bay FC to force extra time and eventually send the Spirit to the semifinal round. 

The Spirit will take the pitch at Audi Field next on Sunday, June 8 when the side takes on the North Carolina Courage in the club's annual Juneteenth match. Single match tickets are available here. Fans can secure their spot to see the Spirit in all the team's matches at home by becoming 2025 Season Ticket Members here.

ATLANTA (May 20, 2025) – U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes has named the 24-player training camp roster for the upcoming matches against China PR at Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minn., on Saturday, May 31 (4:30 p.m. CT / 5:30 p.m. ET on TBS, HBO Max, Universo & Peacock in Spanish and on the radio on Westwood One Sports) and against Jamaica at Energizer Park in St. Louis on Tuesday, June 3 (7 p.m. CT / 8 p.m. ET on TNT, HBO Max, Universo & Peacock in Spanish and on the radio on Westwood One Sports). Hayes will name 23 players to suit up for each of the two matches.

The June 3 match will feature a special pre-game retirement celebration for St. Louis native and USWNT legend Becky Sauerbrunn with the first 2,000 fans through the gates receiving a Becky Sauerbrunn bobblehead.

GOALKEEPERS (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 0) Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 3), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United, ENG; 1)

DEFENDERS (8): Kerry Abello (Orlando Pride; 0/0), Crystal Dunn (Paris Saint-Germain, FRA; 159/25), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC, ENG; 66/1), Naomi Girma (Chelsea FC, ENG; 44/2), Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit; 5/0), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash; 2/0), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride; 3/0), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC; 107/2)

MIDFIELDERS (6): Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC; 33/1), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 165/37), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current; 2/0), Lo'eau LaBonta (Kansas City Current; 0/0), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 5/2), Lily Yohannes (Ajax, NED; 6/1)

FORWARDS (7): Lynn Biyendolo (Seattle Reign FC; 78/22), Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current; 4/1), Catarina Macario (Chelsea FC, ENG; 23/10), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville; 4/1), Ally Sentnor (Utah Royals; 7/2), Alyssa Thompson (Angel City FC; 17/1), Gisele Thompson (Angel City FC; 3/0)

“Everyone always earns their call-ups but there are some much-deserved call-ups in this camp for players who have shown consistency in league play,” said Hayes. “We have two different types of opponents ahead of us, so we'll have to be creative in breaking down those teams in different ways. Now that everyone has settled into a rhythm with their clubs, or is coming right off their European seasons, our players are at a good level. As has been one of our focuses this year, this camp and the following camp are going to be two amazing opportunities to develop squad depth.”

The roster features seven different players from the USWNT roster that faced Brazil in two matches in early April, headlined by the return of defender Naomi Girma, who has not featured for the USA in 2025 due to injuries but is back to fitness after helping Chelsea FC win the Women's Super League title and FA Cup in England.

Forward Lynn Biyendolo brings her 78 caps and 22 goals back to the roster after missing the April games. Nineteen-year-old Portland Thorns FC midfielder Olivia Moultrie, who has not played for the USA since last October against Iceland, also makes a return. She also played for the USA in early March of 2024 at the Concacaf W Gold Cup, a tournament in which she scored her first two WNT goals.

In addition, Hayes continues to give chances to uncapped players, awarding first-ever senior WNT call-ups to Orlando Pride defender Kerry Abello and Kansas City Current veteran midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta. Abello is a natural left-footer who started 25 games in 2024 and was a key player on the Pride's 2024 NWSL title team. If LaBonta, 32, the Current captain and midfield anchor, plays in St. Paul or St. Louis, she will become the oldest player to debut for the USWNT program in its 40-year history. The third uncapped player on the roster is Seattle Reign goalkeeper Claudia Dickey.

Abello and LaBonta, who has three goals this season for the first place Current, are the 22nd and 23rd first-time call-ups under Hayes. Four additional players earned first-time call-ups under former interim head coach Twila Kilgore after Hayes was hired in November of 2023.

Four of the seven forwards on the roster are 22 years old or younger, and two – Ally Sentnor and Michelle Cooper – scored their first USWNT goals during the SheBelieves Cup earlier this year. Sentnor, the 2024 U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year, scored twice in that tournament – against Colombia and Japan – and Cooper tallied against Australia on a goal set up by Sentnor. Alyssa Thompson has four goals and two assists so far for Angel City while her younger sister Gisele, whose previous call-ups have been at outside back, will get a run as a winger during this camp. Racing Louisville forward Emma Sears also has four goals this season.

The roster includes 17 players from the NWSL and seven who are currently playing their professional club soccer in Europe: two in France, four in England and one, Lily Yohannes, in the Netherlands. The Kansas City Current has three players on the roster while the Utah Royals, Seattle Reign FC, Angel City FC, Portland Thorns FC and the Orlando Pride all have two. Chelsea FC also has two.

Naomi Girma was called up to the women's national soccer team Tuesday for the first time this year, joining 23 others for friendlies with China and Jamaica.

Girma, who was named to FIFA's global Best XI last year, has been sidelined with calf injuries but recently returned to fitness, going 90 minutes in two of Chelsea's last three games in the Women's Super League. Her last appearance for the U.S. came in the gold medal final of the Paris Olympics in August.

Sisters Alyssa and Gisele Thompson, who started their second senior national team match together last month, were also called up but this time with Gisele, a defender, making the roster as a winger. Alyssa has four goals and two assists this season for Angel City, for whom her sister also plays.

Marco Reus scores in the 87th minute as the Galaxy rally to a 2-2 draw with LAFC that ends their five-match losing streak but keeps them winless on the season.

“Everyone always earns their call-ups but there are some much-deserved call-ups in this camp for players who have shown consistency in league play,” USWNT coach Emma Hayes said in a statement. “We have two different types of opponents ahead of us so we'll have to be creative in breaking down those teams in different ways.”

In addition to Girma, seven other players from the Olympic championship team were called up. But Hayes also summoned three uncapped players in Orlando Pride defender Kerry Abello, Kansas City Current midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta and Seattle Reign goalkeeper Claudia Dickey. Canyon Country teenager Olivia Moultrie, who hasn't played for the U.S. since Hayes took over last May, is also on the roster.

“This camp and the following camp are going to be two amazing opportunities to develop squad depth,” Hayes said.

Still missing from the team are forwards Sophia Wilson (née Smith), Trinity Rodman and Mallory Swanson. Smith and Swanson are on maternity leave while Rodman is injured. The trio combined for 10 of the 12 U.S. goals in last summer's Olympics.

The U.S. will play China at Allianz Field in St. Paul, Minn., on May 31 and Jamaica on June 3 at Energizer Park in St. Louis. Here's the roster:

Goalkeepers: Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United).

Defenders: Kerry Abello (Orlando Pride), Crystal Dunn (Paris Saint-Germain), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC), Naomi Girma (Chelsea FC), Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC).

Midfielders: Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current), Lo'eau LaBonta (Kansas City Current), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC), Lily Yohannes (Ajax).

Forwards: Lynn Biyendolo (Seattle Reign FC), Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current), Catarina Macario (Chelsea FC), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville), Ally Sentnor (Utah Royals), Alyssa Thompson (Angel City FC), Gisele Thompson (Angel City FC).

Pellegrino Matarazzo sits, relaxed and comfortable. An easy smile he flashes often punctures his calm, solution-oriented answers in our 45-minute chat.

Matarazzo jokes that part of his brain comes from his math background (he graduated from Columbia University with a degree in applied mathematics). It's one of many facets that makes the 47-year-old New Jersey native who he is.

Another way to see Matarazzo is as the trailblazing American men's soccer coach that he is. 

He left the states after college to play professionally in Europe, settled in Germany and never left. Matarazzo got his first big break as manager of Stuttgart, who he led to the Bundesliga. He took over at Hoffenheim during the 2022-23 season, saved the club from relegation then qualified for the Europa League in his first (and only) full season at the club.

His reputation has grown to the point that Matarazzo interviewed with the U.S. national team for the vacant men's head coach job last summer.

“I'm not going to deny it: There were good talks (with U.S. Soccer) that took place,” Matarazzo told GIVEMESPORT. “At that time (last summer), it was not meant to be.”

A few months later, in February, Matarazzo was let go by Hoffenheim amid a period of chaos and internal strife at the club. 

“Many times, extraordinary circumstances are the chance for a tremendous learning experience,” Matarazzo said.

He has spent the last seven months enjoying his time. Taking a bit of a reset from the daily grind of soccer, and traveling, but Matarazzo is ready to get back in the game.

The successful coach opened up about his experience of breaking barriers as an American manager in Europe, his time and dismissal at Hoffenheim, talks with the USMNT and much more in a wide-ranging conversation with GIVEMESPORT. His answers have been lightly edited for brevity.

GMS: People in football – coaches in particular – have the competitive nature, wanting to control everything, locked into the daily grind. So, what has the last 6-7 months of your life been like? How do you spend your time, how do you feel?

Pellegrino Matarazzo: Well, I'm very conscious of time.

Enjoying every moment, it's really a great opportunity to pause and reflect on things. Spend time with family and friends and grow personally. I've been travelling quite a bit, to the United States and Italy to visit family, but also places that interest me. My latest trip was to Japan for two weeks with my wife and my son. A fascinating country. On one side you have spiritually and tradition, then you have the modern spirit. The contrast is truly impressive. When you travel, when you're open to expanding your horizons, it'll happen.

Of course I've been using my time on a professional level. Watching football always interests me, even though the first two months I had my TV off to create distance.

I like watching selected games. Teams, coaches, matchups that I value tactically. 

Also I use the time to follow up on certain leagues where maybe there's the possibility of future employment. I think that's normal. It's important to understand the subtle differences from the Bundeslliga, to say, Serie A or the Premier League. Different cultures, training methods, style of play.

You say your TV was off for two months. Was that deliberate, in that “I know this is good for me to step back”, or was that like “I just need the time to get away?”

PM: Both. 

It was deliberate where I had to catch myself to not turn on games when I wanted to. Sometimes when you put distance, you rest a bit then your soccer gene kicks in. That's why I said “selected”. I really started with selected games of coaches that interested me. From zero soccer, to selected matches to possible future employment. 

You left Hoffenheim in November. With some space now to decompress, how would you sum up your time at the club?

PM: To be honest, I look at the positive side. I'll always be grateful for my experience in Hoffenheim, I was able to work with some great people. Despite a very turbulent environment at the club, we were relatively successful. 

Many times, extraordinary circumstances are the chance for a tremendous learning experience. I know I grew as a coach and a leader. When I joined the club in February 2023, there was this ongoing internal power struggle happening and they were in a 9-match winless run. 

We managed to build a focused, strong, cohesive unit and save the team from relegation. The following season, we qualified for European competition.

One game that sums up my time there was our 4-2 win against Bayern Munich in the final game of the season last year, securing a spot in the Europa League. It was a special moment that showed our true character. We went down 2-0 in the first six minutes. We remained composed, showed resilience, determination and belief and ended up scoring four goals to win against Bayern Munich. 

That showed who we were and football doesn't get much better than that. What happened in the summer— well, I guess we can get into that if you have questions.

Please, go on.

PM: Hoffenheim is a club that stands for developing talent and playing attacking football. We scored 66 goals in 2023/24. Maxi Beier, Tom Bischof are just two obvious examples of developed talent. We integrated several other players from the youth academy to the first team. In these areas we were doing very good work.

What happens? (Director of football) Alex Rosen is dismissed in the middle of preseason. The middle of training camp. In the middle of training! With no prior notice! 

Alex was vital to our success, it was a joy working with him. We had a routine every morning where we'd drink matcha tea and discuss the day, allowing us to align with our thoughts.

His dismissal threw the entire club to a very unusual state. What many people don't realize, other senior leaders left the club as well and the result was a big vacuum in club leadership. It was an extraordinary circumstance. My main objective was to keep the players and staff calm, focused on football. It was intense. 

There were a lot of late transfers being made. There's always an advantage when a squad is assembled early, especially when you're in European competition, otherwise you don't have preparation time to integrate game philosophy or establish leadership in the squad. 

Not only did Hoffenheim make many late transfers, they were often positions and profiles where the coaching staff were looking for something else. 

It was a challenging time. It required a lot of mental flexibility on my part. Knowing when to fight hard, but knowing when to let things go. I learned a lot in this phase.

Do you feel betrayed in any way in being let go by Hoffenheim after all you did to save from relegation and then qualify for Europe? 

PM: I mean, who betrayed me? Who was the club? There was a change in leadership. I don't know who I should feel betrayed by, Alex Rosen signed me, he was no longer there. 

I don't feel betrayal, I feel the feeling of unfinished work. There was a lot more to be achieved at the club. I know we were on the right path.

Changing gears— You are among the trailblazers for American coaches in top European soccer. Is that an active thought that ever dawned on you or is it just, like, “I'm doing my thing”?

PM: I'm just doing my thing. I'm just in my tunnel, doing the best I can and getting as far as I can go.

What were the difficulties – if any – you experienced as an American manager breaking through in Germany? Or because you played there and had been there for so long, were you viewed as an honorary German?

PM: I have been here for 25 years and I've broken many barriers along the way. In the beginning, people knew I was Italian-American, they had doubts.

It was a motivation for me to be better. To be better in every way possible I could be. I remember applying for my pro coaching license, the extra difficulties for me to get in. Maybe that's what helped me get to where I am now, the need for excellence. I was fluent in German relatively early. That was an advantage in the German football culture, you need to be able to speak the language.

I definitely had my obstacles to overcome and I think I did an alright job.

I think so too, so much so that you were connected with the U.S. men's national team job. Was that real, did you interview for that? And is that something that would interest you in your career?

PM: I'm not going to deny it: There were good talks (with U.S. Soccer) that took place. At that time (last summer), it was not meant to be.

As a coach, the chance to lead a national team – especially your own – is something special. It was an honor to be associated with a role like that. Of course I would be open to it in the future if the project fits and the timing is right.

You mentioned earlier that you were watching specific leagues that could be where your next job is. Is there anything you're able to say on which leagues those are?

PM: I definitely have a clear vision and ambitious goals for what my career should look like as a head coach, but I also understand the path is not always linear. 

Every coach has the ambition to lead a top team in a top league in Europe, to compete in Champions League. I'm certainly now exception, especially since I've gained experience in the Bundesliga and Europa League. Of course I can imagine continuing in the Bundesliga, I love the football culture here. Working in the Premier League is a goal for a lot of coaches who want to work at the highest level. That's a dream.

Serie A is also appealing to me because of a very emotional component to it, with my family roots coming from Italy. I used to watch the Serie A on a very small TV in my father's room growing up.

To be honest, I'm open to many things. I don't rule out anything. In general, it's about taking the next step to help me grow. 

Lastly, to anyone reading, I want to let you give this in your own words– How do you see the game? What is your preferred style?

PM: When I watch games, I see spaces, I see numbers, I see rhythms. 

I consider myself very adaptable to the existing conditions of a club and I form my squads around their strengths in order to win, to create identity. I consider myself a flexible coach, and with my math background, very solution-oriented. It's important in modern football to be very adaptable. The football I played at Stuttgart was very different than the football I played at Hoffenheim, but we reached our goals at both clubs.

That being said, I have an attacking and forward-driven nature. I want to be in control. I like to dominate the center of the pitch, in and out of possession, and a strong focus on change of pace. I don't just mean moments of transition, that's obvious, but all crucial moments. It's important to protect yourself in moments of vulnerability and it's important to hurt your opponent when they're exposed.

That's a little of what I'm about.

Florian Wirtz is arguably the most sought-after talent in the world right now and Liverpool have taken steps to signing him

The 21-year-old defender would be ‘open and happy' to join Liverpool this summer.

Big praise from the World Cup-winning German. 

Pep Guardiola doesn't believe he should be in the conversation of the greatest manager ever while he's not retired, and offered his trio of GOATs.

Eric Cantona dismissed the idea that Pele is the greatest player in football history - instead offering his own pick for that crown.

The defender was seen watching the away end in full swing and fans have their thoughts on what his feelings were.

Herc Gomez discusses the USMNT's striker options ahead of the upcoming Concacaf Gold Cup (1:33)

When it comes to the U.S. men's national team, manager Mauricio Pochettino isn't exactly working with a blank canvas. The core of the team that reached the knockout stages of the 2022 World Cup remains in place.

But with the 2026 World Cup, which is being co-hosted by Canada, Mexico and the U.S., little more than a year away, the Argentine can be forgiven for feeling an urge to erase some parts of the picture while filling in a few additions of his own. That's what last March's woeful showing at the Concacaf Nations League, in which the U.S. fell to Panama in the semifinals and Canada in the third-place game, can do to the thought process of a manager. With that display fresh in mind, there might be a growing sense of urgency to look at other options.

Now, Pochettino did engage in a degree of experimentation during the CNL. Real Salt Lake midfielder Diego Luna emerged as a player on the rise, a wild card who can give the U.S. manager more options in attack. Ditto for Charlotte FC forward Patrick Agyemang, with the Vancouver Whitecaps' Brian White also getting some looks.

Circumstances, even beyond results, might open the door a bit wider for some additional new blood.

The Concacaf Gold Cup starts next month, and the likes of Timothy Weah and Weston McKennie won't be available due to Juventus' Club World Cup commitments. The same could be true for Giovanni Reyna if he hasn't yet extracted himself from his Borussia Dortmund purgatory. There are also a pair of friendlies in early June against Turkey and Switzerland to allow Pochettino the chance to bring in some new players.

With that in mind, here are a few potential candidates who have yet to get a look under Pochettino, but have made their case for a call-up and made U.S. Soccer's 60-man preliminary roster.

Aaronson has filled a variety of roles in Utrecht's midfield this season, sometimes more withdrawn, and at times more advanced, but usually tilted to the left side of midfield. Regardless, Aaronson's eight goals and four assists this season have not only helped Utrecht secure a fourth-place finish (good enough to make the qualifying rounds for the UEFA Europa League) but he was recently nominated for the Johan Cruyff Young Talent of the Year award as the Dutch league's top young player. He'll head back to Frankfurt next season with a better shot of remaining with the first team.

As for the USMNT, Aaronson's versatility should stand him in good stead with Pochettino, and McKennie's presumed absence could create an opening for some playing time. Like everyone on this list, he has made the 60-man provisional roster for the Gold Cup.

Blackmon is something of a late bloomer. He's a product of the U.S. college system, having played at the University of the Pacific, and started his professional career as a right back with LAFC. He was called up to the USMNT for a January camp in 2021, but an injury prevented him from getting on the field.

Blackmon gradually made his way as a center back with Vancouver and has enjoyed a stellar start to the season, playing a massive role in the Caps' Concacaf Champions Cup triumph over Inter Miami CF. Blackmon's passing out of the back has been a particular strength, ranking in the 99th percentile in MLS among defenders in terms of progressive passes completed, according to ESPN Research.

Blackmon's rise could come at the perfect time as well in terms of the USMNT, as the center-back play for the U.S. at the CNL was inconsistent. But the USMNT isn't the only team that is taking notice of Blackmon's performances this season. Sources told ESPN that Canada has been inquiring about Blackmon possibly playing for the CanMNT.

In 2021, Berhalter seemed on his way out of MLS after an indifferent season with Austin FC, but a move to Vancouver gave him new life. And no player has benefited more from Concacaf Champions Cup performances than Berhalter, whose two goals and two assists in the semifinal round against Miami were instrumental in dispatching the Herons. The competition has also served to illustrate Berhalter's box-to-box running and uncanny ability to arrive into the box at the right time to finish off attacking moves.

Like Aaronson, Berhalter faces a crowded midfield for spots, especially with the likes of Johnny Cardoso returning after missing out on the CNL. But the Vancouver midfielder's ability on set pieces -- long a sore spot for the U.S. -- should also stand him in good stead.

In the Sullivan household, Cavan has received most of the attention of late, given his scheduled move to Manchester City. But older brother Quinn has quietly put together an impressive first three months of the season in Philadelphia. He has assisted on seven goals, tied for second in MLS, and delivered 30 key passes, the eighth-highest total in the league. All of this has helped lead the Union into second place in the Eastern Conference.

Sullivan's usual spot on the left wing is typically occupied by one Christian Pulisic, but there's nothing wrong with having increasing depth, especially given Sullivan's ability off the dribble, as well as his creativity. He has shown an ability to pop up in other areas of the field as well.

The only question now: Will Pochettino give him a chance?

Outwardly, there was some upheaval attached to Wiley's season. He was initially loaned to Ligue 1 side Strasbourg but a pair of injuries (knee tendinitis and a separated shoulder) limited him to only six league appearances and the loan was cut short. Wiley fared much better during a subsequent loan to Watford in the English Championship, so much so that there is talk he'll return to the Hornets on another temporary deal next season.

As for the U.S., the absence of both Antonee Robinson and Sergiño Dest during the CNL showed there still isn't much depth at the fullback positions. This is especially true in terms of players with ability to get forward, a strength of Wiley's. At present, there is an opportunity there for him to make his mark.

Reports in Italy claim that Inter's latest offer of €23m is close to meeting Olympique de Marseille's demands for Luis Henrique, and that the Nerazzurri are confident that he will be part of the squad for the FIFA Club World Cup, which starts in mid-June. 

Inter have been on the tail of the Brazilian winger for several months, and are close to striking a deal with Marseille, who have recently confirmed that the player will be leaving at the end of the 2024-25 season. 

“We aim to sell Luis Henrique before June 30 for financial reasons and out of respect for our ownership. The Club World Cup radically changed contracts,” Marseille President recently disclosed. 

He also added that: “Discussions are ongoing with other clubs, not just [Inter].”

According to reports from La Gazzetta dello Sport, Inter are close to sealing an agreement with Marseille after their latest offer of €23m. Marseille have reportedly been pushing for a price tag in the region of €25m. 

The Pink Paper adds that there is now ‘very little left' before a formal agreement is struck between the Nerazzurri and Marseille. 

Reports in April claim that there is already a verbal agreement in place over a five-year contract in San Siro, which will run until the summer of 2030.

Hello! Today we're writing about one of football's richest clubs. Who you've probably never heard of. From a space-age city which hasn't been built.

On the way:

💰 Saudi's $1.5tn NEOM project

🗣️ Delap holds Man Utd talks

🥹 Tearful Martinez moving on?

👀 Salah's collector's item

Searching for The Line on a map of the world is a fool's errand, because the city doesn't exist. It's a concept in the mind of Saudi Arabia's royal family, part of a futuristic project known as NEOM which in theory will hold a population of nine million.

A staggering sum of money, $1.5tn (£1.1tn), has been set aside to turn the vision into a reality. The Saudis envisage The Line — an ambitious, or ostentatious, trail of infrastructure spanning 170km  — being front and centre when the country hosts the FIFA World Cup in 2034. To that end, they want a stadium and a football club to match the largesse.

This is where NEOM SC come in, a shrouded enigma which James Montague has done as well as anybody in unravelling. This determined piece of digging, published in The Athletic and comprising a chapter from a book written by James, epitomises football's transfer of power to new frontiers, and the Middle East most of all.

NEOM are owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the deep-pocketed Saudi entity which runs Newcastle United. Before PIF picked NEOM up, they were known as Al Suqoor, a team with crowds barely worth registering. But Tabuk, the city in northern Saudi where Al Suqoor played, was near the land allocated for The Line — so PIF selected them for a rebrand and a capital injection.

PIF controls the entire NEOM scheme and the extravagance of its intentions can't be overstated. The Line (for which construction has started) is supposed to have no currency or roads. Robots will act as servants and cars will fly. A state-of-the-art stadium is being designed to sit half a kilometre off the ground. It sounds like a Marvel movie.

In the future, PIF sees a day when NEOM SC move to The Line and become one of the world's biggest teams. They could already be classed as the world's richest. But from a standing start, how is such a steep jump in status remotely feasible?

Saudi investment in football invariably brings with it allegations that the Gulf state is engaged in ‘sportswashing': using the game to enhance its global image and divert attention from concerns about issues like its human rights record.

It is, however, very close to FIFA and the governing body's president, Gianni Infantino. Saudi Arabia was nominated to host the 2034 World Cup unopposed, 12 years on from the tournament being held in Qatar. For better or worse, it's at the heart of football's political evolution and its wealth is helping to make its voice heard.

As for NEOM, they were promoted to the Pro League for the first time last month. Attendances are up to 10,000. One strand of PIF's strategy is to ensure they qualify for the 2029 Club World Cup, which tells a story about how FIFA's new hobby horse is attracting the attention it craves.

James was able to get inside NEOM SC and speak to key stakeholders there, an achievement in itself since the NEOM building site is secretive, inaccessible and virtually unphotographed. NEOM's chairman, Meshari al Motairi, had never been interviewed before James pinned him down. He described sport as an “accelerator for many things” — isn't it just? — and was in no doubt that NEOM were headed for the big time.

This will go one of two ways. Either the club rise like a rocket, or they go down as another episode of the Emperor's New Clothes. But however things turn out, NEOM aren't the story here. They're a mere pawn in football's Game of Thrones, where the sands are shifting rapidly.

There's a definite trend of Europe's big clubs getting their ducks in a row on the transfer front early. Real Madrid have done Dean Huijsen. Liverpool should push Jeremie Frimpong over the line shortly. And now, Manchester United are making inroads with Liam Delap and Matheus Cunha.

Cunha to Old Trafford from Wolverhampton Wanderers has been in the offing for a while, helped by a £62.5m ($83.5m) release clause. That deal is advancing. But while Ipswich Town striker Delap has a release clause too (lower, at £30m), he's hugely in demand. Laurie Whitwell's report of face-to-face talks between the 22-year-old and United officials can only be a positive sign for Ruben Amorim.

How much the club's intentions rest on Champions League qualification through the Europa League final remains to be seen but either way, Amorim is crying out for new toys. He's got David Beckham in his corner, telling The Athletic that Amorim is “a very good manager”. Beckham might have bigger things to worry about at Inter Miami but when he speaks, people listen. A little nudge at the hierarchy won't hurt.

🎙️ Our podcast team have been trying to decide: will winning the Europa League final fix United? I'm not convinced it's as simple as that, and neither are they. Listen on Apple and Spotify.

Whether Emiliano Martinez is the world's best goalkeeper is a matter of debate. This season hasn't been his finest. But for two years running, he's been voted as such: the winner of the Yashin Trophy in 2023 and 2024.

On Friday, however, Martinez was in floods of tears after Villa's final home game of 2024-25, the universal sign of a player about to check out. As Jacob Tanswell and Gregg Evans explain, the 32-year-old's situation is up in the air. No decision has been taken on his future and no transfer has been finalised. But it's easy enough to read the room.

Villa have been dealing with intense PSR pressures, and Martinez would command a tidy fee. He's a showman, a World Cup winner, a penalty expert and a wind-up merchant, and he's an easy keeper to love if he happens to be yours. Nothing better demonstrates that than Villa's fans launching a donation page aimed at raising $7m to retain him.

What next for Martinez, then? And how would Villa manage the end of his era, or the gaping hole he leaves behind? Because the Argentine packing up is a potential parting we didn't see coming.



(Selected games, times ET/UK)

Premier League: Crystal Palace vs Wolverhampton Wanderers, 3pm/8pm — Peacock Premium (U.S. only); Manchester City vs Bournemouth, 3pm/8pm — USA Network, Fubo/Sky Sports.

Last night's fixture at the Amex was a formality for Liverpool. As our own Adam Hurrey — aka Football Cliches — would have it, the Premier League champions are spiritually on the beach.

Just as well for Mohamed Salah, who strayed a thousand leagues out of character by sticking a sitter wide, above, with Liverpool 2-1 up against Brighton (they went on to lose 3-2). Yesterday we asked if Le Havre's Abdoulaye Toure was human. It turns out that Salah is. Which is nice to know.

The 33-year-old will leave City after a decade at the club having lifted six Premier League titles, as well as winning the Champions League and Club World Cup in 2023.

The Belgian is under contract until June 30, which covers three Club World Cup matches in the United States, but De Bruyne said he would have to look out for his own interests.

"I think in a way I have to take care of myself because if I get injured in the Club World Cup, what am I going to do? Nobody's going to take care of me at that point," he said after the FA Cup final in quotes carried by The Athletic.

"So there's a big chance probably that I won't play it, but I don't know. I'm just a player. I don't make the rules, I can't do anything about it. 

"So in the end, like I said, I'll probably have to take care of myself."

The 32-team tournament runs from June 14 to July 13.

Real Madrid has agreed to make its second pre-Club World Cup signing according to Spanish radio station COPE, which cited anonymous sources.

Los Blancos have already reacted to a trophyless season, in terms of primary domestic and European silverware, plus newfound dominance from bitter rival FC Barcelona, by agreeing for head coach Carlo Ancelotti to leave at the end of the season.

He is likely to be replaced by club legend Xabi Alonso, and though there has been no official announcement from Madrid on the matter yet, the former midfielder has already revealed he will step down from his head coach role at Bayer Leverkusen, who he helped clinched its first Bundesliga title in 2023/2024.

As we often see when things don't go right for the Bernabeu giants, President Florentino Perez has been getting his cheque book out to try and level up with Barca next term.

Before what is expected to be a busy summer in the transfer market, Madrid has already completed the signing of Bournemouth and Spain central defender Dean Huijsen, who was released from his Premier League contract after the payment of a $67 million (£50 million) release clause at the weekend.

According to COPE, Madrid has reached another agreement with a young star because it will re-sign Nico Paz from Como prior to June 30.

If the deal is completed before said date, Madrid can recapture its ex-Argentina international for just $6.7 million (€6 million) after selling him last summer. But if it waits until July 1 onwards, that amount will then rise to $10.1 million (€9 million).

The plan is to have Paz successfully complete the ‘Carvajal Route' - which entails leaving Madrid and then returning to form part of the first team as the right back of the same name did from Leverkusen more than a decade ago - prior to the lucrative Club World Cup.

It now remains to be seen if the deal gets over the line, but it shouldn't be too complicated to complete with the tournament kicking off in over three weeks' time.

Earlier this season, Ancelotti revealed that Madrid had been keeping tabs on Paz in Italy.

“He's one of us, we're following him, he's doing very well, I have no doubts. At the end of the season we'll decide what to do. If I have to give advice to a youngster... I think patience is a great quality,” said the Italian.

At Real Madrid, the 20-year-old is expected to battle for minutes with the likes of Fede Valverde, Jude Bellingham, Brahim Diaz, and Arda Guler.

With LA playing host to FIFA World Cup matches in 2026, the city's bars are bound to be packed. The city's soccer bars are rooted in the city's history as a sports capital and entertainment powerhouse. 

The city's earliest bars, like Big Dean's Oceanfront Café in Santa Monica, opened in 1902, welcomed beachgoers and sports fans long before flat screens and craft beer defined the modern scene. But the true blueprint for the American sports bar opened in Long Beach in 1979, when former LA Rams lineman Dennis Harrah opened Legends. The vision was to create a communal space filled with memorabilia where fans could watch games on giant screens and celebrate LA's teams together. Legends quickly became a hub not just for sports fans, but also for business deals and local 90s power brokers, reflecting LA's unique blend of commerce and celebrity. 

Today, LA's sports bars cater to every fans of every team and sport, from the Lakers to the Clippers, Dodgers, Rams, Kings, Sparks, and LAFC games, as well as UFC, March Madness, and international soccer. Bar menus reflect the city's international feel, with everything from English breakfasts as European bars to Mexican taquerias and African specialities. And naturally, the best LA sports bars have plenty of craft beers on tap. 

Whether you're a local or a visitor, these are the best LA soccer bars for watching the 2026 FIFA World Cup matches, no matter where in the city you're based.

The Fox and Hounds in Studio City is the official home of Arsenal Los Angeles, but its reach extends to nearly every Premier League supporter group in the Valley. The bar opens as early as wildly early at 4:30 AM for major matches, complete with an English breakfast menu and a lineup of British ales. Scarves and signed jerseys cover the walls, and the clientele is a mix of British expats and local die-hards who treat the bar as a second home. On North London Derby days (days when north London rival teams Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur match up), the crowd often spills onto the patio. The Fox and Hounds describes itself as “a proper British pub,” so you can count on being able to watch nearly every game at this LA soccer bar when the World Cup matches get underway in 2026.

Joxer Daly's in Culver City is a longstanding headquarters for Liverpool and Arsenal supporters, with both clubs' official LA supporters' groups calling it home. Te soccer focus at Joxer's is evident as soon as you walk in, with banners, scarves, and match schedules plastered to the walls, and staff who are well-versed in the nuances of being an English soccer bar. Like The Fox and Hounds, this LA soccer bar also opens quite early for matches in Europe (an eight-hour time difference), and the Irish breakfasts are available just as early. Joxer Daly's also shows MLS and international games, and its location in Culver City makes it a convenient stop for fans from Venice, Santa Monica, and beyond. The bar regularly hosts themed events for finals and derbies, often with giveaways and club-specific drink specials, so it's extremely likely it'll have quite the party going on when the World Cup begins in 2026. 

Joxer Daly's: 11168 Washington Blvd, Culver City, CA 90232







A post shared by Tom's Watch Bar – Las Vegas (@toms_lasvegas)


It's pretty easy to tell from the name alone that Tom's Watch Bar is one of the most well-known sports bars in LA. It sits directly across from the Crypto.com Arena (formerly the Staples Center) and serves as the official LA Galaxy watch party venue. It's not joking around when it comes to watching matches, with more than 150 screens arranged in a 360-degree screen setup so every seat has a clear view. LA Galaxy hosts frequent events at Tom's, including player appearances, supporter rallies, and giveaways. Tom's carries the full “MLS Season Pass,” making it one of the few bars in LA to reliably show every MLS match, not just the Galaxy. The menu is group-friendly, with shareable plates and a rotating list of beers. On match days, the crowd is a mix of die-hard Galaxy supporters and neutral fans drawn in by the electric atmosphere and central location, so it's a good place to watch 2026 World Cup games no matter who you're rooting for.

Tom's Watch Bar: 1011 S Figueroa St b101, Los Angeles, CA 90015

Springbok Bar & Grill in Van Nuys is LA's only South African-owned soccer bar and an official bar partner of the LA Galaxy. Naturally, it shows every Galaxy match, as well as major international tournaments like the Africa Cup of Nations and the World Cup. The menu is also more exciting that your average sports bar, with South African specialties like boerewors rolls, peri-peri chicken, and biltong, alongside American bar classics. Regulars at Springbok include both local MLS fans and expats following the South African Premier Division; it also shows rugby and cricket when soccer isn't on the screen. The large outdoor patio is a draw for big match days, and the bar frequently collaborates with supporters' groups for themed events and charity fundraisers. Plus there's karaoke on Thursday and Sunday nights.

Springbok Bar & Grill: 16153 Victory Blvd, Van Nuys, CA 91406 







A post shared by Ye Olde King's Head (@yeoldekingshead)


Ye Olde King's Head in Santa Monica is a second home for British expats and Premier League fans in LA's western stretches. The bar opens early for Premier League matches, filled by supporters' groups for Tottenham, Chelsea, and Manchester United. That means the bar is generally filled with regulars, making it one of the best LA soccer bars to swing by when you're planning on cheering for England — or at least a team a key Premier League player is on. The pub's collection of memorabilia like signed shirts, historic photos, and club banners has been collected over time, reflecting its long history as a soccer destination in LA. There's even an on-site British that sells imported snacks and FC merch, plus afternoon tea service 'til 4 PM. 

Ye Olde Kings Head: 116 Santa Monica Blvd, Santa Monica, CA 90401 







A post shared by The Greyhound Bar & Grill (@thegreyhoundbarandgrill)


The Greyhound Bar & Grill in Highland Park is the official home of the Los Angeles Spurs, the supporters' club in LA for London's Tottenham Hotspur FC. The bar opens early for every Spurs match, with fans regularly filling the bar and spacious outdoor patio, even on early mornings. The Greyhound kitchen serves up full English breakfasts on match days, and the supporters' group makes sure big matches are celebrated. On match days, expect coordinated chants, halftime raffles, and special events for major fixtures — which means you shouldn't come in cheering for whomever the Spurs are up against. Like most LA soccer bars, the Greyhound also screens other Premier League and European matches, but Tottenham Hotspur matches will always take priority, with a crowd that knowns every song and stat. Fortunately, the Spurs will likely have several players fielding World Cup teams, so the bar will probably be lively throughout the 2026 matchups.

La Chuperia in Lincoln Heights is the go-to place for fans of Liga MX and the Mexican national team. It's a popular gathering spot for supporters of El Tri (the Mexican national football team, nicknamed “La Tricolor,” or “La Tri,”) with every match shown on multiple screens, usually with commentary in Spanish. La Chuperia's walls are adorned with soccer memorabilia, and the energy is always high during Liga MX and El Tri matches, with fans chanting, debating lineups, and celebrating like they're in the stands at Estadio Azteca. The bar's signature micheladas, rimmed with Tajín, are a must-order for, who will likely be packing this LA soccer bar above all others when Mexico is playing.

TOPICS:

The U.S. Men's National Soccer Team released its preliminary 60-man Gold Cup roster this past week which will eventually be chopped down to the final 26-man group by no later than June 4th.  Despite being unable to make the Olympic squad 1 year ago at this time (a squad comprised almost exclusively of players under the age of 23), no one is surprised to see Diego Luna's name included on the list with many believing he has a strong chance of making the final 26-man team as well.

Luna's rapid rise under new USMNT Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino accelerated during the team's January camp when the 21-year-old suffered a broken nose against Costa Rica but refused to leave the game, registering an assist on their opening goal almost immediately after.



“Coach is looking at me like ‘are you ready to come off?'” Luna recounted on the most recent episode of Unfiltered Soccer with Landon Donovan and Tim Howard.  “And I'm like, ‘no, there's no way, there's no way.  There's no way I'm coming off in the fifteenth minute, because of this thing, you know? I can still run, I can still see, you know, you're not stopping me right now.'”

Luna's skill has always been apparent but that determination is what has begun to take him to the next level and never was this more on display than that January night in Orlando.

“In those moments, you think in your head, this is an opportunity where you can take the easy way and, you know, hop off and, you broke your nose, what a story, blah, blah, blah. Or, you're gonna grab your chance and go for it.  So, I think for me it was just saying there's no way I'm coming out of this game.”

After not being named to the 2024 Paris Olympic squad, Luna is more aware than most of just how precious these opportunities are.  And now, he has a coach on the national team level that is not only providing him with the opportunity to prove himself but one that he has been able to connect with as well.

“The biggest thing about [Pochettino] is that he made me feel comfortable off the field as a human, which allowed us to be able to feel free and no pressure when you're on the field. And I think that was the biggest thing for me. He knows how to connect with the players one-on-one.”

While Pochettino may have been the one to present Luna with his chance, you can't say the Real Salt Lake midfielder hasn't forced the issue with his play on the field.  After scoring 13 goals in his first 67 appearances with RSL, Luna has already scored 7 times in 13 starts this season.  And while he remains steadfast on the task at hand in MLS, it is also not lost on him of what's looming in the summer of 2026.

“That's the big goal, right?” Said Luna.  “Every game with RSL, every opportunity I get with the national team, it's grind time. You got one big goal in a year and every little thing you do is now setting you up to either make [the World Cup team] or to not.”

When Sara Errani played her first professional tournament in April 2002, 47 of the competitors in this year's Roland Garros qualifying draw had yet to be born.

Nonetheless, at the age of 38, two days removed from lifting the Internazionali BNL d'Italia doubles trophy alongside Jasmine Paolini and 13 years removed from her appearance in the Roland Garros final, the Italian proved that she's still got it. Errani came back from the brink to defeat Jule Niemeier 0-6, 7-6(4), 6-2, having trailed 5-2 in the second set.

The match was a microcosm of her career. Seemingly down and out, overpowered by a stronger and taller opponent, Errani used her heart, brains and sheer grit to turn an apparent lost cause into a glorious victory -- as she's done so often over the past two decades. In the second-set tiebreak, Niemeier hammered overhead after overhead at Errani, but it was the veteran who won that point with a clean winner. Next up, she'll face Niemeier's German compatriot, Anna-Lena Friedsam, who held off a late comeback attempt by 16-year-old wild card Ksenia Efremova 6-1, 7-5.

Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko has had a sensational season so far -- five ITF trophies, a final at the Parma WTA 125 and eye-catching performances in Miami and Rome, where she stretched Paula Badosa and Coco Gauff to three sets. The 18-year-old, at a career high of No. 122 and playing the first Grand Slam qualifying event of her career, kept her momentum going with a 6-4, 6-2 defeat of Sinja Kraus. Next up is Liechtenstein's Kathinka Von Deichmann, who routed No. 7 seed Rebecca Marino 6-1, 6-0.

Novak Djokovic has confirmed that Dusan Vemic will work with him heading into this month's French Open following his split from Andy Murray. The two all-time greats ended their four-month partnership, with the Serb having struggled for form since reaching the semi-finals of the Australian Open.

Vemic, 48, is a former professional player who himself played in the French Open. He's previously been part of Djokovic's coaching staff and will work alongside Boris Bosnjakovic, his assistant coach and analyst. Djokovic made the announcement during his press conference at the Geneva Open, ahead of his opening match with Marton Fucsovics tomorrow.

However, he also stressed that compatriot Vemic will not serve as his full-time trainer, and insisted he would not be rushed into any decision. He said: "At the moment, I'm not in need of a coach.

"I don't need to rush in any context. I feel comfortable with the people around me....in the next few tournaments, and we'll see what happens."



There were high hopes for Djokovic's working alongside Murray but the Serb's form dipped later into their exciting partnership. And he addressed their split during his press conference.

He added "We felt like we couldn't get more out of that partnership on the court, and that's all there is to it. My respect towards Andy remains the same, even more actually, I got to know him as a person.

"I think he has a brilliant tennis IQ, he has a very rare mind of a champion that obviously has achieved what he has achieved, and he sees the game incredibly well."

Djokovic will be desperate to kick on in Geneva this week as he goes in search of his 100th ATP title after withdrawing from the Italian Open. He hasn't won a single clay-court match so far this season and is looking to rediscover his form ahead of the French Open starting on Sunday.

My respect towards Murray remains the same - Djokovic

Novak Djokovic says he "couldn't get more" out of his partnership with Andy Murray but is in no rush to find a new coach.

The Serb, who turns 38 on Thursday, parted company with former rival Murray earlier in May after six months working together.

Djokovic has taken a wildcard into the Geneva Open - one of the final tournaments before the French Open - as he looks to find more rhythm on the court.

The French Open starts on Sunday, with Djokovic seeking a standalone record 25th Grand Slam title.

On his time working with Murray, Djokovic said: "We felt like we couldn't get more out of that partnership on the court, and that's all there is to it.

"My respect towards Andy remains the same, even more actually, I got to know him as a person.

"I think he has a brilliant tennis IQ, he has a very rare mind of a champion that obviously has achieved what he has achieved, and he sees the game incredibly well."

Djokovic has yet to win a match on clay this year, having suffered early exits in Monte Carlo and Madrid before skipping the Italian Open.

Lifting the title in Geneva would make Djokovic just the third man in the Open era to win 100 ATP singles titles - as well as be a welcome boost before Roland Garros.

Djokovic is joined in Geneva by Dusan Vemic, who was previously part of his team, and assistant coach and analyst Boris Bosnjakovic.

"At the moment, I'm not in need of a coach," Djokovic said.

"I don't need to rush in any context. I feel comfortable with the people around me.

"In the next few tournaments, we'll see what happens."

Djokovic reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open in his first tournament working with Britain's former world number one Murray, before he was forced to retire through injury.

He has had a difficult start to the 2025 season, losing his first match in four of his past five tournaments and being beaten in the Miami Open final by Czech 19-year-old Jakub Mensik.

Djokovic will face 134th-ranked Hungarian Marton Fucsovics on Wednesday.

Before his campaign in Geneva, Djokovic has not won on clay this season after losing his opening matches in Monte Carlo and Madrid.

Among his 24 major titles - which leaves him tied with Margaret Court for the all-time record - the French Open is his least successful, with three triumphs.

"It's a different chapter of my life that I'm trying to navigate myself through," Djokovic said.

"I'm not particularly used to having this kind of circumstances where I would lose a consecutive match, tournaments, first rounds and so forth. I don't think it ever happened for me in the last 20 years. But I knew that eventually that moment will come.

"I'm trying to do well, I'm trying to win more trophies, I'm trying to build my form for Roland Garros, and perform at the desired, necessary level in order to go far in the tournament and challenge the best players in the world.

"So yes, the motivation is still there."

Tennis is a ‘fun hobby' for the player looking to add to grand slams won in SW19 and at the Australian Open

It's slightly unusual to hear Henry Patten – along with Harri Heliövaara, the reigning men's doubles champion at Wimbledon and the Australian Open – call tennis a “fun hobby”. But then you spend time in his company and realise he is slightly unusual.

Patten, 29, was not supposed to be a professional, never mind a grand slam winner. Though he played county level as a child, he enjoyed various sports as a teenager before a tennis scholarship to Culford School in Suffolk – “I don't know how we weaselled that!” – inspired him to attend college in North Carolina, where he read economics.

“We'd have two hours' training in the afternoon, a foreign concept to me,” he says. “That was where I learned how to be a professional without really understanding what was happening, because I was having a good time.”

Patten, a late developer missed at every level, evidences a flawed system. Though he acknowledges that “it's pretty tough to see a hundred 12-year-olds and say which'll be a champion”, even when he excelled in the US no one paid attention. “I came home and the first professional event, someone from the LTA came up and said: ‘Who are you?' I didn't know how to take that.”

So he agreed to join Ernst & Young as a technology risk consultant, but was saved by the pandemic, doing well enough in bubble events for his family to insist he pursued tennis seriously. “Thank goodness they talked me around otherwise I wouldn't be sitting here. A friend works at EY and he's absolutely miserable, whereas any time I'm upset or struggling, I can play tennis. It completely engrosses you and takes your mind off whatever else is going on.”

Patten's calm sense of perspective is striking, but a debut grand slam final is of a palpably different order – especially for an unseeded, unknown Briton in SW19. “The first time we played Wimbledon I was trying to act like I wasn't nervous at all, and we lost very quickly, so now I let the nerves be there,” he says. “But this time I couldn't stop smiling, it's the coolest thing ever. Walking down the corridor, past the trophies and underneath the Kipling quote, it feels like the absolute pinnacle of anything.”

Emerging to a crowd, though, is different – “You want that moment to last for ever, don't really want to start playing tennis” – and as the contest intensified into an unfathomable epic, the atmosphere became equally feverish. “The whole way we were clinging on desperately,” Patten tells me, “so I didn't feel much pressure until the last point, and Harri hit a great first serve – I didn't even touch the ball.”

After which, mayhem. “What was amazing was I had everyone in my box,” Patten says, “and they all had the same face on that I had on … the craziest, best feeling ever, a home crowd going completely ballistic, everyone's just nuts. To create those emotions in people, it's an absolute honour.”

In Melbourne, six months later, it was Patten tasked with settling another classic: “I felt a lot more pressure thinking blindly, ‘Serve it out, just serve it out.' I went completely blank so Harri came and said, ‘Your serve is great, serve here; I'm going to go here,' which usually the server would dictate. I served an ace and said, ‘OK, now tell me how to serve on this one.”

Before teaming up with Finland's Heliövaara, Patten partnered fellow Briton Julian Cash, eventually realising that he had to be ruthless to progress. “One of those difficult conversations you just have to have, and we had it. What's unusual is we're still friends and we've got seven Brits in the doubles top 50, which is unbelievable – it's a golden age.”

Doubles, though, suffers from a chronic lack of funding, coverage and care, despite proof – exemplified by Patten's experiences – that people love it. “It's a team sport, so you've got different tactics,” he explains when asked to pitch it. “You see a lot more variation in the shots – singles is mainly baseline rallies, but doubles has net play with quick hands, it's absolute carnage.

“Singles, you have a pretty strong idea of who's going to win, whereas doubles, everything's out of the window … I know friends of years who split up and hate each other. Fundamentally, you're dealing with extremely competitive 30-year-old men who travel the world together – it's a recipe for disaster!”

Patten also has a vision for change, citing padel as an example. “There's always a good energy. Most sports, the spectacle is great but it's really about being with friends and having a nice time, so you could turn doubles into something different, with music and free crowd movement. Doubles has a great chance of becoming this unique, fun event … if the authorities let it.”

The United States Tennis Association (USTA) has announced an $800 million investment, unveiling plans to reimagine Arthur Ashe Stadium and construct a cutting-edge Player Performance Center to elevate the US Open's global stature and athlete experience in Flushing.

The investment, which represents the largest single investment in US Open history, will elevate fan, player and partner experience at the annual tournament at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, USTA officials said at a launch event at the Times Center at 242 W 41st St. in Manhattan on Monday evening.

Officials said the project will be funded entirely from the USTA's coffers and is scheduled to completed by the 2027 US Open, with work to take place across multiple phases.
USTA CEO Lew Sherr said spectators may not immediately notice a difference inside Arthur Ashe when the work is complete but said that is part of the idea. However, the work will also include noticeable upgrades to the stadium's concourses and suite levels, Sherr said.

The project will expand the number of courtside seats in the stadium from 3,000 to 5,000 by moving the venue's suite and club levels higher up and replacing the existing suites with new luxury suites. The new suites will also have access to enhanced dining options and hospitality spaces in addition to their own dedicated concourse, National Tennis Center Chief Operating Office Daniel Zausner said Monday.
He added that the project will reduce the number of seats in the upper loge and promenade by about 2,800, reducing the overall capacity of Arthur Ashe by up to 200 seats.
The work will also significantly expand the concourse for fans in the loge and promenade, expanding concourse space by 40% and increasing the number of retail options by 30%.
Zausner added that the project will increase the number of restrooms for promenade and loge guests by about 30% while also adding doubling the number of escalators and elevators in the stadium from two to four. Meanwhile, the project will also include an overlook bar on the newly-expanded concourse, offering views out over the US Open complex toward the Unisphere in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.
Zausner said the redevelopment of Ashe will “exponentially” improve the experience of fans in the stadium's upper levels by reducing the number of guests and adding more services. He noted that the loge and promenade areas currently make up more than 19,000 seats at Ashe and said the redesign will help bring fans closer to the action.

Plans also include a brand-new “visually-striking” grand entrance to the famous stadium.

The $550 million redevelopment of the iconic tennis stadium will be carried out by Rossetti, the architect firm behind the original construction of Arthur Ashe Stadium in 1997.







Meanwhile, the planned Player Performance Center will be built on the top two floors of a new four-story building on the west side of Arthur Ashe, providing players with expansive locker rooms, lounges, dining areas, a new player-only café and a dedicated entrance for players entering the US Open complex. It will also include indoor and outdoor fitness and warmup areas, featuring turf, track and US Open court surfaces for training.
The $250 million center will be housed above a two-story parking lot within the new four-story building.

Zausner noted that only eight to ten players would be playing on Ashe on a given day during the US Open and said the Player Performance Center is an effort to cater to all players and their staff. He said close to 2,800 players and members of their teams attend the event every year.







Tennis legend John McEnroe, a four-time winner at the US Open, said the new performance center would be a big hit among the players, adding that he experiences a pang of jealously when he sees the facilities available to modern-day pros.
“The players are going to love this,” McEnroe said Monday. “There's a twinge of jealousy and envy, but it's also pride, because, in a way, I'd like to think that we've all been part of this in a certain way.
“New York City is the greatest city in the world, and it only makes sense to have the greatest and biggest and the best.”
McEnroe also praised the USTA for enhancing the experience for guests in the loge and promenade portions of Ashe, stating that it is these fans who bring the energy during the famous night events on the iconic court.







“They're the diehards. They're bringing the energy,” McEnroe said. “There's no way anyone can tell you that Arthur Ashe is not rocking at night – it's rocking hard.”
Construction on the redevelopment of Arthur Ashe is already underway, with structural work reinforcing the column load for the venue ongoing since last fall. Officials said the work is mostly structural and will not be noticeable to fans attending the 2025 US Open but said it will allow the USTA to increase the concourse sizes across 2026 and 2027.
Phase Two of the project will take place between the 2025 and 2026 US Opens, with the USTA set to expand the courtside bowl before the 2026 event in addition to replacing existing clubs and suites with modern luxury suites.
The final projects in Arthur Ashe Stadium will be completed ahead of the 2027 US Open, including the completion of the new concourse for loge and promenade guests. The new grand entrance, designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, will also be completed ahead of the 2027 tournament.
Meanwhile, the USTA has already completed the first two stories of the new Player Performance Center, introducing a two-story parking lot ahead of the 2025 tournament. The center will be constructed ahead of the 2026 US Open but will not be accessible to players until 2027, with interior work set to be carried out between 2026 and 2027.
USTA officials said the work would not impact capacity or fan experience at Arthur Ashe Stadium over the next three years.
Asked if the $800 investment would result in a hike in prices for guests, Sherr pointed to expansions of Fan Week, a free week-long event that takes place in the week leading up to the main draw of the US Open. He said the event has been expanded significantly in recent years, noticing that fans will have free access to the mixed doubles championship for 2025.
He also stated that USTA underprices and subsidizes a significant number of tickets to make the event more affordable for more people.
“It's a mix. We are a major global sporting event, and for the best access at the later end of the tournament, the prices get quite high. We don't back away from that,” Sherr said. “We feel great about the value that we deliver to fans, and the marketplace certainly speaks with their with their wallets.”
Sherr said the project, which will be funded from USTA reserves and debt leveraged against anticipated profits from the planned redevelopment, will help the USTA to re-invest more money back into tennis across the United States.
He said tennis has experienced five years of continued growth in the US, moving from 17.7 million players in 2019 to almost 26 million players last year.
However, he said the growth has been so quick that there are now not enough coaches and courts to support people who want to get lessons and learn how to play the sport.
Sherr said the $800 million investment will help USTA reach its goal of reaching 35 million players across the country by 2035.
“Our investments are being redirected to make sure that we continue to support growth,” Sherr said. “These investments in the Open will allow us to generate profits into the future and maintain the profits that we have into the future to support the general mission.”
Zausner, on the other hand, said the redevelopment of Ashe would also represent the “rebirth” of the famous stadium to coincide with its 30th anniversary in 2027.
“When you come back in 2027 for the 30th anniversary, you will see a brand new Arthur Ashe stadium, both on the inside and outside,” Zausner said.

“New York City is the greatest city in the world, and it only makes sense to have the greatest and biggest and the best.”
McEnroe also praised the USTA for enhancing the experience for guests in the loge and promenade portions of Ashe, stating that it is these fans who bring the energy during the famous night events on the iconic court.







“They're the diehards. They're bringing the energy,” McEnroe said. “There's no way anyone can tell you that Arthur Ashe is not rocking at night – it's rocking hard.”
Construction on the redevelopment of Arthur Ashe is already underway, with structural work reinforcing the column load for the venue ongoing since last fall. Officials said the work is mostly structural and will not be noticeable to fans attending the 2025 US Open but said it will allow the USTA to increase the concourse sizes across 2026 and 2027.
Phase Two of the project will take place between the 2025 and 2026 US Opens, with the USTA set to expand the courtside bowl before the 2026 event in addition to replacing existing clubs and suites with modern luxury suites.
The final projects in Arthur Ashe Stadium will be completed ahead of the 2027 US Open, including the completion of the new concourse for loge and promenade guests. The new grand entrance, designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, will also be completed ahead of the 2027 tournament.
Meanwhile, the USTA has already completed the first two stories of the new Player Performance Center, introducing a two-story parking lot ahead of the 2025 tournament. The center will be constructed ahead of the 2026 US Open but will not be accessible to players until 2027, with interior work set to be carried out between 2026 and 2027.
USTA officials said the work would not impact capacity or fan experience at Arthur Ashe Stadium over the next three years.
Asked if the $800 investment would result in a hike in prices for guests, Sherr pointed to expansions of Fan Week, a free week-long event that takes place in the week leading up to the main draw of the US Open. He said the event has been expanded significantly in recent years, noticing that fans will have free access to the mixed doubles championship for 2025.
He also stated that USTA underprices and subsidizes a significant number of tickets to make the event more affordable for more people.
“It's a mix. We are a major global sporting event, and for the best access at the later end of the tournament, the prices get quite high. We don't back away from that,” Sherr said. “We feel great about the value that we deliver to fans, and the marketplace certainly speaks with their with their wallets.”
Sherr said the project, which will be funded from USTA reserves and debt leveraged against anticipated profits from the planned redevelopment, will help the USTA to re-invest more money back into tennis across the United States.
He said tennis has experienced five years of continued growth in the US, moving from 17.7 million players in 2019 to almost 26 million players last year.
However, he said the growth has been so quick that there are now not enough coaches and courts to support people who want to get lessons and learn how to play the sport.
Sherr said the $800 million investment will help USTA reach its goal of reaching 35 million players across the country by 2035.
“Our investments are being redirected to make sure that we continue to support growth,” Sherr said. “These investments in the Open will allow us to generate profits into the future and maintain the profits that we have into the future to support the general mission.”
Zausner, on the other hand, said the redevelopment of Ashe would also represent the “rebirth” of the famous stadium to coincide with its 30th anniversary in 2027.
“When you come back in 2027 for the 30th anniversary, you will see a brand new Arthur Ashe stadium, both on the inside and outside,” Zausner said.

		
	

Zausner added that the project will increase the number of restrooms for promenade and loge guests by about 30% while also adding doubling the number of escalators and elevators in the stadium from two to four. Meanwhile, the project will also include an overlook bar on the newly-expanded concourse, offering views out over the US Open complex toward the Unisphere in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.

Zausner said the redevelopment of Ashe will “exponentially” improve the experience of fans in the stadium's upper levels by reducing the number of guests and adding more services. He noted that the loge and promenade areas currently make up more than 19,000 seats at Ashe and said the redesign will help bring fans closer to the action.

Plans also include a brand-new “visually-striking” grand entrance to the famous stadium.

The $550 million redevelopment of the iconic tennis stadium will be carried out by Rossetti, the architect firm behind the original construction of Arthur Ashe Stadium in 1997.







Meanwhile, the planned Player Performance Center will be built on the top two floors of a new four-story building on the west side of Arthur Ashe, providing players with expansive locker rooms, lounges, dining areas, a new player-only café and a dedicated entrance for players entering the US Open complex. It will also include indoor and outdoor fitness and warmup areas, featuring turf, track and US Open court surfaces for training.
The $250 million center will be housed above a two-story parking lot within the new four-story building.

Zausner noted that only eight to ten players would be playing on Ashe on a given day during the US Open and said the Player Performance Center is an effort to cater to all players and their staff. He said close to 2,800 players and members of their teams attend the event every year.







Tennis legend John McEnroe, a four-time winner at the US Open, said the new performance center would be a big hit among the players, adding that he experiences a pang of jealously when he sees the facilities available to modern-day pros.

The French Open is less than a week away and plenty of players are still hoping to fine-tune their games ahead of the second Grand Slam tournament of the season. Emma Raducanu took a late wildcard into this week's WTA 500 in Strasbourg and it more than paid off - she stunned No. 6 seed Daria Kasatkina in the first round and later opened up about her relationship with the surface.

Novak Djokovic is still seeking his first win on the clay in 2025. The three-time French Open champion lost his opening matches in Monte-Carlo and Madrid, then pulled out of the Italian Open. He is now competing in the ATP 250 event in Geneva, his first appearance since ending his coaching partnership with Andy Murray.

Meanwhile, Rafael Nadal is preparing to return to Roland Garros this weekend. The 14-time champion will be back on Court Philippe-Chatrier for the first time since ending his professional career last year.

Novak Djokovic has revealed that he is not in need of a new coach following his split from Andy Murray.

The Serbian has endured a tough start to the season and hopes to bounce back to form at the French Open without the help of a new coach.

He said: “At the moment, I'm not in need of a coach. I don't need to rush in any context. I feel comfortable with the people around me ... in the next few tournaments, and we'll see what happens."

Former world No.1 and Rafael Nadal's former coach Carlos Moya is reportedly set to join Jannik Sinner's coaching team in 2026.

According to Russian media outlet Bolshe, Sinner is set to begin working with Rafael Nadal's former coach Moya in 2026.

Moya kickstarted his coaching career by joining Nadal's team in 2016 before stepping up as his sole coach when Toni Nadal stepped down from his position. During that time, they won six Grand Slam titles and continued to work together until Nadal retired from the sport.

Dan Evans came out on top in a battle of the Brits in French Open qualifying.

The former world No. 21 beat countryman Billy Harris 7-5 6-3.

Harris was the No. 6 seed in the qualifying draw.

Retired tennis legend Chris Evert has told Express Sport that coaching Novak Djokovic would have been an "intimidating" task for Andy Murray.

Djokovic and Murray ended their player-coach partnership last week, and the 18-time Major winner believes the Brit couldn't give Djokovic an "edge".

"How do you coach Novak, the greatest player of all time? How do you coach him? I think it's a very… intimidating job to be a coach of Novak Djokovic. And I don't know if Andy could give him the edge he needed," she said.

Marie Bouzkova's Strasbourg campaign came to an unfortunate end on Tuesday as she was forced to retire injured just 47 minutes into her second-round match.

The Czech star lost in qualifying but entered the main draw as a lucky loser and easily beat wildcard Alize Cornet in the first round.

But she couldn't continue against No. 3 seed Paula Badosa, calling it quits at 3-3 in the first set of their match.



Sara Errani partnered up with Jasmine Paolini to win the Italian Open women's doubles title on Sunday afternoon.

And less than 48 hours later, she's scored an impressive win in French Open singles qualifying.

The 38-year-old stormed back after being bagelled by Jule Niemeier, beating the 19th seed 0-6 7-6(4) 6-2.

Daniil Medvedev has entered the men's doubles draw at the upcoming French Open.

The singles world No. 11 appeared on the doubles entry list alongside Brazilian player Marcelo Demoliner.

It will be his first Grand Slam doubles participation since 2017.

Britain's Fran Jones scored a win in French Open qualifying, beating Lea Boskovic 6-2 6-3.

Danielle Collins caused a huge shock at the Italian Open earlier this month, taking out defending champion Iga Swiatek in the third round.

But the American has admitted that the big win wasn't all it cracked up to be, as her form was overlooked.

"I thought I played really well against Iga. I didn't get a ton of credit for it after the match, of course," she told T2.

"It was more about how poorly she played and everything. That can make it difficult to celebrate your win sometimes when you feel like you've played a good match and it's just like ugh whatever. I was happy about it, but it wasn't as fun as I imagined."

There's been a massive upset on day two of French Open qualifying, as top seed Borna Coric lost his opening match.

A former world No. 12, Coric currently sits at No. 83 in the world and came into qualies in form after winning the Aix-en-Provence Challenger.

But he suffered a 5-7 7-6(9) 6-2 defeat to France's Titouan Droguet on Tuesday, blowing two match points in the second set.

It's been a strange season for Daniil Medvedev, who dropped out of the top 10 and has not won a title since the 2023 Italian Open.

A former world No. 1 and Grand Slam champion, Medvedev has failed to rediscover his best tennis in recent months. But he believes he could be close.

"At the best moments of my career, my game was based on counterattacking, especially on returns," he told Bolshe.

"I feel like I'm close to finding things on clay that will help me regain my best level on other surfaces. My goal is to be able to beat players like Ruud or Musetti, and I think I can achieve that if I keep working hard."

It's been a tough day for the Brits so far in French Open qualifying.

Heather Watson suffered a 7-6(2) 6-2 defeat to good friend Daria Saville.

Jan Choinski also crashed out with a 6-4 7-6(5) loss to Italy's Giulio Zeppieri.

Fran Jones is currently in action while Brits Billy Harris and Dan Evans will face off later on Tuesday.

Novak Djokovic will take on Marton Fucsovics at the Geneva Open.

The Serb is yet to win a match on the clay this season, losing early in Monte-Carlo and Madrid before pulling out of the Italian Open.

He then entered this week's ATP 250 event in a bid to get more matches before the French Open.

Djokovic is the No. 2 seed in Geneva and received a first-round bye, while Fucsovics took out Zizou Bergs 6-2 6-3 in his opening match.

Djokovic has a perfect 5-0 record against the former world No. 31. He also competed in Geneva last year and reached the semi-final, losing to Tomas Machac.

Darren Cahill has spoken out after Jannik Sinner suffered a 7-6 6-1 defeat to Carlos Alcaraz in the Italian Open final.

Sinner was making his return from a three-month suspension and won five matches in a row, dropping only one srt to reach the final. But Alcaraz proved too strong.

Cahill took to Instagram to congraulate Alcaraz and his team before sending a message to Sinner.

"An amazing fortnight in Italy for all of us. Well done Jan. Exceeding expectations has become your norm, which is far from normal," he wrote.



Barbora Krejcikova has finally returned to competition for the first time since November.

The Czech star lifted her second Grand Slam title at Wimbledon last summer but she had not played a match since the 2024 WTA Finals, pulling out of several tournaments with a back injury.

She made her comeback in Strasbourg this week but lost her opening match to Magda Linette, though she was just happy to be on court.

"It was very difficult times last year with all that happened, all the ups and downs. Feeling good. Happy to be back," she told the WTA.

"If I finish the week and I'm pain-free with my back, that's my main goal."

There are plenty of questions surrounding Iga Swiatek coming into the French Open.

The Pole is a four-time champion at Roland Garros and has not lost a match there since 2021. But it's been almost a year since she last lifted a trophy and she has dropped to No. 5 in the world following a shock early exit in Rome.

However, French Open tournament director and two-time Major winner Amelie Mauresmo believes Swiatek is still dangerous in Paris.

"Iga on this court is always dangerous. She's always going to be a problem to any player she's going to face," she told Eurosport France.

"Now, the fact that she's coming here with confidence being pretty low is probably something new for her. It's also going to be interesting to see how she reacts to this mentally."



Nick Kyrgios has played just four events since returning from a two-year injury layoff on January but the Aussie is now set to ramp things up and will head back to west London for the grass-court season.

The former world No. 13 has signed up to the ATP 500 event at Queen's using his protected ranking of No. 21.

He is also set to compete in French Open doubles with Jordan Thompson before returning to singles action at the ATP 250 in Stuttgart.

Rafael Nadal will be back at Roland Garros this weekend for a special ceremony following the conclusion of the day session matches on Court Philippe-Chatrier on Sunday.

The 22-time Major winner has laid low since retiring during the Davis Cup Finals in November but he wanted to return to the most successful tournament of his career.

"I'm not much for tributes, but Roland Garros is obviously the most important place in my career, without a doubt," he told TNT ahead of the ceremont.

"So, if something big is to be done, it has to be there, or at least give them priority to do it there."

Emma Raducanu got off to a triumphant start in Strasbourg on Monday afternoon, upsetting world No. 17 Daria Kasatkina 6-1 6-3.

The Brit is still relatively inexperienced on the clay but she confessed her "relationship" with the surface was improving.

"I think I've been building towards this. I had three great matches in Rome and to bring that level here, I'm really proud," she said.

"As I spend more time on clay I'm starting to like it more and more and building my relationship, let's say, with the surface."

For four and a half months last year, I did not touch a racquet. It was not for a reason you might expect, though.

It was because of my mental health. 

When it was bad, I started to forget things. My body was in one place, but my mind was somewhere else. It would go from something as simple as nearly forgetting my racquets to suffering panic attacks.

I knew it was going too far at Roland Garros, because what was happening in my head at tournaments began affecting my life outside the court. I could not sleep well to the point that I started having nightmares. I would wake up sweating with my heart pounding, and I couldn't breathe. It made me think I was going crazy.

I would wake up in the morning and go to practice, but I was not there. It became a matter of going through the motions. When it came time for my first-round match in Paris, it felt like I was not really on the court. I was not present except for my feet on the clay, so it was no surprise that I lost in straight sets.

I tried to take one or two weeks off to see if that would help before heading to Surbiton for an ATP Challenger Tour event on grass. Instead, I actually had a panic attack on court. I would tell you what it felt like, but I don't really remember the match. 

As you can imagine, these things were very scary. I started to have panic attacks off the court, including when I was driving. During Wimbledon, I needed to pull off the road, stop and get out of the car because it sometimes felt like I could pass out. I had no control. 

Somehow I made the third round of the tournament, but for half of my match against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, I mentally blacked out. I just remember wanting to run off the court. 

It was an absurd place to be — I was playing at one of the events I dreamt of competing in as a kid and all I wanted was to be somewhere else or somebody else.

Soon enough, I knew something had to change. Enough was enough.



#  #  #

The first time I spoke to a professional about my mental health was about 10 years ago, but my struggles became an issue more recently. 

Three years ago in Miami was the first time that I experienced a real panic attack. There is such a thin line between feeling normal nerves and something more. It is normal to be nervous for a match — you might start sweating, for example. Everybody has it different and that comes with sports, or really any profession. But this was something different. 

One morning in Florida I woke up and felt like somebody was strangling me. It was impossible to breathe. It was like somebody was stepping on my chest. 

We got in the car to head to the site and I couldn't speak. My mind was going crazy with a million thoughts swirling around. 

By the time we arrived, I was shaking. At that point, I was barely able to hold back tears long enough to tell my coach that I was not okay. I felt so terrible and did not know what was going on.

Somehow I was able to calm down a bit, went on court to face Maxime Cressy and won the match. Afterwards, I talked about it a little bit with my team, but not that much. I continued moving along. 

Once I stepped on the court, I was able to just switch it off and just focus on tennis. A couple of days later I pushed Jannik Sinner to a final-set tie-break. Nobody would have known what I had gone through.

I had recently made my first ATP Tour final in Pune and the following year I reached a career-high No. 37 in the PIF ATP Rankings. I was doing pretty well despite it all.

Part of the problem is that I learned the way to have success on the tennis court, and then I just followed that as long as it lasted. I was just keeping my mouth shut. Something was wrong, but I just continued doing what I had done for so many years. It was what allowed me to play tennis across the world, so it made sense, right?

Being a professional athlete, you try to survive any issues, forget them and just leave them behind in the hopes they go away. I was somehow able to do it, and that is the cruel part of sports. 

After Wimbledon last year, I started with a new team and attempted to play in Washington. When I went to bed, I started to have this feeling that there was someone else in the room. There was a kind of fear, a feeling that someone was there trying to harm me.

I beat Borna Coric in three tough sets, but the tennis was not the most difficult part. On match point against Borna, I thought in my head whether I should just double fault so that I could get out of there.

I traveled to Montreal but withdrew citing the stomach flu, but it was really because of my mind. I decided that was enough. I did not touch a racquet for four and a half months after that and some of those days were the toughest.

For the past 10 years, life was so consistent. There was always the next match, the next tournament. Everything was always moving and suddenly I did not have that anymore. That was a shock, because suddenly it was so boring and there was nothing to do.

I didn't really feel joy in anything anymore. I wasn't competing on court, and now I was fighting to get out of bed and honestly even had thoughts about whether I wanted to live, which was very scary. Even worse was how this affected those closest to me and how worried it made them.

I could not go on a tennis court, especially in Finland. I did not want to see people involved in tennis because I could not answer their questions. It was just a difficult situation.








Something that helped was playing quite a bit of padel. I felt like the two hours that I played were the only ones when I didn't think about anything else. I learned how important it was to have some things that interested me.

During the summer I began speaking to my psychologist once a week and told my very close family and friends what I was dealing with, which helped. One of my closest friends went through something similar, which made me realise that I was not alone in this. That gave me perspective.

That is a big reason why I decided to tell my story earlier this month on video in Finnish. It is very interesting to me to have this conversation with different people, trying to bring awareness to getting rid of this notion that it is somehow weak to talk about mental health. Everybody has these moments. It is about how you handle them.

When the video was released, it was like a weight dropped off my shoulders, because I felt like I was always pretending in front of people. It was so difficult. I could not do it anymore. I didn't feel like I could be honest and that was weighing on me.

I received a lot of very positive messages. Many different people with different jobs commented and you could see that it doesn't matter what you do. Everybody has their own struggles they need to overcome. Some people said it was brave of me that I did it and it helped them, and that meant a lot to me.

A good thing going through this process is that I became okay with the idea that I might not play again. Before that was not even an option. Everything was about my tennis and my career. But still, I always had the idea that I would come back. That wasn't even a question, it was just a matter of time. 

It took a while to get my body ready to be able to compete again, and my first tournament back was in February at an ATP Challenger Tour event in Tenerife. The first match was horrendous. It was just so difficult to be on court. The second one was a little bit better, but they have been up and down since.

It is still not always easy. Last month I went to South Korea and had one of my worst panic attacks. I woke up in the morning and my heart was beating way too fast. Before the match, I was in the shower and still felt so weird. My heart was like a car that was revving way too many RPMs. I was sitting and my heartbeat was 100 RPMs, and my normal resting heartbeat is around 37. That was not very good and you start questioning if it is worth it.

The difference is that now I just have the ability to help myself in these moments. When the thoughts start coming and going over the top, I have more tools to calm myself down. 

I was able to make my dream come true and become a tennis player. Because I achieved that goal, I had the mindset that I should just do whatever it took to keep moving forward. I didn't really talk about any mental problems because I saw them as a weakness. That's maybe the key word. It was something I felt didn't exist in sports and allowing anyone to see me vulnerable was showing that I was not strong enough.

I think the biggest change in me now is that if I don't want to be on court, I'm not going to force myself. You have to, a little bit, of course. You can't feel good every day in sports — that's not the point. It is a struggle, you need to overcome these challenges. But you just need to feel like there's at least some purpose and passion for it and then you can do it.

If my story helps even one person, then it will be worth it. My main hope is for people to know that you should take care of your mind and look after yourselves. That is the key. If you're not okay, there is no more important thing than helping yourself. Don't keep everything inside of you. 

It is okay to be sad. It is okay to have a bad day. But always remember one thing: tough times don't last forever.

Borna Coric has been lighting it up on the ATP Challenger Tour this season, picking up four titles to rebuild his ranking inside the Top 100.The Croatian's ongoing resurgence didn't time favorably enough with Roland Garros, leaving him as the top qualifying seed. And on Tuesday, the former world No. 12 suffered a tough opening blow.Local hopeful Titouan Droguet, ranked No. 232, rose to the occasion inside Court Suzanne-Lenglen with a 5-7, 7-6 (9), 6-2 victory. Having failed to serve out the second set at 5-3, the 23-year-old later staved off two match points in the eventual tie-break before pulling away from Coric.

After two hours and 37 minutes, the hard-fought win belonged to Droguet.

Compatriot Arthur Gea is up next.For Coric, this marked the first time he lost in the first round of a major qualifying draw since 2014 Wimbledon as a 17-year-old.

And on Tuesday, the former world No. 12 suffered a tough opening blow.Local hopeful Titouan Droguet, ranked No. 232, rose to the occasion inside Court Suzanne-Lenglen with a 5-7, 7-6 (9), 6-2 victory. Having failed to serve out the second set at 5-3, the 23-year-old later staved off two match points in the eventual tie-break before pulling away from Coric.

After two hours and 37 minutes, the hard-fought win belonged to Droguet. The Frenchman is aiming to get through to the main draw of his home major for the first time and second Grand Slam event overall, after ousting Lorenzo Musetti at the 2023 US Open following a successful qualification in Queens. Compatriot Arthur Gea is up next.For Coric, this marked the first time he lost in the first round of a major qualifying draw since 2014 Wimbledon as a 17-year-old. His current No. 84 ranking should give him enough padding with impending Roland Garros results to earn a main-draw spot at the All England Club.Eliot Spizzirri survived a three-hour plus battle thanks in part to a stunning turn of events. The No. 15 seed edged Hugo Greiner, 7-6 (6), 4-6, 7-6 (10-5), but not before recovering from 0-6 down in the opening tiebreaker on a 13-point run that carried over into the second set.

NICK KYRGIOS has sparked controversy by posing for pictures with Aussie rapper Ay Huncho.

Huncho, real name Ali Younes, was bailed for AU$1.8million (£860k) following charges of alleged kidnapping and assault.

The rapper is said to have ties with the Alameddine crime syndicate.

Ay Huncho has been accused of being part of a group that lured a man to a drug house before "ambushing" them.

The man was said to have been forced into the property's garage before being left unconscious by an assault.

It was later heard in court that the victim did not co-operate with police, despite being left hospitalised with serious injuries.

Ay Huncho is alleged to have been heard laughing about the kidnapping in an audio tape.

There is nothing to suggest that Kyrgios has any ties to the Alameddine crime syndicate.

Per The Daily Telegraph AU, Kyrgios and Ay Huncho were pictured together on May 9 at Fiction nightclub in Canberra.

Kyrgios, 30, is claimed to have captioned the image: "Keep waiting on it @ayhuncho."

The post has since been deleted.

As part of Ay Huncho's bail conditions, he has been able to continue his tour of Australia.

He is set to perform in Adelaide on May 30.

Kyrgios, meanwhile, is looking to reignite his tennis career.

Having been plagued by a wrist injury, the former Wimbledon finalist has won just one tour match since October 2022.

Last year the Aussie worked at the All-England Club as a BBC pundit.

Kyrgios has not played since losing to Karen Khachanov in Miami two months ago.

The former world No13 is set to return to action at Roland Garros, playing alongside compatriot Jordan Thompson in the doubles event.

Earlier this year, Kyrgios split with long-term girlfriend Costeen Hatzi.

Having broken up with Kyrgios following four years together, Costeen said: "We haven't spoken. Relationships sometimes end, and I believe it's for the best."



Off the court, Kyrgios has built up his "Good Trouble" podcast.

The tennis star has confirmed that he will perform live at Wimbledon Theatre ahead of this year's Championships.

This new project will add 2,000 seats and two new luxury suites to the iconic tennis arena.

The United States Tennis Association (USTA) has announced a major $800 million investment into New York City's  Billie Jean King National Tennis Center hub, which includes a “top-to-bottom” refurbishment of the iconic Arthur Ashe Stadium.

The venue, which hosts tennis' annual US Open, one of the sport's four Grand Slam majors, will be refurbished in stages so as not to disturb the 2025 and 2026 stagings of the iconic event, with construction set for completion for the start of the 2027 US Open.


                        The gold standard of business intelligence.

Architecture firm Rossetti, the architects of the Arthur Ashe Stadium in its original form and the firm behind its 2018 revamp, will once again lead the modernization of the venue.

For the Arthur Ashe Stadium, already the world's largest tennis-specific arena, this will mean an expanded capacity with 2,000 more seats, luxury hospitality suites, and a 40% larger concourse with expanded food and drink, retail, and dining offerings around the venue also planned.

Elsewhere at the Tennis Centre, a new $250 million player performance center will be constructed to aid player development and enhance the experience of top-level athletes competing at the event.

This investment will be entirely funded by the USTA, with no public funding required, with USTA chief executive and executive director Lew Sherr stating: “This project enables us to maintain the greatest stage in tennis—Arthur Ashe Stadium—which was constructed more than 25 years ago, and modernize it in a way that will set it up for the next 25 years.”

As tennis has grown in recent years, so too has the US Open, which in 2024 attracted a record attendance of over one million fans for the first time.

The 1,048,669 total over three weeks marks an 8% increase over 2023, itself a record-breaking year, while attendance for the two weeks of 2024's main draw reached a new high of 832,640.

This made the 2024 championships at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center the first to surpass the seven-figure mark.

The 2024 edition was the first to feature a seven-day US Open Fan Week, which was attended by over 219,000 fans, featuring signature events and activities each day and night of the week.

A year prior, in 2023, a record TV audience was measured, with 3.4 million viewers on ESPN tuning in to watch US star Coco Gauff's maiden US Open victory, he most-watched women's final of all time on major sports broadcaster ESPN.

The men's final that year, a record-setting victory for Novak Djokovic, drew 2.3 million viewers, which was the most-watched men's final since 2019.

Though the 2024 edition fared less well, with the men's final notching 1.7 million viewers and the women's final 1.8 million, a carriage dispute between ESPN owner Disney and cable TV service DirecTV saw the pay-TV sports channel pulled from DirecTV amid the final week of the tournament, adversely affecting viewership.

When fans take in the sights and sounds of the qualifying rounds at the French Open at Roland Garros, they will see at least one well-known player participating: former US Open champion Marin Čilić. The 36-year-old Croatian, who peaked at No. 3 in the world rankings, won the 2014 US Open, and reached two more Grand Slam finals, is set to achieve a rare feat when he takes the court against Yibing Wu. Cilic is one of only two players—men's or women's singles—who have won a Grand Slam and later in their career taken part in Grand Slam qualifying rounds. Both instances occurred at the French Open.

The other example is 2010 French Open champion (and 2011 finalist) Francesca Schiavone, who had her best career results on clay. In 2018, her final year on tour, Schiavone's ranking had dropped enough to require her to enter the qualifying rounds. She successfully advanced to the main draw but lost in the first round to Viktoria Kuzmova in straight sets. Schiavone ended her career at age 37 with three consecutive first-round exits in Paris, despite her overall best Slam results being at Roland Garros. Her decline was notable: after reaching the 2011 French Open final, she never again advanced past the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam. This underappreciated grinder had largely faded from the spotlight following her memorable four weeks in Paris in 2010 and 2011.

Cilic's decline in form and ranking has not been as steep. His best result at the French Open actually came late in his career—in 2022, when he reached the semifinals after two previous quarterfinal appearances. His career prime spanned from 2014 to 2018, during which his aggressive style excelled on faster surfaces. It often took the skill of Roger Federer to prevent him from winning multiple majors. While injuries and age have slowed Cilic's career, his veteran knowledge of clay—gained from numerous battles against the likes of Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros—makes him one of the favorites to qualify and potentially cause an upset in the main draw. Cilic did win a Challenger Title in 2025, and set a record in the process, as it was nearly 18 years between Challenger titles.

Cilic's 2022 run saw him defeat Russian stars Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev, and in the third round, home favorite Gilles Simon, before taking a set off Casper Ruud and losing the semifinal in four sets. His win over Rublev came in a 5th set tiebreak that set the crowd alight for the intensity of the tennis and the upset nature of the result.

Hailing from Croatia, and never one of the flashiest names on the ATP Tour, Cilic hasn't enjoyed as many wildcard opportunities as other veterans with similar credentials. For example, two players of Cilic's generation—former Slam champion Stan Wawrinka and French favorite Richard Gasquet—both received main draw wildcards in Paris, but no such opportunity was available for Cilic. Recent retirees like Andy Murray, and Rafael Nadal, and other historical names like Lleyton Hewitt consistently received wild cards if they couldn't secure direct entry, while Cilic's countryman Goran Ivanišević notably won Wimbledon in 2001 as a wild card, a wild card he received due to his strong past performances on grass and at the Wimbledon tournament.

Fans will be watching closely to see if Cilic can conjure some magic in the earliest rounds of the French Open, where only the most dedicated tennis followers pay attention. You can't help but root for the likable and determined Cilic as he grinds through the twilight of his career.

Australia's 15-strong band of hopefuls in French Open qualifying has been trimmed by a third after the first day at Roland Garros. Bernard Tomic led three players into the second round, but five lost with seven still to enter the fray.

Jason Kubler and Maddison Inglis also won in Paris as they seek to join the 14 Aussies already guaranteed a place in the main draws. Qualifiers need to win three matches to secure their places.

Tomic, who has not competed in a grand slam main draw match since the 2021 Australian Open, beat Hong Kong's Coleman Wong 7-6 (7-2), 6-3. Once ranked No 17 in the world, Tomic is now a lowly 236rd.

Kubler, who has battled back to 210 in the rankings after missing most of 2024 with injury, scrapped his way past Spain's Alejandro Moro Canas 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 and Inglis took little more than an hour to dispense with Iryna Shymanovich 6-1, 6-1.

However, two men and three women went out on Monday.

Local wildcard Mathys Erhard beat James Mccabe 6-1, 6-1; Alex Bolt lost 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 to Pablo Llamas Ruiz; Arina Rodionova suffered a 6-2, 6-2 defeat to Czech teenager Tereza Valentova; Taylah Preston went down to American veteran Varvara Lepchenko, who at 38 is twice her age, 6-4, 7-5; and Priscilla Hon was narrowly beaten by Croatia's Jana Fett 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (12-10) in a draining two hours 45 minutes.

Playing their opening round matches on Tuesday will be Lizette Cabrera, Talia Gibson, Storm Hunter, Astra Sharma, Daria Saville, Li Tu and Omar Jasika.

Among other matches in qualifying former world No 4 and 2019 US Open winner Bianca Andreescu of Canada beat China's Xinxin Yao 6-0, 6-0.

Elsewhere, Daria Kasatkina's preparations for Paris were upset when she lost 6-1, 6-3 to former US Open champ Emma Raducanu in the first round in Strasbourg. But Ajla Tomljanovic gained an encouraging win in Morocco, beating fifth-seed Viktoriya Tomova 7-5, 4-6, 6-3.

Due to overwhelming popularity, with sold-out screenings in 25 markets across the globe, Warner Bros. Pictures and IMAX have announced they are expanding their Fan-First Premiere Screenings of Apple Original Films' F1 The Movie to 400 IMAX houses worldwide.

Fans who take advantage of this opportunity will get to see the event film of the summer for one night only on 23 June, days ahead of it launching internationally from 25 June and across the US on 27 June. Tickets go on sale tomorrow, 21 May at 9am PT/5pm BST for these Fan-First Premiere Screenings in IMAX and can be found here.

Tickets will also go on general sale tomorrow at 9am PT/5pm BST for all available showtimes of the film when it lands in theatres later that week. Check local listings for available showtimes from June 25 and beyond.

The new film stars Brad Pitt, is directed by Joseph Kosinski and is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, Kosinski, seven-time Formula 1 World Champion Lewis Hamilton, Pitt, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner and Chad Oman.

F1 | Main Trailer

Dubbed “the greatest that never was,” Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) was Formula 1's most promising phenom of the 1990s until an accident on the track nearly ended his career.

Thirty years later, he's a nomadic racer-for-hire when he's approached by his former team mate Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), the owner of a struggling Formula 1 team that is on the verge of collapse. Ruben convinces Sonny to come back to Formula 1 for one last shot at saving the team and being the best in the world.

He'll drive alongside Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), the team's hotshot rookie intent on setting his own pace. But as the engines roar, Sonny's past catches up with him and he finds that in Formula 1, your team mate is your fiercest competition—and the road to redemption is not something you can travel alone.

F1 The Movie also stars Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies and Kim Bodnia, and was shot during actual Grand Prix weekends as the team competed against the titans of the sport.

Javier Bardem stars alongside Brad Pitt in the new film

Kosinski directs from a screenplay by Ehren Kruger, with the story by Kosinski & Kruger. The film is executive produced by Daniel Lupi. Collaborating with Kosinski behind the scenes are his creative team, including director of photography Claudio Miranda, production designers Mark Tildesley and Ben Munro, editor Stephen Mirrione, costume designer Julian Day, casting director Lucy Bevan and composer Hans Zimmer.

POWER RANKINGS: Who impressed our judges during an incident-packed weekend at Imola?

There has been a lot of intrigue recently about how an ingenious McLaren rear brake duct design is helping the MCL39 have better tyre temperature control than the others. At circuits which induce particularly high rear tyre temperatures, it has helped amplify McLaren's advantage.

Although the exact way the duct is configured internally is not yet widely known, the FIA has checked and confirmed that the design is in full compliance with the regulations and that it has no concerns about it.

EXCLUSIVE: Damien Chazelle's next film looks to have its sights sets on some serious star power as Deadline is hearing Cillian Murphy and Daniel Craig are in negotiations to star in the new, currently untitled pic from the Oscar-winning director. Chazelle will direct and has written the script and will also produce alongside Olivia Hamilton under their Wild Chickens Productions banner. Paramount Pictures will distribute the film. 


	While unconfirmed, insiders say the film will be set in a prison. 


	If deals end up closing for the two stars, production is expected to start later this year. Chazelle had been weighing several projects in recent months including an Evel Knievel pic with Leonardo DiCaprio circling the lead role. With the studio unable to make a deal for DiCaprio, Chazelle circled back to the prison drama as his next film.

	As with any Chazelle feature, A-list talent is always circling given his track record; this case was no different, with Murphy and Craig high on the project following a meeting with Chazelle.

	Murphy is coming off his Oscar-winning role in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer. He recently wrapped production on the Peaky Binders movie The Immortal Man at Netflix and was also recently seen in Small Things Like These.


	Craig was most recently seen in the A24 pic Queer, which earned him a Golden Globe nomination. Next up, he is set to reprise his role as Benoit Blanc in the upcoming Knives Out sequel Wake Up Dead Man, which will bow later this year on Netflix.


	Craig and Murphy are repped by CAA and Chazelle is repped by WME.

If longtime HGTV star Alison Victoria has her way, she'll “live forever and look damn good doing it.” 

That's what Victoria, 44, told Chicago Magazine in late April 2025, sharing multiple ways she's been working on improving her health and prioritizing her happiness. One big decision the “Windy City Rehab” star and current contestant on “Rock The Block” made in 2024 was to cut all alcohol out of her diet. 

“What we put in is what we get out,” she told the outlet. “That's the biggest reason I gave up alcohol eight months ago. My skin's never looked better, and my overall happiness is better, too. You know, some people use all the best lotions but drink a gallon of wine a night, and they look like hell. Beauty, health, and wellness all start from within.”

Victoria has been filming her new show, “Sin City Rehab,” in Las Vegas, expected to premiere sometime in 2025. At her homes there and in Chicago, she's installed her own Lagree M3 Megaformers, Pilates workout machines that cost nearly $7,000 each. 

“I wake up at 8 a.m. and go right into my home gym for my Lagree workout,” she told Chicago Magazine. “It's 45 minutes. I've got big gumballs in my gym, and I shove a couple of those in for a sugar rush. I started doing only Lagree a year and a half ago and ended up losing 10 pounds.”

Victoria has a sweet tooth, so she washed down all of her vitamins with a favorite brownie batter flavored FlavCity protein shake — and adds some BeautyLux Multi Collagen powder. 

“It's so good, I just mix it with water,” she said. “I have been through every single protein drink and powder, and this is, hands down, the best-tasting one.” 

When she's filming, Victoria told Chicago Magazine, she has “roasted red pepper egg white bites,” but nothing else for breakfast or lunch. Most nights, she said, she eats a wagyu rib eye steak with “salt, pepper, a little bit of butter, and rosemary.” 

“I make a little salad with romaine lettuce and garbanzo beans,” she added, but admitted to satisfy her sweet tooth, she always has candy on hand. 

“I also love candy so much,” she told the magazine. “Maybe it's because I was born on Halloween? Like, I'm a full candy freak. Last night I fell asleep eating Red Vines.”

Adding to Victoria's health and happiness is her relationship with filmmaker Brandt Andersen. 

Victoria went Instagram official with Andersen in June 2024, sharing multiple photos of them together at the Daytime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles. 

The couple has traveled all over the world together to promote “The Stranger's Case,” his feature film directorial debut, at film festivals where it's received critical acclaim. In early May, she celebrated that it will be released in theaters on Christmas Day. 

In November, she told Entertainment Tonight, “I've never felt, like, more safe. And that just is something I never have felt in my life. I've always just been someone that's like, ‘I got it. I'll do it myself.' You know? Like, forge ahead and armor up. And it's like I don't have to wear that armor with him. And I get to just be, like, my authentic, vulnerable, scared-little-girl self with him and he takes care of me.”

	Last year, the public heat around Chappell Roan intensified after she posted a series of TikToks hoping to clarify her stance on the presidential election after an interview quote was taken widely out of context. Each new video only gave viewers more to nitpick over. Some questioned why Roan wouldn't just let it go. Why not let people believe what they want, even if they're wrong? In a recent interview on TS Madison's Outlaws, the 26-year-old explained why defending herself and drawing boundaries is the only way she can continue being in the music industry. 


	“I cannot bear people saying I'm something I'm not. That's what's really hard online. People just assume you're the villain,” Roan said. The first intense wave of backlash came this past August when she set boundaries around her private and public personas. She communicated that while she was experiencing the most success of her career, she also had never felt more unsafe as she navigated harassment and stalking. She was, in turn, slammed for being entitled and ungrateful.

	











	On Outlaws, she likened the response to how Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and Paris Hilton were treated. “That behavior is still, they're still doing it,” she said. “Do you want me to just get to the point where I become agoraphobic? Or so stressed out, or so anxious to perform? You want me to get to that point? Because if I don't say anything, I will. If I do not stand up for myself, I will quit because I cannot bear this. I cannot bear people touching me who I don't know. I cannot bear people following me.”

	Roan referenced the popular X account Pop Crave, which posts the latest happenings in pop culture and often shares pull quotes from interviews published by established outlets, in a game of “Ban it, Bitch!” with Outlaws. Quite a few of the public's online fallouts with the singer began with posts from Pop Crave. It's not necessarily that the account itself is framing her in a bad light. Rather, it presents quotes that can be easily misconstrued without necessary context and allows users to have a field day in its quotes and comments sections like a pop star gladiator colosseum. 


	This treatment has followed Roan offline before, too. She's called out photographers on red carpets for yelling at her on more than one occasion, only to later be called a brat and a villain online. “I've been treated better at my doughnut shop job than I have on a fucking carpet,” Roan said. “People on the news treat me worse than how customers did. And I think when I started to say, ‘Don't talk to me like that' … That doesn't mean that I'm a villain or ungrateful for what I have. It's like, ‘Why is this customary?'”

Lanez was the victim of a prison stabbing last week.

	Michael Saponara



	Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida's 13th district is calling for Tory Lanez's freedom. The Republican urged California's Gov. Gavin Newsom to review the Toronto singer's 2020 shooting case and issue Lanez (born Daystar Peterson) a pardon in a message posted to X on Monday (May 19).


	“I am calling on Gov. Newsom @CAgovernor to review Tory Lanez's case and issue a pardon,” she wrote. “His 10-year sentence was based on flawed evidence, political pressure, and prosecutorial bias. Justice must be blind— not driven by headlines. Free Tory Lanez.”

	











	Lanez is currently serving a 10-year sentence after being convicted on three felony counts tied to shooting Megan Thee Stallion in the feet following a July 2020 party in Hidden Hills, Calif.

	Rep. Luna has also claimed via X on Tuesday (May 20) that new “compelling evidence” will be presented in the next 36 hours, which she believes will exonerate Lanez. “We have compelling evidence proving Tory Lanez's innocence, and it will be released within the next 36 hours,” she wrote. “Those who rushed to call for his incarceration, and worse yet pushed false evidence, should prepare to be held accountable.”


Billboard has reached out to Megan Thee Stallion's rep for comment on Luna's messages on X.


	Reps for Lanez from the Los Angeles nonprofit social justice organization Unite the People presented alleged new findings in Tory's case during a press conference last week. Attorney Walter Roberts claimed that Kelsey Harris' bodyguard, Bradley James, filed an affidavit claiming he overheard Harris admit to firing the weapon and not Lanez.


	Megan Thee Stallion's attorney, Alex Spiro, released a statement refuting Roberts' claims. “Tory Lanez was tried and convicted by a jury of his peers and his case was properly adjudicated through the court system,” he said. “This is not a political matter — this is a case of a violent assault that was resolved in the court of law.”


	The “Savage” rapper herself also slammed the claims of new evidence on Monday. “FACTS ARE FACTS, he did it , it was PROVEN IN COURT f–k the hate campaign on the internet TORY YOU SHOT ME !!” she wrote in a social media post. “Ain't no new f–king evidence yall been saying the same s–t for years.”


	Lanez was stabbed in prison on May 12 inside California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi. He was hospitalized for his injuries, and a statement posted hours later to his social media said he was stabbed 14 times, but was in “good spirits” while recovering. It also noted that his lungs had collapsed, but was breathing on his own at the time of the posting.

Darren Aronofsky has launched a new generative AI storytelling venture in which he will partner with Google DeepMind to produce short films with Gen-AI and some of Google's newly announced tools.

The venture is titled Primordial Soup, and its research team, along with three filmmakers, will produce short films integrating new tech and storytelling and has the mission statement of creating frameworks for AI's role in filmmaking and putting artists in the driver's seat of technological innovation.

“Filmmaking has always been driven by technology. After the Lumiere Brothers and Edison's ground-breaking invention, filmmakers unleashed the hidden storytelling power of cameras. Later technological breakthroughs — sound, color, VFX — allowed us to tell stories in ways that couldn't be told before. Today is no different. Now is the moment to explore these new tools and shape them for the future of storytelling,” Aronofsky said in an official statement.

The news was announced alongside Google's I/O event, in which the tech giant also unveiled its latest generative video model called Veo 3, as well as an advanced new gen-AI editing tool called Flow. Google DeepMind will provide Primordial Soup's team early access to these tools. 

The first film produced under the partnership is called “Ancestra” and is directed by Eliza McNitt. Her film will premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on June 13, and it will be followed by a panel featuring the filmmakers and moderated by Aronofsky. The film blends live-action filmmaking and performance with generative visuals and is described as a deeply personal narrative inspired by the day McNitt was born. McNitt trained the AI models on her own baby pictures and other photos taken by her late father in order to generate a newborn infant with a story that could be shaped by her own biography.

“With ‘Ancestra,' I was able to visualize the unseen, transforming family archives, emotions, and science into a cinematic experience that feels both intimate and expansive,” said McNitt.

McNitt is known for a previous VR experience that was executive produced by Aronofsky that featured the voices of Millie Bobby Brown, Jessica Chastain, and Patti Smith as the voices of the cosmos. It was the first VR project to ever be acquired out of Sundance.

 










Two additional films, yet to be announced, will explore other new applications of Veo, Google DeepMind's video generation model. 

Watch the first teaser for “Ancestra” above, and learn more about this strategic partnership at the Google DeepMind blog.

Generative AI filmmaker Dave Clark has tried “every tool under the sun” for making his artificially intelligent movies, most famously for his viral short “Battalion.” But even in the year since he released that video, the technology around Gen-AI has advanced considerably, and he believes that what was considered innovative back then can now be pushed even further.

On Tuesday, Google at its I/O event unveiled Flow, a generative-AI video generation tool powered by Google's latest AI model, Veo 3. Clark was one of the AI filmmakers who collaborated with Google Labs on the functionality and interface of the new tool such that it was designed with filmmakers and creators in mind. Suffice it to say, he's impressed by the results.

“My mind is still blown by the level of control,” Clark told IndieWire ahead of the launch of Flow. “This is for me as a filmmaker, this is what I've been waiting for. You've put in the 10,000 hours, you struggle through these prompts, and you use these different systems. But all we really hope for is that level of control that I feel like we finally got some sense of it, and it's a long time coming for being so early in it.”

Flow has camera controls that allow filmmakers to specifically articulate the movement and visual angle they want to create for a shot as though they're directing a cinematographer. It has a feature called Scenebuilder that allows filmmakers to generate a scene, and then extend it while keeping all of their character designs and locations consistent and intact. Creators can upload and combine multiple reference images that will match things like faces, clothing, and locations, doing so with hyper-specific detail. 

Flow also allows for more natural language in prompt writing, such that it understands visual language of screenwriting and granular technical details like lens choices, lighting conditions, focal lengths, or film grain. It's even capable of generating sound in real time with the video generation, including sound effects, background music, and dialogue.

Clark and his AI production banner Promise are using Flow to create a new AI-generated short called “Freelancers” about two adopted brothers who each, through separate paths, become international spies and hitmen. He described one scene he generated in which his two protagonists are sitting in a diner, complete with an establishing shot with a slow dolly in. He then prompted the model to use a dynamic, handheld camera motion, followed by a tracking shot of the two characters running.

 










“And it did it! To see the way that the camera was shaking, it's this exact same way I would probably film it if I was in that restaurant. It was pretty cool, and I haven't seen that level of [control],” Clark said. 

It wasn't that long ago that OpenAI unveiled its Sora video model; AI filmmakers we spoke to then were stunned that it had “prompt adherence,” where you can articulate one thing to happen and then have something else happen to that figure within the same sequence. Flow and Veo 3 demonstrated an even more advanced capability, in which a scene creators have generated can then be dragged and extended on a timeline to effectively continue the action and even lengthen the duration of an individual shot beyond the 6 – 8 seconds the model would normally generate. 

Clark likened it to virtually being able to create his own “1917” style “oner” should he want to, with the action extending from location to location even as the character remains the same.

“Let's say it's a guy driving a car around the Amalfi Coast. With Scenebuilder inside Flow, the director in me was able to block out the rest of the scene,” Clark explained. “So maybe it starts off inside the car with the guy driving, then it's POV, then I could switch to a wide shot, and the way Flow works is it actually knows all of the information that was put in, all the prompts, the way the character looks, the way the Amalfi Coast and the road looks, the color of the car. It's able to translate that information into the next cut or scene or edit, if you will, and continue on that narrative.” 

 










Clark said he got as specific as articulating the scene to look as though it was shot with a 50mm lens all the way up to a 135mm long lens, and Flow not only understands, but can then marry that work with specific blocking.

Matthieu Kim Lorrain, Creative Lead at Google DeepMind, and Thomas Iljic, Product Lead at Google Labs, spoke with IndieWire about understanding someone like Clark's creative process in order to inform how Flow should operate, and they were stunned by what he and others were able to create with what they thought was, at the time, bare-bones functionality.

“Show and tell is important. They don't want just to type text,” Iljic said. “They want to bring in these elements, these ingredients. They want consistency across shots. They want to have projects to start managing the structure, because it's so many files, wondering how am I going to put this thing together?”

Lorrain added that the key word for AI filmmakers is “customization,” and five different AI filmmakers might have five different workflows, or even one filmmaker might have a different method for a different project, and that's all built into Flow.

“Sometimes you need image to video because actually you want to start from a composition. You want to really curate the perfect image and then expand,” Lorrain said. “Sometimes it's world-building. And in the case of world-building, that's why we have the ingredients so you can define your characters, find your environment, and they want that. That's the type of control. It's not just control on how they can control the video, but also control on how they can design the creative process for each project.”

 










Clark's Promise earlier today announced additional funding from Google's AI Future Fund, as well as Crossbeam Venture Partners, Kivu Ventures, and Saga Ventures. But Google is also partnering with two other filmmakers on the launch of Flow, including Henry Daubrez and Junie Lau. Flow is also available now to subscribers of Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra plans in the U.S., with more countries coming soon.

Clark isn't sure what the specific next frontier is with the rapidly evolving technology, but he does believe that as the tools become more accessible, it's incumbent on creators to at least understand it.

“I always reference the James Camerons and the George Lucases, some of the top filmmakers were always technologists, and I feel like we're going to see that next level, that next school of George Lucas, that are going to be inherently technologists,” Clark said. “You're going to have to understand technology, whether or not you use it.”

	Early Monday morning, when much of the White House press corps was fast asleep, President Donald Trump demanded the federal government conduct a “major investigation” into singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen, a Trump critic, and his presidential endorsement last year.


	On Friday, the sitting American president had already warned Springsteen that he “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT,” and “we'll all see how it goes for him” once the rock star is back home in the United States. Springsteen failed to comply, and spoke out once again about the “unfit” president at a concert in Manchester, England, on Saturday. “Things are happening right now that are altering the very nature of our country's democracy, and they're too important to ignore,” he said.


	Those comments led to a new wave of baseless threats from Trump against Springsteen and two more prominent celebrities who endorsed Kamala Harris in 2024, Beyoncé and Oprah Winfrey.


	There are numerous scandals, authoritarian power grabs, and moral abominations being carried out by the second Trump administration, largely in plain sight. The twice-impeached, repeatedly indicted president thrives on attention, so it may feel easy to dismiss Trump's latest celeb-obsessed outburst as a mere temper tantrum or even a distraction.

	











	That would be a mistake. Trump's crusade against the First Amendment and free expression dates back to at least his first four years in the White House, and his 2016 presidential campaign. And Trump's recurring threat against “The Boss” is yet another front in his second administration's larger scorched-earth campaign against free speech and democratic values in this country. 


	“Accountability for a class of people who act as if they're above the law may be uncomfortable for Rolling Stone, but it's refreshing to the American people,” says Trump White House spokesperson Harrison Fields. He adds that the Department of Justice and the Federal Election Commission have jurisdiction over these supposed matters, and that “each entity will act independently in its decision-making.” (The FEC declined to comment on this story; the DOJ did not immediately respond.)

	According to three sources familiar with the matter, Trump has repeatedly vented to close associates, both before and after his 2024 election victory, about using the Justice Department, Federal Communications Commission, FEC, and other government organs to crack down on (in his incorrect characterization) the “illegal” campaign finance violations made by Democratic-aligned celebrities, including late-night talk show hosts, and other liberals.

	











	“HOW MUCH DID KAMALA HARRIS PAY BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FOR HIS POOR PERFORMANCE DURING HER CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT? WHY DID HE ACCEPT THAT MONEY IF HE IS SUCH A FAN OF HERS? ISN'T THAT A MAJOR AND ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION? WHAT ABOUT BEYONCÉ? …AND HOW MUCH WENT TO OPRAH, AND BONO??? I am going to call for a major investigation into this matter,” the president posted to his social media website on Monday. “Candidates aren't allowed to pay for ENDORSEMENTS, which is what Kamala did, under the guise of paying for entertainment … IT'S NOT LEGAL! For these unpatriotic ‘entertainers,' this was just a CORRUPT & UNLAWFUL way to capitalize on a broken system. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!”


	Trump's legal theory here is wrong — he effectively has the situation backwards.  


	Harris did not pay Beyoncé, Winfrey, or Springsteen for their endorsements. The candidate, in reality, made payments to their production companies for services rendered, as is legally required. 


	Harris' campaign reported paying $1 million to Winfrey's production company, Harpo Productions, to stage and staff their livestreamed town hall in Detroit. The Harris campaign paid $165,000 in November to Beyoncé's production company, Parkwood Production Media, after she appeared at a Harris rally in Houston. The campaign paid $76,000 to Springsteen's production company, Thrill Hill Productions, after he performed at a Harris rally in Georgia in October.  


	Campaign finance laws require campaigns to pay fair-market value to vendors. If she failed to pay any of these companies for performing services at an event or rally, it would constitute an illegal in-kind contribution to the campaign in two ways: The contribution would exceed donation limits, and companies are not permitted to donate directly to candidates. 


	And yet, there are right-wing attorneys and political advisers who've entertained, or egged on, these impulses of Trump's in recent months. Some of these lawyers and operatives, the sources add, now work in Trump's government.  


	The president also apparently believes that a late-night comedian telling a mean joke about him might constitute an illegal in-kind political contribution to his opponents. 


	During his first administration, he tried to get his Department of Justice to punish Saturday Night Live and other TV shows, and he separately instructed his White House staff to pressure Disney to censor ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. 

	











	When Trump would do those things during his first term in office, some of his key officials would roll their eyes and laugh it off, then wait for him to move on or forget about it. Today, President Trump is surrounded by senior personnel whose primary job qualification is that they will dutifully explore and execute on his most fascistic, corrupt, and nonsensical demands. 


	One reason that Trump continues to be fixated on weaponizing campaign finance laws against his political and cultural enemies, such as the “Thunder Road” songwriter, is rather simple: revenge. 


	According to those who've spoken to Trump in recent months about this, the president still hasn't gotten over the fact that he was implicated — first by federal prosecutors in 2018, then by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in 2023 — as the ringleader in a conspiracy to break campaign finance laws and deliver hush-money payments to women, including most famously adult film star Stormy Daniels. Bragg indicted Trump, and the trial last year resulted in him becoming the first convicted-felon American president. 


	Within the past several months, the president has privately grumbled that if prosecutors could use the (as he's at times called it) “bullshit” campaign-finance-related claim against him, there is no reason it shouldn't be applied to certain famous entertainers, TV and news personalities, Democratic figures, and other targets, two sources who've spoken to Trump about this matter say.


	“Democrats pretended to care about campaign finance violations when they persecuted President Trump with their lawfare,” Mike Davis, a conservative lawyer close to Trump who is a key player of the MAGA legal elite, tells Rolling Stone. “Maybe they shouldn't have thrown stones in glass houses. Nobody is above the law.”


	It would be much easier to shrug off Trump's menacing of Springsteen if only Trump's new administration hadn't already demonstrated a gleeful willingness to throw people in jail only because they voiced an opinion or wrote an op-ed. And it was just last month that this president gathered the media and TV cameras so they could watch him sign an executive order in the Oval Office ordering the Justice Department to criminally investigate Chris Krebs, a former Trump cybersecurity official whose only sin was he publicly stated the truth that the 2020 election was not in fact rigged against Trump.


	As Team Trump knows full well, it is almost beside the point whether or not the Trump administration ever launches a formal investigation of Springsteen or his absolutely legal endorsement of then-Vice President Harris. The threat of smashing the full weight of the federal government on The Boss, because he exercised his right to free speech, is a repressive action in itself — one that would not be disregarded or excused were it done by virtually any other U.S. leader in recent history.

	











	In a sense, this is all expected, even if it is all objectively scandalous and abusive. During his 2024 reelection bid, Trump vowed to the voters that he would exact “retribution” from the Oval Office, and that his enemies, real and imagined, would suffer, either because they tried to hold him accountable for his various alleged crimes or because they pissed him off.


	At times, Trump tried to vaguely downplay his explicit promises, and defaulted to a talking point that policy and economic “success” would be his retribution. His attempt at campaign-trail public relations may have given some of his associates false hope.


	In early January, prior to Trump's second inauguration in Washington, D.C., celebrity lawyer Alan Dershowitz spoke at a screening, hosted at Trump's private Florida club and estate of Mar-a-Lago, of a documentary about John Eastman, an attorney who aided Trump's efforts to cling to power and overturn the 2020 election results. (Dershowitz is featured in the film.)


	Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat who was part of Trump's defense team during his first impeachment, tells Rolling Stone that as he delivered his remarks at the event, he noticed the then-president-elect sitting in the audience. At that moment, he decided to address Trump directly, to issue a modest plea of sorts.


	“I said I was opposed to any kind of weaponization of the legal system… and I was hoping the new administration would end any kind of lawfare,” Dershowitz recalls. “The proper response to what happened to you, I said, was not to do it to Democrats, it is to not do it to anybody … Both parties should eschew weaponization.”

Follow all our Sean Combs trial coverage


	Regina Ventura, mother of Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, said that while Sean Combs was fuming over Cassie's relationship with Kid Cudi, the mogul demanded Regina pay him $20,000 to “recoup money” he'd spent on Cassie's career. 


	While testifying at Combs' sex-trafficking trial Tuesday, Regina was asked to recall a letter Cassie sent her in December 2011 (which Cassie also discussed during her own testimony last week). In the letter, Cassie told her mother that Combs was threatening to release videos from their freak-offs after learning about her relationship with Cudi (real name Scott Mescudi). Cassie also told her mother that Combs was threatening to have someone “hurt” her and Mescudi, with Combs allegedly saying he would be out of the country when it happened. 


	Recalling how she felt reading the letter, Regina said: “I was physically sick. I did not understand it, the sex tape threw me. He was trying to hurt my daughter.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Around the same time, Regina testified, Combs contacted her and asked for the $20,000. Regina said that she and her husband took out a home equity loan to pay the mogul. 

	











	“That's the only way we could get the money,” Regina said, adding that she went through with the request because she was “scared about my daughter's safety” and because Combs “demanded it.”


	Regina said that she wired the money to a Bad Boy account, per instructions from Combs' bookkeeper. And about five days later, she said, the money was returned to her account. She did not have any further communication with Combs about the money. 


	Regina spent no more than 40 minutes testifying Tuesday, with Combs' defense notably declining to cross-examine her. After the prosecution finished their line of questioning, Combs' defense attorney Marc Agnifilo greeted Regina before saying, “I don't have any questions for you.” (This is the first witness in the case so far that the defense has not cross-examined.)


	While Combs has often been active and engaged during the trial — exchanging confidences with his attorneys and turning to look at witnesses as they enter the courtroom — he avoided looking at Regina when she passed by him on the way to the stand. And as Regina left the courtroom, she tried to make eye contact with Combs, who continued to ignore her.

	Elsewhere during her testimony, Regina spoke about photos she took of her daughter in December 2011 after Combs had allegedly assaulted her. This was the first time, Regina said, that Cassie had told her about Combs being physically violent with her. Regina recalled of the photos: “She was bruised, and I wanted to make sure that we memorialized it.”

	











	Near the end of her brief time on the stand, Regina also testified about a “bitter argument” she had with Combs in August 2016, while visiting her daughter in Los Angeles for her 30th birthday. The argument, Regina said, erupted outside of Cassie's apartment after Combs allegedly “stole” Cassie's phone. 


	“We were arguing about the phone, I wanted the phone back and he was holding it,” Regina said. Noting that one of Combs' bodyguards was standing between them, Regina said, “I was yelling, screaming, and trying to hit him but I wasn't successful.” 


	Eventually, Regina said, Combs relinquished the phone, but then left in Cassie's car. 


	While on the stand last week, Cassie testified that, along with threatening to release the explicit videos of her and “hurt” her and Mescudi, Combs allegedly discussed blowing up Mescudi's car, and wanting Mescudi's friends to see the explosion. In 2012, a Porsche owned by Mescudi was set on fire by an “incendiary device,” as a contemporaneous police report put it. And Mescudi himself previously shared a statement with The New York Times confirming that his car had exploded.

	Tuesday began with the continued testimony from David James, one of Combs' former assistants. While on the stand, James said Combs hired a former FBI agent to give lie-detector tests to his staff after some of his money and possessions went missing. He also spoke at length about an incident in which Combs allegedly took three handguns to confront his rival Suge Knight (an incident that Cassie Ventura detailed during her own testimony). 


	“I was really shook by it,” James said. “This was the first time as his assistant that I realized my life was in danger.”


	While being cross-examined, Combs' defense attorney Marc Agnifilo asked James if he had objected to driving Combs while he had the three hand guns on him, to which James replied, “Respectfully, sir, you have someone with three guns that close proximity, I didn't think I had the option to say something.”


	Combs' defense had tried earlier to bar James' testimony on grounds that it was not relevant, but the judge ultimately sided with the prosecution, who said it supported their racketeering charge. To that end, Agnifilo pressed James about a meeting he'd had with the government, where he was instructed not to provide more details on the Knight incident. James said he obliged because he was told “not to say anything that would incriminate himself.” 


	Agnifilo later asked James if he was granted immunity for his testimony. James said he was not sure of the specifics, but said he believed his attorneys arranged a proffer agreement, which would provide him some protection from prosecution. (There has so far been no evidence, however, that a crime was committed during the trip to the restaurant.)

	











	Later in the day, the court heard testimony from Sharay Hayes, a male escort known as “The Punisher,” who was hired by Combs and Ventura on numerous occasions for freak-offs. Hayes offered more insight into how these highly choreographed sexual encounters were carried out, recalling how Combs would give Ventura “subtle directions” regarding everything from the lighting to the positioning of her body.

	While being questioned by the prosecution, Hayes said he understood these encounters as Ventura “creating a sexy scene that was enjoyable to her partner.” While Ventura never refused Combs' directions, Hayes said that he “did observe sometimes a sigh, a wince, that seemed to be frustration at the frequency” of Combs' directions.


	During cross-examination, Combs' defense lawyer, Xavier Donaldson, asked Hayes if Ventura ever appeared uncomfortable during the freak-offs. “I did not get any cues that there was a discomfort with what was going on,” Hayes replied. Later, he said, everything seemed consensual, and when Donaldson asked him if his reading of the situation, and Ventura's comfort level, was based on “25 years experience doing dry humping on hundreds of thousands of women,” Hayes replied, “Correct.”

	The pressure is on for Carmy, Sydney, and the workers of The Bear. On Tuesday, FX released the official trailer for the Emmy-winning dramedy‘s fourth season, which will premiere on June 25.


	The teaser sees Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) and Sydney (Ayo Edebiri) put to the test as a countdown clock ticks toward the restaurant's potential bankruptcy and shutdown, especially after numerous negative reviews criticizing inconsistency within the restaurant. “I'm fired up and ready to go,” says Sydney. “I get it: Chaos and turmoil… But it's a problem when you're letting it fuel you and fuel the food.”


	“I don't want this place to be chaos,” Carmy later tells Sydney. “You know that, right?”


	The video teases several subplots: Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) struggles with the emotional effects of his divorce, Sydney considers whether to work at another restaurant, and the restaurant's workers bond as they struggle to keep the restaurant alive. The show picks up where Season Three left off: Carmy opens The Bear, a fine-dining joint, but faces speed bumps along the way.

	“There's one really true thing about restaurants,” says Carmy. “You are never alone.”


The Bear has become an awards-season favorite, winning 21 awards for its first three seasons. Christopher Storer created the show and executive-produced it with Joanna Calo, Josh Senior, Hiro Murai, Nate Matteson, and Matty Matheson, who also stars in it.

	An FX logline for the show says the new season will see the staff “determined not only to survive, but also to take The Bear to the next level.” All ten episodes of The Bear will release on Hulu June 25. 


	“With new challenges around every corner, the team must adapt, adjust and overcome,” reads the logline. “This season, the pursuit of excellence isn't just about getting better – it's about deciding what's worth holding on to.”

It was moving to watch Denzel Washington lope up to the Lumière stage at Cannes and tear up as he accepted his Honorary Palme d'Or from Cannes veteran Spike Lee Monday night at the “Highest 2 Lowest” premiere. It was a surprise to the actor, as he watched a clip reel that ranged from his four prior roles with Lee (“Mo' Better Blues,” “He Got Game,” “Malcolm X,” and “Inside Man”) to “Philadelphia,” “Flight,” “The Book of Eli,” “The Hurricane,” “The Tragedy of Macbeth,” “Fences,” and more.

Festival director Thierry Frémaux knows how to make the most of a Hollywood movie star, who flew into France and out again on his one day off from doing eight sold-out shows a week as Shakespeare's “Othello” on Broadway. If the man looked weary, it's understandable. At 70, he's at the peak of his powers, and if the Oscar gods are smiling, he'll land his third Oscar (after “Training Day” and “Glory”) for his bravura performance as a record mogul struggling with legacy, morality, and family in “Highest 2 Lowest” (A24/Apple TV+), Lee's assured reimagining of Akira Kurosawa's 1963 classic “High and Low.”

Lee is in top form directing one of the most entertaining movies at Cannes; the director makes the most of the glossy New York settings and a heart-stopping subway ride to the Bronx, cut against an Eddie Palmieri concert at Yankee Stadium. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique and editor Barry Alexander Brown could be in the Oscar race along with Washington, Lee, and supporting actor Jeffrey Wright; the movie opens wide August 22 and plays for two weeks before hitting Apple TV+. Rapper A$AP Rocky, onscreen elsewhere in A24's “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You” this year, also gets a great scene in the last third of the film as a musician in fraught pursuit of Washington's character.

The 2025 Cannes Film Festival has so far brought a panoply of movies for critics, audiences, and potential buyers to check out. Lately, Cannes has launched a number of Oscar contenders, especially from Neon, after a series of Palme d'Or winners: “Parasite,” “Titane,” “Triangle of Sadness,” “Anatomy of a Fall,” and “Anora.” That film became the second Neon title to win both the Palme and the Best Picture Oscar after “Parasite.” But last year also launched Oscar-winners “Flow” and Netflix's “Emilia Pérez” out of Cannes.

 










Which movies at Cannes 2025 will wind up in Oscar contention? Neon CEO Tom Quinn, who joined IndieWire's “Screen Talk” podcast live at the American Pavilion on Tuesday (more to come on that), said that the nine-member Cannes jury is a useful sample of some 9,000 Oscar voters, including international actors and directors. Their taste, along with the critics in the constantly updating Screen International jury grid, play a role in distributors' plans. That's why winning Cannes prizes means a lot for a future Oscar campaign.

The highest-profile Oscar contenders at this date also include Lynne Ramsay's “Die My Love,” which MUBI acquired for $23 million. Neon was in the bidding at a reasonable price, said Quinn, who described MUBI's buy as a “press release.” The likeliest Oscar contender is Jennifer Lawrence, who plays a young mother living in an isolated country house with her partner (Robert Pattinson), who falls into a deep post-partum depression and goes quite mad. It will be catnip for the Oscar actors branch. 

Another magnetic turn comes from nonagenarian June Squibb (who was Best Supporting Actress-nominated for Cannes entry “Nebraska” in 2014) in “Eleanor the Great” (Sony Pictures Classics), which was directed by rookie Scarlett Johansson.

 










Of course, a lot depends on what happens at the Cannes awards this coming weekend, as well as which distributor comes through for the likes of actor-turned-director Harris Dickinson's “Urchin,” which boasts a breakout performance from Frank Dillane as an unhoused Londoner.

A number of foreign-language films will wind up submitted by their country of origin, and Cannes awards will help tip the balance toward, say, Germany's critics' favorite “Sound of Falling” from Mascha Schilinski vs. out-of-competition period World War II drama “Amrum,” from director Fatih Akin.

As festival attendees debate the merits of polarizing films such as Julia Ducournau's sci-fi drug drama “Alpha” (Neon), Wes Anderson's too-familiar “The Phoenician Scheme” (Focus), and Ari Aster's modern western “Eddington” (A24), the likelihood of their winding up in the Oscar race seem slim.

There are still many more films to come, as we're only on Day 7 of the festival, so stay tuned for more highlights.

The actress joins the Lionsgate movie adaptation as the Panem stylist who was first portrayed in the franchise by Elizabeth Banks.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Elle Fanning is set to join the fray in The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping.


	The Emmy-nominated actress has been cast as Effie Trinket in the forthcoming Lionsgate film, The Hollywood Reporter has learned exclusively. Francis Lawrence directs the movie adaptation of Suzanne Collins‘ best-selling novel that will hit theaters Nov. 20, 2026.




	In the feature, Effie serves as the stylist for Haymitch Abernathy (played by Joseph Zada) in the preparation for the 50th Hunger Games. Elizabeth Banks portrayed an older version of Effie in the series' first four films that kicked off with The Hunger Games hitting theaters in 2012.

Previously announced castmembers include Zada, Whitney Peak, Mckenna Grace, Jesse Plemons, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Maya Hawke, Lili Taylor and Ben Wang. THR's exclusive reporting has included the recent news that Ralph Fiennes has been cast as the diabolical President Snow and that Molly McCann and Iona Bell will portray standout book characters Louella and Lou Lou, respectively.

	“From the moment Suzanne released the book, one question echoed from fans around the world: Who will play Effie?” says Lionsgate Motion Picture Group co-president Erin Westerman. “Elizabeth Banks made her iconic — so who could honor that legacy while bringing us back to Effie's early, most formative days? For us, there was only one answer. Elle Fanning's career has been transcendent. She has a rare presence — warm, sparkling and layered with extraordinary depth. She was the undeniable fan favorite from the start, and we're honored she answered the call. The odds, it turns out, were in our favor.”


	Lawrence helms the movie from a script by Billy Ray that adapts Collins' book. Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson produce for Color Force, while Cameron MacConomy executive produces.


	Meredith Wieck and Scott O'Brien oversee Sunrise on the Reaping for Lionsgate. Robert Melnik handled the deal on behalf of the studio. 


	The book Sunrise on the Reaping takes place in Panem on the morning of the reaping for the 50th Hunger Games, 24 years before the events in The Hunger Games, the first novel that published in 2008. The franchise's first five movies have surpassed $3.3 billion at the worldwide box office, with the initial four films led by Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen.

	











	Fanning's recent credits include last year's Oscar-nominated feature A Complete Unknown and Joachim Trier's Sentimental Value, premiering at Cannes this week. She can be seen in such forthcoming projects as the Apple TV+ series Margo's Got Money Troubles and 20th Century's fall movie Predator: Badlands. 


	The actress is represented by UTA, TFC Management and Hansen Jacobson.

Zach Galifianakis, Hannah Waddingham and Billy Magnussen are among the stars of this new take on the 2002 animated film. 


							By 

	Frank Scheck



	Disney's insatiable quest to mine its own IP continues with this live-action remake of an animated film that premiered a mere 23 years ago. But hey, that's enough time for a new generation of potential fans to be born while tapping into the nostalgia of those who grew up watching not only the original movie but also its three direct-to-video sequels and three television series.


	Creatively, there's no real reason for this version of Lilo & Stitch to exist, especially since the film's version of Stitch is necessarily animated as well. But commercially, that's a whole different matter, assuming Trump's tariffs don't prevent toy stores from being fully stocked with the plush toy version that will be on many children's wish list for Santa.

The Bottom Line

	
	Déjà vu, live-action style.
	



Release date: Friday, May 23Cast: Sydney Elizabeth Agudong, Billy Magnussen, Tia Carrere, Hannah Waddingham, Chris Sanders, Courtney B. Vance, Zach Galifianakis, Maia KealohaDirector: Dean Fleischer CampScreenwriters: Chris Kekaniokalani Bright, Mike Van Waes

									Rated PG,
								108 minutes			






	Directed by Dean Fleischer Camp, following in the tradition of acclaimed indie filmmakers (Marcel the Shell With Shoes On) graduating to the big-budget leagues (this film cost a reported $100 million), the live-action Lilo & Stitch is faithful enough to the original to please traditionalists and tweaked enough to feel somewhat fresh. The most notable change is the emotional deepening of the relationship between the 6-year-old Hawaiian orphan Lilo (Maia Kealoha, bringing real heart and sparkling personality to the role) and her older sister, Nani (Sydney Elizabeth Agudong), who's struggling to maintain her guardianship amid financial difficulties and Lilo's rebellious behavior.


	The story begins with a sequence set on a planet ruled by the United Galactic Federation and its leader, the Grand Councilwoman (Hannah Waddingham, just as imposing in animated form as in real life), featuring the sort of ugly CGI animation that makes you long for the human actors to appear. That's where we're introduced to Stitch (voiced by Chris Sanders, reprising his role from the original), a destruction-loving, genetically engineered creature created by mad scientist Dr. Jumba Jookiba (Zach Galifianakis). 


	Threatened with exile, Stitch manages to escape and winds up on Earth — Hawaii, to be specific — where he's pursued by Jumba and Agent Pleakley (Billy Magnussen), who's assigned to chaperone him. Shortly after arriving, the duo manage to assume human form, providing the opportunity for the two actors to showcase their considerable physical comedy skills as their characters awkwardly adapt to their new bodies.

	











	Meanwhile, the koala-like, very blue Stitch winds up in an animal shelter, where he's surprisingly mistaken for a dog (one of the film's running gags) and gets adopted by Lilo. The little girl and the adorable but rambunctious creature get off to a rough start, not helped by the latter's propensity for wreaking havoc wherever he goes. But their bond continues to deepen as she teaches him that, wait for it, “Ohana means family.”


	Along the way, there are enough madcap events, fast-paced chases and dangerous situations to pad the film's running time to 108 minutes compared to the original's peppy 85. For adults, a little of the visual chaos will go a long way, with Stitch, cute as he is, not exactly E.T. in terms of appeal.


	But younger viewers should eat it all up, and those weaned on the original film will appreciate the numerous shout-outs, including supporting turns by Tia Carrere, who voiced Nani in the original, and Jason Scott Lee, who voiced Nani's surfer friend David (here played by Kaipo Dudoit). There are several new characters as well, such as David's feisty grandmother (an amusing Amy Hill, another veteran of the franchise) and Cobra Bubbles (Courtney B. Vance), a federal agent attempting to track down Stitch. (And yes, the character's name is a callback to the social worker in the original.)


	In both incarnations, Lilo & Stitch is not in the first rank of Disney family films, as evidenced by the fact that this remake was originally slated to go direct-to-streaming. But that should hardly matter, with this version likely to clean up at the box office at the start of the busy summer season.

It's possible that, more than twenty years since its initial release, many movie-goers have forgotten just how high the stakes are in Chris Sanders and Dean DeBois' animated charmer “Lilo & Stitch.” You'd be forgiven for not entirely remembering that the comedy, which follows the antics of its eponymous BFFs (Lilo, a rambunctious five-year-old with a real flair for getting into trouble and Stitch, a rambunctious bright blue alien with a real flair for getting into trouble), is also about a family devastated by personal tragedy, desperately trying to hold on to each other in the face of very tough odds.

 










When said rambunctious bright blue alien crash-lands into the lives of Lilo and her big sister Nani, he adds a touch of whimsy and some nutty adventures into their otherwise complicated lives. Bolstered by cute and cuddly creature design, catchy tunes, and frequent reminders about the importance of ohana (family), the 2002 Disney animated outing is an enduring gem that combines wacky fun with some necessary lessons. It works so well because of its wily combination of packaging and messaging.

But it also works significantly less well when that packaging changes, switched from bright and bubbly animation to a live-action setting that can't help but constantly remind viewers of the supposed reality of the situation. And while much of the charm of the original film remains, in Dean Fleischer Camp's updated “Lilo & Stitch,” it's significantly harder to fully divest ourselves of the pressure of some very earthbound concerns. In short, it's tough to let go and laugh at the antics of a destructive (but cute!) alien being when lingering worry over the need for health insurance hangs over every wacky and wild interaction like the Sword of Damocles. 

Perhaps these are the worries of someone who, too often, would wonder about the clean-up and renovation bills waiting for, say, the McAllister family after the events of “Home Alone.” But so much of what makes the animated “Lilo & Stitch” film stick — so much of what makes any of Disney's best-loved animated classics stick — is that telling of a serious, important story inside an entertaining, family-friendly box. And while animation is not only a medium for kids' movies (let's at least allow that to be laid to rest), it is very often the best medium for these sorts of stories because of the way it can appeal to a kids' eyes and hearts. That's a message that the live-action remake-mad Disney might want to remember.

 










Written by Chris Kekaniokalani Bright and Mike Van Waes, the live-action “Lilo & Stitch” lightly updates Sanders and DeBois' original story, including a few neat character evolutions (like casting original voice actor Amy Hill as Tūtū, a new version of her previous character Mrs. Hasagawa, or turning original Nani voice actor Tia Carrere into social worker Mrs. Kekoa) and the very smart choice to allow intergalactic baddies Dr. Jumba Jookiba (Zach Galifianakis) and Agent Pleakley (a perfectly cast Billy Magnussen) to play both their alien and human versions. But its heart remains the same, both a feature and a bug: this is a story about ohana, and about what it really takes to keep a family together. That's inherently dramatic stuff.

A snappy opening takes us through some essential introductions: Stitch (again voiced by original co-director Sanders) is the product of illegal genetic experimentations from the evil Dr. Jookiba who, it seems, was really into the idea of creating a being both silly and smart, adorable and ugly, and totally hellbent on destruction. As the Grand Councilwoman (voiced by Hannah Waddingham) bemoans during a very bad indeed meeting of the United Galactic Federation, Experiment 626 (as he's known before he hits Earth) is “so naughty.” His punishment for his creation? Exile away from the rest of the civilized federation. 

 










626, in all his infernal naughtiness, escapes the fed's clutches and zips his way straight to Earth, a protected land that's been designated as a space for revitalizing the mosquito population (one of many good jokes). Until this point, much of 2025's “Lilo & Stitch” looks a heck of a lot like the original, with colorful, animal-inspired aliens pottering around a massive ship (we especially love the trigger-happy pink-haired gal, so eager to blow Earth sky high for funsies). And then, we're on Earth, and suddenly reminded this is live-action and ostensibly, if not real, at least rooted in some kind of reality.

Despite living in the relative idyll of Hawaii, Lilo (spirited newbie Maia Kealoha) has lots of problems: her parents have passed away, her older sister Nani (a wonderful Sydney Elizebeth Agudong) is trying to raise Lilo, there's never enough money, there's never enough time, and Lilo is way too plucky and smart to appeal to most other kids her own age. More than anything, Lilo wants a best friend, and it's a credit to the film that her concerns are treated with just as much as gravity as Nani's, which are much more heavy and worrisome (after all, why do you think they need a social worker?). 

When 626 crash-lands on Earth, it's only a matter of time until the infinitely curious Lilo finds him (as in the animated film, their meet-cute takes place at an animal rescue; unlike in the animated film, it's significantly harder to buy that the cute and fluffy and also blue and bipedal alien is even remotely passable as a dog). Hot on his heels? The mismatched Dr. Jookiba (villainous) and Agent Pleakley (hilarious, obsessed with humans and their fashion in particular). Circling all of them? Courtney B. Vance as CIA operative (sort of) Cobra Bubbles. Ever-inescapable? The very real possibility Nani is going to have to give up Lilo. And no, the appearance of an insane alien with an appetite for destruction really does not help matters. 

 










How ever will they get out of these many pickles? Well, by way of some cute adventures, some incredibly upsetting upheavals, and a generous dash of alien-created technology, used frequently enough to really tickle some of those latent “Home Alone” memories. Along the way, everyone — one of the true misses of this version is a credits-set quick dash through the charming and totally unexpected family Lilo and Stitch manage to craft through thick and thin, more attention really should have been paid to this modern ohana — learns some valuable lessons, has some fun, and falls deeper in love with the newly-minted Stitch.

The heart of this story remains firmly intact, but there's something about seeing it rendered in live-action that takes away its inherent magic. It's harder to fall into, much tougher to lose yourself in. Maybe we can never quite recreate the dreaminess of an original story, but there's something to be said for remembering what it feels like to be caught inside that sort of bubble, and not crash-landed back on Earth.

Walt Disney Pictures will release “Lilo & Stitch” in theaters on Friday, May 23.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE:  SP Media Group, a production and entertainment company led by veteran producer and Special Advisor to Hollywood Ambassador Jon Voight, has acquired Avenue Six Studios, a production facility in Van Nuys, CA. Deadline first told you this was in the works earlier this month and part of SP Media's plans to boost local Hollywood shoots following their U.S. film and TV production incentive proposal to the President Donald Trump White House. 


	Founded by Paul Reitzen in 2009, the studio features four fully equipped sound stages, a backlot modeled after a New York City street, and has produced numerous films, commercials, and television shows, including talk shows for Oprah Winfrey and Marie Osmond.

	“We're committed to making films in Hollywood and making Avenue Six Studios the most producer-friendly studio for filmmakers from around the world,” Paul tells Deadline. “I currently have three productions slated for the studio this year and look forward to welcoming more projects to take advantage of its production capabilities.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Avenue Six is a versatile production studio perfectly suited to accommodate an array of creative visions,” said Scott Karol, President of SP Media Group/Atlas Comics. “The studios will be used primarily for film and television production, while its smaller sound stages will be used for branded content, music videos, photography, social media campaigns, podcasts, workshops, and industry events.”


	Future developments to the facility will include the integration of an LED virtual production stage to create immersive visual environments in real time, and a post-production facility, including editing suites and audio facilities, to offer a full-service, end-to-end production environment. This acquisition follows the successful relaunch of Atlas Comics, which under Paul's leadership is developing a slate of film and TV properties, led by the upcoming live-action feature Devilina in partnership with Paramount Pictures.


	“Avenue Six has always stood apart as a certified stage, saving clients time and money by eliminating permit requirements,” said Reitzin, founder of Avenue Six Studios. “With access to props, sets, lighting, equipment and our New York-style backlot, we've proudly served as a one-stop shop for nearly a decade.”

	











	Paul, together with Voight, recently submitted a plan to Trump on how to increase U.S.-based film and television production. The plan, currently under review at the White House, includes federal tax incentives, co-production treaties, job training, and infrastructure subsidies. Paul has recently collaborated with Voight on several movies, including Man with No Past, High Ground, and The Last Gunfight, and has several new titles now in development or production.


	Said Paul, “I've been filming in Los Angeles since I was 12 years old, when I first played a lead in Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s, Happy Birthday, Wanda June for Columbia Pictures, and I'm thrilled at what's possible now that we have our own studio.”


	Recently, Hollywood union leaders and reps of major studios team with Voight in a letter to Trump calling for expanded film and TV production incentives. Left unmentioned in the note was Trump's proposal for 100% tariffs on films produced in other countries.

	Since The Jungle Book in 1994, Disney has remade or provided live-action sequels for 27 of its original animated creations, with a reported 10 or so still in development. The practice hasn't always been easy to justify on artistic levels, with most recent “interpretations” since 2015's Cinderella failing to meet any kind of positive critical quorum. But the films keep coming, regardless, and sheer money may be the reason: Beauty & The Beast (2017), Aladdin (2019) and The Lion King (2019) all grossed over $1 billion, the latter of which is Disney's fifth highest-grossing film of all time.

	











	This has led to the fairly obvious conclusion that this substratum of Disney's movie-making is nothing more than brand promotion and capital gain. Many of these films, the recent Snow White most nefarious amongst them, are leaden with uncanny valley CGI, bizarre green screen devotion and a surprising lack of artistic intent.

	Enter Lilo & Stitch, in some ways an odd choice to join this cavalcade. Though the 2002 original animated film was popular, it hardly has the name recognition as its more fairytale-adjacent peers in the Disney catalog. But, despite a reportedly rocky development process (and legitimate concerns over the whitewashed casting of the role of Nani), Dean Fleischer Camp‘s take on the chaos agent alien and his impact on a small Hawaiian community is a mostly pleasant affair. The script, penned by Chris Kekaniokalani Bright and Mike Van Waes, cleverly keeps most of the bedrock of its predecessor while appropriately accommodating for 23 years of cultural changes and the shift from animation to live action. It's a sweet film, succeeding where other remakes have failed, namely in adhering closely to the core message of what inspired it without falling too deep down the rabbit hole of computer-generated slop.


	The story here remains largely unchanged from Chis Sanders' original script. Experiment 626 (Sanders) is an adorable but vicious creation designed for planetary destruction by the evil, egotistical scientist Dr. Jumba Jookiba (Zach Galifianakis). After the Grand Councilwoman (Hannah Waddingham) sentences the “disgusting” creature to a lifetime of confinement, he quickly escapes and crash-lands on Kaua'i in a quiet part of town. The Grand Councilwoman sends Jumba, along with Earth specialist Pleakley (Billy Magnussen), to retrieve 626 in exchange for the former's freedom. But the creature is quickly adopted by Lilo (Maia Kealoha), a precocious child with a special love for animals, at a kennel where he has been mistaken for an ugly dog. Much to Lilo's older sister Nani's (Sydney Agudong) objections, the “dog” comes home. Lilo renames him Stitch.

	











	Since their parents' deaths, Nani has been Lilo's legal guardian, but her ability to care for her younger sibling is questionable, and the pressure to provide a more stable home environment grows with each visit from social worker Mrs. Kekoa (Tia Carrere, who voiced Nani in the original). Meanwhile, a dogged undercover CIA agent, Cobra Bubbles (Courtney B. Vance in a role that has been retooled from the one Ving Rhames once voiced) pursues the truth behind Stitch's origins. Fleischer and company have added a hat on a hat for Nani who is not only staring down the barrel of constant financial insecurity but also buried dreams; she has apparently deferred acceptance to UCSD's prestigious marine biology program in order to stay home with Lilo. As Lilo and Stitch grow closer, Nani's desperation to keep her sister close grows more frantic, all the while Pleakley and Jumba repeatedly fall over each other to try and catch their prey.


	There's a lot going on. The chaos of these moving pieces is partly what made the original so successful, a carnival of hilarious and poignant ping-ponging elements. But here, the scales are too often tipped into the realm of the treacly, and the entire affair feels a bit sluggish. Stitch's unquenchable taste for madness was mirrored by the fervor of the animation; here the film stops its own momentum too often to check in again on the real-world implications of everything that's at stake. Repeated references to Nani's quieted aspirations effectively make her more the protagonist than Lilo, which means the film can sometimes feel like a story about a promising young woman being dragged down by her unruly sibling. The interplay between Pleakley and Jumba is more miss than hit, with Galifianakis seeming a bit uncomfortable in a role that is more straight than his buffoonish calling card. To put it simply, the film is just not very funny, and overall has the telegenic weight and texture of the direct-to-TV originals they used to churn out more regularly.


	But the film does succeed as an effectively warm ode to a family dynamic not frequently represented in popular media. Camp, whose previous work as the co-creator and steward of the Marcel the Shell character with ex-wife Jenny Slate, is an inspired choice, as his ability to hoover out the most pathos possible from the smallest creature available may now be something of a signature. E.T.-like, Lilo & Stitch demonstrates how the vacancy left by destruction can, optimistically, be filled with love and devotion, and that family can look like anything so long as it isn't conditionally based. And maybe that a little chaos every now and again is a good thing.

	Confirming what's been rumored for weeks, Elle Fanning is now set for the role of Effie Trinket, stylist for Haymitch Abernathy in the lead-up to the 50th Hunger Games, in Lionsgate's The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping, an adaptation of the bestseller by Suzanne Collins.


	Fanning's role was played by Elizabeth Banks in earlier installments. Joseph Zada plays Abernathy in Sunrise, with Whitney Peak as his girlfriend, Lenore Dove Baird. Others in the cast include Mckenna Grace as Maysilee Donner, Jesse Plemons as Plutarch Heavensbee, Kelvin Harrison Jr. as Beetee, Maya Hawke as Wiress, Lili Taylor as Mags, Ben Wang as Wyatt Callow, and Ralph Fiennes as President Snow.

	











	Published March 18, the latest installment in Collins' dystopian YA book series revisits the world of Panem 24 years before the events of The Hunger Games, starting on the morning of the reaping of the 50th Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell. The story centers on 16-year-old Haymitch, a clever and resourceful boy from District 12, who's unexpectedly chosen for this edition of the games, which will feature a deadly twist: twice the number of tributes, with 48 children sent into the arena to battle for their lives.

The first time that dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi was imprisoned for his supposed crimes against the regime, he spent most of his time in solitary confinement, blindfolded whenever he was taken out to be interrogated. Deprived of the use of his eyes, Panahi focused all of his attention on his ears — he would obsessively listen for auditory clues around him, and fantasize about his captor's identity based on the sound of his voice.

When Panahi was imprisoned again 12 years later, he was placed in the general population with 300 other prisoners, most of whom had opposed the government in one way or another, but few of whom agreed on the best tactic of doing so. The filmmaker was unnerved — and compelled — by the inevitability of those disagreements becoming even sharper between these people after they were released; some traumatized former detainees would simply try to get on with their lives, while others would be consumed with a rage that bent them toward revenge.

In his first project since the regime ostensibly lifted their restrictions on his art, Panahi draws from those very different prison experiences for a raw and blistering moral thriller about a hard-working Azeri man whose most tormented memories come rushing to the surface when he hears someone walk into his place of business with the same haunting squeak of his former torturer's prosthetic right leg. Played by Vahid Mobasser, a TV station programmer and part-time cab driver, Vahid impulsively abducts the man (Ebrahim Azizi, the only professional actor in this extraordinary cast), drags him into the middle of the desert, and digs a hole big enough to bury his pain alive. 

But — as he begins to suffocate the hostage under a small mountain of dry earth — Vahid is confronted with a stab of doubt. The man, whom we know to be the father of an adorable daughter and the husband of a very pregnant wife, insists that he doesn't have any idea what Vahid is talking about; that he never worked in a prison, and only lost his leg in an accident the previous year. 

Indeed, the scars in the flesh above his missing limb seem as if they're still in the process of healing. And so, however cathartic it might be to simply commit murder and call it vengeance, Vahid feels as though he has no choice but to stuff the man into a wooden crate, load him into his minivan, and drive around Tehran in search of other ex-prisoners who might be able to help verify the captive's identity.

 










So begins a gripping and tightly scripted misadventure that unfolds like something of a cross between Park Chan-wook's “Lady Vengeance” and Panahi's own “Taxi” (with a little “Waiting for Godot” thrown in for good measure), as Vahid's one-man truth and reconciliation commission grows to include a handful of other people whose skin carries the scars of “Peg Leg's” violence. Wedding photographer Shiva (Maryam Afshari, a karate referee in real life) is just starting to get her post-imprisonment career off the ground, but Vahid happens to find her while she's in the middle of shooting bride-to-be Golrokh (stage actress Hadis Pakbaten) who she met while in jail, and feels her own burning desire for justice — even on the day before her nuptials. “It Was Just an Accident” is also the first Panahi feature to show female characters not wearing the mandatory hijab — Shiva among them — here to reflect the rapid changes of Iranian society post-Woman, Life, Freedom movement, where women rebelled against the morality police overseeing their oppression.

Ensconced in her wedding dress, and already in a very emotional state of mind, Golrokh demands to join the fact-finding mission, forcing her hapless groom to come along for the ride (he's played by Panahi's nephew Majid). The increasingly absurd crew is soon completed by the addition of Hamid (carpenter Mohamad Ali Elyasmehr), a splenetic livewire whose fury makes it difficult to trust his conviction that Vahid's prisoner is the same man who terrorized these people when they were prisoners themselves. 

 










From the plot description alone, it's obvious that “It Was Just an Accident” finds Panahi working in a very different register than he had to while “banned” from making films — a period that saw his long-standing penchant for metafiction become considerably more pronounced, as he was forced to make himself the subject of iPhone/camcorder masterpieces like “This Is Not a Film.” This one still had to be shot in secret in order to skirt government approval, but it takes great pleasure in replacing the self-reflexivity of Panahi's illegal work with a slightly more formal sense of composition, even if it remains impossible to separate the final product from the personal experience that informed it.  

The difference is both immediate and also not. On the one hand, the opening scene begins in a car, the most familiar of locations in a filmography that has always shared Abbas Kiarostami's fascination with automobiles as places that are both public and private all at once. The bruised, crisp, and vaguely Lynchian texture of the images, however, is worlds removed from Panahi's usual aesthetic. 

It's late at night, and the man whom Vahid will soon take hostage is driving home with his wife and daughter when he runs over a dog in the road. It was, of course, just an accident, but the little girl in the backseat is furious with her dad all the same. “God simply put it in our path for a reason,” he rationalizes, before examining the animal's carcass in a primordial flood of fluorescent red brake lights (an image that Panahi will recreate later to breathless effect). “God had nothing to do with it,” the child replies.  

 










God's role in the series of events that follows is similarly hard to divine, as it is only because of this fateful accident that the man pulls his car into Vahid's warehouse. But despite its eventual willingness to resolve certain ambiguities, “It Was Just an Accident” derives so much of its throat-clenching power from the uncertainties at the heart of its premise. And not just the uncertainties, but also the overlapping truths — from the irreconcilable queasiness of existing in a country where the traumatized victims of the regime are forced to live as neighbors alongside the people who continue to enable it, with neither faction comfortable identifying themselves as such. 

So much of this film's urgency stems from Vahid's panicked enthusiasm at connecting with other people who share, and can validate, the pain of his experience (he's a stranger to the other characters, his meeting with Shiva facilitated by a mutual acquaintance from jail). But the pain of his experience — most acutely felt in Vahid's kidney — is also enflamed into a new anguish by the group's differing responses to the situation at hand. Some demand blood for blood while parroting the regime's logic that executing an innocent man will guarantee him a spot in heaven. Others insist there's no point, as any man guilty enough to be killed has already dug his own grave.

 










While the hostage spends most of the movie off-camera, his abductors are crammed into frames that contain all of their perspectives without privileging any of them. Uninterested in arguing that one response to a theocratic regime is superior to another (even if the filmmaker's natural empathy insists on the kind of lenience that Hamid doesn't want to hear), Panahi is instead compelled by how tempting it can be for the oppressed to adopt the same methods they suffered at the hands of their oppressor, and by the moral quagmire that results from diving into those waters. As one character sighs, “The deeper you go, the further you sink.” Or, as another character more bluntly offers: “What a heap of shit.” 

But it's the heap of shit that Vahid invites the rest of the film's ensemble to help him shovel, and “It Was Just an Accident” only grows more queasily arresting as the gang is forced to confront the moral ambivalence that burying their hostage at the bottom of it might require. As part of that process, the ex-prisoners are eventually invited to perform a certain kindness for the same man they would like to condemn; the narrative convenience might strain credibility, but that's a small price to pay for the unanswerable questions that it layers into Panahi's film, effectively deepening a self-conflicted parable into something richer and less resolved. 

 










Venom and mercy live side by side in Vahid's heart in much the same way as he and his friends are made to live among the men who so brutally dehumanized them as enemies of the state. Panahi's tense and woundingly distressed new film draws so much of its climactic power from the sense that hell will always follow Vahid like a whistle ringing in his ears, no matter what becomes of the man he's abducted. And even more of it from the implication that heaven must therefore be hiding somewhere close by. 

“It Was Just an Accident” premiered in Competition at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

The track will follow April's "What Was That."


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	After speaking out for the first time about her newfound gender identity leading up to new album Virgin, Lorde has announced that the project's next single will be “Man of the Year,” a track about embracing her own masculinity.


	On Monday (May 19), the pop star shared the track's cover art — a close-up photo of her chest covered by a strip of duct tape, the waistline of her jeans poking out from the bottom of the frame — and wrote on Instagram, “Man Of The Year. An offering from really deep inside me.” 

	











	“The song I'm proudest of on Virgin,” Lorde added. “Out next week.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Man of the Year” will mark the second track fans are getting from Virgin, which arrives June 27. The New Zealand native previously released “What Was That” in April, debuting at No. 36 on the Billboard Hot 100. 


	In her Rolling Stone cover story from earlier in May, Lorde opened up about writing “Man of the Year” after stopping her birth control and realizing that her gender felt more fluid than she previously realized. Just before penning the track, she taped her own chest with duct tape — just as it appears on the artwork — in an effort to realize a vision of herself “that was fully representative of how [her] gender felt in that moment,” she told the publication.


	“I felt like stopping taking my birth control, I had cut some sort of cord between myself and this regulated femininity,” she continued. “It sounds crazy, but I felt that all of a sudden, I was off the map of femininity. And I totally believed that that allowed things to open up.”


	Lorde would later tease “Man of the Year” through her 2025 Met Gala look, wearing a strapless, slate strip of fabric adhered to her chest that mirrored what the song's cover art would look like. “This is my creation,” she told Vogue‘s Emma Chamberlain on the red carpet at the time. “It's something of an Easter egg … To me it really represents where I'm at gender-wise. I feel like a man and a woman, kind of vibe.”


	The rollout cycle for Virgin — which will follow 2021's Solar Power — has marked the “Royals” singer's first time opening up about her broadening gender identity. Though she still prefers “she” and “her” pronouns, she explained to Rolling Stone, “[Chappell Roan] was like, ‘So, are you nonbinary now?' … I was like, ‘I'm a woman except for the days when I'm a man.'”

	











	Lorde has also shared that overcoming her struggles with an eating disorder — another experience that informed Virgin — allowed her to embrace her true identity. “I had made my body very small, because I thought that that was what you did as a woman and a woman on display,” she recently told Document Journal. “It had the effect of making me [feel] totally ungrounded. I was very weak. I look back now, and I don't have that same feeling of floating away.”

	The Department of Homeland Security oversees tens of thousands of arrests and detentions in the United States every year. It should go without saying that the department is responsible for ensuring that anyone in its custody is treated in accordance with the Constitution. It has long been clear that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is wholly unqualified to uphold that responsibility, but nowhere was it more apparent than Tuesday on Capitol Hill. 


	During a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday, Noem was asked by Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.): “What is habeas corpus?” 


	“Well habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country,” Noem replied, adding that Abraham Lincoln “used it.”


	Hassan interjected, noting that Noem was completely wrong. Habeas corpus, which is Latin for “you have the body,” is a person's right to challenge their detention, and requires the government to prove the detention is legally justified. Noem's response was literally the opposite of what habeus corpus actually means.

	According to the Constitution, the president does not have the authority to unilaterally suspend habeas corpus, and such a declaration must be approved by Congress. Earlier this month, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller suggested that the Trump administration was looking to suspend the habeas corpus rights of migrants in order to eliminate potential challenges to their detention and deportation. 


	“If not for that protection, the government could simply arrest people, including American citizens, and hold them indefinitely for no reason,” Hassan added. “So, Secretary Noem, do you support the core protection that habeas corpus provides that the government must provide a public reason in order to detain and imprison someone?” 


	Noem responded that while she supports the principle, she also had to “recognize that the president of the United States has the authority under the Constitution to decide if it should be suspended or not.”

	Hassan reminded Noem that such a suspension had “never been done without approval of Congress and that “even Abraham Lincoln got retroactive approval from Congress.”

	











	Later in the hearing, Noem was asked by Sen. Andy Kim (D-N.J.) if she understood “that any suspension of habeas corpus requires an act of Congress?”


	Noem replied: “President Lincoln executed habeas corpus in the past with a retroactive action of Congress. I believe that any president that was able to do that in the past, it should be afforded to our current-day president.” Noem claimed that while Trump hadn't directly indicated he planned a suspension, she felt he had the right to do so if so inclined. 


	When pressed, Noem could not name what constitutional article or section outlines the power, nor could she say how many times it had been invoked in American history.

	“Do you know which branch of government Article 1 outlines the tasks and the responsibilities for?” Kim asked, after informing Noem that the suspension clause was found in Article 1. 


	“Yes,” Noem replied. “Congress.”

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Having just finished shooting his untitled Tom Cruise movie in London, Alejandro González Iñárritu is here on the Croissette for the 25th anniversary of the pic that lit the wick on his career, Amores Perros. 


	Broken out in three separate stories, the gritty, violent movie follows an amateur dog fighter, a supermodel, and a derelict assassin, who are all separately struggling to find love, and discover their lives metamorphosized by a devastating car wreck in Mexico City. The movie, together with Alfonso Cuarón's 2001 young male sex odyssey Y Tu Mama Tambien and Guillermo del Toro's genre fantasia 2006 Pan's Labyrinth were bullhorns when it came to putting Mexican cinema on the global map. 

	











	“When I shot Amores Perros, I shot one million feet of celluloid. When I edited my film, it was 2 hours and 45 minutes, and that was 16,500 feet. Nine-hundred eighty-five thousand feet was left,” Iñárritu tells Deadline today.  That footage has been stored “like wine” in National University of Mexico per the 4x Oscar winner and in celebration of the movie's anniversary, a global immersive visual experience is being mounted with those clips in Milan at Fondazione Prada (Sept 18-Feb 26, 2026) and in Mexico City at LagoAlgo (Oct. 5-Jan. 3, 2026). There's also plans for an LA showcase as well. In addition, MACK books is releasing a book about the making of Amores Perros. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Iñárritu will return to London soon to edit the Cruise feature, temporarily titled Judy. Here's what he had to say about that Warner Bros theatrical release, due out on Oct. 2, 2026, as well as Amores Perros which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best International Film.


DEADLINE: Take us back to Amores Perros here at Cannes Critics Week 25 years ago. What was it like to make your big splash here? Your peers were already on their way in Hollywood: Guillermo del Toro had done Mimic in 1997, and Alfonso Cuarón made The Little Princess in 1995 and Great Expectations in 1998. 


ALEJANDRO G. IÑÁRRITU: In that time, in Mexico, there were only seven films produced a year. In 30 years, nobody had a film in the Cannes Film Festival beside one time Arturo Ripstein. Beside that we were invisible in international cinema. There was no national market for Mexican cinema. It was a horrible period, mostly all the films were subsidized by the government. You had to become a union member to become a cinematographer. It was a miracle (to get this film off the ground). At the time there was a company Altavista that decided to do a private finance company. It was a long script. I was doing a lot of advertising and radio, and they knew my work. They granted us $2 million. In Mexico, there was no career as a filmmaker. You did one film, and you were thankful that you had one chance. That chance, you had to put everything you thought, everything desire. That's why the movie is minimalistic and a guacamole of thick ideas of contradictions and this is about a tropological experiment that is our city, Mexico City. We poured all our hearts. I didn't have any expectations, and I did everything I could. We were young. The film came, I edited it in my home, and sent it to committee of Cannes to the Latin American guy who selected. He said, ‘No, this is very long, very violent' Can the committee see it? ‘No!' We were rejected by the guy who selects films for Latin America who presents to the guy who selects film. ‘Can they see it?' we asked. ‘No!' There was no Mexican distributor, there was no market. In that time, every single festival, Latin American Cinema was ghettoized, confined to the world cinema section of festivals.

	











	Then, José Maria Arriva, who was director of semeana critica, he saw the film, and sent us a love letter. He was the one who said ‘Come' and my mom said ‘you go to the parties that you're invited only.' And suddenly we presented the film. 


	At that time, Bernardo Bertolucci was the President of Critics Week. He invited us to have a lunch with the six other directors that we were competing. I present the film. Half of the screen went out in the middle. I smoked a pack of cigarettes. I arrive to Bertolucci full of nicotine to the lunch. He asked ‘How'd it go?' I said ‘Terrible, it's unbearable to present your film to the world's audience.' I was really shaken. I said, ‘This is the end. This is my first film; that's it. I told him ‘I envy you. That you are Bernardo Bertolucci and you shouldn't have that fear anymore.' He said, ‘Alejandro,' drinking his martini, elegantly dressed, he said ‘I have bad news for you. After the first film, everything gets worse.' In that time in 2000, they were doing a presentation in Cannes Classics of 1900, and as a young man, I couldn't understand of seeing your film 25 years later. And now I'm here 25 years later. Bernardo was right, every film gets worse. The reality is then the film became a huge thing and became incredibly successful around the time, and it became the talk of the town of why it wasn't in competition. Then, I think Guillermo, Alfonso and I — suddenly the Mexican cinema became part of the global conversation. 


DEADLINE: Looking back at the movie and what it's about — could you make it again? Do you still see Mexico through the same lens? 


AGI: Yes, even Mexico hasn't changed for the best. The violence at time in Mexico was super tough. We were assaulted when scouting with guns. We were scouting the dog fights house and I'm talking on the telephone, and there was a gun to my head, and my production designer was down on the ground with a gun to his head. They took our cameras. It was a gang. It was a crack neighborhood. At the end, we said ‘please don't do damage to anybody.' We were saved, but Ioved that scouting, because the scouting was perfect.  The line producer negotiated with the gang, and the exchange was that they would be appear in the film. Everybody who is in the background of the dog seats are the gangmembers. At this time, Mexico has become more difficult. 


DEADLINE: Was there an immediate buying frenzy or Lionsgate took it off the table?


AGI: I think they took it off the table. At the time, foreign language film, they've always been difficult. Altavista was handling that. The film broke records of attendance in Mexico. It was an interesting zeitgeist for at the time, the ruling political party in power for 70 years changed.


DEADLINE: Talk about how Hollywood called you up after the success of Amores Perros here.


AGI: I got an agent that was John Lesher, they were offering me big franchise films. I was already developing 21 Grams. Sean Penn was the one who called me. I met him at a party. He said, if you have something, let me know. I thought it was good for me to explore a film of religious fanaticism, and faith, and everything exploding the South of United States. 21 Grams became the first Focus Features produced film under James Schamus. It was my first American film, independently with final cut. 


Babel was Paramount and Brad Grey at that time. It was a third kind of exploration of connectiveness and non-linear structure. It was an ambitious films shot in various parts of the world. It cost us $25 million – nothing. It was difficult and beautiful and independently done by Paramount. That was a great time in cinema when the studios were supporting independent movies. 

	











DEADLINE: Can you tell us anything about Tom Cruise's stunts in your new film? Even on The Mummy there was a stunt 


AGI: The only thing I will tell you, and don't tell anybody, is that it's nothing of that. I'm so excited. It was an incredible experience with Tom, Sandra Huller, Jesse Plemmons, with Riz Ahmed, but it's a character driven film mounted on the shoulders of Tom which I knew he was exactly the right person. 


DEADLINE: Is it about what's been floating out there — that he's the most powerful global figure trying to convince everyone he's its savior?


AGI: No, the thing that I can tell you. This is a wild comedy of catastrophic proportions. It's insane. He makes me laugh every day. The range that I discovered working with Tom is unprecedented for me as a director. I was so fucking impressed and happy.  


DEADLINE: I have to imagine his tolerance for anything action assails DiCaprio's.


AGI: He gives himself. He has an incredible sense of passion. It's a brutal comedy. It's a wild comedy of human nature. It's scary and funny. It's beautiful. I will start editing next week. 


DEADLINE: With Revenant it was known that it was you versus the environment. But shooting in Pinewood in London, I would imagine, you're in a controlled situation. 


AGI: It was a very challenging film, you will see. It's many borders of many things. Every film challenges me. I don't like doing things that I've done already. This is something that we've never done and it's exciting as well. 


DEADLINE: Filmmakers, the industry love to knock streaming. But if it wasn't for Netflix, you wouldn't have been able to do your last film, Bardo. 


AGI: Absolutely. I didn't have any choice. Nobody wants to bet on a Spanish-language movie about immigrants. It broke every expectation of what a Mexican could talk about. It wasn't about cartels, or gangsters, or drug dealers. It was something that was very personal and unique. It has to do with a particular identity which is me and many other immigrants with some kind of nature of mine.

Hannah Kobayashi still isn't quite ready to talk about what happened. In November 2024, the 30-year-old was reported missing when she wasn't on her scheduled connecting flight from LAX to New York City, where she was meeting a family friend. When she was found in December, having traveled down to Mexico in what was reclassified as a voluntary missing person case, she learned her father had died by suicide just weeks prior. Kobayashi hasn't spoken much since, but recently returned to social media to begin parsing through her emotions.


	Per SFGate, Kobayashi shared an Instagram Story over the weekend that addressed the nationwide search that followed her apparent disappearance. She thanked “every single person who dedicated time and energy into looking for me,” a search she previously said she was unaware of as it was happening. Kobayashi also loosely detailed the more harrowing remnants of the experience. “Every day is such a gift, especially after such loss and pain and suffering,” she said. “We should all learn to be kind to one another.”

	











	Kobayashi's first Instagram post since the incident was shared on May 3. She shared a grayscale image of trees in a forest along with a long, poetic caption. “For all that i have yet to say, the love in my heart remains the same, for every being that exists and those to come…,” she wrote. “To go deep within and bear witness to your unwaivering resilience is a true remembrance. More powerful than you could ever imagine. Rise up against tyranny, rise up against hate. Overcome fear~and nothing will ever stop you from becoming that in which you are destined.”

	The comments on Kobayashi's posts are still publicly accessible, though some social media users have turned them into something more closely resembling an interrogation room. One commenter demanded answers as to why Kobayashi didn't attend her father's funeral, while others urged her to “seek help,” while emphasizing the pain and suffering they blame her for causing her family. Some comments were more sympathetic, including one user who shared the grief of their own experience losing their father.


	“You don't know the whole story,” Kobayashi responded to the user who asked about the funeral. “My intention in this post is to acknowledge that I am going to speak about my experience — and to stand up against all the hate that was cast upon me. I hope that in your darkest hours, you are shown compassion and love versus hate and judgment.”

With his groundbreaking solo tour and new singles, the artist is forging a deeper connection with fans, expanding his own path beyond BTS and looking toward even bigger milestones ahead.

	Billboard Korea



	Best known as a dancer, rapper and singer-songwriter in BTS, j-hope has long stood out, with a magnetic stage presence and captivating dance moves that helped propel the group to global stardom. Now — as ARMY around the world anticipate the group's remaining members completing South Korea's mandatory military service and BTS reuniting in June, with group activities on hold until 2026 — the charismatic 31-year-old is distinguishing himself further, carving out a bold solo identity that showcases a versatility and creative range that extend far beyond his BTS persona.

	











	Following his 2022 debut solo album, Jack in the Box, which peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard 200, and his 2024 Hope on the Street, Vol. 1 EP that rose to No. 5 on the chart, j-hope has already released collaborations this year with stars including Miguel, Don Toliver and Pharrell Williams. And with his Hope on the Stage World Tour, which kicked off Feb. 28 in Seoul, j-hope is reaching new heights: His show at Los Angeles' BMO Stadium made him the first South Korean male solo artist to headline a U.S. stadium. (His bandmate Jin will hit the road this summer.) The tour — which will wrap June 1 after visiting 15 markets across North America and Asia, including a May 31 show in Osaka, Japan, that will be broadcast live to cinemas around the world — has mirrored his own artistic growth as he prepares for the next stage of his solo journey with his upcoming album. J-hope sat down with Billboard Korea in Los Angeles for an exclusive chat about his music, touring and inspirations.


What does it mean to you to be on the cover of Billboard as a solo artist?


	Growing up, Billboard seemed like a completely different universe to me. I'd follow the charts to see where my favorite artists landed, and that's how I got a sense of the era's musical flow and what sounds were defining each moment. So having my own music recognized by Billboard still feels surreal and exciting. To me, Billboard remains a dreamlike presence, and the amazing thing is, that dream is still unfolding, much like my song, “Sweet Dreams.”


You're widely regarded as a symbol of hope — not only for your fans, but also for many Asian artists globally. How does it feel to have that kind of impact?












	Just as I drew inspiration from the artists I admired growing up, shaping my own music through their influence, I'd be honored if my work could inspire others and pass on that same positive energy — that would mean the world to me. Above all, I hope to continue growing into an artist who brings light and encouragement to others wherever I go.


Is there a particular message you want to convey with this tour?


	Embracing my identity as j-hope, I found myself reflecting more deeply on the true essence of hope. I realized it's not something to be taken lightly, so I wanted to channel that sincerity into my music and bring it to life through Hope on the Stage, sharing it with as many people as possible. I was hands-on with everything — stage design, choreography, fashion and even the props — pouring my heart into every aspect. I hope the audience left with a sense of genuine positivity and inspiration. Moving forward, I want to keep creating authentic performances that unite everyone through the power of music.


You made history in April as the first South Korean male solo artist to headline a U.S. stadium. How did that feel?


	Having performed at countless stadiums with BTS, I was always part of a seven-member team filling the stage. This time, I was on my own, and honestly, I wondered if I could handle that immense energy and pressure by myself. But I pulled it off and that means a lot to me — it's a milestone I'll always cherish.


You're often hailed as a fashion icon. What ignited your love of style?


	Ever since I was young, I've had a genuine passion for clothes. I don't really see myself as a fashionista — I just have a deep, genuine love for fashion. To me, clothing is a powerful way to express my identity. Even during BTS world tours, I'd make time to visit local boutiques and explore different styles, which really helped shape my personal aesthetic over time. For my solo world tour, I handpicked every outfit for each performance, ensuring every look was distinct. I believe my approach to fashion adds a fun, dynamic element for fans to enjoy while watching my shows.

	











Your recent single, “Mona Lisa,” debuted at No. 65 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was released in March two weeks after your Miguel collaboration, “Sweet Dreams.” What's the story behind these tracks?


	I believe my music should evolve as I grow. Before my enlistment, I leaned into my roots in dance, experimenting with a variety of sounds to express different facets of myself. But just a week after my discharge, I headed straight to the U.S. because I wanted to explore how the American producers I admire would interpret my sound. “Sweet Dreams” featuring Miguel — an artist I've long respected — has a smooth, soulful vibe that feels deeply personal. On the other hand, “Mona Lisa” brings a hip-hop-driven performance energy. Both tracks are easy to connect with, yet they offer a glimpse into the broader, more evolved musical world I'm building. This is just the start — I have plenty more musical experiments in store.

Spike Lee is calling out a bad call from the Academy more than 30 years later: The auteur, along with most cinephiles, is convinced that Denzel Washington was snubbed for the Best Actor Oscar for “Malcolm X.” Al Pacino instead won over Washington for “Scent of a Woman.” 

During the Cannes press conference for Lee's latest (and allegedly final) collaboration with Washington, “Highest 2 Lowest,” the director compared the Academy's decision to a poor referee call in basketball, something that Lee also knows all too well about given his status as the patron saint of the Knicks. 

 










“‘Malcolm X,' what he did with that film was amazing,” Lee said of Washington, as reported by Variety. “And no disrespect to my brother Al Pacino, I love him. But Denzel, in my opinion, should have won.”

Related Stories ‘A Magnificent Life' Review: Sylvain Chomet's Tribute to Marcel Pagnol Flies by Without Making an Impact ‘Jane Austen Wrecked My Life' Review: This Delightful, If Slight, French Trifle Riffs on Classic Romance 

Lee continued, “With these awards, it's like basketball, where the ref blows a call and you have to make a call. So the call I think was ‘Training Day,' which he won an Oscar for. But we don't do our work for awards, which are nice, but it's the work that is going to stand above all awards.” 

It was a decade later, exactly, that Washington won Best Actor for Antoine Fuqua's “Training Day.” And “Highest 2 Lowest” could propel Washington back into the awards circuit: IndieWire's David Ehrlich deemed Washington's performance “his most towering since ‘Training Day'” in the review. 

As for the legacy of “Malcolm X,” Lee paid tribute to the late civil rights activist, who would have been 100 during the festival. Washington also received a surprise Honorary Palme d'Or during the May 19 premiere of “Highest 2 Lowest,” with Cannes festival heads Thierry Frémaux and Iris Knobloch presenting the award onstage ahead of the screening. Washington had to sit out the press conference for the film, though, as the star had to immediately return to New York to resume leading the Broadway show “Othello.”

When asked if he and Washington plan to collaborate more after their five films together, Lee said, “I think this is it. He's been talking about retirement, so…Even though he just did another deal [for “Here Comes the Flood”].” (To note, Washington has also already confirmed his role in Ryan Coogler's “Black Panther 3”.) 

Lee added, “I thought you said you were retired Denzel, what's up?! But those five films together, those stand up.”

 










Lee reunited with longtime collaborator Washington for his English-language reimagining of Japanese director Akira Kurosawa's 1963 film “High and Low.” The duo previously collaborated on “Inside Man,” “Mo' Better Blues,” “Malcolm X,” and “He Got Game.” “Highest 2 Lowest” will be released August 22 from A24 followed by an Apple TV+ streaming premiere via Apple Original Films in September.

Yet don't count Washington out of another Lee joint entirely: The actor did say earlier this year that he would work with him again. “Spike is consistently Spike, and I love that about him,” Washington said. “And I love working with him, and I'd work with him again. I just like the way his brain works.”

The 'Thelma' actress plays an older woman who tells a lie that takes on a life of its own in a film co-starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Erin Kellyman and Jessica Hecht.

Arts & Culture Critic


	In her directorial debut Eleanor the Great, Scarlett Johansson tries to shape a portrait of aging, loneliness and grief in America through the misadventures of her eponymous protagonist, played by the reliably funny June Squibb (Thelma). You want Eleanor the Great to succeed because of its charming lead and compelling premise (the screenplay is by Tory Kamen), but it struggles to find its groove. The film lurches between comic set pieces and more dramatic beats, and while Johansson proves a competent helmer, it's not enough to overcome some dizzying tonal imbalances. Still, at the very least, Eleanor the Great offers a character-driven break from the glut of sequels, prequels and whatever else studios squeeze out of existing IP.

	The film, which premiered in the prestigious Un Certain Regard sidebar, strikes me as a peculiar choice for Cannes. A more fitting venue for this feel-good movie might have been Sundance or TIFF; its strengths recall the mid-budget comedy-dramas of the 90s — charismatic lead, relatively strong supporting actors and a story that's comforting in its predictability and mandatory suspension of disbelief.

The Bottom Line

	
	Compelling premise, uneven execution.
	



Venue: Cannes Film Festival (Un Certain Regard)Cast: June Squibb, Erin Kellyman, Jessica Hecht, Rita Zohar, Chiwetel EjioforDirector: Scarlett JohanssonScreenwriter: Tory Kamen

									Rated PG-13,
								1 hour 38 minutes			






	The film follows Eleanor Morgenstein (Squibb), a 94-year-old woman forced to return to New York and move in with her daughter Lisa (Jessica Hecht) after her best friend Bessie (Rita Zohar) unexpectedly dies. The transition proves difficult when the nonagenarian realizes that no one has any time for her. In an attempt to find community, Eleanor looks for activities at her local Jewish Community Center, where her daughter has signed her up for singing classes. An awkward misunderstanding lands her in a group for Holocaust survivors, and instead of correcting the mistake, Eleanor adopts her dead best friend's Holocaust survival stories as her own. This leads Eleanor to befriend Nina (Erin Kellyman), a 19-year-old journalism student who wants to write about Eleanor's experiences. 


	It's a bold premise that could have worked better. Eleanor the Great attributes the titular character's dubious actions to grief and isolation. But that framing isn't asserted early or forcefully enough to be convincing, so what might have been a fascinating and somber study of an elderly woman seeking connection after the death of her closest friend becomes an uneven and sometimes trying chronicle of a pretty weird scheme. Stronger and more meaningful points in the film involve Eleanor undergoing a second coming of age by preparing for the bat mitzvah she never had as a child and striking up a friendship with Nina. 

	











Eleanor the Great opens with a great sequence that establishes Eleanor and Bessie's life together. The two women have been friends for decades and decided to share a small house in Florida after their respective husbands died. Their routines include early morning chats over coffee, weekly runs to the grocery store and watching their favorite anchor Roger (Chiwetel Ejiofor) on the evening news.  


	Johansson's direction is assured here, establishing the intimacy between these two older women with the kind of endearing eye usually reserved for stories about girlhood. These and some other, later moments in the film reminded me of how Sarah Friedland captured aging as its own coming-of-age in her brilliant debut Familiar Touch. Working with DP Hélène Louvart (La Chimera), Johansson, like Friedland, represents becoming an elder as an equally energizing chapter of adulthood.


	When Bessie dies, Eleanor is gutted and feels unmoored. More scenes of the nonagenarian grappling with the realities of that mourning would have strengthened the film by offering a more persuasive foundation for her later decisions. Instead, Johansson moves quickly, and before we know it Eleanor is returning to New York to live with her daughter and grandson Max (Will Price). It doesn't take long for her to realize that neither Lisa, who is reeling from a divorce, nor Max, a teenager, has much time for her.


	Eleanor ends up at the Holocaust survivor group by complete accident, but she doesn't remedy the misunderstanding, because she prefers the community within that group to the theater adults in the singing class Lisa signed her up for. In a spur-of-the-moment decision, when prompted to introduce herself, she adopts Bessie's biography as her own. 

	











	Nina, a journalism student looking for her next story, is deeply moved by Eleanor's falsified narrative about escaping from Poland and coming to the U.S. Although Eleanor initially rejects Nina's pleas for a profile, the cub reporter's persistence pays off. The two embark on a sweet friendship that I wish had more time to gestate. Nina's mother, who was Jewish, recently died, and her father (who Eleanor doesn't know is the news anchor, Roger) is too subsumed by his own sadness to pay attention to her, so the relationship with Eleanor becomes a source of real comfort. 


	The comedic elements of Eleanor the Great work mostly because of Squibb's solid performance as the sometimes cantankerous and slightly overbearing mother. At 94, her character is still relatively independent and spiky, and it's funny to watch her snap at younger people who assume otherwise. 


	Things start to get shaky when Johansson dials down the comedy to lean into more serious turns. The shift is bumpy in part because the performances don't align with the new, theoretically heightened stakes of the story. Eleanor's dishonesty puts her in more precarious situations, including having to speak to journalism students about ethical storytelling and a local news channel's interest in airing a segment about her.


	The introduction of an additional thread about Roger and Nina's relationship is sweet, but doesn't have much time to develop, which only highlights how underused Ejiofor and Kellyman are. These new plotlines clutter up Eleanor the Great where condensing might have been a better choice. Most disappointingly, we never really get a good sense of Eleanor's interior life, which means that the film's ambitions ultimately feel unfulfilled.

When Jennifer Farber Dulos, a Brooklyn-raised daughter of great wealth and privilege, a member of the Brown Class of 1990 and once a member of the New York's downtown literary elite, vanished after dropping her five kids off at the New Canaan Country School on the morning of May 24, 2019, people in Fairfield County, Connecticut — especially those familiar with the area's thorny divorce court — entered a collective breakdown. The handsome husband and beautiful South American paramour, the failing marriage and business, the anxieties of the suburban sports parent, battles over money and status — the case, which made newspapers around the nation, touched on the fears of every parent. It was like a camera dropped into the subconscious of America's wealthiest towns. At its core, Jennifer's story — presumed dead, her body has never been found — personified every struggling mother's worst nightmare. The language in the first police reports said it perfectly: “Lying in wait.” 












That's what Fotis Dulos, Jennifer's estranged husband, was presumed to have been doing when his wife was idling through the drop off line at school: “lying in wait” for Jennifer, whose demise would be discerned in a handful of clues found in a dumpster fifty miles north — a bloody Vineyard Vine's T-shirt, bloody zip ties, a bloody bra. What follows is a section from my book, Murder in the Dollhouse: the Jennifer Dulos Story, that details the first hours of the investigation, the moves the small town police department made after the panicked calls arrived from Jennifer's friends. Fotis would be charged with her murder and die by suicide while awaiting trial; his girlfriend would later be convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. Jennifer's story remains a fixation not because it's unusual or strange, but because it's so familiar. It illuminates a dark river that flows beneath our everyday lives.


	***


	The New Canaan Police station is in a brick building at 174 South Avenue. There are columns in front and a sign over the door. If the department seems small, with just forty-five officers tasked with protecting more than twenty thousand residents, that's because New Canaan has always been one of the safest towns in Connecticut. It's where New York City police go when they ascend to cop heaven. The citizens are rich, the kids future-oriented, the domestics documented. Now and then, an entire year goes by without a single violent episode.

	The stories of murder in New Canaan are legends because there have been so few of them. In 1969, a ten-year-old named Mary Mount vanished off her New Canaan street, sparking a manhunt unmatched in town until the search for Jennifer Dulos. Mount's body was found in the South Norwalk Reserve shortly after her disappearance. The killing remains unsolved. On December 10, 1970, a New Canaan father returned from his job at Hi-Standard Manufacturing in Hamden, Connecticut, to find four members of his family — wife, daughter, son, and mother — slaughtered in their house at 93 Millport Avenue. The murder weapons included dagger, hatchet, hammer, necktie. A surviving son, seventeen-year-old John Rice, was the only suspect. “The youth, an avid outdoorsman who was to be promoted to Eagle Scout last night, is about 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds,” the Hartford Courant reported. “He has dark brown hair, wears glasses and has a severe case of acne.” Rice turned himself in on December 16, 1970. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity. In 2021, seventy-seven-year-old Albert Kokoth killed his seventy-five-year-old wife. He said he shot her by accident. Though the first shot might have indeed been a mistake, the second, third, and fourth shots probably weren't.


	All to say, when the missing persons call came for Jennifer Dulos, the entire department took notice. The investigation, which would be the most expensive in Connecticut state history, started with a re- quest to Verizon. The police wanted information on Jennifer's phone: When had it last been used? What cell tower had it “pinged”? When you make a call, the signal bounces off the nearest tower and up into space, reaches a satellite, and then rebounds to the phone of the person you dialed. With basic geometry—these three points (tower, satellite, receiver) describe an immense triangle — you can determine the location of any cell phone, present or past.

	According to Verizon, Jennifer's phone last pinged a tower near Waveny Park in New Canaan at 11:09 Friday morning, May 24, 2019.


	Captain Andrew Walsh and Sergeant Kenneth Ventresca of the New Canaan Police Department went to Waveny Park on the night of the disappearance in search of Jennifer's Chevy Suburban. They found it on Lapham Road near the edge of the park at 8:00 p.m. “The tailgate was backed up against this tree,” Sergeant Ventresca reported. “The Suburban was not running; keys were not in the ignition. The gear le- ver was actually stuck in reverse. The doors were locked . . . You could see the cleanup of the blood-like substance all over the passenger side under a flashlight.”

	











	Two different New Canaan cops, Officer Matthew Blank and Sergeant Aaron LaTourette, had gone to Jennifer's house at 69 Welles Lane at around 7:00 p.m. They knocked on the door, heavy service belts creaking. Leaf shadows, night noises. No answer. They phoned the Dulos' nanny, Lauren Almeida, who gave them the garage door code. They typed the numbers by the glow of the pad. The door opened. The search began by flashlight. There was what looked like blood on the floor and what looked like blood splatter on the Range Rover.


	They continued into the house. The record from their police body cam, which was shown at the Stamford courthouse in 2024, resembles footage taken of the interior of a wrecked ship, the ghostly halls and haunted rooms suggesting sudden disaster. There's an Andy Warhol silkscreen of Jackie O. — Jennifer fetishized America's fashionable wives — a picture of the Dulos children, and, on the second floor, closets filled with children's shoes and clothes. A silver C-shaped Mylar balloon — possibly for Jennifer's daughter, Clea-Noelle — is tied to a counter in the kitchen. Straining at its tether, this balloon functioned as a clock — according to a company called Balloon Party Palace, “In optimum environments, mylar (foil) balloons will remain full and taut for 3–5 days” — demonstrating the temporal closeness of zero hour.


	“In addition to blood evidence in the garage, there was evidence that someone had attempted to clean up blood,” the state police detective John Kimball, who helped oversee the investigation, said later. “There were what appeared to be swirl marks on the sides of the vehicles.”


	Officer Thomas Patten, who examined the garage more thoroughly the next day, cataloged additional evidence:


	•   Blood splatter found on the garbage cans


	•   Blood splatter on the driver's side door


	•   Swipes where someone tried to clean up concrete floor


	•   Partial bloody shoe prints


	•   A quarter sized blood drop on the right fender on the range rover


	•   The left front fender had been wiped clean


	At this point, per procedure, the New Canaan police called in the Major Crimes Unit of the Connecticut State Police, which had been created to work on just such cases. From there, it became a joint investigation, with the state cops supplying high-tech gadgets and expertise, and the local cops supplying on-the-ground knowledge of the town.

	











	Within forty-eight hours, the investigators, using cell phone and internet data, had pieced together Jennifer's last known whereabouts.


	Friday, May 24, 2019:


	7:50 a.m.: Jennifer Dulos is seen on neighborhood security cameras driving Chevy Suburban down Welles Lane in New Canaan.


	7:58 a.m.: Jennifer Dulos is seen arriving in Chevy Suburban at New Canaan Country School.


	8:05 a.m.: Jennifer Dulos is seen on surveillance driving toward her house on Welles Lane. 


	10:25 a.m.: Jennifer Dulos' Chevy Suburban is seen leaving Welles Lane.


	10:38 a.m.: Jennifer Dulos' Chevy Suburban is seen on camera near Waveny Park on Lapham Road in New Canaan.


	11:09 a.m.: Jennifer Dulos' phone goes dark.


	“DID YOU EVER HEAR OF something called luminol?” an investigator asked Michelle Troconis later.


	No.


	“Luminol is something we use to look at evidence,” said the cop. “To see if blood was somewhere. When it hits blood, it illuminates.”


	For example, said the cop, we covered the inside of Jennifer's garage on Welles Lane with luminol.


	Handing Michelle a photo of the garage, the cop pointed out illuminated patches, saying, “It's all that.”


	“That's blood?” asked Michelle.


	Yes, said the cop. “And who do you think that [blood] belongs to?” In an interview, Kathryn Pinneri, who in 2022 served as president of the National Medical Examiners Association, told me: “When luminol touches a place blood has been, even if the blood's been cleaned up, it turns fluorescent. If there's been hemoglobin on a surface, the luminol turns blue. You have to turn the lights off to see it. There's an eerie glow. It can also show how much blood has been spilled.


	“It depends on the age and size of the person, but, on average, we have about five liters of blood in our body. Most people can tolerate losing as many as two liters of that blood. If you lose three liters and don't replace it immediately, you're going to die.”                                                     


	According to Connecticut's chief medical examiner, James Gill, who worked the case, the amount of blood seemingly spilled in the garage probably means Jennifer Dulos sustained an injury or injuries that would have been “non-survivable” without medical intervention.

	











	FOTIS SEEMED DETACHED WHEN the police got him on the phone that first night. Maybe it was his Greek accent, or all that Ivy League education, but his demeanor was strangely disengaged. You'd expect a man whose estranged wife had just gone missing to be emotional, confused. But no, nothing. “Mr. Dulos never seemed concerned about his wife,” an officer on the call said later.


	Officer Thomas Patten asked Fotis to come by the New Canaan police station the next day. There was nothing accusatory in this request. It was standard. The police were trying to find Jennifer, and wanted the husband's help. Fotis said he'd be there at around 12:00 p.m., Saturday, May 25.


	Fotis did not arrive until 2:47 p.m. He'd asked his lawyer Jacob Pyetranker to go with him. Like many of Fotis's decisions, this one was halfway smart. “Halfway” because when the police call you into the station a day after your estranged wife has vanished, it's smart to have an attorney, but only “halfway” because Jacob Pyetranker is not a criminal attorney. He's a divorce lawyer, and he seemed beyond his depth from the start. He got in and out of the criminal case fast, but not before watching his client make a critical mistake.


	Fotis arrived before Pyetranker. He should have waited for his attorney in the parking lot, but, because he was an arrogant man who believed he had everything under control, he went into the station by himself. The New Canaan police officer Thomas Patten and the Connecticut State Police officer Christopher Allegro met him in the lobby. Detective Patten later said Fotis seemed flustered. He had a look that cops recognize — a person trying to maintain composure, trying to hide out in the open.


	Fotis spoke first, another mistake. If you are meeting with police, you should volunteer nothing; even your tone of voice can give you away. Let the police start by telling you what they know.


	Fotis asked if there'd been any news about his wife. One cop said no.


	The other said that's why Fotis was there; they needed his help finding her.


	Then Pyetranker came in. He told the police that his client would “not be cooperating.”


	The officers said they were “surprised Dulos would not help.” Pyetranker said he and his client would be leaving.


	Pyetranker handed something to Dulos.


	“Is that your phone?” one of the cops asked. Fotis said, “Yes.”


	The cop asked to see it.


	As if subject to mind control, Fotis handed his phone to Officer Allegro.

	











	The cop tapped the screen until the security prompt appeared. “What's the code?” he asked Fotis.


	“0—0—0—0.”


	Officer Allegro typed it in.


	Pyetranker protested, saying that the police officers were not al- lowed to look at Fotis's phone.


	“I'm not looking at it,” said Officer Allegro. “I'm securing the phone and data it contains.” He added that he was putting the phone in air- plane mode until he could get a search warrant.


	Pyetranker stared at the cop. The cop stared back. Now and then, when someone is thinking very deeply, you can almost hear the gears turning.


	Pyetranker said he needed to confer with his client alone. They went outside to talk. A moment later, without saying goodbye to the police, Fotis and his lawyer got in their cars and drove away.


	WAS FOTIS DULOS CAPABLE of murder? That was a key question for the police and a stumbling block for friends. Here was a man who had never been arrested, who, as far as anyone knew, had never committed a violent act, not even during the most intense marital squabbles. How could he suddenly become a killer?


	I asked professionals, criminologists, cops, and psychiatrists if a person who commits murder is on the same spectrum as everyone else. That is, can an otherwise healthy person become a person who kills, not in self-defense or in the heat of battle, but with cool premeditation? Or are killers different from the rest of us? There is no consensus, but, according to research, nearly 5 percent of the human population can be classified as psychopathic.


	For those closest to Fotis, the best defense can be summed up in one sentence: He was simply not capable of murder. Ethan Fry, writing for the Stamford Advocate in July 2019, described his interview with Fotis's sister, Rena Dulos Kyrimi: “[She] is an architect in Athens, where she said Fotis still has many friends and family members who do not believe he would be capable of harming his wife.” As Fotis was growing up, Rena, who was thirteen years older, had operated as something like a guardian. “I almost raised him,” Rena told Fry. “I know him so very well.”


	Those who had seen Fotis and Jennifer argue in Farmington disagree. “I was there when they fought on the lawn,” a neighbor told me. “I was there when he got angry. I heard his sick revenge fantasies. I heard him say what he was going to do to this or that person. I don't know what he did or did not do to Jennifer, but I did not consider him harmless.” 

	











	FOTIS LEFT MESSAGES FOR LAUREN Almeida, the nanny, on the afternoon of Jennifer's disappearance, then left several more that night. He said he was merely checking in, but what he really wanted was the children. If step one had been “Disappear Jennifer,” step two was “Get the kids.”


	Lauren texted back to tell him the kids were healthy and safe. “Thanks for your response,” wrote Fotis. “Please send me updates every three hours. I do not want to feel that I am pestering you, but please understand that I am the father and I am extremely concerned with the situation.”


	He asked, for the second time, if everyone was together at his mother-in-law Gloria's apartment in Manhattan. Lauren did not respond. Then, at noon on Sunday, May 26, Fotis showed up in Gloria's Fifth Avenue lobby. He tried to walk straight to the elevators, but the doorman stopped him. He'd been told to watch for Fotis. If he turns up, the doorman was instructed, don't let him in. “He is unwelcome in Gloria's residence.”


	For a moment, while arguing with the doorman, the glassy veneer that Fotis wore all through these tragic hours fell away. He must've known this was his best and possibly only chance: Get the kids and go. Argentina. Greece. The world has amnesia. If you stay away long enough, everything will be forgotten. But if you don't escape now, you'll be trapped like a fly in glue.


	He and the doorman argued. Grunts and curses, the shuffle of loafers on waxed marble. Gloria was in the apartment with Lauren and the kids. Carrie Luft, Jennifer's friend, was in the apartment with Gloria, Lauren, and the kids. What were the kids thinking? They loved their father. He was so close, an elevator ride away, and yet, though they could not know it, he was already gone.


	Carrie called 911. Cops from the New York Police Department were there in minutes. They broke up the fight, talked to the doorman, talked to Fotis. He told them that his mother-in-law had abducted his children. He was there to take them home. The New York cops called the police station in New Canaan, where an officer said, “Fotis Dulos is prohibited by court order from visiting with his children unsupervised.”


	The cops told Dulos to leave. Go away, cool off. According to the NYPD, “Dulos ultimately complied.” That “ultimately” suggests Fotis was not so quick to walk away.


	On Tuesday morning, May 28, Fotis's new divorce lawyer — Michael Rose, the third man on the case  —filed papers asking that Fotis Dulos be given full custody of the Dulos children.

	











	The timeline:


	Jennifer disappears on Friday, May 24.


	Fotis shows up at Gloria's building on Sunday, May 26. Fotis files for full custody on Tuesday, May 28.


	Why full custody?


	Maybe because he knew Jennifer was never coming back.

Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have spent much of the NFL offseason together, and now, Kelce may have casually confirmed what fans have suspected for months: they're living together. During the May 14 episode of his “New Heights” podcast, Kelce slipped a telling detail that immediately sent the internet into overdrive.

“We've got chimneys and we've got furniture,” Kelce said with a grin, using “we” in a way that Swifties instantly clocked as a soft confirmation of their shared home life.

While Travis Kelce didn't outright say he and Taylor Swift live together, his choice of words during the “New Heights” podcast was enough. “We've got chimneys and we've got furniture,” he said while discussing home upgrades, emphasizing “we.”

The comment follows a string of insider reports suggesting the couple has been living together on and off since late 2023. According to the Daily Mail, Swift reportedly spent the holidays at Kelce's $6 million Kansas City estate. Since then, sources say the couple has split their time between Swift's homes and Kelce's during the pop star's “gap year” from touring.

“They get their own workouts in together just as other young couples in love do,” one source told Daily Mail. “She finds him the most romantic man she has ever been with, and he is all about making her comfortable.”

Reportedly, Swift starts her day with yogurt, eggs, and a latte—while Kelce, ever the supportive partner, gives her massages and is careful not to use “even half of his strength.” For a couple often under public scrutiny, they seem to be enjoying a very normal, domestic rhythm.

Kelce also made headlines for a playful moment at teammate Patrick Mahomes' “15 and the Mahomies” charity gala in Las Vegas. Though Taylor Swift did not attend, she still contributed—donating a signed guitar for the event's auction.

A fan-captured video shows Kelce standing by his table, paddle in hand, watching as bids climbed on Swift's autographed item. As the moment heated up, Kelce cheekily backed out and said, “I just realized I have that already.”

Whether he was referring to the actual guitar or another personalized Swift item remains unclear, but the room—including Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes—burst into laughter. Many fans speculated Kelce may have been trying to drive up the bidding before pulling back, adding yet another layer of charm to the viral moment.

The clip quickly spread across social media, earning more than 10,000 likes on X (formerly Twitter). One comment captured the mood perfectly: “Aww, his comment is soooo cute!”

Britta Phillips, the original singing voice of Jem, tells Billboard all about returning to the iconic '80s cartoon character for these songs.

	Grab your synthesizer, pink wig and star earrings – Jem is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. To commemorate four decades of Jem and the Holograms, Hasbro is releasing a new album of Jem and the Holograms songs.

	The series – which ran from 1985-1988 and inspired Jon M. Chu's live action 2015 film Jem and the Holograms – combined music, sci-fi and a storyline that more than like inspired Hannah Montana (Jem is the secret rock star alter ego of Jerrica Benton). The show's '80s fashion was truly outrageous (truly, truly, truly outrageous) and its glimmering synth-pop tunes were, as the Jem theme song promised, undeniably “contagious.”

Billboard can reveal that in July, a 40th anniversary album for Jem will come out on vinyl and digital streaming platforms via Hasbro. The project includes six re-recorded tracks from the ‘80s series, held down by the original singing voice of Jem, Britta Phillips.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Seriously, I was thrilled to be asked to sing these songs again,” Phillips tells Billboard. “I had listened to and sang many Jem songs at Jemcon last year, so they were very fresh in my mind. And I'm so excited for the Jem fans to hear them.”


	Those six songs are the Jem theme song, “Only The Beginning,” “Truly Outrageous,” “Like A Dream,” “I Got My Eye On You” and “She's Got The Power.” You can listen to “Jem and the Holograms Theme (Reimagined)” right now thanks to a glamor and glitter, fashion and fame-filled music video below.


	Listening to the reimagined theme song, it's hard to believe this is Phillips' voice four decades later – she sounds almost exactly the same as she did on the O.G. series. That's especially impressive when you spin her post-Jem music, such as her 2016 album Luck or Magic, which found her adopting a more mature, dreamy vocal tone. But it seems that the spirit of Jem was still inside her, ready to return (even without the help of supercomputer Synergy).


	“I took a couple of voice lessons before the recording sessions which helped with my confidence in belting those crazy high notes, but luckily the sound of my voice and my vocal range hasn't changed much. It's still pretty girlish,” Phillips tells Billboard. “To my surprise, the high notes weren't difficult. We even kept the songs in the original key except for one track where we dropped down a half step – and that one didn't have the highest notes. The biggest challenge was singing at such fast tempos (the original tempos), but it was very exciting and nostalgic for me, and I had a blast! And working with these amazing and talented producers (all female!) was inspiring,” she adds, tipping to the female-led team behind this anniversary album.

	











	Of the re-recorded songs, Phillips says “Only the Beginning” – a song that appeared in the series pilot, which aired Oct. 6, 1985 – was “the most emotional one to sing. It brought me back to my beginning and so it felt like a full circle of my life from the very beginning of my musical career to the present.”


	Phillips says returning to “She's Got the Power” was also exciting for her. “It felt much like it did when I first recorded those songs, except now I know those little kids I sang to are all grown up! Makes me a little teary.”

	“The last time I was in this room, I was apologizing for the f*ck-up,” filmmaker Spike Lee joked this morning as he walked into the press conference room in Cannes. 


	The legendary New York filmmaker was referring to 2021, when he served as the Cannes jury president and prematurely announced Titane as the Palme d'Or winner during the closing-night ceremony. 


	Lee is back here in Cannes with his latest feature, Highest 2 Lowest, a modern “reinterpretation” of Akira Kurosawa's 1963 classic High and Low, which was itself based on the novel King's Ransom by Ed McBain. While the original follows a shoe company exec who becomes a victim of extortion when his chauffeur's son is kidnapped by mistake and held for ransom, the new film, set in contemporary New York City, sees a music mogul played by Denzel Washington contend with a similar plot.

	From Apple and A24, the film reunites Lee and Washington for the first time since Inside Man back in 2006. The duo has worked together five times, their credits are including Mo' Better Blues, Malcolm X, and He Got Game.

	“Denzel and I didn't know that our previous film, Inside Man, was 18 years ago. We were surprised because it felt like yesterday. But we didn't miss a step,” Lee said of working with Washington, who received an honorary Palme d'Or before last night's premiere screening of Highest 2 Lowest.

	“I think this is it — five,” Lee added of his collaboration with Washington. “He's been talking about retirement, even though he's just done another deal. Five films together, they stand up.”

	This is Lee's sixth time in the Cannes Official Selection, and Monday's premiere marked 36 years to the day since his first appearance with Do the Right Thing. During the presser, Lee was asked about the critical response to that film back in 1989, particularly around critics who said it would cause riots.

	“I've had a great experience with this festival, and the people who had their various opinions about Do The Right Thing had nothing to do with the festival. It was just the press,” Lee said.

	“They said Do the Right Thing would cause riots and Black people would lose their minds,” he added. “They were telling people to hope to God this film didn't open in their neighborhood. It was pure blatant racism to suggest Black people couldn't make the distinction between what's on the screen. They all misread it, and none of them admitted that they f*cked up.” 


Highest 2 Lowest was shot across New York, with elaborate action scenes in the Bronx, set against the backdrop of Yankee Stadium. During the presser, Lee was asked about shooting in New York and how he thinks the recent drop in production in the city could be resolved.


	“People are hurting, people whose lives are dependent on working in the film industry,” he said. “The guy [Donald Trump] just said he wants to put a tariff on films made outside the United States. I don't know how that's gonna work. But I don't have the answer for that.” 


	The filmmaker said he simply feels lucky to have been able to shoot several films in New York, adding that he often has pushed back on attempts to make him shoot his New York-based films outside the city.

	“For Do the Right Thing, they wanted us to shoot that film in Baltimore,” Lee said. “Get the f*ck outta here. We were never doing that.” 


	Slated to hit select theaters August 22 before arriving on Apple TV+ on September 5, Highest 2 Lowest is written by Alan Fox and Lee. Todd Black produced for Escape Artists, alongside Jason Michael Berman for Mandalay Pictures. Exec producers included Lee for 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks, and Mandalay's Peter Guber, as well as Juniper Productions' Matthew Lindner, Chris Brigham, and Katia Washington. Mandalay's Jordan Moldo served as co-producer.

"This is not a show that needs a male savior": The actors, co-showrunners and more speak out about the fatal second-to-last episode of the Hulu drama.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


[This story contains MAJOR spoilers from season six, episode nine of The Handmaid's Tale, “Execution.”]


	There's no such thing as a good Commander.




The Handmaid's Tale‘s writers have been passing along that message to viewers throughout the sixth and final season of the Hulu series. When Nick (Max Minghella) shocked his lover June (Elisabeth Moss) with the Jezebel's betrayal, her husband Luke (O-T Fagbenle) argued it's because he's a Nazi. When Wharton (Josh Charles) surprised his new wife with a handmaid on their wedding night, Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski) remembered June's warning: Wharton can't be a good man, because he's a man of Gilead.

	Yet killing three High Commanders is still a shocking final-season surprise: In the penultimate episode, titled “Execution” (written by co-showrunner Eric Tuchman and directed by star Elisabeth Moss), Nick Blaine, Joseph Lawrence (Bradley Whitford) and Gabriel Wharton all perished. Lawrence was planning to plant an altitude-triggered bomb on a plane of High Commanders and flee while working with June and the Mayday revolution to take out some of Gilead's most extremist male leaders. But when Wharton (Charles) and the others arrived early, Lawrence made a self-sacrificial choice to get on the plane and carry out his agenda. At the last minute, Nick joined them on the plane.


	The poignant final scene between June allies Nick and Lawrence saw Minghella and Whitford, who are close friends in real life, reflecting about the heroic former handmaid. Lawrence knew it was their final conversation; Nick did not. “She told me to give all this up,” Nick said to Lawrence, who replied, “You should have listened to her.” Lawrence had a touching goodbye with June before he stepped on the plane, but Nick and June — the show's biggest romance since season one — never got that moment. When June watches as the plane explodes in the sky, her emotions, conflicted and raw, also speak for the audience.


	The deaths are a turning point in the final season resistance against Gilead. Earlier in the episode, the majority of the female cast was nearly wiped out when June, a newly revolutionized Aunt Lydia, undercover CIA agent Aunt Ava (D'Arcy Carden), Moira (Samira Wiley), Janine (Madeline Brewer) and other handmaids were almost hanged to death as punishment for murdering Commanders in episode eight's wedding night coup. But just as June screamed the handmaids' rallying cry, “Don't let the bastards grind you down!,” Luke, former Martha Rita (Amanda Brugel) and Mayday fighters arrived to save June and the women as planes invaded the Gilead-run Boston.

	











	Below, in separate conversations with The Hollywood Reporter, Minghella, Whitford, Moss, show creator Bruce Miller, Tuchman and season six co-showrunner Yahlin Chang, and executive producer Warren Littlefield share how they decided on and carried out a moving end for two of the show's most influential characters as the series heads into its final episode.


	***


ERIC TUCHMAN [writer, season six co-showrunner] We decided on Nick and Lawrence's deaths when we were first breaking the season. Once we decided on Nick's betrayal midway, that led to his fate — and Lawrence's combined with that. We pitched the season to Hulu, MGM [Television], Lizzie [Moss goes by “Lizzie”] and all the creatives, their deaths included. Hearing that part of the pitch made Lizzie raise her hand and say, “I want to direct that one, too.” She was already directing the finale. She was on board immediately, as was Max.


ELISABETH MOSS [“June/Offred,” executive producer, director] I was in Paris shooting The Veil when they pitched us the whole season, outline by outline. I hung up from that meeting, and I said, “I have to direct episode nine.” I humbly requested and they very kindly said yes. If Nick and Lawrence are going to go, it has to be me.


TUCHMAN It's such a huge moment in the show. It hopefully has a lot of impact. She recognized that would be really juicy to direct. 


YAHLIN CHANG [writer, season six co-showrunner] Lizzie pitched it to Max first on the set of their indie movie Shell [directed by Minghella that starred Moss]. She told him something like, “You're going to die in the coolest way.” (Laughs) So she kind of prepared him.

	











MAX MINGHELLA [“Nick Blaine”] We shot Shell right before this final season. We'd been working together for quite some time and she was letting it slip as to what the direction of the season was going to be, and she was very excited about it. So I was clued in quite a long time before I even read the scripts.


TUCHMAN Max recognized it was a very honest look at his character, and that we're not trying to idealize or romanticize Nick anymore. To Max's credit, he really embraced everything.


MINGHELLA Nick was under tremendous pressure and when people are under pressure, they don't always think rationally. I think [when Nick told Wharton about the Jezebel's coup] that he assumed Wharton knew the answers already, and that it was a test more than an actual interrogation. I think Nick genuinely didn't anticipate what the consequences of that conversation were going to be, and I don't think he would have given those answers if he had known the implications.


BRUCE MILLER [creator, writer, executive producer] Nick meant a lot to June, but all the other things that he was were not really things that would connect with her. Max has been amazing at playing a character who is a citizen of Juneland. Nick doesn't really have loyalties anywhere else and that catches up to you in a place like Gilead. If you're not loyal to one side or the other, you're in danger from both sides.


TUCHMAN In The Handmaid's Tale book [by Margaret Atwood], I don't think Nick speaks. And in the pilot, he has very little to say. You get the vibe between him and June that there's something cooking, but going off of just that as an actor, you wouldn't know. It'd have to be a big leap of faith that the writers are going to do right by you. That's to Max's credit that he saw that from the beginning.

	











MINGHELLA It's bizarre how much I liked playing Nick. I don't think we're particularly similar, but I found him very comfortable to play. This is a very poignant way to end to me. I felt like a grounded version of Nick, and what I was really impressed by was how much it was not what I thought it was going to be. It's such a compliment to everybody who works on the show that they came up with something really inventive and still very much within the context of the show. I think the turn was in the decisions he made in that scene with [wife] Rose [in the hospital]. I looked at it as a morality play. The moment you make a psychological decision like that, the world will karmically punish you for it, certainly in the context of this story.


MOSS I feel like Nick was not the person June fell in love with. So as much as she can mourn the loss of the person she fell in love with, it won't trump the loss of the women [who were killed] at Jezebel's. But there is pain there, too. I'm not going to say there wasn't complexity to seeing him at that wedding and June not knowing what was going to happen to him next. Of course, there's a lot of complexity [seeing him step onto the plane].


MILLER I know it's controversial, but it felt inevitable that June was going to lose Nick this way. They're fighting on opposite sides and eventually, one of them is going to come upon the other at a time where they could die or sacrifice themselves. Gilead is a terrible, brutal, death-filled world, and there's a lot of loss. Part of Nick's backstory is that he was very involved in Gilead's version of January 6. He's considered one of the OG people who wasn't going to be forgiven by the U.S or Canadian governments. He put his lot in with those people.

	











CHANG There are certain things about Nick that June is blind to and that our viewers, and we as writers, are blind to because we're invested in this romance. For Nick to have risen to be part of the Gilead power regime — to be an Eye from the beginning, all the way through to becoming a Commander — he has done some bad things and we haven't shown them so it was convenient to forget. But one of the themes  this season, which you see with Wharton and Nick, is that there is no such thing as a good Gilead Commander. If you're a man who is powerful in Gilead, it means you are touched by some of that Gilead corruption.


MINGHELLA I'm only reading scripts I'm acting in, so I wasn't fully conscious of this more malevolent side to Nick. It was definitely a surprise reading how the show's perspective on him shifts so dramatically in season six. But I saw it as a way to explore a facet of this character that I haven't played yet, and that's a pretty interesting thing to get to do six seasons into a series. I'm working now on something that is incredibly consuming, so I've been healthfully distracted. But I hope more than anything people find the narrative overall to be satisfying. It's been a real labor of love for all of us. Everyone had the best intentions to deliver something that would be first and foremost unpredictable, and hopefully satisfying.


MOSS I do think Nick really loved Nichole [who is now going by her real name, Holly]. I think June will tell [her and Nick's daughter] all of the good things about her father. She'll tell him how much she loved him and how much he loved her. She'll tell him how much her parents loved each other and that ultimately, I think he would have done the right thing if he had gotten the chance to do it again.

	











MILLER June and Nick's relationship was amazing. I think their love was amazing, and so unexpected. And it almost saved Nick. He almost made it. June saw a really wonderful side of him, and that was a side we [the audience] saw almost all the time, but he was that guy from the beginning. He was a fucking driver. He was in the Eyes — he was the Gestapo. He's a survivor, but he's not much of a power player, and people like Nick get killed when they get to the top because other people want that power, whether it's Mayday or whether it's the other commanders allowing Mayday to blow that plane up. 


BRADLEY WHITFORD [“Joseph Lawrence”] I'm playing this guy who has done some really horrible things, but you could always tell a redeemable part of him was there. I also know that the show needs a villain, and I didn't know where this guy was gonna end up. But I was rooting for him to end up on the right side of history. This creative experience means a lot to me. This book means a lot to me. This unfortunate cultural relevance of the show means a lot to me. So there was a lot of anxiety. I've had so much luck in my career in not pestering writers, but I was so worried about it that I set up a meeting with Yahlin and Eric.


CHANG Bradley came to have lunch with the two of us [after season five]. He was concerned about what was going to happen to Lawrence. He really didn't want Lawrence to be evil. He didn't want him to descend into that for the finale season. We had already figured out what we were going to do with him and how he would die, and Bradley was relieved. He was so in from the moment Eric pitched it.

	











WHITFORD It was basically my fantasy of his trajectory. Because, it can't come too easy. This is not a show that needs a male savior (laughs). Lawrence is one of these intellectual guys and he was so excited about this idea of New Bethlehem that it sort of happened again where he got seduced by power and flattery. Even though he has contempt for these guys [the other High Commanders], his savior complex blinds him to what is a pretty obvious possibility, that those guys were gonna turn on him [which is why he decided to help Mayday].


TUCHMAN When you're going to kill off characters, you want them to go out with a bang. You want to have it land in a big way. Literally, in this case, Max and Bradley — and Josh Charles also explodes — all three of them have a very memorable end. 


MOSS With the final season, we were all [from Hulu and MGM to the executive producers] constantly making sure the show moved forward. Do we end in a different place than we began? Don't be stagnant. Keep going forward, because this is it. There's 10 episodes left to get to the end. No character this season ends in the same place that we begin.


WHITFORD So I knew what was going to happen, but I hadn't read it yet. We were shooting another scene and Lizzie said, “Do you wanna read it?” I said yes. But other people [on the cast] hadn't seen it yet. When they got the script, Ann Dowd left a very sweet message. She just thought it was beautiful.

	











TUCHMAN The moment when [Lawrence] turns to June when he's about to step on the plane, I scripted it as a little salute, which is nowhere near as moving as what Bradley did. That moment guts me every time. His expression, his gesture to her, is so emotional. Then to see the way he's sitting on that plane, knowing what's about to happen is powerful.


MOSS That was Brad's idea. The hand over the heart [really got me]. I mean, I've known Brad for 25 years. What matters absolutely the most to me is that the people I am working with feel like they are proud of what they're doing. That they're doing their best work. They're allowed to push themselves. That they have the space to do that and have a voice in the room, on both sides of the camera. That is truly what it's about. 


WARREN LITTLEFIELD [executive producer] The look as [Bradley is] getting onto the plane, it breaks your heart — and this is an architect of Gilead. Gilead does not come to life without Lawrence's brains, and now we have pain and anguish for the loss of this man. That's a remarkable journey. It's a tribute to everything the writers discovered and what Brad did, how he brought that character to life.


WHITFORD That [gesture was] one of those things where you don't know what's going to happen until you're doing it. I'd seen [the gesture] before. A friend of mine did that to a coffin of a loved one at a funeral and it was always a very moving thing to me. I also think it's an extension of what this experience with Lizzie has meant to me and the creative long-term bond I feel with that woman [starting with The West Wing]. That wasn't the last scene we shot, but it was getting there.

	











MINGHELLA It was really a blessed and wonderful way to finish, to have Lizzie directing my last scene in the show. It was fitting to finish with Brad, too.  We've become so close. I just adore him. I didn't know him before The Handmaid's Tale, and now I consider him one of my nearest and dearest friends. To do our last scene together was perfect.


WHITFORD The last scene we shot was on the plane. I felt off, because I was just dreading it. It meant a lot to me to be directed by Lizzie, sitting next to Max. Max is the dearest soul to me. These are both young people who really inspire me. I feel this kind of paternal ache with both of them who have been responsible for this very lucky older guy's incredible creative experience. The [Toronto] crew is the sweetest crew on the planet — despite whatever [President] Trump may think of Canadians — and I just didn't want to say goodbye. I know how rare it is. These shows are alchemy. I get emotional even talking about it.


	I was very happy that Lawrence made the choice that he made. I think as he's listening to Nick and sitting on the plane [in the final scene] he's thinking, “This poor kid is another victim of this hellscape that I created.”


LITTLEFIELD Finales are unbelievably difficult, because fans are passionate. You don't want to disappoint. Some really great shows have some not wonderful endings. But I feel very, very good about where we went this season and what we did with the final episode, and the new journey we're now on with [sequel series] The Testaments. Eric and Yahlin had to very carefully land this plane and allow us to take flight with The Testaments. That was a lot to navigate, but they did it.

Taylor Swift contributed “Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor's Version),” a re-recorded version of the hit single from her 2017 studio album, Reputation, to an episode of The Handmaid's Tale. The track appeared in the ninth episode of Season 6. Swift has not yet released the song online or on streaming services, nor has she announced the full album Reputation (Taylor's Version). The extensive airing of the track follows a preview on Wilderness back in 2023. Check out the longer cut on X.

“I've been wanting to use a Taylor song for many years on the show and we finally found the perfect spot for a track from her, and I'm so glad we waited because there could not be a more perfect song for a more perfect moment,” Elisabeth Moss, the lead star and executive producer of the series, told Billboard. “Taylor has been such an inspiration to me personally. As a Swiftie myself, and I think I can speak for [co-star] Yvonne [Strahovski] and our entire cast as well, who are all Swifties, it's such an honor to be able to use her music in the final episodes of our show.”

Featuring her singles “Look What You Made Me Do” and “...Ready for It?,” Reputation was Swift's fifth No. 1 album and her final release for Big Machine Records, which had issued all of her previous LPs. It earned Swift just one Grammy nomination, for Best Pop Vocal Album, but she ultimately lost to Ariana Grande and Sweetener. Swift recorded one part of Reputation with producer Jack Antonoff, but she did the bulk of it with Max Martin and Shellback. She also enlisted Future and Ed Sheeran for “End Game.”

So far, Swift has re-released four of her albums: Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version) arrived in 2021, while updates of Speak Now and 1989 were released in 2023. Swift began to re-record her pre-Lover material, in 2019, after Scooter Braun acquired her catalog by purchasing the Big Machine Label Group. In a 2022 interview with NPR, Braun said that he had “regrets” over how the deal panned out.

Between her re-recorded albums, Swift has continued to release new material, issuing her 10th original album, Midnights, in October 2022. Her 11th album, The Tortured Poets Department, followed in April 2024. She recently wrapped up her record-breaking Eras Tour, which spanned the globe and lasted multiple years.

As speculation continues to swirl around Kelly Clarkson's future with her daytime talk show, behind-the-scenes sources are reporting growing tension and emotional responses from longtime staff and crew members. For months, Clarkson has hinted at a possible shift for “The Kelly Clarkson Show.” Though she hasn't confirmed whether she plans to stay or leave, several are concerned about the outcome.

The 43-year-old singer sparked concern among fans last month after missing several episodes. Most notable was when Andy Cohen stepped in as a guest host. While Clarkson didn't publicly explain her absence, a source claimed she wanted to take time off to focus on her children, River and Remington. She reportedly also wanted to slow down her busy schedule after working nonstop for a while. Over the years, several celebrities, including Josh Groban, Willie Geist, Molly Sims, Wanda Sykes, and Roy Wood Jr., have filled in during her time away.

Now that her contract is set to expire in 2026, speculation about her next move has intensified. This especially after her May 9 concert in Atlantic City, where she addressed the crowd about the situation. Clarkson acknowledged the difficulty of balancing touring with her talk show duties.

“We haven't done a show in a while, y'all, 'cause I have a talk show. It's like a whole other job,” she told the audience. “We are bummed 'cause we love doing shows, and it's hard to fit it in, so it's cool when it does work out with the schedule and it's cool to get to see your faces and feed off y'all.”

While fans have expressed concern over the uncertainty, sources say staff members are feeling increasingly unsettled. This is due to the lack of clarity of the situation. According to a report from the Daily Mail, some team members feel betrayed, especially those who relocated from Los Angeles to New York City when the show moved production.

“Kelly Clarkson is ungrateful, and she fails to recognize how her staff uprooted their lives in Los Angeles and left their homes to relocate to New York because they believed in her and they loved working for her,” one insider claimed. The source added that several employees feel “disrespected” and “abandoned” due to the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Emmy-winning show's future.

According to The New York Post, an NBC insider revealed that Hoda Kotb, who was co-host of “Today”, is among the network's list of potential replacements should Clarkson decide to exit. “There's a long list of names and Hoda is part of that list,” the source stated. “NBC never wanted Hoda to leave. The question is: would Hoda want to do it?”

Despite the internal tension and growing speculation, Clarkson has yet to confirm or deny any plans to leave the show. For now, both her team and her fanbase remain in limbo. Several are hoping the beloved host will choose to extend her tenure. In the meantime, the “American Idol” alum remains busy, preparing to release her ninth studio album this June under her own label. She's also gearing up for a Las Vegas residency running July 4 through August 16, with additional shows scheduled from November 7 to 15.

"It's such an honor to be able to use her music in the final episodes of our show," Handmaid's star & EP Elisabeth Moss exclusively tells Billboard.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	Sorry, the old “Look What You Made Me Do” can't come to the phone right now. Why? ‘Cause the song has been fully updated and re-recorded ahead of Taylor Swift‘s upcoming Reputation (Taylor's Version), and it was featured almost in full in the latest episode of Hulu's The Handmaid's Tale.


	The song comes at the very beginning of the new episode, which opens with the handmaids staging an uprising led by June Osborne (Elisabeth Moss) against the Commanders. Soundtracked by the revamped version of the pop star's Reputation lead single — featuring re-creations of Jack Antonoff's original synths and thrumming drum beat, plus a new vocal take from an older, more experienced Swift — the women of the show remain stoic as they walk in formation, with June at one point barely escaping into the back of a truck as explosions go off behind her.

	











	Emmy-winning Handmaid's star and executive producer Elisabeth Moss tells Billboard in an exclusive statement that this musical moment has been a long time coming.

	“I've been wanting to use a Taylor song for many years on the show and we finally found the perfect spot for a track from her, and I'm so glad we waited because there could not be a more perfect song for a more perfect moment,” says Moss, who attended a Toronto stop of The Eras Tour alongside her Handmaid's co-star Bradley Whitford last year. “Taylor has been such an inspiration to me personally. As a Swiftie myself, and I think I can speak for [co-star] Yvonne [Strahovski] and our entire cast as well, who are all Swifties, it's such an honor to be able to use her music in the final episodes of our show.

A post shared by Amy Landecker (@amylandecker)


	“I said to my editor, Wendy, ‘I really want to find a place for a Taylor track in the last 2 episodes of the show' and we wanted to find a music queue for the opening of 9, and all the credit goes to Wendy for picking this track for this moment!”


	Emmy-winning Handmaid's Tale editor Wendy Hallam Martin said sometimes music synchs are just “meant to be,” as they agree this one was.


	“In trying many songs for this specific moment in our series and knowing how much Lizzie wanted a strong female voice and message, Taylor was really the artist that delivered both lyrically and tonally,” Hallam Martin tells Billboard in an exclusive statement. “Our badass main character June in this scene, really was saying ‘look what you made me do' and the song couldn't have been more on point. A perfect pairing. When I laid the song up against the scene, it just landed perfectly thematically, rhythmically and magically hit all the edit points which sometimes happens if it's meant to be. I shared it with Lizzie and we both knew immediately that this was the one!”

	











	Watch the opening scene of season 6, episode 9 of The Handmaid's Tale — and listen for the new version of “Look What You Made Me Do” — below.


	The feature marks one of the first tastes of Reputation (Taylor's Version) that Swifties have gotten — and it's a big one at that. The entire sequence includes the full first and second verses of “Look What You Made Me Do,” plus two choruses.


	Released in 2017, “Look What You Made Me Do” was the starting point for Swift's edgy Reputation era. The track spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, while the album topped the Billboard 200 for four weeks.


	Along with the 14-time Grammy winner's self-titled 2007 debut album, Reputation is just one of two LPs Swift has yet to re-record as part of her ongoing mission to reclaim the rights to her first six albums' masters. So far, all four of the re-recordings she has completed — Fearless (Taylor's Version), Red (Taylor's Version), Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version) — have debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. 


	This October will mark two years since Swift last dropped a Taylor's Version album, with the 1989 re-record, leaving fans antsy for the next one in the sequence. As far as Reputation (Taylor's Version) is concerned, the musician has only given out a few breadcrumbs so far; in March 2024, she shared a brief snippet of the revamped “Look What You Made Me Do” in an episode of Apple TV+'s The Dynasty: New England Patriots, just a few months after the track was featured in a teaser for Prime Video's Wilderness. In August 2023, she also contributed “Delicate (Taylor's Version)” to Prime Video's The Summer I Turned Pretty.

	











	Thanks to a string of possible clues on the pop star's website and social media accounts, however, a lot of Swifties are convinced that she's going to announce something — possibly a release date for Reputation (Taylor's Version) — at the American Music Awards on Memorial Day (May 26).

Scientists have discovered a new microbe never-before-seen on Earth inside China's Tiangong space station.

The new strain of bacteria, named Niallia tiangongensis after the space station, is a variant of a soil-dwelling terrestrial microbe that can cause sepsis, and was found inside one of the station's cabins.

Now, a new analysis of the strain has revealed that the bacterium isn't only one of a kind, but has also picked up some key adaptations that could be helpful in future space missions. The researchers published their findings March 3 in the journal International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology.

"Understanding the characteristics of microbes during long-term space missions is essential for safeguarding the health of astronauts and maintaining the functionality of spacecraft," the researchers wrote in the study.

The new strain was found in samples collected in 2023 by the crew of the Shenzhou-15 mission, who swabbed the space station's modules with sterile wipes before freezing them for transport.

After being sent back to Earth, analysis revealed that the bacteria was closely related to Niallia circulans, a rod-shaped, spore-propagating bacteria that typically dwells in soil, sewage and food, and can cause sepsis in immunocompromised patients.

However, the new strain had also picked up a few new adaptations to survive the harsh conditions of space. These include genes that code responses to oxidative stress, repair the bacteria from radiation damage, and enable it to form biofilms by breaking down gelatin to extract carbon and nitrogen.

It's not yet clear if the new strain could cause harm to humans, but the researchers hope that by studying it further they could learn more about how it, and others, survive; as well as the best ways to prevent human astronauts from any risks associated with space-adapted bugs.

This isn't the first microbe to have made the evolutionary leap to survive beyond our planet, either. In 2018, NASA scientists discovered four previously unknown strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria hiding inside the International Space Station's toilets, each with a suite of new adaptations to help them survive in outer space.

Shaquille O'Neal offered yet another layer to conspiracies regarding the legitimacy of the NBA Draft Lottery. O'Neal, whom the Orlando Magic selected with the No. 1 overall pick in the 1992 NBA Draft, recently raised eyebrows when he shared the details of a conversion between himself and then-NBA commissioner David Stern that occurred three months before that year's draft. 

"[Stern] says to me, 'Hey, can't wait for you to come to the NBA,'" O'Neal said on Ashley Nevel's podcast. "Then he pulled me off to the side. 'You want to play where it's cold or where it's hot?' He asked me that. Yeah, he did. He asked me that. And I was like, 'Hot.' And he smiled, and I smiled."

O'Neal ultimately got his wish, when Orlando won that year's lottery with Charlotte and Minnesota getting the second and third picks, respectively. 

While he didn't think much of it at the time, O'Neal is now somewhat skeptical when it comes to the NBA lottery and some of its outcomes over the years. 

"You hear a lot of these conspiracy theories, and there's a lot of situations that could make these things sound good and sound true," O'Neal said before making a reference to the Dallas Mavericks winning this year's lottery after they received a ton of heat from their fans after trading superstar guard Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers during the 2024-25 regular season. 

"It's very interesting how it all played out," O'Neal said about the Mavericks winning this year's lottery months after trading Dončić. 

By far, the biggest controversy regarding the lottery is the New York Knicks getting the No. 1 pick in the 1985 draft. With the pick, the Knicks selected center Patrick Ewing, who went onto enjoy a Hall of Fame career in New York. Ewing led the Knicks to the 1994 NBA Finals, but New York fell to the Houston Rockets in seven games. The Knicks never won a title with Ewing, but they do have a chance to snap their 26-year drought without an NBA Finals appearance if they can defeat historic rival Indiana in this year's Eastern Conference Finals. 

Speaking of O'Neal, he was the beneficiary of another controversial moment in NBA history, when his 2002 Lakers defeated the Sacramento Kings in the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers received several favorable calls during the series, especially in game six, a four-point win by Los Angeles that forced a game seven that O'Neal and Co. would ultimately win en route to their third straight NBA Finals triumph. 

As far as O'Neal's pre-draft conversation with Stern, it's a shame that Stern can't share his side of the story (he passed away in 2020). It's quite possible that Stern was simply making small talk with O'Neal, who is known to embellish stories. 

If his goal was to generate headlines, O'Neal has certainly done that. In the process, the Hall of Fame center has sparked another wave of questions and conversations regarding the NBA and its draft process.

The disappearance of 23-year-old Dail Dinwiddie from the Five Points area of downtown Columbia more than three decades ago remains one of South Carolina's most haunting – and enduring – cold cases. Her story is still seared into the public consciousness thanks to the tireless efforts of family and friends, investigators and detectives and members of the media who continue the search against ever-lengthening odds.

This army of devoted truth-seekers will never stop searching… nor will they ever give up hope that Dinwiddie might still be found. Perhaps even found alive.

More or less every Supernatural fan was drawn to the show thanks to the performances of Jared Palecki as Sam and Jensen Ackles as Dean. The pair are beyond synonymous with the series, and both have professed to being fans themselves, including having their own picks for best episode. Jared Padalecki's favorite Supernatural episode isn't just a fan-favorite or a clever detour - it's one of the greatest hours of TV the series ever produced. The actor revealed his pick after the show wrapped, and as someone who's watched the Winchesters battle everything from Lucifer to Leviathans, I can confidently say his choice is spot on.

Of course, Supernatural had no shortage of standout episodes. From heartbreaking character deaths to world-ending stakes, the show knew how to keep fans coming back. But it was also fearless in breaking the fourth wall, poking fun at itself, and letting its stars play in totally unexpected ways. Jared Padalecki's favorite Supernatural episode is one of those moments - a bold, hilarious, and surprisingly meta story that turned the show's universe upside down. It's an episode that only Supernatural could have pulled off, and one that cemented its place as a genre series that never took itself too seriously. This episode is, of course, season 6's “The French Mistake.”

In a 2016 interview with EW, Jared Padalecki finally revealed what many Supernatural fans had long speculated - that “The French Mistake” was his favorite episode of the entire series. That's saying something, considering Padalecki appeared in over 300 episodes and experienced nearly every high and low the show had to offer. However, “The French Mistake” wasn't just another case of monster-hunting for Sam and Dean Winchester. It was a total reality-bending twist that saw the brothers catapulted into a world where Supernatural is a TV show, and they're actors named Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles.

Jared Padalecki's choice makes perfect sense when you rewatch the episode with that in mind. “The French Mistake” gave the cast and crew a rare chance to completely shake off the show's usual stakes and structure. In doing so, they got to parody themselves, the entertainment industry, and even the absurdity of a series like Supernatural being filmed in the first place. Padalecki hilariously played an exaggerated version of himself - complete with lavish home, a very vocal love of alpacas, and a not-so-great reputation among the “crew.” It's a rare kind of comedic performance, and he clearly relished the opportunity to poke fun at his own image.

 What's interesting, though, is that “The French Mistake” isn't the only episode Padalecki holds close. In a later interview (again with EW), he reflected on how the Supernatural series finale also ranks among his favorites, largely because of its emotional weight and personal significance. After all, saying goodbye to Sam Winchester after fifteen years wasn't easy, and the finale gave him (and fans) a meaningful sendoff. 

Still, while the Supernatural finale was poignant, “The French Mistake” was pure creative chaos - and arguably a more daring example of what the show could achieve when it let loose. Jared Padalecki's favorite Supernatural episode reveals something crucial about the actor's relationship to the series: he loved when it took chances. “The French Mistake” wasn't just funny or self-aware - it was a perfect encapsulation of Supernatural's ability to reinvent itself. That, more than any monster or myth, is why it remains unforgettable.

“The French Mistake” is everything that makes Supernatural great wrapped into one gloriously bizarre hour of television. The episode begins with the archangel Raphael threatening Castiel, who sends Sam and Dean to an alternate universe as a way to keep them safe. However, this isn't just any alternate universe - it's our world, where Supernatural is a TV show, and Sam and Dean are actors Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles. What follows is a brilliant, off-the-wall meta adventure where the Winchesters are forced to navigate craft services, stunt rehearsals, and awkward celebrity interviews.

There's something deeply refreshing about seeing a show that's willing to take a hammer to its own mythology. 

What makes “The French Mistake” so brilliant isn't just the clever writing - it's how fully committed the episode is to the bit. From Dean's horrified reaction to his “fake” life to Sam trying (and failing) to act like Jared Padalecki, every scene is loaded with visual gags, absurdity, and inside jokes. The show even ropes in series creator Eric Kripke, executive producer Bob Singer, and real crew members as fictionalized versions of themselves, poking fun at the entertainment machine that made Supernatural a global success.

There's something deeply refreshing about seeing a show that's willing to take a hammer to its own mythology. At this point in season 6, Supernatural had already gone to hell and back - literally. “The French Mistake” hits pause on all that and reminds us why we fell in love with the series in the first place: its willingness to be weird, wild, and wildly self-deprecating. The jokes come fast, the pacing is sharp, and the performances are on another level. Jared Padalecki's favorite Supernatural episode earns that title because it balances pure comedy with real love for the show's legacy.

Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles played the Winchester brothers for 15 seasons of Supernatural, and here are their favorite episodes, explained.

Jared Palecki's favorite Supernatural episode also gave fans a look behind the curtain (sort of). While the version of Hollywood presented in “The French Mistake” is exaggerated, it's also filled with Easter eggs and inside references that longtime fans ate up. From fake Twitter beefs to producer cameos, this was an episode made for the fandom. While it could've easily gone off the rails, it's executed with such precision that it feels like the show operating at its peak.

While Supernatural was built on a solid formula (salt, burn, repeat) some of its best episodes came when it broke away from that structure entirely. Episodes like “Mystery Spot,” “Changing Channels,” and of course, “The French Mistake” are beloved not just because they're funny or strange, but because they remind fans how flexible and fearless the show could be. When Supernatural leaned into its own weirdness, it created some of the most memorable television of its fifteen-season run.

Jared Padalecki's favorite Supernatural episode is a perfect example of how the show embraced experimentation. “The French Mistake” wasn't just a funny diversion - it was a love letter to the show's cast, crew, and fans. It wasn't the only one, either. For example, season 5's “Changing Channels” had Sam and Dean trapped in parodies of popular TV genres, from soap operas to sitcoms, while season 3's “Mystery Spot” delivered a time-loop twist that was equal parts heartbreaking and hilarious. These episodes worked not just because they were clever, but because they stayed true to the characters even while tossing them into absurd situations.

That balance of the surreal and the sincere is what made these outlier episodes of Supernatural feel so essential. They gave the audience a breather from the apocalypse-of-the-week and showed that Supernatural was always more than just a horror series. It was a show about two brothers who could survive anything - even the fourth wall.

Home - News - The first extraterrestrial species: an unknown strain of bacteria discovered on the Chinese space station

Oleksandr Fedotkin

Author of news and articles

Chinese scientists have discovered in samples from the Tiangong space station a previously unknown strain of bacteria that has successfully adapted to existence in extreme conditions microgravity and radiation.

The microorganisms have already been named Niallia tiangongensis and are probably an unknown relative of the terrestrial bacterium Niallia circulans — a rod-shaped, soil bacterium. These bacterial species are able to survive in extreme conditions with the help of resistant spores. It is currently unknown whether Niallia tiangongensis evolved once in space or had all its unusual properties when it arrived at the station as a spore.

A detailed metabolic analysis and genome sequencing revealed that Niallia tiangongensis DNA contains sequences that are not found in similar organisms on Earth. These are bacteria are able to break down gelatin to produce nitrogen and carbon, which microorganisms use to form a layer of protective biofilm to protect themselves in extreme conditions.

New bacteria were discovered during a routine microbiological study of air filters in the Tianhe module in May 2023. The collected samples were sent back to Earth. Niallia tiangongensis demonstrated 200 times higher resistance to radiation than their Earthly relatives. They also successfully adapted to reproduction in microgravity and proved to be resistant to oxidative stress. Niallia tiangongensis can survive for a long time in extremely low temperatures and even in a vacuum.

These microorganisms can absorb cosmic radiation, using it as a source of energy. They have a special cell membrane structure that protects them from extreme temperatures and a unique DNA repair mechanism that prevents mutations.

Currently, these bacteria are of great interest to scientists not only because of their unique properties, which can be used in medicine, but also in agriculture and space. There are concerns about the biological safety of space missions, as some representatives of this species can cause sepsis in people with weakened immune systems.

The Dybbuk box - also known as 'the world's most haunted object' - is said to have cursed beloved singer Post Malone back in 2018. 

The chilling artifact is currently kept under lock and key at a haunted museum in Las Vegas run by Ghost Adventures' paranormal investigator Zak Bagans. 

It appears on the surface to be nothing more than a vintage wine cabinet but inside it is said to hold a dybbuk - an evil spirit that can invade and possess a living person, per US Ghost Adventures.

The object has become so recognizable that it even inspired the popular 2012 horror film The Possession.

During the Ghost Adventurers' New York ComicCon panel, Bagans described Malone's visit to the museum in June 2018.

The ghost hunter said that during the spooky tour, he and the singer, now 29, decided to go into the room with the box before removing the protective case.

'It is a very powerful item,' Bagans, 48, said, per People.

'I didn't want to open it, I just wanted to take the case off. 

'To make a long story short, we began hearing things.' 

The pair soon began hearing what sounded like a 'little girl's voice' and Bagan said Malone initially sprinted down the stairs to get away from the exhibit.

But eventually, upon returning to the room, Bagans said that still 'something wasn't right.' 

'I remember putting my hand on the box and at that exact moment, Post put his hand on my shoulder,' Bagans recalled. 

'At that moment, it was like something came through the box and into him, and I began shaking, I began trembling. 

'This is kind of embarrassing, I began crying, I began screaming, and this is when he got me out of the room forcefully.'

In the aftermath, Malone claimed to see a dark shadowy figure lingering outside.

And, the next day, the singer allegedly sent Bagan an eerie photo of a massive bruise on his arm. 

'Mind you, Post is a person we've investigated with, he's a great debunker - very, very smart,' Bagans said.

In Jewish Folklore, a dybbuk is a disembodied human spirit - due to past sins - that wanders restlessly until it can feel safe again in the body of a human person. 

The word 'dybbuk' came from the Hebrew root 'davek,' which means to cling or to cleave.

The box initially appeared in 2003 when Kevin Mannis, an antique store owner, bought a vintage wine box from a 103-year-old Holocaust survivor on eBay, per US Ghost Adventures.

After a string of suspicious hauntings, the box was placed back on the site and bought by a man named Jason Haxton.

He eventually also felt the horrors of the box and buried it in Missouri before sharing it on Bagan's show.

Annabelle arrived at Black Swan Inn, a notoriously haunted location in San Antonio. Her appearance is part of this weekend's Psychic and Spirit Fest, drawing in curious thrill-seekers and paranormal enthusiasts.

The infamous haunted doll Annabelle has resurfaced, and this time, she's made her way to San Antonio, Texas, igniting online buzz and local curiosity. Annabelle's chilling tale dates back to the 1970s when she was gifted to a Hartford nursing student. What started as a sweet gesture quickly turned sinister. The student and her roommates reported unexplained movements and strange behaviour from the doll. Things escalated when the fiancé of one of the roommates was allegedly attacked. That's when famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren intervened. After conducting an exorcism, the Warrens claimed the doll was being manipulated by a demonic entity and took her into their custody. Since then, Annabelle has become a staple of supernatural lore, made infamous through The Conjuring Universe films and the Warrens' Occult Museum in Monroe, Connecticut.

In May 2025, Annabelle was taken on the road as part of the “Devils on the Run Tour,” a travelling exhibit organised by paranormal investigator Ryan Daniel Buell, formerly of Paranormal State. Buell has been documenting Annabelle's journey across the U.S. on TikTok, capturing millions of views and thousands of comments, many expressing fear, scepticism, and superstition.

On Friday morning, Annabelle arrived at Black Swan Inn, a notoriously haunted location in San Antonio. Her appearance is part of this weekend's Psychic and Spirit Fest, drawing in curious thrill-seekers and paranormal enthusiasts.

Annabelle's presence may seem like harmless fun, but eerie events are being reported. Locals near the Black Swan Inn claim to have experienced power outages, unusual animal behaviour, and strange noises since the doll arrived. One TikTok user, Laurie Boudreaux, shared that her sister's home, believed to be the former residence of voodoo queen Marie Laveau in New Orleans, caught fire unexpectedly. The timing has led many to draw paranormal connections.

Rumours have swirled online about 11 inmates escaping from a local jail shortly after the doll reached Texas. Though unverified, the coincidence has only added to Annabelle's mystique.

A new satellite photo has revealed that the "megaberg," A23a, is beginning to break apart, spawning thousands of smaller ice chunks around the Antarctic island of South Georgia.

Where is it? Scotia Sea, South Atlantic Ocean [-54.4957805, -37.7561759]

What's in the photo? Iceberg A23a, which is beginning to break apart alongside South Georgia island

Which satellite took the photo? NASA's Aqua satellite

When was it taken? May 3, 2025

A striking new satellite photo has revealed that the world's largest iceberg is starting to break apart into thousands of smaller pieces as it remains stuck alongside a wildlife refuge in Antarctica. But it could take months, if not years, for the entire slab to disappear.

The "megaberg," dubbed A23a, currently has a surface area of around 1,200 square miles (3,100 square kilometers) — roughly the size of Long Island. It first calved off of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in 1986, but it became trapped when its underside caught on the seafloor. It remained stranded until January 2023, when it finally began to move away from mainland Antarctica. During this time, it has repeatedly held the title of "world's largest iceberg" as bigger bergs have come and gone, most recently regaining the title in June 2023.

The giant iceberg became trapped again in early 2024 after getting caught in a large ocean vortex. It remained spinning on the spot for several months before eventually breaking free in December 2024 and resuming its journey north through the Drake Passage — also known as the "iceberg graveyard," where large Antarctic icebergs get swept away to their eventual doom.

But in January, it became clear that A23a was on a collision course with South Georgia in the Scotia Sea. By March, the megaberg came to a halt as it grounded on the seafloor around 60 miles (100 kilometers) off the island's southwest coast, where it became trapped for the third — and likely final — time in its lengthy lifespan.

Now, photos from NASA's Aqua satellite have revealed that the edges of A23a are starting to disintegrate, especially along its northern edge, blanketing the surrounding area with icy debris, according to NASA's Earth Observatory. "Thousands of iceberg pieces litter the ocean surface near the main berg, creating a scene reminiscent of a dark starry night," NASA representatives wrote.

The numerous new icebergs appear extremely small compared with A23a. However, "many measure at least a kilometer across and would pose a risk to ships," NASA representatives wrote. The largest piece to break off from the megaberg, which has been dubbed A23c, has an area of around 50 square miles (130 square km) and is currently drifting south (just out of the satellite photo).

This type of iceberg disintegration is known as "edge wasting" and has shrunk A23a by around 200 square miles (520 square km) since it became stuck in March, according to NASA. At this rate, it will likely take several months, if not years, for the berg to fully break apart, assuming larger cracks do not rip it apart first.

However, A23a may not hold its size title for long, because as of May 16, it is only around 12 square miles (31 square km) larger than the next-biggest iceberg, D15A, according to the U.S. National Ice Center.

South Georgia is not inhabited by people, aside from a few dozen researchers who visit throughout the year. However, it is home to an abundance of wildlife, such as seals and seabirds, including more than 2 million penguins, according to BirdLife International.

Having a large iceberg moored just offshore can be problematic for these species, especially for penguins that may have to travel several hundred extra miles around the obstruction to reach their prey, depending on where the iceberg is located. Meltwater coming from trapped bergs can also alter the temperature and salinity of their surroundings.



It is currently unclear how much of an impact A23a is having on the local wildlife. However, the iceberg is quite far off the coast, meaning it will be less disruptive than it could have been. Some researchers have claimed the melting slab could benefit the marine ecosystem by releasing nutrients into the ocean.

This is not the first time that South Georgia has been put under siege by giant icebergs. In 2020, one of the world's previous largest icebergs, A68, became stuck even closer to the island, sparking fears that it could disrupt penguin colonies. However, unlike A23a, it quickly broke up into dozens of sizable chunks after ocean currents ripped it in half, causing it to quickly melt away and thus averting disaster.

As human-caused climate change continues to cause increased melting of Antarctica's ice sheets, many more hefty bergs could soon pass by South Georgia in the coming decades.

The range of reactions to his prostate cancer revelation reflects today's harsh political environment, as well as revived discussions about Biden's health as he sought a second term.

When a former president receives a serious medical diagnosis, the traditional response has been to set aside political differences, offer warm praise and wish the individual a speedy recovery and complete return to health.

In many cases, that's exactly what happened Sunday after former president Joe Biden disclosed that he has an aggressive form of prostate cancer. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Biden since taking office, wished Biden “a fast and successful recovery.”

But in a reflection of today's harsh political environment and reignited questions over Biden's health during his reelection campaign and his inner circle's handling of the situation, some Republicans and right-wing activists wasted little time asserting, without evidence, that Biden and his circle covered up the diagnosis.

Trump, speaking in the Oval Office on Monday, said the diagnosis was “very sad, actually” and that he felt “badly about it.” But he also questioned why it wasn't caught earlier.

“That test is standard to pretty much anybody getting a physical, a good physical,” he said. “We had the doctors at the White House and over at Walter Reed, which is a fantastic hospital. I do it — I did a very complete physical, including cognitive tests.”

Trump inaccurately referred to Biden's diagnosis as “stage 9,” an apparent reference to a pathology report giving his cancer a Gleason score of 9 on a scale that rises to 10 and indicates an aggressive cancer. Trump also questioned Biden's cognitive ability.

“If you take a look, it's the same doctor that said that Joe was cognitively fine, there was nothing wrong with him,” Trump said. “If it's the same doctor who said there was nothing wrong there, that's being proven to be a sad situation. … The doctor said he's just fine. And it's turned out that's not so. It's very dangerous.”

“Unbelievable this was missed, but the truth is, his physician was more concerned about assisting with the political cover up than providing world class medical care,” Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas) posted on social media Sunday night.

Jackson was himself White House physician to President Barack Obama as well as Trump. He drew attention in 2018 for an effusive report on Trump's condition, saying the president had done “exceedingly well” on a cognitive exam and had “incredible genes.”

The varying messages emerged as Biden thanked Americans on Monday for their “love and support.”

“Cancer touches us all,” Biden wrote on X in his first public comment about the diagnosis. “Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places. Thank you for lifting us up with love and support.”

Biden shared a picture of himself seated with former first lady Jill Biden and their cat, Willow.

His cancer diagnosis renewed debate about who should receive annual screenings, and at what age, for signs of the disease. Prostate cancer specialists told The Washington Post that it is not unusual for someone Biden's age to skip screening for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which, when elevated, can indicate a higher risk of prostate cancer.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which makes medical recommendations about preventive services such as screenings, explicitly recommends against PSA screening in men 70 years and older. For men ages 55 to 69, the decision should be an individual one, it says. The guidelines note that “many men will experience potential harms of screening, including false-positive results that require additional testing and possible prostate biopsy; overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction.”

Biden's prognosis depends on many factors that are not known publicly, said William Dahut, chief scientific officer of the American Cancer Society. That includes the degree to which the cancer has spread into the bones and whether it has reached organs such as the liver, Dahut said.

Ezekiel J. Emanuel, an oncologist and professor at the University of Pennsylvania who served on a covid-19 advisory board for Biden, said on MSNBC on Monday that Biden “probably” had the cancer “at the start of his presidency in 2021” because the former president “did not develop it in the last 100, 200 days.” Emanuel said later in an interview with The Post that the point he was trying to make is that the kind of cancer Biden had was “present” during his time in office “because this kind of cancer doesn't develop overnight.”

“I didn't say that there was a conspiracy,” Emanuel said. “I was very clear that he did have cancer, that's a fact. That he knew or didn't know, I don't know and they don't know.” Emanuel added that he “should have” clarified that his point “doesn't mean the president knew” he had cancer.

Oncologists specializing in prostate cancer said even aggressive cancers can appear suddenly or without symptoms. “It's certainly possible for more aggressive, advanced cancers to develop in a setting with low PSA, or develop and spread rather quickly, on the order of less than a year,” said Jason Efstathiou, a prostate radiation oncologist at Mass General Brigham.

Biden's life and political career has been defined by both tragedy and triumph — his longtime aide and confidant Ted Kaufman has often described him as “the luckiest and the unluckiest person I've met” — and the news on Sunday reverberated around the universe of former Biden aides.

“The first thing he wanted to know when I was diagnosed was, ‘Was I happy with my doctors? Was I getting the advice I needed?'” said TJ Ducklo, a Biden aide who during the 2020 presidential campaign was treated for Stage 4 lung cancer. “He right away jumps at that.”

Many of the responses Sunday and Monday, from Republicans and Democrats alike, were in a supportive vein. “This is certainly sad news, and the Johnson family will be joining the countless others who are praying for the former president in the wake of his diagnosis,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) posted on Sunday night.

But some took a different tone.

Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, posted an accusatory message just hours after Biden's diagnosis became public suggesting the Biden family hid his condition. “What I want to know is how did Dr. Jill Biden miss stage five metastatic cancer or is this yet another coverup???” he wrote.

Former first lady Jill Biden has a doctorate in education but is not a medical doctor. Trump's supporters often mocked her for using the honorific when the Bidens were in the White House.

Some of the criticism has focused on Biden's last medical report as president, in February 2024, when his physician declared Biden in good health and cited no prostate issues. Some conservatives say that exam should have picked up Biden's cancer, so either it wasn't performed or the White House is covering it up.

“Is Team Biden accusing the WH physician of malpractice? Or just lying? Again,” conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wrote on social media.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday reiterated Trump's supportive comments about Biden from Sunday night. She said that the two men had not spoken, but that Trump “would be open to doing that.”

Asked whether Trump was concerned about the quality of the White House physicians and whether they should have caught the diagnosis sooner, she said, “Not as far as President Trump is concerned. The White House physician we have here is phenomenal.”

“To the best of my understanding,” Leavitt added, Trump, who is 78, is regularly screened for prostate cancer in his medical evaluations. His latest report, released in April, included a Prostate-Specific Antigen level of 0.10 ng/mL, well below any levels indicating a prostate cancer risk.

For years, Trump and some of his prominent allies have been quick to embrace and spread conspiracy theories about political opponents, giving them a particular resonance with his supporters, said Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami.

“People who have a conspiratorial worldview or who don't like Biden for whatever reason will not trust information about Biden, and they will come up with their own explanations,” said Uscinski, who studies conspiracy theories.

But the situation has been complicated by renewed accusations that Biden's team covered up his cognitive decline as he pushed ahead with reelection. That charge is leveled in several new books, including “Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again” by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson.

“Original Sin” is scheduled to publish Tuesday — but now it will appear in a suddenly altered landscape.

The last few days have amounted to a striking sequence of events for the 82-year-old Biden, who is in the twilight of a long career after ceding the White House four months ago to a rival whose ouster was his stated reason for running for president.

Biden received the diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer on Friday, his office said. That evening, Axios published an excerpt from Biden's 2023 interview with special counsel Robert K. Hur, in which Biden speaks haltingly, including a digression about Beau's death.

“In 2017, Beau had passed and … this is personal …” Biden can be heard saying. “I know you're all close with your sons and daughters, but Beau was like my right arm, and Hunter was my left.” Hunter is Biden's younger son.

Biden's office announced his diagnosis on Sunday night, saying it “represents a more aggressive form” of cancer but that it appears to be sensitive to hormone therapy, allowing “for effective management.”

Some Republicans on Monday were trying to find a balance between wishing Biden well and continuing their attacks on his party. Vice President JD Vance said he wished Biden “the best” of health, but argued it was still fair to question whether his advisers hid his condition.

“Whether the right time to have this conversation is now or at some point in the future, we really do need to be honest about whether the former president was capable of doing the job,” Vance told reporters aboard Air Force Two.

“You can separate the desire for him to have the right health outcome with a recognition that whether it was doctors or whether there were staffers … I don't think he was able to do a good job for the American people,” he added.

A UFO has struck and damaged a US military jet near an Arizona Air Force training range.

The base is no stranger to UFO sightings, but a January 2023 incident saw a mystery object smack right into the cockpit canopy of a $63 million F-16 Viper, causing damage and grounding the fighter, as per Federal Aviation Administration documents first reported by the War Zone.

These papers describe the culprit as "an orange-white UAS," or "uncrewed aerial system," a term typically used for drones. That very day, three more run-ins with these UAS were reported.

Ex-Pentagon investigator Luis Elizondo spoke to News Nation recently, saying: "What I can tell you is that there has been a lot of activity, a lot of people reporting a lot of things out of Arizona, particularly on the border" with Mexico.

The FAA said it "documents Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) sightings whenever a pilot reports one to an air traffic control facility."

They added: "If supporting information such as radar data corroborates the report, the FAA shares it with the UAP Task Force. The Department of Defense All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office serves as the centralized clearing house for UAP reporting impacting national security or safety."

Unidentified flying objects, known to travel in groups of up to eight, have been spotted darting across the Arizona skies, particularly near military air combat training sites. These sightings have been reported since January 2020.

A whopping 757 similar incidents were recorded between May 2023 and June 2024, according to the Anomaly Resolution Office. Of these, 708 remain unresolved, with only 49 cases marked as "Case closed".

Following the 2023 Chinese spy balloon incident, procedures for dealing with such events have been significantly tightened. UFOs are now "clearly being passed through multiple U.S. military reporting streams," as per War Zone.

Ron Vitiello, a senior adviser for US Customs and Border Protection, has speculated that these enigmatic drones could be tools used by foreign cartels for espionage or smuggling operations. After all, drones have been known to transport up to 10 kilos of drugs at a time for cartels.

In a recent chat with "News Nation Prime", Vitiello suggested that cartels, with their seemingly "unlimited funding", might be using advanced technology not yet seen before.

"Maybe they've got technology that we're not used to seeing in the drone space," Vitiello mused. "That's part of their business model, to always be able to iterate and innovate, so that they can continue to sell their poison into the United States."
