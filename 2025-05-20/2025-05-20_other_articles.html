When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Scientists have discovered a new microbe never-before-seen on Earth inside China's Tiangong space station. The new strain of bacteria, named Niallia tiangongensis after the space station, is a variant of a soil-dwelling terrestrial microbe that can cause sepsis, and was found inside one of the station's cabins. Now, a new analysis of the strain has revealed that the bacterium isn't only one of a kind, but has also picked up some key adaptations that could be helpful in future space missions. Related: Purple bacteria could be key to finding extraterrestrial life on exoplanets After being sent back to Earth, analysis revealed that the bacteria was closely related to Niallia circulans, a rod-shaped, spore-propagating bacteria that typically dwells in soil, sewage and food, and can cause sepsis in immunocompromised patients.

However, the new strain had also picked up a few new adaptations to survive the harsh conditions of space. It's not yet clear if the new strain could cause harm to humans, but the researchers hope that by studying it further they could learn more about how it, and others, survive; as well as the best ways to prevent human astronauts from any risks associated with space-adapted bugs. In 2018, NASA scientists discovered four previously unknown strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria hiding inside the International Space Station's toilets, each with a suite of new adaptations to help them survive in outer space.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Shaquille O'Neal offered yet another layer to conspiracies regarding the legitimacy of the NBA Draft Lottery. 1 overall pick in the 1992 NBA Draft, recently raised eyebrows when he shared the details of a conversion between himself and then-NBA commissioner David Stern that occurred three months before that year's draft. "[Stern] says to me, 'Hey, can't wait for you to come to the NBA,'" O'Neal said on Ashley Nevel's podcast. "Then he pulled me off to the side. O'Neal ultimately got his wish, when Orlando won that year's lottery with Charlotte and Minnesota getting the second and third picks, respectively. While he didn't think much of it at the time, O'Neal is now somewhat skeptical when it comes to the NBA lottery and some of its outcomes over the years. "You hear a lot of these conspiracy theories, and there's a lot of situations that could make these things sound good and sound true," O'Neal said before making a reference to the Dallas Mavericks winning this year's lottery after they received a ton of heat from their fans after trading superstar guard Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers during the 2024-25 regular season. "It's very interesting how it all played out," O'Neal said about the Mavericks winning this year's lottery months after trading Dončić. With the pick, the Knicks selected center Patrick Ewing, who went onto enjoy a Hall of Fame career in New York. The Knicks never won a title with Ewing, but they do have a chance to snap their 26-year drought without an NBA Finals appearance if they can defeat historic rival Indiana in this year's Eastern Conference Finals. Speaking of O'Neal, he was the beneficiary of another controversial moment in NBA history, when his 2002 Lakers defeated the Sacramento Kings in the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers received several favorable calls during the series, especially in game six, a four-point win by Los Angeles that forced a game seven that O'Neal and Co. would ultimately win en route to their third straight NBA Finals triumph. As far as O'Neal's pre-draft conversation with Stern, it's a shame that Stern can't share his side of the story (he passed away in 2020). It's quite possible that Stern was simply making small talk with O'Neal, who is known to embellish stories. If his goal was to generate headlines, O'Neal has certainly done that. In the process, the Hall of Fame center has sparked another wave of questions and conversations regarding the NBA and its draft process.

The disappearance of 23-year-old Dail Dinwiddie from the Five Points area of downtown Columbia more than three decades ago remains one of South Carolina's most haunting – and enduring – cold cases. Her story is still seared into the public consciousness thanks to the tireless efforts of family and friends, investigators and detectives and members of the media who continue the search against ever-lengthening odds.

This army of devoted truth-seekers will never stop searching… nor will they ever give up hope that Dinwiddie might still be found. Perhaps even found alive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More or less every Supernatural fan was drawn to the show thanks to the performances of Jared Palecki as Sam and Jensen Ackles as Dean. The pair are beyond synonymous with the series, and both have professed to being fans themselves, including having their own picks for best episode. Jared Padalecki's favorite Supernatural episode isn't just a fan-favorite or a clever detour - it's one of the greatest hours of TV the series ever produced. But it was also fearless in breaking the fourth wall, poking fun at itself, and letting its stars play in totally unexpected ways. Jared Padalecki's favorite Supernatural episode is one of those moments - a bold, hilarious, and surprisingly meta story that turned the show's universe upside down. This episode is, of course, season 6's “The French Mistake.” In a 2016 interview with EW, Jared Padalecki finally revealed what many Supernatural fans had long speculated - that “The French Mistake” was his favorite episode of the entire series. However, “The French Mistake” wasn't just another case of monster-hunting for Sam and Dean Winchester. Jared Padalecki's choice makes perfect sense when you rewatch the episode with that in mind. Padalecki hilariously played an exaggerated version of himself - complete with lavish home, a very vocal love of alpacas, and a not-so-great reputation among the “crew.” It's a rare kind of comedic performance, and he clearly relished the opportunity to poke fun at his own image. In a later interview (again with EW), he reflected on how the Supernatural series finale also ranks among his favorites, largely because of its emotional weight and personal significance. After all, saying goodbye to Sam Winchester after fifteen years wasn't easy, and the finale gave him (and fans) a meaningful sendoff. That, more than any monster or myth, is why it remains unforgettable. “The French Mistake” is everything that makes Supernatural great wrapped into one gloriously bizarre hour of television. The episode begins with the archangel Raphael threatening Castiel, who sends Sam and Dean to an alternate universe as a way to keep them safe. What follows is a brilliant, off-the-wall meta adventure where the Winchesters are forced to navigate craft services, stunt rehearsals, and awkward celebrity interviews. The show even ropes in series creator Eric Kripke, executive producer Bob Singer, and real crew members as fictionalized versions of themselves, poking fun at the entertainment machine that made Supernatural a global success. At this point in season 6, Supernatural had already gone to hell and back - literally. Jared Padalecki's favorite Supernatural episode earns that title because it balances pure comedy with real love for the show's legacy. Jared Palecki's favorite Supernatural episode also gave fans a look behind the curtain (sort of). While the version of Hollywood presented in “The French Mistake” is exaggerated, it's also filled with Easter eggs and inside references that longtime fans ate up. From fake Twitter beefs to producer cameos, this was an episode made for the fandom. While Supernatural was built on a solid formula (salt, burn, repeat) some of its best episodes came when it broke away from that structure entirely. Episodes like “Mystery Spot,” “Changing Channels,” and of course, “The French Mistake” are beloved not just because they're funny or strange, but because they remind fans how flexible and fearless the show could be. Jared Padalecki's favorite Supernatural episode is a perfect example of how the show embraced experimentation. “The French Mistake” wasn't just a funny diversion - it was a love letter to the show's cast, crew, and fans. For example, season 5's “Changing Channels” had Sam and Dean trapped in parodies of popular TV genres, from soap operas to sitcoms, while season 3's “Mystery Spot” delivered a time-loop twist that was equal parts heartbreaking and hilarious. These episodes worked not just because they were clever, but because they stayed true to the characters even while tossing them into absurd situations. They gave the audience a breather from the apocalypse-of-the-week and showed that Supernatural was always more than just a horror series. It was a show about two brothers who could survive anything - even the fourth wall. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. There is a simple explanation for Power Rangers' most infamous mystery, and it reveals a major problem with the TV show that I hope the reboot fixes. HIMYM was a truly unique sitcom, but this 3-season ABC show hits all the same notes. Not every K-drama is right for beginners, and if I wanted to get someone into that world, certain shows would be at the top of my recommendation list. Three years after working together in Goblin, Lee Dong-wook and Yoo In-na collaborated in another romantic K-drama, this time as the lead couple. The Wire's season 5 storyline of a made-up serial killer was criticized for being too far-fetched, but there's still a lot to love about it. Niles and Frasier's witty one-liners are Frasier's most recognizable comedy trope, but the show knew exactly when and how to subvert it. I respect Lost as one of television's most important and entertaining shows of all time, and I now respect it even more for avoiding a modern trend.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chinese scientists have discovered in samples from the Tiangong space station a previously unknown strain of bacteria that has successfully adapted to existence in extreme conditions microgravity and radiation. The microorganisms have already been named Niallia tiangongensis and are probably an unknown relative of the terrestrial bacterium Niallia circulans — a rod-shaped, soil bacterium. These bacterial species are able to survive in extreme conditions with the help of resistant spores. It is currently unknown whether Niallia tiangongensis evolved once in space or had all its unusual properties when it arrived at the station as a spore. Niallia tiangongensis demonstrated 200 times higher resistance to radiation than their Earthly relatives. These microorganisms can absorb cosmic radiation, using it as a source of energy. Currently, these bacteria are of great interest to scientists not only because of their unique properties, which can be used in medicine, but also in agriculture and space. There are concerns about the biological safety of space missions, as some representatives of this species can cause sepsis in people with weakened immune systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Dybbuk box - also known as 'the world's most haunted object' - is said to have cursed beloved singer Post Malone back in 2018. The chilling artifact is currently kept under lock and key at a haunted museum in Las Vegas run by Ghost Adventures' paranormal investigator Zak Bagans. It appears on the surface to be nothing more than a vintage wine cabinet but inside it is said to hold a dybbuk - an evil spirit that can invade and possess a living person, per US Ghost Adventures. 'It is a very powerful item,' Bagans, 48, said, per People. 'To make a long story short, we began hearing things.' But eventually, upon returning to the room, Bagans said that still 'something wasn't right.' 'I remember putting my hand on the box and at that exact moment, Post put his hand on my shoulder,' Bagans recalled. 'At that moment, it was like something came through the box and into him, and I began shaking, I began trembling. 'This is kind of embarrassing, I began crying, I began screaming, and this is when he got me out of the room forcefully.' In the aftermath, Malone claimed to see a dark shadowy figure lingering outside. The box initially appeared in 2003 when Kevin Mannis, an antique store owner, bought a vintage wine box from a 103-year-old Holocaust survivor on eBay, per US Ghost Adventures. After a string of suspicious hauntings, the box was placed back on the site and bought by a man named Jason Haxton. He eventually also felt the horrors of the box and buried it in Missouri before sharing it on Bagan's show.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new satellite photo has revealed that the "megaberg," A23a, is beginning to break apart, spawning thousands of smaller ice chunks around the Antarctic island of South Georgia. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Iceberg A23a, which is beginning to break apart alongside South Georgia island A striking new satellite photo has revealed that the world's largest iceberg is starting to break apart into thousands of smaller pieces as it remains stuck alongside a wildlife refuge in Antarctica. But it could take months, if not years, for the entire slab to disappear. During this time, it has repeatedly held the title of "world's largest iceberg" as bigger bergs have come and gone, most recently regaining the title in June 2023. It remained spinning on the spot for several months before eventually breaking free in December 2024 and resuming its journey north through the Drake Passage — also known as the "iceberg graveyard," where large Antarctic icebergs get swept away to their eventual doom. Now, photos from NASA's Aqua satellite have revealed that the edges of A23a are starting to disintegrate, especially along its northern edge, blanketing the surrounding area with icy debris, according to NASA's Earth Observatory. "Thousands of iceberg pieces litter the ocean surface near the main berg, creating a scene reminiscent of a dark starry night," NASA representatives wrote.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. This type of iceberg disintegration is known as "edge wasting" and has shrunk A23a by around 200 square miles (520 square km) since it became stuck in March, according to NASA. At this rate, it will likely take several months, if not years, for the berg to fully break apart, assuming larger cracks do not rip it apart first. However, A23a may not hold its size title for long, because as of May 16, it is only around 12 square miles (31 square km) larger than the next-biggest iceberg, D15A, according to the U.S. National Ice Center. South Georgia is not inhabited by people, aside from a few dozen researchers who visit throughout the year. However, it is home to an abundance of wildlife, such as seals and seabirds, including more than 2 million penguins, according to BirdLife International. Having a large iceberg moored just offshore can be problematic for these species, especially for penguins that may have to travel several hundred extra miles around the obstruction to reach their prey, depending on where the iceberg is located. Meltwater coming from trapped bergs can also alter the temperature and salinity of their surroundings. —Ghostly figure emerges in Greenland ice after underground lake collapses —Trio of ringed ice caps look otherworldly on Russian Arctic islands This is not the first time that South Georgia has been put under siege by giant icebergs. In 2020, one of the world's previous largest icebergs, A68, became stuck even closer to the island, sparking fears that it could disrupt penguin colonies. As human-caused climate change continues to cause increased melting of Antarctica's ice sheets, many more hefty bergs could soon pass by South Georgia in the coming decades.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When a former president receives a serious medical diagnosis, the traditional response has been to set aside political differences, offer warm praise and wish the individual a speedy recovery and complete return to health. In many cases, that's exactly what happened Sunday after former president Joe Biden disclosed that he has an aggressive form of prostate cancer. But in a reflection of today's harsh political environment and reignited questions over Biden's health during his reelection campaign and his inner circle's handling of the situation, some Republicans and right-wing activists wasted little time asserting, without evidence, that Biden and his circle covered up the diagnosis. Trump, speaking in the Oval Office on Monday, said the diagnosis was “very sad, actually” and that he felt “badly about it.” But he also questioned why it wasn't caught earlier. “If you take a look, it's the same doctor that said that Joe was cognitively fine, there was nothing wrong with him,” Trump said. “Unbelievable this was missed, but the truth is, his physician was more concerned about assisting with the political cover up than providing world class medical care,” Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas) posted on social media Sunday night. He drew attention in 2018 for an effusive report on Trump's condition, saying the president had done “exceedingly well” on a cognitive exam and had “incredible genes.” The varying messages emerged as Biden thanked Americans on Monday for their “love and support.” “Cancer touches us all,” Biden wrote on X in his first public comment about the diagnosis. “Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places. Thank you for lifting us up with love and support.” His cancer diagnosis renewed debate about who should receive annual screenings, and at what age, for signs of the disease. Prostate cancer specialists told The Washington Post that it is not unusual for someone Biden's age to skip screening for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which, when elevated, can indicate a higher risk of prostate cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which makes medical recommendations about preventive services such as screenings, explicitly recommends against PSA screening in men 70 years and older. For men ages 55 to 69, the decision should be an individual one, it says. Biden's prognosis depends on many factors that are not known publicly, said William Dahut, chief scientific officer of the American Cancer Society. “I didn't say that there was a conspiracy,” Emanuel said. Oncologists specializing in prostate cancer said even aggressive cancers can appear suddenly or without symptoms. “It's certainly possible for more aggressive, advanced cancers to develop in a setting with low PSA, or develop and spread rather quickly, on the order of less than a year,” said Jason Efstathiou, a prostate radiation oncologist at Mass General Brigham. '” said TJ Ducklo, a Biden aide who during the 2020 presidential campaign was treated for Stage 4 lung cancer. Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, posted an accusatory message just hours after Biden's diagnosis became public suggesting the Biden family hid his condition. Some of the criticism has focused on Biden's last medical report as president, in February 2024, when his physician declared Biden in good health and cited no prostate issues. Some conservatives say that exam should have picked up Biden's cancer, so either it wasn't performed or the White House is covering it up. “Is Team Biden accusing the WH physician of malpractice? Again,” conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wrote on social media. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday reiterated Trump's supportive comments about Biden from Sunday night. The White House physician we have here is phenomenal.” For years, Trump and some of his prominent allies have been quick to embrace and spread conspiracy theories about political opponents, giving them a particular resonance with his supporters, said Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami. “People who have a conspiratorial worldview or who don't like Biden for whatever reason will not trust information about Biden, and they will come up with their own explanations,” said Uscinski, who studies conspiracy theories. But the situation has been complicated by renewed accusations that Biden's team covered up his cognitive decline as he pushed ahead with reelection. That charge is leveled in several new books, including “Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again” by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. “Original Sin” is scheduled to publish Tuesday — but now it will appear in a suddenly altered landscape. Biden received the diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer on Friday, his office said. That evening, Axios published an excerpt from Biden's 2023 interview with special counsel Robert K. Hur, in which Biden speaks haltingly, including a digression about Beau's death. “In 2017, Beau had passed and … this is personal …” Biden can be heard saying. “I know you're all close with your sons and daughters, but Beau was like my right arm, and Hunter was my left.” Hunter is Biden's younger son. Biden's office announced his diagnosis on Sunday night, saying it “represents a more aggressive form” of cancer but that it appears to be sensitive to hormone therapy, allowing “for effective management.” Vice President JD Vance said he wished Biden “the best” of health, but argued it was still fair to question whether his advisers hid his condition. “You can separate the desire for him to have the right health outcome with a recognition that whether it was doctors or whether there were staffers … I don't think he was able to do a good job for the American people,” he added. Dan Merica and Ariana Eunjung Cha contributed to this report. Tariffs and the economy: China and the United States agreed to lower tariffs on goods from each other's countries for 90 days. Trump's 10 percent “universal” tariff on all imports is still in place. First 100 days: Trump is facing growing opposition to his ambitious and controversial agenda, with his approval rating in decline, according to a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll. But inside the White House, Trump's team isn't dissuaded. Here's a look at Trump's first 100 days in 10 charts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The base is no stranger to UFO sightings, but a January 2023 incident saw a mystery object smack right into the cockpit canopy of a $63 million F-16 Viper, causing damage and grounding the fighter, as per Federal Aviation Administration documents first reported by the War Zone. These papers describe the culprit as "an orange-white UAS," or "uncrewed aerial system," a term typically used for drones. That very day, three more run-ins with these UAS were reported. The FAA said it "documents Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) sightings whenever a pilot reports one to an air traffic control facility." The Department of Defense All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office serves as the centralized clearing house for UAP reporting impacting national security or safety." Unidentified flying objects, known to travel in groups of up to eight, have been spotted darting across the Arizona skies, particularly near military air combat training sites. A whopping 757 similar incidents were recorded between May 2023 and June 2024, according to the Anomaly Resolution Office. Of these, 708 remain unresolved, with only 49 cases marked as "Case closed". Following the 2023 Chinese spy balloon incident, procedures for dealing with such events have been significantly tightened. UFOs are now "clearly being passed through multiple U.S. military reporting streams," as per War Zone. Ron Vitiello, a senior adviser for US Customs and Border Protection, has speculated that these enigmatic drones could be tools used by foreign cartels for espionage or smuggling operations. In a recent chat with "News Nation Prime", Vitiello suggested that cartels, with their seemingly "unlimited funding", might be using advanced technology not yet seen before. "Maybe they've got technology that we're not used to seeing in the drone space," Vitiello mused. Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>
