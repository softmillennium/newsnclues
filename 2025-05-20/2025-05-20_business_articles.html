                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk said Tuesday that he expects Tesla and xAI will continue buying chips from semiconductor giants Nvidia and AMD, and possibly others. Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, which now owns X (formerly Twitter) has already installed 200,000 GPUs at its Colossus facility in Memphis, the Tesla CEO told CNBC's David Faber on Tuesday. XAI is also planning a 1 million GPU facility outside of Memphis, Musk said. He did not specify how many chips the company had already ordered and by which date they may be installed. "A few years ago, I made a very obvious prediction, which is that the limitation on AI will be chips," he said. At his autos business, Tesla, Musk said the company's Dojo supercomputer in Buffalo, New York is already used for training its Autopilot and Optimus robotics systems. Got a confidential news tip?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a voter, Quayle has cast his ballot for Donald Trump in three consecutive presidential elections. "We are not approaching the end," Quayle, who is now chairman of Cerberus Global Investments, said at the CNBC CEO Council Summit in Arizona on Tuesday. "Putin has no desire to see this come to a conclusion until he really dismantles Ukraine," he said. "I do not understand Trump's affinity for Putin and why he has not demanded anything here," he said. "All he wants to do as president is deals ... What leverage is he trying to put on Putin? Over the weekend, Trump had posted on Truth Social ahead of talks with Russian and Ukrainian leaders, "HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A PRODUCTIVE DAY, A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE, AND THIS VERY VIOLENT WAR, A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, WILL END," in his customary all-capitalized comments. On Monday, after an over two-hour call between Trump and Putin, the president said he wanted the "bloodbath" to end, but there was little sign of a breakthrough, even as Trump said Russia and Ukraine would hold direct talks on a ceasefire "immediately," on his social media platform. He also spoke to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday. "Putin says he won't agree to a ceasefire, he just wants to talk, Trump says OK," Quayle told CNBC's Sara Eisen in an interview at the CEO Council Summit. He said the lack of pressure also undermines a U.S. policy alliance with the European Union, that if Russia did not agree to a ceasefire there would be secondary sanctions. "Putin said let's talk, and Trump says yes, and European leaders just had the rug pulled out from under them," Quayle said. "I don't think it will end any time soon," he added. Quayle's view of the Russian playbook is that all along it's been to "dismantle Ukraine, and time is on his side." And even though Putin has not been as successful as he would have liked on the battlefield, "he's been very successful with Trump," Quayle said, adding that Putin's KGB background makes him and his circle well placed to know Trump's "weakness and vulnerability and how to deal with him." While Quayle does not believe Trump can unilaterally "wash his hands" of the conflict when he finally realizes Putin has no interest in a ceasefire — "Congress has something to say about that and there is still bipartisan support for Ukraine," he said — Quayle says the president has blown an opportunity to apply pressure in three ways that would work to change Putin's approach. To end the war, the U.S. needs "lots of money in Swiss banks that are Russian given to Ukraine," Quayle said. Second, the U.S. needs to give Ukraine even more weapons. Third, there needs to be secondary sanctions on Russia. "Suddenly, Putin would come to the table if you do those three things," Quayle said. But Quayle does not think this will happen. The strategy on Russia leaves Quayle perplexed. "I don't have an answer," he said. While he noted that Trump is fond of saying it's "Biden's war," he believes there will be political repercussions for the President's already weakened popularity if Trump lets Ukraine fall. "You inherited this war, but it is on your watch, and if he completely walks away from Ukraine, which I don't think he will, but he might, there will be a significant political price." "American people do not like war, but they do not like losing wars, and if he is viewed as the loser on this, there will be a price to pay, so he needs to figure it out," Quayle said. While Trump warned Zelenskyy that he was risking World War III in their infamous Oval Office meeting, Quayle says the bigger risk is the current Trump strategy: "You really want to talk about who is risking [WWIII]? During the interview, Quayle also seemed perplexed by Trump's tariffs strategy. he said in response to a question's framing. "I don't think there's a strategy. In the short term, I don't think there's going to be a huge impact, but long term, capital expenditures are being delayed, supply chains are being disrupted. It will be inflationary down the road," he said. On China, he said there can be no total de-coupling between the two nations given $600 billion in trade, but companies are moving away from China as much as it is possible and where it is practicable as part of long-term planning. The Trump administration does realize the much bigger question is how to "prevent a hot war between the United States and China, not tomorrow or next month or two years from now, but down the road," he said. Quayle added that while Trump's recent trip to the Middle East was "successful" and the deals are a win for the U.S. in terms of countering China's growing influence in the wealthy, geopolitically sensitive region, his approach to Russia and Putin isn't helping. does not believe there is any near-term threat of a full invasion of Taiwan by China, certain smaller, relatively lightly populated islands closer to mainland China could be targeted. "China is watching Ukraine carefully because of Taiwan," he said. "Looking at the situation in Ukraine, and watching how Russia avoids these sanctions, and Russia is doing a good job of it. Xi Jinping is looking at that," Quayle said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Xreal on Tuesday announced a set of so-called "extended reality" glasses that run Google's Android XR software, as the companies look to take on Meta and Apple in a new arena. The launch marks an early step from Alphabet's Google to become a major operating system for future virtual and augmented reality smart glasses and headsets, much like Android has turned into a default option for most smartphones. Xreal, a Chinese company backed by Alibaba, calls its glasses Project Aura and describes them as a lightweight extended reality — or XR — product. XR is a broad term encompassing technologies that merge real and virtual worlds. Android XR, Google's operating system for these products, was launched last year and is infused with its AI assistant Gemini. Samsung's Project Moohan, a type of headset that looks to rival Apple's $3,500 Vision Pro, was the first device announced that runs Android XR. Samsung plans to launch the hardware this year. Xreal's Project Aura is the second device announced that will operate on Android XR, and it is the first such device in the glasses format. Xreal said the glasses will have Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR chips, which are specially designed for these pieces of hardware. Xreal also said the glasses will be "tethered," meaning they will connect to another device to run. The company has not yet provided details on what the glasses will need to be linked to. The timeline and price of Project Aura were not immediately disclosed. A large part of any operating system's success is the quality of apps available for users. For Xreal, being an early partner with Google and working with Qualcomm will give it access to the latest technology in the XR space, as well as to marketing for its products. The launch of Project Aura also marks a step up competition with Meta and its continued efforts with the Meta Ray-Ban product and the likes of Snap, which unveiled a new set of its Spectacles last year. Glasses also offer an alternative to bulky headsets. Tech giants including Apple and Meta see extended reality as a potential new paradigm in computing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chinese-born crypto mogul Justin Sun says he's the top holder of the $TRUMP meme token and will be having dinner with President Donald Trump. On Thursday, the top 220 $TRUMP holders are invited to a dinner with the president at his Virginia golf club outside of Washington, D.C. Late Monday night, Sun posted on X that he had secured the top spot in the $TRUMP token leaderboard, which earned him an invite to a dinner with the president, as well as a VIP reception for the top 25 holders. "Honored to support @POTUS and grateful for the invitation from @GetTrumpMemes to attend President Trump's Gala Dinner as his TOP fan!" "As the top holder of $TRUMP, I'm excited to connect with everyone, talk crypto, and discuss the future of our industry." Sun now holds $18.6 million worth of the Trump-themed meme token, on top of the $75 million he previously poured into World Liberty Financial — a separate crypto venture that routes 75% of the platform's revenue directly to Trump-owned entities. Altogether, Sun's stake in the Trump family's crypto empire now tops $93 million. His case was paused in February, shortly after investing tens of millions of dollars into World Liberty's WLFI token. Like with other meme coins, there's no underlying product. The project's website says the coins "are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type." The SEC issued guidance in February saying that most meme coins are not considered securities under U.S. federal law. Watchdog group Accountable.US referred to the moment as seeing "corruption unfold in real time" and renewed warnings that the $TRUMP token competition is opening backdoor access to foreign and corporate actors with little oversight and major stakes in Trump-linked assets. "This dubious situation perfectly sums up why this $TRUMP coin competition was always going to become a magnet for foreign influence, unprecedented self-dealing and next level swampiness," said Tony Carrk, executive director of Accountable.US. Documents from blockchain analytics firm Inca Digital that were reviewed by CNBC show where the top 275 $TRUMP token holders send and receive the token. Many are heavily tied to international exchanges like Binance that don't service U.S. customers, an indication that they're likely not U.S. citizens. An analysis by Bloomberg revealed that 19 of the top 25 wallets are almost certainly owned by individuals operating outside the U.S. The leaderboard — now closed — captured an extraordinary concentration of wealth and influence behind a volatile asset launched just days before the inauguration. More than $5.2 billion in realized gains have flowed to the top-performing wallets, while a larger number of addresses — over 590,000 — have collectively lost $3.9 billion, according to Inca Digital.

Apple Intelligence technology will be opened up to developers under a new plan.

Apple Inc. is preparing to allow third-party developers to write software using its artificial intelligence models, aiming to spur the creation of new applications and make its devices more enticing. 

The iPhone maker is working on a software development kit and related frameworks that will let outsiders build AI features based on the large language models that the company uses for Apple Intelligence, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Apple expects to unveil the plan on June 9 at its Worldwide Developers Conference, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative hasn't been announced.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is an excerpt from "Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman's OpenAI" by Karen Hao. The author reached out to all of the key figures and companies that are described in this book to seek interviews and comment. OpenAI and Sam Altman chose not to cooperate. In November 2022, rumors began to spread within OpenAI that its rival Anthropic was testing — and would soon release — a new chatbot. If it didn't launch first, OpenAI risked losing its leading position, which could deliver a big hit to morale for employees who had worked long and tough hours to retain that dominance. Anthropic had not in fact been planning any imminent releases. But for OpenAI executives, the rumors were enough to trigger a decision: The company wouldn't wait to ready GPT-4 into a chatbot; it would release John Schulman's chat-enabled GPT-3.5 model with the Superassistant team's brand-new chat interface in two weeks, right after Thanksgiving. No one truly fathomed the societal phase shift they were about to unleash. To be safe, the infrastructure team provisioned enough server capacity for 100,000 users. On Wednesday, November 30, most employees didn't even realize that the launch had happened. It would leave the company's engineers and researchers completely miffed even years later. GPT-3.5 hadn't been that much of a capability improvement over GPT-3, which had already been out for two years. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman later said that he'd believed ChatGPT would be popular but by something like "one order of magnitude less." "To all of us, they'd downgraded the thing we'd been using internally and launched it." Within five days, OpenAI cofounder Greg Brockman tweeted that ChatGPT had crossed one million users. Within two months, it had reached 100 million, becoming what was then the fastest-growing consumer app in history. At the same time, it was this very blockbuster success that would place extraordinary strain on the company. With every team stretched dangerously thin, managers begged Altman for more head count. But Altman worried about what would happen to company culture and mission alignment if the company scaled up its staff too quickly. He believed firmly in maintaining a small staff and high talent density. "We should try very hard to resist this — what has worked for us so far is being small, focused, high-trust, low-bullshit, and intense. The overhead of too many people and too much bureaucracy can easily kill great ideas or result in sclerosis." He was now repeating this to executives in late 2022, emphasizing during head count discussions the need to keep the company lean and the talent bar high, and add no more than 100 or so hires. At the rate that their teams were burning out, many saw the need for something closer to around 500 or even more new people. By summer, there were as many as 30, even 50, people joining OpenAI each week, including more recruiters to scale up hiring even faster. By fall, the company had blown well past its own self-imposed quota. The sudden growth spurt indeed changed company culture. A recruiter wrote a manifesto about how the pressure to hire so quickly was forcing his team to lower the quality bar for talent. "If you want to build Meta, you're doing a great job," he said in a pointed jab at Altman, alluding to the very fears that the CEO had warned about. The rapid expansion was also leading to an uptick in firings. During his onboarding, one manager was told to swiftly document and report any underperforming members of his team, only to be let go himself sometime later. People routinely discovered that colleagues had been fired only by noticing when a Slack account grayed out from being deactivated. To new hires, fully bought into the idea that they were joining a fast-moving, money-making startup, the tumult felt like a particularly chaotic, at times brutal, manifestation of standard corporate problems: poor management, confusing priorities, the coldhearted ruthlessness of a capitalistic company willing to treat its employees as disposable. Many people coming aboard were simply holding on for dear life until their one-year mark to get access to the first share of their equity. For some employees who remembered the scrappy early days of OpenAI as a tight-knit, mission-driven nonprofit, its dramatic transformation into a big, faceless corporation was far more shocking and emotional. "OpenAI is Burning Man," Rob Mallery, a former recruiter, says, referring to how the desert art festival scaled to the point that it lost touch with its original spirit. "I know it meant a lot more to the people who were there at the beginning than it does to everyone now." In those early years, the team had set up a Slack channel called #explainlikeimfive that allowed employees to submit anonymous questions about technical topics. In mid-2023, an employee posted that the company was hiring too many people not aligned with the mission or passionate about building AGI. Another person responded: They knew OpenAI was going downhill once it started hiring people who could look you in the eye. As OpenAI was rapidly professionalizing and gaining more exposure and scrutiny, incoherence at the top was becoming more consequential. Now there were several public-facing departments: In addition to the communications team, a legal team was writing legal opinions and dealing with a growing number of lawsuits. The policy team was stretching out across continents. But on numerous occasions, the lack of strategic clarity was leading to confused public messaging. At the end of 2023, The New York Times would sue OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement for training on millions of its articles. OpenAI's response in early January, written by the legal team, delivered an unusually feisty hit back, accusing the Times of "intentionally manipulating our models" to generate evidence for its argument. That same week, OpenAI's policy team delivered a submission to the UK House of Lords communications and digital select committee, saying that it would be "impossible" for OpenAI to train its cutting-edge models without copyrighted materials. "There's just so much confusion all the time," says an employee in a public-facing department. "I don't know if there is a strategic priority in the C suite. I honestly think people just make their own decisions. Karen Hao is an award-winning journalist covering the impacts of artificial intelligence on society.
