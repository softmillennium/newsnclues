Due to overwhelming popularity, with sold-out screenings in 25 markets across the globe, Warner Bros. Pictures and IMAX have announced they are expanding their Fan-First Premiere Screenings of Apple Original Films' F1 The Movie to 400 IMAX houses worldwide. Tickets go on sale tomorrow, 21 May at 9am PT/5pm BST for these Fan-First Premiere Screenings in IMAX and can be found here. Tickets will also go on general sale tomorrow at 9am PT/5pm BST for all available showtimes of the film when it lands in theatres later that week. The new film stars Brad Pitt, is directed by Joseph Kosinski and is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, Kosinski, seven-time Formula 1 World Champion Lewis Hamilton, Pitt, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner and Chad Oman. Thirty years later, he's a nomadic racer-for-hire when he's approached by his former team mate Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), the owner of a struggling Formula 1 team that is on the verge of collapse. He'll drive alongside Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), the team's hotshot rookie intent on setting his own pace. But as the engines roar, Sonny's past catches up with him and he finds that in Formula 1, your team mate is your fiercest competition—and the road to redemption is not something you can travel alone. Collaborating with Kosinski behind the scenes are his creative team, including director of photography Claudio Miranda, production designers Mark Tildesley and Ben Munro, editor Stephen Mirrione, costume designer Julian Day, casting director Lucy Bevan and composer Hans Zimmer.

POWER RANKINGS: Who impressed our judges during an incident-packed weekend at Imola?

There has been a lot of intrigue recently about how an ingenious McLaren rear brake duct design is helping the MCL39 have better tyre temperature control than the others. At circuits which induce particularly high rear tyre temperatures, it has helped amplify McLaren's advantage.

Although the exact way the duct is configured internally is not yet widely known, the FIA has checked and confirmed that the design is in full compliance with the regulations and that it has no concerns about it.
