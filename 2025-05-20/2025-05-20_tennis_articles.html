                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Sara Errani played her first professional tournament in April 2002, 47 of the competitors in this year's Roland Garros qualifying draw had yet to be born. Nonetheless, at the age of 38, two days removed from lifting the Internazionali BNL d'Italia doubles trophy alongside Jasmine Paolini and 13 years removed from her appearance in the Roland Garros final, the Italian proved that she's still got it. The match was a microcosm of her career. Seemingly down and out, overpowered by a stronger and taller opponent, Errani used her heart, brains and sheer grit to turn an apparent lost cause into a glorious victory -- as she's done so often over the past two decades. In the second-set tiebreak, Niemeier hammered overhead after overhead at Errani, but it was the veteran who won that point with a clean winner. Next up, she'll face Niemeier's German compatriot, Anna-Lena Friedsam, who held off a late comeback attempt by 16-year-old wild card Ksenia Efremova 6-1, 7-5. Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko has had a sensational season so far -- five ITF trophies, a final at the Parma WTA 125 and eye-catching performances in Miami and Rome, where she stretched Paula Badosa and Coco Gauff to three sets. The 18-year-old, at a career high of No. 122 and playing the first Grand Slam qualifying event of her career, kept her momentum going with a 6-4, 6-2 defeat of Sinja Kraus. Next up is Liechtenstein's Kathinka Von Deichmann, who routed No.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic has confirmed that Dusan Vemic will work with him heading into this month's French Open following his split from Andy Murray. Vemic, 48, is a former professional player who himself played in the French Open. However, he also stressed that compatriot Vemic will not serve as his full-time trainer, and insisted he would not be rushed into any decision. He said: "At the moment, I'm not in need of a coach. "I don't need to rush in any context. There were high hopes for Djokovic's working alongside Murray but the Serb's form dipped later into their exciting partnership. And he addressed their split during his press conference. He added "We felt like we couldn't get more out of that partnership on the court, and that's all there is to it. My respect towards Andy remains the same, even more actually, I got to know him as a person. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Djokovic will be desperate to kick on in Geneva this week as he goes in search of his 100th ATP title after withdrawing from the Italian Open. He hasn't won a single clay-court match so far this season and is looking to rediscover his form ahead of the French Open starting on Sunday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic says he "couldn't get more" out of his partnership with Andy Murray but is in no rush to find a new coach. The Serb, who turns 38 on Thursday, parted company with former rival Murray earlier in May after six months working together. The French Open starts on Sunday, with Djokovic seeking a standalone record 25th Grand Slam title. On his time working with Murray, Djokovic said: "We felt like we couldn't get more out of that partnership on the court, and that's all there is to it. "My respect towards Andy remains the same, even more actually, I got to know him as a person. Djokovic has yet to win a match on clay this year, having suffered early exits in Monte Carlo and Madrid before skipping the Italian Open. "At the moment, I'm not in need of a coach," Djokovic said. Djokovic reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open in his first tournament working with Britain's former world number one Murray, before he was forced to retire through injury. He has had a difficult start to the 2025 season, losing his first match in four of his past five tournaments and being beaten in the Miami Open final by Czech 19-year-old Jakub Mensik. Before his campaign in Geneva, Djokovic has not won on clay this season after losing his opening matches in Monte Carlo and Madrid. Among his 24 major titles - which leaves him tied with Margaret Court for the all-time record - the French Open is his least successful, with three triumphs. "It's a different chapter of my life that I'm trying to navigate myself through," Djokovic said. "I'm not particularly used to having this kind of circumstances where I would lose a consecutive match, tournaments, first rounds and so forth. I don't think it ever happened for me in the last 20 years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But then you spend time in his company and realise he is slightly unusual. Though he played county level as a child, he enjoyed various sports as a teenager before a tennis scholarship to Culford School in Suffolk – “I don't know how we weaselled that!” – inspired him to attend college in North Carolina, where he read economics. “We'd have two hours' training in the afternoon, a foreign concept to me,” he says. Though he acknowledges that “it's pretty tough to see a hundred 12-year-olds and say which'll be a champion”, even when he excelled in the US no one paid attention. So he agreed to join Ernst & Young as a technology risk consultant, but was saved by the pandemic, doing well enough in bubble events for his family to insist he pursued tennis seriously. “Thank goodness they talked me around otherwise I wouldn't be sitting here. It completely engrosses you and takes your mind off whatever else is going on.” Patten's calm sense of perspective is striking, but a debut grand slam final is of a palpably different order – especially for an unseeded, unknown Briton in SW19. “But this time I couldn't stop smiling, it's the coolest thing ever. I went completely blank so Harri came and said, ‘Your serve is great, serve here; I'm going to go here,' which usually the server would dictate. I served an ace and said, ‘OK, now tell me how to serve on this one.” Doubles, though, suffers from a chronic lack of funding, coverage and care, despite proof – exemplified by Patten's experiences – that people love it. “You see a lot more variation in the shots – singles is mainly baseline rallies, but doubles has net play with quick hands, it's absolute carnage. Fundamentally, you're dealing with extremely competitive 30-year-old men who travel the world together – it's a recipe for disaster!” Patten also has a vision for change, citing padel as an example. Most sports, the spectacle is great but it's really about being with friends and having a nice time, so you could turn doubles into something different, with music and free crowd movement. Doubles has a great chance of becoming this unique, fun event … if the authorities let it.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States Tennis Association (USTA) has announced an $800 million investment, unveiling plans to reimagine Arthur Ashe Stadium and construct a cutting-edge Player Performance Center to elevate the US Open's global stature and athlete experience in Flushing. The investment, which represents the largest single investment in US Open history, will elevate fan, player and partner experience at the annual tournament at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, USTA officials said at a launch event at the Times Center at 242 W 41st St. in Manhattan on Monday evening. Officials said the project will be funded entirely from the USTA's coffers and is scheduled to completed by the 2027 US Open, with work to take place across multiple phases. USTA CEO Lew Sherr said spectators may not immediately notice a difference inside Arthur Ashe when the work is complete but said that is part of the idea. However, the work will also include noticeable upgrades to the stadium's concourses and suite levels, Sherr said. Get the Full StoryNews, events, culture and more — delivered to you. Renderings for the redesigned Arthur Ashe Stadium, which will include more courtside seats and an enhanced experience for US Open fans in the upper decks. The new suites will also have access to enhanced dining options and hospitality spaces in addition to their own dedicated concourse, National Tennis Center Chief Operating Office Daniel Zausner said Monday. He noted that the loge and promenade areas currently make up more than 19,000 seats at Ashe and said the redesign will help bring fans closer to the action. Plans also include a brand-new “visually-striking” grand entrance to the famous stadium. Renderings for the new grand entrance to Arthur Ashe. Meanwhile, the planned Player Performance Center will be built on the top two floors of a new four-story building on the west side of Arthur Ashe, providing players with expansive locker rooms, lounges, dining areas, a new player-only café and a dedicated entrance for players entering the US Open complex. The $250 million center will be housed above a two-story parking lot within the new four-story building. Renderings for the new Player Performance Center adjacent to Arthur Ashe. Photo: USTA Zausner noted that only eight to ten players would be playing on Ashe on a given day during the US Open and said the Player Performance Center is an effort to cater to all players and their staff. He said close to 2,800 players and members of their teams attend the event every year. Tennis legend John McEnroe, a four-time winner at the US Open, said the new performance center would be a big hit among the players, adding that he experiences a pang of jealously when he sees the facilities available to modern-day pros. “The players are going to love this,” McEnroe said Monday. “There's a twinge of jealousy and envy, but it's also pride, because, in a way, I'd like to think that we've all been part of this in a certain way. “There's no way anyone can tell you that Arthur Ashe is not rocking at night – it's rocking hard.” Construction on the redevelopment of Arthur Ashe is already underway, with structural work reinforcing the column load for the venue ongoing since last fall. The new grand entrance, designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, will also be completed ahead of the 2027 tournament. The center will be constructed ahead of the 2026 US Open but will not be accessible to players until 2027, with interior work set to be carried out between 2026 and 2027. USTA officials said the work would not impact capacity or fan experience at Arthur Ashe Stadium over the next three years. Asked if the $800 investment would result in a hike in prices for guests, Sherr pointed to expansions of Fan Week, a free week-long event that takes place in the week leading up to the main draw of the US Open. He said the event has been expanded significantly in recent years, noticing that fans will have free access to the mixed doubles championship for 2025. He also stated that USTA underprices and subsidizes a significant number of tickets to make the event more affordable for more people. We don't back away from that,” Sherr said. “We feel great about the value that we deliver to fans, and the marketplace certainly speaks with their with their wallets.” Sherr said the project, which will be funded from USTA reserves and debt leveraged against anticipated profits from the planned redevelopment, will help the USTA to re-invest more money back into tennis across the United States. He said tennis has experienced five years of continued growth in the US, moving from 17.7 million players in 2019 to almost 26 million players last year. However, he said the growth has been so quick that there are now not enough coaches and courts to support people who want to get lessons and learn how to play the sport. Sherr said the $800 million investment will help USTA reach its goal of reaching 35 million players across the country by 2035. “Our investments are being redirected to make sure that we continue to support growth,” Sherr said. “When you come back in 2027 for the 30th anniversary, you will see a brand new Arthur Ashe stadium, both on the inside and outside,” Zausner said. USTA CEO Lew Sherr said spectators may not immediately notice a difference inside Arthur Ashe when the work is complete but said that is part of the idea. However, the work will also include noticeable upgrades to the stadium's concourses and suite levels, Sherr said.

Tennis legend John McEnroe, a four-time winner at the US Open, said the new performance center would be a big hit among the players, adding that he experiences a pang of jealously when he sees the facilities available to modern-day pros. “The players are going to love this,” McEnroe said Monday. “There's a twinge of jealousy and envy, but it's also pride, because, in a way, I'd like to think that we've all been part of this in a certain way. “There's no way anyone can tell you that Arthur Ashe is not rocking at night – it's rocking hard.” Construction on the redevelopment of Arthur Ashe is already underway, with structural work reinforcing the column load for the venue ongoing since last fall. The new grand entrance, designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, will also be completed ahead of the 2027 tournament. The center will be constructed ahead of the 2026 US Open but will not be accessible to players until 2027, with interior work set to be carried out between 2026 and 2027. USTA officials said the work would not impact capacity or fan experience at Arthur Ashe Stadium over the next three years. Asked if the $800 investment would result in a hike in prices for guests, Sherr pointed to expansions of Fan Week, a free week-long event that takes place in the week leading up to the main draw of the US Open. He said the event has been expanded significantly in recent years, noticing that fans will have free access to the mixed doubles championship for 2025. He also stated that USTA underprices and subsidizes a significant number of tickets to make the event more affordable for more people. We don't back away from that,” Sherr said. “We feel great about the value that we deliver to fans, and the marketplace certainly speaks with their with their wallets.” Sherr said the project, which will be funded from USTA reserves and debt leveraged against anticipated profits from the planned redevelopment, will help the USTA to re-invest more money back into tennis across the United States. He said tennis has experienced five years of continued growth in the US, moving from 17.7 million players in 2019 to almost 26 million players last year. However, he said the growth has been so quick that there are now not enough coaches and courts to support people who want to get lessons and learn how to play the sport. Sherr said the $800 million investment will help USTA reach its goal of reaching 35 million players across the country by 2035. “Our investments are being redirected to make sure that we continue to support growth,” Sherr said. “When you come back in 2027 for the 30th anniversary, you will see a brand new Arthur Ashe stadium, both on the inside and outside,” Zausner said.

Plans also include a brand-new “visually-striking” grand entrance to the famous stadium. Renderings for the new grand entrance to Arthur Ashe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was not for a reason you might expect, though. It was because of my mental health. When it was bad, I started to forget things. I knew it was going too far at Roland Garros, because what was happening in my head at tournaments began affecting my life outside the court. It made me think I was going crazy. It became a matter of going through the motions. When it came time for my first-round match in Paris, it felt like I was not really on the court. I was not present except for my feet on the clay, so it was no surprise that I lost in straight sets. I tried to take one or two weeks off to see if that would help before heading to Surbiton for an ATP Challenger Tour event on grass. Instead, I actually had a panic attack on court. As you can imagine, these things were very scary. During Wimbledon, I needed to pull off the road, stop and get out of the car because it sometimes felt like I could pass out. Somehow I made the third round of the tournament, but for half of my match against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, I mentally blacked out. I just remember wanting to run off the court. It was an absurd place to be — I was playing at one of the events I dreamt of competing in as a kid and all I wanted was to be somewhere else or somebody else. Soon enough, I knew something had to change. The first time I spoke to a professional about my mental health was about 10 years ago, but my struggles became an issue more recently. Three years ago in Miami was the first time that I experienced a real panic attack. There is such a thin line between feeling normal nerves and something more. Everybody has it different and that comes with sports, or really any profession. One morning in Florida I woke up and felt like somebody was strangling me. My mind was going crazy with a million thoughts swirling around. By the time we arrived, I was shaking. At that point, I was barely able to hold back tears long enough to tell my coach that I was not okay. I felt so terrible and did not know what was going on. Somehow I was able to calm down a bit, went on court to face Maxime Cressy and won the match. Afterwards, I talked about it a little bit with my team, but not that much. Once I stepped on the court, I was able to just switch it off and just focus on tennis. Nobody would have known what I had gone through. Ruusuvuori celebrates during his match against Sinner. I had recently made my first ATP Tour final in Pune and the following year I reached a career-high No. I was doing pretty well despite it all. Part of the problem is that I learned the way to have success on the tennis court, and then I just followed that as long as it lasted. I was just keeping my mouth shut. Being a professional athlete, you try to survive any issues, forget them and just leave them behind in the hopes they go away. I was somehow able to do it, and that is the cruel part of sports. After Wimbledon last year, I started with a new team and attempted to play in Washington. When I went to bed, I started to have this feeling that there was someone else in the room. There was a kind of fear, a feeling that someone was there trying to harm me. I beat Borna Coric in three tough sets, but the tennis was not the most difficult part. I traveled to Montreal but withdrew citing the stomach flu, but it was really because of my mind. I did not touch a racquet for four and a half months after that and some of those days were the toughest. For the past 10 years, life was so consistent. Everything was always moving and suddenly I did not have that anymore. I didn't really feel joy in anything anymore. I wasn't competing on court, and now I was fighting to get out of bed and honestly even had thoughts about whether I wanted to live, which was very scary. I could not go on a tennis court, especially in Finland. I did not want to see people involved in tennis because I could not answer their questions. Something that helped was playing quite a bit of padel. I learned how important it was to have some things that interested me. During the summer I began speaking to my psychologist once a week and told my very close family and friends what I was dealing with, which helped. One of my closest friends went through something similar, which made me realise that I was not alone in this. That is a big reason why I decided to tell my story earlier this month on video in Finnish. It is about how you handle them. When the video was released, it was like a weight dropped off my shoulders, because I felt like I was always pretending in front of people. I received a lot of very positive messages. Many different people with different jobs commented and you could see that it doesn't matter what you do. Everybody has their own struggles they need to overcome. A good thing going through this process is that I became okay with the idea that I might not play again. Before that was not even an option. It took a while to get my body ready to be able to compete again, and my first tournament back was in February at an ATP Challenger Tour event in Tenerife. It was just so difficult to be on court. The second one was a little bit better, but they have been up and down since. Last month I went to South Korea and had one of my worst panic attacks. I woke up in the morning and my heart was beating way too fast. I was sitting and my heartbeat was 100 RPMs, and my normal resting heartbeat is around 37. When the thoughts start coming and going over the top, I have more tools to calm myself down. I was able to make my dream come true and become a tennis player. I didn't really talk about any mental problems because I saw them as a weakness. You have to, a little bit, of course. You can't feel good every day in sports — that's not the point. It is a struggle, you need to overcome these challenges. But you just need to feel like there's at least some purpose and passion for it and then you can do it. My main hope is for people to know that you should take care of your mind and look after yourselves. If you're not okay, there is no more important thing than helping yourself. Don't keep everything inside of you. It is okay to have a bad day. But always remember one thing: tough times don't last forever.

After two hours and 37 minutes, the hard-fought win belonged to Droguet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NICK KYRGIOS has sparked controversy by posing for pictures with Aussie rapper Ay Huncho. Huncho, real name Ali Younes, was bailed for AU$1.8million (£860k) following charges of alleged kidnapping and assault. The man was said to have been forced into the property's garage before being left unconscious by an assault. It was later heard in court that the victim did not co-operate with police, despite being left hospitalised with serious injuries. Ay Huncho is alleged to have been heard laughing about the kidnapping in an audio tape. Per The Daily Telegraph AU, Kyrgios and Ay Huncho were pictured together on May 9 at Fiction nightclub in Canberra. Kyrgios, 30, is claimed to have captioned the image: "Keep waiting on it @ayhuncho." He is set to perform in Adelaide on May 30. Kyrgios, meanwhile, is looking to reignite his tennis career. Having been plagued by a wrist injury, the former Wimbledon finalist has won just one tour match since October 2022. Kyrgios has not played since losing to Karen Khachanov in Miami two months ago. The former world No13 is set to return to action at Roland Garros, playing alongside compatriot Jordan Thompson in the doubles event. Earlier this year, Kyrgios split with long-term girlfriend Costeen Hatzi. Having broken up with Kyrgios following four years together, Costeen said: "We haven't spoken. Relationships sometimes end, and I believe it's for the best." Off the court, Kyrgios has built up his "Good Trouble" podcast. The tennis star has confirmed that he will perform live at Wimbledon Theatre ahead of this year's Championships.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States Tennis Association (USTA) has announced a major $800 million investment into New York City's  Billie Jean King National Tennis Center hub, which includes a “top-to-bottom” refurbishment of the iconic Arthur Ashe Stadium. For the Arthur Ashe Stadium, already the world's largest tennis-specific arena, this will mean an expanded capacity with 2,000 more seats, luxury hospitality suites, and a 40% larger concourse with expanded food and drink, retail, and dining offerings around the venue also planned. This investment will be entirely funded by the USTA, with no public funding required, with USTA chief executive and executive director Lew Sherr stating: “This project enables us to maintain the greatest stage in tennis—Arthur Ashe Stadium—which was constructed more than 25 years ago, and modernize it in a way that will set it up for the next 25 years.” Don't let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. As tennis has grown in recent years, so too has the US Open, which in 2024 attracted a record attendance of over one million fans for the first time. The 1,048,669 total over three weeks marks an 8% increase over 2023, itself a record-breaking year, while attendance for the two weeks of 2024's main draw reached a new high of 832,640. A year prior, in 2023, a record TV audience was measured, with 3.4 million viewers on ESPN tuning in to watch US star Coco Gauff's maiden US Open victory, he most-watched women's final of all time on major sports broadcaster ESPN. The men's final that year, a record-setting victory for Novak Djokovic, drew 2.3 million viewers, which was the most-watched men's final since 2019.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When fans take in the sights and sounds of the qualifying rounds at the French Open at Roland Garros, they will see at least one well-known player participating: former US Open champion Marin Čilić. Cilic is one of only two players—men's or women's singles—who have won a Grand Slam and later in their career taken part in Grand Slam qualifying rounds. The other example is 2010 French Open champion (and 2011 finalist) Francesca Schiavone, who had her best career results on clay. She successfully advanced to the main draw but lost in the first round to Viktoria Kuzmova in straight sets. Schiavone ended her career at age 37 with three consecutive first-round exits in Paris, despite her overall best Slam results being at Roland Garros. Her decline was notable: after reaching the 2011 French Open final, she never again advanced past the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam. Cilic's decline in form and ranking has not been as steep. His best result at the French Open actually came late in his career—in 2022, when he reached the semifinals after two previous quarterfinal appearances. It often took the skill of Roger Federer to prevent him from winning multiple majors. While injuries and age have slowed Cilic's career, his veteran knowledge of clay—gained from numerous battles against the likes of Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros—makes him one of the favorites to qualify and potentially cause an upset in the main draw. Cilic did win a Challenger Title in 2025, and set a record in the process, as it was nearly 18 years between Challenger titles. Cilic's 2022 run saw him defeat Russian stars Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev, and in the third round, home favorite Gilles Simon, before taking a set off Casper Ruud and losing the semifinal in four sets. Hailing from Croatia, and never one of the flashiest names on the ATP Tour, Cilic hasn't enjoyed as many wildcard opportunities as other veterans with similar credentials. For example, two players of Cilic's generation—former Slam champion Stan Wawrinka and French favorite Richard Gasquet—both received main draw wildcards in Paris, but no such opportunity was available for Cilic. Recent retirees like Andy Murray, and Rafael Nadal, and other historical names like Lleyton Hewitt consistently received wild cards if they couldn't secure direct entry, while Cilic's countryman Goran Ivanišević notably won Wimbledon in 2001 as a wild card, a wild card he received due to his strong past performances on grass and at the Wimbledon tournament. You can't help but root for the likable and determined Cilic as he grinds through the twilight of his career. As the clay-court season peaks in Paris, Naomi Osaka heads into the 2025 French Open with renewed purpose and growing momentum.</p>
