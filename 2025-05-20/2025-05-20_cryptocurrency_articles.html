                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If ETH reclaims the 2-week Gaussian Channel mid-line, a 90% rally could occur. Ethereum ETHUSD price is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,750 on its daily chart, forming a bull flag pattern with sights on the $3,000 to $3,100 resistance zone. An ETH breakout with rising RSI and volume could confirm the bullish move, while a drop below $2,400 risks invalidating the pattern. On May 20, Ether showed a significant trend shift as it attempted to reclaim the mid-line of the 2-week Gaussian Channel, a technical indicator used to identify price trends. The Gaussian or Normal Distribution Channel plots price movements within a dynamic range, adapting to market volatility. Historically, when ETH crosses above this mid-line, significant rallies often follow. In 2023, ETH surged 93% to $4,000 after a similar crossover, while in 2020, it skyrocketed by 1,820%, sparking a massive altcoin rally. Conversely, a similar setup in August 2022 led to an invalidation during a market correction, highlighting the risks of relying solely on this indicator. Likewise, crypto trader Merlijn noted a golden cross between the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA (simple moving average), which could further strengthen an imminent ETH breakout. Related: Bitcoin fractal analysis forecasts new all-time highs above $110K by end of week Traders exercise caution ahead of possible ‘range-bound environment' Popular crypto trader XO noted that Ethereum is consolidating under a “decent” resistance level below the $2,800 mark. A contrarian outlook to bulls can also be observed with ETH prices oscillating under the Fibonacci levels. Cointelegraph reported that Ether recently retested the 0.5 to 0.618 Fib levels, which could trigger a short-term correction for ETH. In such a scenario, the immediate area of support remains around $2,150 and $1,900, possibly slowing down the bullish momentum for a prolonged period.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Publicly traded KULR, which has headquarters in Houston, now holds 800.3 tokens worth about $85 million, based on current pricing. The company bought its latest Bitcoin at an average price of $103,234 per token. Bitcoin was recently trading at roughly $106,200, up about a percentage point over the past 24 hours and more than 25% over the past month, according to crypto markets data provider CoinGecko. KULR is trading at $1.24 as of writing time, down 3% over the past 24 hours. Multiple companies have added to their Bitcoin stores in recent months amid an upturn in wider crypto markets that has dovetailed with the re-election of Donald Trump, who has been supportive of the industry. Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, now holds more than 576,000 Bitcoin worth about $61 billion based on current prices, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. The firm's strategy calls for its team to hold up to 90% of its surplus cash reserves in Bitcoin—a plan other public companies, including California-based ThumzUp Media, have emulated over the past few months. The firm's latest Bitcoin buy also comes a few days ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's highly publicized dinner with more than 200 top holders of his meme coin, Official Trump. Bitcoin was recently trading at $104,699 — less than $5,00 shy of its highest price, CoinGecko data shows. Amid that Trump-fueled crypto market rally, several public and private companies are stocking their treasuries with the world's oldest cryptocurrency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One Bitcoin trader says “price discovery” will be “inches away” if BTC bulls manage to liquidate $3 billion in short positions. An end-of-month Bitcoin price close above $102,400 would set the highest monthly close ever, proving the bull market continues at a rapid pace. Over $3 billion in Bitcoin short positions are vulnerable above $107,000, creating a “liquidation magnet” that could send BTC price to new highs. Bitcoin (BTC) is 11 days from potentially setting its highest monthly candle close in history. With respect to its current market trend, Bitcoin is inches away from a ‘price discovery' period, as noted by crypto trader Jelle. Price discovery in this context refers to the process where buyers and sellers interact at an undefined or non-traded range to determine the market price of an asset. Such a move coincides with the probability of BTC hitting new highs this month. Related: Bitcoin is signaling a golden cross — What does it mean for BTC price? Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. has noted a key technical pattern in Bitcoin's current bull cycle, pointing to three recent instances of “compression”—a period of tightening price ranges—measured by rolling maximum/minimum over 180 days. The chart indicates that this compression often signals an impending breakout, with historical precedent set by the 2017 rally when Bitcoin surged to $20,000 from $1,000. From the vantage point of Bitcoin liquidation, over $3 billion in short leveraged positions are at risk of being liquidated if BTC price moves to $110,000 from $105,000. Technical analyst Gert van Lagen noted a similar outlook, stating, Related: Bitcoin trading in six-figure territory shows BTC is ready to carry gold's ‘baton' — Fidelity exec</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation gathered in Jackson Hole on May 14 and 15 for its first meeting of the interim. The committee's next meeting will be July 10 in Casper. The commission is still prepared for a July 4 release date. Apollo described the token as a “virtual currency, representative of and redeemable for $1 U.S., held in trust by Wyoming.” Last year, the Legislature passed a bill prohibiting state agencies from requiring payment in the form of CBCDs and from using public funds to help test a CBCD, which Apollo referenced in defense of the token. “Despite that clarification and the very clear delineation between CBDC and what we're doing, we still had [Rep.] Tom Emmer (R-Minnesota), who serves as the GOP majority whip, characterize our offering as a CBDC,” said Apollo. Apollo also announced the commission is accepting public comments on proposed rules for procurement and public records requestsuntil May 27, and on proposed rules for reserves management through June 30. Alongside public comment, the stabletoken is currently in an “alpha phase” or test pilot phase, with mock tokens that currently hold no value being tested on multiple platforms. Between these two milestones, Apollo said that Wyoming was in a unique position. “If we are able to promulgate our rules set first, this will be the first rule set around stable coins in the United States of America,” said Apollo. Committee Cochair Rep. Dainel Singh (R-Cheyenne) was interested in the future of tokens, asking Apollo about tokenized real world assets. “There is interest, conversation that's being had in perhaps expanding the scope of what the stable token is able to do, [if it is] able to represent things like gold or any other commodity, such as oil or rare earth minerals.hat are your thoughts on that?” Singh asked. We've seen a large proliferation of this industry, but if I had to put my money down, I do think that real-world assets are next.” Lawmakers also spent time hearing from experts in the artificial intelligence industry and reviewing how other states are handling developments. Rep. Lee Filer (R-Cheyenne) said “it's in our communities” referring to AI. He suggested everyone in the room had at least one interaction with AI. I mean, is there a better approach to it than that, or is that the direction we're currently headed?” asked Rothfuss. Greenwood suggested workers adopt similar security measures to those of military members operating “behind enemy lines.” “But now, civilians should learn how to have a safe word, one that they do not ever tell anybody else so you can distinguish whether the entity that's called you on the phone that … sounds just like your cousin and … maybe looks like your cousin on video, that you have some last ditch way to disambiguate them.” The committee said it's interested in crafting legislation to address these concerns. Filer said he was interested in two other state legislatures' approaches to AI. One is California Senate Bill 813, which created public-private entities to oversee AI makers. Laws related to RTR can impact farmers, iPhone users and even military equipment. Lawmakers asked him if right-to-repair laws have incentivised some manufacturers to “tap out” of a market, specifically in Colorado, after the state passed RTR legislation. I think they're more interested in violating the statute and then dealing with that through legal means later than withdrawing from a market."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Société Générale's crypto arm, SG Forge, is reportedly preparing to launch a dollar-backed stablecoin on Ethereum, making it the first global banking group to issue a public stablecoin tied to the U.S. dollar. SG Forge's dollar stablecoin would be publicly accessible on Ethereum, with additional support for Solana to follow. The shift would come amid accelerating stablecoin adoption. World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance project backed by the family of U.S. President Donald Trump, has launched its own dollar-denominated stablecoin, USD1, which has been used to settle MGX's $2 billion investment in Binance. Banks, according to BitGo's managing director of stablecoin Ben Reynolds, are exploring stablecoins in a bid to avoid being outpaced by cryptocurrency-native competitors. These financial institutions are needed to unlock the full potential of these tokens, PayPal's crypto head Jose Fernandez da Ponte said at Consensus 2025 in Toronto. SG Forge's euro-denominated stablecoin, EURCV, currently has a market capitalization of around $46.5 million, far behind competitors including Circle's EURC token, whose market cap exceeds $237 million. Euro-denominated tokens represent a fraction of the $243 billion stablecoin market. Before joining CoinDesk he worked at major financial and crypto publications.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UK Information Commissioner John Edwards is on a bit of a speaking tour, having recently addressed Privacy New Zealand – a country where he spent eight years serving as privacy commissioner – and the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)'s Data Protection Intensive UK 2025. His message is a mix of human-centric thinking and a warning to services that flout the rules, guided by the principle that “data protection is not just about computers, numbers and legislation – it's about people.” Edwards tells the IAPP that “since I arrived in the UK and took up this role in 2022, my aim has been to regulate for outcomes, not outputs. I'm interested in real impact, real change, rather than products, things that might be easy to count, but that ultimately don't improve the lives or experiences of people in the UK.” He cites real scenarios in which irresponsible data handling leading to data breaches can have grave consequences: “Imagine a person fleeing a violent domestic relationship, only to have their new address accidentally shared with their abuser.” Rather than a mere “admin error”, Edwards wants to frame these mistakes within a wider social context, notably in how they impact people in vulnerable positions. He believes “the public should not be expected to have to read reams of legalese in a privacy notice to understand what's happening to their information,” that “they should not be kept in the dark about where their information's going and what it's being used for,” and that “they should not be coerced or forced into handing over their information without being fully informed about the consequences.” “Our role is to ask questions on behalf of young people, so they don't have to make complex decisions about how they transact with their personal information in an asymmetric information relationship,” Edwards says. How do their recommender systems work, how are they using a 13 year old's preferences, viewing habits, shares and likes to serve them content, and keep them on the platform? If social media and video sharing platforms want to benefit from operating in the UK, they must comply with data protection law.” “By focusing our efforts on some of the largest, most well known platforms, we are not giving smaller companies a free pass to adopt or continue unlawful practices. Instead, last week's announcement should serve as a warning shot. All organisations using children's data, or who offer products or services aimed at young people, need to comply with the law and conform with our children's code.” We'll be closely scrutinising any proposed deployment of predictive profiling that could affect people's rights.” Edwards' address to Privacy New Zealand focuses on the ICO's work in childrens' online safety. “One of the largest platforms told me that as a result of the code and our work, they made more changes to their product products than they did when the GDPR came in, and that's huge.” He cites wins like turning off geolocation for kids by default and turning off notifications after bedtime. Clearview appealed that fine and won, forcing the ICO to seek its own appeal. I‘m three and a half years into my term now; there is no chance that that matter will be determined before my term ends.” Edwards also makes brief reference to Australia's social media ban for users under 16. “I think one of the most sensible things I've heard on this subject came from a real advocate who's sometimes a pretty harsh critic of my office and  me personally, and the role that we play.” “The thing is I wonder, you know, we expect that parents will not give their children cigarettes right? But we also make it a crime for retailers to sell children under 18 cigarettes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The King of Pigs ($KOPS), built on the most robust BSC chain, has kick-started its ICO on May 17th, giving traders and cryptocurrency enthusiasts a unique investment opportunity. The referral program is one of the top features of the $KOPS ICO, making it easy for people to earn rewards by referring family or friends. Anyone investing just $25 in $KOPS will receive their reference code that can be used to invite friends. Anyone who joins the ICO using your code will earn rewards and privileges. As a result, investors can increase their share by encouraging new participants in the $KOPS ICO. It allows investors to get more value from their investments with no additional cost. By doubling the amount of tokens bought, investors benefit immediately after purchasing. The only criterion is to acquire a minimum of 1000 $KOPS. Thus, early buyers of $KOPS at the ICO will be able to reap the rewards from day one. The Creator Fund contest consists of 85,000,000 $KOPS tokens that can be won by people who submit videos, memes, threads, and more. As there are big rewards for the best entries, both amateurs and professionals are motivated to take part and create work that could bring them token prizes. Anyone can join, and suddenly sharing a successful meme could add much to an individual's $KOPS. While each $KOPS can be bought for as low as $0.001 during the ICO, many think its value will rise significantly. If $KOPS rises to $0.4, $0.6, or even $0.8, people with a big holding will collect significant returns. For instance, 5 million tokens valued at $0.8 each can profit considerably. Since the growth potential is quite strong, early $KOPS investors might discover that the value of their coins increases quickly. The $KOPS ICO is the best opportunity for those interested in cryptocurrency due to its awesome bonuses, top-class referral program, and impressive UGC contest. The $KOPS ICO provides a special way for individuals to start investing in cryptocurrency. By entering at just $0.001, enjoying many rewards and the UGC contest, joining $KOPS means becoming part of a lively community with many opportunities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Privacy concerns are no longer a side issue in crypto; they're central to user protection. Cold Wallet brings a new direction by merging zero-knowledge technology with cold-storage methods. It enables users to maintain full control over their digital activity without sacrificing accessibility, offering a seamless experience designed around confidentiality. With growing interest in DeFi tools that protect user identity, analysts suggest it holds the potential to reach 100x returns post-launch. Fixing the Hidden Privacy Flaws in Popular Wallets There's a common assumption that managing one's own keys guarantees safety. But the reality is that many widely used wallets leak sensitive data. Cold Wallet answers this with a system that mimics offline behavior even when connected. Its infrastructure leverages zero-knowledge proofs to hide user balances, blur transaction histories, and stop data leaks. It goes beyond traditional tools by ensuring both usability and advanced protection at all times. This approach makes it stand out among privacy-driven crypto launches. Its design supports real-world use with a structured system that powers essential features and user feedback-driven upgrades. Now available in stage 6 of its crypto presale at $0.00773, with a listing price planned at $0.3517, its positioning gives an advantage to early contributors who value practical applications. Participants gain input into major decisions, such as protocol upgrades and third-party integrations. Rather than serving as a placeholder, $CWT has been developed to perform key roles across the platform's operation. As adoption spreads, the expectation is that usage and demand will climb steadily. Why Cold Wallet Stands Out in the Privacy Sector Today's crypto audience is paying more attention to projects with practical use cases rather than marketing buzz. Cold Wallet's real appeal comes from its capacity to meet the needs of both everyday users and larger entities without giving up usability or protection. For high-volume traders, this means conducting activities without unwanted visibility. The development roadmap includes features like browser access, mobile apps, multi-chain connections, and business-level deployment. With its focus on privacy and real-world problem-solving, Cold Wallet positions itself as a rare example of utility-focused progress in digital finance. Cold Wallet is focused on solving a critical issue, not chasing quick volume. More importantly, its foundation in tech and usability supports long-term relevance. For those seeking a Web3 tool with real purpose and clear direction, Cold Wallet offers one of the strongest use cases currently on the rise.

Many Bitcoin analysts, including BlackRock's Larry Fink, believe that it is digital gold. In a recent white paper, BlackRock noted that Bitcoin was a unique diversifier and that many investors are buying it to hedge against growing U.S. debt. Analysts cite Bitcoin's tokenomics, a capped supply of 21 million coins and a halving mechanism that slows its issuance by cutting block rewards every four years.Bitcoin's falling supply is occurring just as institutional and government demand is rising. More disposable income could lead some people to buy Bitcoin and other altcoins. A notable example occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic when Americans used stimulus checks to purchase Bitcoin. Historically, Bitcoin has tracked the M2 money supply, albeit with a lag. Finally, the bill's tax cuts and deregulation measures could help to offset the impact of Donald Trump's tariffs and help to reduce recession risks. Falling recession risks would then be bullish for Bitcoin and other altcoins. Bitwise is still the only company that disclosed its BTC addresses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new report from Standard Chartered says sovereign entities are increasingly gaining Bitcoin exposure through shares of Strategy (MSTR), supporting the bank's $500,000 BTC target by 2029. In a new report, Standard Chartered Bank says indirect exposure via Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is quietly increasing among government entities, reinforcing the bank's long-standing price prediction that Bitcoin will reach $500,000 before President Donald Trump leaves office in 2029. “The latest 13F data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) supports our core thesis that Bitcoin (BTC) will reach the $500,000 level before Trump leaves office as it attracts a wider range of institutional buyers,” wrote Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered's global head of digital assets research. “As more investors gain access to the asset and as volatility falls, we believe portfolios will migrate towards their optimal level from an underweight starting position in BTC.” Q1 13F filings revealed a slowdown in direct bitcoin ETF buying—Wisconsin's state fund exited its entire 3,400 BTC-equivalent IBIT position—while government-linked purchases of MSTR shares were on the rise. Abu Dhabi's Mubadala, for instance, upped its IBIT exposure to 5,000 BTC equivalent, but Kendrick says the bigger story is elsewhere. “We believe that in some cases, MSTR holdings by government entities reflect a desire to gain Bitcoin exposure where local regulations do not allow direct BTC holdings,” he said. Meanwhile, Norway's Government Pension Fund, the Swiss National Bank, and South Korea's public funds each added exposure equivalent to 700 BTC. U.S. retirement funds in states like California and New York added a combined 1,000 BTC equivalent via MSTR. Last month, he admitted his prior $120K forecast for Q2 2025 was “too low,” citing surging inflows into U.S. spot BTC ETFs—totaling $5.3 billion over just three weeks. Standard Chartered's latest analysis shows that Bitcoin's role in institutional portfolios is maturing beyond tech volatility correlation—now increasingly seen as a macro hedge.</p>

Bitcoin Foundation Chairman Brock Pierce joins ‘Varney & Co.' to discuss Trump's ‘crypto strategic reserve' plan. Geno Roefaro, CEO of Florida-based SaferWatch, a security platform designed to enhance emergency response across public and private institutions, has observed a growing trend: organized crime groups are increasingly targeting individuals' cryptocurrency holdings using "sophisticated methods." Jethro Pijlman, managing director of Netherlands-based Infinite Risks International, a firm that provides physical security and intelligence services to cryptocurrency holders, told FOX Business that threats against crypto executives have noticeably increased globally since 2021. Last week, a group of men tried to attack the daughter of French crypto firm Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat on the street in Paris in broad daylight. Earlier this year, the founder of French crypto company Ledger and his wife were kidnapped. While all of them were rescued, it provoked a sense of fear and urgency among other high-net-worth individuals in the sector. Additionally, there has been a "particularly high concentration in Asia," Pijlman said. Jethro Pijlman, managing director of Netherlands-based Infinite Risks International, a firm that provides physical security and intelligence services to cryptocurrency holders, told FOX Business that threats against crypto executives have noticeably  (iStock) Coinbase revealed in a recent regulatory filing that it spent $6.2 million last year on personal security for CEO Brian Armstrong. Each cycle typically includes a euphoric phase marked by the rapid accumulation of wealth," Pijlman said, noting that "it is common for individuals to publicly display their newfound prosperity through luxury vehicles, high-end real estate, expensive watches, and other status symbols, often showcased on YouTube, Instagram, and other social media platforms." Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong speaks at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, on May 2, 2022. Last fall, for instance, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun purchased Maurizio Cattelan's famed banana duct-taped to a wall artwork for $6.2 million. "Unfortunately, this public exposure often occurs without adequate awareness of personal security risks," Pijlman said, adding that "many individuals unintentionally share sensitive information online." This includes travel itineraries, attendance at industry events or meetups, photos of luxury vehicles with visible license plates, identifiable backgrounds and real-time videos from upscale restaurants, clubs or private gatherings. Even posts or tags by friends can unintentionally reveal their location, according to Pijlman. It is not uncommon for such groups to monitor a target's digital footprint for weeks or even months before executing a robbery or abduction. The level of detail available through open-source intelligence is often staggering," he added. This includes real-time alerts when oversharing occurs and helping clients adjust their online behavior to reduce exposure. The firm's transportation services are delivered exclusively by security-trained drivers. In most major cities throughout Europe and the United States, the firm deploys executive protection agents, often with government or military backgrounds, who specialize in minimizing personal risk during client movements. It also offers residential security solutions, including armed protection. Roefaro told FOX Business that the rapid rise in cryptocurrency wealth has added a new layer of complexity to executive protection. In most major cities throughout Europe and the U.S., Infinite Risks International deploys executive protection agents, often with government or military backgrounds, who specialize in minimizing personal risk during client movements. "As digital fortunes grow, so does the risk of targeted attacks. "It's a clear indication that personal security must evolve in tandem with financial innovation." Roefaro's company, which created a discrete device to help executives, other employees and their families get help without drawing any attention, also has a client in the cryptocurrency space. It is also hard for victims to recover from the losses because they transfer them internationally, Roefaro said. "This ‘golden egg' represents a fundamental vulnerability, as there are no built-in safeguards to mitigate the risk it poses. Insiders – such as system administrators or software developers at cryptocurrency firms – can potentially siphon funds undetected, leaving businesses exposed to significant financial losses with little recourse or accountability," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leading coin Bitcoin briefly soared above the $107,000 mark yesterday. Although the leading cryptocurrency has since retreated slightly to $104,976 at press time, market sentiment remains firmly bullish, with on-chain indicators suggesting continued upward momentum. According to data from Blockchain Center, the cryptocurrency market remains deep in “Bitcoin Season,” a period when BTC significantly outperforms the broader altcoin market. Since plunging to a two-month low of 61.89% on May 16, BTC.D, a metric that tracks BTC's share of total crypto market capitalization, has climbed steadily. As of this writing, the metric stands at 63.92%. Interestingly, since May 14, TOTAL2, which measures the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding BTC, has trended downward. Currently standing at $1.18 trillion, it has plunged $83 billion over the past week. This divergence suggests market participants are increasingly reallocating capital into BTC over altcoins. When an asset's DMI is set up this way, it indicates that bullish momentum is stronger than bearish momentum. This signals a prevailing uptrend and buying pressure in the BTC market. If this continues, its price could attempt to breach the resistance at $107,048, and rally toward its all-time high of $109,588. On the other hand, if sell-offs strengthen, BTC's price could dip to $102,080.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HOUSTON, May  20, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KULR Technology Group, Inc. (NYSE American: KULR) (the "Company" or "KULR"), a global leader in sustainable energy management, today announced it has increased its bitcoin acquisitions for its Bitcoin Treasury by an additional $9 million to reach a total of $78 million in bitcoin acquisitions. This strategic move aligns with KULR's Bitcoin Treasury Strategy announced on December 4, 2024, wherein the Company committed up to 90% of its surplus cash reserves to be held in bitcoin. Year to date, KULR has achieved a BTC Yield of 220.2%, leveraging a combination of surplus cash and its At-The-Market (ATM) equity program to fund acquisitions. KULR uses "BTC Yield" as a key performance indicator (KPI) for its Bitcoin Treasury strategy. BTC Yield is intended to provide insights into KULR's bitcoin acquisition strategy but should not be interpreted as a measure of operating performance, financial return, or liquidity. The trading price of KULR's common stock is influenced by multiple factors beyond bitcoin holdings, and BTC Yield does not predict or reflect the stock's market value. Investors should consider this metric as a supplementary tool and refer to the Company's financial statements and SEC filings for additional information about the Company's financial position. The Company's holistic offering allows delivery of commercial-off-the-shelf and custom next generation energy storage systems in rapid timelines for a fraction of the cost compared to traditional programs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, attention is shifting toward emerging tokens that combine real-world applications with strong community interest. These altcoins are gaining momentum across trading platforms, forums, and early-stage presales. Many of the most talked-about projects today are not just about hype. They're blending technologies like artificial intelligence, smart contracts, and utility-driven use cases that go beyond speculation. One presale making waves is Dawgz AI, a meme-inspired Ethereum token designed around AI-powered tools and community interactions. Some support smart contracts while others focus on DeFi, storage, or AI-based tools. As markets look beyond BTC's long-standing dominance, altcoins are drawing interest from investors who want exposure to more functional crypto ecosystems. These tokens now represent a growing share of volume across major platforms like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, with many showing sharp price swings ahead of market cycles. One of the main reasons altcoins are being watched in 2025 is their potential to move faster than BTC. Many of them carry smaller market caps, which means even modest demand can spark noticeable gains. Altcoins that offer strong use cases, active development, and early-stage access through presales are being tracked closely by investors. The growth in altcoin interest is also tied to how these coins function. Some tokens power blockchains while others support decentralized apps or transaction models. The market is shifting toward altcoins that give real value through community interaction, AI features, or staking functions. Forbes shows that the global crypto market is expected to reach over 1.7 billion users by 2030. Many investors believe now is the time to look past Bitcoin and find tokens that offer more than storage of value. Meme coins often draw attention for their viral appeal, but many fade due to weak fundamentals. A shift is happening in 2025 as investors begin to watch meme-based tokens that also provide real use cases. Some of these projects are combining community energy with tech-driven features that go beyond memes alone. Dawgz AI recently passed a full audit by SolidProof, which improves transparency for early investors. The token aims to introduce real features like AI meme generation and automated sentiment tools that reflect market trends. These use cases, combined with a strong presale performance, are pushing Dawgz AI into discussions about altcoins to buy in 2025. Bitcoin remains a critical part of the market despite increasing focus on smaller altcoins. Many investors view it as a stabilizer that has value when other assets dip. These developments make it a key component of most long-term portfolios, even for investors who also explore newer tokens. Solana is one of the most discussed blockchains due to its fast transactions and low costs. Its focus on scalability has attracted developers, especially in DeFi and gaming, where fast performance is critical. The network continues to grow with more integrations and partnerships entering its ecosystem. Solana is currently priced at $167.05, with a market cap of around $86.86 billion as reported by Binance. It has shown resilience after network outages in previous years, gaining back trust through upgrades and sustained uptime. The DefiLlama platform shows that Solana's total value locked (TVL) is increasing, pointing to deeper utility and long-term developer confidence. While it may not carry the same meme appeal as newer presales, its real-world traction and developer interest make it one of the altcoins to buy when considering long-term utility in 2025. Arbitrum brings Layer 2 scaling to Ethereum by allowing faster and cheaper transactions through rollup technology. As the demand for scalable smart contracts rises, Arbitrum is positioned to support a new wave of dApps. ARB is trading at $0.3873, with a market cap of approximately $1.88 billion, based on Binance data. Unlike Layer 1 competitors, Arbitrum does not compete with Ethereum but helps support its growth. Unlike launched projects, presales often offer lower prices, early access bonuses, and closer engagement with the team. This model allows investors to track early momentum, tokenomics, and marketing strategies before making larger commitments. Recent data shows that investors have poured over $1 billion into presale crypto projects since late 2023, according to Cointelegraph. Dawgz AI stands out in this space by combining AI-based functionality with meme coin branding, a pairing that reflects where demand is heading. So far, Dawgz AI has raised over $3.6 million, with early investors noting its smart contract audit and utility roadmap as key reasons for interest. Presales like Dawgz AI appeal to those who follow community growth and emerging trends. The best projects in this category often balance creativity with utility, and Dawgz AI is doing that through AI integration, a defined roadmap, and clear tokenomics. Investors who plan to hold for the next few years are paying closer attention to how a project works rather than how fast its price moves. As 2025 approaches, the altcoins with growing traction are those offering real-world tools, smart contract upgrades, and functional utility in Web3 or DeFi. Crypto enthusiasts are also paying attention to the teams behind these tokens and whether they've shared measurable milestones. Traders looking for the best altcoins to buy now are not just chasing trends. They're studying presales like Dawgz AI that combine early-stage entry with long-term vision. They're also diversifying with large-cap tokens like Bitcoin and Solana, which continue to show market influence. In 2025, they are becoming a starting point for tokens built on actual use cases, not just clever branding. If you're researching altcoins with potential beyond the surface, it may be worth taking a closer look at Dawgz AI. The best altcoins in 2025 are those combining strong utility, growing communities, and developer activity. Projects like Dawgz AI, which offer real features and transparent roadmaps, are gaining early traction among long-term investors. Yes, meme coins remain active in the market, especially when paired with real functionality. Dawgz AI is one example that blends meme culture with AI-powered tools to attract both traders and community supporters. Analysts often consider token utility, market cap, trading volume, and development milestones when assessing altcoin growth. Tokens like Dawgz AI, which offer both functional use and active presale interest, fit the current trend investors are tracking. Dawgz AI meets many of these criteria and has already raised over $3.6 million during its early phase.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thunderstorms, some strong early, then cloudy skies after midnight. Damaging winds, large hail and possibly a tornado with some storms. SINGAPORE, May 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As mid-May unfolds, crypto market sentiment continues to rise. While major assets trend steadily upward, capital is beginning to rotate into fundamentally solid altcoins. In this edition of HTX DeepThink, Chloe (@ChloeTalk1) from HTX Research shares her macro outlook and strategic insights, with a spotlight on rotation opportunities across the SUI ecosystem and the emerging AttentionFi sector. Macro Outlook: Rising Bullish Sentiment Amidst Steady Short-Term Uptrend This week's U.S. economic calendar is light on major data releases. Market attention is primarily directed towards Federal Reserve officials' interpretations of recent commentary suggesting a possible single interest rate cut in 2025. Analysis of options market data shows a prevailing bullish sentiment: the Call/Put open interest ratio has reached 1.55, accompanied by increasing premiums for call options. At the same time, short-term implied volatility (IV) has dropped to a new 18-month low of 35–40%. In short: the market is experiencing "euphoric sentiment amid calm volatility." Strategic Positioning: Capital Rotation into High-Quality Altcoins for Momentum Capture From a capital allocation perspective, rotating a portion of capital into fundamentally strong and liquid altcoins may present an opportunity to capitalize on potential spillover momentum from Bitcoin's upward trajectory. SUI Ecosystem: All-Time High Market Cap, Undervalued Core Project The SUI chain has reached an all-time high in market cap, but its ecosystem projects have yet to follow with substantial gains. This opens a window for early positioning in undervalued ecosystem leaders. HTX has listed two standout projects within the SUI ecosystem: Haedal and Bluefin. Given the rising attention on SUI's mainnet, Haedal and Bluefin appear to exhibit dual potential for valuation recovery and Beta-driven upside, which may warrant mid-term attention from market participants. New Web3 projects are launching rapidly, and the cost of user acquisition is soaring. In traditional channels like Telegram, Google, or Red Note, user acquisition cost (UAC) is calculated via "traffic × conversion rate." With CPCs at $0.5–1.0 and conversion rates around 10%, it can cost $5–10 to acquire a real, retained user. Its API charges based on a combination of reputation score and meaningful engagement. As a result, project teams can acquire real users with 3–4x higher retention at just $2–3 per user—much lower than traditional channels. With this model, Kaito has grown rapidly, expanding from 30 to 120 integrated projects in the past three months, and quadrupling API call volume. Several recent IDOs have seen 10–30x returns on day one, forming a lucrative loop: stake → points → arbitrage. With the recent listing of $KAITO on HTX, its liquidity is expanding—and in a bull market where competition for user attention intensifies, Kaito's combination of low-cost, high-precision targeting and deflationary tokenomics makes it a promising asset to watch. *The above content  is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With Bitcoin (BTC) securing its spot as the largest crypto asset by market cap, Ethereum (ETH) has also maintained the second spot for years. However, this dominance for first and second positions was not always the case. Notably, while BTC has always remained the largest asset, the position of the second-largest cryptocurrency was once a constant battle between XRP and Ethereum, with both assets occasionally retaking and relinquishing this position for years. XRP maintained this spot, with Litecoin unable to catch up, until Ethereum outranked it in February 2016. CoinMarketCap's historical snapshot confirms that Ethereum soared to a market cap of $358.3 million in late February 2016, while XRP had a valuation of $276 million. However, things changed in December 2017 on the back of XRP's meteoric run. By December 31, 2017, XRP boasted a market cap of $89.12 billion, holding the second spot, while Ethereum, which had a market cap of $73.17 billion, was relegated to third. Nonetheless, as XRP witnessed a massive correction, Ethereum retook the second spot. This battle slipped into 2019 and 2020, but Ethereum mostly maintained the second spot. However, following the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, XRP collapsed further, even relegating the third spot and slipping to as low as seventh in February 2021. Even in October 2024, XRP languished in the seventh spot, with a market cap of $29.3 billion, ten times less than Ethereum's market cap of $301.7 billion at the time. Interestingly, due to its greater resilience amid the market-wide bearish pressure that began in February 2025, XRP is now closer to overtaking Ethereum than it has been in years. This would require a 122% increase from the current price of $2.36. With the SEC lawsuit now heading toward a definitive settlement, most believe XRP could eventually retake the second spot if it maintains its growth momentum.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — The Senate advanced a major cryptocurrency regulation bill Monday on a bipartisan vote two weeks after every Senate Democrat united to block it. Democratic support to proceed with the legislation was unlocked after a group of bipartisan negotiators — Sens. ; and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz. — reached an agreement late last week on an amendment to the bill that addressed key sticking points for Democrats. The amendment, which Democratic negotiators circulated over the weekend and has been obtained by NBC News, includes new changes to consumer protection safeguards and limits on tech companies issuing stablecoins, and it would extend ethics standards to special government employees — which would temporarily apply to Elon Musk and tech entrepreneur David Sacks. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri — blocked the bill from advancing, demanding stronger national security and anti-money laundering provisions. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., criticized his colleagues across the aisle for delaying the vote, pointing out that no changes have been made to the underlying bill that Democrats blocked two weeks ago. The Trump family's crypto dealings with World Liberty Financial, and President Donald Trump's dinner for the top holders of his meme coin, have aggravated concerns among Democrats. But no provisions in the negotiated amendment would prohibit Trump and his family from continuing their crypto ventures. The bill text includes a provision that would “prohibit any member of Congress or senior executive branch official from issuing a payment stablecoin product during their time in public service.” Some Democrats have argued it needs to be stronger. “Congress should not choose to enable the president's egregious corruption.” Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., for example, plans to offer legislation called the STABLE Act, which would prevent elected officials and federal candidates from issuing or endorsing digital assets, as an amendment to the GENIUS Act. Democrats are expected to force votes on those bills this week, but they are unlikely to go anywhere in the GOP-controlled chamber. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., convened a caucus-wide call Sunday night to discuss the GENIUS Act. While some Democrats like Warren said they can't vote for the bill without stronger provisions that limit Trump's profiting from digital assets, others, like Warner, argued that Congress can no longer sit on the sidelines of the evolving cryptocurrency space. “Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family's use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” Warner, who voted to advance the GENIUS Act, wrote in a statement Monday. If American lawmakers don't shape it, others will — and not in ways that serve our interests or democratic values,” he added. Cryptocurrency advocates argue that Congress should also pass legislation to determine regulatory treatment of digital assets and digital asset securities. “The winners, if Congress passes this bill, are Americans who want to make payments faster and easier to access,” said Kara Calvert, the vice president for public policy at Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange. “It's transformational technology, so passing this bill is a win for them.
