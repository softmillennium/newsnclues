                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Damien Chazelle's next film looks to have its sights sets on some serious star power as Deadline is hearing Cillian Murphy and Daniel Craig are in negotiations to star in the new, currently untitled pic from the Oscar-winning director. Chazelle will direct and has written the script and will also produce alongside Olivia Hamilton under their Wild Chickens Productions banner. While unconfirmed, insiders say the film will be set in a prison. If deals end up closing for the two stars, production is expected to start later this year. Chazelle had been weighing several projects in recent months including an Evel Knievel pic with Leonardo DiCaprio circling the lead role. With the studio unable to make a deal for DiCaprio, Chazelle circled back to the prison drama as his next film. LA Screenings 2025: Buyers & Sellers Seek Unity Amid Noise Of Mergers & Trump Tariffs As with any Chazelle feature, A-list talent is always circling given his track record; this case was no different, with Murphy and Craig high on the project following a meeting with Chazelle. Murphy is coming off his Oscar-winning role in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer. He recently wrapped production on the Peaky Binders movie The Immortal Man at Netflix and was also recently seen in Small Things Like These. Craig was most recently seen in the A24 pic Queer, which earned him a Golden Globe nomination. Next up, he is set to reprise his role as Benoit Blanc in the upcoming Knives Out sequel Wake Up Dead Man, which will bow later this year on Netflix.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If longtime HGTV star Alison Victoria has her way, she'll “live forever and look damn good doing it.” That's what Victoria, 44, told Chicago Magazine in late April 2025, sharing multiple ways she's been working on improving her health and prioritizing her happiness. One big decision the “Windy City Rehab” star and current contestant on “Rock The Block” made in 2024 was to cut all alcohol out of her diet. “That's the biggest reason I gave up alcohol eight months ago. You know, some people use all the best lotions but drink a gallon of wine a night, and they look like hell. Beauty, health, and wellness all start from within.” At her homes there and in Chicago, she's installed her own Lagree M3 Megaformers, Pilates workout machines that cost nearly $7,000 each. I've got big gumballs in my gym, and I shove a couple of those in for a sugar rush. Victoria has a sweet tooth, so she washed down all of her vitamins with a favorite brownie batter flavored FlavCity protein shake — and adds some BeautyLux Multi Collagen powder. When she's filming, Victoria told Chicago Magazine, she has “roasted red pepper egg white bites,” but nothing else for breakfast or lunch. Most nights, she said, she eats a wagyu rib eye steak with “salt, pepper, a little bit of butter, and rosemary.” “I make a little salad with romaine lettuce and garbanzo beans,” she added, but admitted to satisfy her sweet tooth, she always has candy on hand. “I also love candy so much,” she told the magazine. Adding to Victoria's health and happiness is her relationship with filmmaker Brandt Andersen. Victoria went Instagram official with Andersen in June 2024, sharing multiple photos of them together at the Daytime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles. In November, she told Entertainment Tonight, “I've never felt, like, more safe. And that just is something I never have felt in my life. And it's like I don't have to wear that armor with him. And I get to just be, like, my authentic, vulnerable, scared-little-girl self with him and he takes care of me.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last year, the public heat around Chappell Roan intensified after she posted a series of TikToks hoping to clarify her stance on the presidential election after an interview quote was taken widely out of context. Each new video only gave viewers more to nitpick over. Some questioned why Roan wouldn't just let it go. People just assume you're the villain,” Roan said. The first intense wave of backlash came this past August when she set boundaries around her private and public personas. She was, in turn, slammed for being entitled and ungrateful. On Outlaws, she likened the response to how Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and Paris Hilton were treated. Billy Corgan on Why He Formed a New Band to Play Smashing Pumpkins Deep Cuts Josh Freese Theorizes Foo Fighters Firing: Constantly Whistling ‘My Hero,' Owning Too Many Poodles 'The Republic Is Under Siege By a Moron': Everything Bruce Springsteen Has Said About Trump Roan referenced the popular X account Pop Crave, which posts the latest happenings in pop culture and often shares pull quotes from interviews published by established outlets, in a game of “Ban it, Bitch!” with Outlaws. Quite a few of the public's online fallouts with the singer began with posts from Pop Crave. It's not necessarily that the account itself is framing her in a bad light. Rather, it presents quotes that can be easily misconstrued without necessary context and allows users to have a field day in its quotes and comments sections like a pop star gladiator colosseum. This treatment has followed Roan offline before, too. She's called out photographers on red carpets for yelling at her on more than one occasion, only to later be called a brat and a villain online. “I've been treated better at my doughnut shop job than I have on a fucking carpet,” Roan said. “People on the news treat me worse than how customers did.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lanez was the victim of a prison stabbing last week. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida's 13th district is calling for Tory Lanez's freedom. Gavin Newsom to review the Toronto singer's 2020 shooting case and issue Lanez (born Daystar Peterson) a pardon in a message posted to X on Monday (May 19). Newsom @CAgovernor to review Tory Lanez's case and issue a pardon,” she wrote. “His 10-year sentence was based on flawed evidence, political pressure, and prosecutorial bias. Lanez is currently serving a 10-year sentence after being convicted on three felony counts tied to shooting Megan Thee Stallion in the feet following a July 2020 party in Hidden Hills, Calif. Rep. Luna has also claimed via X on Tuesday (May 20) that new “compelling evidence” will be presented in the next 36 hours, which she believes will exonerate Lanez. “We have compelling evidence proving Tory Lanez's innocence, and it will be released within the next 36 hours,” she wrote. Reps for Lanez from the Los Angeles nonprofit social justice organization Unite the People presented alleged new findings in Tory's case during a press conference last week. Attorney Walter Roberts claimed that Kelsey Harris' bodyguard, Bradley James, filed an affidavit claiming he overheard Harris admit to firing the weapon and not Lanez. Megan Thee Stallion's attorney, Alex Spiro, released a statement refuting Roberts' claims. “Tory Lanez was tried and convicted by a jury of his peers and his case was properly adjudicated through the court system,” he said. “Ain't no new f–king evidence yall been saying the same s–t for years.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

Darren Aronofsky has launched a new generative AI storytelling venture in which he will partner with Google DeepMind to produce short films with Gen-AI and some of Google's newly announced tools. Later technological breakthroughs — sound, color, VFX — allowed us to tell stories in ways that couldn't be told before. Now is the moment to explore these new tools and shape them for the future of storytelling,” Aronofsky said in an official statement. Related Stories Google Unveils Gen-AI Video Tool with Camera Controls, Consistent Character Design, and Even Sound The Cannes 2025 Films So Far Most Likely to End Up in the Oscar Race The news was announced alongside Google's I/O event, in which the tech giant also unveiled its latest generative video model called Veo 3, as well as an advanced new gen-AI editing tool called Flow. Google DeepMind will provide Primordial Soup's team early access to these tools. Her film will premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on June 13, and it will be followed by a panel featuring the filmmakers and moderated by Aronofsky. The film blends live-action filmmaking and performance with generative visuals and is described as a deeply personal narrative inspired by the day McNitt was born. McNitt trained the AI models on her own baby pictures and other photos taken by her late father in order to generate a newborn infant with a story that could be shaped by her own biography. “With ‘Ancestra,' I was able to visualize the unseen, transforming family archives, emotions, and science into a cinematic experience that feels both intimate and expansive,” said McNitt. McNitt is known for a previous VR experience that was executive produced by Aronofsky that featured the voices of Millie Bobby Brown, Jessica Chastain, and Patti Smith as the voices of the cosmos. It was the first VR project to ever be acquired out of Sundance. Two additional films, yet to be announced, will explore other new applications of Veo, Google DeepMind's video generation model.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Generative AI filmmaker Dave Clark has tried “every tool under the sun” for making his artificially intelligent movies, most famously for his viral short “Battalion.” But even in the year since he released that video, the technology around Gen-AI has advanced considerably, and he believes that what was considered innovative back then can now be pushed even further. Clark was one of the AI filmmakers who collaborated with Google Labs on the functionality and interface of the new tool such that it was designed with filmmakers and creators in mind. Suffice it to say, he's impressed by the results. Related Stories Christian Petzold on His Cannes Debut and How His Actors Changed the Script: ‘I Have to Destroy My Own Concrete Behavior' Quentin Tarantino Inks ‘Making of' Book Deal Series for All of His Films, Starting with ‘Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' But all we really hope for is that level of control that I feel like we finally got some sense of it, and it's a long time coming for being so early in it.” Flow has camera controls that allow filmmakers to specifically articulate the movement and visual angle they want to create for a shot as though they're directing a cinematographer. Creators can upload and combine multiple reference images that will match things like faces, clothing, and locations, doing so with hyper-specific detail. Flow also allows for more natural language in prompt writing, such that it understands visual language of screenwriting and granular technical details like lens choices, lighting conditions, focal lengths, or film grain. It's even capable of generating sound in real time with the video generation, including sound effects, background music, and dialogue. Clark and his AI production banner Promise are using Flow to create a new AI-generated short called “Freelancers” about two adopted brothers who each, through separate paths, become international spies and hitmen. He then prompted the model to use a dynamic, handheld camera motion, followed by a tracking shot of the two characters running. To see the way that the camera was shaking, it's this exact same way I would probably film it if I was in that restaurant. It was pretty cool, and I haven't seen that level of [control],” Clark said. It wasn't that long ago that OpenAI unveiled its Sora video model; AI filmmakers we spoke to then were stunned that it had “prompt adherence,” where you can articulate one thing to happen and then have something else happen to that figure within the same sequence. Flow and Veo 3 demonstrated an even more advanced capability, in which a scene creators have generated can then be dragged and extended on a timeline to effectively continue the action and even lengthen the duration of an individual shot beyond the 6 – 8 seconds the model would normally generate. It's able to translate that information into the next cut or scene or edit, if you will, and continue on that narrative.” Clark said he got as specific as articulating the scene to look as though it was shot with a 50mm lens all the way up to a 135mm long lens, and Flow not only understands, but can then marry that work with specific blocking. Matthieu Kim Lorrain, Creative Lead at Google DeepMind, and Thomas Iljic, Product Lead at Google Labs, spoke with IndieWire about understanding someone like Clark's creative process in order to inform how Flow should operate, and they were stunned by what he and others were able to create with what they thought was, at the time, bare-bones functionality. They don't want just to type text,” Iljic said. You want to really curate the perfect image and then expand,” Lorrain said. And in the case of world-building, that's why we have the ingredients so you can define your characters, find your environment, and they want that. Clark's Promise earlier today announced additional funding from Google's AI Future Fund, as well as Crossbeam Venture Partners, Kivu Ventures, and Saga Ventures. But Google is also partnering with two other filmmakers on the launch of Flow, including Henry Daubrez and Junie Lau. Flow is also available now to subscribers of Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra plans in the U.S., with more countries coming soon. Clark isn't sure what the specific next frontier is with the rapidly evolving technology, but he does believe that as the tools become more accessible, it's incumbent on creators to at least understand it. “I always reference the James Camerons and the George Lucases, some of the top filmmakers were always technologists, and I feel like we're going to see that next level, that next school of George Lucas, that are going to be inherently technologists,” Clark said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Early Monday morning, when much of the White House press corps was fast asleep, President Donald Trump demanded the federal government conduct a “major investigation” into singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen, a Trump critic, and his presidential endorsement last year. On Friday, the sitting American president had already warned Springsteen that he “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT,” and “we'll all see how it goes for him” once the rock star is back home in the United States. Springsteen failed to comply, and spoke out once again about the “unfit” president at a concert in Manchester, England, on Saturday. “Things are happening right now that are altering the very nature of our country's democracy, and they're too important to ignore,” he said. Those comments led to a new wave of baseless threats from Trump against Springsteen and two more prominent celebrities who endorsed Kamala Harris in 2024, Beyoncé and Oprah Winfrey. There are numerous scandals, authoritarian power grabs, and moral abominations being carried out by the second Trump administration, largely in plain sight. The twice-impeached, repeatedly indicted president thrives on attention, so it may feel easy to dismiss Trump's latest celeb-obsessed outburst as a mere temper tantrum or even a distraction. Trump's crusade against the First Amendment and free expression dates back to at least his first four years in the White House, and his 2016 presidential campaign. And Trump's recurring threat against “The Boss” is yet another front in his second administration's larger scorched-earth campaign against free speech and democratic values in this country. “Accountability for a class of people who act as if they're above the law may be uncomfortable for Rolling Stone, but it's refreshing to the American people,” says Trump White House spokesperson Harrison Fields. According to three sources familiar with the matter, Trump has repeatedly vented to close associates, both before and after his 2024 election victory, about using the Justice Department, Federal Communications Commission, FEC, and other government organs to crack down on (in his incorrect characterization) the “illegal” campaign finance violations made by Democratic-aligned celebrities, including late-night talk show hosts, and other liberals. ISN'T THAT A MAJOR AND ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION? “Candidates aren't allowed to pay for ENDORSEMENTS, which is what Kamala did, under the guise of paying for entertainment … IT'S NOT LEGAL! Trump's legal theory here is wrong — he effectively has the situation backwards. Harris did not pay Beyoncé, Winfrey, or Springsteen for their endorsements. The candidate, in reality, made payments to their production companies for services rendered, as is legally required. The Harris campaign paid $165,000 in November to Beyoncé's production company, Parkwood Production Media, after she appeared at a Harris rally in Houston. Some of these lawyers and operatives, the sources add, now work in Trump's government. The president also apparently believes that a late-night comedian telling a mean joke about him might constitute an illegal in-kind political contribution to his opponents. When Trump would do those things during his first term in office, some of his key officials would roll their eyes and laugh it off, then wait for him to move on or forget about it. Today, President Trump is surrounded by senior personnel whose primary job qualification is that they will dutifully explore and execute on his most fascistic, corrupt, and nonsensical demands. One reason that Trump continues to be fixated on weaponizing campaign finance laws against his political and cultural enemies, such as the “Thunder Road” songwriter, is rather simple: revenge. According to those who've spoken to Trump in recent months about this, the president still hasn't gotten over the fact that he was implicated — first by federal prosecutors in 2018, then by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in 2023 — as the ringleader in a conspiracy to break campaign finance laws and deliver hush-money payments to women, including most famously adult film star Stormy Daniels. Within the past several months, the president has privately grumbled that if prosecutors could use the (as he's at times called it) “bullshit” campaign-finance-related claim against him, there is no reason it shouldn't be applied to certain famous entertainers, TV and news personalities, Democratic figures, and other targets, two sources who've spoken to Trump about this matter say. “Democrats pretended to care about campaign finance violations when they persecuted President Trump with their lawfare,” Mike Davis, a conservative lawyer close to Trump who is a key player of the MAGA legal elite, tells Rolling Stone. “Maybe they shouldn't have thrown stones in glass houses. It would be much easier to shrug off Trump's menacing of Springsteen if only Trump's new administration hadn't already demonstrated a gleeful willingness to throw people in jail only because they voiced an opinion or wrote an op-ed. As Team Trump knows full well, it is almost beside the point whether or not the Trump administration ever launches a formal investigation of Springsteen or his absolutely legal endorsement of then-Vice President Harris. During his 2024 reelection bid, Trump vowed to the voters that he would exact “retribution” from the Oval Office, and that his enemies, real and imagined, would suffer, either because they tried to hold him accountable for his various alleged crimes or because they pissed him off. At times, Trump tried to vaguely downplay his explicit promises, and defaulted to a talking point that policy and economic “success” would be his retribution. In early January, prior to Trump's second inauguration in Washington, D.C., celebrity lawyer Alan Dershowitz spoke at a screening, hosted at Trump's private Florida club and estate of Mar-a-Lago, of a documentary about John Eastman, an attorney who aided Trump's efforts to cling to power and overturn the 2020 election results. Dershowitz, a self-described liberal Democrat who was part of Trump's defense team during his first impeachment, tells Rolling Stone that as he delivered his remarks at the event, he noticed the then-president-elect sitting in the audience.

Elizabeth Banks portrayed an older version of Effie in the series' first four films that kicked off with The Hunger Games hitting theaters in 2012. Ralph Fiennes to Play President Snow in 'Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping' (Exclusive) Previously announced castmembers include Zada, Whitney Peak, Mckenna Grace, Jesse Plemons, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Maya Hawke, Lili Taylor and Ben Wang. THR's exclusive reporting has included the recent news that Ralph Fiennes has been cast as the diabolical President Snow and that Molly McCann and Iona Bell will portray standout book characters Louella and Lou Lou, respectively. “Elizabeth Banks made her iconic — so who could honor that legacy while bringing us back to Effie's early, most formative days? She has a rare presence — warm, sparkling and layered with extraordinary depth. The odds, it turns out, were in our favor.” Lawrence helms the movie from a script by Billy Ray that adapts Collins' book. Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson produce for Color Force, while Cameron MacConomy executive produces. Meredith Wieck and Scott O'Brien oversee Sunrise on the Reaping for Lionsgate. Fanning's recent credits include last year's Oscar-nominated feature A Complete Unknown and Joachim Trier's Sentimental Value, premiering at Cannes this week. She can be seen in such forthcoming projects as the Apple TV+ series Margo's Got Money Troubles and 20th Century's fall movie Predator: Badlands. The actress is represented by UTA, TFC Management and Hansen Jacobson. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disney's insatiable quest to mine its own IP continues with this live-action remake of an animated film that premiered a mere 23 years ago. But hey, that's enough time for a new generation of potential fans to be born while tapping into the nostalgia of those who grew up watching not only the original movie but also its three direct-to-video sequels and three television series. Creatively, there's no real reason for this version of Lilo & Stitch to exist, especially since the film's version of Stitch is necessarily animated as well. But commercially, that's a whole different matter, assuming Trump's tariffs don't prevent toy stores from being fully stocked with the plush toy version that will be on many children's wish list for Santa. Release date: Friday, May 23Cast: Sydney Elizabeth Agudong, Billy Magnussen, Tia Carrere, Hannah Waddingham, Chris Sanders, Courtney B. Vance, Zach Galifianakis, Maia KealohaDirector: Dean Fleischer CampScreenwriters: Chris Kekaniokalani Bright, Mike Van Waes That's where we're introduced to Stitch (voiced by Chris Sanders, reprising his role from the original), a destruction-loving, genetically engineered creature created by mad scientist Dr. Jumba Jookiba (Zach Galifianakis). Shortly after arriving, the duo manage to assume human form, providing the opportunity for the two actors to showcase their considerable physical comedy skills as their characters awkwardly adapt to their new bodies. Meanwhile, the koala-like, very blue Stitch winds up in an animal shelter, where he's surprisingly mistaken for a dog (one of the film's running gags) and gets adopted by Lilo. But their bond continues to deepen as she teaches him that, wait for it, “Ohana means family.” But younger viewers should eat it all up, and those weaned on the original film will appreciate the numerous shout-outs, including supporting turns by Tia Carrere, who voiced Nani in the original, and Jason Scott Lee, who voiced Nani's surfer friend David (here played by Kaipo Dudoit). There are several new characters as well, such as David's feisty grandmother (an amusing Amy Hill, another veteran of the franchise) and Cobra Bubbles (Courtney B. Vance), a federal agent attempting to track down Stitch. In both incarnations, Lilo & Stitch is not in the first rank of Disney family films, as evidenced by the fact that this remake was originally slated to go direct-to-streaming.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE:  SP Media Group, a production and entertainment company led by veteran producer and Special Advisor to Hollywood Ambassador Jon Voight, has acquired Avenue Six Studios, a production facility in Van Nuys, CA. Deadline first told you this was in the works earlier this month and part of SP Media's plans to boost local Hollywood shoots following their U.S. film and TV production incentive proposal to the President Donald Trump White House. Founded by Paul Reitzen in 2009, the studio features four fully equipped sound stages, a backlot modeled after a New York City street, and has produced numerous films, commercials, and television shows, including talk shows for Oprah Winfrey and Marie Osmond. Democratic Senators Warn Paramount's Shari Redstone That Trump Lawsuit Settlement May Violate Federal Bribery Statute 'The Daily Show's Jon Stewart Mocks Media Praising Trump For "Not Taking Cancer's Side" In Biden Statement “We're committed to making films in Hollywood and making Avenue Six Studios the most producer-friendly studio for filmmakers from around the world,” Paul tells Deadline. “I currently have three productions slated for the studio this year and look forward to welcoming more projects to take advantage of its production capabilities.” “The studios will be used primarily for film and television production, while its smaller sound stages will be used for branded content, music videos, photography, social media campaigns, podcasts, workshops, and industry events.” Future developments to the facility will include the integration of an LED virtual production stage to create immersive visual environments in real time, and a post-production facility, including editing suites and audio facilities, to offer a full-service, end-to-end production environment. This acquisition follows the successful relaunch of Atlas Comics, which under Paul's leadership is developing a slate of film and TV properties, led by the upcoming live-action feature Devilina in partnership with Paramount Pictures. “Avenue Six has always stood apart as a certified stage, saving clients time and money by eliminating permit requirements,” said Reitzin, founder of Avenue Six Studios. Paul has recently collaborated with Voight on several movies, including Man with No Past, High Ground, and The Last Gunfight, and has several new titles now in development or production. Recently, Hollywood union leaders and reps of major studios team with Voight in a letter to Trump calling for expanded film and TV production incentives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The track will follow April's "What Was That." After speaking out for the first time about her newfound gender identity leading up to new album Virgin, Lorde has announced that the project's next single will be “Man of the Year,” a track about embracing her own masculinity. “The song I'm proudest of on Virgin,” Lorde added. The New Zealand native previously released “What Was That” in April, debuting at No. In her Rolling Stone cover story from earlier in May, Lorde opened up about writing “Man of the Year” after stopping her birth control and realizing that her gender felt more fluid than she previously realized. Just before penning the track, she taped her own chest with duct tape — just as it appears on the artwork — in an effort to realize a vision of herself “that was fully representative of how [her] gender felt in that moment,” she told the publication. “I felt like stopping taking my birth control, I had cut some sort of cord between myself and this regulated femininity,” she continued. Lorde would later tease “Man of the Year” through her 2025 Met Gala look, wearing a strapless, slate strip of fabric adhered to her chest that mirrored what the song's cover art would look like. The rollout cycle for Virgin — which will follow 2021's Solar Power — has marked the “Royals” singer's first time opening up about her broadening gender identity. “I had made my body very small, because I thought that that was what you did as a woman and a woman on display,” she recently told Document Journal. “It had the effect of making me [feel] totally ungrounded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During the May 14 episode of his “New Heights” podcast, Kelce slipped a telling detail that immediately sent the internet into overdrive. While Travis Kelce didn't outright say he and Taylor Swift live together, his choice of words during the “New Heights” podcast was enough. The comment follows a string of insider reports suggesting the couple has been living together on and off since late 2023. Since then, sources say the couple has split their time between Swift's homes and Kelce's during the pop star's “gap year” from touring. Reportedly, Swift starts her day with yogurt, eggs, and a latte—while Kelce, ever the supportive partner, gives her massages and is careful not to use “even half of his strength.” For a couple often under public scrutiny, they seem to be enjoying a very normal, domestic rhythm. Kelce also made headlines for a playful moment at teammate Patrick Mahomes' “15 and the Mahomies” charity gala in Las Vegas. Though Taylor Swift did not attend, she still contributed—donating a signed guitar for the event's auction. A fan-captured video shows Kelce standing by his table, paddle in hand, watching as bids climbed on Swift's autographed item. Whether he was referring to the actual guitar or another personalized Swift item remains unclear, but the room—including Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes—burst into laughter. Many fans speculated Kelce may have been trying to drive up the bidding before pulling back, adding yet another layer of charm to the viral moment. The clip quickly spread across social media, earning more than 10,000 likes on X (formerly Twitter). Do you think Travis Kelce was referring to Taylor Swift when he said, “we”?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift contributed “Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor's Version),” a re-recorded version of the hit single from her 2017 studio album, Reputation, to an episode of The Handmaid's Tale. Swift has not yet released the song online or on streaming services, nor has she announced the full album Reputation (Taylor's Version). “I've been wanting to use a Taylor song for many years on the show and we finally found the perfect spot for a track from her, and I'm so glad we waited because there could not be a more perfect song for a more perfect moment,” Elisabeth Moss, the lead star and executive producer of the series, told Billboard. As a Swiftie myself, and I think I can speak for [co-star] Yvonne [Strahovski] and our entire cast as well, who are all Swifties, it's such an honor to be able to use her music in the final episodes of our show.” Featuring her singles “Look What You Made Me Do” and “...Ready for It?,” Reputation was Swift's fifth No. It earned Swift just one Grammy nomination, for Best Pop Vocal Album, but she ultimately lost to Ariana Grande and Sweetener. Swift recorded one part of Reputation with producer Jack Antonoff, but she did the bulk of it with Max Martin and Shellback. She also enlisted Future and Ed Sheeran for “End Game.” So far, Swift has re-released four of her albums: Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version) arrived in 2021, while updates of Speak Now and 1989 were released in 2023. In a 2022 interview with NPR, Braun said that he had “regrets” over how the deal panned out. She recently wrapped up her record-breaking Eras Tour, which spanned the globe and lasted multiple years.
