                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.K. government said on Tuesday that it is suspending free trade talks with Israel and imposing sanctions on some settlements in the occupied West Bank over Israel's recent escalation in Gaza — an announcement being slammed by pro-Palestine advocates as “grotesquely inadequate.” In remarks to Parliament, Foreign Secretary David Lammy criticized Israel's recent escalation of its assault on Gaza and its lengthy total aid blockade on the region. He said that Israel's plan to forcibly displace all Palestinians from Gaza is “morally unjustifiable” and “wholly disproportionate.” “History will judge them,” Lammy said, ignoring the role of the U.K. and leaders of his own party in allowing Israel's genocide to reach this point. He said that the government is levying sanctions on three individuals and four entities involved in settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank. The announcement came after U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was “horrified by the escalation,” following a joint statement with the French and Canadian governments threatening “concrete action” against Israel and calling for a ceasefire on Monday. The U.K. has been in negotiations for a new free trade agreement with Israel since 2022, launched under conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson. However, data analyzed by pro-Palestine groups has shown that the U.K. has exported thousands of munitions to Israel since the suspension took effect — raising questions over whether the U.K. continued supposedly suspended shipments of F-35 jet parts. “Today could be a turning point, where the government begins to undo the depths of its complicity in Israel's genocide, by treating Israel not as an ally, but as a rogue state carrying out atrocities. Or, without further action, it will be recognised as just a last ditch attempt to salvage its reputation as a government that has enabled these crimes,” the group said. “Suspending the trade negotiations is a positive step forward but without bolder action this will have little impact. Without suspending parts for Israeli F-35 fighter jets, the UK Government remains complicit in the deaths of thousands of civilians across Gaza,” said Halima Begum, Oxfam GB's executive director, in a statement. “The Foreign Secretary should now suspend all arms exports to Israel and impose a full package of sanctions on political leaders and settlers in Israel who are seeking to erase Palestine from the map,” Begum went on. “I just asked the Foreign Secretary why arms sales to Israel under this Labour government now exceed those under the Tories. He dismissed it as ‘clickbait,'” said MP Zarah Sultana on social media. The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>George Simion claims presidential election rerun was subject to foreign interference, like last year's annulled ballot The winner of the annulled vote, far-right firebrand Călin Georgescu, was barred from standing again and is under formal investigation on counts including misreporting campaign spending, illegal use of digital technology and promoting fascist groups. “Just as Călin Georgescu was removed and the elections were annulled, we will challenge the election of Nicușor Dan for exactly the same reasons,” Simion, an EU-critical, Trump-admiring former soccer ultra, said in a statement to local media. Simion has repeatedly alleged electoral fraud without providing evidence. His belated decision to contest the election's outcome, while unlikely to succeed, will prolong the political uncertainty in Romania, which is under a caretaker government. The ultranationalist, whose supporters carried out a parallel count at some polling stations, said votes were “correctly counted” but “international observers” had seen “foreign interference” and “social media and algorithms have been manipulated”. He claimed there was “irrefutable evidence” of meddling by France, Moldova and others in “an orchestrated effort to manipulate institutions, direct media narratives and impose a result that does not reflect the sovereign will of the Romanian people”. Simion referenced a suggestion by the founder of the Telegram messaging app, Pavel Durov, that Paris had asked it to “silence conservative voices” in Romania. France has “categorically rejected” what it called “completely unfounded allegations”. Russian-born Durov, who also has French nationality, is being investigated by France in connection with alleged criminal activity on the app, including child abuse images and drug trafficking. Telegram has said it abides by EU law and denies the platform facilitates illegal activities. The far-right candidate said he had congratulated Dan on election night because “I love Romania, the Romanian people, and I never want to see bloodshed.” The count may have been correct, he said, “but before and during it, there was manipulation”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In his first news conference after winning the Canadian elections last month, Prime Minister Mark Carney laid out his incoming government's plans to tackle a “once-in-a-lifetime crisis” with the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump's steep tariffs on Canadian goods and repeated threats to annex Canada helped propel Carney's Liberal Party to victory in the April 28 vote. Now, Carney told reporters in Ottawa on May 2, the country would be embarking on “the biggest transformation” of its economy since World War II. “We will work with provinces, territories and Indigenous groups to identify projects that are in the national interest — projects that will connect Canada, deepen our ties with the world, and grow our economy for generations,” the prime minister said. “We'll make the Canadian government a catalyst for these projects, not an impediment.” Indeed, a central component of the Liberal Party's 2025 election platform was a promise to streamline — and speed up — the process of getting major energy projects built in Canada, including oil and gas pipelines. Amid a wave of anti-Trump Canadian nationalism, the plan has been widely welcomed. Many Canadians, including those who have historically been opposed to fossil fuel projects, also have expressed a new willingness to back pipelines. Under Canada's constitution, Indigenous communities must be consulted and accommodated on any project that could impact their lands, waters and way of life. Some have questioned how Carney's push to speed things up will affect Indigenous rights — or be squared with Canada's commitment to upholding the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). “This notion of the ‘energy superpower' kind of deeply unsettled me,” said Willo Prince, education coordinator at Indigenous Climate Action, an Indigenous-led group working to combat the climate crisis. Indigenous rights are inherent, but they were made constitutional in Canada through the Constitution Act of 1982. Since then, Canadian courts have laid out what this means in practice. Notably, they have upheld that the Crown — the government — has what's called a “duty to consult [and] accommodate” Indigenous people when considering an action that may negatively affect their rights. “The duty to consult exists on what the courts have said is a spectrum,” explained Bruce McIvor, a partner at First Peoples Law, a law firm in the province of British Columbia specializing in Indigenous rights. “Where the Crown is expected to decide it falls on that spectrum is a combination of how strong of a claim does the First Nation have, and how serious is the potential effect,” McIvor told Truthout in an interview. But despite these commitments, for decades, Indigenous leaders have said Canada's approach to consultation has been flawed and failed to meet its obligations. Many have accused governments at the federal and provincial levels of conducting a box-checking exercise — rather than meaningful consultation — and ultimately moving forward with projects despite community opposition. In some cases, Indigenous leaders have also accused project proponents of seeking to divide and conquer their communities. In one recent case involving a pipeline set to cut through traditional Wet'suwet'en territory in northern British Columbia, the company and government said they had the support of First Nations band councils along the proposed route. Band councils are elected bodies that were created by the Canadian government to govern and oversee issues on First Nation reserves. According to Prince at Indigenous Climate Action, Canada most often treats Indigenous consultation as “just a footnote” in its push to build. It's a consideration that comes after the conversation is done,” Prince said. At the same time, Indigenous communities in Canada are disproportionately affected by resource development projects, Prince noted. “What we need to be focusing on is community well-being [and] place-based initiatives that respect Indigenous sovereignty,” said Prince, who is Carrier Dakelh from Nak'azdli Whut'en, a First Nation in British Columbia. The party did not say how the term “national interest” would be defined exactly, nor did it lay out which projects might fall under that umbrella. But Carney said during the election campaign that he is open to “getting pipelines built across this country so that we can displace imports of foreign oil.” Similar initiatives have been seen at the provincial level in British Columbia and Ontario — Canada's most populous province — in response to frayed Canada-U.S. relations. The British Columbian government has proposed legislation that would allow it to fast-track infrastructure projects while Ontario Premier Doug Ford is pushing a bill that would create “special economic zones” where major projects can be approved quickly and without having to meet regulations. Both proposals have been met with pushback from Indigenous communities who say they will trample over their rights. “This will enable businesses to navigate regulations more quickly and with fewer redundancies. “You automatically undermine, I think, the spirit of the duty to consult if you're starting point is, ‘How do we get to yes? Levac said Canadians should be asking, “What is at stake when we speed things up?” “The reason these projects take a long time — although it tends to be wrapped in a blanket argument of red tape and bureaucratic barriers — actually also has to do with some fairly substantive commitments,” she told Truthout in an interview. McIvor said reviews can take a long time for a variety of reasons, including unrealistic timelines set by governments or project proponents; governmental delays; or a lack of funding and other barriers that prevent meaningful Indigenous consultation from taking place.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The controversial vote, suspended last year by the country's constitutional court, saw the pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, Nicusor Dan, defeat his Euroskeptic rival, George Simion, with 54% of second round votes. On TikTok and other platforms, Romanians living abroad began sharing clips in which they can be seen destroying their passports. We will never return,” one woman said in a widely viewed video. “Romania is dead,” proclaimed another netizen in a separate clip. The passport-cutting campaign comes amid claims from Simion and his supporters that the election had been manipulated by Romanian authorities, who allegedly coordinated with foreign powers to sway the vote. Simion claims that the electoral rolls contained some 1.7 million fictitious names and accused the government of busing in voters from neighboring Moldova. Simion's Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) has also claimed that Moldova's pro-EU ruling Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) had directed its million-strong diaspora in Romania to support Dan. Around 30% of Moldova's population are dual Moldovan-Romanian citizens. Simion had been a supporter of the independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu, a NATO and EU critic, who won the first round of elections in November 2024, but which were later annulled by Romania's Constitutional Court, which alleged foreign interference. Telegram founder Pavel Durov has claimed that French intelligence attempted to pressure him into censoring conservative Romanian channels ahead of the vote. Paris has denied the claim while Romanian officials have in turn accused Russia of interference, but have not presented any evidence to support their claim. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has also denied Bucharest's accusations of election interference and dismissed Romania's latest vote as illegitimate. Officials should clean up their own “electoral mess” instead of blaming others, she said. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LaMonica McIver denounces charge as ‘purely political' and says prosecutors are distorting her actions to deter legislative oversight The justice department has accused LaMonica McIver of assaulting, impeding or interfering with law enforcement following a demonstration outside the facility in Newark, New Jersey. Ms McIver and two other Democratic lawmakers were protesting outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Delaney Hall centre on May 9 when a confrontation broke out as a member of the group was asked to leave. Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, was arrested and later released after spending several hours in custody, while Ms McIver, a representative for New Jersey's 10th congressional district, became embroiled in a heated discussion with uniformed officials. “I have persistently made efforts to address these issues without bringing criminal charges and have given Representative McIver every opportunity to come to a resolution, but she has unfortunately declined,” US attorney Alina Habba wrote in a letter, posted on X. Ms McIver has denied any wrongdoing and accused federal agents of escalating the situation by arresting Mr Baraka. She also denounced the charge as “purely political” and said prosecutors are distorting her actions in an effort to deter legislative oversight. “This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right,” she said in a statement. At one point, her elbows push into an officer wearing a dark face covering, but it is not clear if the contact was accidental or intentional. Asked about the charges on Tuesday, Donald Trump said Ms McIver was “totally out of control” and that “the days of woke are over”. Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, wrote on X that Ms McIver had been charged following a “thorough review of the video footage”. “This administration will always protect those who work tirelessly to keep America safe.” “Rather than facilitating that inspection, ICE agents chose to escalate what should have been a peaceful situation into chaos,” Paul Fishman, the former US attorney for New Jersey, said in a statement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The unpredictability of US trade policy has also dented exporters' confidence. The survey found 42% of exporting companies now anticipate turnover to decline between -2% and -10% over the next 12 months, compared to fewer than 5% before 2 April “liberation day” – when Trump unveiled his tariff policy. Trump has insisted that tariffs will make America “very wealthy again”, though it appears that American companies and consumers are simply expecting to pay higher prices as the tariffs settle into place. Instead of immediately raising prices, which could deter customers, many companies have spent months trying to get ahead of Trump's tariffs by stockpiling goods to temporarily circumvent them. Nearly eight out of 10 American companies said that they frontloaded shipments to China before Trump announced his tariffs, with 25% saying they had started to front-load before the November 2024 election. Inflation data from April showed that US price increases remained roughly level for the month. Economists say that it will take a while for tariff-related price increases to show up in data and companies have started to say they will pass some of the cost of tariffs onto consumers. Toymaker Mattel also said that it would have to raise prices and that it would continue to manufacture its products outside of the US, “where [it] can be more efficient and more productive”, the company's CEO, Ynon Kreiz, told CNBC earlier this month. While many companies are holding out on price increases, relying on stockpiled inventory and hoping trade deals will be reached soon, companies will have to raise prices in the summer if a trade war continues. “Monthly business surveys … do indicate that companies will eventually pass on most of the tariff increases by the summer,” said Maxine Darmet, senior economist at Allianz Trade.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Director Julia Ducournau, second from left, and cast members Tahar Rahim, Golshifteh Farahani and Finnegan Oldfield at the screening of the film Alpha in Cannes.Sarah Meyssonnier/Reuters These are the indelible elements that make up French filmmaker Julia Ducournau's new horror-drama Alpha, which made an explosive landing at the Cannes Film Festival on Monday night, blowing all previous competitors out of the French Riviera water. So much so that an audience member in the balcony had to be tended to in the midst of the screening due to a medical emergency, echoing the moment when, in 2016, several moviegoers passed out during a Toronto International Film Festival screening of Ducournau's debut feature, Raw. At once a metaphor for the AIDS crisis and a meditation on the million little traumas that are inherited across families for generations, Alpha follows three characters in various states of distress: heroin addict Amin (Tahar Rahim), his physician sister (Golshifteh Farahani) and her troubled 13-year-old daughter Alpha (Melissa Boros), who one day comes home from a disreputable house party with a tattoo whose imprint sets off a chain of cataclysmic events. There is, to put it lightly, a lot going on inside of Alpha‘s apocalyptic world, not nearly all of which is digestible upon first viewing – especially one that didn't get started until close to 11 p.m. But as the crowd rose to its feet to award an emotional Ducournau a rousing standing ovation – no one needs to time these things to the minute, but it lasted far longer than any other reception at Cannes so far – it was clear that Alpha had hit a nerve. Which, by this deep into the festival, needed to happen one way or another. Wes Anderson's The Phoenician Scheme, which screened Sunday night, is an emotionally empty exercise in fussiness, a steep drop-off from Asteroid City. And Egyptian director Tarik Saleh's political satire Eagles of the Republic, which screened Monday afternoon, failed to deliver on its incendiary promise of roasting Cairo's corrupt class. In the sidebar Directors' Fortnight program, Canadian director Lloyd Lee Choi delivered a knockout with his drama Lucky Lu. In his feature-length debut, the director, who was recently named the winner of this year's TIFF-CBC Films Screenwriter Award, traces a disastrous 48-hour period for a New York delivery driver (Chang Chen) as he anticipates the arrival of his wife and young daughter from overseas. A potent mix of Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves and the Safdie brothers' Uncut Gems, Choi's film (not technically a Canadian title given it was produced in the U.S.) is excellent high-anxiety cinema. Also causing heart palpitations, in a good way, was Spike Lee's out-of-competition thriller Highest 2 Lowest. An extremely loose remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1958 drama High and Low, the Denzel Washington-starring film premiered Monday just a few hours before Alpha, a nice bit of festival symmetry given that Lee's jury awarded Ducournau her Palme d'Or in 2021. Once Lee pushed his new film's unbearably melodramatic score to the background and let Washington do what he does best – devour the screen with an unmatched ferocity – the film offered a sometimes silly but ultimately electric ride. Especially once Washington was able to pair off against hip-hop star A$AP Rocky, who plays an aspiring rapper to Washington's record-biz mogul.

MOSCOW, May 20. /TASS/. Ukrainian prison officials have proposed that civilians accused of political crimes be included in the country's list of 1,000 prisoners to be exchanged with Russia as part of the deal made at the Istanbul talks, the Strana news outlet reported, citing sources among lawyers.

According to the outlet, this would involve people accused of aiding Russia in some way and high treason. These include Ukrainians arrested for photographing military facilities and setting cars on fire, as well as entrepreneurs accused of financial crimes. Strana pointed out that Kiev's desire to expand the swap list may be due to the fact that, if the agreed "1,000 for 1,000" swap goes ahead, Ukraine could be left with few Russian prisoners in custody.

Russia and Ukraine held talks in Istanbul on May 16. Following the meeting, Moscow and Kiev agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, present their vision of a potential ceasefire, outlining all its conditions, as well as continue the negotiating process.

Kherson Region Governor Vladimir Saldo earlier supported the idea that Kiev swap civilians held for supporting Russia along with Russian prisoners of war.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Belgium is ready to deploy troops to Ukraine as soon as there is a ceasefire with Russia and annually provide the country with weapons worth one billion euros, Defense Minister Theo Francken told reporters. They are developing a plan and working very closely together. The moment there is a ceasefire, we can immediately operate with the coalition of the willing on Ukrainian soil," Francken said upon his arrival at the EU foreign and defense ministers' meeting in Brussels. The top defense official emphasized that Russian forces must withdraw from Ukrainian territory immediately following a ceasefire. "We will keep on supporting Ukraine. We just approved a one-billion-euro package, and we will keep on supporting Ukraine for next years, [allocating] one billion euros in military aid each year," he noted, adding that Belgium uses this money to order weapons for Kiev from its own defense enterprises. It's important that a significant part of this money comes back to Belgium and creates jobs in our defense industries. We have an excellent defense industry, which is why we will support it, even if it requires significant funding. That is why this billion is guaranteed; we will continue providing this level of support," Francken emphasized. Belgium only has about 40 F-16s, commissioned in the 1970s, and it promises to transfer them to Kiev as soon as it receives the new jets. It is unclear how many of the F-16s Belgium currently has are operational.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. The EU has formally approved its 17th package of sanctions imposed on Russia over aggression in Ukraine, including measures against almost 200 shadow fleet vessels, top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas announced on May 20. "New measures also address hybrid threats and human rights. The 17th package was supported by EU ambassadors last week, but has since then been criticized as weak and watered down. The package also targets components vital to Russia's defense industry, namely chemicals, materials, and dual-use goods. The EU has threatened Russia with additional sanctions unless President Vladimir Putin commits to a ceasefire and agrees to seriously engage in peace efforts. President Volodymyr Zelensky also announced that a new "strong EU sanctions package" is underway. While European leaders have proclaimed that additional sanctions are coordinated with Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump, who held a phone call with Putin on May 19, said he does not intend to impose new measures on Moscow to avoid disrupting peace efforts. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. Our goal: reach 20,000 members to prove independent journalism can survive without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr Kevin O'Connor has had a close relationship with the former president's family since 2009 Signing off on the final routine medical examination of Joe Biden's presidency, physician Kevin O'Connor declared the former US president to be a “healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male”. But the diagnosis of an aggressive form of prostate cancer, said only to have been discovered last week, has raised questions over the transparency of White House physicians and their personal loyalty to the presidents they serve. It is unclear whether the former president was screened for prostate cancer during his presidency and health bodies have warned that PSA testing is often unreliable. They run a military-like operation providing round-the-clock medical care to the president, often accompanying them on Air Force One during domestic and international trips. Among their biggest jobs is to perform an annual physical exam performed at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre to determine if the president is fit for office. But administrations have great discretion over what to include in the releases, given that there is no federal law requiring US presidents to release their health records. In turn, some reports have faced questions over their accuracy. At the centre of Mr Biden's medical care is Dr O'Connor, who has had a close relationship with the Biden family that dates back to 2009. Years later, he is said to have consulted with Mr Biden's niece about an eye problem. His relationship with Mr Biden grew as he shadowed the medical team involved in the treatment of his son Beau's brain cancer. He would go on to become a voice of reason for the former president. I can't make you not look like s---,” Mr Biden recounted. He was initially contracted to be Mr Biden's physician for just six months when the Obama administration began in 2009. “That didn't work out and, so, I ended up doing the whole eight years with him,” Dr O'Connor joked in an interview last year with the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine about his role as the president's chief physician. Mr Biden brought Dr O'Connor back to the White House when he became president in 2021. “I retired and had a plan, and here I am again,” Dr O'Connor, who grew up in New Jersey, said at the time. Outside of the White House, Dr O'Connor is said to have worked closely with James Biden, the president's brother, at a company that operated rural hospitals. The stocky former army surgeon was always close to his number one patient, ready to provide care as needed though few outside the building would know who he is. But Mr Biden's politically crippling debate performance changed all that. It was he, just four months before the disastrous debate that unfolded in front of that world, who had overseen Mr Biden's most recent physical exam in 2024 insisting the president at the time “continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations”. Donald Trump questioned the medical assessments carried out by Dr O'Connor during a press conference in the Oval Office on Monday evening. And I think the doctor said ‘he's just fine', and it's turned out that's not so, it's very dangerous,” he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Until last week, a secretive fleet of ships ferrying Russian oil around the world showed no clear links to the Kremlin. That changed when, in a dramatic escalation, Russia used a fighter jet in an apparent effort to protect one of the tankers thought to be in the fleet. “This is something very new,” Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told reporters Thursday at a NATO meeting in Turkey. Russia has now “officially tied and connected itself” to the so-called shadow fleet, he added. Related article Europe's undersea infrastructure keeps getting damaged. Estimated to be hundreds of vessels strong, with no official ties to Russia, the “shadow fleet” includes many old, poorly maintained ships, which have in some instances wreaked environmental havoc and, according to some, have been implicated in damage to vital undersea cables off the Baltic coast. Russia has denied any role in the damage. The tankers, many with opaque ownership structures, transport Russian oil for export to avoid Western sanctions. As such, they have themselves become a focus of further sanctions on Moscow. CNN has corroborated details of the footage, which was shared online by Margarita Simonyan, editor in chief of Russian state media outlet RT. In response, Portuguese F-16 jets on a NATO mission in Estonia were rushed to the area to monitor the Russian aircraft, NATO said. The jets are part of a strengthened NATO presence in northern Europe since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. “Probably what the Kremlin is trying to do is push back on that, so in the hope that NATO nations get spooked by what happened (last Tuesday),” said Arnold at RUSI. “There will be those within NATO who are a bit worried about this and say, ‘Well, hang on, do we really want to risk starting a wider confrontation with Russia over one ship? For the Estonians, the Russian jet's intrusion into Estonian air space is proof that Western sanctions are biting. The incident “demonstrates that monitoring and sanctioning the shadow fleet is effective and that such efforts must be further intensified,” the Estonian Defense Forces said in a statement. Related article Ships, sea drones and AI: How NATO is hardening its defense of critical Baltic undersea cables “We see the (Tuesday) incident as a reaction to Baltic Sentry,” Col. Martin O'Donnell, a NATO spokesman, told CNN. “Russia's destabilizing actions will not deter us from acting within international law to maintain maritime security, safety and freedom of navigation.” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday that a new sanctions package could be adopted as early as Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to join Russia's talks with Ukraine in Turkey last week. Merz had said earlier that Russia's “shadow fleet” – “permanently operating in the Baltic Sea with up to 300 ships” – would be specifically targeted in this package. In a possible tit-for-tat move, a Greek-owned oil tanker, Green Admire, was detained Sunday by Russia as it transited Russian waters on a route agreed by Estonia, Finland and Russia, Estonia's foreign minister posted on X. Estonian authorities have conducted more than 450 checks on vessels in Tallinn-controlled waters in the Baltic Sea since last June, according to the country's transport ministry.</p>

LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) has been charged by the Department of Justice (DOJ) with assaulting law enforcement during a scuffle that occurred outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in New Jersey, U.S. Attorney Alina Habba said on May 19. Habba said that McIver's conduct “cannot be overlooked” by the chief federal law enforcement authority in New Jersey, adding that the charges were filed after efforts to address the matter were unsuccessful. “I have persistently made efforts to address these issues without bringing criminal charges and have given Representative McIver every opportunity to come to a resolution, but she has unfortunately declined,” the U.S. attorney stated. McIver alleged that it was ICE agents who created “an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation” during the arrest of the mayor. “This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right.” The Trump administration opened Delaney Hall as a detention facility for illegal immigrants on May 1 as part of its broader crackdown on illegal immigration nationwide. The move has triggered protests by illegal immigrant advocates and some Democratic politicians in recent weeks, including Baraka, a gubernatorial candidate. Delaney Hall is a 1,000-bed facility along an industrial stretch of Newark Bay, according to the private prison company that operates the center. Baraka has said that the facility lacks the proper city permits in order to open, including a certificate of occupancy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. There have been plenty of other attempts in that interval. But most have been stymied by the principle of territorial integrity, which prioritizes fixed borders even in cases of state failure and makes the path to legal independence long and uncertain. But in the last few years, this norm has grown weaker. Just how serious he is remains to be seen. For some secessionist groups, this is certainly good news. Independence movements no longer must prove that their cause is just or essential. Instead, they may simply need to align with powerful countries, especially in strategically important areas. Trump's preference for personal diplomacy could also help separatists, provided that they have charismatic leaders who can sidestep cumbersome institutional diplomacy and court the American president himself. Yet Trump's rejection of international norms is a double-edged sword. They also give secessionists a way to make their claims. Independence movements typically justify their existence using the language of human rights and self-determination, which Trump disregards. Rather, this U.S. president favors strong, brutal rulers over fledgling upstarts. But for those that Trump sees as strategically useless, he will either change nothing or make life more difficult. More breakaway regions may receive some form of recognition, but it would be weak and partial—contingent on whether their leaders can keep aiding more powerful states. And the world as a whole will experience more bloodshed, as both governments and separatists, unencumbered by global sanctions or normative restrictions, become more assertive. Trump is hardly the first modern American president to ignore norms governing territorial integrity when they become inconvenient. He has repeatedly called the U.S.-Canadian border an “artificially drawn line.” These remarks are bad news for the people of Ukraine and Canada, who have made it clear that they do not want to join Russia or the United States, respectively. But if Trump's realpolitik approach takes hold, secessionist entities might find it easier to gain legitimacy by aligning with the United States or other great powers. Movements in valuable locations, such as Kurdish separatists in oil-rich Iraq or the leadership of Somaliland (which is already functionally independent, and located in the geographically important Horn of Africa), might secure U.S. recognition and support if they advance Washington's aims. Separatists in Greenland who seek independence from Denmark, or in New Caledonia who seek independence from France, could garner support from the United States or another great power if they can promise trade routes, military bases, or access to their resources. In Trump's world, secessionists may also be able to succeed—or at least gain traction—through diplomacy. Typically, separatists are disadvantaged in talks because they are cut off from the kinds of formal institutional channels through which diplomacy normally flows. Instead, he prefers personal diplomacy, such as his 2018 discussions with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump's world, however, will hardly guarantee more success for secessionists. The president has loosened constraints on independence movements, but his preference for strongmen and centralized control creates new obstacles. Trump tends to favor aggressive national leaders who project power, not upstart rebels or subnational challengers. During Trump's first term, for example, Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Biafra separatist movement in Nigeria, issued a personal plea to the U.S. president, citing Trump's support for Brexit as proof of his belief in self-determination. Yet there is no evidence that Trump responded, either publicly or privately, to Kanu's appeals. The U.S. government treated Biafra, which is of little strategic value to the United States, as an internal Nigerian matter, as it had for decades. In October 2019, Trump even ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria, effectively abandoning the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and allowing Turkey to launch a military operation against them. The move drew bipartisan criticism as a destabilizing betrayal of a reliable partner, and Trump ultimately agreed to keep U.S. troops in Syria (where they remain). But it still showed Trump's willingness to prioritize regional power politics over friendly secessionists. More generally, Trump's geopolitical vision favors stable spheres of influence, where great powers set the rules. Trump, in other words, may tolerate secession if it serves a purpose. But he is unlikely to encourage it as a principle. Instead, it will reconfigure the terrain on which they operate. But now separatist success will largely depend on whether the movement serves the interests of a dominant power, not on its legitimacy or efficacy. Secessionism, in turn, could cease to function as a tool of imperial resistance and instead become a tool of empire itself—a means for great powers to project influence or engage in proxy conflict (as Russia has already done by propping up breakaway regions in Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine). Recognition will remain rare, both because great-power interests often conflict and because home states—less constrained by norms or economic restrictions—will be empowered to crush separatist uprisings before they gain ground. Instead of new full-blown states, partial recognition cases, such as Kosovo, Northern Cyprus, Palestine, and Western Sahara, might become more common. For places that are already functionally independent, a transactional global order might open new diplomatic venues or economic channels that bring them closer to official recognition—provided, of course, that they can offer strategic value such as basing rights or resource access. For regions that lack de facto independence, success will now hinge even less on legal or moral claims. In this newly contingent and chaotic world, separatist-related violence will also become more frequent. In part, that will simply be the product of renewed separatist attempts. But breakaway regions could also launch more violent attacks, encouraged by their newfound patrons and the diminished consequences of breaking international law. The global institutions that traditionally restrain both secessionist overreach and heavy-handed repression are losing their power to constrain either. The EU once played a central role in restraining violence between Serbia and Kosovo, for example, using accession talks as leverage to encourage cooperation. The UN helped limit violence in East Timor and South Sudan by providing peacekeeping forces. But ultimately, these institutions derive their power from the support of member countries, which is weakening. For independence movements, the new rules of secession mean a more volatile and uncertain future. If success depends on timing, charisma, and strategic utility, some breakaway regions may have a shortcut to recognition. All of them, however, will have to navigate a landscape where sovereignty is not earned but cynically auctioned off.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. U.S. strategy broadly revolves around deterring China from attacking Taiwan, and for the past three presidential administrations, it has consisted of three central components: increasing the ability of the United States and Taiwan to defend the island militarily; using diplomacy to signal U.S. resolve to protect Taiwan while also reassuring China that Washington does not support Taiwanese independence; and using economic pressure to slow China's military modernization efforts. But there is little consensus on the right balance among these three components—and that balance determines to some degree how deterrence looks in practice. Some contend that diplomatic pressure—along with military restraint, to avoid antagonizing China—will keep Beijing at bay. Others warn that unless Washington significantly strengthens its military posture in Asia, deterrence will collapse. And a third approach, outlined recently in Foreign Affairs by Jennifer Kavanagh and Stephen Wertheim, emphasizes that bolstering Taiwan's self-defense and enabling offshore U.S. support is the best route to sustaining deterrence while also mitigating the risk of escalation.These prescriptions have merit but fall short of grappling with the paradox at the heart of U.S. strategy: deterrence can fail in two ways. Do too little, and Beijing may gamble it can seize Taiwan before Washington is able to respond. Do too much, and Chinese leaders may conclude that force is the only remaining path to unification. Navigating this dilemma requires more than a stronger military or bolder diplomacy. Combined properly, forward-deployed capabilities, diplomatic restraint, and selective economic interdependence can reinforce one another to maintain credible deterrence while avoiding provocation. So far, however, the Trump administration's approach to Taiwan has veered between harsh transactionalism, such as the imposition of a 32 percent tariff on most Taiwanese goods last month, and quiet reaffirmations of support for Taipei through bipartisan visits and a pause on the highest tariffs. Several, such as those in Cagayan and Isabela Provinces, are just a few hundred miles from Taiwan. Washington and Tokyo agreed in 2023 to restructure the U.S. Marine Corps presence in Okinawa from the artillery-focused 12th Marine Regiment, part of a force of roughly 18,000 marines stationed in Japan, into a 2,000-strong Marine Littoral Regiment, a quick-reaction force designed to operate along the so-called first island chain encompassing Indonesia, Japan, portions of the Philippines, and Taiwan. To complement this effort, the U.S. military has increased joint military exercises and expanded integrated air and missile defense systems across allied territories. But U.S. military capabilities in the Pacific need more than just quantitative upgrades; they require qualitative shifts to be able to block China from forcibly unifying with Taiwan. The United States needs a greater forward presence in the region, as well as specific capabilities that would prevent an invading force from making its way across the Taiwan Strait, such as strategic bombers, submarines, and antiship missiles. Once those were deployed, they would also require significant operational flexibility. So far, the U.S. military has stopped short of seeking such changes because they are politically sensitive both at home and abroad: host countries worry they might become greater targets of Chinese aggression, and some U.S. policymakers worry that such moves could cross a redline for Beijing. But if Washington follows a few principles, such improvements will not necessarily provoke Chinese aggression. As U.S. forces increase their activities around and in Taiwan, be they joint exercises, freedom of navigation exercises, or training, U.S. officials should refrain from making statements to which China might feel forced to respond. Military upgrades should be concealed or downplayed until they are fielded to minimize the likelihood that China will effectively launch a coercive campaign against their deployment. Bolstering Taiwan's independent military capabilities—a long-standing U.S. policy—presents an arguably even bigger risk of provocation. In recent years, Taiwan has acquired defense capabilities with the aim of deterring potential Chinese aggression. It has bought asymmetric warfare systems, such as coastal defense cruise missiles and HIMARS rocket systems, moving away from traditional high-cost platforms such as submarines. It has also pledged that its defense budget will exceed three percent of GDP in 2025 and that it will prioritize precision-guided munitions, air defense upgrades, command-and-control systems, equipment for reserve forces, and anti-drone technologies. These are sensible steps, but they also pose a risk: the less Taiwan depends on U.S. assistance, the more China's leaders worry that Taiwan's president, Lai Ching-te, could be emboldened to declare independence unilaterally—further incentivizing Beijing to invade sooner rather than later. To prevent deterrence from morphing into provocation, the United States should provide Taiwan mainly with capabilities that rely on continued U.S. support. In 2024, for example, the Biden administration approved the sale of three National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems to Taiwan in a deal that was brokered to increase U.S.-Taiwanese interoperability. But during both the Trump and the Biden administrations, the United States has relaxed its longstanding policy of “strategic ambiguity,” wherein U.S. policy has avoided defining whether and under what circumstances Washington would intervene to defend Taiwan. Instead, the United States has been signaling to China its determination to defend Taiwan—especially by making incremental moves toward establishing formal diplomatic relations with the island, such as direct interactions between American and Taiwanese officials. Joe Biden was the first U.S. president to invite Taiwan's diplomatic representatives to attend his inauguration, for example, and he repeatedly referred to a U.S. “commitment” to Taiwan's defense, even saying once that U.S. forces would defend the island in the event of an “unprecedented attack.” (White House officials stated at the time that there was no change to the official policy of “strategic ambiguity.”) Officials in the second Trump administration, including Mike Waltz before he was ousted as national security adviser, have advocated ending strategic ambiguity and moving toward “strategic clarity.” And in February, the State Department removed a statement about not supporting Taiwan's independence from its website—a deletion that China interpreted as provocative. Although they may seem merely symbolic, such diplomatic slights have real consequences, making it harder for Beijing to maintain a veneer of progress toward unification of the mainland with Taiwan. Chinese leaders see any drift toward Taiwanese independence as a threat to their legitimacy. Reassurance that Washington does not support Taiwanese independence should include public criticism when Taiwan's leaders make statements or take actions that suggest otherwise. For example, in December 2003, President George W. Bush publicly rebuked Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian during a joint press conference with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, stating that the United States opposed any “unilateral decision by either China or Taiwan to change the status quo,” noting that Chen's “comments and actions” had indicated “that he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally to change” it. In 2006, after Chen angered Beijing by scrapping a government council that had been established to guide unification with China, the Bush administration once again signaled its disapproval, denying the Taiwanese leader's request for a high-profile U.S. stopover during a presidential trip to Latin America. For instance, joint statements issued at the G-7 summit last month and at the Munich Security Conference in February reaffirmed cross-strait stability and expressed opposition to any unilateral actions that threaten peace in the Taiwan Strait, including through force or coercion. Washington should pair these diplomatic signals with a clear reaffirmation that its “one China” policy remains in place, that any resolution must be nonviolent, and that the United States is not against peaceful unification with Taiwan's assent. These changes to military capabilities and to U.S. diplomacy are easy compared with what is required in the third area of U.S. deterrence strategy: economic pressure. The Biden administration not only kept these tariffs in place but also added export controls on strategically important technologies, such as semiconductors and telecommunications. The United States also pressured American companies to shift their supply chains and manufacturing operations away from China. Nonetheless, these policies portend lasting damage to the Chinese economy, especially in view of China's looming demographic and environmental challenges. For Washington, the hope remains that Beijing may be unable to keep pace militarily as its relative growth rate slows. This economic pressure not only risks hardening China's resolve but also enables Beijing to recast itself as a defender of global trade norms and to shift blame for any global economic slowdown to the United States. This U.S. strategy will also have limited effects on China's long-term military prowess. China has pursued military modernization at historically low costs, avoiding the classic “guns or butter” dilemma. In this way, China has sustained both economic development and military modernization, but avoided a Cold War­–style arms race. China will therefore be able to continue its military modernization program even with a stagnant economy, especially if it increases its military spending as a share of GDP. Currently Chinese leaders would consider an invasion of Taiwan only in a specific, narrow scenario: if China could take the island before U.S. forces could intervene. For Beijing, a larger-scale, protracted war would be too costly. This would make them more willing to risk war over Taiwan. Concrete economic and diplomatic concessions that increase China's benefits from maintaining the status quo and credibly convey benign U.S. intent would be effective reassurances. This would not only quell Beijing's perception that the United States seeks to weaken and “split” China but also allay any brewing domestic instability that could threaten the CCP's legitimacy and encourage Chinese leaders to forcibly take Taiwan to boost nationalist legitimacy. Unilateral U.S. sanctions could set the Chinese economy on a path of permanent decline. Pausing or circumscribing an economic decoupling would give U.S. sanctions maximum bite and bolster deterrence. Of course, bolstering economic interdependence also requires limiting U.S. reliance on key Chinese imports, such as rare-earth minerals, transformers for the electric grid, scarce medicines, high-tech electronics, and other industrial, infrastructural, and military inputs. But Washington does not need to immediately reduce imports of Chinese consumer goods, even though substitutes can be found relatively easily. Finally, to maximize its deterrent leverage against China, Washington should coordinate a sanctions coalition with allies, which may require offering them subsidies or other concessions. For many in Washington, deterrence has come to mean projecting an uncompromising and even hostile posture toward China. The dilemma of deterrence—the fact that it can so easily slide into provocation or procrastination—necessitates such a tightrope approach. And if there's one place where striking the right balance could pay enormous dividends, it's Taiwan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In what could be a game changer for the Trump administration's deportation efforts, the U.S. Attorney's Office for California's Central District and federal partners launched a program to “neutralize California's sanctuary state policy.” Essayli stated in the press release that “the worst criminal aliens in state custody are frequently released into the community” because California's sanctuary state policies block cooperation with federal law enforcement. “These laws effectively render federal immigration detainers meaningless. The days of giving criminal illegal aliens a free pass are over,” he stated. “While California may be presently disregarding detainers, it cannot ignore federal arrest warrants.” The California federal district is home to the counties of Riverside, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles County. An estimated 1.5 million illegal immigrants reside in the district, including gang members, the press release said, adding that California's protection of criminal illegal aliens makes residents less safe. The release noted that in February 2025, José Cristian Saravia-Sánchez, 30, of Mexico, shot and killed an Inglewood man who tried to stop him from stealing a catalytic converter, which garnered national attention. He was an illegal immigrant who had been convicted of vehicle theft, removed from the United States in 2013, and arrested 11 times between June 2022 and August 2024, according to the release. Gavin Newsom did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Epoch Times by publication time.</p>
