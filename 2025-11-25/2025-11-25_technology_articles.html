                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Startup Fleet Space announced yesterday that it used its satellite-powered AI system to expand the scope of an already massive lithium deposit in Quebec. Fleet Space says its approach can help target drilling operations, reducing decision time from weeks to days. The startup currently has a small constellation of satellites in orbit that use a range of sensors, including electromagnetic and gravity-sensing, to map the subsurface. The Cisco project is currently estimating that it could produce up to 329 million metric tons of lithium oxide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speechify has largely been a tool that helps you listen to articles, PDFs, and documents. Just like other dictation tools, Speechify's voice typing corrects errors and removes filler words. In my short test of just more than a day, I felt there was a lot of room for improvement in Speechify's tool. For instance, the tools work fine with Gmail and Google Docs, but on sites like WordPress, I have had difficulty in triggering the voice dictation and having it work well. The company said that it is adding optimization for popular sites gradually. In terms of accuracy, the word error rate was higher than some other tools like Wispr Flow, Willow, and Monologue. Speechify noted that its model learns faster as you use it more, and the error rate will gradually decrease. We know from several years of building Speechify that there's a large portion of the market, which includes our users, who want voice as the primary, default setting every time they open an app and talk to AI,” Rohan Pavuluri, the company's chief business officer, told TechCrunch over email. Speechify said that it plans to include both voice typing and a voice assistant in all its apps across desktop and mobile gradually. The startup also wants to develop agents that complete tasks on your behalf. The startup didn't reveal its full roadmap, but gave one example: making calls for you to make an appointment or wait on hold with customer support of a company. Other companies like Truecaller and Cloacked have been chasing similar targets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're building an early-stage startup and trying to raise venture capital dollars to fuel your big ideas — focus on solving a specific problem, make sure you have strong conviction, and think hard about distribution in the age of AI. Those were some tips shared during a recent Seattle AI Week panel discussion I moderated with Kellan Carter, founding general partner at Bellevue, Wash.-based firm Fuse, and Rohan D'Souza, CEO and co-founder at Seattle-based healthcare benefits startup Avante. Fuse led Avante's $10 million seed round in late 2023, before the company was generating meaningful revenue. “There's so much trust that had been built,” Carter said, reflecting the importance of relationship-building between founders and VCs. The median Series A round in Q1 of this year was $7.9 million, according to Carta. But there were also nine companies that raised more than $200 million for their Series A rounds in Q3, according to CB Insights. “The variance for Series A is wider than ever,” Carter said. For those companies raising massive Series A rounds, Carter said it's about “unfair insight” that creates conviction and opens doors to capital. “The insight is so clear it's getting investors excited to cut that big of a check — because the prize is so big right now,” Carter said. Venture funding has increased to a 3-year high, largely thanks to AI, which accounted for 51% of all funding and 22% of deals in Q3, CB Insights reported. Carter joked that AI is “always in the pitch now — even if it's not AI.” For Fuse, assessing a pitch is about determining the best way to solve a customer's problem — with or without AI. Carter said investors lean toward founders who have domain knowledge and understand a first- or second-priority customer problem better than anyone else. “They have insight that's going to give them credibility in a customer conversation,” he said. He said customers may have “FOMO” when it comes to AI — fear of missing out — but they probably actually have “FOMU”: fear of messing up. Avante officially launched earlier this year as it scales its software product that aims to help companies decrease HR administration workload and reduce overall benefits program costs. As he thinks about raising a Series A round of funding, D'Souza said one advantage of bringing in fresh cash is that it acts as a signal to enterprise buyers — some who may be wary of an early stage, 20-person startup tucked away in the Pacific Northwest. “So as a founder, I'm like, OK, should we really aggressively start to pursue more money on the balance sheet? And how do you get there much faster?” he said. D'Souza, a former product chief at healthcare automation company Olive AI, stressed the importance of transparency with investors. D'Souza said Avante deliberately planned no recurring revenue for 2024, ran an early adopter program that wasn't free, then came out of stealth in April 2025 and converted pilots into multi-year deals. D'Souza also advised his fellow founders to “focus on the one core thing that you do 100X better.” AWS re:Invent connects you with global leaders, builders, and innovators.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: This series profiles six of the Seattle region's “Uncommon Thinkers”: inventors, scientists, technologists and entrepreneurs transforming industries and driving positive change in the world. Uncommon Thinkers is presented in partnership with Greater Seattle Partners. Now he's working on an idea those billionaires never thought to pursue: building a spacecraft powered by the heat of focused sunlight. Thornburg and his teammates are aiming to make Bothell-based Portal the first commercial venture to capitalize on solar thermal propulsion, a technology studied decades ago by NASA and the U.S. Air Force. The technology is more fuel-efficient than traditional chemical propulsion — and faster-acting than solar electric propulsion, which uses solar arrays to turn sunlight into electricity to power an ion drive. “They didn't abandon it for technical reasons,” Thornburg said. “Lower launch costs, coupled with additive manufacturing, are the major unlocks to bring the tech to life, and make it affordable and in line with commercial development,” Thornburg said. Thornburg argues that it's the right time for Portal's spacecraft to fill a gap in America's national security posture on the high frontier. “There was no imperative for rapid movement on orbit in the 1990s,” he said. “Only recently have the threats from our adversaries highlighted the weaknesses in current electric propulsion systems, in that they have so little thrust and can't enable rapid mobility.” And next year, Portal is due to demonstrate its hardware for the first time in orbit. Thornburg, who's now 52 years old, has focused on making things fly for most of his career. It all started when he was a college student in Missouri in the early 1990s, earning his aerospace engineering degree with an ROTC scholarship from the Air Force. “With my nearsightedness, I was out of the game from a pilot standpoint,” Thornburg said. Thornburg signed up for a program that fast-tracked him into an aircraft maintenance role. During his time as a flight commander and aircraft maintenance officer at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, “I had a couple of hundred enlisted people who worked hard to keep me out of trouble,” he said. The Air Force is where he earned his master's degree in aerospace engineering. “My adviser had a friend that worked at the Air Force Research Lab,” Thornburg recalled. “He called him and said, ‘The Air Force is about to send this guy to do something with airplanes, but I'm pretty sure he's going to be disappointed if he can't come out and work on rocket engines. Sure enough, Thornburg was soon working on rocket propulsion development, including a project to create what's known as a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine. In 2004, Thornburg left the Air Force to work on rocket propulsion systems at Exquadrum, Aerojet and NASA. Then, in 2011, he took a phone call from SpaceX's billionaire founder, Elon Musk. “We talked for about an hour, hour and a half on the phone — and he said, ‘I've got a project I want to talk to you about,'” Thornburg said. After five years at SpaceX, Thornburg needed to wind down. He decided to do some consulting at his home base in Huntsville, Alabama, also known as Rocket City. “And some friends of mine introduced me to, ultimately, Paul Allen. Paul called me and said, ‘Can you come out to my Seattle office? Unfortunately, Allen passed away in 2018, just one month after the engine was unveiled. Once again, Thornburg and his family hunkered down in Huntsville. “I decided to start my first space company after Paul died,” Thornburg said. That first company, Interstellar Technologies, started working on projects for NASA, Northrop Grumman and a couple of other customers. “The investors that were about to provide funding disappeared,” Thornburg said. And so I had to find my small team other jobs.” “That's ultimately what got us moved to Seattle,” Thornburg said. His yearlong stint at Amazon was long enough to establish the process for building Project Kuiper's two prototypes and the production-grade satellites that came after them. Then he took on engineering management roles at Agility Robotics and Commonwealth Fusion Systems. To be fair, the seeds for Portal were planted back in 2016, just weeks after Thornburg left SpaceX. “Lawrence Livermore Lab had called and said, ‘We're doing a seminar on the future of propulsion. “I said, ‘Yes, what do you want me to talk about?' They said, ‘We want you to tell us what the future of propulsion looks like.' The concept, known as nuclear thermal propulsion, seemed like a stretch — but then Thornburg had an uncommon thought. “Can you concentrate solar energy to heat a thrust chamber and do the same thing?” Thornburg said. “When Portal could really start to stand on its own, as we started to win over the Defense Department, that's when I made the switch with all of my time focused on what was going on in Portal,” Thornburg said. And it should be able to do that within hours or a day, rather than the weeks or months that are typically required. To concentrate sunlight on its heat exchanger and thruster system, Supernova will use sheets of reflective material that can unfold to a width of roughly 55 feet. The 3D-printed heat exchanger thruster, dubbed Flare, was successfully tested earlier this year. In late 2026, Portal plans to send up a free-flying spacecraft called Starburst, which will be equipped with thrusters powered by an electrothermal heating system. Starburst won't be as powerful as Supernova, but it will provide Portal's customers with an early option for rapid maneuverability in orbit. If next year's test goes well, Starburst is expected to start taking on customer missions in 2027. Throughout Portal's formative years, Thornburg has worked with fellow members of the “small team” he assembled at Interstellar Technologies. Both of Portal's other co-founders — chief operating officer Ian Vorbach and engineering vice president Prashaanth Ravindran — crossed paths with Thornburg at Interstellar, and at Stratolaunch before that. Vorbach, whose background includes startup experience as well as engineering experience, said Portal's business model has been fine-tuned to make sure it addresses the needs of its target market. “What happens a lot in the space industry is that you have incredibly technical, talented people who have a technology that provides some very unique performance, and then they build it, and it turns out that performance isn't needed,” Vorbach said. “We work very long hours, but I think Jeff does a great job of making sure people know that they're valued,” he said. “I appreciate that, and I think it's why we, fortunately, are able to hire great talent from the places he's come from, whether it's SpaceX or Kuiper.” Stan Shull, a space industry analyst at Bellevue, Wash.-based Alliance Velocity, gives Portal high marks. Thornburg's experience and expertise are big factors behind Portal's rapid progress, Shull said. “I think there are some very interesting things happening in our understanding of quantum physics that will have propulsion applications, that won't look like propulsion as we know it right now,” he said. “If we could fold spacetime in clever ways … there's been plenty of writing about that.” But when he takes a more realistic look at what could happen in his lifetime, Thornburg can't stop thinking about nuclear propulsion. “Nuclear thermal will get us further into the solar system, and this Earth-moon-Mars becomes our backyard,” he said. “But, you know, for my 12-year-old version of myself, that's not enough.” Greater Seattle Partners is the region's public-private economic development organization uniting business, government, and community leaders to promote Greater Seattle on the global stage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sam Ransbotham teaches a class in machine learning as a professor of business analytics at Boston College, and what he's witnessing in the classroom both excites and terrifies him. Some students are using AI tools to create and accomplish amazing things, learning and getting more out of the technology than he could have imagined. But in other situations, he sees a concerning trend: students “phoning things into the machine.” Boston College provides premier tools to students at no cost, to ensure that socioeconomics aren't the differentiator in the classroom. But Ransbotham, who hosts the “Me, Myself and AI” podcast from MIT Sloan Management Review, worries about “a divide in technology interest.” “The deeper that someone is able to understand tools and technology, the more that they're able to get out of those tools,” he explained.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last month, Kentucky attorney general Russell Coleman announced the details of yet another lawsuit against Roblox over suspected pedophiles lurking on the hugely popular gaming platform. While doing so, Coleman singled out the work of one self-described “predator hunter” who claims to have helped identify alleged abusers mixing with young gamers. “Roblox is even trying to silence those who raised these security risks,” Coleman said. Schlep is in fact Michael, a 22-year-old Texan who has spent the last two years working with a group of other Roblox players to track down and identify people purportedly seeking to groom young children on the platform—predators like the one Schlep says allegedly groomed him a decade ago, which he says led him to try to take his own life. But on August 8, Schlep received a cease-and-desist letter from Roblox, and instantly, all of his accounts were banned. “While Roblox acknowledges that your stated intentions may be to protect children, and while it recognizes the serious nature of online predatory behavior, your methods, including failing to immediately report suspicious activity to Roblox through proper channels, are actively interfering with Roblox's established safety protocols and, critically, are exposing Roblox's users to increased risk,” the company wrote in the letter reviewed by WIRED. Over the past four months, several states have launched high-profile legal actions alleging that the gaming platform has become a hunting ground for pedophiles preying on its youngest and most vulnerable users. In August, Louisiana's attorney general filed a lawsuit alleging Roblox “knowingly enabled and facilitated the systemic sexual exploitation and abuse of children.” In October, Florida attorney general James Uthmeier issued criminal subpoenas to the company to assess whether it is “aiding predators in accessing and harming children.” And earlier this month, Texas attorney general Ken Paxton sued Roblox, alleging it is “putting pixel pedophiles and profits over the safety of Texas children.” On November 18, activist groups UltraViolet and ParentsTogether Action held a virtual protest inside Roblox to deliver a petition calling on company CEO David Baszucki to “put child safety before engagement metrics.” Roblox announced a new AI-powered age verification system in September and is now expanding it to include chat. Once they have identified someone they believe to be a pedophile, these vigilante groups typically lure their targets into real world meetings by pretending to be an underage boy or girl. “The only way this can really be viewed in my eyes is Roblox is trying to silence a critic who has exposed the insane flaw in their platform: that there are sexual predators everywhere,” Schlep says. “I think Roblox wants to make an example of me.” Despite these pedophile hunting groups' stated intentions of protecting children, extremism researchers and law enforcement officials have criticized their methods for being focused on gaining more followers rather than securing prosecutions. Some have also faced their own criminal charges; The New York Times reported in March that pedophile hunters were behind over 170 violent vigilante attacks since 2023. “That's why we work with law enforcement to hold bad actors accountable.” In light of his ban, a massive #FreeSchlep movement has sprung up online, with supporters posting on social media as well as holding virtual protests on Roblox. Some of the biggest Roblox influencers, including Kindly Keyin and ThinkNoodles—who have 5.8 million and 12.2 million subscribers on YouTube, respectively—have publicly left the company's partner program this fall in solidarity with Schlep. While Schlep was recovering in a hospital, he claims his mother contacted Roblox about the situation, but he says she was “brushed off.” Roblox did not respond to multiple requests for comment about this incident. In 2023, Schlep decided to take things into his own hands and began posting to his YouTube channel about the alleged grooming and sexual exploitation on the platform. “There were communities of people trading child pornography for Roblox's in-game currency, Robux. They put up on group walls where anybody could view, ‘I will pay five Robux for cheese pizza,' which stands for child pornography.” He says these groups were accessible to kids. In leaked emails, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta referenced pizza, which users of fringe online message boards like 4chan falsely claimed was code for child sexual abuse material. So-called condo games “refers to sex communities on Roblox, and these Discord communities would be dedicated to bypassing the rules of Roblox,” Schlep says. “People would upload these graphic sex games with animations and everything. It would just be like a game of whack-a-mole for Roblox.” Schlep began interacting with what he alleges are potential predators not on Roblox but on Discord, where a quick search, he claims, would allow him to find servers dedicated to people looking for partners with whom to play condo games. Discord did not respond to WIRED's request for comment, but it appears it may have recently made it more difficult for users to find these condo servers, and WIRED was unable to easily locate them on the platform. Schlep claims he would then work with pedophile hunter groups like Predator Poachers to conduct a sting operation where he says they lure the alleged predator into confessing on camera, something that can happen both before and after the police show up. Of the six alleged predators arrested following stings by Schlep and his team, none have so far been convicted, Schlep says, and at least one of them has not proceeded to prosecution, while two others are heading for plea deals. “A lot of these people are doing what they're doing because there's a void, because no one else is addressing the problem,” Gould says. In a blog post explaining the new rules, Matt Kaufman, Roblox's chief safety officer, wrote that “on multiple occasions” the company had observed vigilante groups refraining from reporting issues to Roblox until after they had posted about it on social media in order to boost their own followings. Impersonation means I'm taking the identity of a real kid. We create new identities, and everyone is above the age of 18, but we just pretend that we're a minor.” He also says he's the only person to have his accounts banned by Roblox; his team members have not been punished. The company did not respond to a request for comment on what it meant by “impersonating children” and whether it had banned other accounts since implementing its new rules. The controversy around Schlep comes as law firms across the country are prepping hundreds of lawsuits on behalf of parents of young children who all allege they were groomed or exploited, and in some cases even kidnapped and sexually assaulted. His YouTube channel has grown its following significantly since the ban, and he is now collaborating with Chris Hansen, the journalist who previously hosted the To Catch a Predator segment on Dateline NBC and is currently working on an investigation into alleged predators on Roblox. “It shouldn't be so open and accessible, that's the main issue here,” Schlep alleges of Roblox's platform. “The fact that you can just search up a term on Roblox and you're able to join a sex game, that's just ridiculous. If Disney or Lego or any other of these children's companies were held to the same standards, they would be getting crucified in the media.</p>

It arrives amid continued U.S.export restrictions on high-end GPU hardware and reflects a growing shift inside China toward software-side efficiency gains as a stopgap for constrained silicon supply. Aside from being equipped to help China “...create an analogue AI chip 1000 times faster than Nvidia's chips,” Huawei claims Flex:ai can raise average utilization by around 30%. It reportedly does this by slicing individual GPU or NPU cards into multiple virtual compute instances and orchestrating workloads across heterogeneous hardware types. Smaller tasks that might otherwise underuse a full accelerator are stacked alongside one another, while larger models that exceed the capacity of a single device can span multiple cards. The tool includes a smart scheduler, dubbed Hi Scheduler, that redistributes idle resources across nodes in real time, automatically reassigning compute to wherever AI workloads are queued. Flex:ai's architecture builds on existing open-source Kubernetes foundations but extends them in ways that are still uncommon across open deployments. Kubernetes already supports device plugins to expose accelerators and schedulers, such as Volcano, or frameworks like Ray can perform fractional allocation and gang scheduling. Flex:ai appears to unify them at a higher layer while integrating support for Ascend NPUs alongside standard GPU hardware. The launch resembles functionality offered by Run:ai, an orchestration platform acquired by Nvidia in 2024, which enables multi-tenant scheduling and workload pre-emption across large GPU clusters. That may give it broader relevance in clusters built around Chinese silicon, particularly those using Ascend chips. When it does become available, key questions will include the granularity of slicing, how Flex:ai interacts with standard Kubernetes schedulers, and, crucially, whether it supports widely used GPU types via standard plugins.

The entrepreneur has reminded people (and investors) via an X post that Tesla has had an "advanced AI chip and board engineering team" for several years now. He goes on to state that the chips coming out of this project will make Tesla "the leader in real-world AI," as bold a claim as any, and that the firm plans to make more AI chips than all other chipmakers, combined. Musk claims this engineering team has already deployed millions of "AI chips" in cars and data centers. The technologist goes on to specify that Tesla currently uses its own AI4 chips in its cars and is close to taping out AI5. Going a step further, he states it expects Tesla to have a new iteration ready every 12 months, but more importantly, that it expects to "build chips at higher volumes ultimately than all other AI chips combined," a statement that merits some healthy skepticism, given how many chips Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, et al currently produce. These chips are what enable Tesla to be the leader in real-world AI.The…November 23, 2025 Tesla is currently a customer of TSMC and Samsung, and has expressed interest in working with Intel's foundries, given the current situation with worldwide chip supply constraints. Musk is considering building his own TeraFab chip factory, too. The design schedule also seems quite aggressive, but not impossible, given how much money has been poured into neural network accelerator chip design lately. As befits a grand presentation, Musk goes on to connect the company's AI developments to the Optimus robotics project, claiming the new chips will "save millions of lives" thanks to advanced medical care via unspecified integration with Tesla's Optimus project. The predictions about Optimus' abilities can be arguably quite optimistic, as well (pun unintended). In 2024, Musk stated the Optimus robots would be working in Tesla factories this year, and as of this writing, no public demonstrations have been made about these capabilities. In fact, just last summer, it seemed that Optimus robot production came to a grinding halt. Having said that, it's worth keeping in mind that Elon Musk also owns xAI, a company with actual released and working products, namely the Grok chatbot, the Aurora image generator, and DeepSearch engines. It should be a safe enough assumption that Tesla and xAI are sharing technology, perhaps somewhat enabling Musk's ideals of assistant doctor robots.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Photos appearing to show Elon Musk and several other Big Tech CEOs have gone viral in the past week on X and Bluesky. The mundane environments, including humble apartments and McDonald's parking lots, should have given everyone a hint that they're fake. But there's a new way for the average person to check for themselves whether the images were made with AI. Right off the bat, it should be said that the vast majority of AI image detectors are not reliable. Many people think you can use tools that are openly available on the web and figure out if a given image is AI. For example, people often ask Grok on X whether a photo was created with generative artificial intelligence. And it frequently gets the answer wrong. Google developed an AI watermark called SynthID a couple of years ago, but the company didn't allow the average user to check whether an image had the watermark. That changed just a few days ago. Now anyone can upload an image to Gemini and ask if it has the SynthID watermark, which is invisible to the naked eye. The watermark is embedded in the pixels and every image created with Google's AI creation tools will have it. If you see an image and want to confirm it has been made by Google AI, upload it to the Gemini app and ask a question such as: “Was this created with Google AI?” or “Is this AI-generated?” Gemini will check for the SynthID watermark and use its own reasoning to return a response that gives you more context about the content you encounter online. Obviously Gemini is less equipped to tell you if an image is AI if it wasn't made with Google tools like Nano Banana Pro. And that's the entire reason the company appears to be launching SynthID detection in Gemini in this moment. Nano Banana Pro launched last week and it's allowing users to make incredibly realistic images, including images of Elon Musk and other tech CEOs that look very real. Some of those images have recently gone viral, like one that racked up nearly 9 million views on X before migrating to other platforms like Bluesky. There are a lot of different versions circulating. If you run any of these images through Gemini it confirms they all have the SynthID watermark. If you're wondering whether an image appears too weird to be true, it's probably a good idea to check with Gemini. Did you see that viral image of President Donald Trump with Bill “Bubba” Clinton in a very compromising position? Gemini won't necessarily be able to ID every AI image with certainty. Fake images are still going to be everywhere in the current social media environment. But at least Google has given the average user a new tool to identify at least some of the fakes for themselves. Sometimes you just need to apply some common sense. For example, do you think Elon Musk and Sam Altman would be hanging out in a parking lot together? Then again, it seemed very unlikely that Musk and President Trump would become friendly again after the Tesla CEO accused Trump of being in the Epstein files.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The data center industry is booming, as cloud providers seek to scale up their services to keep pace with demand driven by AI. Outside of Virginia, there is no other place in the U.S. with a higher concentration of server farms than the Lone Star state (it has over 400 data centers, currently). Now, a new report claims that all these data centers may be driving up the risk of winter blackouts which, under the right circumstances, could prove life-threatening. NBC News originally reported on a new report put out this week by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), a non-profit based in Georgia that monitors risks to the U.S. electrical grid. NERC's report notes that strong “load growth from new data centers and other large industrial end users is driving higher winter electricity demand forecasts and contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.” Electricity demand is obviously higher during colder times of year, as the estimated 42 percent of Americans who rely on electricity for heating crank up the dial when the temperature outside drops. Data centers put more pressure on a system that is already under strain, the report notes, writing: For the upcoming winter season, Texas RE-ERCOT is expected to continue facing reserve shortage risks during the peak load hour and high-net-load hours, particularly under extreme load conditions that accompany freezing temperatures. Elevated forced outage of thermal resources and reduced output from intermittent resources during these conditions exacerbates the risk of supply shortfalls. In addition to the hundreds of data centers that already exist in Texas, the state also has projects in development—although skeptics say it won't be feasible for all of those projects to actually get built. NBC writes that there has been a huge increase in projects requesting connection to the Texas grid over the past year: If all of those projects were actually built, they would be equivalent to the average annual power consumption of nearly 154 million homes in Texas, according to a CNBC analysis based on 2024 household electricity data. But the Lone Star state only has a population of about 30 million people. Beth Garza, a former head of ERCOT's watchdog, said she is very skeptical these projects will all get built, describing the scale of the numbers as “crazy big.” More than half the projects have not submitted planning studies, according to ERCOT. As the AI revolution continues, unforeseen side-effects will continue to pop up. I suppose disruptions to the electrical grid are just one more price we may all have to pay so that humanity can have chatbots that can rap. Don't tell your loved ones you let a bot pick their gift.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India has granted legal status to millions of gig and platform workers under its newly implemented labor laws, marking a milestone for the country's delivery, ride-hailing, and e-commerce workforce — yet with benefits still unclear and platforms beginning to assess their obligations, access to social security remains out of reach. It is the only part of the new framework that addresses gig and platform workers, as the remaining three codes — covering wages, industrial relations, and workplace safety — do not extend minimum earnings, employment protections, or working-condition guarantees to this rapidly expanding workforce. India has one of the world's largest and fastest-growing gig economies, with industry estimates suggesting that more than 12 million people deliver food, drive ride-hailing cabs, sort e-commerce packages, and perform other on-demand services for digital platforms. Yet despite powering some of India's most valuable tech businesses, most gig workers operate outside traditional labor protections and lack access to basic social security. The Code on Social Security creates a legal framework for gig workers to be covered under schemes such as the Employees' State Insurance, provident fund, and government-backed insurance. “We need to wait and see what exactly is in the government's mind when it comes to implementing the four Codes, and what it hopes to do for gig workers,” said Balaji Parthasarathy, a professor at IIIT Bangalore and principal investigator of the Fairwork India project. That raises the possibility of uneven access, as some states move quickly to establish social security boards and roll out mechanisms, while others delay or deprioritize the effort due to political or fiscal constraints. Recent examples — such as Rajasthan's stalled legislation after it was passed in 2023, and Karnataka's Gig Workers Act, which was implemented soon after clearing the state assembly — underscore how workers' protections may ultimately depend on where they live rather than the law itself. Platform companies have publicly welcomed the reform, but are still largely evaluating what it will require of them. Food delivery firm Eternal, formerly known as Zomato, said in a stock exchange filing that the Social Security Code is a step toward more uniform rules and that it does not expect the financial impact to threaten its long-term business. Nonetheless, Aprajita Rana, a partner at corporate law firm AZB & Partners, said the change “will naturally have a financial impact” on India's e-commerce sector, as worker contributions are now being formalized. It will also create new compliance obligations, requiring companies to ensure all workers in their networks are registered with the government-managed fund, determine whether individuals are associated with multiple aggregators and how to avoid duplicative benefits, and set up internal grievance mechanisms. Trade unions, including the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers (IFAT), which has more than 70,000 members, are working to help gig workers enroll so they can access the benefits. Ambika Tandon, a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge and an affiliate of the national trade union Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said registering on the portal could mean lost wages for gig workers, since they would have to take time off to fill in required details. “They don't have time to go and register themselves on the government portal.” The benefits of registering on the E-Shram portal are not compelling for many gig workers, Tandon noted, because the law does not address more immediate concerns such as fluctuating earnings, account suspensions, and sudden termination of accounts — issues that workers say matter far more right now than access to insurance or provident fund benefits. However, such actions can disrupt everyone involved, including consumers, and put workers at further risk, as they are not paid while striking and may even face termination for participating. “While the social security rules have now been put in place, we demand a minimum wage and an employer-employee relationship for gig and platform workers, which are yet to be set by the government,” said Shaik Salauddin, founder president of the Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union (TGPWU), which has more than 10,000 members in the southern state of Telangana, and national general secretary of IFAT. The Social Security Code defines gig and platform workers as a separate category, rather than extending them the rights and protections that come with employee status. In some U.S. jurisdictions, regulators and courts have pushed for platform workers to be treated as employees or similarly protected workers, though many ride-hail and delivery drivers remain classified as independent contractors. “With this law, the Indian government has settled this debate by saying that these gig workers do not sit within the ambit of employment or other protections,” Tandon said.

It's fairly easy to "temporarily" tie in to other units' utilities, whether power or water... it was only this past summer that I've had to put a lock on our utility closet (various "misunderstandings").Beginning summer 2024 a shanty-town started establishing itself just the next block over (just outside city limits)... which is worrysome but only for the winter fire risk (seem like mostly down-on-luck working-types).The previous summer there were a couple months of heavy car repo activity... us commoners are still hanging on, but I fear we won't remain not poorer for too much longer.

For the first time, both have a visible, noticeable homeless population. I have also noticed other encampments well outside of Quebec city and Montreal.In Berlin, the homeless population has also exploded, and is expected to get much worse. My friends in the US report similar changes.Things are getting significantly worse all over, it seems. In Berlin, the homeless population has also exploded, and is expected to get much worse.
