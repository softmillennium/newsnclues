The AI chip giant was down as much as 7% in early trading, then recovered some of that loss in midday trading. Google's parent Alphabet pared early gains, extending its recent surge toward a $4 trillion valuation. Nasdaq lagged behind the other major stock indexes as all three recovered from their morning lows. Shutdown-delayed economic data was also in focus. Retail sales rose 0.2% in September from August, undershooting expectations, while producer prices ticked up 0.3%, in line with forecasts. Rising expectations for a cut have buoyed markets in recent days. A separate weekly report from ADP indicated the private sector shed 13,500 jobs a week in the four weeks through Nov. 8.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>McALLEN, Texas (AP) — Yaakub Vijandre was preparing to go to work as a mechanic when six vehicles appeared outside his Dallas-area home. The Trump administration said it targeted Vijandre over social media posts. The freelance videographer and pro-Palestinian activist described his early October arrest to his attorneys, who relayed the information to reporters. His arrest and several others this year signal a change in how the U.S. is handling DACA recipients as President Donald Trump's administration reshapes immigration policy more broadly. The change comes as immigrants have face increased vetting, including of their social media, when they apply for visas, green cards, citizenship, or to request the release of their children from federal custody. The administration also has sought to deport foreign students for participating in pro-Palestinian activism. It also allows them to legally work in the U.S. Previously if their status was in jeopardy, they would receive a warning and would still have a chance to fight it before immigration officers detained them and began efforts to deport them. In response to questions about any changes, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement saying that people “who claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are not automatically protected from deportations. DACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country.” DACA recipients can lose status “for a number of reasons, including if they've committed a crime,” she said. Vijandre is among about 20 DACA recipients who have been arrested or detained by immigration authorities since Trump took office in January, according to Home is Here, a campaign created by pro-DACA advocacy groups. The administration is seeking to end his DACA status, which could result in him being deported to the Philippines, a home he has not visited since his family came to the U.S. in 2001, when he was 14. There have been other attempts to end the program or place restrictions on recipients. This year, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that would deny work permits for DACA recipients who live in Texas. The Trump administration recently presented its plans to a federal judge who is determining how it will work. The administration also has issued new restrictions on commercial driver's licenses that would prevent DACA recipients and some other immigrants from getting them. Last year, 19 Republican states stripped DACA recipients' access to health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. And the number of states where immigrant students can qualify for in-state tuition has dwindled since the Justice Department began suing states this year. “This administration might not be trying to end DACA altogether the way that they did the first time around, but they are chipping away at it,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, spokesperson for United We Dream, which is part of Home is Here, the coalition keeping track of public cases of DACA recipients who have been detained. Susana Lujano, left, a dreamer from Mexico who lives in Houston, joins other activists to rally in support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington on June 15, 2022. Catalina “Xóchitl” Santiago Santiago, a 28-year-old activist from El Paso, Texas, was arrested in August despite showing immigration officers a valid work permit obtained through DACA. Days later, federal officers arrested Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira as the 28-year-old father was arriving at his El Paso home with his children following a doctor's appointment. Marisa Ong, an attorney for Santiago and Gamez Lira, said the government failed to notify either of her clients of any intention to terminate their DACA status. “DACA recipients have a constitutionally protected interest in their continued liberty,” Ong said, adding that “the government cannot take away that liberty without providing some valid reason.” DACA recipients can lose their status if they are convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanors like those involving harming others, driving under the influence or drug distribution, or three or more misdemeanors. DHS claimed in a statement that Santiago was previously charged with trespassing, possession of narcotics and drug paraphernalia and that Gamez Lira was previously arrested for marijuana possession. Ong said that when attorneys sought their release “the government presented no evidence of any past misconduct by either individual.” His attorneys say he received notice two weeks before his arrest that the government planned to terminate his DACA status but that he wasn't given a chance to fight it. “I think that the administration has drawn a very clear line and at least for right now, between citizen and noncitizens, and their goal is to remove as many noncitizens from the country as possible and to make it as difficult as possible for noncitizens to enter the country,” Godshall-Bennett, Vijandre's attorney, said.</p>

Thompson came in second place by just one point to Booker in the open women's category (no weight requirement). Andrea Thompson (left) finished second to an alleged transgender athlete at the 2025 World's Strongest Woman competition. A video showed Thompson stepping off the podium appearing to say, "This is bulls---." According to Strongman Archives, Booker had not competed in women's events prior to this past June. It is unclear whether Booker had previously competed as a man. After backlash over the previous 48 hours, Official Strongman announced that Booker would be "disqualified," admitting it was unaware of allegations that Booker was born male. "Had we been aware, or had this been declared at any point before or during the competition, this athlete would not have been permitted to compete in the Woman's Open category. We are clear - competitors can only compete in the category for the biological sex recorded at birth," Official Strongman said in an announcement Tuesday. "Official Strongman is inclusive and proud to run events which do not discriminate against athletes based on personal characteristics. But it is our responsibility to ensure fairness and ensure athletes are assigned to men or women's categories based on whether they are recorded as male or female at birth." Thompson shared a post from her coach, Laurence Shahlaei, congratulating her on "winning" the event. Shahlaei told Fox News Digital just prior to Strongman's announcement that he had been told Thompson would be crowned the champion and that an official announcement would be made. "This win hasn't come without controversy, but I want to make it very clear that while I support and applaud people for being who they want to be, sport is sport and the women's classes exist for a reason," Shahlaei wrote. Jammie Booker is on record in having competed in just three Official Strongman events, winning two. She won the Masters World's Strongest Woman event, reserved for women 40 years or older. On Sept. 14, Booker began a GoFundMe for help get money to compete in the competition. "After taking 1st in the Rainier Classic regional (and getting my pro card) and 2nd at the North America's Strongest Woman competition, I have qualified for the next level of competition at the Official Strongman Games and I have a good chance of reaching the podium at this event as well," Booker wrote. Registration fees are $285, the flight to Texas will be around $350, and the hotel fees for the 3 day competition and pre competition rules meeting will be $900. I simply cannot afford this on my shoestring planet fitness trainer budget. Winning this competition will open huge doors for my career both as an athlete and as a trainer." Strongman said it has attempted to reach out to Booker, "but a response has not been received." On Monday, Booker posted a video to Instagram thanking numerous people for their assistance in what was originally a victory. Booker's first post on Instagram is a photo posing at a Planet Fitness on July 31, 2022. Follow Fox News Digital's sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Former NFL star Trent Green talks to Fox News Digital about Shedeur Sanders' first start as an NFL pro. Kosar, who was released a day before his 62nd birthday, said he feels like a "walking miracle." "There was no way I thought I was going to be here for my 62nd birthday," Kosar said during a press conference on Monday, according to Cleveland.com. "There was no way I thought I was going to be healthy, let alone walking out of here." Browns all-time great quarterback Bernie Kosar is introduced to the fans prior to the game against the New England Patriots at FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio, on Oct. 16, 2022. "I feel like a walking miracle." Kosar revealed that he needed a transplant after he was diagnosed with liver failure in July 2024 in an interview with Cleveland Magazine. After being put on a transplant list in the spring of 2024, Kosar received a new liver on Nov. 17. It came from 21-year-old Bryce Dunlap, who had died from complications of an anoxic brain injury the day before. Bernie Kosar and Tom Brady stand on the field prior to a game between the Dallas Cowboys and Browns in Cleveland, Ohio, on Sept. 8, 2024. Dunlap, who the family says was a huge Browns and Cleveland sports fan, would be celebrating from heaven that he saved someone's life, according to the family. "We are so happy for Bernie being released so he can continue to recover in comfort. We truly believe that Bryce is looking down and is so proud that he helped a Browns legend. Bryce was an amazing boy with the biggest heart," the Dunlap family said in a statement to 3news.com Upon being told the story of how Kosar got his liver, the Browns' legend became emotional. "I'm trying not to cry, first. "Yes, he's looking down on me, and I'm so thankful for that. I know that sounds corny or out there; I feel him within me. I just love him and his family. He was named to his lone Pro Bowl with the Browns but won the Super Bowl with the Dallas Cowboys in 1993.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Consumer confidence for November fell to its lowest level since April as Americans expressed concern about what the future holds for their jobs, cost of living and the economy at large. Data for September retail sales and wholesale inflation landed Tuesday, several weeks delayed by the recent US government shutdown. But just when – or even if – the following months' retail sales and Producer Price Index reports will be released remains TBD. The federal statistical agencies are working their way through an unprecedented economic data backlog after the lengthy lapse in appropriations stymied efforts to collect, analyze and release reports for a month and a half. Instead, partial data will be released alongside the November reports. When economists and policymakers analyze inflation data, they often look to “core” indexes that strip out the categories of food and energy, which tend to be more volatile. This is better than the 0.3% monthly gain and 2.7% annual rate economists were expecting for core, according to FactSet consensus estimates. PPI doesn't translate directly to the inflation consumers see; however, sharp-rising goods prices – specifically in the areas of gasoline, food and electricity – could be foretelling that those key household purchases could get even pricier than they already are. Wall Street continued to waver Tuesday after a slew of economic data was released following the end of the government shutdown. On balance, traders focused on any sign that the latest economic news would boost the chances of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve when policymakers meet in a couple of weeks. Some Fed officials have in recent days telegraphed their intention to trim rates at the next meeting, invigorating markets. Traders are currently pricing in a chance of more than 80% that the central bank will ease off. But the tech sector still continued to struggle Tuesday, with AI darling Nvidia falling by around 4% on news that Meta was mulling purchasing chips from Alphabet. America's economic mood is souring as worries about the labor market mount. The Conference Board's latest survey of American consumers, released Tuesday, showed that consumer confidence declined sharply this month to a reading of 88.7, the lowest level since April, when President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs. “Consumers' write-in responses pertaining to factors affecting the economy continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade, and politics, with increased mentions of the federal government shutdown,” Dana Peterson, the Conference Board's chief economist, said in a release. The government shutdown ended earlier this month, so consumer confidence could rebound in December. “Mid-2026 expectations for labor market conditions remained decidedly negative, and expectations for increased household incomes shrunk dramatically, after six months of strongly positive readings,” Peterson said. There have been high-profile announcements of layoffs in recent weeks, but that doesn't immediately translate into higher unemployment, which was at a low 4.4% rate in September, according to the latest Labor Department data. Tuesday's PPI data indicated that some firms are shielding their customers from the brunt of the steep and blunt tariffs on imported goods, wrote Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He noted the trade services category, which tends to be quite volatile, measures profit margins for wholesalers and retailers. So, economists have been watching that category closely as a potential indication for how much businesses might be absorbing some of the tariff costs versus passing them along to consumers. “But the picture differs markedly by sector, with auto retailers accepting substantially lower margins, while most other retailers are passing on all the rise in acquisition prices to consumers,” Tombs wrote. For consumers, September PPI could mean better news if they're in the market for sneakers or sports equipment, less so if they're wanting to buy a new computer or TV. In addition to auto dealers, the industries showing some of the biggest hits to their margins (and potentially lower cost increases for the end consumer) included retailers of sporting goods, clothing, shoes and jewelry as well as wholesalers of machinery, paper and plastics, PPI data shows. Industries with the largest increases in margins (indicating higher costs are potentially being passed on to consumers) were retailers of TVs, video equipment, computers, furniture and flooring – categories where the US is heavily reliant on imports. “The Midwest shined above other regions due to better affordability, while contract signings retreated in the more expensive West region,” Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said in a release. “Days on the market typically lengthen from November through February, providing better negotiating power to buyers during the holiday season.” Mortgage rates have been steadily declining since May, with the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage reaching this year's lowest point in late October. The S&P Cotality Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index rose 1.3% in September, S&P Global said Tuesday, slightly down from August's 1.4% gain. The index has been steadily weakening since 2022, when the Federal Reserve began to hike interest rates to tamp down inflation. The central bank is now lowering borrowing costs, with its benchmark lending rate at its lowest point in three years. “National home prices continued trailing inflation, with September's (Consumer Price Index) running 1.7 percentage points ahead of housing appreciation,” Nicholas Godec, head of fixed income tradables & commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in a release. Chicago, New York and Boston saw the strongest price gains in September, while home prices in Tampa, Phoenix, Dallas and Miami declined that month. “Markets that were pandemic darlings — particularly in Florida, Arizona, and Texas — are now experiencing outright price declines,” Godec said. “Meanwhile, traditionally stable metros in the Northeast and Midwest continue to post solid gains, suggesting a reversion to pre-pandemic patterns where job markets and urban fundamentals drive appreciation rather than migration trends and remote-work dynamics.” Stocks are coming off two days of strong gains as hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts have boosted markets. However, the S&P 500 and Dow are still on track for their first losing month since April. The Nasdaq is set for its first losing month since March. Investors were keen to see how aspects of the economy – like retail sales – fared in recent months. Investors have embraced hopes for Fed rate cuts after recent comments from central bank officials suggested a cut could be on the table. Treasury yields ticker lower Tuesday morning as investors leaned in to bets that the Fed will cut rates in December. Gold prices can rise when the Fed is expected to lower rates. Wholesale services prices were flat for the month. Within goods, categories such as meats, residential electric power and motor vehicles also moved higher. When taking energy out of the equation, as well as food, the underlying goods inflation trend perhaps shows a silver lining: “Core goods price gains slowed to 0.2% after a couple of larger pops, suggesting tariff pressure might be ebbing,” Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO, wrote Tuesday in a note to investors. The delayed data for September's Producer Price Index showed that core inflation is “moving away from the Fed's 2% target rate,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, in a note Tuesday. “There is not no inflation and it is higher than the 2.1% year-on-year rate for core factory goods when the president took office in January,” he wrote. Central bankers are split on whether they should lower interest rates again at their upcoming meeting in December. They've lowered rates twice this year, in September and October, each time by a quarter point, bringing their key interest rate to its lowest level in three years. And inflation at the wholesale level that month came in mostly as economists had expected. Sales at US retailers increased in September for the fourth consecutive month, boosted by low unemployment and a buoyant stock market. Retail sales, which account for about a third of overall spending, rose 0.2% in September, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That was a much slower pace than August's 0.6% gain. But after factoring in the 0.3% increase in prices that month, according to the Consumer Price Index for September, retail spending edged down 0.1%. Spending was up across half of categories in September, increasing the most at so-called miscellaneous retailers by a solid 2.9%. Sales also increased at restaurants and bars, rising 0.7%. In September, employers added jobs at a robust pace and unemployment ticked up but remained low. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in a biting rebuke of the Federal Reserve, said members of the central bank should quit commenting publicly about the potential direction of rate-setting policy and focus instead on listening to Americans who are struggling with high borrowing rates. “It's time for the Fed to move back into the background like it used to, calm things down, work for the American people, [and] set monetary policy on a good course,” Bessent said in an interview with CNBC Tuesday morning. Markets have moved – sometimes dramatically – in recent days after Fed governors and regional bank presidents commented on potential monetary policy decisions. “We know the economy hasn't gotten better,” he said. “I'm not even sure what the discussion is here.” US wholesale inflation picked up speed in September, an indication that prices could soon heat up even more for consumers. The shutdown-delayed Producer Price Index for September showed that prices increased 0.3% on a monthly basis, keeping the annual inflation rate at 2.7%. In August, wholesale prices fell 0.1% on a monthly basis, largely because of compressed profit margins. Economists were expecting that producer prices rose 0.3% from August and was 2.6% for the 12 months ended in September. Black Friday through Christmas will test America's economic strength. Preliminary reports look good: Early-bird holiday shoppers have been out in strong numbers this year, according to a report earlier this month from Bank of America. Middle- and lower-income folks, despite declaring that they're fed up with their financial situations, are also still spending, in aggregate. Stubborn inflation, combined with already-high prices, has forced people to shell out more for the holidays, pushing spending numbers up. It's one reason a poll published by Fox News this week showed 76% of Americans have a negative view of this economy, up from 67% in July. US companies have sharply slowed their hiring this year, hesitant to invest without knowing the full effects of President Donald Trump's sweeping economic policies. Yet workers' productivity, a key driver of economic output, remains high. That dichotomy of an expanding economy and a softening labor market presents a conundrum for policymakers at the Federal Reserve, complicating their efforts to determine whether the economy needs cooling or boosting. A growing economy, boosted by resilient consumers and massive investments in AI, should be spurring hiring, especially now that the Fed has started lowering borrowing costs. President Donald Trump and his economic team often respond to concerns about the affordability crisis by touting how much cheaper gasoline is than under his predecessor. The national average for regular gas stood at $3.055 on Tuesday, almost exactly the same as $3.056 a year ago under former President Joe Biden, according to AAA. In fact, Tuesday breaks an eight-day streak where the national average was up on a year-over-year basis, according to AAA data shared with CNN. It's a big shift from earlier this year, when gas was 30, 40 and even 50 cents cheaper than the same point in 2024. US stock futures were lower Tuesday morning as investors awaited a slew of economic data. Stocks are coming off two days in the green. The tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 2.69% on Monday, posting its best day since May. Wall Street is trying to discern whether the Federal Reserve will lower its benchmark interest rate at its policy meeting in December. Traders on Tuesday morning were pricing in an 81% chance that the Fed cuts rates, according to CME FedWatch. New York Fed President John Williams and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly in recent days have suggested they could support a rate cut in December, which helped send stocks higher on Friday and Monday. Stock investors like lower interest rates because it encourages spending and business activity, boosting corporate profits, while lowering bond yields, making stocks relatively more appealing. “During this holiday-shortened week, investors will receive a cornucopia of data now that the government is open again,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said in a note. “Some of the data will be a bit stale. Economists expect that producer prices likely rose 0.3% in September, which would be an acceleration from the preliminary 0.1% drop reported for August, a decline that was driven by compressed profit margins. The annual rate is expected to hold at 2.6%. While the federal government is starting to release delayed economic data following the record-breaking shutdown, it's becoming increasingly apparent that a lot of the data covering last month won't be published in its usual form. As a result, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced last week it will only be publishing limited October price data as opposed to the complete data included in monthly Consumer Price Index reports. The agency also said it won't be publishing an October jobs report. Rather, some of the data that would otherwise make it into that report will be included in the November report scheduled for December 16.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She didn't specify their suspected roles in the heist. People queue to enter Le Louvre museum Wednesday, Nov. 19, 2025 in Paris. PARIS (AP) — The Paris prosecutor announced four more arrests Tuesday in connection with the stunning heist at the Louvre Museum in October by a gang that made off with $102 million worth of jewels. The two men and two women taken into custody are from the Paris region and range in age from 31 to 40, said the prosecutor, Laure Beccuau, whose office is heading the investigation. Her statement didn't say what role they're suspected of having played in the Oct. 19 theft. French media report that one of those arrested, a 39-year-old already known to police services, is believed to be the fourth member of the team thought to have carried out the daring daylight robbery and is from Aubervilliers, a suburb north of Paris other suspects have connections with. The other three alleged members of the so-called “commando” team have been previously arrested and face preliminary charges of theft by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy. Their DNA has been found on the scene or on items linked to the robbery. A woman arrested in October is accused of complicity. The loot hasn't been recovered. It includes a diamond-and-emerald necklace Napoleon gave to Empress Marie-Louise, jewels tied to 19th-century Queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense, and Empress Eugénie's pearl-and-diamond tiara. The thieves took less than eight minutes to force their way into the museum and leave, using a freight lift to reach the building's window. Footage from museum cameras showed two broke into the ornate Apollo Gallery, cutting into the jewelry display cases with disc cutters and making off with the trove, while two riders on scooters whisked them away. The emerald-set imperial crown of Napoleon III's wife, Empress Eugénie, containing more than 1,300 diamonds, was later found outside the museum.</p>

The calls for a peace deal came as Russia launched a wave of attacks on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, overnight, with at least seven people killed in strikes that hit city buildings and energy infrastructure.

Firefighters put out the fire after a drone hit a multi-storey residential building during Russia's night drone attack in Kyiv, Ukraine, Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2025. KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A renewed U.S. push to end the war between Russia and Ukraine is gathering momentum, although some of the key issues remain unresolved, officials said Tuesday. The update was issued hours after Russia launched a wave of overnight attacks on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, with at least seven people killed in strikes that hit city buildings and energy infrastructure. A Ukrainian attack on southern Russia killed three people and damaged homes, authorities said. “Over the past week, the United States has made tremendous progress towards a peace deal by bringing both Ukraine and Russia to the table,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X. “There are a few delicate, but not insurmountable, details that must be sorted out and will require further talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the United States.” President Donald Trump's plan for ending the nearly four-year war emerged last week. It heavily favored Russia, prompting Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to quickly engage with American negotiators. European leaders, fearing for their own future amid Russian aggression but apparently sidelined by Trump in drawing up the proposals, scrambled to steer the negotiations toward accommodating their concerns. Senior U.S. and Ukrainian officials said progress was made at talks in Geneva held on Sunday toward ending the war. And we should seize this momentum,” he said during at a video conference meeting of countries, led by France and the U.K., that could help police any ceasefire with Russia. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said of the talks: “I do think we are moving in a positive direction and indications today that in large part the majority of the text, (Zelenskyy) is indicating, can be accepted.” U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll met with Russian officials for several hours in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on Tuesday, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, declined to give details on how long the negotiations would last or what topics were being discussed, but noted that the Ukrainians were aware of the meeting and all sides have indicated they wanted to reach a deal to halt the fighting as quickly as possible. Zelenskyy said late Monday that “the list of necessary steps to end the war can become workable,”He said that he planned to discuss “sensitive” outstanding issues with Trump. Rustem Umerov, a senior adviser to Zelenskyy, posted on X on Tuesday that Zelenskyy hoped to finalize a deal with Trump “at the earliest suitable date in November.” Russian officials have been reserved in their comments on the peace plan. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday that Moscow is in touch with U.S. officials about peace efforts. European leaders have cautioned that the road to peace will be long. Local residents react as they watch their burning home after a drone hit a multi-storey residential building during Russia's night drone attack in Kyiv, Ukraine, Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2025. Russia fired 22 missiles of various types and more than 460 drones at Ukraine overnight, Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram. The strikes knocked out water, electricity and heat in parts of Kyiv. Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said 20 people were wounded in Kyiv. The Russian Defense Ministry said that it targeted military-industrial facilities and energy assets. Petrivna said that she didn't believe in the peace plan now under discussion. “No one will ever do anything about it,” she said. Russian President Vladimir Putin “won't stop until he finishes us off.” The overnight Ukrainian drone attack on Russia's southern region of Krasnodar was “one of the longest and most massive” and wounded six people, Gov.</p>

In another, it may be preparing to start one. While Washington pushes proposals aimed at easing Russia's terms for a cease-fire with Ukraine in Europe, it's taking a far tougher stance in the Western Hemisphere — moving to label Venezuela's military-linked Cartel de los Soles a terrorist organization and quietly expanding its military footprint in the Caribbean. President Donald Trump has reportedly approved CIA covert measures inside Venezuela — operations that often precede military force — and U.S. planners have already drawn up target lists for cartel sites, according to The New York Times. Many believe the U.S. could soon launch direct strikes on Venezuelan territory aimed at pushing Nicolás Maduro out of power. Many believe the U.S. could soon launch direct strikes on Venezuelan territory aimed at pushing Nicolás Maduro out of power. At the same time, a top Russian commander, Colonel General Oleg Makarevich, has been reassigned from the Ukrainian front to head Russia's Equator Task Force in Venezuela, overseeing roughly 120 troops training Venezuelan forces, Ukrainian intelligence chief Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told The War Zone. Fox News Digital has not independently verified Budanov's claim. Seth Krummrich, a retired U.S. Army colonel and vice president at Global Guardian, said Russian military advisers are indeed operating inside Venezuela but doubted Moscow would back Maduro militarily. "But Russia needs to stop the massive blood-letting of its young men in Ukraine. They're not going to go toe-to-toe with us militarily." He added that the relationship is long-standing: "There is a long history of Russian military advisers in Cuba and in Venezuela that goes on for decades." "Venezuela, for the longest time, has been a launch pad for Chinese, Russian, and Iranian influence in the Western Hemisphere," Krummrich said. "These chess pieces are all tied together when you arch your great-power competition." Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), spoke with Fox News Digital and said any overlap may be more coincidence than strategy. "We've been zigging and zagging in Venezuela," Berg said. "Trump has gone back and forth between build-ups and calls for dialogue, while the Russia timeline has only recently become parallel to these events. Russia's footprint in Latin America has grown only modestly since the early 2000s, dwarfed by China's economic expansion. Beyond them, its influence is exercised mainly through media and selective economic pressure. "If you look at Russia's trade profile with the region, it's small," Berg said. "But Moscow is very good at using those few trade points for leverage." Russia continues to service aging equipment across the region. "They sell a lot of kit here," Berg added. "Many countries still operate Russian-origin systems that need maintenance and parts. He cited examples: when Ecuador considered sending old Russian-made equipment to Ukraine in exchange for U.S. military aid, Russia threatened to block Ecuadorian banana exports — nearly $1 billion annually — by imposing new phytosanitary checks. Similarly, Moscow has kept Brazil and Argentina largely muted on the Ukraine invasion by leveraging its control over nitrate fertilizer exports, crucial to both agricultural giants. Russia also continues to service aging equipment across the region. "They sell a lot of kit here," Berg added. "Many countries still operate Russian-origin systems that need maintenance and parts. "The Russians are pretty tied down in Ukraine," Berg said. "We saw during the 12-day war, when Iran appealed for help, Moscow stayed silent. "He essentially said, ‘We have no mutual-defense treaty,'" Berg noted. "That was widely read as: we're not coming to Venezuela." President Donald Trump has reportedly approved CIA covert measures inside Venezuela — operations that often precede military force — and U.S. planners have already drawn up target lists for cartel sites, according to the New York Times. "I don't see any immediate connection," Hardie said. "Russia's ability to influence events in Venezuela is pretty limited." He said Moscow's power-projection capacity in the Western Hemisphere remains constrained. "They can take limited action — fly some bombers into the region, sail submarines to Cuba — but major operations in Latin America are beyond their capacity," Hardie said. Hardie also noted reports of the Russian Ilyushin transport aircraft visiting Venezuela and suggestions it could have carried air-defense systems, but said any such transfer would have little strategic effect. "Even if Russia slipped in some air defenses, it wouldn't make much difference," he said. Both Krummrich and Berg agree that momentum is building toward U.S. kinetic action. "Maduro's instinct is to buy time — that's what's kept him afloat through multiple administrations," Berg said. "But Trump wants results, not a two-year transition or vague promises about U.S. oil access. The question is what Maduro can offer that will actually satisfy him." Whether this two-track moment represents coincidence or coordination, the stakes are high. A peace framework in Europe could stabilize one front while a new flashpoint ignites closer to home — underscoring the paradox of Washington's posture in late 2025: seeking de-escalation abroad while bracing for confrontation in its own hemisphere.

By 



In an unusual diplomatic move, Chinese leader Xi Jinping initiated a phone call with President Trump on Monday to discuss Taiwan, a flashpoint that has surged to the forefront in recent days as Japan takes a more assertive stance on the island's autonomy.

While Taiwan was Xi's focus, Trump steered the conversation to Ukraine, said people familiar with the matter, as Washington-Kyiv peace talks appear to make progress and Trump tries to decisively end Russia's war in Ukraine.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Those chips do all the fancy, complicated math needed to display images, videos, and 3D graphics onto our screens. Back in the day, if you wanted to play “state-of-the-art” PC games like Unreal, Quake, or Half-Life, you likely bought one of Nvidia's GPUs (more commonly called graphics cards at the time). “If you were a really serious gamer back in like 1998, you would be building your own high powered PC at home. You'd be up to your ears in circuit boards and soldering equipment,” Robbie Wheland, a tech and business reporter for The Wall Street Journal told Today, Explained co-host Noel King. “And you'd be buying one of Nvidia's graphics cards, and putting that into your awesome high powered gaming computer that you would play on the internet.” The company, and its founder Jensen Huang, have also become powerful players within American politics, foreign relations, and international diplomacy. Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify. Tell me about Jensen Huang, the man behind Nvidia. Jensen Huang is the co-founder and chief executive of Nvidia. Today, he's not only just the CEO of the largest company on Planet Earth, he's also an incredibly influential and powerful person in foreign relations, in international diplomacy. He's a very good friend of President Donald Trump. And I think it's not a stretch to say he's one of the most important individual people on Earth right now, just given how much power and how much economic might he oversees. If you go back to Trump's inauguration, and you think about who was with him that day, many of them were tech CEOs, but Jensen Huang was not among them. My understanding is that Donald Trump maybe didn't even know who Jensen was in January. But when it came to his style of management; his style of deal making; and, more importantly, what Jensen could do for President Trump in terms of helping him negotiate international accords, he's now become a show pony that Trump brings around to world leaders. He says this is really an example of American ingenuity and innovation. But, I don't think any of that existed when Trump took office in January. Tell me about how this relationship develops, then, and evolves. What they did was they took certain products, certain classes of products, which generally meant very powerful microchips and said, “You can't sell these overseas to certain companies.” At the time, the AI race was just really heating up. But Nvidia was not allowed to sell its chips in China, in particular, because there were serious national security concerns and serious concerns about competition and not letting China catch up with us. Fast forward to this year, and Donald Trump is back in the White House for a second term, and Jensen Huang obviously needed to revisit this issue. There were a number of influential people in the Trump National Security Council who successfully made the argument that it's a bad idea for us to be selling our most advanced technology to the Chinese. And, in that context, Jensen Huang starts building a friendship with Donald Trump because it was gonna be very important for him to be on friendly terms with a president, given how this war of ideas was shaking out. In August of this year, he goes to Trump. This is a huge win for Jensen Huang. It has security concerns.” So, Nvidia starts developing a new chip for China. This proves to be too much for people in Washington who are concerned about national security, concerned about competition with China. And they've actually decided, unbeknownst to Jensen Huang, that they're not gonna approve high-quality chips to be sold in China. What has been going on with these two guys behind the scenes? There's a lot of speculation about whether this is another Elon Musk-type situation. President Trump always likes to have a tech billionaire who he can consult with and bounce ideas off of. One thing to know about Donald Trump, and I know this because I've spoken to him about it directly, is that he really likes people when they're successful. He likes that successful people are on his team. When it dawned on Trump that this guy, Jensen Huang, was just a really successful, brilliant executive, and he was building something really special and big and powerful in Nvidia, Trump really seized on that. Trump will call Jensen Huang late at night, pick his brain about things. Jensen's a frequent visitor to the White House, which is something that he'd never done before this year, really. But, in the last month, he has backed off of his seemingly unshakable commitment to let Nvidia sell its products in China. I think that Jenssen's been very good at managing the relationship, and he's pledging his support to the most powerful president on Planet Earth using the language that that president loves to hear. Does Jensen Huang want to work in government like Musk did, or does the guy just want to sell his chips in China and do what's best for his business? I think that Jensen Huang has been thrust into this sort of role as an international diplomat, and as a lobbyist, and all these different roles that he's had to play.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has leaned into his clemency powers during his second term, dishing out pardons to more than 1,000 January 6 US Capitol rioters, former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, baseball legend Darryl Strawberry, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani — and now: Gobble and Waddle. Justice will be served at the White House on Tuesday as Trump pardons a pair of turkeys for fowl reasons, participating in the 78th annual National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation. The president will make much ado about stuffing and appeal to his baste at the Thanksgiving roast, a yearly opportunity for a cornucopia of puns and a moment to give thanks — providing some levity amid a range of global crises and plenty of political upheaval. Unlike previous years, just one turkey will take part in the ceremonial pardon, injecting little suspense into the process. First lady Melania Trump's office invited the American people to vote for which turkey would participate by texting “Gobble” or “Waddle” to 45470. They spent their young lives training for their pardon, getting acclimated to loud sounds, big crowds and bright lights ahead of a luxe stay in a suite at the nearby Willard InterContinental Hotel. Following Tuesday's festivities, the birds will retreat to North Carolina State University's Prestage Department of Poultry Science in Raleigh to live out a relieved retirement. White House holiday festivities get underway despite ballroom construction Folklore has it that Lincoln's young son asked his father to spare a pet turkey that was supposed to be part of their Thanksgiving dinner. While Truman was the first to accept a turkey from the group, he did not offer it a pardon. The first documented turkey pardon was given by John F. Kennedy in 1963, though it didn't catch on right away. Even though Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon, neither decided to pardon any turkeys as president. Turkey pardoning became the norm in 1989, when George H.W. This will mark Trump's fifth turkey pardon, and, like his recent predecessors, he has peppered the event with topical political jokes. Trump poked fun at the impeachment inquiry against him in 2019, telling a crowd that the turkeys “have already received subpoenas to appear in Adam Schiff's basement,” referring to the California Democrat, then a congressman. Former President Joe Biden nodded to the 2022 midterm election dynamics when he pardoned Chocolate and Chip: “The votes are in, they've been counted and verified, no ballot stuffing, no fowl play. The only red wave this season is going to be if German shepherd Commander knocks over the cranberry sauce.” And Barack Obama employed his signature rhetoric in 2016: “I want to take a moment to recognize the great turkeys who weren't so lucky, who didn't get to ride the gravy train to freedom.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After more than a century of munching on her favorite foods of romaine lettuce and cactus fruit, beloved Galápagos tortoise Gramma, the oldest resident of the San Diego Zoo, has died. Gramma was born in her native habitat and was estimated to be about 141 years old, zoo officials said. It's not clear exactly when the tortoise arrived at the San Diego Zoo, but zoo officials said she came from the Bronx Zoo in either 1928 or 1931 as part of their first group of Galápagos tortoises. She lived through two World Wars and 20 US presidents. Her care specialists affectionately called her “the Queen of the Zoo.” She was suffering from bone conditions related to her old age that progressed recently before she was euthanized, the zoo said. Many visitors commented on social media about getting to first visit Gramma when they were young, and being able to come back years later with their kids. Galapagos tortoise species was thought to be extinct until a female loner's discovery Cristina Park, 69, said one of her earliest memories from her childhood was going to the San Diego Zoo when she was 3 or 4 years old and riding on the back of a tortoise. That's no longer allowed, but the experience inspired her to keep a small desert tortoise as a pet and learn more about tortoise conservation. “Just how amazing it is that they managed to live through so much,” Park said. Galapagos tortoises can live for over 100 years in the wild, and close to double that in captivity. The rest are all vulnerable or critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Concerted efforts have been made to breed these tortoises in captivity over the past several decades, with more than 10,000 juveniles released to the wild since 1965, according to the Galápagos Conservancy. Some subspecies have been brought back from the brink of extinction. In April, four baby Galápagos tortoises were born at the Philadelphia Zoo to first-time parents that were roughly 100 years old, a first in the zoo's history. In June, Zoo Miami resident and Galápagos tortoise Goliath became a first-time father at the age of 135.</p>

SEOUL—As China and the U.S. race to dominate artificial intelligence, countries are increasingly wary of becoming overly dependent on the superpowers for a technology that could profoundly affect their economic competitiveness and national security.

In response, a select few are seeking to build out their own AI capabilities and become leaders alongside the U.S. and China.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pleaded with the public on Monday to act and dress with respect as they travel this holiday season, citing recent trends of unruly behavior in U.S. airports. The Department of Transportation unveiled a “civility campaign” last week, encouraging people to travel with respect and courtesy toward others due to increasing numbers of in-flight outbursts and unruly passenger incidents. Duffy echoed this message on Monday, encouraging travelers to both act and dress appropriately as they travel to crowded airports, highways, and railroads during the busy travel season ahead of Thanksgiving. Duffy called on travelers to “think about those who are around us” and “call on our better angels” instead of giving in to travel frustrations. Let's try not to wear slippers in and pajamas as we come to the airport.” In addition to requesting that travelers leave their sweat sets behind, he also asked fliers to help others load their bags into the overhead storage bins. “Common courtesy and civility, I think, is going to work well. They're working their hearts out to make sure that this is the best experience possible for you and the safest experience possible for you. But if you are delayed or canceled, know that it comes from a place of your safety and mine,” Duffy said. “If it's weather, if it's mechanical, if it's air traffic control, staffing issues, those are the factors that are considered as those decisions are being made.”</p>
