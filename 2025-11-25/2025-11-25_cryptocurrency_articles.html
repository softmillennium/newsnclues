                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If these doldrums give way to outflows, there could be a real problem. Stablecoins are the crypto sector's cash equivalent asset of choice. Typically backed by fiat currency accounts and supported by smart contracts that maintain the coin's price stability, these coins serve specialized purposes in the cryptocurrency world. For most investors, they serve as the bridge between bank accounts and blockchains. A market that was gushing new on-chain dollars is suddenly just idling, and that could be a problem for Ethereum (ETH 2.67%), as more than half of those stablecoins live on that blockchain. Let's unpack how serious this trend losing steam might be, and what investors should do about it. In Q3 2025 alone, the total stablecoin value across all blockchains surged by more than $44 billion. But in late November, the combined market cap of all stablecoins appears to be going into reverse after a multiyear spree of robust expansion. In other words, the stream of new dollar equivalents flowing into crypto has gone from a gush to a trickle, at least for now; it's presently unclear precisely what is driving the sharp falloff, but it could be as simple as elevated macroeconomic uncertainty. Ethereum and its massive DeFi ecosystem are uniquely exposed to stablecoin flows, as it's the crypto sector's single largest venue for those assets to generate a yield or be exchanged for any one of a plethora of other assets on the network. It currently has roughly $165 billion worth of stablecoin tokens circulating on its chain, down 1.6% in the last 30 days. That stablecoin value is a big part of the reason why Ethereum's DeFi total value locked (TVL) is $68.9 billion, the largest in all of crypto. Ideally, rising stablecoin balances on Ethereum would keep attracting new users, developers of decentralized applications (dApps), and fees. For Ethereum, the risk scenario is that if the total stablecoin market cap stagnates or shrinks for a year or two, fewer new dollars will arrive on the chain. Its DeFi platforms might see slower growth in collateral and activity. And less Ether would be burned or otherwise expended via gas fees. In a nutshell, it would mean the part of its investment thesis that assumes a constantly expanding pool of on-chain cash would (perhaps only temporarily) weaken, even as the core technology continues to improve. Furthermore, tokenized U.S. Treasury products are gaining traction, which is important because they're another type of cash equivalent. If stablecoin value stops rising but on-chain Treasury bill value accelerates, the combined movements could ultimately continue the trend of more dollar-backed assets entering Ethereum (net of outflows). In turn, that bullish effect should prevent Ethereum's price from falling much (or at all). Thus, the base case here is that stablecoin growth resumes (and Treasury growth accelerates) once the broader crypto market digests its recent volatility. So, it's pretty clear that declining stablecoin value is a yellow flag, even if it isn't a reason to rush to sell Ethereum. If, over the next two to six months, stablecoin market cap resumes a clear uptrend and Ethereum maintains or expands its dominance, the current outflows will be forgotten as a tiny blip, and today's worries will have aged poorly. If, instead, the sector grinds sideways while Ethereum cedes its share to faster or more specialized competitors, that would be a genuine signal to revisit the coin's investment thesis and perhaps reallocate your capital. Until then, keep an eye on the stablecoin market, as it's a big predictor of where the on-chain action is going to be -- assuming it's going to happen at all, that is.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here are the major liquidation clusters on perpetuals protocol Hyperliquid where leverage may unwind. “Market buy and sell orders triggered by liquidations can cause rapid price movements, leading to a ‘cascading effect' where more nearby positions get liquidated,” Coinglass explains. As data on these liquidation levels from centralized exchanges like Coinbase is not public, we'll focus on data from crypto perpetuals protocol Hyperliquid, which is all on-chain and therefore transparent. There is a lot of money riding on different positions in bitcoin. $63,875: 668.29 BTC positions or $58 million will be liquidated at the specific price. $73,557: 537.83 BTC positions or $46.7 million will be liquidated at the specific price. $78,617: 621.21 BTC positions or $54 million will be liquidated at the specific price. “For the downside: we see a large build up of puts on the $80/$75K strikes for the 5 DEC expiry, so it checks out traders are buying insurance if BTC breaks through this support,” according to Sean Dawson, core contributor and head of research at on-chain trading platform Derive. $94,354: 747.05 BTC positions or $64.9 million will be liquidated at the specific price. “We have moderate build up of calls on the $90K, but far larger spikes at $100/$110K strikes,” Dawson told Sherwood News. “If BTC rallies, traders are betting we hit the 6+ figure and probably surpass it.” $95,123: 1,140 BTC positions or $99 million will be liquidated at the specific price. $98,356: 495 BTC positions or $43 million will be liquidated at the specific price. $112,005: 595.68 BTC positions or $51.7 million will be liquidated at the specific price. $114,295: 455.08 BTC positions or $39.5 million will be liquidated at the specific price. A drop to $2,327 would liquidate 15,000 ethereum tokens' worth of positions, or $43.5 million, on Hyperliquid. In total, the full move down to $2,327 would wipe out 113,180 ethereum tokens' worth of leveraged long positions, or $328.7 million, data from the crypto derivative platform Coinglass shows. Nicolai Søndergaard, research analyst at blockchain analytics firm Nansen, echoed a similar sentiment. “For ETH, key levels from consensus seem to be around $2.4K-2.5K range as a bottom,” he told Sherwood. “These numbers also coincide with where puts seem mostly concentrated.” These price levels matter beyond Hyperliquid, because they act as a proxy for leverage across other centralized exchanges, which don't have publicly available data. Stress on one trading platform, whether on-chain or off-chain, can spill into the broader ecosystem. When price fluctuations trigger large scale liquidations on any venue, the forced buying and selling can spread into spot markets and become a market-wide swing, as shown during October's wipeout. Investors have pulled over $2.3 billion (net) throughout November so far. With their soaring popularity redefining and legitimizing cryptocurrencies at an institutional level, spot bitcoin ETFs have become a key barometer of wider investor sentiment surrounding the digital currency — as well as risk assets more broadly. Notably, spot bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust tend to see their inflows accelerate with rising prices, and amplify falling prices when outflows become dominant. Citi Research, cited by Bloomberg, found that this feedback loop sees a ~3.4% price drop for every $1 billion pulled out from bitcoin ETFs. Related reading: Bitcoin's plunge produces technical signal that implies 60% more downside to come Bitcoin ETFs have seen $1.45 billion leave the funds this week so far. The price of solana is trading around $140, more than 50% away from its all-time high set in January.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cryptocurrency staking means locking up your coins to help run a blockchain and earn rewards. As Reuters explains, staking lets holders validate transactions on a proof-of-stake network and earn transaction fees or newly minted coins in return. From the user's perspective, staking is essentially “locking up” tokens to earn returns. In this guide, we'll explain how staking works! Staking is the backbone of many modern cryptocurrencies. On networks like Ethereum, validators run nodes that confirm transactions. To be eligible, validators must stake (lock) coins as collateral. Unlike proof-of-work mining (which uses huge amounts of electricity), proof-of-stake networks are far more energy-efficient. The rewards for staking is a hot Reddit topic. Generally, newer or smaller networks pay higher APYs to attract validators (sometimes 10-20% or more), while very large networks pay lower rates. By contrast, some smaller networks like certain DeFi tokens or new blockchains might promise 10%+ APY to bootstrap security. Compared to traditional finance, even a 3-5% yield is huge. For context, average U.S. savings accounts yield only about 0.40% APY today. In other words, staking doesn't eliminate risk – it adds smart passive income potential on top of existing crypto risk. Leonardo da Vinci famously said: “Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do.” The previous section speaks on how staking rewards works. Here are some of the top cryptocurrencies with a staking mechanisms: Stay informed about any legal developments in your country concerning cryptocurrencies and staking. Besides staking, you could earn stocks, bonds, or rent real estate. In some countries, including New Zealand, users interested in digital assets often explore additional forms of entertainment and financial instruments that combine cryptocurrencies and analytics. This can be useful for those who want to understand how such services work and what conditions they offer before making a choice. In the end, staking can be a smart, hands-off way to grow your crypto holdings. This guide has put you on the right track.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Klarna launches its first stablecoin, KlarnaUSD, built on Stripe's Tempo blockchain as the company enters crypto and targets cheaper global payments. Global digital bank and flexible payments provider Klarna has announced the launch of its first stablecoin, KlarnaUSD. Klarna is now the first bank to issue a stablecoin on the new Tempo blockchain, a payments-focused network created by Stripe and Paradigm. The announcement comes as stablecoin usage continues to surge. McKinsey estimates that annual stablecoin transaction volume already exceeds $27 trillion and could surpass traditional payment systems by the end of the decade. In October 2025, total stablecoin market capitalization crossed $300 billion for the first time. Analysts estimate that cross-border payments alone generate around $120 billion in annual fees. Klarna believes stablecoins can dramatically reduce these costs for both consumers and businesses. Siemiatkowski emphasized that Klarna's global scale and Tempo's infrastructure give the company a unique opportunity to challenge legacy systems.He stated:“With 114 million customers and $112 billion in annual GMV, Klarna has the scale to change payments globally. This is the beginning of Klarna's foray into crypto, and I'm excited to partner with Stripe and Tempo to help shape the future of payments.” KlarnaUSD is currently running on a testnet and is not available for public use, allowing the company to conduct extensive testing ahead of its planned Tempo mainnet launch in 2026. The broader payments industry is rapidly adapting as well. Visa recently expanded support for stablecoins across four networks, while Western Union is testing its own stablecoin technology and plans to launch a branded stablecoin in the first half of 2026.</p>

Earn rewards worth up to 5,000 USDT on your first deposit New CryptoQuant data  shows Bitcoin's Sharpe Ratio, a widely used gauge of risk-adjusted returns, has slipped back toward zero in recent days. Analysts said the readings typically reflect periods of elevated uncertainty and weak return quality, often occurring during times of strong volatility. CryptoQuant noted that similar collapses in 2019, 2020, and 2022 preceded extended phases of risk repricing. While the move does not signal a definitive bottom, analysts say compressed Sharpe levels tend to mark the early stages of improving forward returns, provided that price conditions stabilize. CryptoQuant's analyst noted that “until the Sharpe Ratio starts turning upward, short-term noise can remain dominant, and positioning should be sized accordingly.” The ratio's decline comes as fresh blockchain data suggests modest re-accumulation among some larger Bitcoin investors. According to Santiment , the number of wallets holding at least 100 BTC has risen 0.47% since Nov. 11, adding 91 new mid-sized whale addresses. CCN analyst Valdrin Tahiri said Bitcoin's long-term Elliott Wave structure points to a potentially extended correction phase after completing a multi-year advance. According to Tahiri, Bitcoin has posted a clear five-wave upward movement since November 2022. “Bitcoin has completed the fifth and final wave of its upward movement and is now correcting inside wave A of its A-B-C correction,” he wrote. He noted that wave A is still developing and could push Bitcoin lower toward the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement support near $71,000.</p>

KuCoin secured registration with AUSTRAC, Australia's financial intelligence and regulatory agency, through its own Australian subsidiary, enabling the platform to legally operate digital currency exchange services in the country.

The registration allows KuCoin to introduce fiat on-ramps and expand crypto services for Australian users under local regulatory oversight.

Australia mandates AUSTRAC registration for digital currency exchanges to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. The regulatory framework requires offshore crypto platforms to align with existing financial services regulations.

In addition to AUSTRAC registration, KuCoin has partnered with Echuca Trading, an AFSL-licensed financial services provider, to bring its crypto futures business under a regulated structure tailored to the Australian market.

These steps enhance accessibility for Australian users while maintaining compliance with local regulatory requirements.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altcoin ETFs Including XRP, Solana in Green Amid Crypto Market Uncertainty U.S. spot altcoin exchange-traded funds posted daily inflows Monday, amid a broader crypto market selloff that has pushed overall sentiment into fearful territory. This sustained demand stems from risk-management-based capital rotation and improved regulatory clarity, experts told Decrypt. It suggests many investors are holding for the long term, treating the current selloff as an opportunity rather than a signal to exit, Lin explained. While Solana and XRP ETF products saw sustained daily inflows, CoinShares' weekly report highlights a key difference between the two. “In the current risk-off environment, assets with clearer, less speculative narratives tend to hold up better,” Rachel Lin, CEO and Co-Founder of SynFutures, told Decrypt. “Investors are likely reallocating rather than simply abandoning crypto entirely.” The success of these products is building a new pipeline for institutional capital. Risk-on sentiment has improved, extending Bitcoin's weekend bounce into the week, per a previous Decrypt report. Sentiment around the prospects of a rate cut is reflected in prediction market Myriad, owned by Decrypt's parent company Dastan, where users assign an 82% chance that the Fed would cut rates by a quarter point on December 10. “With the increasing odds of a December rate cut, there is potential for liquidity to flow back into risk assets, including altcoins,” said Rachel Lin. However, she tempered expectations, noting that any rally would be selective. “I would expect this rally, if it happens, to be selective rather than broad-based,” Lin noted. “Altcoins with strong structural stories and institutional access have a good chance of outperforming into December, but it's not a guarantee of an across-the-board altseason.” XRP is up 7.1% over the past 24 hours while Solana's performance hovers slightly lower, around 5.2%, according to CoinGecko data.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a brief five-day rally, Bitcoin once again continued its downward plunge, losing another 1% between 7 p.m. In large part, that reflected a general risk-off attitude across global markets this morning. S&P 500 futures were down 0.19% after the index closed up 1.55% yesterday. Asia was mixed this morning, and Europe followed by moving flat-to-down in early trading. Crypto may be suffering from a significant shift in sentiment: Until Oct. 6 this year, Bitcoin and gold had moved up together, though certainly not in tandem. However, both rose on a “safe haven” narrative as stocks soared, despite worries that the tech companies driving them are fueling an AI bubble. When the U.S. government shut down, both gold and Bitcoin hit record highs. Deutsche Bank analysts even argued that Bitcoin would soon be bought by global central banks as a new reserve asset on their balance sheets (even though crypto is “backed by nothing,” they said). A month on, the “Bitcoin is digital gold” and thus a “store of value” argument is seemingly in tatters, as Bitcoin and gold have diverged. Gold is moving toward a new record high while “the crypto market's total capitalization has now fallen by about 24% (over $1 trillion) since its October peak,” according to a note by Deutsche Bank's Marion Laboure and Camilla Siazon shared yesterday. “Gold has just delivered its most extraordinary year in more than four decades. Prices surged more than 50% in 2025 so far, making it the metal's best performance since 1979,” according to ActivTrades analyst Carolane de Palmas. When traditional finance platforms launched Bitcoin ETFs, there was a huge influx of interest, as retail investors (who previously may not have felt confident enough to create a crypto wallet) decided to enter the market. “Every $1 billion that leaves a Bitcoin ETF pulls down the price of Bitcoin by 3.4%,” according to Alex Saunders at Citi Research. The second major factor pushing up gold is, ironically, crypto. Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has become a buyer of gold on a scale comparable to central banks. Tether maintains USDT on a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar by backing each coin with the dollar equivalent in cash, bonds or—more recently—gold bullion. Thus begins a spiral that widens the divergence between gold and Bitcoin over time. Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Banks in India are already under pressure to become more innovative, understand the needs of digital-first customers, and conduct large-scale financial transactions in a secure manner. With CBDCs and cryptocurrencies continuing to attract this much attention, their impact on the sector cannot be ignored. Hence, for understanding the impact thereof, a distinction between CBDC and cryptocurrency is necessary. For instance, a CBDC, which in this context can be said to be India's Digital Rupee, is basically a fiat currency in digital form but has been issued and is being governed by the RBI. It actually enjoys the same value, trust, and regulatory support as hard cash. Their value fluctuates according to market demand, global adoption, and investor interest. Digital Rupee may allow individuals and companies to hold the currency directly with the RBI, using digital wallets, thereby being less dependent on commercial banks for such services. Digital currency could minimize the expense of cash handling, improve transparency, and promote interbank settlements. The CBDC would, however, decrease customer deposits in cases where users decide it is preferable to hold CBDCs instead of continuing to hold money in bank accounts. Cryptocurrencies are known for their decentralized control, efficiency in cross-border transactions, and investment opportunities. Banks are limited, however, by the need to consider compliance requirements and regulatory uncertainty. In these cases, monitoring the flows, combating financial crimes, and consumer protection are much more difficult. There is also a greater risk of cybersecurity for banks, as crypto-transactions cannot be undone. However, the rise of crypto forced Indian banks to consider blockchain applications, digital asset custody, tokenized financial products, and faster rails for making payments. The comparison of CBDC vs Cryptocurrency in India further outlines how banks must evolve to meet customer expectations of faster and safer experiences in more digitally enabled ways. Also, CBDCs may allow the RBI to implement monetary policy more efficiently with real-time visibility over money flows. With CBDCs, transactions for customers would be safer, more transparent, and cheaper. Conversely, cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile in value, hence not serving any beneficial purpose for ordinary day-to-day transactions. Whereas both CBDCs and cryptocurrencies have impacts on how payments are transacted, they do so in very different ways. On one hand, CBDCs could find a home in the current payments infrastructure, possibly enabling real-time bank-to-bank transfers and making the need for an intermediary less relevant. For instance, wallet integration, settlement interfaces, and customer authentication could be features that CBDCs might possess. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies force banks to rethink security, compliance, and risk management. Financial institutions that cannot adapt to these changes run the risk of losing relevance in a world just starting to move toward digital-first finance. The aspect of CBDC versus cryptocurrency in India provides a pointer toward how the future of banking will blend regulated digital currency with decentralized innovation. If CBDCs offer stability, then cryptocurrencies draw in those investors looking for growth and financial freedom. CBDCs will never fully replace cryptocurrencies because they serve different purposes, but easy-to-use CBDC wallets and government-backed security might cut down on small-scale crypto adoption. If India launches a full-scale Digital Rupee, then some users will definitely abandon cryptocurrencies to meet their everyday payment needs. This ongoing debate on CBDC vs. Cryptocurrency in India has been actively molding investor behavior and regulatory frameworks. CBDCs have the potential to strengthen financial infrastructure, modernize payments, and bring greater monetary control. While there is regulation on the use of cryptocurrencies, they indeed encourage technological evolution and open new opportunities for asset diversification. All this will involve collaboration by regulators, banks, and fintech innovators. As India navigates the broader discussion of CBDC vs Cryptocurrency in India, the eventual outcome will depend upon how effectively banks balance innovation with stability and customer trust. Digital Rupee can ease ways of paying and settling, but it could mean a reduction in bank deposits if people start holding CBDC wallets instead of regular accounts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TrustLinq enables cryptocurrency spending for individuals and businesses by facilitating direct crypto-to-fiat payments without a bank account. TrustLinq, a Swiss-regulated crypto-to-fiat payment intermediary, announced the launch of its pioneering crypto-to-fiat payment platform that enables cryptocurrency holders to send fiat payments directly from crypto holdings to anyone, anywhere in the world in over 70 local currencies. The platform, underpinned by Swiss oversight, bank-level compliance and secure automation enables direct crypto-to-fiat seamlessly and executes payments via local payment rails — or through TrustLinq debit cards (debit cards Q1 2026). The platform addresses a critical market inefficiency: while over 580 million cryptocurrency users exist globally, less than 0.005% of businesses accept digital assets directly. This creates friction for crypto holders seeking to deploy digital assets for real-world expenses such as rent, payroll, supplier payments, and operational costs. TrustLinq eliminates this friction by enabling direct crypto-to-fiat payments without requiring recipients to accept crypto, open a wallet, or change their banking setup. TrustLinq is an early-mover in the emerging niche of crypto-to-fiat payment facilitation, with no direct competitors offering comparable functionality. The platform serves two primary market segments with tailored solutions. For individuals, TrustLinq enables cryptocurrency holders to pay personal expenses such as rent, tuition, leisure and international transfers directly from crypto holdings. The solution particularly resonates with trading firms, affiliate networks, SaaS companies, and e-commerce businesses that receive cryptocurrency as operational revenue. With 580m+ crypto users globally holding substantial digital assets, the demand for practical, compliant fiat utility is immense. The roadmap underscores the company's commitment to transitioning cryptocurrency from a speculative asset class into a practical financial instrument for daily operations and personal expenses. TrustLinq is a Swiss-regulated financial intermediary bridging cryptocurrency and traditional banking. The company prioritizes security, compliance, and user control through a non-custodial intermediary model that does not hold client funds.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is struggling to gain momentum as it heads toward its worst month since June 2022. As prices hover above $88,000 per token, or roughly 30% off their October all-time highs of more than $126,000, the cryptocurrency's problems don't appear to be easing. First, outflows of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for November have reached $3.5 billion, their largest since February. "These ETFs have turned into sellers, and as long as they keep selling, I think the markets will struggle to stay up, or rebound," he said. According to the firm's data, roughly $800 million flowed out of crypto and back into fiat currencies last week. Instead, its price is pegged to other assets, most commonly the US dollar. That happened in the days after crypto's historic wipeout last month. "Money is not just failing to come in, it's actually leaving the crypto market," Thielen said. Recent dovish comments hinting at a Federal Reserve rate cut in December helped lift bitcoin and other assets on Monday. Even if the Fed cuts in December, it is likely to be a hawkish cut, meaning this rally should be viewed as a short-term, oversold reaction amid extreme fear rather than the start of a sustainable V-shaped recovery. Bitcoin has struggled to recover since the leveraged liquidation event on Oct. 10 wiped out $19 billion in a single day. Bitcoin's past performance from peak to trough has largely followed an every-four-year supply cut known as "the halving." Many investors now deny that the same trajectory will repeat. "There has been OG people selling every single cycle," said Nicolai Søndergaard, a research analyst for blockchain analytics firm Nansen. The sell-off has rippled across nearly every corner of the digital asset space, with total crypto market capitalization falling more than 30%, from $4.28 trillion on Oct. 6 to $2.99 trillion as of Monday. Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also tumbled 38% since early October, while Solana (SOL-USD) dropped more than 40% during the same period. Strategy (MSTR) and the wave of public companies that have imitated its playbook of adding bitcoin and other digital assets to their corporate balance sheets has significantly cooled. While Strategy is still in the green, many of these other so-called digital asset treasuries (DATs) are now underwater on their crypto positions. Meanwhile, bitcoin miners like IREN (IREN), Riot (RIOT), and Mara Holdings (MARA) have retraced more than 30% to the downside, despite their pivots toward servicing the AI sector.
