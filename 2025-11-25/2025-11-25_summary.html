I have been called to testify at courts-martial as an expert witness on servicemembers' duty to disobey unlawful orders.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

The courageous action of six Democratic members of Congress has thrust into the national discourse the duty of military and CIA personnel to disobey Donald Trump's illegal orders. As the Trump administration continues to unlawfully murder people in small vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, deploy the National Guard to U.S. cities, and ignore court orders, the six lawmakers were moved to act.

In a 90-second video organized by Sen. Elissa Slotkin (Michigan), two senators and four Congress members, all U.S. military or CIA veterans, take turns reading a statement to active servicemembers, urging them to refuse to follow illegal orders.

“Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution,” the lawmakers said in the video. “Right now, the threats to our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad, but from right here at home. Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders. You can refuse illegal orders. You must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.”

The other lawmakers speaking in the video are Sen. Mark Kelly (Arizona) and Representatives Chris Deluzio (Pennsylvania), Maggie Goodlander (New Hampshire), Chrissy Houlahan (Pennsylvania), and Jason Crow (Colorado).

Trump Threatens Six Lawmakers With Sedition Charges and Hanging

Their words, which constituted a correct statement of the law, elicited unprecedented vitriol from Trump, who wrote on Truth Social: “It's called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL.”

“Right now, the threats to our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad, but from right here at home … You must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.”

In a second post, Trump wrote: “This is really bad, and Dangerous to our Country. Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP??? President DJT.” And he added in a third post: “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump also reposted a statement saying: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”

The six lawmakers responded to Trump's diatribe in a statement: “What's most telling is that the president considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law. Our servicemembers should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. It is not only the right thing to do, but also our duty.”

Now the Department of War is investigating Kelly for “serious allegations of misconduct,” threatening to call him back to active duty and court-martial him. The Department's “Official Statement” posted on X adds, “All servicemembers are reminded that they have a legal obligation under the UCMJ to obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful.” But they fail to add that servicemembers also have a legal duty to disobey unlawful orders, which is what Kelly and his fellow lawmakers accurately stated in their video.

The Duty to Disobey Unlawful Orders

Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), a servicemember can be punished by court-martial for refusing to obey any lawful order or regulation. Although the UCMJ doesn't define “lawful,” the Manual for Courts-Martial states that an order is lawful “unless it is contrary to the Constitution, the laws of the United States, or lawful superior orders or for some other reason is beyond the authority of the official issuing it.”

The manual also says that although it may be inferred that an order to perform a military duty or act is lawful, “this inference does not apply to a patently illegal order, such as one that directs the commission of a crime.” The Rules for Courts-Martial say that acting “pursuant to orders” is a legitimate defense “unless the accused knew the orders to be unlawful or a person of ordinary sense and understanding would have known the orders to be unlawful.”

Finally, the manual notes, “The lawfulness of an order is a question of law to be determined by the military judge.” Normally, that determination can be made only after a servicemember refuses or disobeys an order, in a court martial or war crimes tribunal. So the refuser takes the risk that a judge will find the order lawful and he or she will be punished for refusing to follow it.

Examples of unlawful orders within the United States include:

Examples of unlawful orders outside the United States include:

Resistance to Illegal U.S. Wars — From Vietnam to Iraq

In 1968, U.S. Army Lt. William Calley led 100 U.S. troops into the village of My Lai in Vietnam and killed 500 civilian women, children, and elderly men in what came to be known as the My Lai Massacre.

“Servicemembers should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders.”

Calley was accused of the premeditated murder of civilians. Charges were filed against 25 people, including two generals. The charges against the generals, 10 other officers, and seven enlisted men were dismissed. Five others, including the company commander, Capt. Ernest Medina, were court-martialed and acquitted.

At his court-martial, Calley claimed that he was just following Medina's orders to kill all the villagers because everyone in the village was “the enemy.”

Like the Nazi officials at Nuremberg, Calley's defense that he was just following superior orders was rejected. In 1971, he was convicted of the premeditated murder of “not less than” 22 Vietnamese people and sentenced to life in prison. Ultimately, Calley only served over three years of house arrest and confinement to barracks.

But there is a noble tradition in the United States of servicemembers refusing orders to deploy to illegal wars and/or commit war crimes. Some refusers have been arrested and court-martialed. Many have argued in their defense that they had a legal duty to disobey illegal orders.

Howard Levy

In 1965, Dr. Howard Levy was a captain in the Army and chief of Dermatological Service of the U.S. Army Hospital at Ft. Jackson in South Carolina. Levy thought that Black soldiers were being used as cannon fodder for the illegal Vietnam War.

Levy disobeyed an order to train Special Forces aidmen to be paramedics. He felt they would use their medical training to gain the trust of the Vietnamese people who would then not oppose U.S. troops carrying out their illegal missions. Levy, who called this the “prostitution of medicine,” thought these Green Berets were committing war crimes.

In 1967, Levy was charged by court-martial with willfully disobeying a lawful command by his superior officer, conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, and publicly uttering statements to enlisted personnel with design to promote disloyalty and disaffection among the troops.

Levy tried to argue that the war was illegal and immoral and that U.S. troops were committing war crimes. But the judge didn't allow him to raise that defense, and Levy was convicted of all charges and sentenced to dismissal from the Army, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and three years confinement at hard labor. 

Ehren Watada

Resistance to George W. Bush's illegal Afghanistan and Iraq Wars was also widespread. Many resisters were inspired by their predecessors who had resisted the Vietnam War.

When U.S. Army First Lieutenant Ehren Watada, the first commissioned officer to publicly disobey an order to deploy to Iraq, addressed the 2007 Veterans For Peace convention, he invoked the GI Movement that helped end the Vietnam War. He said:

I speak with you about a radical idea. It is one born from the very concept of the American soldier (or service member). It became instrumental in ending the Vietnam War — but it has been long since forgotten. The idea is this: that to stop an illegal and unjust war, the soldiers can choose to stop fighting it.

In 2006, the Army had charged Watada with missing movement and conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. He stated at a press conference in Tacoma, Washington: “The war in Iraq is in fact illegal. It is my obligation and my duty to refuse any orders to participate in this war. An order to take part in an illegal war is unlawful in itself. So my obligation is not to follow the order to go to Iraq.” Citing “deception and manipulation and willful misconduct by the highest levels of my chain of command,” he declared that there is “no greater betrayal to the American people” than the Iraq War.

The “turning point” for Watada was when he “saw the pain and suffering of so many soldiers and their families, and innocent Iraqis.” He stated, “I best serve my soldiers by speaking out against unlawful orders of the highest levels of my chain of command, and making sure our leaders are held accountable.” Watada felt he “had the obligation to step up and do whatever it takes,” even if that meant facing court-martial and imprisonment.

At Watada's court-martial, the military judge refused to allow me to testify as an expert on the illegality of the Iraq War and the war crimes the Bush administration was committing there. I would have testified about the Nuremberg Charter, United Nations Charter, Geneva Conventions, Uniform Code of Military Justice, and Army Field Manual.

The judge eventually declared a mistrial. Although the government sought a second court-martial in which Watada would face six years in custody and a dishonorable discharge, the judge said double jeopardy had attached. Watada was allowed to resign from the Army and was discharged under less-than-honorable conditions.

“Lt. Watada's heroism arose in his conclusion that the invasion of Iraq was unlawful, that his participation in that unlawful invasion would abet an unlawful war of aggression, and that he would be willing to accept the consequences of his refusal to participate, despite great personal sacrifices, including nearly-total alienation from his comrades-in-arms, the potential for a lengthy prison term, and the hatred and scorn heaped upon him by untold numbers of misguided citizens,” Kenneth Kagan, one of Watada's lawyers, told Kathleen Gilberd and me for our 2009 book, Rules of Disengagement: The Politics and Honor of Military Dissent. “I have been deeply moved by his courage and steadfastness throughout.”

Pablo Paredes

I was allowed to testify as an expert at the 2005 court-martial of U.S. Navy Petty Officer Third Class Pablo Paredes, who refused orders to board an amphibious assault ship that would transport 3,000 Marines to Iraq because he thought he would be complicit as a war criminal.

The Navy charged Paredes with unauthorized absence and missing his ship's movement by design. The military judge convicted Paredes of missing movement by design but dismissed the unauthorized absence charge.

Before sentencing, Paredes told the judge, “I am guilty of believing this war is illegal. I am guilty of believing war in all forms is immoral and useless, and I am guilty of believing that as a service member I have a duty to refuse to participate in this War because it is illegal.” He added, “I believe as a member of the armed forces, beyond having a duty to my chain of command and my President, I have a higher duty to my conscience and to participate in any way, hands-on or indirect, in the current aggression that has been unleashed on Iraq.”

Although the judge refused to allow my expert testimony on the illegality of the Iraq War in the guilt phase, he did allow me to testify at the sentencing hearing.

I testified that the Iraq War violated the UN Charter, and that Paredes had a reasonable belief that by transporting Marines to Iraq, he would place them in the position of committing war crimes. I explained how U.S. forces were torturing prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison, which constituted war crimes.

Then I said that both the Nuremberg Principles and the Uniform Code of Military Justice established a duty to obey lawful orders but also a duty to disobey unlawful orders.

“It's not just the commission of war crimes, or crimes against the peace, or crimes against humanity that is punishable, but also complicity in the commission of those crimes,” I testified. Thus, if a person was “transporting someone over to Iraq to commit war crimes, they would be liable for the war crimes just the same as the person who actually committed the war crimes.”

I concluded that orders to board the ship and transport Marines to fight in an illegal war and potentially commit war crimes were unlawful. Paredes therefore had a duty to refuse those unlawful orders to embark on the ship in December 2004.

Reacting to the inept cross-examination of me by the Navy prosecutor, who bolstered my testimony, the judge ironically stated, “I think that the government has successfully proved that any service member has reasonable cause to believe that the wars in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq were illegal.”

Although the government sought nine months in the brig, forfeiture of pay and allowances, and a bad conduct discharge, the judge sentenced Paredes to no jail time and refused to order a bad conduct discharge. He gave Paredes two months restriction to the base, three months of hard labor without confinement, and a reduction in rank to seaman recruit.

“From the Vietnam War to the present, dissident soldiers have spoken out in opposition to illegitimate wars and in doing so have expanded soldiers' right to dissent,” Gilberd and I wrote in our Rules of Disengagement book. “Their legal challenges and political efforts have broadened the rights of other servicemembers opposed to a war or oppressive military policies.”

After the six members of Congress released their bold video, Veterans For Peace said in a statement:

We call on all veterans to stand with these members of Congress and amplify their message so that Airmen, Marines, Seamen, and Army troops know that if they ever face the difficult challenge of refusing an illegal order, they are carrying out their oath to defend the Constitution by following the law.

There are groups, including the GI Rights Hotline, the Center on Conscience and War, and the Military Law Task Force, that work with servicemembers to help them recognize when they have received an unlawful order and figure out their next steps.

Fighter jets track two uncrewed aircraft in first daytime breach of Romanian airspace since full-scale Ukraine war

Nato jets were scrambled to track two Russian drones that crossed into Romania on Tuesday in the deepest and first daytime incursion into the country's airspace since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine.

German Typhoon and Romanian F-16 fighter jets took off in pairs to follow the uncrewed aircraft. The first flew back into Ukrainian airspace, but the second was later found downed in Puieşti, about 70 miles from Ukraine.

Ionuț Moşteanu, Romania's defence minister, said two of the German pilots had been given orders to shoot down the second drone. In the end, he said it appeared to have crashed, possibly because it had run out fuel.

Examination of the wreckage showed the drone was unarmed, the minister added. “It could have been destroyed if all the conditions had been met ... the pilots needed to see it, to engage it, to lock it on radar and to be able to fire a missile at it.”

The first drone was detected at 6.28am local time (0428 GMT) and the second at 7.50am, the defence ministry said. People in three Romanian border counties were told to take cover in the morning until the incident was resolved.

It is the 13th time Romanian airspace has been breached by Russian drones, the third incident in the past week and the first during daytime. Villagers on the Romanian side of the border with Ukraine were evacuated last week when a tanker carrying liquefied petroleum gas was struck and caught fire in the nearby Ukrainian port of Izmail across the Danube.

Six drones also crossed into Moldova's airspace overnight, according to the country's defence ministry. One of them, a distinctive delta-wing model with a Russian Z symbol spray painted on the tailfin, landed on a roof in the village of Cuhureştii de Jos, 15 miles from the Ukrainian border.

After an inspection, the country's police said the drone was an unarmed Gerbera decoy, used by the Russians to overwhelm Ukrainian air defences and increasingly in incursions into the airspace of neighbouring countries. They suggested the drone had landed when it ran out of fuel.

In September, 21 unarmed Gerbera drones crossed into Poland in an apparently deliberate incursion by Russia. The incident led Nato to create the Eastern Sentry mission, with increased fighter jet patrols of countries on the alliance's eastern flank.

However, using fighter jets to shoot down drones is an expensive way to deal with the threat – and not always practical because of the dangers of bringing down a Russian or unknown craft above a populated area.

Gen Christopher Donahue, the commander of the US army in Europe and Africa, said on a visit to Romania's Mihail Kogǎlniceanu airbase that a new capability to shoot down drones would be deployed to the country.

“We have tested and it is in the final stages of being employed. Romanian soldiers and other alliance soldiers have been trained on this capability and I know you're going to see this capability in the delta [of the Danube] very soon,” he said.

After the Texas education chief met with the group, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick pledged $1 million toward the effort.

The Texas Tribune is a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.

Texas Education Commissioner Mike Morath recently met with a top official from Turning Point USA to discuss creating chapters of the conservative youth organization in all of the state's high schools, days before Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick promised $1 million in campaign funds to help bring the project to life.

The meeting between Morath and Turning Point USA Senior Director Josh Thifault took place on Nov. 3 in Austin, according to records obtained by The Texas Tribune. 

The two gathered in person weeks after Thifault reached out to the agency to ask when the commissioner “would like to speak with me” about the possibility of a partnership to establish Turning Point USA chapters in high schools across Texas, similar to initiatives launched in other states. 

After their meeting, Thifault followed up with Morath via email to provide additional information about the right-wing group's existing partnerships with Florida and Oklahoma. 

“Both states have issued stern warnings against anyone attempting to stop students from forming Club America chapters,” Thifault wrote, referring to the official name of the clubs. 

It is unclear if Morath formally agreed to a partnership with Turning Point USA or on any next steps. Responding to questions from the Tribune about the meeting, including how such a partnership would work and what precedent exists of the commissioner meeting with national politically affiliated organizations, Texas Education Agency spokesperson Jake Kobersky said, “Commissioner Morath meets with a variety of stakeholders interested in public education.”

Thifault did not respond to an email, phone call or text message for comment about the meeting. Doug Deason, a conservative activist and donor whom Thifault copied on the emails scheduling the conversation, also did not respond to an email from the Tribune. 

Since the Sept. 10 killing of the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk — the Turning Point USA founder praised by conservatives as a champion of free speech and criticized for comments that many found hateful toward LGBTQ+ Americans, women and people of color — Republicans' interest in the group has surged. Turning Point USA organizers have said they received tens of thousands of new inquiries about starting local chapters while claiming that students looking to participate in the organization have encountered administrative pushback. 

Officials in at least two states outside of Texas — Florida and Oklahoma — have announced plans to establish Turning Point USA clubs on their high school campuses. Oklahoma's Ryan Walters, the far-right activist who resigned as the state's education chief, previously said that students would initiate the clubs and that Turning Point USA would provide them with organizational support. Walters and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have also threatened to intervene if school leaders refuse to acknowledge the youth clubs, including by going after schools' accreditation. 

Earlier this month, four days after Morath and Thifault met, Patrick spoke out in support of establishing chapters of Turning Point USA on every Texas college and high school campus. Texas has more than 1,200 public school districts and charters that educate roughly 5.5 million students. The state has more than 200 colleges.

The Turning Point USA clubs promote themselves as champions of “American exceptionalism, the importance of constitutional rights, and standing for freedom,” according to their website. They aim to “build strong networks, spearhead impactful initiatives, help students register to vote, and inspire meaningful conversations about the foundations of a free society,” the website states. 

The organization's work on college campuses — including a so-called professor watchlist targeting instructors it sees as promoting liberal viewpoints — has also stirred tension as faculty members say they have faced harassment from conservatives. 

Ricky Adam Jr., the Texas regional manager for Turning Point USA, told lawmakers during a Nov. 12 legislative hearing that he has heard from “so many students across the state who want to get involved and want to talk peacefully and respectfully with their classmates about topics they deem important.” 

“We will put a Turning Point USA or Club America in every single high school in the state. You have my word,” Adam Jr. said. “We have a huge announcement just around the corner, so stay tuned.”

It was unclear what announcement he was referring to. Turning Point USA did not respond to the Tribune's request for comment. 

The meeting between Morath and Thifault happened several weeks after the Texas education chief announced that his agency would investigate hundreds of complaints concerning teachers accused of making inappropriate remarks about Kirk's killing. Legal experts and teacher advocacy groups criticized the investigation, calling it an attack on educators' right to free speech. 

During a Nov. 3 event at the University of Texas at Austin, Morath said that the agency had not yet disciplined any educators tied to the complaints. 

“Some of those complaints are clearly people that are personally settling scores with others they don't like, and those cases will just get closed,” Morath said. “The ones that we're going after, from an enforcement perspective, are very clearly violations of the educator code of conduct.” 

Zeph Capo, president of the Texas American Federation of Teachers, had taken issue with Morath calling for investigations into educators' social media activity. Capo told the Tribune in September that Morath, who was appointed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, was getting involved in politics by criticizing comments he personally disliked, rather than leaving it to school districts and the general public to submit any reports of alleged misconduct. 

“He should be acting as the apolitical commissioner,” Capo said at the time.

            It was the dark hair on the back of the neck, hands and chin of the elderly woman renewing her identity card that first tipped off authorities to an alleged crime and led to the arrest of a 57-year-old man in northern Italy.
    


            The man, whose name has not been released by authorities, is the son of Graziella Dall'Oglio, who died in 2022 at age 82 in the town of Borgo Virgilio, close to the city of Mantua, a spokesperson at the Mantua police precinct told CNN on Tuesday.
    


            Police say the man, a former nurse who is currently unemployed, did not report her death to authorities.
    


            When the elderly woman's identity card expired, the son put on makeup, a wig and her clothes in order to pose as his mother and renew her card – something that must be done in person in Italy, the spokesperson said.
    


            However, the agent who processed the application suspected foul play and notified authorities, who called the alleged Mrs. Dall'Oglio back to the municipal office.
    


            Surveillance footage of the parking lot shows that the man drove to the office dressed as his mother, despite the fact that she didn't hold a driver's license. Police met him there, the spokesperson said.
    


            Officers then went to the elderly woman's home address and found her mummified body in the laundry room closet, wrapped in sleeping bags, they added.
    


            The man is accused of concealing a corpse, fraud against the state, impersonation, and forgery of a public document, the spokesperson said.
    


            He is accused of removing fluids from his mother's body with a syringe to prevent decomposition, and an autopsy has been ordered to determine how she died.
    


A family of five was living off-grid in a remote cabin in central Italy. Then the courts intervened



            He remains in a local jail as prosecutors await the results of the autopsy, the police spokesperson told CNN.
    


            State pension fraud is common in Italy, with dozens of people arrested every year for impersonating someone who has died to collect their pension, according to statistics from the Italian financial crime police, known as the Guardia di Finanza.
    


            As the country's death registries and public services are not always in sync it can take years to report deaths, which means that pension checks continue to be sent out until someone notifies the local pension office from which they are dispatched.

State department proposes excluding 38 institutions from Diplomacy Lab partnership including Harvard and Yale

More than three dozen universities including Harvard, Yale, Stanford and Duke have their participation in a federal research partnership on the chopping block after the state department proposed to suspend them over their diversity, equity and inclusion hiring practices.

Last week, the Guardian obtained an internal memo and spreadsheet showing that the state department is moving to exclude 38 institutions from the Diplomacy Lab program, which pairs university researchers with state department policy offices on foreign policy projects. The suspensions would take effect on 1 January, and because the list is not finalized, the school's have not yet been informed.

The suspensions would reshape the academic partnership network, with 38 institutions removed and 10 new schools approved to join.

The targeted schools include elite universities such as Stanford University, Yale University, Johns Hopkins University, Duke University and the University of Southern California, as well as American University, George Washington University, Syracuse University and several University of California campuses.

Universities recommended to remain include Columbia University, MIT, the University of Michigan, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Virginia and the University of Texas at Austin. Several of these moved to comply with the administration's anti-DEI demands earlier this year – Columbia agreed in July to pay more than $200m to the federal government and pledged not to use “race, color, sex or national origin” in hiring decisions, while the University of Virginia's president resigned in June after the justice department demanded he step down over the school's diversity practices.

Peter Trumbore, chair of the political science department and Diplomacy Lab campus coordinator at Oakland University, which would have its funding suspended, said they've received no notification of a change. “We receive no funding from the state department for the projects that we do as Diplomacy Lab participants,” he said. “Our students have had invaluable experiences conducting research on behalf of State and working with State Department stakeholders in producing and presenting their work.”

The University of Southern California said in a statement: “The university complies with all applicable federal nondiscrimination laws and does not engage in any unlawful DEI hiring practices. We are proud of our long-standing partnerships with the federal government.” The university said it “appreciated travel funding” provided by the program for two students in 2017.

Sarah Voigt, director of communications at St Catherine University, said the school had been participating since 2020 and was first notified of a pause in Diplomacy Lab activities earlier this year on 31 January, with the program shut down “due to a lack of government funding” and did not apply for any Fall 2025 research opportunities. She added: “At this time, we are not aware of any decision to exclude St Catherine University from future research opportunities.”

The 17 November memo states that an office within the state department's bureau of public affairs will update criteria to “only include institutions with merit-based hiring practices” and exclude those with DEI hiring policies, whether implemented openly or discreetly.

The state department did not deny the memo's existence. “The Trump administration is very clear about its stance on DEI,” a spokesperson said when the Guardian first reported the story. “The state department is reviewing all programs to ensure that they are in line with the president's agenda.”

Ukraine's military intelligence agency has revealed new details of Russia's Shahed-107 attack drone used to strike front-line areas, publishing technical data on Nov. 25 that it says show the drone is packed with foreign-made components despite Western sanctions.

As is the case with other types of Shahed drones, Iran and Russia rely on electronic components from Western and other countries, such as the U.S., Switzerland, China, Japan, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and Ireland, for Shahed-107 production, according to HUR. 

"Iranian weapons continue to undergo combat testing on Ukrainian soil — in confrontation with Western defense technologies," HUR, subordinate to the Defense Ministry, said on Telegram. 

"The technological data obtained by the aggressors can be used in future destabilizing actions in various regions of the world," it added, warning that the arrival of Shahed-107 in Russia "is further evidence of the deepening cooperation between Tehran and Moscow." 

Front-line soldiers and experts reported an increase in Russia's Shahed drone usage on the front line, rather than in the rear, in recent months — further complicating Ukrainian logistics. 

The interviewees who spoke to the Kyiv Independent in August believed that Russia is likely looking to conserve KAB guided aerial bombs where possible to prepare for a long war ahead. 

Russian troops have been deploying Shahed-type drones, relatively cheap, self-destructing loitering munitions for nearly a year on the front, but they appear to be building additional launch sites, such as at the Russian-occupied Luhansk airport, to further intensify their usage, Ukrainian aviation expert Anatolii Khrapchynskyi said in August.

HUR said the Shahed-107, first unveiled by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in June amid intensifying Israeli-Iranian hostilities, carries a 15-kilogram fragmentation warhead similar to other Shahed models. The drone is made of carbon fiber and aluminum and has an X-shaped tail for stabilization. HUR added that it has a fuel capacity of 28 liters and a range of about 300 kilometers (around 186 miles).

Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian Il-76 heavy transport aircraft as well as an experimental A-60 airborne laser complex, according to Robert "Madyar" Brovdi, commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, on Nov. 25.



"We look forward to organizing a visit of Ukraine's president to the U.S. at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal with President (Donald) Trump," said Rustem Umerov, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council.

Ukraine's military intelligence agency has revealed new details of Russia's Shahed-107 attack drone used to strike front-line areas.

A Ukrainian army of this size would still remain the second-largest European force after Russia and put it close to its current wartime strength of about 900,000 service members.

Several multistory residential buildings caught fire and at least six people have been killed in what the Energy Ministry called "a massive combined attack...on infrastructure facilities."

"Keeping the assets permanently 'on ice' or turning them into a bargaining chip between Russia and another power only prolongs the conflict," Iryna Mudra, deputy head of President Volodymyr Zelensky's office in charge of legal matters, told the Kyiv Independent in an email. 

Romania, a NATO and EU member state located just below Ukraine, reported that it detected two drone incursions this morning. 



In Taganrog, Rostov Oblast, a fire reportedly broke out at the Beriev Aircraft Company, which produces Russian amphibious seaplanes and the rare A-50 spy plane. 

The revised version is more aligned with Ukraine's position, but negotiating a final agreement is "very difficult," President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 25. 

A Czech company has been accused of selling Chinese-made drones to Ukraine at steep markups — sometimes nearly 20 times the original price — and is under investigation for alleged tax evasion, Czech media reported on Nov. 24.

Lawsuit filed in West Virginia maintained that Justice and his wife received notice of the funds due since 2009 but didn't pay

Jim Justice, the Republican US senator, and his wife have agreed to pay more than $5m that the couple owes in back taxes shortly after they were sued over the 16-year-old debt by the federal government.

The lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court in their home state of West Virginia, maintained that the Justices had received notice from the US treasury department of the funds due since 2009 but had “neglected or refused to make full payment of those assessments”.

The suit demanded that Jim and Cathy Justice – a member of West Virginia's state board of education – pay back the balance of nearly $5.2m along with any other relief that the court deemed “just and proper”.

A separate filing later on Monday said the US justice department had struck a settlement with the political couple, who agreed to satisfy the full amount “plus statutory interest and other additions to tax accruing thereafter”. The agreement was pending a judge's approval.

Justice's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment early on Tuesday. He had previously sought to dismiss as political attacks attempts to collect on financial debts for which he was on the hook.

Monday's lawsuit against Justice – a coal mining heir – and his wife came after the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in October filed more than $8m in liens against the Justices over unpaid personal taxes.

Furthermore, West Virginia tax collectors placed a $1.4m lien on the luxurious Greenbrier hotel resort that their family owns and operates in White Sulphur Springs, a community in the Alleghany Mountains.

The Justice family only narrowly avoided foreclosure for the Greenbrier by reaching an agreement with a credit collection company in August 2024. They bought the 246-year-old property – whose guests have included US presidents from Martin van Buren to Donald Trump – out of bankruptcy in 2009 for $20.1m.

Jim Justice, who is also the owner of various other businesses, was once considered to be West Virginia's wealthiest resident. But more than $1bn of collective debt has resulted in his having a projected net worth of “less than zero”, according to a Forbes report from January.

Despite his financial troubles, Jim Justice served as West Virginia's governor for eight years beginning in 2017. He then won election to the US Senate, taking over a seat vacated by the retirement of his fellow West Virginia coal tycoon Joe Manchin, a Democrat.

Speaking with local media in October, Justice claimed that there were political motives behind the collection efforts against him, the Associated Press reported. He argued at the time that his businesses “are complicated and complex” – and that his children had been “doing a magnificent job” running them.

“At the end of the day, I'd say just let it be and see how it plays out,” Justice said, according to the AP.

A peace plan discussed and approved by Ukrainian and U.S. officials would limit Ukraine's peacetime military to 800,000 service members, the Financial Times reported on Nov. 25, citing unnamed Ukrainian officials.

A Ukrainian army of this size would still remain the second-largest European force after Russia and put it close to its current wartime strength of about 900,000 service members.

The news comes after an initial peace plan, presented by Washington last week and criticized for conditions heavily favoring Russia, proposed limiting Ukrainian forces to 600,000 troops.

The original 28-point document was condensed to 19 points after U.S.-Ukrainian consultations in Geneva, although its full content has not been made public. 

The most sensitive issues, namely those related to territory, are to be addressed later by U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. 

While a U.S. official cited by CBS News said that Ukraine has "agreed" to the revised peace deal, Moscow's position remains unclear.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russia has not officially received the new version, but warned that Moscow would reject it if it fails to meet its long-standing demands.

"There are a few delicate, but not insurmountable, details that must be sorted out and will require further talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the United States," said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.

Ukraine has not publicly confirmed agreeing to restricting its military size. The Kyiv Independent has reached out to Ukraine's Foreign Ministry for comment.

Kyiv has long maintained that any limits on its armed forces represent a "red line" that it is not willing to cross.

The cap of 800,000 troops mirrors a counter-proposal reportedly pitched earlier by the U.K., France, and Germany in response to the U.S. 28-point document.

The final version of the peace plan, designed to bring an end to the full-scale war ongoing for nearly four years, remains unclear as the U.S. reportedly held fresh talks with Ukraine and Russia in Abu Dhabi.

While Trump vowed to bring a swift end to the Russia-Ukraine war, his efforts have failed to achieve a breakthrough in his first 10 months in office as Moscow continues to reject a ceasefire and pushes territorial demands, including for Kyiv to cede the entire Donbas region.

A Ukrainian army of this size would still remain the second-largest European force after Russia and put it close to its current wartime strength of about 900,000 service members.

Several multistory residential buildings caught fire and at least six people have been killed in what the Energy Ministry called "a massive combined attack...on infrastructure facilities."

"Keeping the assets permanently 'on ice' or turning them into a bargaining chip between Russia and another power only prolongs the conflict," Iryna Mudra, deputy head of President Volodymyr Zelensky's office in charge of legal matters, told the Kyiv Independent in an email. 

Romania, a NATO and EU member state located just below Ukraine, reported that it detected two drone incursions this morning. 



In Taganrog, Rostov Oblast, a fire reportedly broke out at the Beriev Aircraft Company, which produces Russian amphibious seaplanes and the rare A-50 spy plane. 

The revised version is more aligned with Ukraine's position, but negotiating a final agreement is "very difficult," President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Nov. 25. 

A Czech company has been accused of selling Chinese-made drones to Ukraine at steep markups — sometimes nearly 20 times the original price — and is under investigation for alleged tax evasion, Czech media reported on Nov. 24.

The report comes amid speculation that the President's Office was allegedly preparing to retaliate against Klymenko and Arakhamia over their independent stances on a large-scale corruption scandal at state nuclear power monopoly Energoatom.

            The Vatican has issued a warning against the rise of polyamory, insisting marriage is the stable, lifelong and exclusive partnership between a man and woman.
    


            A new document defending monogamy, signed off by Pope Leo XIV, was written as “various public forms of non-monogamous unions – sometimes called ‘polyamory' – are growing in the West,” the text said. It also followed discussions with Roman Catholic bishops in Africa about polygamy, which has been described as a “pastoral challenge” for the church in the region and was discussed by Vatican assemblies (synods) in 2023 and 2024.
    


            Polygamy tends to refer to one man with multiple wives, while polyamory involves people having multiple consensual romantic relationships at once.
    


            “Polygamy, adultery, or polyamory are based on the illusion that the intensity of the relationship can be found in a succession of faces,” states the doctrinal note, titled “One Flesh – In Praise of Monogamy.” “Our age, in fact, is experiencing various drifts with regard to love: an increase in divorces, the fragility of unions, the trivialization of adultery, and the promotion of polyamory.”
    


            The 40-page document emphasizes the importance of marriage between man and a woman, with Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernández, the prefect of the Vatican's doctrine office, saying it is aimed at setting out the reasons for “the choice of a unique and exclusive union of love, a rich and total belonging to one another.”
    


Catholic Church must do more to help sexual abuse survivors and hold church leaders to account, hard-hitting report says



            The note also says it is highlighting a development in the church's understanding of sex within marriage: namely that is about more than having children.
    


            In Catholic understanding, sex within marriage has two aspects: the “unitive,” which brings the couple closer together and can reflect divine love, and the “procreative,” meaning having children. Catholic teaching forbids the use of artificial contraception – a prohibition upheld by recent popes but which has been hotly debated and rejected by some in the church.
    


            The latest doctrinal note says that “unity is the founding property” of marriage and that the “unitive purpose of sexuality… is not limited to ensuring procreation.”

Judge says interim US attorney for eastern district of Virginia had ‘no lawful authority' to indict former FBI director and New York attorney general. Plus, where did all the color go from the movies?

Good morning.

A federal judge threw out the criminal cases against James Comey and Letitia James yesterday, concluding that the prosecutor handling the cases was unlawfully appointed.

Lindsey Halligan, whom Trump named the interim US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia in September, had “no lawful authority to present the indictment” against the former FBI director and the New York attorney general, judge Cameron McGowan Currie wrote in her opinion.

The decision is a major win for Comey, who was charged with lying to Congress five years ago, and James, who was charged with mortgage fraud. Both unequivocally deny wrongdoing and said the cases were a thinly veiled effort by the Trump administration to punish them for opposing the president.

What did the judge say? “I conclude that the attorney general's attempt to install Ms Halligan as interim US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia was invalid and that Ms Halligan has been unlawfully serving in that role since 22 September 2025,” wrote Currie, who was appointed to the bench by Bill Clinton.

Russia launched a missile and drone attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure overnight, killing six people and injuring 14 in Kyiv as a fresh round of US-brokered peace negotiations began in Abu Dhabi.

A total of 22 missiles, including four hypersonic Kinzhals, and 464 drones, were fired by Russia in attacks that principally targeted Kyiv and the surrounding area, according to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

“All partners must remember that lives need to be saved every single day,” said Zelenskyy. “Weapons and air defence systems are important, as is the sanctions pressure on the aggressor. There can be no pauses in assistance.”

When did the talks begin? Reports emerged that a fresh round of US-brokered peace talks had begun last night in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, with Dan Driscoll, the US army secretary, flying in to meet a Russian delegation and a Ukrainian team led by Kyrylo Budanov.

Venezuela's government has accused the US of peddling “ridiculous hogwash” about its supposed role in sponsoring “narco-terrorism”, as Washington continued to turn up the heat on Nicolás Maduro's regime, and leftwing European politicians warned that South America faced being plunged into “a torrent of bloodshed”.

On Monday, the Trump administration officially designated a Venezuelan group known as the Cártel de los Soles (the Cartel of the Suns) a terrorist organization – despite widespread doubts over its actual existence.

What might happen next? Observers believe yesterday's decision by the US state department – which accuses Maduro of leading the putative group – could open the door for some kind of imminent US military intervention on Venezuela soil.

The Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, has told Donald Trump that Beijing's claims to Taiwan remain unchanged, in a phone call that came amid rising tensions over the self-governing island.

The Trump administration announced it would cancel temporary asylum for about 10,000 Myanmar nationals, despite the country being ruled by a military dictatorship with a record of executing dissidents.

In the corridors of US colleges and business schools, Northwestern recruiters push the dream of a blue chip career in finance.

Dozens of ministers representing 17 groups of countries, from the poorest to the richest, sat together in a room for 12 hours urged by the Brazilian hosts to accept a settlement cooked up the day before. The negotiations almost collapsed. It took some oblique wording, but Saudi Arabia finally made a last-minute decision to sign a deal that marks a departure for Cop.

A woman in Thailand shocked temple staff when she started moving in her coffin after being brought in for cremation. Pairat Soodthoop from the temple said they heard a faint knock coming from the box. “I was a bit surprised, so I asked them to open the coffin, and everyone was startled,” he said.

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba BABA-N beat analysts' estimates for quarterly revenue on Tuesday as investments in one-hour delivery helped drive more users to its shopping apps, while its cloud division reported strong growth.

U.S.-listed shares of the company rose 4 per cent in premarket trading.

The company reported revenue of 247.80-billion yuan ($49.39-billion) in the second quarter, compared with estimates of 242.65-billion yuan, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Alibaba's results come against the backdrop of a costly battle in China's “instant retail” sector – which Alibaba calls “quick commerce” – where major players are pouring billions into one-hour delivery services to capture market share.

At the same time Alibaba has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence, emerging as one of China's leaders in the field.

“We have entered into an investment phase to build long-term strategic value in AI technologies and infrastructure, and a consumption platform integrating daily life services and e-commerce,” said Alibaba Group CEO Eddie Wu.

Net profit fell 53 per cent to 20.61-billion yuan, though that was still higher than analysts had expected.

The instant-retail price war, triggered by aggressive discounting and subsidies from Alibaba, JD.com JD-Q and Meituan, has led to heavy cash burn – analysts at Nomura estimate over US$4-billion ($5.65-billion) industry-wide in the second quarter alone – and raised investor concerns about margins.

Alibaba is less exposed than rivals, yet it sees long-term upside, projecting instant retail could add 1-trillion yuan in annualized gross merchandise value – or GMV, a commonly used metric for e-commerce sales – over the next three years.

Analysts eye China ‘Singles Day' sales as many consumers cut back

China's Singles' Day sales period – the longest on record, stretching from early October to Nov. 11 – also saw retailers roll out heavy subsidies and discounts to spur demand.

Sales across major platforms reached 1.70-trillion yuan, up from 1.44 trillion yuan last year, according to data provider Syntun.

Alibaba continued to push overseas expansion during the event. Its Taobao marketplace launched Singles' Day promotions in more than 20 countries.

The company overall saw 9.3-per-cent sales growth from the event, while rival JD.com saw 8.3 per cent, according to tech and commerce consulting firm Analysys.

Alibaba has been making aggressive moves to expand into the consumer artificial-intelligence market, an area in which it has traditionally lagged rivals as it focused instead on enterprise clients.

Recently it launched a free app built on the latest version of its Qwen large language model, which surpassed 10 million downloads within its first week. It still has a long way to go to catch market leader ByteDance's Doubao, which has 150 million users.

Alibaba's consumer-facing shift comes amid an intensifying price war in China's domestic AI market, sparked by DeepSeek's focus on low-cost computing and app development – a strategy that has forced rivals to slash prices and follow suit.

Toothpod sounds like a product Willy Wonka would create: a chewing gum that cleans your mouth. It's the brainchild of University of Toronto health studies graduate Vishar Yaghoubian, who has become one of Canada's most hyped emerging entrepreneurs, winning $200,000-plus in prizes from more than 25 startup competitions based on the idea. 

She has attracted big-name investors to back her eight-person company, including New York hedge fund manager Mark Diker, Dragon's Den star Michele Romanow and Michael Cloutier, a former AstraZeneca Canada president. 

U of T promotes Ms. Yaghoubian as one of its emerging entrepreneurial stars, and she already has a flourishing online presence, with 11,500 followers on Instagram (where she once did a sponsored post for Doritos), nearly twice as many on TikTok and 8,400 on LinkedIn. She was featured in a 2022 calendar celebrating 12 young women pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. 

“She is a brand unto herself,” says Lesley Ross, general partner of Enjoy the Work, a Silicon Valley group that advises startup founder CEOs, including Ms. Yaghoubian. “A big, beautiful force of nature.”

Now, the vibrant, intense 25-year-old Torontonian is set to discover what the market thinks and try living up to a reputation that precedes any actual business success.

Toothpod launches this week, and will initially be distributed through dental offices and sold online to consumers. Already nearly half of Toothpod's initial run of 216,000 pieces (which retail for $1 each) are spoken for in advance orders; a second run is under way and Toothpod's U.S. contract manufacturer can make one million of the disc-shaped chewables a week. 

“I'm ecstatic, relieved, because it's real,” Ms. Yaghoubian said of the launch. “The hard work is just beginning.”

One of her first clients is an Atlanta cosmetic dentistry business whose celebrity clientele includes music stars Usher and Nicki Minaj. The clinic's parent company, Sarasota, Fla.-based Dental Care Alliance, plans to roll it out to its 400 locations across 22 states in the coming months to include in patient dental goodie bags. 

“They're all excited for it,” says Colleen McFarlin, vice-president of the DCA's specialty division. “I think it's a game-changer in the industry and should be part of the standard of care in every daily routine.” 

Toothpod combines three natural ingredients that have been shown in studies to have a positive impact on oral health: hydroxyapatite, which helps re-mineralize teeth and is used in specialty toothpaste brands including Sensodyne; magnolia bark extract, which decreases bacteria in the mouth that cause bad breath and tooth decay; and resveratrol, a plant extract with anti-inflammatory properties. Toothpod also contains xylitol, a sweetener used in other gums that reduces plaque, gingival bleeding and inflammation.

The company has received a provisional patent and is now pursuing clinical validation: An American university is about to begin a trial of 50 healthy adults who will chew the product four times daily for two weeks to see if it delivers oral health benefits.

The founders claim that early, non-clinical tests show that chewing the product for a few minutes removes twice as much plaque as other xylitol gums. “We don't need trials to go to market,” Ms. Yaghoubian says. “We can do marketing like any other company. But that is not my goal. I want something that will make an actual difference in the world. That means we need real clinical trials.” 

The idea for Toothpod was born in 2019 when Ms. Yaghoubian took part in a startup competition at U of T's Hatchery accelerator. The Iranian immigrant, who moved to Canada with her family 14 years ago, had shown an entrepreneurial flair since her early teens, selling her services as a neighbourhood dog walker and nail aesthetician, and busking with her violin while travelling.

Challenged in the competition to come up with a business idea within 24 hours, she did an internet search on the world's top problems. She discovered cavities were a big chronic health issue, despite the fact people have used toothbrushes for centuries. Her idea was to create a portable oral care product that people could use on the go. Her team won $1,000.

While juggling her studies, a job coaching the women's varsity basketball team and two terms on U of T's governing council, she started building her company in earnest. Ms. Yaghoubian considered a range of oral care products including devices, lozenges, mints, gummies and even a Pop Rocks-type consumable. 

She reached out to hundreds of academics for help and zeroed in on the three active ingredients she thought her product should include. In 2021, she recruited Brian Webb, a biomechanical engineering PhD student at U of T, to help with product development. He became chief technology officer and co-founder. By late 2021, they zeroed in on gum as their product.

Working in their kitchens, they tested dozens of formulations. Mr. Webb says he would break chunks of chicle – a brown natural gum base – into wells of a muffin tin, warming them on his stove and mixing in various measurements of ingredients to see what worked. He'd roll samples into pieces with his fingers and pop them in his mouth. Some were too soft, too sweet or too sticky. He learned the active ingredients had to be carefully mixed in or they would create a burning sensation or bitter taste when chewed.

Finally, Mr. Webb came up with the winning concoction some time in 2023. Ms. Yaghoubian says she fought back tears when she tasted it. “We were so surprised by how delicious it was,” she says. “I could see the future.”

Working with a food scientist at their contract manufacturer, a large U.S. gum maker, the product was further refined. By early 2024, the first batch of commercial-grade 500 sample pieces – each 16 millimetres in diameter and eight millimetres tall, which is larger than a typical piece of gum – was ready to send to clinics and investors. 

Within months, Ms. Yaghoubian had raised $850,000, on top of $450,000 in government grants. “There's nothing like it and I believe there is tremendous value that will be created as we move through commercialization of the brand,” said Mr. Cloutier, who has backed 10 startups. “It hit all the buttons for me.”

Toothpods come in single, metal-lined pouches like premium tea bags and are sold in boxes of 20. Ms. Yaghoubian says “selling will be the least of our issues. We have to have inventory. We need to make sure we have product.”

Her advisers and mentors agree. “The key risk in this business will be inventory management and working capital,” says Reza Satchu, co-founder of Next Canada, a program for high-potential student founders, where Ms. Yaghoubian earned the people's choice award last year. “If she hits gold, which I think she has a shot at, will she be able to scale the business? That's not an easy thing.” 

Toothpod needs to figure out unit costs and pricing and which retail channels to pursue next. The company will need to raise more funds and ensure further product ambitions – like developing a mouthwash – don't stretch its resources too thinly. 

The key challenge facing Ms. Yaghoubian, says Ms. Ross, “is not to be distracted by all the brilliant opportunities that come her way.”

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. at the inaugural Make America Healthy Again summit in Washington earlier this month.Rod Lamkey/The Associated Press

Sometime, in the not-too-distant future, we're going to look back and wonder: Whatever happened to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at one time the single most powerful and influential public-health agency on Earth?

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (which oversees the CDC), and a fervent anti-vaccine activist, seems hell-bent on using his position to destroy the CDC.

Last week, in his latest salvo, Mr. Kennedy personally instructed the agency to change its long-standing position that vaccines do not cause autism. 

Before the update, the CDC website said studies have shown that there is “no link” between vaccines and developing autism, and that “no links” have been found between any vaccine ingredients and the disorder.

The page now says that studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism “have been ignored by health authorities.”

Then it adds: “The claim ‘vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.”

RFK Jr. says he told CDC to change position on vaccines and autism

This is preposterous, and doubly so because the change was ordered by a politician with no training in science, medicine or public health. 

What Mr. Kennedy does have is a long-standing animus toward vaccination, and he has now co-opted and weaponized a powerful public-health agency toward his cause. The Health Secretary's claims are false, misleading and harmful. 

Mr. Kennedy faux-innocently says he is not saying vaccines cause autism, just that studies have not shown that they can't. 

But he knows full well that a negative cannot be proven. As Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University, said to The New York Times: “You can't prove that Coca-Cola doesn't cause autism either.”

Research has shown quite clearly that there is no link between measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination and autism. Those studies were made necessary by explosive claims in a paper published by Andrew Wakefield – a paper that was later withdrawn because the findings were manipulated. But not before terrible damage was done.

Mr. Kennedy and his ilk are now “wondering” about another routine childhood vaccine for DTaP – a combination shot that protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough) in young children. 

And, every now and again, he just tosses out weird new theories, like autism is caused by pregnant women taking Tylenol. Sorry, that should read: You can't prove it doesn't. 

These are the common tactics of anti-vaxxers and other embracers of anti-science: Keep moving the goal posts, and then claim you're “only asking questions.” 

Mr. Kennedy's goal is clear: To foment confusion and distrust in vaccines. 

It's surely a coincidence that, over the years, he has made millions promoting anti-vaccine views and referring clients to law firms that sue governments and pharmaceutical companies on behalf of parents of “vaccine-damaged” children. 

Mr. Kennedy has been on a crusade against the CDC for years. He has called it a “cesspool of corruption” and claimed its officials are in bed with Big Pharma – all without evidence, it goes without saying.

Since becoming HHS Secretary this year, Mr. Kennedy has not just rewritten web pages. He has fired at least one-quarter of its staff, including the CDC director; dismantled its expert vaccine advisory panel; slashed the agency budget by roughly a third; cut the US$500-million research program for promising mRNA vaccines; slashed the infectious diseases program, both abroad and domestically (in the midst of the biggest measles outbreak in 30 years, no less); and, called for the CDC to abandon its chronic disease prevention activities. 

Death by a thousand cuts, literally.

Mr. Kennedy is engaging in similar patterns of destruction at two other agencies he oversees, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, but not with the same fervour he has reserved for the CDC. 

All this, presumably, to Make America Healthy Again. 

Inviting back the spread of childhood illness and its related impacts – including the potential for childhood mortality – seems like an odd way of achieving this goal. 

But it's all about ideology. The desire to be free of any regulations you don't like. The freedom to choose what you believe, even if it's dangerously wrong. The supremacy of the individual, regardless of the cost to the collective. 

Seems like Donald's Trump's prescription for an angry nation is an unhinged health secretary.

We can't but shudder to think how much damage will be done before Mr. Kennedy is through with his crusade, or how long public health, in the United States and beyond, will take to recover and rebuild.

U.S. authorities believe fugitive Ryan Wedding is hiding in Mexico and last week upped the bounty for his capture to US$15-million.Andrew Harnik/Getty Images

Yuri, the burly man the two Canadians thought was a former KGB agent, became very upset at them right after they landed in Los Angeles from Vancouver. Where was the money, he asked? Why hadn't they brought money for the cocaine?

One of the Canadians, the tall one Yuri knew as the athlete, retorted that he certainly wasn't going to fly across borders with a suitcase full of cash.

Those words would later be used against the tall man, the former Olympian Ryan Wedding, who was eventually found guilty of conspiring to distribute cocaine.

A timeline of Ryan Wedding's shift from Olympic snowboarder to alleged drug kingpin and FBI fugitive

Who are the Canadians facing charges connected to Ryan Wedding?

His past as an elite athlete was mentioned in the opening statements at his 2009 trial, when his lawyer told jurors that Mr. Wedding was a former national team snowboarder, an upstanding young man tricked into a tawdry scheme.

Today, Mr. Wedding is 44 and one of the world's most wanted fugitives, allegedly the boss of a billion-dollar trafficking ring. American authorities believe he is hiding in Mexico and last week upped the bounty for his capture to US$15-million.

Officials also announced last week a slew of new arrests, many of them in Canada and linked to the murder of a key witness in Medellín, Colombia, allegedly on the order of Mr. Wedding. 

But his first encounter with the American justice system happened nearly two decades earlier, when he was swept up in a cross-border drug trafficking investigation. The details of that case, included in more than 1,200 pages of transcripts from his subsequent jury trial, shed light on his activities long before he made international headlines and began being compared to Pablo Escobar.

Mr. Wedding was just 25 when the FBI arrested him, six years after he represented Canada at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. Prosecutors alleged that he and two associates travelled from British Columbia to California to buy hundreds of thousands of dollars of cocaine that they planned to resell at twice the price in Canada.

Mr. Wedding hadn't initially been on the radar of U.S. law enforcement. FBI Special Agent Brett Kalina testified that investigators only became aware of the former Olympian's involvement when they saw him exit the customs gate at Los Angeles International Airport on June 10, 2008.

His travelling companion, Hassan Shirani, chose to co-operate with the FBI after being caught.

Mr. Shirani, a Vancouver drug dealer of Iranian origin, was familiar with the hawala, the money-transfer system where cash is handed to a local broker, who would supply a code word to get a trusted partner in another country to disburse money.

He testified that he previously arranged for Mr. Wedding to move US$250,000 to California via hawala. However, Mr. Wedding told Mr. Shirani afterward that the recipient stole the money instead of getting him narcotics.

Mr. Shirani agreed to set up another deal for Mr. Wedding and put him in touch with two Vancouver men, Michael Krapchan and Elmar Akhundov, who knew a cocaine supplier in San Diego, Yuri.

Unbeknownst to them, the FBI was investigating Mr. Akhundov for money laundering and drug trafficking, according to an affidavit by Mr. Kalina.

The British Columbia men decided to buy 24 kilograms, worth US$340,000. Mr. Krapchan flew out first to connect with Yuri.

The court heard that Yuri Trofimov was once a presidential bodyguard in Kazakhstan. The Canadians thought he was a former KGB officer. They didn't know he was co-operating with the FBI.

Mr. Krapchan was recorded on a wiretap telling Mr. Trofimov that two men would arrive from Canada to finalize the deal: an Iranian and a tall athlete.

Mr. Shirani and Mr. Wedding were met at the airport by Mr. Krapchan and Mr. Trofimov.

They weren't aware Mr. Trofimov carried hidden recorders in a pocket and a key fob. He told them he wanted to complete the deal in San Diego right away.

The Canadians explained that they didn't have the cash yet. “We have to go get it. I mean, obviously, I didn't put it in my ... suitcase,” Mr. Wedding said. 

Mr. Shirani testified that Mr. Trofimov became very agitated but finally agreed to return empty-handed to San Diego.

Mr. Wedding and Mr. Shirani remained in Los Angeles and went to the hawala broker, in the backroom of a Persian rug store, where stacks of cash were taken out of a safe for them to count.

Mr. Shirani eventually retrieved a first sum of US$100,000, wrapped in newspapers and stuffed into a plastic bag. He hid it under the bottom drawer of the TV dresser in their room at the Comfort Inn, on Ventura Boulevard.

On June 13, they drove down to San Diego.

Mr. Krapchan left to buy an initial one-kilo sample from Mr. Trofimov. The other two waited in his room at the Hampton Inn. Mr. Shirani was anxious and had a headache. Mr. Wedding took a nap.

After 90 minutes, they left the room to get some food. FBI agents waited outside the hotel to arrest them, having already nabbed Mr. Krapchan.

Another Canadian arrested in connection to alleged role in Ryan Wedding case

On the first trial day, Mr. Wedding scribbled a note to his sister in the audience. It was intercepted. It said: “See you soon, dear. Ha, ha. Miss you, love you, Ryan.”

Over the rest of the sheet, he had repeatedly written “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy” – like the main character in the horror movie The Shining.

Looking at the note, District Judge Jeffrey Miller remarked that Mr. Wedding seemed to be “taking this pretty lightly.”

Two days later, Mr. Wedding tried to pass another note. “Tell him to knock it off,” the judge admonished David Denis, the defence lawyer.

Mr. Denis put Mr. Wedding's mother on the stand to testify about her son.

“Was he raised to be trusting?” Mr. Denis asked Karen Wedding, a registered nurse.

“Absolutely,” she replied.

The jury didn't buy it and found Mr. Wedding guilty.

“I allowed myself to be lured by the idea of easy money ... what I did was completely out of character for me,” he assured the judge before he was sentenced.

He received a four-year jail term and was released at the end of 2011.

Within four years, he was in trouble with the law again. In 2015, the RCMP issued a warrant for his arrest, alleging that he was smuggling cocaine from St. Kitts to Montreal via Newfoundland. He has been a fugitive ever since.

The US has formally labeled the ‘Cartel of the Suns', a purported criminal syndicate said to operate within Venezuela's security services, as a foreign terrorist organization – placing it in the same category as Al-Qaeda and Islamic State.

Announcing the decision on Thursday, the US Treasury repeated long-standing allegations that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whose legitimacy Washington disputes, leads the network.

The move comes after nearly two months of US airstrikes on small boats off Venezuela's coast, which the Pentagon says are aimed at “narcoterrorism” and which have left around 80 people dead.

The term ‘Cartel of the Suns' originated in the 1990s as a media reference to alleged corruption among Venezuelan military officers who reportedly wore Sun-shaped insignia on their uniforms. In 2020, the US indicted Maduro and 14 current or former officials on accusations of drug trafficking and organized crime, claiming that they collectively ran the cartel.

Numerous analysts and regional leaders, however, have cast doubt on the cartel's existence. While acknowledging that individual officials may be involved in illicit schemes, skeptics argue that claims of a centralized, hierarchical criminal enterprise are unfounded.

Justice Minister Diosdado Cabello, one of the Venezuelan officials charged by the US, said the Americans label anyone who “bothers them” as cartel members. Colombian President Gustavo Petro dismissed the Cartel of the Suns as a “fictional excuse of the far right to bring down governments that do not obey them.”

During US President Donald Trump's first term, Washington recognized opposition figure Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader, though his subsequent attempts to overthrow Maduro failed.

The recent US strikes in the Caribbean, combined with a buildup of military assets in the region, have fueled speculation that Washington may be preparing for a renewed effort to remove Maduro from power.

BEIJING, November 25. /TASS/. The total value of Russia's natural resources exceeds $100 trillion, which is nearly twice that of the United States, Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin said at the Russia-China Energy Business Forum.

"Russia, with its unique resource base, can guarantee the energy security of all Eurasia. The total value of our country's natural wealth amounts to nearly $100 trillion, which is almost twice the comparable figure for the United States," he said.

Sechin noted that Russia is a key player in the global energy market, accounting for approximately 15% of global hydrocarbon exports.

Nvidia and some other chip stocks slumped after a report said Meta Platforms was in talks to spend billions on Google's AI semiconductors. The AI chip giant was down as much as 7% in early trading, then recovered some of that loss in midday trading. It was recently down about 4%.

Google's parent Alphabet pared early gains, extending its recent surge toward a $4 trillion valuation. Nasdaq lagged behind the other major stock indexes as all three recovered from their morning lows. The Dow industrials rose more than 1%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7% and the Nasdaq was up about 0.5%.

Shutdown-delayed economic data was also in focus. Retail sales rose 0.2% in September from August, undershooting expectations, while producer prices ticked up 0.3%, in line with forecasts. That is among the last inflation readings before the Federal Reserve's rate decision. Rising expectations for a cut have buoyed markets in recent days.

A separate weekly report from ADP indicated the private sector shed 13,500 jobs a week in the four weeks through Nov. 8.

A series of retailers—Best Buy, Dick's Sporting Goods, Burlington Stores and Kohl's—raised annual guidance. Chains, including Walmart, have logged strong results this reporting season, suggesting a solid holiday shopping season ahead.

McALLEN, Texas (AP) — Yaakub Vijandre was preparing to go to work as a mechanic when six vehicles appeared outside his Dallas-area home. Federal agents jumped out, one pointed a weapon at him, and they took him into custody.

Vijandre is a recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that has shielded hundreds of thousands of people from deportation since 2012 if they were brought to the United States as children and generally stayed out of trouble. The Trump administration said it targeted Vijandre over social media posts. The freelance videographer and pro-Palestinian activist described his early October arrest to his attorneys, who relayed the information to reporters.

His arrest and several others this year signal a change in how the U.S. is handling DACA recipients as President Donald Trump's administration reshapes immigration policy more broadly. The change comes as immigrants have face increased vetting, including of their social media, when they apply for visas, green cards, citizenship, or to request the release of their children from federal custody. The administration also has sought to deport foreign students for participating in pro-Palestinian activism.

DACA was created to shield recipients, commonly referred to as “Dreamers,” from immigration arrests and deportation. It also allows them to legally work in the U.S. Recipients reapply every two years. Previously if their status was in jeopardy, they would receive a warning and would still have a chance to fight it before immigration officers detained them and began efforts to deport them.

In response to questions about any changes, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement saying that people “who claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are not automatically protected from deportations. DACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country.” DACA recipients can lose status “for a number of reasons, including if they've committed a crime,” she said.

McLaughlin also claimed in a statement that Vijandre made social media posts “glorifying terrorism,” including one she said celebrated Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, al-Qaida's leader in Iraq who was killed in a U.S. strike in 2006. 




An attorney for Vijandre, Chris Godshall-Bennett, said Vijandre's social media activity is “clearly” protected speech. He also said the government has not provided details about the specific posts in court documents. 

Vijandre is among about 20 DACA recipients who have been arrested or detained by immigration authorities since Trump took office in January, according to Home is Here, a campaign created by pro-DACA advocacy groups. The administration is seeking to end his DACA status, which could result in him being deported to the Philippines, a home he has not visited since his family came to the U.S. in 2001, when he was 14.

DACA survived the first Trump administration's attempt to rescind the program when the Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that the administration did not take the proper steps to end it.

There have been other attempts to end the program or place restrictions on recipients.

This year, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that would deny work permits for DACA recipients who live in Texas. The Trump administration recently presented its plans to a federal judge who is determining how it will work.

The administration also has issued new restrictions on commercial driver's licenses that would prevent DACA recipients and some other immigrants from getting them. Last year, 19 Republican states stripped DACA recipients' access to health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. And the number of states where immigrant students can qualify for in-state tuition has dwindled since the Justice Department began suing states this year.

“This administration might not be trying to end DACA altogether the way that they did the first time around, but they are chipping away at it,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, spokesperson for United We Dream, which is part of Home is Here, the coalition keeping track of public cases of DACA recipients who have been detained.

Catalina “Xóchitl” Santiago Santiago, a 28-year-old activist from El Paso, Texas, was arrested in August despite showing immigration officers a valid work permit obtained through DACA. 

Days later, federal officers arrested Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira as the 28-year-old father was arriving at his El Paso home with his children following a doctor's appointment. Agents dislocated his shoulder, according to his attorneys. 

Both Santiago and Gamez Lira were held for over a month while their attorneys petitioned for their release. 

Marisa Ong, an attorney for Santiago and Gamez Lira, said the government failed to notify either of her clients of any intention to terminate their DACA status. 

“DACA recipients have a constitutionally protected interest in their continued liberty,” Ong said, adding that “the government cannot take away that liberty without providing some valid reason.”

DACA recipients can lose their status if they are convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanors like those involving harming others, driving under the influence or drug distribution, or three or more misdemeanors. They can also lose their status if they pose a threat to national security or public safety.

DHS claimed in a statement that Santiago was previously charged with trespassing, possession of narcotics and drug paraphernalia and that Gamez Lira was previously arrested for marijuana possession. 

Ong said that when attorneys sought their release “the government presented no evidence of any past misconduct by either individual.” 

Vijandre, the Dallas-area man who was arrested in October, remains in a Georgia detention facility. His attorneys say he received notice two weeks before his arrest that the government planned to terminate his DACA status but that he wasn't given a chance to fight it. 

“I think that the administration has drawn a very clear line and at least for right now, between citizen and noncitizens, and their goal is to remove as many noncitizens from the country as possible and to make it as difficult as possible for noncitizens to enter the country,” Godshall-Bennett, Vijandre's attorney, said.

The original winner of the 2025 World's Strongest Woman competition in Arlington, Texas, was stripped of the title after allegations that the athlete is transgender came to light.

Andrea Thompson, the 2018 winner, stepped down from the podium at the event over the weekend after Jammie Booker won the title.

Thompson came in second place by just one point to Booker in the open women's category (no weight requirement). A YouTube video from what appears to be Booker's own channel, dating back to 2017, shows Booker claiming to be "trans."

A video showed Thompson stepping off the podium appearing to say, "This is bulls---."

According to Strongman Archives, Booker had not competed in women's events prior to this past June. It is unclear whether Booker had previously competed as a man.

After backlash over the previous 48 hours, Official Strongman announced that Booker would be "disqualified," admitting it was unaware of allegations that Booker was born male. The ruling now gives Thompson her second victory in the competition.

"Had we been aware, or had this been declared at any point before or during the competition, this athlete would not have been permitted to compete in the Woman's Open category. We are clear - competitors can only compete in the category for the biological sex recorded at birth," Official Strongman said in an announcement Tuesday. "Official Strongman is inclusive and proud to run events which do not discriminate against athletes based on personal characteristics. Any athlete is welcome. But it is our responsibility to ensure fairness and ensure athletes are assigned to men or women's categories based on whether they are recorded as male or female at birth."

Thompson shared a post from her coach, Laurence Shahlaei, congratulating her on "winning" the event. Shahlaei made the post on Monday, one day after the event. Shahlaei told Fox News Digital just prior to Strongman's announcement that he had been told Thompson would be crowned the champion and that an official announcement would be made.

"This win hasn't come without controversy, but I want to make it very clear that while I support and applaud people for being who they want to be, sport is sport and the women's classes exist for a reason," Shahlaei wrote.

Thompson finished third in 2019 and second in 2022 at the same competition. She won the Masters World's Strongest Woman event, reserved for women 40 years or older. 

Booker has competed in three events this year, winning the first back in June and coming in second in the North America's Strongest Woman. On Sept. 14, Booker began a GoFundMe for help get money to compete in the competition.

"After taking 1st in the Rainier Classic regional (and getting my pro card) and 2nd at the North America's Strongest Woman competition, I have qualified for the next level of competition at the Official Strongman Games and I have a good chance of reaching the podium at this event as well," Booker wrote.

"Now comes the difficult task of funding the trip. Registration fees are $285, the flight to Texas will be around $350, and the hotel fees for the 3 day competition and pre competition rules meeting will be $900. I simply cannot afford this on my shoestring planet fitness trainer budget. Winning this competition will open huge doors for my career both as an athlete and as a trainer."

Strongman said it has attempted to reach out to Booker, "but a response has not been received." On Monday, Booker posted a video to Instagram thanking numerous people for their assistance in what was originally a victory.

Booker's TikTok biography reads that Booker, 28, is the "Worlds Strongest Lesbian." In a post from January, Booker wrote, "no im not a man."

Booker's first post on Instagram is a photo posing at a Planet Fitness on July 31, 2022.

Former NFL star Trent Green talks to Fox News Digital about Shedeur Sanders' first start as an NFL pro.

Cleveland Browns legend Bernie Kosar was discharged from a hospital on Monday after a successful liver transplant just a week earlier.

Kosar, who was released a day before his 62nd birthday, said he feels like a "walking miracle."

"There was no way I thought I was going to be here for my 62nd birthday," Kosar said during a press conference on Monday, according to Cleveland.com. "There was no way I thought I was going to be healthy, let alone walking out of here."

"I feel like a walking miracle."

Kosar revealed that he needed a transplant after he was diagnosed with liver failure in July 2024 in an interview with Cleveland Magazine. 

After being put on a transplant list in the spring of 2024, Kosar received a new liver on Nov. 17. It came from 21-year-old Bryce Dunlap, who had died from complications of an anoxic brain injury the day before.

Dunlap, who the family says was a huge Browns and Cleveland sports fan, would be celebrating from heaven that he saved someone's life, according to the family.

"We are so happy for Bernie being released so he can continue to recover in comfort. We truly believe that Bryce is looking down and is so proud that he helped a Browns legend. And that is what is getting us by. Bryce was an amazing boy with the biggest heart," the Dunlap family said in a statement to 3news.com

Upon being told the story of how Kosar got his liver, the Browns' legend became emotional.

"I'm trying not to cry, first. I love him," Kosar told 3News. "Yes, he's looking down on me, and I'm so thankful for that. But he's also within me. I feel him within me. I know that sounds corny or out there; I feel him within me. There's more than me in me now. There's no doubt about that. I just love him and his family. You matter."

Kosar spent 12 seasons in the NFL, nine with the Browns. He was named to his lone Pro Bowl with the Browns but won the Super Bowl with the Dallas Cowboys in 1993. He spent the final three seasons of his career with the Miami Dolphins. 

In 126 games and 108 starts, Kosar had a 53-54-1 record and completed 59.3% of his passes for 23,301 yards, with 124 touchdowns and 87 interceptions.

Live Updates


            • A flurry of economic data released Tuesday after a blackout during the government shutdown paints a confusing picture of the US economy.
    


            • September wholesale inflation rose by 0.3%, keeping the annual level at 2.7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
    


            • Retail sales rose 0.2% in September, but after factoring in the 0.3% increase in prices that month, spending was actually down 0.1%.
    


            • Consumer confidence for November fell to its lowest level since April as Americans expressed concern about what the future holds for their jobs, cost of living and the economy at large.
    


            Data for September retail sales and wholesale inflation landed Tuesday, several weeks delayed by the recent US government shutdown.
    


            But just when – or even if – the following months' retail sales and Producer Price Index reports will be released remains TBD.
    


            The federal statistical agencies are working their way through an unprecedented economic data backlog after the lengthy lapse in appropriations stymied efforts to collect, analyze and release reports for a month and a half.
    


            As it stands now, several crucial economic reports for the month of October – notably the jobs report and the Consumer Price Index – won't be published in their original form. Instead, partial data will be released alongside the November reports.
    


            As of Tuesday midday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics had yet to provide an update as to whether and how the October PPI will be released as well as a rescheduled date for the November report.
    


            The Census Bureau still has a “TBD” pasted by the October release date for retail sales.
    


            When economists and policymakers analyze inflation data, they often look to “core” indexes that strip out the categories of food and energy, which tend to be more volatile.
    


            In the September Producer Price Index, that underlying trend looked fairly tame: Core PPI rose just 0.1% for the month, which brought the annual rate to 2.6%, the lowest since July 2024. This is better than the 0.3% monthly gain and 2.7% annual rate economists were expecting for core, according to FactSet consensus estimates.
    


            PPI doesn't translate directly to the inflation consumers see; however, sharp-rising goods prices – specifically in the areas of gasoline, food and electricity – could be foretelling that those key household purchases could get even pricier than they already are.
    


            Wall Street continued to waver Tuesday after a slew of economic data was released following the end of the government shutdown.
    


            The Dow rose by around 500 points, or 1.08%, by midday. The S&P 500 rose by 0.5% and the Nasdaq pushed higher by 0.12%.
    


            On balance, traders focused on any sign that the latest economic news would boost the chances of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve when policymakers meet in a couple of weeks.
    


            Some Fed officials have in recent days telegraphed their intention to trim rates at the next meeting, invigorating markets. Traders are currently pricing in a chance of more than 80% that the central bank will ease off.
    


            But the tech sector still continued to struggle Tuesday, with AI darling Nvidia falling by around 4% on news that Meta was mulling purchasing chips from Alphabet.
    


            America's economic mood is souring as worries about the labor market mount.
    


            The Conference Board's latest survey of American consumers, released Tuesday, showed that consumer confidence declined sharply this month to a reading of 88.7, the lowest level since April, when President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs.
    


            “Consumers' write-in responses pertaining to factors affecting the economy continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade, and politics, with increased mentions of the federal government shutdown,” Dana Peterson, the Conference Board's chief economist, said in a release. The government shutdown ended earlier this month, so consumer confidence could rebound in December.
    


            The survey also showed growing pessimism among respondents about job availability and income prospects in the next six months.
    


            “Mid-2026 expectations for labor market conditions remained decidedly negative, and expectations for increased household incomes shrunk dramatically, after six months of strongly positive readings,” Peterson said.
    


            There have been high-profile announcements of layoffs in recent weeks, but that doesn't immediately translate into higher unemployment, which was at a low 4.4% rate in September, according to the latest Labor Department data.
    


            Tuesday's PPI data indicated that some firms are shielding their customers from the brunt of the steep and blunt tariffs on imported goods, wrote Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
    


            He noted the trade services category, which tends to be quite volatile, measures profit margins for wholesalers and retailers. So, economists have been watching that category closely as a potential indication for how much businesses might be absorbing some of the tariff costs versus passing them along to consumers.
    


            Trade services in September dipped 0.2%, following a 1.7% drop in August, PPI data showed.
    


            “But the picture differs markedly by sector, with auto retailers accepting substantially lower margins, while most other retailers are passing on all the rise in acquisition prices to consumers,” Tombs wrote.
    


            For consumers, September PPI could mean better news if they're in the market for sneakers or sports equipment, less so if they're wanting to buy a new computer or TV.
    


            In addition to auto dealers, the industries showing some of the biggest hits to their margins (and potentially lower cost increases for the end consumer) included retailers of sporting goods, clothing, shoes and jewelry as well as wholesalers of machinery, paper and plastics, PPI data shows.
    


            Industries with the largest increases in margins (indicating higher costs are potentially being passed on to consumers) were retailers of TVs, video equipment, computers, furniture and flooring – categories where the US is heavily reliant on imports.
    


            US home sales based on contract signings rose in October to the highest level in nearly a year, in a sign that lower mortgage rates are spurring home-buying activity.
    


            Pending home sales rose 1.9% in October from the prior month, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday, bringing the index to its highest level since November 2024. Sales were up across the country except in the West, with the Midwest seeing a robust 5.3% monthly increase.
    


            “The Midwest shined above other regions due to better affordability, while contract signings retreated in the more expensive West region,” Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said in a release. “Days on the market typically lengthen from November through February, providing better negotiating power to buyers during the holiday season.”
    


            It typically takes about a month or two for a home sale to close after an offer was accepted. Mortgage rates have been steadily declining since May, with the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage reaching this year's lowest point in late October. Mortgage rates have increased slightly since.
    


            US home prices increased in September at the weakest pace since mid-2023 as affordability challenges in major markets across the country kept buyers on the sidelines.
    


            The S&P Cotality Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index rose 1.3% in September, S&P Global said Tuesday, slightly down from August's 1.4% gain.
    


            The index has been steadily weakening since 2022, when the Federal Reserve began to hike interest rates to tamp down inflation. The central bank is now lowering borrowing costs, with its benchmark lending rate at its lowest point in three years.
    


            “National home prices continued trailing inflation, with September's (Consumer Price Index) running 1.7 percentage points ahead of housing appreciation,” Nicholas Godec, head of fixed income tradables & commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in a release. “This marks the widest gap between inflation and home-price growth since the two measures diverged in June, with the spread continuing to widen each month.”
    


            Chicago, New York and Boston saw the strongest price gains in September, while home prices in Tampa, Phoenix, Dallas and Miami declined that month.
    


            “Markets that were pandemic darlings — particularly in Florida, Arizona, and Texas — are now experiencing outright price declines,” Godec said. “Meanwhile, traditionally stable metros in the Northeast and Midwest continue to post solid gains, suggesting a reversion to pre-pandemic patterns where job markets and urban fundamentals drive appreciation rather than migration trends and remote-work dynamics.”
    


            Wall Street started the day on a fairly quiet note as investors digested a batch of long-delayed economic data.
    


            Within minutes of the opening bell the Dow was already up by close to 270 points, or 0.5%. The broader S&P 500 hovered in and out of the red. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3%.
    


            Stocks are coming off two days of strong gains as hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts have boosted markets. However, the S&P 500 and Dow are still on track for their first losing month since April. The Nasdaq is set for its first losing month since March.
    


            Investors were keen to see how aspects of the economy – like retail sales – fared in recent months. Investors have embraced hopes for Fed rate cuts after recent comments from central bank officials suggested a cut could be on the table.
    


            Treasury yields ticker lower Tuesday morning as investors leaned in to bets that the Fed will cut rates in December.
    


            Gold futures rose 1.3%. Gold prices can rise when the Fed is expected to lower rates.
    


            Wholesale goods prices leapt 0.9% in September – the sharpest monthly increase for the category in more than 18 months – and were the driver behind the overall September gain in the Producer Price Index, the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed Tuesday.
    


            Wholesale services prices were flat for the month.
    


            Energy prices, particularly sharp-rising gas prices, accounted for about two-thirds of that goods index monthly increase. Within goods, categories such as meats, residential electric power and motor vehicles also moved higher.
    


            When taking energy out of the equation, as well as food, the underlying goods inflation trend perhaps shows a silver lining:
    


            “Core goods price gains slowed to 0.2% after a couple of larger pops, suggesting tariff pressure might be ebbing,” Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO, wrote Tuesday in a note to investors.
    


            The delayed data for September's Producer Price Index showed that core inflation is “moving away from the Fed's 2% target rate,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, in a note Tuesday.
    


            “There is not no inflation and it is higher than the 2.1% year-on-year rate for core factory goods when the president took office in January,” he wrote.
    


            Headline inflation mostly remained close to expectations.
    


            The federal government on Tuesday released key economic reports on inflation and spending, but the numbers likely did little to sway the heated debate among Federal Reserve policymakers.
    


            Central bankers are split on whether they should lower interest rates again at their upcoming meeting in December. They've lowered rates twice this year, in September and October, each time by a quarter point, bringing their key interest rate to its lowest level in three years.
    


            One side — mostly members of the Fed's Board of Governors — argues that the Fed should continue lowering rates to preserve the labor market's health, while the other camp believes that officials should hold rates steady and get the job done on inflation, considering that it has remained above their 2% target for more than four years.
    


            The latest data didn't offer any clear indication that the economy urgently needs any relief from the Fed — nor that price pressures are getting out of control. The numbers, delayed by the government shutdown, are also dated.
    


            Retail spending in September was on the weaker side, but it remained in positive territory. And inflation at the wholesale level that month came in mostly as economists had expected.
    


            Sales at US retailers increased in September for the fourth consecutive month, boosted by low unemployment and a buoyant stock market.
    


            Retail sales, which account for about a third of overall spending, rose 0.2% in September, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That was a much slower pace than August's 0.6% gain.
    


            But after factoring in the 0.3% increase in prices that month, according to the Consumer Price Index for September, retail spending edged down 0.1%.
    


             Spending was up across half of categories in September, increasing the most at so-called miscellaneous retailers by a solid 2.9%. Sales also increased at restaurants and bars, rising 0.7%. Meanwhile, sales were down at car dealerships, clothing stores, electronics retailers, department stores and online.
    


            The report was originally due on October 16, but it was delayed because of the government shutdown.
    


            The figures show that consumer spending, the lifeblood of the US economy, was somewhat weak heading into the current quarter, which stretches from October through December. In September, employers added jobs at a robust pace and unemployment ticked up but remained low.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in a biting rebuke of the Federal Reserve, said members of the central bank should quit commenting publicly about the potential direction of rate-setting policy and focus instead on listening to Americans who are struggling with high borrowing rates.
    


            “It's time for the Fed to move back into the background like it used to, calm things down, work for the American people, [and] set monetary policy on a good course,” Bessent said in an interview with CNBC Tuesday morning. “This isn't sport; it's people's lives. We just need to calm down all these speeches by these bank presidents that are redundant.”
    


            Markets have moved – sometimes dramatically – in recent days after Fed governors and regional bank presidents commented on potential monetary policy decisions.
    


            But Bessent said he believes the Fed should lower rates in December, arguing that the government shutdown hurt the economy.
    


            “We know the economy hasn't gotten better,” he said. “I'm not even sure what the discussion is here.”
    


            US wholesale inflation picked up speed in September, an indication that prices could soon heat up even more for consumers.
    


            The shutdown-delayed Producer Price Index for September showed that prices increased 0.3% on a monthly basis, keeping the annual inflation rate at 2.7%. In August, wholesale prices fell 0.1% on a monthly basis, largely because of compressed profit margins.
    


            August's annual increase, which was initially estimated at 2.6%, was upwardly revised to 2.7%.
    


            Economists were expecting that producer prices rose 0.3% from August and was 2.6% for the 12 months ended in September.
    


            Black Friday through Christmas will test America's economic strength. Preliminary reports look good: Early-bird holiday shoppers have been out in strong numbers this year, according to a report earlier this month from Bank of America.
    


            High-income consumers keep spending like they've never heard of this affordability crisis people keep talking about.
    


            Middle- and lower-income folks, despite declaring that they're fed up with their financial situations, are also still spending, in aggregate.
    


            But Americans are all spending more in part because prices are higher. Stubborn inflation, combined with already-high prices, has forced people to shell out more for the holidays, pushing spending numbers up.
    


            It's one reason a poll published by Fox News this week showed 76% of Americans have a negative view of this economy, up from 67% in July.
    


            Read more here.
    


            Something in the US economy isn't adding up, and it's rattling the people charged with wrangling inflation and keeping the labor market intact.
    


            US companies have sharply slowed their hiring this year, hesitant to invest without knowing the full effects of President Donald Trump's sweeping economic policies. The economy lost jobs in June and August, and the average pace of job gains for the three months ending in September was only around 62,000, according to the Labor Department.
    


            Yet workers' productivity, a key driver of economic output, remains high. And gross domestic product, which captures all the goods and services produced in the economy, has stayed robust.
    


            That dichotomy of an expanding economy and a softening labor market presents a conundrum for policymakers at the Federal Reserve, complicating their efforts to determine whether the economy needs cooling or boosting.
    


            A growing economy, boosted by resilient consumers and massive investments in AI, should be spurring hiring, especially now that the Fed has started lowering borrowing costs.
    


            But that hasn't happened — and there are fears it won't.
    


            Read more here.
    


            President Donald Trump and his economic team often respond to concerns about the affordability crisis by touting how much cheaper gasoline is than under his predecessor.
    


            For the vast majority of 2025, this was a legitimate bragging point for the White House.
    


            Until now.
    


            For the first time since the start of Trump's second term, the discount between this year's prices and last year's has effectively disappeared.
    


            The national average for regular gas stood at $3.055 on Tuesday, almost exactly the same as $3.056 a year ago under former President Joe Biden, according to AAA.
    


            In fact, Tuesday breaks an eight-day streak where the national average was up on a year-over-year basis, according to AAA data shared with CNN.
    


            It's a big shift from earlier this year, when gas was 30, 40 and even 50 cents cheaper than the same point in 2024.

            US stock futures were lower Tuesday morning as investors awaited a slew of economic data.
    


            Dow futures fell 34 points, or 0.07%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.04%. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.11%.
    


            Stocks are coming off two days in the green. The tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 2.69% on Monday, posting its best day since May.
    


            Wall Street is trying to discern whether the Federal Reserve will lower its benchmark interest rate at its policy meeting in December.  Traders on Tuesday morning were pricing in an 81% chance that the Fed cuts rates, according to CME FedWatch.
    


            New York Fed President John Williams and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly in recent days have suggested they could support a rate cut in December, which helped send stocks higher on Friday and Monday.
    


            Stock investors like lower interest rates because it encourages spending and business activity, boosting corporate profits, while lowering bond yields, making stocks relatively more appealing.
    


            “During this holiday-shortened week, investors will receive a cornucopia of data now that the government is open again,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said in a note. “Some of the data will be a bit stale. But they should indicate how [the third quarter] ended for the economy.”
    


CNN's Fear and Greed Index hovered in “extreme fear.”
    


            Next up in the pipeline of shutdown-delayed economic reports is the September iteration of the Producer Price Index.
    


            This closely watched report provides a gauge on inflation at the wholesale level: It lays out the average change in the selling prices that producers receive for their goods and services. While PPI doesn't directly translate to the Consumer Price Index, it's viewed as a potential bellwether for the prices consumers may see in the months ahead.
    


            That's where things get interesting with this seemingly old-news report: The trajectory of the pricing trends in Tuesday's report could provide a window into the price increases consumers are seeing currently and into the near future.
    


            That could be especially salient considering the October CPI has been drastically marred as the shutdown hampered data-collection efforts.
    


            Economists expect that producer prices likely rose 0.3% in September, which would be an acceleration from the preliminary 0.1% drop reported for August, a decline that was driven by compressed profit margins. The annual rate is expected to hold at 2.6%.
    


            While the federal government is starting to release delayed economic data following the record-breaking shutdown, it's becoming increasingly apparent that a lot of the data covering last month won't be published in its usual form.
    


            That's because the shutdown prevented government statistical agencies from collecting all the necessary information to produce various reports.
    


            As a result, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced last week it will only be publishing limited October price data as opposed to the complete data included in monthly Consumer Price Index reports.
    


            The agency also said it won't be publishing an October jobs report. Rather, some of the data that would otherwise make it into that report will be included in the November report scheduled for December 16.

PARIS (AP) — The Paris prosecutor announced four more arrests Tuesday in connection with the stunning heist at the Louvre Museum in October by a gang that made off with $102 million worth of jewels.

The two men and two women taken into custody are from the Paris region and range in age from 31 to 40, said the prosecutor, Laure Beccuau, whose office is heading the investigation.

Her statement didn't say what role they're suspected of having played in the Oct. 19 theft. Police can hold them for questioning for 96 hours.







French media report that one of those arrested, a 39-year-old already known to police services, is believed to be the fourth member of the team thought to have carried out the daring daylight robbery and is from Aubervilliers, a suburb north of Paris other suspects have connections with. 

The other three alleged members of the so-called “commando” team have been previously arrested and face preliminary charges of theft by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy. Their DNA has been found on the scene or on items linked to the robbery. 

A woman arrested in October is accused of complicity. 

The loot hasn't been recovered. It includes a diamond-and-emerald necklace Napoleon gave to Empress Marie-Louise, jewels tied to 19th-century Queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense, and Empress Eugénie's pearl-and-diamond tiara.

The robbery has focused attention on security at the Louvre, the world's most-visited museum. 




The thieves took less than eight minutes to force their way into the museum and leave, using a freight lift to reach the building's window. Footage from museum cameras showed two broke into the ornate Apollo Gallery, cutting into the jewelry display cases with disc cutters and making off with the trove, while two riders on scooters whisked them away.

The emerald-set imperial crown of Napoleon III's wife, Empress Eugénie, containing more than 1,300 diamonds, was later found outside the museum.

Russia launched a wave of attacks on Ukraine's capital Kyiv early Tuesday, striking residential buildings and energy infrastructure, according to video footage and local authorities.

The calls for a peace deal came as Russia launched a wave of attacks on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, overnight, with at least seven people killed in strikes that hit city buildings and energy infrastructure. A Ukrainian attack on southern Russia killed three people and damaged homes, authorities said.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A renewed U.S. push to end the war between Russia and Ukraine is gathering momentum, although some of the key issues remain unresolved, officials said Tuesday.

The update was issued hours after Russia launched a wave of overnight attacks on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, with at least seven people killed in strikes that hit city buildings and energy infrastructure. A Ukrainian attack on southern Russia killed three people and damaged homes, authorities said.

“Over the past week, the United States has made tremendous progress towards a peace deal by bringing both Ukraine and Russia to the table,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X.

“There are a few delicate, but not insurmountable, details that must be sorted out and will require further talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the United States.”

President Donald Trump's plan for ending the nearly four-year war emerged last week. It heavily favored Russia, prompting Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to quickly engage with American negotiators. European leaders, fearing for their own future amid Russian aggression but apparently sidelined by Trump in drawing up the proposals, scrambled to steer the negotiations toward accommodating their concerns.

Senior U.S. and Ukrainian officials said progress was made at talks in Geneva held on Sunday toward ending the war.




French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday peace efforts are gathering momentum and “are clearly at a crucial juncture.”

“Negotiations are getting a new impetus. And we should seize this momentum,” he said during at a video conference meeting of countries, led by France and the U.K., that could help police any ceasefire with Russia.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said of the talks: “I do think we are moving in a positive direction and indications today that in large part the majority of the text, (Zelenskyy) is indicating, can be accepted.”

U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll met with Russian officials for several hours in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on Tuesday, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. 

Driscoll, who became part of the American negotiating team less than two weeks ago, is heading up the latest phase of talks involving the terms of a possible peace settlement with Russia.

The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, declined to give details on how long the negotiations would last or what topics were being discussed, but noted that the Ukrainians were aware of the meeting and all sides have indicated they wanted to reach a deal to halt the fighting as quickly as possible.

Oleksandr Bevz, one of the Ukrainian delegates at the Geneva talks, said that the numbers of points in the proposed settlement was reduced, but he denied reports that the 28-point U.S. peace plan now consisted of 19 points.

”(The document) is going to continue to change. We can confirm that it was reduced to take out points not relating to Ukraine, to exclude duplicates and for editing purposes,” Bevz told the AP, adding that some points relating solely to relations between Russia and the U.S. were excluded.

Zelenskyy said late Monday that “the list of necessary steps to end the war can become workable,”He said that he planned to discuss “sensitive” outstanding issues with Trump. 

Rustem Umerov, a senior adviser to Zelenskyy, posted on X on Tuesday that Zelenskyy hoped to finalize a deal with Trump “at the earliest suitable date in November.” 

Russian officials have been reserved in their comments on the peace plan. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday that Moscow is in touch with U.S. officials about peace efforts.

“We expect them to provide us with a version they consider an interim one in terms of completing the phase of coordinating this text with the Europeans and the Ukrainians,” Lavrov said.

European leaders have cautioned that the road to peace will be long.

Russia fired 22 missiles of various types and more than 460 drones at Ukraine overnight, Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram. The strikes knocked out water, electricity and heat in parts of Kyiv. Images showed a large fire spreading in a nine-story residential building in Kyiv's eastern Dniprovskyi district.

Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said 20 people were wounded in Kyiv. The Russian Defense Ministry said that it targeted military-industrial facilities and energy assets. The strikes were a response to Ukrainian attacks on civilian objects in Russia, the ministry said.

Liubov Petrivna, a 90-year-old resident of a damaged building in the Dniprovskyi district, told the AP that “absolutely everything” in her apartment was shattered by the strike and “glass rained down” on her. 

Petrivna said that she didn't believe in the peace plan now under discussion. 

“No one will ever do anything about it,” she said. Russian President Vladimir Putin “won't stop until he finishes us off.”

The overnight Ukrainian drone attack on Russia's southern region of Krasnodar was “one of the longest and most massive” and wounded six people, Gov. Veniamin Kondratyev said. 

Russian air defenses destroyed 249 Ukrainian drones overnight above various Russian regions and the occupied Crimean Peninsula, the Russian Defense Ministry said Tuesday.

Ukraine said that its drones and missiles struck an aviation repair plant and a drone production facility, as well as an oil refinery and an oil terminal.

It was the fourth-largest Ukrainian drone attack on Russia since the start of the war on Feb. 24, 2022, according to an AP tally.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — U.S. Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia has agreed to pay nearly $5.2 million in overdue personal taxes, the latest saga for the former billionaire who has been followed by a trail of financial challenges going back well over a decade.

An attorney for Justice and his wife, Cathy, entered into a joint motion for consent judgment with the federal government Monday, the same day that the government filed a lawsuit saying that the couple “have neglected or refused to make full payment” for the income taxes dating to 2009. An attorney for the U.S. Justice Department's tax division signed off on the agreement. 

Justice had a fortune estimated at $1.9 billion last decade by Forbes magazine, which stripped his billionaire title in 2021, when Justice's worth had dwindled to an estimated $513 million. Earlier this year, Forbes estimated that Justice's net worth had disintegrated to “less than zero” due to liabilities that far exceeded assets.

A spokesperson for Justice's office didn't immediate respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday.

During a briefing with local media in October, Justice asserted that his companies “are complicated and complex” and that his children “are doing a magnificent job” running them. He then repeated past assertions that collection efforts against him were politically motivated, before concluding:. “At the end of the day, I'd say just let it be and see how it all plays out.”

Justice, a former two-term Republican governor who owns dozens of businesses that include coal and agricultural operations, was elected last November to the Senate. He took over the seat vacated by the retiring Joe Manchin, a Democrat who became an independent in 2024 near the end of his second full term.




Justice still has other financial challenges to work out. 

The Internal Revenue Service last month filed liens totaling more than $8 million against Justice and his wife on unpaid personal taxes. In September, state tax officials filed $1.4 million in liens against the Justice family's historic hotel, The Greenbrier, and the resort's Greenbrier Sporting Club, over unpaid sales taxes.

Last month, a foreclosure auction on several hundred lots owned by the Justice family at a resort community near Beckley was paused. The auction centered on a dispute between the Glade Springs Village Property Owners Association and Justice Holdings over unpaid fees. The state Supreme Court plans to review the case more closely.

In 2021, the IRS filed liens over $1.1 million in unpaid taxes on the Greenbrier Hotel and an additional $80,000 on the resort's medical clinic. Those debts were paid off later that year. 

Justice's family settled debts last year in a separate case to avoid the Greenbrier Hotel's foreclosure. The 710-room hotel, which has hosted U.S. presidents, royalty and congressional retreats, had come under threat of being auctioned off on the steps of a Lewisburg courthouse. That was after JPMorgan Chase sold a longstanding loan taken out by Justice to a credit collection company, Beltway Capital, which declared it to be in default. 

The state Democratic Party has said efforts to seize the hotel from Justice were “a direct consequence of his own financial incompetence.”

Last year, a union official at the Greenbrier said that Justice's family was at least $2.4 million behind in payments to an employees' health insurance fund, putting workers' coverage at risk. In 2023, dozens of properties owned by the Justice family in three counties were auctioned as payment for delinquent real estate taxes. Others have sought to recoup millions in fines for environmental issues and unsafe working conditions at his company's coal mines.

Justice bought The Greenbrier resort out of bankruptcy in 2009 for $20.1 million. The sporting club is a private equity club and residential community on the property that opened in 2000.

The resort in White Sulphur Springs that dates to 1778 also has a casino, spa and dozens of amenities and employs around 2,000 workers. The resort held a PGA Tour golf tournament from 2010 until 2019 and has welcomed NFL teams for training camp and practices. A once-secret 112,000-square-foot (10,080-square-meter) underground bunker built for Congress at the Greenbrier in case of nuclear attack during the Cold War now hosts tours.

Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson shares more surrounding the Venezuelan airspace warning on ‘Special Report.' 

In one corner of the world, the U.S. is trying to end a war. In another, it may be preparing to start one.

While Washington pushes proposals aimed at easing Russia's terms for a cease-fire with Ukraine in Europe, it's taking a far tougher stance in the Western Hemisphere — moving to label Venezuela's military-linked Cartel de los Soles a terrorist organization and quietly expanding its military footprint in the Caribbean.

Sporadic strikes on alleged cartel boats off Venezuela's coast have grown into the largest U.S. military presence in Southern Command's area in a generation, with the world's biggest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, steaming toward the Caribbean Sea. President Donald Trump has reportedly approved CIA covert measures inside Venezuela — operations that often precede military force — and U.S. planners have already drawn up target lists for cartel sites, according to The New York Times.

Many believe the U.S. could soon launch direct strikes on Venezuelan territory aimed at pushing Nicolás Maduro out of power. 

TRUMP'S STRIKE ON CARTEL VESSEL OFF VENEZUELA SENDS WARNING TO MADURO: ‘NO SANCTUARY'

At the same time, a top Russian commander, Colonel General Oleg Makarevich, has been reassigned from the Ukrainian front to head Russia's Equator Task Force in Venezuela, overseeing roughly 120 troops training Venezuelan forces, Ukrainian intelligence chief Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov told The War Zone. Fox News Digital has not independently verified Budanov's claim.

Seth Krummrich, a retired U.S. Army colonel and vice president at Global Guardian, said Russian military advisers are indeed operating inside Venezuela but doubted Moscow would back Maduro militarily. "They're there, full stop," Krummrich said. "But Russia needs to stop the massive blood-letting of its young men in Ukraine. They're not going to go toe-to-toe with us militarily." He added that the relationship is long-standing: "There is a long history of Russian military advisers in Cuba and in Venezuela that goes on for decades."

Many in Washington see a strategic payoff in forcing out Maduro: it would strip Russia of its last firm foothold in the Western Hemisphere — a loss comparable, in some analysts' view, to Moscow's waning influence in Syria. "Venezuela, for the longest time, has been a launch pad for Chinese, Russian, and Iranian influence in the Western Hemisphere," Krummrich said. "These chess pieces are all tied together when you arch your great-power competition."

Other experts caution against assuming the U.S. escalation in Venezuela and its peace overtures in Europe are part of a single coordinated plan. Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), spoke with Fox News Digital and said any overlap may be more coincidence than strategy.

"We've been zigging and zagging in Venezuela," Berg said. "Trump has gone back and forth between build-ups and calls for dialogue, while the Russia timeline has only recently become parallel to these events. Anything that looks coordinated is likely coincidence."

Berg recalled that during Trump's first administration, some advisers floated an "Ukraine-for-Venezuela" concept — asking Russia to relinquish its stake in Caracas in exchange for U.S. concessions in Eastern Europe — but the idea was quickly abandoned. "Russian power in Venezuela is important," Berg said, "but it's not so overwhelming that it's the reason Maduro survives."

HOW TRUMP'S STRIKES AGAINST ALLEGED NARCO-TERRORISTS ARE RESHAPING THE CARTEL BATTLEFIELD: 'ONE-WAY TICKET'

Russia's footprint in Latin America has grown only modestly since the early 2000s, dwarfed by China's economic expansion. Moscow's closest partners remain Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. Beyond them, its influence is exercised mainly through media and selective economic pressure.

"If you look at Russia's trade profile with the region, it's small," Berg said. "But Moscow is very good at using those few trade points for leverage."

Russia continues to service aging equipment across the region. "They sell a lot of kit here," Berg added. "Many countries still operate Russian-origin systems that need maintenance and parts. That creates dependency." (Vyacheslav Prokofyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)

He cited examples: when Ecuador considered sending old Russian-made equipment to Ukraine in exchange for U.S. military aid, Russia threatened to block Ecuadorian banana exports — nearly $1 billion annually — by imposing new phytosanitary checks. The deal collapsed within a week.

Similarly, Moscow has kept Brazil and Argentina largely muted on the Ukraine invasion by leveraging its control over nitrate fertilizer exports, crucial to both agricultural giants. "They use whatever levers they have — bananas, fertilizer, spare parts — to coerce quietly," Berg said.

Russia also continues to service aging equipment across the region. "They sell a lot of kit here," Berg added. "Many countries still operate Russian-origin systems that need maintenance and parts. That creates dependency."

If U.S. forces strike Venezuelan targets, most observers expect Russia to limit its response to intelligence sharing and disinformation, not combat support. "The Russians are pretty tied down in Ukraine," Berg said. "We saw during the 12-day war, when Iran appealed for help, Moscow stayed silent. They simply don't have the capacity."

Berg described a recent episode in which a sanctioned Ilyushin cargo plane landed in Caracas. Russian lawmakers briefly claimed it carried air-defense systems and technicians to assist Maduro, but Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov later denied it. "He essentially said, ‘We have no mutual-defense treaty,'" Berg noted. "That was widely read as: we're not coming to Venezuela."

John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, also spoke with Fox News Digital and said there is little evidence of a coordinated link between the U.S. buildup in the Caribbean and Washington's peace overtures in Europe. "I don't see any immediate connection," Hardie said. "Russia's ability to influence events in Venezuela is pretty limited."

He said Moscow's power-projection capacity in the Western Hemisphere remains constrained. "They can take limited action — fly some bombers into the region, sail submarines to Cuba — but major operations in Latin America are beyond their capacity," Hardie said.

Hardie also noted reports of the Russian Ilyushin transport aircraft visiting Venezuela and suggestions it could have carried air-defense systems, but said any such transfer would have little strategic effect. "Even if Russia slipped in some air defenses, it wouldn't make much difference," he said. "The Venezuelan military would still be heavily overmatched by the United States."

Both Krummrich and Berg agree that momentum is building toward U.S. kinetic action. Berg said indications point to possible strikes between Thanksgiving and Christmas, as U.S. naval and intelligence assets align and Trump signals impatience with Maduro's attempts to stall.

"Maduro's instinct is to buy time — that's what's kept him afloat through multiple administrations," Berg said. "But Trump wants results, not a two-year transition or vague promises about U.S. oil access. The question is what Maduro can offer that will actually satisfy him."

Whether this two-track moment represents coincidence or coordination, the stakes are high. A peace framework in Europe could stabilize one front while a new flashpoint ignites closer to home — underscoring the paradox of Washington's posture in late 2025: seeking de-escalation abroad while bracing for confrontation in its own hemisphere.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., weighs in on Hamas, the government shutdown and more on 'Hannity.'

The remains of an Israeli hostage have been transferred to Red Cross custody and will soon be turned over to the Israel Defense Forces in the Gaza Strip, the IDF announced Tuesday.

"The Red Cross is on its way to the meeting point in the central Gaza Strip, where a coffin of a deceased hostage will be transferred into its custody," the IDF said in a statement.

"The IDF requests that the public act with sensitivity and wait for the official identification, which will first be provided to the families," the statement continued.

"Hamas is required to uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the deceased hostages," the IDF noted.

It is still unknown whose remains Israel will be receiving. Prior to Tuesday, there were three deceased hostages known to still be in Hamas custody: Ran Gvili, 24, Dror Or, 48, and Sudthisak Rinthalak, 43.

Gvili served in an elite police unit and was recovering from a motorcycle injury on Oct. 7, 2023. He nevertheless rushed to respond to the attack and helped people escape from the Nova music festival. He was later killed fighting at another location and his body was taken to Gaza.

Or was a father of three who was killed along with his wife, Yonat Or, while protecting two of their children on Oct. 7. The two children, Noam, who was then 16, and Alma, then 13, were abducted and then released during the November 2023 ceasefire.

Rinthalak was a Thai worker employed at a kibbutz that came under attack on Oct. 7. He is one of 31 Thai workers who were kidnapped on Oct. 7. The Thai government says at least 46 of its citizens were killed during the course of the war in Gaza.

The latest release comes less than a week after President Donald Trump met with 17 surviving Israeli hostages and their loved ones at the White House.

Trump gave each of the 17 survivors a Presidential Challenge Coin.

"You're not a hostage anymore, today you're heroes," Trump said. "We love you all, and our country loves you all. You're amazing people."

Kai Trump, the granddaughter of President Donald Trump, says she "100%" wants to be a professional golfer after her time playing at Miami in college.

Kai Trump's LPGA debut did not go exactly as she planned.

The 18-year-old high school senior shot a first-round 83 at The ANNIKA at Pelican Golf Club in Belleair, Florida, putting her in last place out of 108 players through one round. The next day, she bounced back with a five-over 75, but it wasn't enough to make the cut.

It was invaluable experience for Trump, who will play college golf at the University of Miami next year.

Bryson DeChambeau , who shared a hug with the president's granddaughter at the Ryder Cup, was impressed with Trump's showing.

"She shot five-over the second round, which is really, it's actually really impressive. We didn't know how she was going to do, she handled herself very well, and what a great opportunity," DeChambeau told Fox News Digital in a recent interview.

"I was talking to [tournament host] Annika [Sorenstam]. She's a part of the council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition, and we were just talking about how, you know, ‘What do you think about it?' We were both talking, and this is a great opportunity. She's like, 'There's plenty of others that have gotten invites that didn't do well, but it was a great experience for them. And I think it's going to be a great experience for her.'

"It was awesome to see her go out there and compete doing what she loves doing, and she's getting better," DeChambeau added. "We'll see what the story has for her, but she's a grinder and a competitor, and it's fun to see her out there competing with some of the best in the world, even though there's a long way to go, but she is a grinder. You never know."

After finishing her second round, Trump said she felt more "peaceful" compared to the first, which led to the improvement.

"For the first day I was definitely really nervous. I think the nerves just got to me," she said. "When I went out there today, I felt very calm and peaceful, to be honest with you. That's why I played better. I did everything I could possibly have done for this tournament. So, I think if you prepare right, the nerves can … they're always going to be there, right? They can be a little softened. So, I would just say that."

Trump officially committed to the Hurricanes earlier this month.

Cincinnati Bearcats fans were heard making a derogatory chant toward BYU Cougars players during their matchup on Saturday and the school's athletic director has issued an apology.

Cincinnati fans were heard yelling, "F--- the Mormons," as the Cougars picked up their 10th win of the season in a 26-14 effort. BYU is the flagship school for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and is located in Provo, Utah.

"The use of offensive or religiously derogatory language by a group of fans during Saturday's game was unacceptable and does not reflect our values," Cincinnati athletic director John Cunningham wrote in a post on social media. "We remain committed to creating an environment at Nippert Stadium where every visiting team and its supporters are treated with dignity and respect."

The chants occurred a day after The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints delivered a truckload of 27,000 pounds of food to the University of Cincinnati's campus pantry. The pantry provides students, staff and faculty with assistance for food insecurity.

College football fans have been seen directing the foul chant at BYU players this season and in recent years. In September 2022, an Oregon high school recruit left a game early because of the chant during a Ducks and Cougars game.

More recently, Colorado Buffaloes fans were heard yelling the same remarks during a game in Boulder this season. Coach Deion Sanders issued an apology shortly before the Big 12 Conference fined the school $50,000.

It's unclear if Cincinnati will receive the same punishment.

Team USA women's basketball revealed the roster for its training camp on Monday, which will take place on Dec. 12-14 in Durham, North Carolina.

The roster included Lauren Betts, Aliyah Boston, Cameron Brink, Paige Bueckers, Veronica Burton, Sonia Citron, Caitlin Clark, Kahleah Copper, Chelsea Gray, Brittney Griner, Dearica Hamby, Kiki Iriafen, Rickea Jackson, Brionna Jones, Kelsey Plum, Angel Reese, JuJu Watkins and Jackie Young.

The graphic that came along with the announcement featured Copper, Plum and Young. Those three players were on the U.S. team when they won gold at the Paris Olympics.

Women's basketball fans were quick to question why Clark was left off the graphic for promotional material given that she's among the most popular players in women's basketball.

Columnist Christine Brennan, who wrote a book about Clark, was among those to question USA Basketball's decision.

Clark didn't play for the U.S. team during the Olympics, which was also a source of consternation among fans. She has a gold medal playing for the U.S. in junior competitions before she turned pro and was drafted by the Indiana Fever.

She also missed a ton of time in her second WNBA season due to injuries.

Former FBI Director James Comey hailed the federal judge who dismissed the federal indictment against him on Monday, saying the case against him was based on "malevolence and incompetence."

Former FBI Director James Comey hailed the federal judge who dismissed the federal indictment against him on Monday, saying the case against him was based on "malevolence and incompetence."

Judge Cameron Currie dismissed the false statements charges against Comey in a Monday ruling, finding that they were brought by an unqualified U.S. attorney. President Donald Trump's administration maintains that the attorney, Lindsay Halligan, was legally appointed and has indicated they plan to pursue further legal action.

"I'm grateful that the court ended the case against me, which was a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence, and a reflection of what the Department of Justice has become under Donald Trump, which is heartbreaking," Comey said, before thanking the lawyers who represented him in the case.

"This case mattered to me personally, obviously, but it matters most because a message has to be sent. That the president of the United States cannot use the Department of Justice to target his political enemies. I don't care what your politics are. You have to see that as fundamentally un-American and a threat to the rule of law that keeps all of us free," he continued.

FEDERAL JUDGE CALLS COMEY INDICTMENT INTO QUESTION, ASKS IF HALLIGAN IS A 'PUPPET' FOR TRUMP

Comey went on to say that he expects the Trump administration to continue coming after him despite the legal setback. He called on Americans to "stand up" against the "fools who would frighten us," suggesting Trump is a "would-be tyrant."

Currie's ruling also threw out the DOJ's case against New York Attorney General Letitia James, citing the same reason.

"I conclude that the Attorney General's attempt to install Ms. [Lindsey] Halligan as Interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was invalid and that Ms. Halligan has been unlawfully serving in that role since September 22, 2025," Currie wrote.

JAMES COMEY SEEKS TO DISMISS HIS CRIMINAL CASE, CITING 'VINDICTIVE' PROSECUTION

Currie, a Clinton appointee based in South Carolina, was brought in from out of state to preside over proceedings about the question of Halligan's authority because it presented a conflict for the Virginia judges. Comey's and James' challenges to Halligan's appointment were consolidated because of their similarity.

Halligan acted alone in presenting charges to the grand juries shortly after Trump ousted the prior interim U.S. attorney, Erik Siebert, and urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to replace him with Halligan, a former White House aide and insurance lawyer. Bondi complied, but Currie found the interim U.S. attorney term had already expired under Siebert and that the Virginia judges were now responsible for appointing a temporary U.S. attorney to serve until Trump could get one confirmed in the Senate.

Trump has been unable to persuade the Senate to confirm several U.S. attorneys in blue states, leading the president and Bondi to sidestep the upper chamber at times to install Trump's preferred appointees, such as Halligan. Currie's decision comes after federal judges also disqualified appointees in California, New Jersey and Nevada.

By 



In an unusual diplomatic move, Chinese leader Xi Jinping initiated a phone call with President Trump on Monday to discuss Taiwan, a flashpoint that has surged to the forefront in recent days as Japan takes a more assertive stance on the island's autonomy.

While Taiwan was Xi's focus, Trump steered the conversation to Ukraine, said people familiar with the matter, as Washington-Kyiv peace talks appear to make progress and Trump tries to decisively end Russia's war in Ukraine.

Why has Jensen Huang, co-founder of Nvidia, the hardware of the AI boom, buddied up with Trump?

The biggest company in the world is Nvidia, and it's been making the same product since 1993: a specialized computer chip called a GPU, or a graphics processing unit. Those chips do all the fancy, complicated math needed to display images, videos, and 3D graphics onto our screens.

Back in the day, if you wanted to play “state-of-the-art” PC games like Unreal, Quake, or Half-Life, you likely bought one of Nvidia's GPUs (more commonly called graphics cards at the time).

“If you were a really serious gamer back in like 1998, you would be building your own high powered PC at home. You'd be up to your ears in circuit boards and soldering equipment,” Robbie Wheland, a tech and business reporter for The Wall Street Journal told Today, Explained co-host Noel King. “And you'd be buying one of Nvidia's graphics cards, and putting that into your awesome high powered gaming computer that you would play on the internet.”

Today, though, Nvidia's product isn't so niche. Their chips are more advanced, and they are now the hardware powering the artificial intelligence boom. “Think ChatGPT, Gemini, NotebookLM, or Claude,” Wheland said.

Because Nvidia is now essential to the tech sector, that has made the company very important to the well-being of the entire American economy; the stock market can swing on whether Nvidia releases a good earnings report or a bad one.

The company, and its founder Jensen Huang, have also become powerful players within American politics, foreign relations, and international diplomacy. Wheland broke down the story behind the company's rise, its business dealings, and the founder's friendship with President Donald Trump on Today, Explained.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Tell me about Jensen Huang, the man behind Nvidia. 

Jensen Huang is the co-founder and chief executive of Nvidia. He was born in Taiwan, which has really become the intellectual epicenter of the AI boom. And he moved to the US when he was a child.

Today, he's not only just the CEO of the largest company on Planet Earth, he's also an incredibly influential and powerful person in foreign relations, in international diplomacy. He's a very good friend of President Donald Trump. And I think it's not a stretch to say he's one of the most important individual people on Earth right now, just given how much power and how much economic might he oversees.

If you go back to Trump's inauguration, and you think about who was with him that day, many of them were tech CEOs, but Jensen Huang was not among them. Why wasn't he there? 

My understanding is that Donald Trump maybe didn't even know who Jensen was in January.

He knew this was a guy who was a tech CEO, who had a very successful company. But when it came to his style of management; his style of deal making; and, more importantly, what Jensen could do for President Trump in terms of helping him negotiate international accords, he's now become a show pony that Trump brings around to world leaders. He brags about how successful Huang is. He says this is really an example of American ingenuity and innovation.

But, I don't think any of that existed when Trump took office in January.

Tell me about how this relationship develops, then, and evolves. 

I have to go to 2022; we're in the Biden administration. What they did was they took certain products, certain classes of products, which generally meant very powerful microchips and said, “You can't sell these overseas to certain companies.” At the time, the AI race was just really heating up. But Nvidia was not allowed to sell its chips in China, in particular, because there were serious national security concerns and serious concerns about competition and not letting China catch up with us.

That was a big deal for Nvidia, because it really limited how quickly it could expand around the world. Fast forward to this year, and Donald Trump is back in the White House for a second term, and Jensen Huang obviously needed to revisit this issue.

There were a number of influential people in the Trump National Security Council who successfully made the argument that it's a bad idea for us to be selling our most advanced technology to the Chinese. And, in that context, Jensen Huang starts building a friendship with Donald Trump because it was gonna be very important for him to be on friendly terms with a president, given how this war of ideas was shaking out.

In August of this year, he goes to Trump. He says, “What do I have to do to get you to let me sell this chip in China again?” And the deal they come to, after a lot of negotiations between Nvidia and the Trump administration, is that the White House asks Jensen to let the federal government in on their success by giving the government a stake in the company.

This is a huge win for Jensen Huang. But there's a problem: The Chinese say to all the customers in their country, “Don't buy this thing. It's not safe. It has security concerns.” So, Nvidia starts developing a new chip for China. It's called the B 30 A.

And, this is too much. This proves to be too much for people in Washington who are concerned about national security, concerned about competition with China. And they've actually decided, unbeknownst to Jensen Huang, that they're not gonna approve high-quality chips to be sold in China.

And that's where we are. Nvidia is still locked out of China.

You see Wong joining Trump on international trips, consulting with the president on high level issues. What has been going on with these two guys behind the scenes? 

There's a lot of speculation about whether this is another Elon Musk-type situation. President Trump always likes to have a tech billionaire who he can consult with and bounce ideas off of. One thing to know about Donald Trump, and I know this because I've spoken to him about it directly, is that he really likes people when they're successful.

He likes that successful people are on his team. When it dawned on Trump that this guy, Jensen Huang, was just a really successful, brilliant executive, and he was building something really special and big and powerful in Nvidia, Trump really seized on that. It caught his attention, and he decided that he really liked Jensen Huang. They now speak often on the phone. Trump will call Jensen Huang late at night, pick his brain about things. Jensen's a frequent visitor to the White House, which is something that he'd never done before this year, really.

But, in the last month, he has backed off of his seemingly unshakable commitment to let Nvidia sell its products in China. I don't think it's reflective of any kind of personality clash. I think that Jenssen's been very good at managing the relationship, and he's pledging his support to the most powerful president on Planet Earth using the language that that president loves to hear.

Does Jensen Huang want to work in government like Musk did, or does the guy just want to sell his chips in China and do what's best for his business? 

I don't have any reason to believe that he does have those kinds of ambitions. I think that Jensen Huang has been thrust into this sort of role as an international diplomat, and as a lobbyist, and all these different roles that he's had to play. They're very new to him.

I think that his primary concern is doing what's best for his company, selling as much product as he can around the world. Even more than that, he wants to get the whole world hooked on his technology and make Nvidia more central to the long-term picture of how tech develops and how AI develops.

            President Donald Trump has leaned into his clemency powers during his second term, dishing out pardons to more than 1,000 January 6 US Capitol rioters, former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, baseball legend Darryl Strawberry, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani — and now: Gobble and Waddle.
    


            Justice will be served at the White House on Tuesday as Trump pardons a pair of turkeys for fowl reasons, participating in the 78th annual National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation.
    


            The president will make much ado about stuffing and appeal to his baste at the Thanksgiving roast, a yearly opportunity for a cornucopia of puns and a moment to give thanks — providing some levity amid a range of global crises and plenty of political upheaval.
    


            Unlike previous years, just one turkey will take part in the ceremonial pardon, injecting little suspense into the process. (Both turkeys, according to the office of the first lady, will ultimately be spared.) First lady Melania Trump's office invited the American people to vote for which turkey would participate by texting “Gobble” or “Waddle” to 45470.
    


            Hatched last July in North Carolina, Gobble and Waddle weigh in at 52 and 50 pounds, respectively, and rode the gravy train to Washington. They spent their young lives training for their pardon, getting acclimated to loud sounds, big crowds and bright lights ahead of a luxe stay in a suite at the nearby Willard InterContinental Hotel.
    


            Following Tuesday's festivities, the birds will retreat to North Carolina State University's Prestage Department of Poultry Science in Raleigh to live out a relieved retirement.
    


White House holiday festivities get underway despite ballroom construction



            Rumors of turkey pardons go back in presidential history as far as Abraham Lincoln's administration. Folklore has it that Lincoln's young son asked his father to spare a pet turkey that was supposed to be part of their Thanksgiving dinner.
    


            A competitive version of the ceremony became national news in 1920, when a turkey from Texas sent to Woodrow Wilson in a White House-shaped crate battled outside the People's House with a turkey from Kentucky. The Kentucky bird emerged victorious, according to the White House Historical Association.
    


            The National Turkey Federation became the official turkey supplier to the first family in 1947, and the formal turkey presentation ceremony has been around since Harry Truman's tenure. Truman had asked Americans to observe poultry-less Thursdays to support rationing in Europe after World War II, according to the National Archives. The policy wasn't very popular, and the federation presented Truman with a live turkey as a sign of protest, kicking off the annual tradition. While Truman was the first to accept a turkey from the group, he did not offer it a pardon.
    


            The first documented turkey pardon was given by John F. Kennedy in 1963, though it didn't catch on right away. Even though Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon, neither decided to pardon any turkeys as president.
    


            Turkey pardoning became the norm in 1989, when George H.W. Bush revived the tradition, now a staple of the White House holiday season.
    


            This will mark Trump's fifth turkey pardon, and, like his recent predecessors, he has peppered the event with topical political jokes.
    


            Trump poked fun at the impeachment inquiry against him in 2019, telling a crowd that the turkeys “have already received subpoenas to appear in Adam Schiff's basement,” referring to the California Democrat, then a congressman.
    


            Former President Joe Biden nodded to the 2022 midterm election dynamics when he pardoned Chocolate and Chip: “The votes are in, they've been counted and verified, no ballot stuffing, no fowl play. The only red wave this season is going to be if German shepherd Commander knocks over the cranberry sauce.”
    


            And Barack Obama employed his signature rhetoric in 2016: “I want to take a moment to recognize the great turkeys who weren't so lucky, who didn't get to ride the gravy train to freedom. Who met their fate with courage and sacrifice and proved that they weren't chicken.”
    


            “Yes, we cran,” Obama added.

            After more than a century of munching on her favorite foods of romaine lettuce and cactus fruit, beloved Galápagos tortoise Gramma, the oldest resident of the San Diego Zoo, has died.
    


            Gramma was born in her native habitat and was estimated to be about 141 years old, zoo officials said. She died Nov. 20.
    


            It's not clear exactly when the tortoise arrived at the San Diego Zoo, but zoo officials said she came from the Bronx Zoo in either 1928 or 1931 as part of their first group of Galápagos tortoises.
    


            As the world changed around her, she delighted visitors with her sweet, shy personality. She lived through two World Wars and 20 US presidents.
    


            Her care specialists affectionately called her “the Queen of the Zoo.” She was suffering from bone conditions related to her old age that progressed recently before she was euthanized, the zoo said.
    


            Many visitors commented on social media about getting to first visit Gramma when they were young, and being able to come back years later with their kids.
    


Galapagos tortoise species was thought to be extinct until a female loner's discovery



            Cristina Park, 69, said one of her earliest memories from her childhood was going to the San Diego Zoo when she was 3 or 4 years old and riding on the back of a tortoise. That's no longer allowed, but the experience inspired her to keep a small desert tortoise as a pet and learn more about tortoise conservation.
    


            “Just how amazing it is that they managed to live through so much,” Park said. “And yet they're still there.”
    


            Galapagos tortoises can live for over 100 years in the wild, and close to double that in captivity.
    


            The oldest known Galapagos tortoise was named Harriet, who lived at the Australia Zoo until the age of 175. She was collected from the Galapagos Islands in 1835, when she was just the size of a dinner plate, according to the zoo. This means that she hatched somewhere around 1830, and she died in 2006.
    


            Galápagos tortoises include 15 subspecies of tortoises from the islands, three of which were deemed extinct. The rest are all vulnerable or critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
    


            Concerted efforts have been made to breed these tortoises in captivity over the past several decades, with more than 10,000 juveniles released to the wild since 1965, according to the Galápagos Conservancy. Some subspecies have been brought back from the brink of extinction.
    


            In April, four baby Galápagos tortoises were born at the Philadelphia Zoo to first-time parents that were roughly 100 years old, a first in the zoo's history. In June, Zoo Miami resident and Galápagos tortoise Goliath became a first-time father at the age of 135.

SEOUL—As China and the U.S. race to dominate artificial intelligence, countries are increasingly wary of becoming overly dependent on the superpowers for a technology that could profoundly affect their economic competitiveness and national security.

In response, a select few are seeking to build out their own AI capabilities and become leaders alongside the U.S. and China.

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Tyson Foods' decision to close a beef plant that employs nearly one third of residents of Lexington, Nebraska, could devastate the small city and undermine the profits of ranchers nationwide.

Closing a single slaughterhouse might not seem significant, but the Lexington plant employs roughly 3,200 people in the city of 11,000 and has the capacity to slaughter some 5,000 head of cattle a day. Tyson also plans to cut one of the two shifts at a plant in Amarillo, Texas, and eliminate 1,700 jobs there. Together those two moves will reduce beef processing capacity nationwide by 7-9%.

Consumers may not see prices change much at the grocery store over the next six months because all the cattle that are now being prepared for slaughter will still be processed, potentially just at a different plant. But in the long run, beef prices may continue to climb even higher than the current record highs — caused by a variety of factors from drought to tariffs — unless American ranchers decide to raise more cattle, which they have little incentive to do.

An increase in beef imports from Brazil, like President Donald Trump encouraged last week by slashing tariffs on the South American country, may help insulate consumers while ranchers and feedlots struggle with high costs and falling prices. 

Here's what we know about the impact of the plant closure and the changing tariffs:




Clay Patton, vice president of the Lexington-area Chamber of Commerce said Monday that Tyson's announcement Friday felt like a “gut punch” to the community in the Platte River Valley that serves as a key link in the agricultural production chain.

When it opened in 1990, the Lexington plant that Tyson later acquired revitalized and remade the formerly dwindling town by attracting thousands of immigrants to work there and nearly doubling the population.

When the plant closes in January, the ripple effects will be felt throughout the community, undermining many first-generation business owners and the investment in new housing, Patton said. Tyson said it will offer Lexington workers the chance to move to take open jobs at one of its other plants if they are willing to uproot their families for jobs hundreds of miles away.

“I'm hopeful that we can come through this and we'll actually become better on the other side of it,” Patton said. 

Elmer Armijo was struck by how established the community was when he moved to Lexington last summer to lead First United Methodist Church. He described solid job security, good schools and health care systems and urban development — all in doubt now.

“People are completely worried,” Armijo said. “The economy in Lexington is based in Tyson.”

Many local churches, Armijo's included, are already offering counseling, food pantries and gas vouchers for community members.

The prospect of losing a major buyer for cattle and increasing imports from Brazil, which already accounted for 24% of the beef brought into the country this year, only adds to doubts about how profitable the U.S. cattle business might be over the next several years, making it less likely that American ranchers will commit to raising more animals.

“There's a just a lack of confidence in the industry right now. And producers are unwilling to make the investment to rebuild,” said Bill Bullard, president of Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockgrowers of America. 

Boosting imports from Brazil has the potential to affect the market — much more than Trump's suggestion to increase imports from Argentina — since the country sends more beef to America than any other. But for steak lovers, the sky-high price of the cut isn't likely to be affected regardless, as most imports are lean trimmings that get mixed into ground beef.

Kansas State University agricultural economist Glynn Tonsor said it's hard to predict whether imports will continue to account for roughly 20% of the U.S. beef supply next year. He pointed out that Trump's tariffs have changed several times since they were announced in the spring and could quickly change again.

The only constant in the equation has been that consumers have continued to buy beef even as prices soar. Tonsor said on average Americans will consume 59 pounds (27 kilograms) of beef per person this year. 

There has long been excess capacity in the meat business nationwide, meaning the nation's slaughterhouses could handle many more cattle than they are processing. That has only been made worse in recent years as the government has encouraged more smaller companies to open slaughterhouses to compete with Tyson and the other giants that dominate the beef business. 

Tyson expects to lose more than $600 million on beef production this year after already reporting $720 million of red ink in beef over the past two years.

Tonsor said it was inevitable that at least one beef plant would close. Afterward, Tyson's remaining plants will be able to operate more efficiently at closer to full capacity. 

Ernie Goss, an economist at Creighton University in Omaha, said the Lexington plant likely wasn't measuring up in the industry increasingly reliant on technological advancements that enhance productivity.

“It's very difficult to renovate or make the old plant fit the new world,” said Goss, who completed an impact study for a new Sustainable Beef plant. The Lexington facility “just wasn't competitive right now in today's environment in terms of output per worker.”

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pleaded with the public on Monday to act and dress with respect as they travel this holiday season, citing recent trends of unruly behavior in U.S. airports.

The Department of Transportation unveiled a “civility campaign” last week, encouraging people to travel with respect and courtesy toward others due to increasing numbers of in-flight outbursts and unruly passenger incidents.

Duffy echoed this message on Monday, encouraging travelers to both act and dress appropriately as they travel to crowded airports, highways, and railroads during the busy travel season ahead of Thanksgiving. Duffy called on travelers to “think about those who are around us” and “call on our better angels” instead of giving in to travel frustrations.

“We should say a please and thank you to our pilots and to our to our flight attendants,” Duffy said. “Whether it's a pair of jeans and a decent shirt, I would encourage people to maybe dress a little better, which encourages us to maybe all behave a little better. Let's try not to wear slippers in and pajamas as we come to the airport.”

In addition to requesting that travelers leave their sweat sets behind, he also asked fliers to help others load their bags into the overhead storage bins.

“Common courtesy and civility, I think, is going to work well. I ask you to please be patient with our TSA and our gate agents. They're working their hearts out to make sure that this is the best experience possible for you and the safest experience possible for you. A little gratitude goes a long way,” Duffy said.

The DOT said the Federal Aviation Administration has seen a 400% increase in in-flight outbursts since 2019, pushing the agency to run its “The Golden Age of Travel Starts with You” civility campaign this year.

“I fly a lot and I've had delays, I've had cancellations, like many of you. But if you are delayed or canceled, know that it comes from a place of your safety and mine,” Duffy said. “If it's weather, if it's mechanical, if it's air traffic control, staffing issues, those are the factors that are considered as those decisions are being made.”

FAA SAYS $10,000 BONUSES ONLY FOR WORKERS WITH PERFECT ATTENDENCE DURING SHUTDOWN

The campaign comes on the heels of the recent 43-day shutdown, during which airports felt the impact of the lapse in appropriations, as flights were delayed and canceled, and air traffic controllers and technicians worked without paychecks.

The strong effect raised questions about how quickly the industry could bounce back from the shutdown, as the holiday season, one of the busiest travel times of the year, is just around the corner.

The federal government plans to release a shutdown-delayed estimate for third quarter economic growth just before Christmas.

The Commerce Department said Monday it will publish its initial estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product on Dec. 23, nearly two months after a first look at the data was initially scheduled. Government statistical agencies are broadly playing catch-up after the shutdown ran from Oct. 1 into mid-November, delaying a bevy of reports economists and policymakers rely on to measure the health of the economy.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — A task force ordered by President Donald Trump to combat crime in Memphis, Tennessee, has made thousands of arrests, compounding strains on the busy local court system and an already overcrowded jail in ways that concerned officials say will last months or even years as cases play out. 

Since late September, hundreds of federal, state and local law enforcement personnel tied to the Memphis Safe Task Force have made traffic stops, served warrants and searched for fugitives in the city of about 610,000 people. More than 2,800 people have been arrested and more than 28,000 traffic citations have been issued, data provided by the task force and Memphis police shows.

The task force, which includes National Guard troops, is supported by Republican Gov. Bill Lee and others who hope the surge reduces crime in a city that has grappled with violent crime, including nearly 300 homicides last year and nearly 400 in 2023.

On Monday, Attorney General Pam Bondi traveled to Memphis to meet with officers and tout the task force's success in taking suspects and illegal guns off the street. Bondi and other law enforcement leaders later served food to officers to thank them for their work.

Asked about the strain on the local criminal justice system, U.S. Marshals Service Director Gadyaces Serralta said authorities are bringing as many cases as they can in federal court. He said federal officials are open to working with state prosecutors to find ways to speed up prosecutions.

“If we don't speed up the process, it's going to continue to back up,” Serralta said. But, he said, “because we can't put them through the criminal justice system does not mean that it's a free pass to commit crimes. We're going to keep arresting folks. They keep committing crimes, we're going to keep arresting them.”




From 2018 to 2024, homicides in Memphis increased 33% and aggravated assaults rose 41%, according to AH Datalytics, which tracks crimes across the country using local law enforcement data for its Real-Time Crime Index. But AH Datalytics reported those numbers were down 20% during the first nine months of this year, even before the task force got to work.

Opponents of the task force in majority-Black Memphis say it targets minorities and intimidates law-abiding Latinos, some of whom have skipped work and changed social habits, such as avoiding going to church or restaurants, fearing they will be harassed and unfairly detained. Statistics released at the end of October showed 319 arrests so far on administrative warrants, which deal with immigration-related issues.

The effects have rippled beyond the streets, into the aging criminal courthouse and the troubled jail. Officials are concerned about long waits in traffic court causing people to miss work and packed criminal court dockets forcing inmates to spend extra days waiting for bail hearings.

“The human cost of it is astounding,” said Josh Spickler, executive director for Just City, a Memphis-based organization that advocates for fairness in the criminal justice system.

The mayor of Shelby County, which includes Memphis, has requested more judges to hear cases that could span months or years. County officials are discussing opening court at night and on weekends, a move that would help manage the caseload but cost more.

Meanwhile, Shelby County Jail inmates are being moved to other facilities because of overcrowding, officials say. Inmates at jail intake are sleeping in chairs, and jail officials are asking county commissioners for funding to help address problems, such as a corrections employees shortage.

These issues raise concerns from activists and officials about safety in a jail that has seen 65 deaths since 2019, according to Just City. Court case backlogs mean defendants and crime victims could spend an unfair amount of time dealing with the criminal justice system, said Steve Mulroy, the county's district attorney. 

“The task force deployment probably could have used more planning,” said Mulroy, a Democrat whose office is cooperating with the task force. “More thought could have been put into the downstream effects of the increased arrest numbers.” 

There were hundreds more jail bookings and bail settings during the first several weeks of the task force's operation than during the comparable period last year, an increase of about 40% in each category, according to county statistics.

The jail, which has a regular capacity of 2,400, had an average daily population of 3,195 inmates in September, the most recent month when statistics were available. County officials said that number was expected to rise for October.

As of mid-November, 250 overflow jail detainees were being housed at other facilities, compared with 80 in November 2024. Some of those are outside Shelby County, which makes it harder for lawyers and relatives to visit and increases the cost of bringing defendants to Memphis for hearings. 

In a letter to commissioners, Chief Jailer Kirk Fields has requested at least $1.5 million in emergency funds, noting that more inmates means more expenses for food, clothing, bedding and linens.

One issue is whether there are enough judges to hear cases, especially after lawmakers eliminated two judgeships during last year's session. 

On Oct. 31, Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris wrote to state court officials asking for additional judges, saying the county is preparing for at least 3,500 to 5,000 people being arrested. More arrests increase jail expenses and the possible hiring of more public defenders, prosecutors and jail employees, he wrote.

“This places Shelby County in extreme financial peril,” Harris wrote. 

The Tennessee Supreme Court's response said that while lower court judges reported more judges are not necessary at this time, it has designated two senior judges to help should they be needed.

“Part of it is, understanding just what the cadence is going to look like over the next few months and then developing a strategy,” the governor said earlier this month, noting that the state is monitoring the situation.

Some officials have proposed Saturday court sessions and night court sessions two or three nights a week, Mulroy said. They've considered having a clinic where people facing misdemeanor warrants could surrender, to help clear those up.

Mulroy's office also is reevaluating whether detention is necessary for people jailed in hundreds of low-level cases.

“If there's no basis to think they're a danger to the community or a flight risk, and they're in there just because they can't afford their bail, we can take a second look,” he wrote.

Ryan Guay, a U.S. Marshals Service and task force spokesperson, told The Associated Press that the high volume of arrests reflects the force's effectiveness.

“We recognize that this success places additional demands on the broader criminal justice system, including courts and detention facilities,” Guay said.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons has said that it is making a satellite prison camp available to the task force. The bureau said the Shelby County Sheriff's Office would assume oversight of the facility. A sheriff's office spokesperson declined to comment on the camp's location, citing operational security.

The FBI is seeking to interview Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and five other congressional Democrats in connection with their appearance in a video encouraging members of the U.S. military to refuse to follow illegal orders, several of those lawmakers confirmed Tuesday.

President Donald Trump last week blasted the video, accusing Kelly and the other lawmakers of "seditious behavior," calling them "traitors," and saying that, "In the old days, if you said a thing like that, that was punishable by death."

The other lawmakers on the video were Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, as well as House Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania.

"President Trump is using the FBI as a tool to intimidate and harass members of Congress," Goodlander, Crow, Deluzio, and Houlahan said in a joint statement.

"Yesterday, the FBI contacted the House and Senate  Sergeants at Arms requesting interviews," the statement said. 

"No amount of intimidation or  harassment will ever stop us from doing our jobs and honoring our Constitution," the lawmakers said. "We swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of  the United States. That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep  it. We will not be bullied. We will never give up the ship."

Fox News first reported on the FBI's efforts.

Earlier Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth lashed out online over Kelly's display of his U.S. Navy medals after the Pentagon began investigating him for encouraging service members to refuse to obey unlawful orders.

"So 'Captain' Kelly, not only did your sedition video intentionally undercut good order & discipline … but you can't even display your uniform correctly," Hegseth snapped in a post on X, which replied to a tweet by Kelly showing his medals.

"Your medals are out of order & rows reversed. When/if you are recalled to active duty, it'll start with a uniform inspection," said Hegseth, a former Fox News host and a former major in the Army National Guard.

The Pentagon on Monday said it was investigating "serious allegations of misconduct" against Kelly, who is a retired Navy captain, for his role in the video. 

The Pentagon said Kelly could be recalled to active military duty and face a possible court-martial for potential violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

The UCMJ requires service members to obey "any lawful general order or regulation."

Kelly, in response Monday, posted on X a statement saying that the Pentagon's probe "won't work" if "this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable."

His post also included a close-up photo of Kelly in his Naval uniform, showing the medals on the shirt's breast pocket.

"Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders," Kelly said on the video, which was tweeted on Nov. 18 by Slotkin of Michigan, a former CIA analyst.

Slotkin wrote in her tweet: "We want to speak directly to members of the Military and the Intelligence Community. The American people need you to stand up for our laws and our Constitution. Don't give up the ship."

The video was made as the U.S. military, under Trump, has carried out more than 20 airstrikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean against purported drug smugglers, killing scores of people on those vessels.

The legality of those strikes, which were made without congressional authorization, has been questioned.

On Monday, a group of Democratic senators, including Kelly and Slotkin, wrote Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi to request that they declassify a Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel's written opinion from September on the domestic and international legal basis for the strikes.

"Few decisions are more consequential for a democracy than the use of lethal force," the letter said.

"We therefore believe that the declassification and public release of this important document would enhance transparency in the use of deadly force by our Nation's military and is necessary to ensure Congress and the American people are fully informed of the legal justification supporting these strikes," it said.

Campbell Soup Company put an executive on leave while investigating claims made in a lawsuit that he trashed the company behind closed doors, including mocking its "poor" customers and saying the company's meat "came from a 3D printer."

In a statement Tuesday, the company said the alleged comments by Martin Bally, Campbell's vice president of information technology, were "unacceptable."

"Such language does not reflect our values and the culture of our company," the company said. "We do not tolerate that kind of language under any circumstances."

The move follows a lawsuit filed Thursday in a Michigan court by Robert Garza, a former cybersecurity analyst at the company who said he was fired after complaining about Bally.

According to the lawsuit, Garza recorded a meeting with Bally where the executive insulted the intelligence of his Indian colleagues and said the company's products were for "poor people."

The law firm representing Garza provided Business Insider with an apparent recording of the meeting. The recording was not included as an exhibit in the lawsuit, and Business Insider hasn't independently authenticated it.

The recording features a conversation where a person belittles Campbell and its products.

"If you look at our fucking pantry — we have shit for fucking poor people, right?" the person said.

"I don't buy fucking Campbell's products barely anymore," the person continues in the tirade. "It's unhealthy."

At one point in the recording of the meeting, which appears to take place at a restaurant, the person refers to Campbell's food as "bioengineered."

"Even in a can of soup — I look at it, and look at bioengineered meat," the person said. "I don't want to eat a fucking piece of chicken that came from a 3D printer, do you?"

Elsewhere in the recorded conversation, the person recounts an instance where he tried to help a colleague with a tech issue. He blamed "Indians" in an expletive-filled rant for not resolving it without him.

Bally didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

In its statement Tuesday, Campbell said the remarks about its food were "patently absurd" and that the chicken meat in its soups "comes from long-trusted, USDA approved U.S. suppliers."

"Keep in mind, the alleged comments heard on the audio were made by a person in IT, who has nothing to do with how we make our food," the company said.

The audio has become a public relations nightmare for the soup-maker. Despite Campbell's denials, the remarks about bioengineered and 3D-printed chicken have bounced around social media and drawn the attention of Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, who said he would investigate the company.

"Florida law bans lab-grown meat," Uthmeier posted on X. "Our Consumer Protection division is launching an investigation and will demand answers from Campbell's."

The person in the recorded meeting had other criticisms for Campbell.

He bemoaned the lack of innovation in the food industry and said the company overpaid for its 2023 acquisition of Sovos Brands, which makes Rao's pasta sauce, for $2.7 billion.

Dropping a bunch of F-bombs, he said Sovos was just a "recipe and a brand." 

"We don't own a plant. Somebody else manufactures it for us," he said, calling the situation "smoke and mirrors."

The fight between Nvidia and one of its loudest naysayers, investor Michael Burry, is escalating.

Following the "Big Short" investor's series of social media posts arguing that the artificial intelligence investment boom is replaying the dotcom bubble from the 1990s, with Nvidia at the center of it, the chipmaker quietly circulated a private memo to analysts that explicitly name-checked Burry to push back on many of his claims.

"Nvidia emailed a memo to Wall Street sell side analysts to push back on my arguments on SBC and Depreciation. I stand by my analysis," Burry said in a post on Substack, referring to stock-based compensation. "I am not claiming Nvidia is Enron. It is clearly Cisco."

Burry has repeatedly warned that today's AI infrastructure frenzy mirrors the late-1990s telecom buildout far more than the dot-com wipeouts investors remember. He pointed to massive capex plans, extended depreciation schedules and soaring valuations as evidence that markets are again mistaking a supply boom for durable demand. 

The Nvidia memo, first reported by Barron's, responded to Burry's criticism towards Nvidia's stock-based compensation dilution and stock buybacks.

"NVIDIA repurchased $91B shares since 2018, not $112.5B; Mr. Burry appears to have incorrectly included RSU taxes," the memo said. "Employee equity grants should not be conflated with the performance of the repurchase program. NVIDIA's employee compensation is consistent with that of peers. Employees benefitting from a rising share price does not indicate the original equity grants were excessive at the time of issuance."The memo also disputed Burry's claims around depreciation life. To Burry's charge that customers are overstating the useful lives of Nvidia's graphics processing units in order to justify runaway capital expenditures, Nvidia counters that its customers depreciate GPUs over four to six years based on real-world longevity and utilization patterns. 

Nvidia added that older GPUs such as A100s, released in 2020, continue to run at high utilization rates and retain meaningful economic value well beyond the two to three years claimed by critics.

The memo also rejects Burry's suggestion of "circular financing," saying Nvidia's strategic investments represent a small fraction of revenue and that AI startups raise capital predominantly from outside investors.

Burry said he believes Nvidia now occupies the same position that Cisco — the key hardware supplier that powered a massive capital investment cycle — held in 1999-2000. 

Just as telecommunication companies spent tens of billions of dollars laying fiber optic cable and buying Cisco gear based on forecasts that "internet traffic doubles every 100 days," today's hyperscalers are promising nearly $3 trillion in AI infrastructure spending over the next three years, Burry said in a Substack newsletter.

The heart of his Cisco analogy is overbuilt supply meeting far less demand than expected. In the early 2000s, less than 5% of U.S. fiber capacity was operational, Burry said. Today, he believes the industry's belief in boundless AI demand rests on similarly optimistic assumptions about data center power and GPU longevity, he said. 

"And once again there is a Cisco at the center of it all, with the picks and shovels for all and the expansive vision to go with it. Its name is Nvidia," Burry wrote.

TSMC on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against a former senior vice president it accused of leaking "confidential information" to Intel.

Wei-Jen Lo joined Intel after 21 years at TSMC, having left in July, the Taiwanese chip maker said in a statement, announcing the lawsuit.

The lawsuit is based on Lo's employment contract and non-compete agreement with TSMC, and regulations such as the Trade Secrets Act, the statement said. 

"There is a high probability that Lo uses, leaks, discloses, delivers, or transfers TSMC's trade secrets and confidential information to Intel," it said. 

TSMC's share price fell on Tuesday and was last seen over 3% lower. 

Intel did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

It follows earlier reports by local media and later by Reuters, which stated Lo may have taken TSMC's technology data to Intel. Taiwan's High Prosecutors opened an investigation into the allegations. 

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan told Bloomberg News last week that his "company respects intellectual property rights" and denied any wrongdoing. 

The U.S. firm's stock price moved 1.5% lower in mid-morning trade.

It's increasingly looking like Nvidia isn't the only game in town when it comes to AI-enabling hardware.

Nvidia stock dropped on Tuesday as investors took in a report that Meta could buy billions worth of Google's AI chips in the coming years. The Facebook parent is currently one of Nvidia's biggest chip customers.

Nvidia, the biggest company in the world by market cap, saw shares fall 6% after rising 2% in Monday's session. Alphabet stock jumped as much as 4%.

But Nvidia wasn't the only chip name to suffer sharp losses. AMD was down as much as 10%, Intel stock fell 1%, and Micron Technology and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing each lost 3%. The losses among top chip names dragged the Nasdaq lower by 1%, outpacing the losses in the other major indexes.

Here's where US indexes stood at 10:15 a.m. ET on Tuesday:



The Information reported that Meta could incorporate Google's tensor processing units in its data centers several years from now, and could start renting TPUs from the company as soon as next year.

Meta, one of the most voracious spenders in the AI trade, has said it could spend as much as $72 billion on capital expenditures next year, much of which is expected to be invested in AI infrastructure.

"Google Cloud is experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and NVIDIA GPUs; we are committed to supporting both, as we have for years," an Alphabet spokesperson told Business Insider.

Meta and Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.

Semiconductor stocks were broadly in the red on Tuesday, with the exception of Broadcom, which helps Google design and manufacture its chips. Broadcom stock jumped 11% on Monday as investors piled in as another way to bet on Google's growing dominance in the AI arms race.



It's been a choppy few weeks for the AI sector, but specifically for Nvidia. Shares of the GPU producer initially popped after it reported stellar earnings for the third quarter, but then started to drop as fears of an AI bubble crept back into the picture.

The company has also been defending itself against criticisms from "The Big Short" investor Michael Burry, who has sounded the alarm for a stock market bubble in recent weeks.

Nvidia shares are down 12% from their peak in late October. The stock is still up 32% year-to-date.

Alphabet, on the other hand, has been on a tear as the company gains dominance in the AI trade. Shares have rallied 18% over the past month and are up 67% in 2025.

"Alphabet is the only large player trading in positive territory this morning. It's fair to say that investors seem quite nervous currently," David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note of the recent volatility in the tech sector.

WHERE: CNBC's "Squawk Box"

BECKY QUICK:  Welcome back to "Squawk Box." President Trump announcing that he will be visiting Beijing in April following a phone call with Chinese President Xi. The two continued their discussions on China's agreement to purchase U.S. soybeans while the U.S. lowers tariffs on China. Joining us right now with more on the U.S.-China trade latest is Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. And, Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for being with us this morning. 

SCOTT BESSENT: Good morning, Becky. Good morning, Andrew. 

QUICK: Why don't we start with this latest? What we're seeing right now and what we've heard from this conversation with President Trump and President Xi. The readouts from the two countries were a little different. Obviously, the United States has a very important push on making sure that China does step up its purchases of soybeans. How is that going? 

BESSENT: Well, first of all, Becky, to set the record straight, President Trump initiated the call 30 days after the historic meeting in Busan, South Korea, between the two leaders. They have a great relationship. And as far as the soybeans, the Chinese are right on schedule in terms of the cadence of their purchases. Over the next three and a half years, we're going to see the 87.5 million metric tons purchased by the Chinese minimum, minimum. And they are right on schedule. 

QUICK:  There have been some reports coming from China where their take on this talk is a little different. At least what they emphasized in the talks was a little different. They bring up both Ukraine and the U.S. position, and the China, Chinese position on Taiwan. What is the U.S. position on Taiwan at this point? 

BESSENT:  U.S. position on Taiwan is unchanged. And on Ukraine, President and Party Chair Xi agreed that the peace in this Ukraine conflict, they must move forward, and they agreed to work together on it. 

QUICK: Am I right to think that this is a truce, but maybe a little bit of an uneasy truce at this point? How secure and settled are you feeling with where we stand with China right now? 

BESSENT: Well, we have, we have a one year, what I would say, pause. And, Becky, what I feel very good about is the relationship between the leaders because when the leaders can have calls like this at the highest level, then bad things don't happen. It was the strong relationship. President Trump showing leadership that sort of calm things down between the two countries. And look, we're always going to be rivals. We're always going to be rivals. That's natural. But are there things we can do together? Yes, we have the relationship in a good place. President Trump is going to do a state visit to Beijing. Xi is going to come to the U.S. for a state visit. He'll also be in the U.S. for the G20 at Doral. And President Trump may attend the APEC summit in Shenzhen in November. So, if there are four meetings during the year, I think that that gives the relationship great stability and stability is good for the American people and good for the world economy. 

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Mr. Secretary, I wanted to pivot the conversation. We've been talking all fall with you about the prospect of the president selecting a new Fed chair. And as we get closer to the end of the year, I wanted to get an update as to where things perhaps stand right now. 

BESSENT: Yeah. So, we're going to have the last interview in the second round today, Andrew. We have five very strong candidates. I'm impressed with all of them. And, Andrew, I'll tell you, one of the things in terms of the criteria that I've been looking for, that I have morphed a bit on in the fall when we started with 11 candidates, is in talking to these candidates, I realize the Fed has become this very complicated operation. It's no longer just a price setting of money. There's a very complicated calculus between the monetary policy, the, the balance sheet and regulatory policy.  And we've really emphasized in the interviews what's the interplay for that calculus in terms of, you know, the best way forward for the American economy and what the, what is, what is each person's point of view in terms of protecting the American people, protecting the economy and moving forward with the dual mandate? 

SORKIN: Can you, can you give us a hint? We often talk about the two Kevins, Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, being the frontrunners. Is that still the case? 

BESSENT: Andrew, I'm, still got one interview left, so I don't think it would be prudent to give any hints. And I think that there's very good chance that the president will make an announcement before Christmas. But it's his prerogative, whether it's the, before the Christmas holidays, and the New Year's. But things are moving along very well. 

QUICK: Mr. Secretary, last week the president, I'm not sure if he was joking or how serious he was about it. He said he loves everything you're doing, but if you don't get the Fed to lower interest rates soon, he might fire your butt. 

BESSENT: Well, the, Becky, if you were in the, if you were in the room, he was joking. And you know, the, again, I think that we've gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated and it's more than just cutting rates. We've got this balance sheet and what are we going to do with it? You know, the Fed has taken us into a new regime in what is called ample reserves regime. And it looks like that might be fraying a bit here in terms of whether the reserves are actually ample in the system. There are all these facilities and operations, the standing repo facility. And I think we've got to kind of simplify things. The other thing too, is that when you were on with Steve Liesman, you were showing all the Fed governors and the regional bank presidents kind of like baseball cards. And I think it's time for the Fed to just to move back into the background, like it used to do, calm things down and work for the American people, set monetary policy on a good course. That this isn't the, you know, this isn't sport. It's people's lives. And I think we just need to calm down. All these speeches by these bank presidents that are just redundant. Why don't they actually just come out and talk about the, you know, meaningful issues in the American people rather than the short-term view of the next meeting? 

QUICK: Well, to be fair, the Fed governors, you know, the presidents of the banks at least are hearing from people in their districts and each of them maybe hearing slightly different things about where the job market lays, where inflation lays. And that's probably useful information to hear from around the country. I guess. My bigger question—

BESSENT: No, no, but hold on for a minute, Becky—

QUICK: Yeah.

BESSENT: Is that the, but that's not what they're talking about. That's not what they're talking about in their district. They're talking about some macro and—

QUICK: Well, Susan Collins was saying she hears about inflation. She was just on last week with Steve Liesman, the Boston Fed president. And she was saying that she does hear a lot about inflation from within her district. That was kind of the part of that interview that jumped out to me the most. 

BESSENT: Well, the other thing I'll tell you that I find very interesting is, you know, these regional presidents were supposed to be people from the district, and it was supposed to break the New York hold on the reserve banks. And, you know, we've got at least three, maybe four of the reserve banks where people were hired from outside the district. They don't -- they don't even live in their district. They commute back to New York. So, these are New Yorkers. They are going out into the country and then coming back on weekends. I'm not sure that's the way the Federal Reserve was designed. 

SORKIN: Mr. Secretary, I'm curious how you grapple with this question. The president and I believe you yourself have talked about perhaps the need to lower interest rates. The president has clearly made that case. You know, if you, if you listen to some of these Fed governors, including Neel Kashkari and others, as they're trying to balance what appears to be, you know, an increase in unemployment or seemingly a little bit more unemployment against inflation fears -- how do you balance that in your mind right now, given the sort of clash of those two issues? 

BESSENT: Well, Neel Kashkari is a regional bank president, not a governor. And what I think is interesting is that the governors seem to be leaning toward cutting rates. And you know, again, Andrew, what I want to go back to is we've now got this very complicated calculus. And I believe, you know, when you're looking at monetary policy, you know what happened in the past, the, you try to have a view of what's happening now, and then you have a view of the future. And I think that the mistake that we're seeing a lot of times is either looking at them of looking in the rearview mirror, we're flying a little blind with the numbers here, but we've had two cuts thus far. And what do we know? That the Schumer shutdown, the longest in history, has shaved 1.5 percent of GDP, at least an $11 billion permanent hit. So, we know the economy hasn't gotten better. So, I'm not even sure what the discussion is here. 

SORKIN: And, Mr. Secretary, I had actually, maybe a curveball, maybe not. It was a curveball, I think, for all of us. I was curious what your reaction was watching the meeting between the president and the mayor-elect of New York, Mamdani. We've talked about the mayor-elect, us, on the air before, and some of the president's views about socialism and the like. It does seem like they were at least buddy-buddy on the issue of affordability. 

BESSENT: Well, Andrew, I was in the room, and I think that you've got to have some admiration for a candidate who ran a campaign the way he did. It was a great, great campaign. He is clearly the leader of the Democratic Party now. And I think it speaks to how open minded the president is that he invited him into the Oval. Senator Schumer never endorsed him. I don't even know if he's met with him. And President Trump wants the best for New Yorkers. I can tell you my impression of the mayor-elect is he's a young man with a lot of old ideas that have never worked. And point, point to one example where policies like his have led to anything other than a decline. But President Trump wants the best for the American people, and he hopes that New York will do well. It's easy to run a campaign, but the practical everyday of keeping, keeping people safe, picking up the trash, making the subways run on time, we'll see. 

QUICK:  Secretary Bessent, affordability has certainly been the keyword, particularly since those elections, not just of Mamdani but of the Democrats who won in both New Jersey and in Virginia. And there are a lot of questions about how to get our arms around those things. Healthcare is a big issue. The ACA tax credits being a big issue, too. There were reports that yesterday, the president had been considering saying that he would extend the Obamacare tax subsidies at least for a year until things can get worked out. MS NOW and other places are reporting that, that was kind of shut down. But I wonder if you could tell us what the administration's plan is on this front, what you think the best way forward is just in terms of trying to figure how, what to do on both a short-term and a long-term basis? 

BESSENT: Well, let's go back and just talk about affordability. On March 12th, 2024, the, I wrote a piece that got published and it was on the three I's that were the, hurting the American people. It was immigration, interest rates, inflation. We can come back to it. I would add the insanity, and the insanity on the Democratic side. So, we got four I's. Immigrate, this mass, unfettered immigration is now under control. The border's secure, which couldn't be done. That was putting substantial downward pressure on working class wages, upward pressure on rent for working people. Two, interest rates have come down. The bond market has had its best year since 2020. So, you can, you can mark those off. And now, we're working on the inflation. And this insanity of the Democratic Party shutting the government down. Now we've got this brinksmanship. They wanted, we'll reopen the government if you'll talk about health care. They wouldn't. And now here we are kind of on the eve. But I'm not involved in the conversation. I know President Trump wants working Americans to keep more of their money, cut out the insurance companies, and we'll see. He's the president of solutions, and I'm sure that we will have a solution to this. 

QUICK: The front page of "The Wall Street Journal" has an article today talking about how the economy is kind of addicted to AI spending. It points out that business investment in AI might have accounted for as much as half of the growth in the gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, in the first six months of the year, and questions whether if growth in that sector slows down, whether it tanks the entire economy. What, what's your thought on that? 

BESSENT: Yes. So, Becky, two weeks ago, I was at my hometown in Charleston, South Carolina. Boeing was doing a substantial expansion of their plant for the Dreamliner, thousands new great high-paying jobs. And I think next year, all the trade deals, and thanks to the tax bill, we're going to see, we're going to see a broadening out of the CapEx cycle. So, what we are seeing is that CapEx is spreading out. And historically, CapEx always leads to more jobs. This AI build out has been tremendous. It will continue to be. And you know, I would echo what my friend Joe Lonsdale said, that in the competition with the Chinese, this is pass-fail. That if we don't maintain our AI leadership, then everything else we're doing will be put to the side. But I'm very excited about the prospects for substantial non-inflationary growth last year because also the deregulation is going to kick in. And, you know, to go back to your question on the Fed, this is where I think we may be the, in a 1990s scenario. And Alan Greenspan had the ability to have a framework before looking, look at the productivity that was going on. And I think we're seeing that same kind of productivity here. So that's why I think you can have lower interest rates, higher growth and higher productivity. 

QUICK: Secretary Bessent, thank you for your time. We appreciate it, sir. 

BESSENT: Good. And tell Joe I hope he feels better. 

QUICK: We will. Thank you. 

BESSENT: Thanks. 

SORKIN: Thank you.

The American F-35 stealth fighters that participated in the Operation Midnight Hammer strikes on Iran flew hundreds of miles deep into its airspace and were the last ones out, US military commanders revealed this week.

F-35A Lightning II aircraft assigned to the Utah-based 388th Fighter Wing escorted the B-2 Spirit stealth bombers that dropped over a dozen heavy bunker-buster bombs on Iran's nuclear facilities in late June.

The F-35s suppressed Iran's air defenses and cleared the way for other combat aircraft, including the seven B-2s, during the complex nighttime operation.

"We flew hundreds of miles into Iran, escorting the B-2s the entire way," Lt. Col. Aaron Osborne, commander of the 34th Fighter Squadron, shared in a US Air Force story. "We employed weapons to great effect against multiple surface-to-air missile sites."

After the B-2s dropped a total of 14 bunker-buster bombs — 30,000-pound munitions called GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators — on Iranian nuclear facilities, the F-35s protected their exit from the attack zone.

The advanced US fighter jets were the last ones out of Iranian airspace, the 388th Fighter Wing said on Monday, sharing new details on the operation. US officials said Tehran did not fire at any American aircraft during Midnight Hammer.

The airmen of the 388th Fighter Wing, located at Hill Air Force Base in Utah, train nearly every day for suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) missions, the military said.

The F-35 pilots can use the jet's stealth, radar, targeting systems, and advanced sensors to detect surface-to-air missile threats, as they did in Iran.

The F-35 fighter, built by US defense giant Lockheed Martin, has been battle-tested against a wide range of threats in a mix of engagements since its first flight nearly 20 years ago — from Middle East wars to penetrating Israeli strikes inside Iran to the downing of Russian drones over NATO territory. The jet is flown by militaries around the world, including many NATO allies.

While the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is considered a top fifth-generation fighter jet, it is also the world's most expensive weapons program, with a lifetime cost of $2 trillion, and has faced sustainability and maintenance challenges in recent years, leading several Trump allies to publicly criticize the aircraft and its capabilities.

And tensions earlier this year between the Trump administration and some European allies have also raised questions about and even appeared to threaten future sales of the stealth jet.

However, Midnight Hammer commanders praised the F-35 and said that its participation in the operation highlights its combat prowess.

"The effectiveness of this strike validated all of the capabilities of the F-35 we've been talking about for years — stealth, lethality, sensor-fusion, being a force multiplier," said Col. Charles Fallon, 388th Fighter Wing commander.

He said the operation relied on the F-35 pilots and their aircraft to perform, "and both proved more than capable."

US forces struck three Iranian nuclear facilities — specifically Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan — with 75 precision weapons during Operation Midnight Hammer, which came amid a broader war between Iran and Israel. American officials said that the munitions included the bunker-busters and dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles.

Beyond the F-35s and B-2s, American F-22 fighter jets, as well as F-15s and F-16s, and dozens of aerial refueling tankers participated in the surprise operation, along with a US Navy missile submarine.

Private Credit Boom:

Wall Street's top prosecutor has a warning for private-market players getting creative with their numbers.

Stark divergences in how competing firms value private assets in their portfolios are drawing increasing attention from market participants, academics — and, now, the Department of Justice, according to Jay Clayton, the head of its Manhattan outpost.

Older Americans really don't like talking to their adult children about inheritances, a new study suggests.

About two-thirds — 68% — of parents age 55 or older with at least $500,000 in investable assets haven't told their grown children what they'll inherit or if they'll inherit anything at all, according to Fidelity Investments' 2025 Family and Finance Study. Roughly a third, 35%, don't want their children to know how much they'll get.

Reluctance to divulge estate plans is common, financial advisors say. Reasons can include concerns about demotivating their kids or starting conflict, or even just an unease with discussing money in general, said certified financial planner Mitchell Kraus, founder and principal of Capital Intelligence Associates in Santa Monica, California.

"But avoiding the conversation usually creates bigger problems later," Kraus said. 

The Fidelity study involved parents ages 55 and older with at least $500,000 in investable assets and whose children are ages 25 to 54, as well as a matched sample of adults ages 25 to 54 who have a living parent age 55 or older with at least $500,000 in investable assets.

The bulk of those adult children — 95% — say they're ready to manage inherited wealth, Fidelity found, even though 25% of their parents disagree.

Here's a look at more coverage of CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 list of top financial advisory firms for 2025:

There's an estimated $124 trillion that baby boomers — those born from 1946 to 1964 — and older generations will pass on between 2024 and 2048 as part of the so-called great wealth transfer, according to research from Cerulli Associates. Of that amount, $105 trillion is expected to go to heirs, and the remainder to charity. More than half of that $124 trillion is expected to come from people with at least $5 million in investable assets, according to Cerulli.

Financial advisors typically recommend discussing your estate plans with your adult children — even if you only offer a broad overview.

"We generally recommend they at least tell their kids how the assets are going to be divided," said CFP K.C. Smith, managing associate at Henssler Financial in Kennesaw, Georgia, which ranked No. 46 on CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 list this year.

"You can share some basic information about the structure of your estate plan, but you can keep the exact numbers undisclosed if you think it would be problematic," Smith said.

An estate plan isn't only for the rich. In basic terms, it should include not just a will that dictates where you want your assets to go, but also who gets powers of attorney for financial decisions if you are unable to handle them on your own, as well as a living will, which specifies your wishes for end-of-life health care.

There is a particular situation when it may be best not to discuss plans with an adult child, said certified financial planner David Kozlowski, president of Verus Financial Partners in Richmond, Virginia, which ranked No. 8 on the CNBC Financial Advisor 100 list this year.

It's "when they are still enabling their adult child," Kozlowski said.

If the goal is financial independence, "discussing inheritance with children that retirees are still supporting will lead to more dependence on their parents, not less, in our experience," he said.

Additionally, it may be harder to want to share information about unevenly passing on your assets — i.e., one sibling getting more or less than the others. However, financial advisors generally recommend getting the conversation out of the way to avoid conflict after you're gone.

"When parents explain the thinking behind their decisions, adult children almost always respond better, even if the plan isn't perfectly equal," Kraus said. "It gives them context and prevents that classic moment down the line when someone asks, 'Why did Mom do this?' at a time when no one can answer."

There also may be another reason to avoid talking about exact numbers, Smith said. "Just because there are 'X' dollars today, it doesn't mean it's going to look like that at death," he said.

Circumstances will change, Smith said, and it's impossible to know how dramatically. "If something happens that we had not projected, then the [inherited] amount could be substantially different," Smith said.

However, if the inheritance is likely to affect the child's estate or tax planning unexpectedly, it may be worth giving them a better idea of what's coming their way.

It's also a good idea to include some other key estate planning information with your adult children, such as who do they call if something happens to you, where is the will or trust document stored — "things like that so they aren't scrambling when they obviously are going to be grieving and doing an estate settlement, which can be complicated," Smith said.

Best Buy hiked its full-year forecast Tuesday, as it topped Wall Street's quarterly sales expectations and customers turned to the retailer to upgrade laptops and splurge on new gaming consoles and smartphones. 

The consumer electronics retailer said it now expects revenue of between $41.65 billion to $41.95 billion for the full year, higher than its previous range of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion. It expects adjusted earnings per share of $6.25 to $6.35, compared with its prior range of $6.15 to $6.30.

Best Buy said it expects full-year comparable sales, a metric that tracks sales online and at stores open at least 14 months, to range between a 0.5% rise to a 1.2% increase, compared with its previous expectations for a 1% decline and a 1% climb.

On the company's earnings call, CEO Corie Barry said Best Buy saw "better-than-expected" sales in the quarter because of strong results across computing, gaming and mobile phones, as well as growth in wearables and headphones. She said sales rose across both its website and stores. 

She said customer shopping behavior in the most recent three-month period was about the same as what Best Buy has seen for the past several quarters. 

"Customers remain resilient, but deal focused and attracted to more predictable sales moments," such as back-to-school sales and Best Buy's October sale that coincided with Amazon's Prime Day event, she said.

And she said, "while customers continued to be thoughtful about big ticket purchases in the current environment, they are willing to spend on high priced point products when they need to or when there is technology innovation."

Here's how the retailer did for the three-month period that ended Nov. 1 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Shares were up about 5% in morning trading on Tuesday. As of Monday's close, Best Buy's stock has dropped by about 12% this year. That compares with the 14% gains of the S&P 500 during the same period.

Best Buy has been waiting for some of the key catalysts that tend to drive its business, such as higher housing turnover that leads to appliance purchases, the tech innovations that spark demand for devices and expert advice, and the increased willingness by inflation-weary consumers to splurge on discretionary items. 

Some of that tech innovation appears to be gaining momentum with sales of the Nintendo Switch 2, new iPhones and AI-enabled laptops. The company called out those merchandise categories as strengths in the most recent three-month period.

Best Buy's net income for the fiscal third quarter fell to $140 million, or 66 cents per share, from net income of $273 million, or $1.26 per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, including stock-based compensation and restructuring charges, Best Buy reported earnings of $1.40.

Revenue rose from $9.45 billion in the year-ago quarter. 

Best Buy's comparable sales increased 2.7% year over year. That was the company's highest comparable sales growth in four years, Barry said.

In the U.S., the metric jumped 2.4%, as shoppers bought computers, gaming systems and mobile phones, but purchased fewer appliances and home theaters. 

Best Buy's annual revenue has dropped for the past three years. With the updated guidance, the company expects annual revenue to be slightly higher than last year's total of $41.53 billion.

Still, like other retailers, Best Buy said it's continuing to see shoppers spend selectively and seek out value, and anticipates that will carry into the holiday season, Barry said on a call with reporters.

"We absolutely are seeing people make trade offs," she said. 

For instance, she said, some customers are buying TVs in the middle or lower tier of its price range rather than premium TVs. However, she said Best Buy's reputation as a specialty retailer with many different brands and price points is helping it attract more low-income and younger customers.

As the holiday season heats up, Barry said the company is ready for key sales days like Black Friday and Cyber Monday and will have "deals across the spectrum for whenever people want to shop."

Even so, the retailer gave a cautious outlook for the holiday quarter, saying it expects sales trends to decelerate from the previous quarter. Bilunas said the company expects comparable sales during the period to range from a 1% decline to a 1% increase.

On the company's earnings call, he said Best Buy is seeing "positive growth" in the fourth quarter and a roughly similar trend to the third quarter, but faces tougher year over year comparisons and may see waning trends in some categories like gaming and wearables. In gaming, Nintendo Switch 2 sales haven't been as strong as they were closer to the June launch.

"Obviously, the holiday is never easy to predict," he said." What we do believe is that we have a range of scenarios and the range we've provided gives us a great place to plan and plan our business operationally." 

Higher tariffs will be a complicating factor for the rest of the year, both in how they affect the company's costs and consumer spending. On the company's earnings call, Bilunas said higher tariffs so far haven't had a meaningful impact on Best Buy's prices or its sales. He said growth is coming from more unit sales. 

Compared to other industries, he said, consumer electronics are a very promotional category and that's muted the impact on average selling prices, he said. 

At Best Buy's stores, the company has tried to give customers more reasons to try products by adding more vendor demos, Barry said on the company's earnings call. For example, she said more than 50 of its locations have immersive showcase areas for Meta's latest AI-enabled glasses, and demand for in-person demos has outpaced available appointments. 

It has launched most of its pilot showrooms with Ikea, which it is testing in 10 stores across Texas and Florida. And other vendors, including Breville and Sharkninja, are also showing off items for home baristas and chefs or customers looking for health and beauty devices in its stores, she said. 

Barry said "very early reads are positive and we are excited to monitor customer response during the holidays."

To help drive growth, Best Buy also launched a third-party marketplace in mid-August to expand the brands and the items that it sells. About three months into the launch, the company has more than 1,000 sellers and 11 times more individual items available for online customers than it did before, Barry said on the earnings call.

So far, she said the company is seeing higher sales in categories like accessories and small appliances. She said customer return rates for marketplace items have run lower than first-party purchases, and more than 80% of marketplace product returns by customers have been at stores. 

As the marketplace grows, she said it's driving higher profits and creating new opportunities for Best Buy to sell online ads.

Despite the positive signs, some of Best Buy's categories, including appliances, continue to lag.

Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas said the appliance category is "probably the most difficult one that we have in the market today." He said historically, the company has sold new premium appliances and sets of appliances. 

With the slower housing market, he said the company is seeing more shoppers replace a product that's broken rather than buy a washer and dryer pair, and promotions haven't been as effective. To speed up sales, Best Buy plans to increase its labor in the department, speed up deliveries to better compete with rivals and even make some items available same day, he said.

"And hopefully as housing and different things change, then the market starts to swing back to something that might be a little bit more normal," he said.

In this article

The village of Caledonia, Wisconsin, sandwiched between Chicago and Milwaukee along Lake Michigan, is dotted with corn and soybean fields, single-story homes and traffic signs alerting drivers to horseback riders.

In September, when Microsoft, the world's third most-valuable company, sought to rezone 244 acres of agricultural land for a data center, 40 of the 49 people who spoke before the village's planning commission opposed the plan.

They worried about noise. They said air quality, already in violation of federal standards, could worsen. They feared electric bills might inflate and that few jobs would materialize, while Microsoft would continue to reap the rewards of the artificial intelligence boom.

"Why do we have to subsidize a company making billions of dollars a year?" resident Mike Kirchner asked at the meeting.

Nine days later, before Caledonia's top officials could vote on the proposal, Microsoft walked away. It pledged to find another location in the region, while expanding a separate AI data center 20 miles south, in the village of Mount Pleasant, where public outcry was proving to be less of an impediment.

Caledonia and Mount Pleasant both belong to Racine County, which consists of 18 small cities, towns and villages in the southeastern corner of Wisconsin. 

The two villages have very different dynamics. Half a decade ago, Mount Pleasant was supposed to be home to a giant facility for Taiwanese iPhone supplier Foxconn. It was a project with such ambitions that President Donald Trump, during his first administration, called it "the eighth wonder of the world" at a 2018 groundbreaking ceremony.

To clear the way for Foxconn, Mount Pleasant bought land, offering $50,000 an acre and 140% of appraised value for residents' homes, plus relocation costs, a village official said. Roads were paved, and water connections and electrical infrastructure installed.

But it was ultimately a high-priced failure. Foxconn eventually abandoned most of its plans, leaving a giant hole in the 800-plus acres of land that had been transferred to the manufacturer. In the eyes of many locals, Microsoft is filling that hole, and then some.

The contrasting scenarios in two Wisconsin villages, separated by mostly farmland and a smattering of churches and gas stations, underscores the obstacles facing the tech industry as it seeks to construct supersized data centers to house what's expected to be trillions of dollars worth of AI infrastructure. 

While large technology companies have maintained data centers in the U.S. for decades, there's a fresh urgency to open facilities packed with hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips and to cash in on the AI craze, spawned by the 2022 launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Power requirements measured in the gigawatts, pollution concerns, economic issues and political dynamics are just some of the friction points that can vary dramatically from one municipality to the next, making it virtually impossible to create a playbook for the handful of companies — Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta — leading the way.

Meanwhile, data centers don't tend to create a lot of long-lasting jobs. Brad Smith, Microsoft's vice chair and president, wrote in a blog post in September that the Mount Pleasant facility hired 3,000 construction workers at its peak and foresees 500 full-time employees, eventually growing to 800. McKinsey said in an August report that a 250,000-square-foot data center could employ 1,500 people during construction, but more than 50 for "steady-state operations," though additional jobs get created for other labor, like upgrading infrastructure.

Local pushback can present a major hurdle.

In August, the city council in Tucson, Arizona, voted to shelve an unnamed party's 290-acre data center proposal following objections from residents. In September, Google scrapped plans for a 470-acre site to be located in Indiana after protestors mounted signs that read "NO GOOGLE DATA CENTER," and voiced concerns about strains on the power grid and loss of farmland.

A month later, in its quarterly earnings report, Google parent Alphabet raised its capital expenditures forecast, saying it now expects to spend up to $93 billion in 2025 followed by a "significant increase" next year. Microsoft said that same day that capex growth would accelerate in fiscal 2026, which started in July, suggesting a minimum of about $94 billion, a number that's substantially higher when including leases.

With all of the hyperscalers laying out aggressive spending plans, Wisconsin and other states have lined up to offer incentives, such as extending tax breaks on sales of servers and networking switches. That partly reflects an effort to reestablish domestic industries after decades of economic erosion from the closing of factories and the rise of offshoring.

Wisconsin, once a hub for building auto parts and heavy equipment, has 22% fewer people working in manufacturing today than it did at the end of the 20th century, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2010, Chrysler closed its plant in Kenosha, just south of Caledonia.

A data center doesn't promise the kind of jobs needed for a vehicle production line, but it represents a connection to an emerging part of the economy and can offer hope to areas that have long been on the decline.

"The jobs Microsoft is paying are notably higher than the average wage in the region," said Dale Kooyenga, CEO of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce.

It's a pitch that was enticing enough for one village in Racine County, but not another.

The story starts in 2017, when Foxconn said it would build a $10 billion plant in Mount Pleasant for making flat-panel displays, with plans to create 13,000 jobs.

Mount Pleasant and Racine County told media outlets they were committing $764 million. Kelly Gallaher, Racine County's Democratic party chair, said borrowings approached $1 billion.

"For a town of 26,000 people, that's crazy, right?" she said in an interview.

By mid-2018, Foxconn was already scaling back its plans, first by deciding not to proceed with a "Generation 10.5" factory that could churn out screens of up to 75 inches in size, and instead targeting smaller components.

The company quickly downsized its hiring projections. Development was so slow that Bloomberg described the project as "disastrous" in 2019.

An amended contract signed in 2021 allowed for up to $80 million in state tax credits, down from the original $2.85 billion, in the event that Foxconn reached its new job creation goal of 1,454 by 2026. In 2023, the company said, it employed over 1,000 people in Wisconsin.

Mount Pleasant's finances sagged under the pressure of the development. Between 2019 and 2022, the village lost $193 million to pay down debt for the project, as costs far outpaced tax revenue from Foxconn, according to financial reports. And the city of Racine, which supplies water to the village, wasn't getting much economic activity in return, leading to a legal skirmish between the municipalities.

Then came the AI blitz.

OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022. The chatbot took off immediately and set in motion a torrent of investment in generative AI. Microsoft, OpenAI's lead backer and dealer of computing power, needed more capacity.

In addition to enlisting third-party providers like CoreWeave, Microsoft sought out land. The company found Mount Pleasant, and in 2023 revealed plans for a 315-acre campus.

In May 2024, President Joe Biden visited Wisconsin to promote the home of the planned $3.3 billion data center. Microsoft's Smith, who spent some of his childhood in Mount Pleasant, said the facility would create manufacturing jobs around the state.

And while it wouldn't bring 13,000 jobs, as Foxconn had promised, Smith said, "We will train over 100,000 people in Wisconsin by the end of the decade so they have the AI skills to fill the jobs of tomorrow."

Microsoft's arrival was "kind of a bit of a silver lining in what was basically a shameful story," Gallaher said.

In 2023, Gallaher had mounted a campaign to try and unseat Dave DeGroot as Mount Pleasant village board president, blaming incumbents for the Foxconn misadventure. But in the election that April, a week after Microsoft's announcement, DeGroot was victorious. He didn't respond to a request for comment.

While Microsoft's plans received a hefty dose of local support from residents fed up with the Foxconn fallout, environmentalists have been vocal.

A nonprofit called Midwest Environmental Advocates sued the city of Racine in September for information on water use, a month after conservation group Alliance for the Great Lakes published a report showing that "a single hyperscale data center can use more than 365 million gallons of water a year, equivalent to what 12,000 Americans use in that time."

The city responded that Microsoft's facility would use up to 8.4 million gallons per year.

In February, residents of neighboring Kenosha County protested plans for a natural gas plant in the town of Paris, six miles from the Microsoft site, saying air quality would worsen and bring health problems.

"Hope this doesn't become some sort of an AI hub," Jonathan Barker, one of the protesters, said in an interview. Barker is a former pastor of Kenosha's Grace Lutheran Church, a 20-minute drive from the Paris plant. He said rate increases from We Energies, which provides electricity to over 1 million Wisconsin customers, could be overwhelming to those on fixed incomes.

Smith has tried to reassure locals. At a September town hall meeting in Racine, he stressed that Microsoft wasn't about to drain Lake Michigan. He promised citizens that their electric bills won't spike because of the company's presence.

If anything, residents should prepare to see the project expand, Smith said in an interview from a balcony at the data center, which will house two stories of AI chips.

"We bought a lot more land than one would need if the only thing we can build is two of these," Smith said.

The company paid $1.9 million in property taxes to Mount Pleasant in 2025, with a larger sum to follow in 2026, as its first data center comes online. The second is set to open by 2028. 

Next, Microsoft went north.

Caledonia is more rural than Mount Pleasant, with more expansive lots, fewer homes and businesses, and almost 30 miles of horseback riding trails that cross property lines.

Microsoft plotted out land just west of We Energies' 610-megawatt Oak Creek coal plant, which opened beside Lake Michigan in the 1950s. We Energies buried coal ash around the plant, and in 2009 it reported elevated levels of the chemical element molybdenum in nearby private wells. The utility bought over 100 acres to form a buffer around the plant.

In July, Caledonia sent letters to those in close proximity to the property that Microsoft was pursuing, though without mentioning the company's name, about a potential rezoning. Prescott Balch, a retired U.S. Bank technology executive living in Caledonia, estimated that roughly 100 homes sit within a mile of the site. The difference in Mount Pleasant is that the nearby homes had been cleared years earlier to make way for Foxconn.

Along with the letters, Caledonia scheduled a planning commission meeting to discuss rezoning that would allow for "future development of high-quality, low-traffic light industrial development, i.e., data center."

Valerie Lancelle never received a letter. She learned about the issue from signs she noticed while driving to the gym one morning in July. The signs were from the village. "Zoning Change Requested," they stated.

Lancelle, a 20-year veteran of U.S. Bank and a Caledonia resident, turned to community Facebook groups.

"I'm like, 'Hey, does anybody know about this? What's going on? This is a problem. I'm a little worried,'" she recalled. She reconnected with Balch, whom she'd worked with until his retirement in 2023.

Lancelle attended the planning commission meeting in late July. All 21 people who spoke up were opposed to the development or had questions, according to minutes from the session.

The next day, residents launched a Facebook group called "Caledonia Residents against rezoning on Botting Road." It grew to encompass hundreds of members.

When CNBC visited Wisconsin in September to see the Mount Pleasant data center, tension was palpable in Caledonia. A lawn sign read "DATA CENTER" inside a red circle with a line through it. A man living on the property declined to give his name but said he wouldn't want a data center using water designated for the village.

At the time, Microsoft's involvement hadn't been made public. The proposal was just called Project Nova. 

"People had been asking me who it was, and I was saying, 'I don't think it's Microsoft,' because I believe that when they went to Mount Pleasant, it was openly Microsoft right from the outset," said Fran Martin, a Caledonia trustee. "I thought it was unlikely that it was Microsoft, because why would they be so open in that situation, and not simply, you know, come to Caledonia with the same openness or transparency? I still don't understand it."

Microsoft went public with its plans on Sept. 23, at a village board meeting. The Racine County Economic Development Corporation and an engineering firm gave presentations on Project Nova. A director for the economic development group said Microsoft was looking at 50 to 200 permanent Caledonia jobs.

Diann Strom, a Microsoft regional manager based in the company's home state of Washington, showed a slide titled "Microsoft data centers in your community," followed by 11 slides detailing how the company professes to foster prosperity and act as a "good neighbor" when it arrives in a new location. Strom said Microsoft intended to pay its own way for electricity.

"Our water demands are modest compared to other large industrial water users," she told attendees.

Despite the assurances, 32 out of 34 people spoke against Microsoft's plans.

The next day, Microsoft held an information session at Caledonia Village Hall. Five days later, the planning commission convened at the same place to vote on whether to recommend the rezoning. The crowd spilled out into the lobby, Lancelle said.

Some speakers expressed concerns about the potential environmental impact. Others worried about finances, the risk of relying too heavily on one taxpayer and how the data center buildings could be used if Microsoft were to abandon them.

Balch, who said he spent much of his career building software for data centers, had prepared many of the attendees' talking points.

"This is strange bedfellows for me, politically," he said. "I'm the last person that you would expect to be opposed to a data center."

Caledonia favored Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Balch, who calls himself fiercely independent, said he figured that his best shot at persuading the village board was to advance economic arguments, rather than concentrate on the environment.

He did have personal concerns.

"Horses are skittish animals," he said. "They're run-first, ask-questions-later animals. They would have had a miserable experience. I would have even contemplated moving because their lives would have been just unpleasant, given how fearful they are of strange noises and sounds and sights."

At the hearing, Balch advised planning commissioners to pause.

"The property and AI demand will still be there when the plan is ready," he told them. "And Microsoft isn't anywhere near ready to build anyway."

Martin took her turn at the mic and slammed officials for a lack of transparency.

"When you're asking us to make a decision as momentous as this and you don't choose to involve us in the process at all, I find that difficult," she said. In fact, Microsoft said it reached out directly to Caledonia village staff members in August and subsequently met with them weekly.

Despite the pressure, Microsoft managed to win rezoning support from five of the village's seven planning commissioners. The company's employees then checked in with trustees of the village board. The sentiment wasn't all favorable.

"They may have walked out of there going, 'Do we want to take the chance of being voted down?'" said one trustee, Nancy Pierce.

Microsoft pulled out the next week, before the matter came before the village board.

In a statement to The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Microsoft said, "Based on the community feedback we heard, we have chosen not to move forward with this site."

Balch said he, Martin and Pierce shared hugs and high fives at a park.

"We did seem to have awoken a sleeping giant, I guess," Martin said.

Bowen Wallace, Microsoft's corporate vice president of data centers in the Americas region, said in a statement that the company is "committed to being a good neighbor in the communities where we operate." 

Microsoft understands "the importance of hearing and responding to local concerns, and will use the learnings from our experience in Caledonia moving forward," Wallace said.

Andrew Chien, a computer science professor at the University of Chicago and a former Intel research executive, said "structural" challenges are apparent in many places where tech companies try to build.

Most of the jobs are temporary, while resource needs and environmental impact will go on for many years, so companies must find ways to be part of the community, protecting residents from rising utility prices and offering job retraining programs, Chien said. That's very different from how the tech industry is used to operating, he added.

"Traditional Silicon Valley culture is, go fast and scale without regard to human communities," he said. "That has to change. Long-term win-wins need to be constructed."

Dramas are unfolding across Wisconsin.

Last year in Beaver Dam, a small city northwest of Milwaukee, the Common Council signed an agreement backing the annexing and rezoning of an 830-acre site. The project was codenamed Degas LLC.

Only later did the council say it was the site of a possible data center. Anger spread on Facebook. Earlier this month, about 100 people showed up at a council meeting, where attendees each had two minutes to lodge complaints.

"You should all be ashamed of yourselves," one person called out.

Crews have already broken ground, leaving rocks and rubble in the road for vehicles to dodge, said Joey Larson, a midwife in Beaver Dam who joined the meeting virtually.

"Honestly, if we knew that this was going here, we never would have bought here," she said.

Earlier this month Meta published a blog post outing itself as the company behind Degas LLC, confirming locals' suspicions. The company promised over 100 "operational jobs."

Outside Madison, Blackstone-owned developer QTS Realty Trust is aiming to build a data center in the village of DeForest. QTS wants to buy land in the nearby town of Vienna. DeForest received a petition to annex 1,135 acres from Vienna, but Vienna's town board voted 4-0 to reject a cooperation agreement with the developer, after 22 people spoke in opposition to the arrangement.

Shawn Haney, a former sheriff's lieutenant in Vienna, said locals are worried about energy and water consumption, and whether it's "going to be like the dot-com bubble of years ago."

In October, the lakeside city of Port Washington, 26 miles north of Milwaukee, was identified as a site for OpenAI and Oracle as part of their Stargate effort. Over 1,000 opponents signed a petition to have the city obtain voter approval before entering into tax deals worth more than $10 million. A joint review board went ahead with a deal anyway.

"This just did not receive any sort of substantial input from the community," said Christine Le Jeune, a PhD student at the University of Florida who lives in Port Washington.

In flyers distributed to city households, data center firm Vantage promised 330 full-time jobs after construction. The company said electric bills wouldn't go up for the site, which would rely on renewable sources for 70% of its energy needs.

On Nov. 10, the city of Janesville, two counties west of Racine, said it would conduct due diligence on a proposal to redevelop the grounds of a former General Motors plant for an $8 billion data center that would consume up to 800 megawatts of power.

Unhappy locals are aiming to collect signatures from 4,000 homeowners and renters in the city of about 66,000 to require a referendum for any structure at the old plant that would cost over $450 million. 

And what's next for Microsoft? Even after the failure at Caledonia, the company said it wanted to keep working with the village and Racine County officials as it selects a new location.

At its information session, Microsoft had displayed posters for the public to examine. One listed the steps the company takes before turning on a data center, including construction. Cast in bold at the bottom were the words, "It's a marathon, not a sprint."

An election in April 2026 could change the composition of the village board, opening up the possibility of a new Microsoft proposal. Balch said he plans to run for a board seat.

"We never were hellbent on no data center anywhere, and we won't be if they pick another location," Balch said. "But the devil's in the details."

The average NHL team is now worth $2.2 billion, according to CNBC's Official NHL Team Valuations, 15% more than last year, as richer national media rights deals drive up franchise values. 

In April, the NHL and Rogers Communications agreed to a 12-year national Canadian media rights deal worth $7.79 billion, based on exchange rates as of Nov. 24, that will begin with the 2026-27 season. It is more than twice the amount the league is getting from its existing 12-year deal with Rogers.

The league's current U.S. national media rights deals with Walt Disney and Warner Brothers Discovery, which are worth a combined annual average of $630 million through the 2027-28 season, are also expected to see a big increase in the next cycle. "The next U.S. rights deal for the NHL should approach a doubling," said Lee Berke, CEO of LHB Sports, Entertainment & Media, whose firm advises teams and leagues on media deals. "Sports rights move the needle for distributors, subscribers and viewers."

During the 2024-25 season, revenue increased to an average of $243 million for the league's 32 teams, 9% higher than the previous season. Over the same time span, EBITDA — or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — rose 20%, to an average of $54 million per team.

Revenue from national media rights is split evenly among the league's teams, with increases in national media rights proportionally benefiting low-revenue teams more than high-revenue teams. This is one of the reasons the 16 teams that posted the lowest revenue for the 2024-25 season increased, on average, 19% in value during the past year compared with 14% for the 16 teams that had the highest revenue.

But teams with great arena economics and rich local television deals still dominate the top of our NHL valuations, because during the regular season the teams keep all the money from these revenue streams.

The most valuable team remains the Toronto Maple Leafs, worth $4.3 billion. The Leafs took in $130 million in net gate revenue last season, second-most in the league, according to internal NHL reports obtained by CNBC. The Maple Leafs also earn about $45 million a year from the local media rights deal with Rogers, the third-most in the NHL. The Leafs' next deal is expected to increase to around $55 million a year, which would place the team behind only the Montreal Canadiens.

The New York Rangers are valued at $3.8 billion, second-most in the league, despite taking an 18% haircut to their local television rights to $35 million for the year ending June 2026, as a result of an MSG Networks debt restructuring. But the Rangers raked in the most regular-season net gate receipts by a mile last season, at $179 million. Over the past four seasons, the Rangers earned $615 million from regular-season gate receipts — $152 million more than the Maple Leafs, who earned the second-most.

The Canadiens hold on to the third spot in the annual rankings, with a value of $3.4 billion. The team in October announced the signing of a new local media rights deal with Bell Media for both English- and French-language channels. It will pay the team a league-leading annual average of $70 million to $75 million beginning next season. 

The Edmonton Oilers leapfrogged the Boston Bruins to become the fifth-most-valuable team, and are now worth $3.1 billion. The Oilers have hockey's biggest superstar in Connor McDavid and were in the Stanley Cup Final the past two seasons. Not only did the Oilers post a record year across all revenue verticals, including sponsorships, premium seating, food and beverage, and merchandise during the 2024-25 season, they began a new local television deal with Rogers this season that could pay the team well over $50 million annually, depending on advertising revenue.

Here is how the NHL's 32 teams stack up:

CNBC's Official NHL Team Valuations are current enterprise values — equity plus net debt — calculated using revenue multiples, and include the economics of the team's arena, including non-NHL revenue that accrues to the team's owner. The valuations do not include the value of stadium real estate.

Revenue figures are net of revenue sharing and the 35% of home playoff non-premium gate revenue that goes toward the revenue-sharing pool. Revenue multiples are based on historical control transaction prices, as well as what investors, league executives and bankers say about the market. Purchase prices are for control stakes and take into account payment structure and the value of a deal over time.

CNBC values exclude other businesses related to the teams with separate financial statements, such as the Edmonton Oilers' mixed-use real estate project. For teams that sell their own merchandise, such as the Oilers, CNBC deducts the cost of goods sold from merchandise sales. Likewise, CNBC excludes the market value of affiliates/equity method investments to ensure consistent enterprise value-to-revenue and enterprise value-to-EBITDA multiples. Debt figures are the latest available and include both team debt and stadium debt.

Valuations are based on a team's current arena, unless there is an agreement in place for the team to move or get a new arena. Values are adjusted for teams whose stadium economics are going to improve soon, such as the Calgary Flames, who are scheduled to move into a new arena for the 2027-28 season, and the Washington Capitals, whose arena project is also scheduled to be completed for the 2027-28 season. Likewise, CNBC valuations anticipate a substantial increase in the NHL's next U.S. national broadcasting deal, which would begin with the 2028-29 season.

Revenue and EBITDA figures are for the 2024-25 season and net of revenue sharing and player escrow. CNBC presents revenue and operating income figures on a cash basis, rather than an accrual basis. CNBC figures are different from the league's official hockey-related revenue because we include non-NHL arena revenue that goes to the teams. When the owner of the arena also owns both the NHL team and NBA team that play in the arena — as is the case for Toronto's Maple Leafs and Raptors, the Colorado Avalanche and Denver Nuggets, and Utah's Mammoth and Jazz, among others — we divide revenue from non-sports events held at the arena evenly between the two teams.

All valuation figures are in U.S. dollars and are based on a one-year average exchange rate, from June 2024 to June 2025, of CA$1 = US$0.72.

Sources for CNBC's Official NHL Team Valuations include team owners, investors and executives, as well as sports bankers and league consultants; public documents such as stadium lease agreements, stadium authority budget audits and credit rating reports; and sponsorship and broadcasting industry executives. Certain figures were provided by league executives who spoke to CNBC on the condition of anonymity because agreements are private and they do not have permission to speak about them publicly.

Figures that could not be confirmed with sources are CNBC estimates. Some figures used in the calculation of values may be approximate.

Huge price declines aren't anything new for bitcoin investors. The highly volatile digital asset tends to serve as a proxy for risk appetite and liquidity, plunging when investors become cautious over macroeconomic or market risks. 

But bitcoin's current pullback, which now amounts to more than 30% from its recent all-time high, is different than prior declines, and could be more difficult to recover from, Deutsche Bank analysts wrote on Monday.

Deutsche Bank cited a couple of factors that distinguish the current bear market. 

"Unlike prior crashes, driven primarily by retail speculation, this year's downturn has occurred amid substantial institutional participation, policy developments, and global macro trends."

The first big thing the bank flags is that adoption is stalling. According to the bank, crypto usage is down to 15% of retail traders from 17% this summer.

This is important because steadily widening adoption and use of bitcoin is one of the fundamental drivers behind its bull case.

"The crypto's underperformance also resurfaces our 'Tinkerbell effect' theory that Bitcoin's valuations depend partly on belief-driven adoption," analyst Marion Laboure wrote on Monday. "During this correction, the 'Tinkerbell effect' is prevalent as sentiment-driven selling has reinforced the price decline."

The second reason the latest plunge could be different is that institutional investors are now exposed to bitcoin through ETFs. The first bitcoin ETFs were approved in January 2024, which kicked off a 600% rally in the asset. This is the first decline of at least 30% in bitcoin's price since the funds began trading. 

While institutional participation has boosted gains over the last couple of years, it's that very same exposure to bitcoin that has also now contributed to a feedback loop of falling liquidity and heightened selling, DB said.

All of this means it could be tougher for the apex cryptocurrency to pull itself out of its latest slump. 

"Thinning liquidity across Bitcoin order books has limited the crypto's ability to significantly recover from macro headwinds," Deutsche Bank wrote. "Whether Bitcoin stabilizes after this correction remains uncertain," Laboure added. 

She continued: "Looking ahead, Bitcoin's maturation will likely continue in phases. Greater regulatory clarity — especially from recent crypto market structure reforms — could support institutional confidence, while the adoption of stablecoins by major institutions may bolster market liquidity."

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants employees to use AI whenever they can — and he insists they shouldn't worry about losing their jobs in the process.

In an all-hands meeting on Thursday, the day after the chipmaker reported record earnings, Huang responded to a question about managers instructing employees to use AI less.

"My understanding is Nvidia has some managers who are telling their people to use less AI," he said at the meeting, which Business Insider listened to. "Are you insane?"

Huang said he strongly disapproved.

"I want every task that is possible to be automated with artificial intelligence to be automated with artificial intelligence," he said. "I promise you, you will have work to do."

Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today.

Nvidia isn't alone, as tech giants have taken measures to push employees to incorporate more AI into their day-to-day work. Both Microsoft and Meta plan to evaluate employees based on their AI usage, and Google told engineers to use AI for coding, Business Insider reported. Amazon was in talks to adopt the AI coding assistant Cursor after employees requested it, according to Business Insider's reporting.

Huang also said Nvidia's software engineers use Cursor. And if AI does not work for a specific task, "use it until it does," he added. "Jump in and help make it better, because we have the power to do so."

Though fear of job loss has been a constant drumbeat amid the rise of AI, Huang suggested Nvidia employees shouldn't worry. He said that while other tech companies have conducted layoffs, Nvidia had hired "several thousand" people last quarter, which he joked was putting a strain on office parking spaces. He added that hiring is still ramping up.

"Frankly, I think we're probably still about 10,000 short," Huang said, "but the pace at which we hire should be consistent with the pace at which we can integrate and harmonize the new employees."

Nvidia has significantly expanded its workforce, increasing from 29,600 employees at the end of fiscal 2024 to 36,000 employees at the end of fiscal 2025.

As Nvidia grows, its physical footprint is expanding. Huang said at the meeting that the company has recently moved into new offices in Taipei and Shanghai and is constructing two additional sites in the US.

Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of over $4 trillion. The company reported last Wednesday that it generated $57.01 billion in revenue in the last quarter, up 62% from the same period last year.

Recently, investor Michael Burry of "The Big Short" has been taking aim at Nvidia, voicing skepticism about the AI boom. Nvidia pushed back on these criticisms in a memo to Wall Street analysts, Business Insider reported Monday.

Paxos announced the acquisition of Fordefi which provides custody and wallet technology, without disclosing the deal terms. The technology includes multi-party computation (MPC) wallet architecture, which splits private keys into fragments and has become an industry standard. Fordefi's technology is used by many leading brands in the digital asset space including Figment, Pantera, Republic, Starkware and Wintermute. Paxos is the issuer of the PayPal and Global Dollar stablecoins, and also provides crypto brokerage services with PayPal as a high profile client.

Having provided digital asset custody services for a decade, the stablecoin issuer is a New York regulated trust and has applied for a national trust charter. The management concluded that it needed to provide more options to its clients.

“Fordefi has built an impressive stack and customer base founded on easy-to-use APIs and seamless web3 connectivity. Market participants require a regulated platform partner that meets their range of complex custody needs,” said Charles Cascarilla, CEO and co-Founder of Paxos. “Together, Paxos and Fordefi provide customers with a world-class custody solution built upon advanced wallet technology and regulated, qualified custody.”

If these doldrums give way to outflows, there could be a real problem.

Stablecoins are the crypto sector's cash equivalent asset of choice. Typically backed by fiat currency accounts and supported by smart contracts that maintain the coin's price stability, these coins serve specialized purposes in the cryptocurrency world. For most investors, they serve as the bridge between bank accounts and blockchains. However, after climbing steadily for the last couple of years and surging through the third quarter of 2025, the total stablecoin market cap is now near $300 billion and has slipped by roughly 1.5% over the last 30 days.

A market that was gushing new on-chain dollars is suddenly just idling, and that could be a problem for Ethereum (ETH 2.67%), as more than half of those stablecoins live on that blockchain. Let's unpack how serious this trend losing steam might be, and what investors should do about it.

Image source: Getty Images.

As you doubtlessly know, investors use stablecoins as a medium of exchange between crypto positions, as settlement rails for payments, and as the base currency for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications like lending and trading. Their value accounts for a bit under 10% of the roughly $3.1 trillion total crypto market value.

In Q3 2025 alone, the total stablecoin value across all blockchains surged by more than $44 billion. But in late November, the combined market cap of all stablecoins appears to be going into reverse after a multiyear spree of robust expansion. In other words, the stream of new dollar equivalents flowing into crypto has gone from a gush to a trickle, at least for now; it's presently unclear precisely what is driving the sharp falloff, but it could be as simple as elevated macroeconomic uncertainty.

Ethereum and its massive DeFi ecosystem are uniquely exposed to stablecoin flows, as it's the crypto sector's single largest venue for those assets to generate a yield or be exchanged for any one of a plethora of other assets on the network. It currently has roughly $165 billion worth of stablecoin tokens circulating on its chain, down 1.6% in the last 30 days. That stablecoin value is a big part of the reason why Ethereum's DeFi total value locked (TVL) is $68.9 billion, the largest in all of crypto.

Ideally, rising stablecoin balances on Ethereum would keep attracting new users, developers of decentralized applications (dApps), and fees. Hence, when the total stablecoin market cap stops growing, most of the slowdown is felt in Ethereum's neighborhood.

For Ethereum, the risk scenario is that if the total stablecoin market cap stagnates or shrinks for a year or two, fewer new dollars will arrive on the chain. That would be quite bearish.

Its DeFi platforms might see slower growth in collateral and activity. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization projects would have to fight harder to raise funding. And less Ether would be burned or otherwise expended via gas fees. In a nutshell, it would mean the part of its investment thesis that assumes a constantly expanding pool of on-chain cash would (perhaps only temporarily) weaken, even as the core technology continues to improve.

A decline in Ethereum's price in such a situation would be very probable, and much to the chagrin of the coin's investors, it might be a fierce one. On the other hand, there are still solid reasons to see the recent stall as a pause rather than the start of a slide.

The structural forces behind stablecoins remain fairly strong, with regulatory frameworks finally taking shape in the U.S. with the passage of the GENIUS Act. Furthermore, tokenized U.S. Treasury products are gaining traction, which is important because they're another type of cash equivalent.

If stablecoin value stops rising but on-chain Treasury bill value accelerates, the combined movements could ultimately continue the trend of more dollar-backed assets entering Ethereum (net of outflows). In turn, that bullish effect should prevent Ethereum's price from falling much (or at all). Thus, the base case here is that stablecoin growth resumes (and Treasury growth accelerates) once the broader crypto market digests its recent volatility.

So, it's pretty clear that declining stablecoin value is a yellow flag, even if it isn't a reason to rush to sell Ethereum. If, over the next two to six months, stablecoin market cap resumes a clear uptrend and Ethereum maintains or expands its dominance, the current outflows will be forgotten as a tiny blip, and today's worries will have aged poorly. If, instead, the sector grinds sideways while Ethereum cedes its share to faster or more specialized competitors, that would be a genuine signal to revisit the coin's investment thesis and perhaps reallocate your capital.

Until then, keep an eye on the stablecoin market, as it's a big predictor of where the on-chain action is going to be -- assuming it's going to happen at all, that is.

Billions in forced liquidations have swept through crypto markets in Q4. Here are the major liquidation clusters on perpetuals protocol Hyperliquid where leverage may unwind.  

Since October, bitcoin has ranged from above $126,000 to as low as $80,500, while the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency, ethereum, rose to nearly $4,900 in August before dropping to a low of $2,800 this month.

The volatility powered massive wipeouts in leveraged positions, with October 10 taking the crown for the largest liquidation event ever in a 24-hour period.

Liquidations occur when a trading platform's risk engine forcibly closes a trader's leveraged position because an asset's price reaches a certain level and their margin account balance is insufficient to cover the open position. 

A handful of liquidated positions barely moves the market, but if thousands of positions with similar liquidation prices are closed, the effect on the asset's market price can be substantial. 

“Market buy and sell orders triggered by liquidations can cause rapid price movements, leading to a ‘cascading effect' where more nearby positions get liquidated,” Coinglass explains.

These levels matter for non-leveraged investors, too. Large liquidation clusters can create abrupt spikes or drops that bleed into spot markets, revealing where crypto prices may snap lower or higher. 

As data on these liquidation levels from centralized exchanges like Coinbase is not public, we'll focus on data from crypto perpetuals protocol Hyperliquid, which is all on-chain and therefore transparent. 

There is a lot of money riding on different positions in bitcoin. Let's look at what happens if the asset keeps falling or if it manages to reverse and rally.

$63,875: 668.29 BTC positions or $58 million will be liquidated at the specific price. In total, the move down to $63,875 results in the liquidation of 5,630 BTC worth of leveraged long positions, or $489 million. 

$73,557: 537.83 BTC positions or $46.7 million will be liquidated at the specific price. In total, the move down to $73,557 results in the liquidation of 3,500 BTC worth of leveraged long positions, or $304 million.

$78,617: 621.21 BTC positions or $54 million will be liquidated at the specific price. In total, the move down to $78,617 results in the liquidation of 1,880 BTC worth of leveraged long positions, or $163.3 million. 

“For the downside: we see a large build up of puts on the $80/$75K strikes for the 5 DEC expiry, so it checks out traders are buying insurance if BTC breaks through this support,” according to Sean Dawson, core contributor and head of research at on-chain trading platform Derive.

$94,354: 747.05 BTC positions or $64.9 million will be liquidated at the specific price. In total, the move up to $94,354 results in the liquidation of 1,640 BTC worth of leveraged short positions, or $142.4 million. “We have moderate build up of calls on the $90K, but far larger spikes at $100/$110K strikes,” Dawson told Sherwood News. “If BTC rallies, traders are betting we hit the 6+ figure and probably surpass it.”

$95,123: 1,140 BTC positions or $99 million will be liquidated at the specific price. In total, the move up to $95,123 results in the liquidation of 3,200 BTC worth of leveraged short positions, or $277.9 million.

$98,356: 495 BTC positions or $43 million will be liquidated at the specific price. In total, the move up to $98,356 results in the liquidation of 3,920 BTC worth of leveraged short positions, or $340.5 million. 

$112,005: 595.68 BTC positions or $51.7 million will be liquidated at the specific price. In total, the move up to $112,005 results in the liquidation of 6,460 BTC worth of leveraged short positions, or $561 million. 

$114,295: 455.08 BTC positions or $39.5 million will be liquidated at the specific price. In total, the move up to $114,295 results in the liquidation of 7,080 BTC worth of leveraged short positions, or $615 million. 

For ethereum longs, the largest liquidation band sits around the $2,300 and $2,400 levels. A drop to $2,327 would liquidate 15,000 ethereum tokens' worth of positions, or $43.5 million, on Hyperliquid. In total, the full move down to $2,327 would wipe out 113,180 ethereum tokens' worth of leveraged long positions, or $328.7 million, data from the crypto derivative platform Coinglass shows.

Nicolai Søndergaard, research analyst at blockchain analytics firm Nansen, echoed a similar sentiment. “For ETH, key levels from consensus seem to be around $2.4K-2.5K range as a bottom,” he told Sherwood. “These numbers also coincide with where puts seem mostly concentrated.”

For shorts, the key ceiling is under $4,000. A jump to $3,976 would liquidate 39,360 ethereum tokens' worth of positions, or $114.3 million, while the cumulative move up to $3,976 results in the liquidation of 80,390 ethereum tokens' worth of leveraged short positions, or $233.4 million. 

These price levels matter beyond Hyperliquid, because they act as a proxy for leverage across other centralized exchanges, which don't have publicly available data. Stress on one trading platform, whether on-chain or off-chain, can spill into the broader ecosystem. 

The liquidation event in October saw the price of bitcoin on Hyperliquid peak at $122,460 and fall down to a low of $100,837, a nearly 17.7% move, while ethereum traded at a high of $4,395 before going as low as $3,241, a 25% decrease. When price fluctuations trigger large scale liquidations on any venue, the forced buying and selling can spread into spot markets and become a market-wide swing, as shown during October's wipeout. 

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, the world's largest bitcoin fund, is heading for its worst month of outflows since it launched in January 2024. 

Investors have pulled over $2.3 billion (net) throughout November so far. The jitters come as bitcoin grapples with its worst downturn since 2022, when the entire crypto world shook following the fall of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX — bitcoin has dropped more than 40% from its October high as of Monday's close. 

With their soaring popularity redefining and legitimizing cryptocurrencies at an institutional level, spot bitcoin ETFs have become a key barometer of wider investor sentiment surrounding the digital currency — as well as risk assets more broadly.

Notably, spot bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust tend to see their inflows accelerate with rising prices, and amplify falling prices when outflows become dominant. Citi Research, cited by Bloomberg, found that this feedback loop sees a ~3.4% price drop for every $1 billion pulled out from bitcoin ETFs.

Bitcoin ETFs have seen $1.45 billion leave the funds this week so far.

The last time ethereum was below $3,000 was in July 2025, after a number of corporate firms had begun to roll out their ethereum treasury strategies.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is seeing “the longest Extreme Fear streak since the FTX collapse.”

The price of solana is trading around $140, more than 50% away from its all-time high set in January.

Cryptocurrency staking means locking up your coins to help run a blockchain and earn rewards. It's like putting your money to work. As Reuters explains, staking lets holders validate transactions on a proof-of-stake network and earn transaction fees or newly minted coins in return. From the user's perspective, staking is essentially “locking up” tokens to earn returns. In this guide, we'll explain how staking works!

Staking is the backbone of many modern cryptocurrencies. On networks like Ethereum, validators run nodes that confirm transactions. To be eligible, validators must stake (lock) coins as collateral. If they play by the rules, they earn rewards. If they cheat, they can lose their stake (slashing). The locked coins keep the network secure and honest. This is a powerful idea: you help secure a blockchain, and the blockchain pays you.

Staking also helps the environment. Unlike proof-of-work mining (which uses huge amounts of electricity), proof-of-stake networks are far more energy-efficient.

The rewards for staking is a hot Reddit topic. Rewards vary by coin and network. Generally, newer or smaller networks pay higher APYs to attract validators (sometimes 10-20% or more), while very large networks pay lower rates.

For example, Ethereum's staking rewards are around a 3-4% annual yield for validators. (Only about 30% of all ETH is staked – roughly 37 million ETH, worth tens of billions of dollars – so earning 3% on that is still a lot of crypto.) By contrast, some smaller networks like certain DeFi tokens or new blockchains might promise 10%+ APY to bootstrap security.

Compared to traditional finance, even a 3-5% yield is huge. For context, average U.S. savings accounts yield only about 0.40% APY today. If your crypto coins recover in value, staking can multiply your returns. But if your coins drop 20%, a 5% reward won't feel like a win. In other words, staking doesn't eliminate risk – it adds smart passive income potential on top of existing crypto risk.

Leonardo da Vinci famously said: “Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do.”

The previous section speaks on how staking rewards works. If you desire to do it, here's how:

Here are some of the top cryptocurrencies with a staking mechanisms:

Staking is not a guaranteed profit machine. You should be aware of:

Regulators are also eyeing staking. Stay informed about any legal developments in your country concerning cryptocurrencies and staking.

According to Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes, “It is the part of a wise man to keep himself today for tomorrow, and not to venture all his eggs in one basket.” 

Relating these words to passive earnings, it's best to diversify strategies. Besides staking, you could earn stocks, bonds, or rent real estate. Even crypto lending and yield farming exist.

In some countries, including New Zealand, users interested in digital assets often explore additional forms of entertainment and financial instruments that combine cryptocurrencies and analytics.

Among these options are thematic reviews of online casinos in New Zealand, which provide detailed analyses of platforms that allow the use of cryptocurrencies. This can be useful for those who want to understand how such services work and what conditions they offer before making a choice.

In the end, staking can be a smart, hands-off way to grow your crypto holdings. However, it's not magic. To make it a reliable source of passive income, you must understand how it works. This guide has put you on the right track. It's advisable to further your research before you stake your cryptocurrencies.

Klarna launches its first stablecoin, KlarnaUSD, built on Stripe's Tempo blockchain as the company enters crypto and targets cheaper global payments.

Global digital bank and flexible payments provider Klarna has announced the launch of its first stablecoin, KlarnaUSD. The move marks a major strategic shift for the company, whose CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, was previously one of the more outspoken critics of cryptocurrencies.

Klarna is now the first bank to issue a stablecoin on the new Tempo blockchain, a payments-focused network created by Stripe and Paradigm. The company says the initiative positions it to compete directly with long-standing payment networks as the stablecoin industry grows rapidly.

The announcement comes as stablecoin usage continues to surge. McKinsey estimates that annual stablecoin transaction volume already exceeds $27 trillion and could surpass traditional payment systems by the end of the decade. In October 2025, total stablecoin market capitalization crossed $300 billion for the first time.

Analysts estimate that cross-border payments alone generate around $120 billion in annual fees. Klarna believes stablecoins can dramatically reduce these costs for both consumers and businesses.

Siemiatkowski emphasized that Klarna's global scale and Tempo's infrastructure give the company a unique opportunity to challenge legacy systems.He stated:“With 114 million customers and $112 billion in annual GMV, Klarna has the scale to change payments globally. With Tempo's infrastructure, we can challenge legacy networks and make payments faster and cheaper for everyone.”

He added that crypto technology has reached a turning point:“Cryptocurrency has finally become fast, inexpensive, secure, and scalable. This is the beginning of Klarna's foray into crypto, and I'm excited to partner with Stripe and Tempo to help shape the future of payments.”

The new stablecoin is being built using Open Issuance by Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure developed by Stripe. KlarnaUSD is currently running on a testnet and is not available for public use, allowing the company to conduct extensive testing ahead of its planned Tempo mainnet launch in 2026.

The project also strengthens Klarna's existing strategic partnership with Stripe, which already powers payment processing for the company across 26 international markets.

The broader payments industry is rapidly adapting as well. Visa recently expanded support for stablecoins across four networks, while Western Union is testing its own stablecoin technology and plans to launch a branded stablecoin in the first half of 2026.

Interest in the asset class has also grown since US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act — the United States' first federal crypto law.

Bitcoin's risk-adjusted performance is hitting new lows, a level historically associated with market stress and risk repricing, according to new data.

The downturn comes as analysts warn of steeper losses amid growing concerns that the market's latest slide could deepen into a broader bear phase.

New CryptoQuant data  shows Bitcoin's Sharpe Ratio, a widely used gauge of risk-adjusted returns, has slipped back toward zero in recent days.

Analysts said the readings typically reflect periods of elevated uncertainty and weak return quality, often occurring during times of strong volatility.

“The Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio has collapsed back toward the zero line, a level historically associated with moments of maximum uncertainty and the early stages of risk repricing,” a CryptoQuant analyst said.

“Investors seeking optimal asymmetry typically find better conditions during these low-Sharpe phases than during high-Sharpe euphoric peaks,” the analyst wrote.

The analyst said this represents the essence of “contrarian investing, buying when the risk-adjusted math looks terrible in the rearview mirror but promising ahead.”

Bitcoin's Sharpe Ratio, which compares excess returns to volatility, has now retreated to levels that historically appear only every few years.

CryptoQuant noted that similar collapses in 2019, 2020, and 2022 preceded extended phases of risk repricing.

While the move does not signal a definitive bottom, analysts say compressed Sharpe levels tend to mark the early stages of improving forward returns, provided that price conditions stabilize.

However, analysts have urged traders to remain cautious.

CryptoQuant's analyst noted that “until the Sharpe Ratio starts turning upward, short-term noise can remain dominant, and positioning should be sized accordingly.”

“Bitcoin is not yet signaling trend recovery, but it is signaling that the risk-adjusted landscape is becoming more attractive for forward returns,” the analyst wrote.

The ratio's decline comes as fresh blockchain data suggests modest re-accumulation among some larger Bitcoin investors.

According to Santiment , the number of wallets holding at least 100 BTC has risen 0.47% since Nov. 11, adding 91 new mid-sized whale addresses.

The uptick comes after months of declining balances among the biggest holders, with wallets holding more than 1,000 BTC shrinking steadily.

At the time of reporting, Bitcoin was trading around $87,300, down nearly 5% over the past week.

CCN analyst Valdrin Tahiri said Bitcoin's long-term Elliott Wave structure points to a potentially extended correction phase after completing a multi-year advance.

According to Tahiri, Bitcoin has posted a clear five-wave upward movement since November 2022.

“Bitcoin has completed the fifth and final wave of its upward movement and is now correcting inside wave A of its A-B-C correction,” he wrote.

Tahiri's sub-wave analysis also indicates that the internal structure of the fifth wave has been fully completed, reinforcing the view that the market has shifted into corrective territory.

He noted that wave A is still developing and could push Bitcoin lower toward the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement support near $71,000.

Using this wave-based framework, Tahiri's method projects Bitcoin trading around $73,000 by the end of 2026 before potentially sliding to $57,000 by late 2027.

KuCoin secured registration with AUSTRAC, Australia's financial intelligence and regulatory agency, through its own Australian subsidiary, enabling the platform to legally operate digital currency exchange services in the country.

The registration allows KuCoin to introduce fiat on-ramps and expand crypto services for Australian users under local regulatory oversight.

Australia mandates AUSTRAC registration for digital currency exchanges to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. The regulatory framework requires offshore crypto platforms to align with existing financial services regulations.

In addition to AUSTRAC registration, KuCoin has partnered with Echuca Trading, an AFSL-licensed financial services provider, to bring its crypto futures business under a regulated structure tailored to the Australian market.

These steps enhance accessibility for Australian users while maintaining compliance with local regulatory requirements.

Collaboration Unites Transformational AI and Blockchain to Drive Innovation Across Regulated Industries Unlocking Market Opportunities

DALLAS, TX / ACCESS Newswire / November 25, 2025 / Messier 42 LLC ("M42"), a private leading global artificial intelligence technology and digital transformation company, announces that it has entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Constellation Network and DFNN Inc. to launch the world's first AI, Blockchain and Crypto ecosystem in the Philippines, merging the country's established regulated operations of Exchanges, Lotteries, Gaming, Capital Markets, Banking, and Online Trading with the power of Web3 technology and decentralized finance.

This groundbreaking initiative positions the Philippines as an innovative and forward-looking leader in blockchain-enabled regulated industries globally. In the Philippines, the lottery comprises over 45% of all gaming revenue while the Asia-Pacific region dominates the global lottery with a 38% market share. Furthermore, the Philippines ranks 4th in crypto adoption with nearly 13% of the population using crypto. The intersection of crypto and gaming presents a notable pathway to onboard new users while leveraging blockchain technology to set an example for responsible evolution of traditional markets in the digital age.

The Partnership

On the front end, the partnership will enable the purchase of regulated national lottery tickets with cryptocurrency. On the back end, the collaboration will unite M42's advanced Transformational AI platform with Constellation Network's Hypergraph Network, a decentralized framework that enables secure, scalable, and transparent data exchange across enterprise and Web3 environments. Constellation's native cryptocurrency, DAG, powers decentralized data validation and security functions within the network. Together, M42 and Constellation will partner with DFNN Group, one of the Philippines' leading technology companies which has regulated operations in lotteries, gaming, capital market, Exchanges, banking, payments and Online Trading, which will provide regulatory expertise and licensed operational infrastructure.

Unlocking a Global Opportunity

This combination of openness to adopt these new technologies for the various traditional industries and high crypto participation provides a unique environment for blockchain-driven innovation. The collaboration will explore compliant digital business models for processes, payments, transparency and ease of use, including envisioned crypto-enabled payments, transparent draws, and regulated cross-border participation.

"Our vision is to merge innovation with integrity," said Greg Lackland from M42. "This project will demonstrate how blockchain can enhance transparency, trust, and accessibility in real-world applications, starting with transparency in its various verticals such as lotteries, gaming, payments, and various Exchange Systems. We're excited to showcase how blockchain technology can modernize legacy industries while upholding trust and regulatory compliance, creating a model with global impact."

"What's exciting is that we're transforming traditional, centralized databases and networks into modern, secure systems," said Ben Jorgensen, CEO of Constellation Network. "Similar to our work with the Department of Defense, we're using Web3 technology to broaden participation in the digital economy, starting with familiar various operations currently running under the DFNN Groups various operations in Lotteries, Gaming, Capital markets and Payments. What we're building here serves as a blueprint that can be applied to similar established networks around the world.

"The Philippines has a rare combination of high crypto adoption, digital remittance infrastructure, and an openness to adopt AI & Blockchain Technologies," said Ramon Garcia Jr. from DFNN. "By uniting AI compliance with blockchain's capabilities, we can open the door to responsible, democratic financial inclusion across our various regulated operations.

U.S. spot altcoin exchange-traded funds posted daily inflows Monday, amid a broader crypto market selloff that has pushed overall sentiment into fearful territory.

Spot Solana ETFs have attracted $843.81 million in total net assets since their inception, noting $57.99 million in inflows on Monday, according to SoSoValue data. Likewise, spot XRP ETFs have raised $628.82 million, attracting a whopping $164.04 million in inflows on the same day.

This sustained demand stems from risk-management-based capital rotation and improved regulatory clarity, experts told Decrypt.

“This is a combination of selective investor interest and risk management,” Czhang Lin, head of LBank Labs, told Decrypt. It suggests many investors are holding for the long term, treating the current selloff as an opportunity rather than a signal to exit, Lin explained.

The divergence between altcoins is stark.

While Solana and XRP ETF products saw sustained daily inflows, CoinShares' weekly report highlights a key difference between the two. Solana saw $156 million in outflows last week, while XRP bucked the trend with $89 million in inflows.

“Solana has experienced technical and network challenges recently, which increases perceived risk,” the LBank Labs analyst said, explaining the discrepancy. “With XRP, however, it is benefiting from both institutional interest and regulatory optimism, making it more attractive for inflows.”

Franklin Templeton's spot XRP ETF, XRPZ, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange Arca on Monday, which is another reason for the discrepancy.

This contrasting dynamic is a hallmark of a cautious market.

“In the current risk-off environment, assets with clearer, less speculative narratives tend to hold up better,” Rachel Lin, CEO and Co-Founder of SynFutures, told Decrypt. “Investors are likely reallocating rather than simply abandoning crypto entirely.”

The success of these products is building a new pipeline for institutional capital.

“The newly regulated pathways for institutional capital via ETF products are like pipes that connect the massive reservoir of TradFi to the digital asset ecosystem,” Alexis Sirkia, Chairman of Yellow Network, told Decrypt.

The odds of a Federal Reserve rate cut have shot up to around 70%, according to CME's FedWatch tool over the weekend. Risk-on sentiment has improved, extending Bitcoin's weekend bounce into the week, per a previous Decrypt report.

Sentiment around the prospects of a rate cut is reflected in prediction market Myriad, owned by Decrypt's parent company Dastan, where users assign an 82% chance that the Fed would cut rates by a quarter point on December 10.

Still, the crypto market outlook remains delicate and heavily dependent on the Fed's interest rate decision on December 10.

“With the increasing odds of a December rate cut, there is potential for liquidity to flow back into risk assets, including altcoins,” said Rachel Lin.

However, she tempered expectations, noting that any rally would be selective. “I would expect this rally, if it happens, to be selective rather than broad-based,” Lin noted. “Altcoins with strong structural stories and institutional access have a good chance of outperforming into December, but it's not a guarantee of an across-the-board altseason.”

XRP is up 7.1% over the past 24 hours while Solana's performance hovers slightly lower, around 5.2%, according to CoinGecko data.

After a brief five-day rally, Bitcoin once again continued its downward plunge, losing another 1% between 7 p.m. ET last night and 6 a.m. this morning. It is at $87K at the time of writing. In large part, that reflected a general risk-off attitude across global markets this morning. S&P 500 futures were down 0.19% after the index closed up 1.55% yesterday. Asia was mixed this morning, and Europe followed by moving flat-to-down in early trading.

Crypto may be suffering from a significant shift in sentiment: Until Oct. 6 this year, Bitcoin and gold had moved up together, though certainly not in tandem. However, both rose on a “safe haven” narrative as stocks soared, despite worries that the tech companies driving them are fueling an AI bubble.

When the U.S. government shut down, both gold and Bitcoin hit record highs. Deutsche Bank analysts even argued that Bitcoin would soon be bought by global central banks as a new reserve asset on their balance sheets (even though crypto is “backed by nothing,” they said).

A month on, the “Bitcoin is digital gold” and thus a “store of value” argument is seemingly in tatters, as Bitcoin and gold have diverged. Gold is moving toward a new record high while “the crypto market's total capitalization has now fallen by about 24% (over $1 trillion) since its October peak,” according to a note by Deutsche Bank's Marion Laboure and Camilla Siazon shared yesterday.

Gold, by contrast, looks unstoppable. “Gold has just delivered its most extraordinary year in more than four decades. Prices surged more than 50% in 2025 so far, making it the metal's best performance since 1979,” according to ActivTrades analyst Carolane de Palmas.

First is that the Bitcoin ETF trade has seen a sharp unwinding over the past few days. When traditional finance platforms launched Bitcoin ETFs, there was a huge influx of interest, as retail investors (who previously may not have felt confident enough to create a crypto wallet) decided to enter the market. But with the price of Bitcoin plunging over the past 30 days, hundreds of millions of dollars have poured out of those ETFs, as this chart from Deutsche Bank shows:

“Every $1 billion that leaves a Bitcoin ETF pulls down the price of Bitcoin by 3.4%,” according to Alex Saunders at Citi Research.

The second major factor pushing up gold is, ironically, crypto. Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has become a buyer of gold on a scale comparable to central banks. Tether maintains USDT on a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar by backing each coin with the dollar equivalent in cash, bonds or—more recently—gold bullion. This year alone, Tether's gold buying is the equivalent of 12% of all central bank gold buying, according to Jefferies.

For crypto investors, stablecoins (as the name suggests) offer respite from the fluctuations of Bitcoin. So the more Bitcoin declines, the more crypto investors move into stablecoins like USDT while they await a turnaround, and the more gold gets bought to back those stablecoins—pushing up the price of the yellow metal. Thus begins a spiral that widens the divergence between gold and Bitcoin over time.

Here's a snapshot of the markets ahead of the opening bell in New York this morning:

The CBDC versus Cryptocurrency debate in India has been becoming critical, especially with the rapid growth seen in digital finance. India is studying new digital payment systems, reinforcing regulations, and assessing the long-term implications of digital assets. Among the big questions is how these two financial technologies- Central Bank Digital Currency and cryptocurrencies-will eventually shape the Indian banking ecosystem. Banks in India are already under pressure to become more innovative, understand the needs of digital-first customers, and conduct large-scale financial transactions in a secure manner. With CBDCs and cryptocurrencies continuing to attract this much attention, their impact on the sector cannot be ignored.

Hence, for understanding the impact thereof, a distinction between CBDC and cryptocurrency is necessary. For instance, a CBDC, which in this context can be said to be India's Digital Rupee, is basically a fiat currency in digital form but has been issued and is being governed by the RBI. It actually enjoys the same value, trust, and regulatory support as hard cash. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, operate on decentralized networks like blockchain without direct government control. Their value fluctuates according to market demand, global adoption, and investor interest.

While digital technology provides a base for both CBDCs and cryptocurrencies, the latter differ in purpose and structure. Essentially, that's the core of the wider CBDC-versus-cryptocurrency debate in India, which in turn portends the future of banks and financial institutions.

The introduction of the Digital Rupee is certain to revolutionize the way conventional banking is carried out. Among the key changes are those relating to the storage and transmission of money. Digital Rupee may allow individuals and companies to hold the currency directly with the RBI, using digital wallets, thereby being less dependent on commercial banks for such services. Transactions will be cheaper, and the settlements quicker.

This development hence presents banks with opportunities and challenges. Digital currency could minimize the expense of cash handling, improve transparency, and promote interbank settlements. The CBDC would, however, decrease customer deposits in cases where users decide it is preferable to hold CBDCs instead of continuing to hold money in bank accounts. This may lower the banks' lending capacity and thereby influence the interest rate and liquidity policies.

Cryptocurrencies are known for their decentralized control, efficiency in cross-border transactions, and investment opportunities. Even as the Indian government is circumspect about the rise of virtual currencies, the interest in cryptocurrencies continues to grow. Banks are limited, however, by the need to consider compliance requirements and regulatory uncertainty.

Since the trading in cryptocurrency happens outside the conventional banking framework, banks have no way to regulate its circulation. In these cases, monitoring the flows, combating financial crimes, and consumer protection are much more difficult. There is also a greater risk of cybersecurity for banks, as crypto-transactions cannot be undone.

However, the rise of crypto forced Indian banks to consider blockchain applications, digital asset custody, tokenized financial products, and faster rails for making payments. These innovations are representative of the way in which the banking sector is moving toward a technology-oriented future. The comparison of CBDC vs Cryptocurrency in India further outlines how banks must evolve to meet customer expectations of faster and safer experiences in more digitally enabled ways.

One of the most powerful arguments in favor of CBDCs is that of better financial stability. The Digital Rupee, being an issuance of and backed by the RBI, has very low volatility. Settlements using CBDCs enable banks to settle in real-time and thus avoid delays and operational risks. Also, CBDCs may allow the RBI to implement monetary policy more efficiently with real-time visibility over money flows.

With CBDCs, transactions for customers would be safer, more transparent, and cheaper. Conversely, cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile in value, hence not serving any beneficial purpose for ordinary day-to-day transactions. The difference in the case of CBDC vs. Cryptocurrency in India points toward possible usage of CBDCs as more favored media of exchange while keeping cryptocurrencies mainly as investment products.

Whereas both CBDCs and cryptocurrencies have impacts on how payments are transacted, they do so in very different ways. On one hand, CBDCs could find a home in the current payments infrastructure, possibly enabling real-time bank-to-bank transfers and making the need for an intermediary less relevant. Conversely, banks could be compelled to redesign their system of payments to fit the functionality of CBDCs. For instance, wallet integration, settlement interfaces, and customer authentication could be features that CBDCs might possess.

Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies force banks to rethink security, compliance, and risk management. Transfers via blockchain presses the traditional payment rails to compel banks to adapt more efficient technologies. Financial institutions that cannot adapt to these changes run the risk of losing relevance in a world just starting to move toward digital-first finance.

The aspect of CBDC versus cryptocurrency in India provides a pointer toward how the future of banking will blend regulated digital currency with decentralized innovation.

If CBDCs offer stability, then cryptocurrencies draw in those investors looking for growth and financial freedom. CBDCs will never fully replace cryptocurrencies because they serve different purposes, but easy-to-use CBDC wallets and government-backed security might cut down on small-scale crypto adoption.

If India launches a full-scale Digital Rupee, then some users will definitely abandon cryptocurrencies to meet their everyday payment needs. Still, investment-driven crypto activity will persist, particularly among the young, tech-savvy Indians who look at digital assets as part of the future economy. This ongoing debate on CBDC vs. Cryptocurrency in India has been actively molding investor behavior and regulatory frameworks.

The Indian banking sector stands at the threshold of modernization and regulation. CBDCs have the potential to strengthen financial infrastructure, modernize payments, and bring greater monetary control. While there is regulation on the use of cryptocurrencies, they indeed encourage technological evolution and open new opportunities for asset diversification.

Banks will need to be suitably equipped to respond to changing customer expectations, growing digital interoperability, and cybersecurity needs. All this will involve collaboration by regulators, banks, and fintech innovators. As India navigates the broader discussion of CBDC vs Cryptocurrency in India, the eventual outcome will depend upon how effectively banks balance innovation with stability and customer trust.

CBDCs are the digital currencies issued by the government and backed by the RBI, whereas cryptocurrencies represent decentralized digital currencies that are not controlled by any central authority.

Digital Rupee can ease ways of paying and settling, but it could mean a reduction in bank deposits if people start holding CBDC wallets instead of regular accounts.

There is no official ban; regulation, nonetheless, is strict. The focus is on monitoring the risks while allowing innovation.

No, CBDCs provide stability and official backing, whereas cryptocurrencies are for investment and decentralized alternatives.

Both have a role to play: CBDCs reinforce traditional banking and policy control, while cryptocurrencies promote innovation and diversification.

The whole concept of money in India is undergoing a sea change. Now, with the recent advent of CBDC, popularly known as Digital Rupee, and the increasing interest in cryptocurrency, one common question keeps popping up: what are the differences between these two forms of currency, CBDC and Cryptocurrency, and which one will shape India's financial future?

These are the two major types of digital currencies gaining attention in India. While CBDC is issued and controlled by the RBI, cryptocurrency is decentralized and works on no element of central authority. Both forms of digital money promise to assure speed, transparency, and global connectivity. They differ in their purpose, control, technology, and rules.

A CBDC is a digital form of cash issued by the central bank of any country. Digital Rupee was launched by the RBI in India to reduce the requirement for physical cash, increase the velocity of settlement of payments, and introduce efficiency in financial transaction processing overall.

Issued and controlled by the Reserve Bank of India

Legal tender of equal value to physical cash

Highly secure and, where necessary, traceable

Meant for daily payments, business transactions, and government services.

Supports both retail (public use) and wholesale (bank-to-bank) formats

The CBDC is not a private asset; it is no different than cash but in digital form.

Cryptocurrency is a blockchain-based digital asset. The most widespread cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. None of these coins are issued by any government, and their value depends on the demand for them in the market.

Key Features of Cryptocurrency

Decentralized - no central authority

Leveraging blockchain for complete transparency and security.

Can be used anywhere around the world without the need for banks.

Volatile by nature; prices shoot upwards or fall with rapidity. It can be used for trading, investment, and cross-border transactions.

The status of cryptocurrency will be as an asset in India, but it is not a legal currency.

India launched Digital Rupee for following strategic reasons:

India already has a strong electronic payment environment in the form of UPI, IMPS, and NEFT. CBDC simplifies digital payments and makes them quicker.

Printing, handling, and transportation of cash are costly. Digital Rupee reduces such costs.

CBDC transactions are traceable with adequate protection of privacy; therefore, they reduce fraud and circulation of black money.

It was only when crypto gained more momentum and became popular that the governments of different countries were compelled to take rapid initiatives in introducing their own versions of digital currencies that would guarantee security.

CBDCs can facilitate cross-border payments, making them faster and cheaper.

The Digital Rupee will work in two forms:

This is meant for the wide world; it functions just like digital cash in a wallet, which is provided by RBI-licensed banks.

For bank-to-bank transfers, securities, and other settlement processes.

How People Use It

Download the official CBDC wallet

Transfer funds from bank account to digital rupee wallet

Pay bills using QR codes

Use it offline in some pilot cities

A CBDC acts like cash-you don't need a bank account to send or receive it.

Cryptocurrencies are based on blockchains, in which all the transactions get publicly recorded and verified by a network of thousands of computers.

Key Elements

Wallet: It stores your crypto assets.

Blockchain: Public Ledger Nodes/miners: validate transactions

Exchanges: allow buying/selling of crypto Crypto enables a transaction between peers w/o some intermediary.

India's digital payment ecosystem is already one of the strongest in the world, thanks to UPI, which makes instant money transfers possible with just a mobile number or QR code. But the Digital Rupee (e₹) works very differently—even though both operate digitally.

Here's a simple breakdown:

UPI:

Not a currency.

It is a payment system that moves money between bank accounts.

Digital Rupee (CBDC):

It is money.

A digitally issued currency by the RBI, equivalent to physical cash.

UPI:

You need a bank balance.

UPI only transfers bank-held funds.

Digital Rupee:

Issued directly by the Reserve Bank of India.

Works like digital cash stored in your CBDC wallet.

UPI:

Debit from Bank A → Credit to Bank B.

Involves banks, NPCI, and settlement systems.

Digital Rupee:

Direct wallet-to-wallet transfer.

Acts like handing over cash digitally—no bank settlement needed.

UPI:

Free for consumers (banks bear infra cost).

Minor delays possible during peak load.

Digital Rupee:

Faster because it bypasses inter-bank settlement.

Lower transaction cost for the system.

UPI:

Needs internet.

Digital Rupee:

Offline payments possible, enabling transactions without network connectivity.

UPI:

Linked to bank account + KYC.

Digital Rupee:

Still requires KYC, but transactions can be more private, similar to cash.

The CBDC would be centralized, wherein RBI monitors and manages transactions. Crypto is decentralized. No government involvement.

It carries the same value as the Indian Rupee. Crypto prices are based on market speculation.

CBDC is fully regulated. Crypto faces stricter taxation, cautious regulations, and limited acceptance.

CBDC is to support the Indian economy. Crypto projects seek to create a borderless, fully global financial system.

It allows for controlled privacy, while any large or suspicious transactions are traceable with the CBDC. Crypto provides public but pseudonymous transactions.

CBDC: Retail Payments.Crypto: invest, trade, use dApps (DeFi, NFTs)

Safer Than Crypto- It is backed by RBI, so there is no risk of value crash.

Faster Payments Instant transfers- no bank or card required.

No Transaction Fees In Many Cases CBDC-  reduces the costs both for businesses and consumers.

Offline Payments Useful for villages and remote areas.

Supports Government Services- The direct benefit transfers, subsidy, refund of taxes, etc., turn agile and transparent.

Global Accessibility

You can send crypto anywhere, without banks.

Decentralization

Users are in control of their own money.

High Growth Potential

Some crypto investments can pay very high returns.

Innovation

Three of the changing digital services are smart contracts, NFTs, and DeFi.

Highly volatile

The risk of hacking, fraud, and loss.

Not legal tender in India

Heavily taxed: 30% gains tax plus 1% TDS.

Retail shopping

Business payments

P2P Transfers

Transfers of government benefits Transport and tolls payments Smart city integrations

The reason both systems behave differently can be explained by understanding the technologies behind CBDC and cryptocurrency.

It is based on the concept of a Centralized Digital Ledger, designed and fully controlled by and under the administration of the RBI. It may deploy permissioned blockchain, whereby only a few selected authorities are allowed to validate the transactions, such as banks, regulators, and RBI-approved institutions.

Key Characteristics:

High-speed settlement: The CBDC allows the settlement of payments within seconds.

Controlled access: only the authorized nodes are allowed to verify the transactions.

Energy consumption is low: This is because, unlike Bitcoin mining, CBDC does not require heavy computing power.

Programmability: The RBI could introduce features such as programmable payments-useful for subsidies or restricted-use tokens.

This will ensure stability, compliance, and seamless integration with the existing digital payment ecosystem in India.

It uses a decentralized blockchain, which verifies and records the transactions on thousands of computers around the world.

Key Characteristics:

Permissionless: anyone can subscribe to the network for transaction validation.

Public Ledger: All the transactions are publicly visible to all via the blockchain explorer.

Mining/Validation: Crypto employs either Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake, depending on the blockchain.

Smart Contracts: These automate actions when certain conditions are met.It's a system that serves many purposes offering transparency and freedom, though sometimes challenging issues of volatility or energy consumption, depending on the blockchain.

CBDC is expected to influence many layers in the economy of India, from banking and retail to government finance and cross-border trade.

CBDC would reduce dependence on traditional savings accounts, as one can store Digital Rupees in their CBDC wallets.

Possible outcomes:

This may result in offering higher interest rates to depositors by banks.

Faster settlements mean less bank fees and reduced delays in processing.

In a wholesale CBDC system, bank-to-bank transfers will be much more efficient.

CBDCs can make the operations of governments smoother, faster, and more transparent.

These include:

Quick distribution of subsidies

Elimination of fake beneficiaries

Reduced leakages in welfare schemes

Realtime tracking of fund usage

This could significantly contribute to improving the current state of public financial management.

India is already in the lead on digital payments through UPI. CBDC complements this system by offering:

A digital form of cash

Instant Offline Transaction in remote areas

Low-cost or zero-cost transactions

More secure, RBI-backed transfers

In all, increased merchant use would make the retail payment landscape much richer and more competitive.

Benefits for small and medium businesses include:

Lower payment fees

Faster settlement

Direct access to digital currency, no intermediaries.

Easier reconciliation and accounting

CBDC may also permit programmable business payments, such as automatic invoicing or real-time credit scoring.

Crypto is already influencing India's investment and tech landscape.

Web3, blockchain, and crypto startups have blown up globally. India is becoming a leading talent hub for:

Blockchain developers

NFT designers

Smart contracts engineers

Analysts of DeFi

Crypto marketers

It is an industry that provides them with global lucrative career opportunities.

Crypto provides for faster and cheaper cross-border transfers compared with SWIFT and all other traditional schemes.

This helps freelancers, exporters, and people who work remotely for clients based abroad.

Crypto enables new types of investments.

Tokenized assets

NFTs

DeFi yield products

Token-based startups

These innovations are creating entirely new digital markets.

Of course, both face their own difficulties.

Privacy: there might be lots of tracking concerns among people.

Threats to cybersecurity: Any national digital currency requires immense security.

Bank disintermediation-that people could shift money from banks into CBDC wallets.

Technical dependency: Any outage or bug might affect the processing of payments.

It needs to balance transparency against user privacy: providing anonymous low-value transactions and traceable high-value ones.

Extremes of volatility: Prices can crash within minutes.

The common frauds and scams involve tokens, rug pulls, and hacking.

Regulatory uncertainty: India's crypto regulations are in a state of flux.

Security risks: Users are responsible for the care of private keys; when they lose them, their assets are lost forever.

Environmental concerns: Some cryptocurrencies have energy-heavy mining models.

Education and proper regulation can make crypto safer for the public, despite the risks.

It is not alone in the explorations of digital money, since many countries experiment with the CBDC while regulating crypto.

CBDC Around the World

China: Digital yuan pilot launched.

Europe: Working on the digital euro.

USA: Research Stage for Digital Dollar

Japan & Korea: Testing features of CBDCs.

Greater CBDC adoption indicates that more countries seek better control over digital payments and financial stability.

El Salvador has made Bitcoin legal tender. UAE, Singapore, and Switzerland support crypto-friendly legislations. Crypto exchanges and trading are regulated in the US and UK. MiCA regulations were introduced by the European Union. Cryptocurrency is not treated as a legally recognized currency but rather as a financial asset globally. Much in line with India's stance.

CBDC, Crypto, and Regulation India is developing a balanced approach to digital currency.

CBDC Expansion Plans More users across Indian cities Offline payment support Integration with major banks CBDCs for paying government-related services Cross-border CBDC tests with other countries

Crypto Regulation Outlook Although India has not banned crypto, proposed next steps might include the Licensing of exchanges Clear regulations concerning stablecoins

Crypto-ads - guidelines Stronger KYC and AML Standards Tax reforms for stimulating innovation A balanced regulatory framework can make India emerge as a global Web3 hub.

No, both are for different purposes. CBDC is used for digital payments. Cryptocurrency is used for investments, decentralized applications, and international financial tools. They shall live together but take different routes. Impact on India's Financial Future The country of India is moving toward a mixed digital economy. CBDC will strengthen the traditional financial system, while cryptocurrency will encourage innovation and new industries such as Web3, gaming, and DeFi. It is likely that India, bound by evolving regulations, will find a balance between financial security and technological innovation.

1. Is CBDC the same as cryptocurrency?

No, CBDC is issued by the RBI, whereas cryptocurrency is decentralized and private.

2. Is the Digital Rupee legal in India?

Yes, CBDC is absolutely legal tender.

3. Can I invest in CBDC?

No, the CBDC is not an investment; it is just digital cash.

4. Is cryptocurrency legal in India?

Crypto is permitted but not considered legal tender. It is taxed at 30%.

5. Which one is safer: CBDC or cryptocurrency?

CBDC is safer because it is backed by the RBI, while crypto can be quite dangerous on account of its volatility and cyber threats.

India is at a very strong juncture in financial history. The rise of CBDC, or Digital Rupee, and cryptocurrency proves how fast the concept of money is changing. While CBDC brings in much-needed trust, stability, and global-standard efficiency to the Indian financial system, cryptocurrency offers innovation, borderless transactions, and investment opportunities. Both of them will create a different future. A better understanding of the differences will surely empower Indians to make some valuable choices as India marches toward a totally digital economy.

                            Dogecoin ETF debuts flat, altcoin ETFs see record inflow. | Credit: Hameem Sarwar.                        


Key Takeaways

Dogecoin's long-awaited Wall Street debut arrived—and barely made a sound.

Grayscale's GDOG, the first U.S. spot Dogecoin (DOGE) exchange-traded fund (ETF), opened trading on Nov. 24 on NYSE Arca to what can only be described as a subdued reception.

The new fund posted zero net inflows on launch day  and generated just $1.41 million in trading volume—far short of early expectations that hovered near $12 million.

The flat debut stood in sharp contrast to the rest of the altcoin ETF sector, which is showing real signs of life again just as the market attempts a recovery.

With Bitcoin (BTC) still struggling under the pressure of weeks of ETF outflows, investors appear increasingly willing to rotate into “second-tier” majors.

And on Monday, that shift became impossible to ignore.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs  continued to bleed, logging $151 million in net outflows Monday, erasing Friday's brief $203 million rebound.

BlackRock's dominant IBIT fund took the hardest hit with $149 million in outflows.

Bitwise and Ark Invest also saw red. The only bright spot was Fidelity's FBTC, which managed $15.49 million in inflows.

This came even as Bitcoin climbed off yearly lows of $80,000, closing near $88,800 at Monday's U.S. market close.

But institutional sentiment remains mixed, and ETF investors are still withdrawing capital after nearly $3 billion in combined BTC ETF outflows since early November.

While the broader crypto market grappled with outflows, altcoin-focused spot ETFs bucked the trend on Nov. 24, registering fresh inflows across Ethereum, Solana, and XRP products. 

If there was a single standout Monday, it was XRP.

Spot XRP ETFs pulled in $164 million—their largest daily inflow to date and the seventh straight day of gains.

All four issuers (Bitwise, Canary, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton) saw net-positive activity , with Grayscale's GXRP and Franklin's XRPZ leading at over $60 million each.

XRP closed the day around $2.10 after bouncing off $1.96 support.

Ethereum , which had endured eight straight days of outflows, finally turned green again.

Monday saw $96.67 million in ETH ETF inflows, led by BlackRock's ETHA with $92.6 million. ETH closed the day near $2,830 as the market stabilized.

Although ETH is still far below the highs of earlier this year, two consecutive inflow days suggest institutions are cautiously stepping back in.

Solana's ETF  momentum continues to defy the broader market.

Spot SOL ETFs attracted $57.79 million on Monday, marking 20 consecutive inflow days—a record streak for any altcoin ETF to date.

Bitwise's BSOL led with $39.7 million, while Fidelity's FSOL added $9.7 million.

SOL closed just above $137 after recovering from weekend lows under $130.

Despite strong ETF flows, SOL remains down roughly 20% this month.

Even with its day-one hype, the Dogecoin ETF posted no flows whatsoever, and neither did the spot Litecoin ETF.

It's possible GDOG will follow a similar trajectory to early Solana ETF activity, which started quietly before surging. But for now, appetite appears limited.

Dogecoin's underlying asset closed Monday near $0.146, little changed from pre-launch levels.

Zug, Switzerland, November 25th, 2025, Chainwire

TrustLinq enables cryptocurrency spending for individuals and businesses by facilitating direct crypto-to-fiat payments without a bank account.

TrustLinq, a Swiss-regulated crypto-to-fiat payment intermediary, announced the launch of its pioneering crypto-to-fiat payment platform that enables cryptocurrency holders to send fiat payments directly from crypto holdings to anyone, anywhere in the world in over 70 local currencies. The platform, underpinned by Swiss oversight, bank-level compliance and secure automation enables direct crypto-to-fiat seamlessly and executes payments via local payment rails — or through TrustLinq debit cards (debit cards Q1 2026). 

The platform addresses a critical market inefficiency: while over 580 million cryptocurrency users exist globally, less than 0.005% of businesses accept digital assets directly. This creates friction for crypto holders seeking to deploy digital assets for real-world expenses such as rent, payroll, supplier payments, and operational costs. TrustLinq eliminates this friction by enabling direct crypto-to-fiat payments without requiring recipients to accept crypto, open a wallet, or change their banking setup. 

TrustLinq is an early-mover in the emerging niche of crypto-to-fiat payment facilitation, with no direct competitors offering comparable functionality. Unlike existing cryptocurrency payment processors that require merchants to accept digital currencies directly, TrustLinq empowers crypto holders to leverage their digital assets for fiat payments to any third party globally importantly, TrustLinq clients do not need a bank account to use the platform, while recipients utilize their existing banking infrastructure to receive fiat, as opposed to the traditional method of converting crypto to fiat before it is deposited into their bank accounts.
		



The platform serves two primary market segments with tailored solutions. For individuals, TrustLinq enables cryptocurrency holders to pay personal expenses such as rent, tuition, leisure and international transfers directly from crypto holdings. For businesses, the platform enables crypto-to-fiat payouts for vendor payments, international payroll, and operational expenses. The solution particularly resonates with trading firms, affiliate networks, SaaS companies, and e-commerce businesses that receive cryptocurrency as operational revenue.

Sharon Gal Franko, Chief Executive Officer of TrustLinq, commented: "The future of payments requires bridging crypto and fiat seamlessly. With 580m+ crypto users globally holding substantial digital assets, the demand for practical, compliant fiat utility is immense. TrustLinq transforms how individuals and businesses deploy cryptocurrency in the real world, not through speculation, but through practical financial operations."

Looking ahead, TrustLinq plans to launch debit card capabilities in Q1 2026 to expand payment options and enable direct cryptocurrency-funded purchases at traditional merchants worldwide. The roadmap underscores the company's commitment to transitioning cryptocurrency from a speculative asset class into a practical financial instrument for daily operations and personal expenses.

About TrustLinq

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is struggling to gain momentum as it heads toward its worst month since June 2022.

As prices hover above $88,000 per token, or roughly 30% off their October all-time highs of more than $126,000, the cryptocurrency's problems don't appear to be easing.

And three key challenges for bitcoin have emerged as investors and strategists dig through the rubble of this month's decline.

First, outflows of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for November have reached $3.5 billion, their largest since February. "That indicates that institutional investors have stopped allocating into bitcoin," 10X Research founder and CEO Markus Thielen said. "These ETFs have turned into sellers, and as long as they keep selling, I think the markets will struggle to stay up, or rebound," he said.

Another issue: Thielen pointed to a slowdown in stablecoin minting activity, a warning that could suggest less capital is entering the crypto ecosystem. According to the firm's data, roughly $800 million flowed out of crypto and back into fiat currencies last week. While not a massive figure, it reinforces the trend that money is not staying within the market.

A stablecoin is a crypto asset that, unlike bitcoin, isn't supposed to fluctuate. Instead, its price is pegged to other assets, most commonly the US dollar. Because they provide a haven during volatile crypto market swings, their market capitalizations can often increase during periods of market volatility. That happened in the days after crypto's historic wipeout last month.

However, the trend has reversed: Through Nov. 1, the total market capitalization for stablecoins has dropped by $4.6 billion, according to DeFiLlama data.

"Money is not just failing to come in, it's actually leaving the crypto market," Thielen said. "That's why bitcoin dominance is failing to pick up."

Recent dovish comments hinting at a Federal Reserve rate cut in December helped lift bitcoin and other assets on Monday. But 10X's Thielen expects the bounce to fade in the coming days or into the FOMC meeting on Dec. 9.

Even if the Fed cuts in December, it is likely to be a hawkish cut, meaning this rally should be viewed as a short-term, oversold reaction amid extreme fear rather than the start of a sustainable V-shaped recovery. Bitcoin has struggled to recover since the leveraged liquidation event on Oct. 10 wiped out $19 billion in a single day.

The third challenge facing bitcoin: Long-term holders had already been selling into the downturn, possibly in anticipation of the token's historical four-year cycle. Bitcoin's past performance from peak to trough has largely followed an every-four-year supply cut known as "the halving." Many investors now deny that the same trajectory will repeat.

"There has been OG people selling every single cycle," said Nicolai Søndergaard, a research analyst for blockchain analytics firm Nansen. "I think they just reach that point where they decide, okay, maybe I've gotten old enough, and I want to use this money now for something else."

The sell-off has rippled across nearly every corner of the digital asset space, with total crypto market capitalization falling more than 30%, from $4.28 trillion on Oct. 6 to $2.99 trillion as of Monday.

Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also tumbled 38% since early October, while Solana (SOL-USD) dropped more than 40% during the same period.

Along with the odds that the Federal Reserve lowers its policy rate next month, the best chance for a reversal in the crypto markets, according to Søndergaard, will come from ETFs or more companies buying in.

Strategy (MSTR) and the wave of public companies that have imitated its playbook of adding bitcoin and other digital assets to their corporate balance sheets has significantly cooled. Notably, the company did not make any announcement of weekly token purchases on Monday, following six consecutive weeks of buys.

While Strategy is still in the green, many of these other so-called digital asset treasuries (DATs) are now underwater on their crypto positions.

Meanwhile, bitcoin miners like IREN (IREN), Riot (RIOT), and Mara Holdings (MARA) have retraced more than 30% to the downside, despite their pivots toward servicing the AI sector.

A sentencing decision in the Provincial Court of British Columbia this month revealed the graphic details of a 2024 attack in which the victims were bound, waterboarded, and sexually assaulted—all in an effort to steal the family's Bitcoin holdings.

The “wrench attack,” or physical attack in which an assailant attempts to gain access to a victim's cryptocurrency, took place on April 27-28, 2024. 

During the home invasion, four men unlawfully entered the victims' home, first gaining access when two of the men dressed as Canadian Post workers sought a signature for a fake package.

After entering the home, the men then closed the door behind them, and were later joined by two others. Once inside, the victims—a husband, wife, and daughter—were restrained with zip ties. 

They were then threatened and beaten as the assailants sought to gain access to the father's cryptocurrency. As they attempted to access his funds, they forced the daughter to remove her clothes, exposing her genitalia as they recorded multiple videos. She was instructed to say explicit phrases, and was physically assaulted by one of the crew. 

The men also waterboarded the husband and wife, and threatened to cut off the husband's genitals if he did not provide them with the access to his funds.

The man had reportedly boasted about his success with crypto investments within the Chinese community of British Columbia leading the crew to initially seek 200 Bitcoin—currently valued at around $17.8 million—during their attack. Later, they lowered their demand to 100 BTC, but ultimately made away with much less, nearly draining the crypto accounts of the victims and making off with around $1.6 million in total.

After being tied up and wrapped in a blanket, eventually the daughter heard a door close and partially freed herself before fleeing the residence and calling 911. 

In May of this year, one of the four crew members, Tsz Wing Boaz Chan, pleaded guilty to breaking and entering, unlawfully confining the victims, and sexual assault. This month, Chan was sentenced to seven years in jail for his role in the crime.

Wrench attacks are on the rise this year, nearly doubling last year's mark according to a recorded count by Jameson Lopp, the co-founder and chief security officer at self-custody crypto wallet platform, Casa. 

Lopp's database, which extends back to 2014, now counts 60 documented incidents in 2025 alone. 

This weekend, a man posing as a delivery driver robbed a San Francisco home owner of $11 million worth of crypto. And on Sunday, a Chinese victim had $10,000 stolen after an alleged kidnapping and robbery in Thailand.

Earlier this year, the high-profile kidnapping and wrench attack of Ledger co-founder David Balland and his wife left the crypto entrepreneur with a severed finger.

COP30 left many countries disappointed because no new road maps were created to help nations transition away from fossil fuels.Credit: Wagner Meier/Getty

Ten years after the Paris agreement was adopted, world leaders left the United Nations COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, with an outcome that kept the process alive but does little to stave off the perils of global warming. Many scientists walked away dismayed and disappointed.

Despite years of commitments and research that have laid the groundwork for action, the climate summit of achieved “essentially nothing”, says Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.

But, there were some signs of hope that multilateralism can tackle climate change. Over the course of two weeks, representatives from nearly 200 governments worked through hot days, long nights, a fire in the venue and numerous protests — including by Indigenous groups and others fighting for the protection of the Amazon and other tropical forests.

In the end, governments agreed to a package of measures that pushes forward discussions on financial aid and a new ‘just transition' mechanism designed to ensure a fair and equitable shift from fossil fuels to clean energy. A glaring omission was language calling for the creation of road maps to phase out fossil fuels and halt deforestation, but Brazil has announced it will push those ideas forward independently of the COP process.

Here, Nature takes a look at the results from COP30 and what comes next.

The summit failed to deliver major new pledges to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. Out of the 194 entities and countries that sent representatives to COP30, roughly 80 didn't submit new commitments for 2035, as required under the accord, and the rest submitted weak pledges that are unlikely to alter global trajectory. As a result, scientists with the Climate Action Tracker consortium still project that the world is on track for upwards of 2.6 ° C of warming by 2100.

“The new commitments don't even move the needle,” says Niklas Höhne, a climate-policy researcher at the NewClimate Institute, an environmental think tank based in Berlin. “It's really a sign that countries have limited appetite to support something more ambitious on climate.”

Fossil fuels took centre stage briefly. More than 80 countries joined Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the call for the creation of a road map to phase out fossil fuels, but the proposal ultimately foundered after reported opposition from oil-producing nations including Saudi Arabia and others.

But the idea isn't dead yet. Brazil promised to push forwards with it independently of the COP process, while the governments of Colombia and the Netherlands announced that they would host the first global conference on the just transition away from fossil fuels in April next year.

One of the largest disputes at the summit was who should pay for climate action and help developing nations to prepare for and adapt to the unavoidable impacts of global warming. Progress was made: wealthier nations committed to tripling the amount of money they provide to help low-income countries tackle global warming — to US$300 billion annually by 2035. The agreement also carries forward a broader goal of boosting the total to $1.3 trillion annually from all sources, including private investments.

But questions remain about how this will be financed. Previous deals on climate action have been plagued by delays in achieving financial goals as well as by disagreements about how much money should come from publicly funded grants, as opposed to loans and private investments.

The final deal at COP30 lays out a process to clarify these issues over the next two years. It's a step towards ensuring that wealthy countries meet their responsibilities to provide climate finance to those in need, says Jodi-Ann Wang, who researches equity and climate finance at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

Eric Boyd and his research team investigated how a burst of small earthquakes in 2021 affected the communities of microbes living deep beneath the Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field. These microbes inhabit rock and water systems far below the surface, where sunlight never reaches. Instead of relying on photosynthesis, they depend on chemical reactions that occur when water moves through fractured rock. This chemistry provides the energy that supports many forms of underground life.

Earthquakes have the potential to reshape this environment in several ways. Shaking can break open new rock surfaces, force out fluids that were previously sealed away, and redirect the flow of water through the subsurface. Each of these effects can create fresh chemical reactions, which in turn alter the types of energy available to microbial communities. The authors refer to this shift in available resources as a change in the chemical "menu" that microbes can draw from.

Sampling Yellowstone's Deep Fluids After the Quake Swarm

To understand how seismic activity influenced this hidden ecosystem, the researchers collected water samples from a nearly 100-meter deep borehole located along the western edge of Yellowstone Lake. They sampled the site five times throughout 2021, giving them a rare look at how conditions changed both immediately and over the following months.

Analyses of these samples showed notable increases in hydrogen, sulfide, and dissolved organic carbon after the earthquakes. These compounds serve as important energy sources for many subsurface organisms. As the chemistry of the water shifted, the team also detected a rise in planktonic cells, suggesting that more microbes were present in the water column than before. This combination of chemical and biological changes indicates that the quake swarm temporarily boosted the resources available to deep microbial life.

Microbial Communities in Motion

Beyond detecting an increase in cell numbers, Boyd and colleagues observed that the types of microbes present changed over time. This result stands out because subsurface microbial communities in continental bedrock aquifers are often considered relatively stable. In contrast, the Yellowstone system appeared to respond quickly and noticeably to the pulse of seismic energy.

According to the authors, the kinetic energy associated with earthquakes can influence both the chemistry and the biological makeup of aquifer fluids. Their findings imply that even small seismic events can drive meaningful ecological shifts underground.

Implications for Other Worlds With Rock and Water

The processes observed in the Yellowstone borehole may not be unique. Many regions around the world experience regular seismic activity that could similarly reshape subsurface energy supplies. If this mechanism is widespread, it could help explain how microbial life persists in deep and isolated environments.

The team also notes that the same basic dynamics might occur on other rocky planets that contain water. If earthquakes or similar geological motions can refresh chemical resources below the surface, this could expand the possible habitats for microbes on worlds such as Mars.

The Newberry Volcano south of Bend, Oregon, is the source of superhot rocks capable of producing electricity.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The planet is a roiling ball of geothermal energy, but so far, the U.S. hasn't been great at tapping into this near limitless energy source. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the country has geothermal plants located in only seven states—all out west—producing roughly 0.4 percent (17 billion kilowatt-hours) of utility-scale electricity generation as of 2023. However, it doesn't take much imagination to see the untapped potential of geothermal energy. Iceland, for example, generates more than one-fourth of its electricity needs from geothermal energy directly. 

In an effort to tap into that potential, a start-up called Mazama Energy, is focusing its sights on Newberry Volcano, a large, active, shield volcano located roughly 20 miles south of Bend, Oregon. While not as well known as other Cascade volcanoes, such a Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier, or even Mount Hood, Newberry is the largest volcano in the Cascade Volcanic Range, and the United States Geological Survey considers it a “very high threat” volcano, similar to Mauna Loa and Kīlauea in Hawaii. However, mixed within that danger is also an unprecedented geothermal opportunity. 

The reason why so many geothermal projects lie out west is because these super-heated resources lie much closer to the surface than in the eastern U.S. For the past 50 years, the area around Newberry Volcano has been explored for geothermal opportunities, but the startup Mazama Energy is using a technique known as “superhot rock.” Typical geothermal sites represent a perfect alignment of hot rock and water, which can produce steam that powers turbines. With superhot rock, on the other hand, energy companies inject water into areas with dry superheated rock at tempratures that are preferably over the threshold of 705 degrees Fahrenheit. 

At this temperature, and also under a lot of pressure, water becomes supercritical and begins acting like a mix of a liquid and gas. According to The Washington Post, this supercritical water can hold more heat like a liquid but flow like a gas, providing five to ten times more energy than typical geothermal operations.

“The [liquid] water is Clark Kent when it goes down,” Sriram Vasantharajan, Mazama's CEO, told The Washington Post. “Then it gets heated, and when it comes up, it's Superman.”

Similar to Mazama Energy's plans in Oregon, a 2024 report from the Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG) at the University of Texas at Austin similarly found that injecting water into superhot rock near the town of Presidio in southwestern Texas could provide a significant amount of electricity. In fact, according to a model produced by the Clean Air Task Force, 20 percent of the U.S.'s landmass, or around 750 thousand square miles, has superhot rock energy potential. 

But this energy doesn't come without risks, the biggest of which being man-made earthquakes. Fracking for natural gas is known to cause tremors by changing pressure conditions along faults, and in 2018, South Korea experienced its second most-powerful earthquake in modern history due to a geothermal plant. These risks can be managed with robust monitoring and engineering, and additionally, pollution isn't an issue since water recirculates in sealed wells and at distances below most groundwater reservoirs. 

Mazama Energy still needs to face the daunting task of keeping drilling and energy-producing infrastructure running under such punishing conditions, but the company tells The Washington Post they hope to produce 15 megawatts of electricity on Newberry Volcano's western flank by next year, and eventually pump out as much as 200 megawatts, roughly the energy budget of a small city. However, those numbers are small in comparison to the site's theoretical potential, which could be as high as five gigawatts, according to Vasantharajan—roughly two-thirds of Oregon's average energy output. 

Those geothermal aspirations, however, currently remain out of reach, but the U.S. hopes for geothermal to provide 16 percent of the country's energy mix by 2050. If it has any hope of achieving that dream, superhot rocks could be the key reason why.

Which Pie Gives You the Biggest Sugar Rush: Pecan, Apple or Pumpkin?

Scientific American asked experts which type of Thanksgiving pie spikes blood sugar the most—and how to eat healthier while still enjoying the holidays

By Tanya Lewis edited by Jeanna Bryner

I love a good pie. Every year for Thanksgiving I make a bourbon chocolate pecan pie, which is every bit as decadent—and delicious—as it sounds. But it contains an ungodly amount of corn syrup and sugar, so it got me thinking: Which type of pie spikes your blood sugar the fastest? And is there a “healthier” pie?

Pie varieties abound, so I focused on some of the classics: pecan, pumpkin and apple. Regardless of filling, when you take a bite of pie, the carbohydrates get delivered to your bloodstream as glucose that ultimately gets absorbed by cells. The faster those sugars get into your bloodstream, the quicker you experience a sugar rush. Any guesses on which pie would shuttle the most sugars the quickest?

To get to the bottom of this gooey puzzle, I talked to Sarah Berry, a professor of nutritional sciences at Kings College London, and Sandra Arévalo, director of community health and wellness at Montefiore Nyack Hospital.

Here's how the different pies really stack up, according to the experts:

Not all pies are created equally: you have more control over the ingredients in homemade pies, so they tend to be healthier than store-bought ones. In general, though, many pecan pies are on the sweeter side.

“If we think of the average apple, pecan or pumpkin pie, on average, the pecan tends to be higher in sugar, followed by the pumpkin, followed by the apple pie,” Berry says. “But what we also know is the pecan tends to be higher in protein as well and tends to be a little bit higher in fiber.”

So even though pecan pie is high in sugar, the protein and fiber slow down stomach emptying and, in turn, the release of glucose into the bloodstream. Protein also stimulates the release of the hormone insulin, which moves sugar into your cells and out of your bloodstream, Berry says. (Score one point for pecan pie!)

But because pecans aren't that sweet, people often add a lot of sugar, Arévalo says. If you're making the pie at home, you can add less sugar or corn syrup. Pecan pie recipes often have corn syrup in them not only for the sweetness but for the texture, she says. So you could reduce the amount of corn syrup and replace it with chia seeds, for example.

Another option for slowing the sugar rush in pecan pie is to serve it with a scoop of plain yogurt or some unsweetened cream, Berry and Arévalo suggest.

Pumpkin pie generally contains less sugar and more dietary fiber than pecan.

“Pumpkin is pretty sweet already,” Arévalo says, “so you might not need to add as much sugar. It has a little fiber, but it has zero protein.”

Here again, you could serve the pie with some plain yogurt or even some nuts on top for a little extra protein. Nuts also give the pie some crunch, she says.

Of the three pies mentioned, apple pie generally contains the least sugar and most fiber.

“The more fruit it has, the better. The less sugar it has, the better. The more protein and fiber, the better,” Arévalo says.

Still, “there's huge variability from one shop-bought apple pie to another shop-bought apple pie to a homemade apple pie,” Berry notes. If you're making the pie at home, you can use less sugar, and you can also make a whole-grain crust for the fiber, she says. For the filling, Arévalo recommends using apples with their fiber-rich peels on.

Overall there's not a huge difference in the fiber or protein content of all three pies, Berry says. “So if I was going to have to opt for the lowest sugar—the pie that's going to increase my sugar the least—I'd probably say apple pie,” she says.

Arévalo agrees: “Apple pie, I will say, looking at the glycemic load of all of these.” Glycemic load is a measure of how a given food affects blood sugar.

As mentioned already, pecan pies tend to pack the most powerful punch, sugar-wise, and pumpkin pie isn't necessarily any better.

But apple pie isn't always the healthier option here. “If the pecan pie doesn't have a lot of sugar, then I will put pecan pie first. It really depends on how sweet it is,” Arévalo says.

You can make any homemade pie healthier by adjusting the amount of sugar, protein and fiber. And there are other ways to offset the effects of your pie consumption by taking a brisk walk after dessert. Eating breakfast and snacking on protein and fiber throughout the day can help prepare your body for the big meal and prevent a gigantic sugar spike.

Ultimately, you should just enjoy your Thanksgiving feast. “At the end of the day, Thanksgiving is there for joy, for family, for connection, and the food that you eat should bring you joy,” Berry says. “If you enjoyed the pecan and the pumpkin and the apple, and you want lots of sugar in it, I wouldn't worry about it, personally.”

This Fossil Is Rewriting the Story of How Plants Spread across the Planet

An enigmatic group of fossil organisms has finally been identified—and is changing the story of how plants took root on land

By Taylor Mitchell Brown edited by Andrea Thompson

J. Lacerda/From "The rise of lichens during the colonization of terrestrial environments" by Bruno Becker-Kerber, et al., in Science Advances, Vol. 11, No. 44; October 29, 2025

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

Around 410 million years ago, terrestrial life was relatively simple. There were no forests or prairies—land was largely dominated by slimy microbial mats. The types of plants that would eventually give rise to trees and flowers had only just evolved and would take another several million years to fully flourish and diversify.

A new discovery is rewriting the story of how these vascular plants, as they are called, spread onto land. Researchers may have finally resolved a debate about an enigmatic but widespread fossil called Spongiophyton: it seems to have been a strange life-form called a lichen that may have helped pave the way for plants to thrive on land.

From "The rise of lichens during the colonization of terrestrial environments" by Bruno Becker-Kerber, et al., in Science Advances, Vol. 11, No. 44; October 29, 2025

The discovery, published recently in Science Advances, “settles a question that had been open for over a century,” says paleontologist Geovane Gaia, of the Institute of Geosciences at the State University of Campinas in Brazil, who was not involved with the research. “Until now, most people thought lichens appeared only after vascular plants, but this study shows they were already there at the beginning, literally helping prepare the ground for plant life.”

Lichens are the symbiotic result of fungi and photosynthetic algae or cyanobacteria working together. Today that amalgam helps churn lifeless rocks and sediments into nutrient-rich soil everywhere from polar deserts to tropical forests, says study lead author Bruno Becker-Kerber, a paleontologist at Harvard University. Vascular plants have tissues that funnel those soil nutrients from the ground to their stems and leaves.

Because lichens' soft body tissues are rarely preserved in the fossil record, their origins have remained mysterious. A 2019 genetic analysis suggested they evolved well after the emergence of vascular plants, indicating they likely played little to no role in early land colonization.

Scientists have long debated whether Spongiophyton, which flourished around 410 million years ago, was lichen or algae. To determine the fossils' identity, Becker-Kerber and his colleagues analyzed the underlying chemical properties of lingering organic material within the fossils.

Unlike algae, which are lined with cell walls, lichen contain fungi lined with chitin, the same material that makes up the exoskeletons of insects. Chitin is loaded with nitrogen, and the team's results turned up an unmistakable nitrogen signal. “The more we tested it, the more consistent the signal became,” Becker-Kerber says. “It was genuinely exciting.”

There were other fungal traits present, too, such as a distinct branching pattern exhibited by growing fungal cells called hyphae. The results suggest lichen evolved around 410 million years ago, shortly after the initial spread of vascular plants 420 million years ago and just before the earliest known forests around 390 million years ago.

“It's a major shift in how we view the complexity of life's first steps onto land,” Becker-Kerber says. Spongiophyton “likely weathered rocks, stabilized sediments, cycled nutrients and contributed to the formation of protosoils just before forests developed.”

“If Spongiophyton was a lichen, it may have enabled the expansion of land plants into areas previously uncolonized,” says Matthew Nelsen, an evolutionary biologist at the Field Museum of Natural History, who was not involved with the research.

The new picture suggests lichen emerged near the beginning of terrestrial plant history and the unique fungi-algae relationship may have been essential to the spread of plants. “People often tell the story of life's move onto land as a ‘plant story,'” Becker-Kerber says. “What our study shows is that fungi and lichens were also part of it.”

Directed hydrogen isotope exchange strategies have become an essential tool for accessing isotopically labelled organic scaffolds and interrogating the mechanisms of transition metal-catalysed C–H activation. However, the rationale behind deuterium source selection remains largely absent from the literature; an oversight that directly affects mechanistic interrogation strategies and hinders the development of new deuteration methodologies. Here we explore the influence of the deuterium source in base-assisted site-selective C–H deuteration reactions across a broad range of substrates using cobalt catalysis. We employ a synergistic combination of experimental studies and multivariable linear regression models based on proposed catalytic intermediates. Our findings demonstrate that the deuterium source can directly alter the operative mechanism, leading to distinct reaction pathways under different conditions. These results highlight previously overlooked complexity in hydrogen isotope exchange reactions and provide an example of how data-driven mechanistic analysis can expose subtle, reagent-dependent mechanistic shifts in catalytic behaviour.

Transition metal-catalysed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) bridges fundamental research and practical synthetic utility1,2,3,4,5. These reactions serve both as a mechanistic probe for studying the reversibility of C–H activation, and as an effective methodology for introducing isotopic labels into molecules relevant to medicinal chemistry6,7,8. Nevertheless, an elusive aspect of HIE is the suitability of a given deuterium source for a specific transformation. Even a close examination of the literature within the vibrant field of directed, base-assisted C–H activation, reveals an assortment of isotope sources across transition metal catalysis (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). This ambiguity led us to question whether hidden behind this deceptively simple transformation was a common yet overlooked pitfall—different combinations of conditions and substrates can trigger distinct mechanistic pathways.

a, Challenges and opportunities. The literature search for papers involving directed HIE was performed using SciFinder in March 2025 (Supplementary Table 1). b, Synergistic combination of experimental studies and MLR models based on proposed catalytic intermediates to uncover the influence of deuterium sources in HIE (this work). DG, directing group.

Most experimental or computational mechanistic approaches are predominantly geared to explore the mechanism of a reaction using a model substrate9,10,11,12,13. However, we sought to develop an approach that could shed light on complex mechanistic landscapes forged by changes to substrates and reaction conditions. To this end, we turned our attention to linear free energy relationship (LFER) studies, which follow the influence of substituent effects on a reaction outcome14. The underlying assumption behind LFER is that as long as substrates follow a similar mechanistic route, a linear correlation can be identified between a molecular descriptor (for example, Hammett electronic values or Tolman cone angles) and the reaction outcome (for example, the yield or selectivity)15,16. In recent years, this idea has been extended to multivariable linear regression (MLR), wherein several molecular descriptors are required to describe the factors that influence a reaction outcome17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24. Whereas descriptors are most often drawn from the structural properties of starting materials, in some cases meaningful correlations only emerge when features of key reaction intermediates are included25,26,27,28,29,30,31. Motivated by the idea that molecular descriptors from different reaction intermediates can more faithfully capture substrate behaviour in distinct reaction manifolds, we envisioned a strategy to explicitly evaluate divergent mechanistic pathways.

On the basis of this premise, in this work, we uncover mechanistically relevant pathways by analysing correlations between descriptors from different plausible intermediates and the reaction outcome (Fig. 1b). Namely, we seek to ask whether multiple mechanisms could be operative in HIE using the most common inexpensive and convenient deuterium sources, such as D2O, CD3OD or AcOD-d4. Our approach, rooted in the comparison of reaction intermediates, reveals a complex yet strong relationship between the substrate structure and the required deuterium source, revealing patterns inaccessible by intuition alone. These findings suggest that the isotope source can act as a mechanistic trigger, eliciting distinct pathways depending on the substrate structure.

We initiated our investigation by establishing a catalytic platform tailored to uncover the factors that govern hydrogen isotope exchange. Cp*CoIII complexes were chosen as an ideal model because they operate through a reversible C–H activation step32,33,34, enabling efficient H/D exchange across a wide array of directing groups and multiple deuterium sources35,36,37,38,39. We then evaluated its suitability for isotopic labelling using different deuterium sources on diverse scaffolds (Fig. 2). To this end, we targeted the following widely used directed C–H functionalization substrates, 2-phenylpyridine (I), benzaldehyde (II) and acetanilide (III), and identified three optimized reaction conditions (Supplementary Tables 2–4). Both 2-phenylpyridine (I) and benzaldehyde (II) underwent efficient H/D exchange using D2O as the deuterium source (Conditions A and B, respectively). By contrast, CD3OD provided the highest levels of deuterium incorporation for acetanilide (III, Condition C).

Deuterium incorporations were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. aFor substrate II, we added aniline (20 mol%).

To construct a diverse dataset for statistical analysis, we selected substrates that would have practical relevance but would also provide a broad distribution of structural diversity and deuteration levels (Fig. 3). Under Condition A, we examined a series of 2-phenylpyridine derivatives, observing a broad functional group tolerance for both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents at the phenyl para position (2–4). Compounds 5 and 6, which contain additional coordinating functionalities, are deuterated only at the position ortho to the pyridine-directing group, which is consistent with the strong coordinating effect of N-containing heterocycles. Steric hindrance at the ortho position (7) did not strongly affect the outcome, and modifications to the pyridine ring itself (8–10) preserved reactivity. We also evaluated the late-stage deuteration of biologically relevant molecules. The pyridine-containing antiretroviral drug atazanavir (11) afforded high deuterium incorporation in excellent yield.

Condition A: substrate (0.25 mmol), Cp*Co(CO)I2 (10 mol%), KOAc (20 mol%), AgSbF6 (20 mol%), D2O (25 equiv.), DCE (0.5 ml), 50 °C, 2 h. Condition B: substrate (0.25 mmol), Cp*Co(CO)I2 (10 mol%), Cu(OAc)2 (10 mol%), AgSbF6 (20 mol%), D2O (10 equiv.), DCE (2.5 ml), 100 °C, 2 h. Condition C: substrate (0.25 mmol), Cp*Co(CO)I2 (10 mol%), Cu(OAc)2 (10 mol%), AgSbF6 (20 mol%), CD3OD (10 equiv.), DCE (5 ml), 100 °C, 2 h. aReaction carried out at 0.1 mmol scale. bAniline (20 mol%) was added. cYield determined by 1H NMR of the reaction crude with 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as internal standard.

For Condition B, we targeted aromatic aldehydes, using aniline as a transient directing group for in situ imine formation40,41. The transient role of aniline was confirmed by submitting the preformed imine of benzaldehyde (13), N-benzylideneaniline (12), to Condition B in the absence of aniline, which afforded the same deuterium incorporation as benzaldehyde. A diverse range of aromatic aldehydes were efficiently deuterated (13–26) under these conditions. Compound 20, which contains an aldehyde and pyridine group, was deuterated across all ortho positions. The same reactant under Condition A was uniquely deuterated at the positions ortho to pyridine (see compound 5). We note that the acetamido group of compound 19 did not facilitate isotope labelling and only the positions ortho to the aldehyde were deuterated. When 5-phenylthiophene-2-carbaldehyde (26) was subjected to Condition B, we only observed H/D exchange at the ortho positions of the carbonyl group, indicating that thiophene is not a suitable directing group under these conditions. Interestingly, in the absence of aniline, Condition B remained highly efficient for arenes containing strong N-based directing groups (substrates 27–46), which had shown limited reactivity under Condition A. These results include several pharmaceutically relevant heterocycles, such as pyrazoles and oxazoles, and the late-stage functionalization of the anti-inflammatory drug etoricoxib (45), as well as the arthritis medication oxaprozin (46).

Finally, we examined the compatibility of Condition C with a variety of amide derivatives, which are prevalent in medicinal chemistry42. Acetanilides bearing electron-donating or electron-withdrawing moieties with different substitution patterns reached moderate to high degrees of deuterium incorporation (47–53). Sterically demanding groups connected to the carbonyl group proved to be beneficial for this transformation (54 and 55). A urea derivative (56) and monosubstituted amides (57 and 58) were compatible with our protocol. A clear decrease in deuterium incorporation was observed for disubstituted amides (59–62), but lactam 63, a cyclic disubstituted amide, afforded improved deuterium incorporation. Lastly, functional group compatibility was tested in selected biologically active molecules containing challenging moieties, such as hydroxy or carboxylic acid motifs (64 and 65).

In agreement with our results, the necessity of using different deuterium sources is also widespread in the HIE literature1,2,3,4,5. However, there are no studies focused on uncovering the mechanistic implications of the deuterium source on a given organic scaffold in base-assisted C–H deuteration. Thus, we sought to apply MLR models to correlate the structural features of scaffolds with their corresponding deuterium incorporation values43,44,45.

Initially, we attempted to produce models using molecular descriptors derived directly from substrate structures. However, these features led to poor correlations (Supplementary Fig. 3). As a result, we hypothesized that molecular descriptors produced from reaction intermediates could provide improved models and might better capture mechanistic distinctions between the tested condition sets (Fig. 4). The main setback towards extracting such molecular descriptors is the identification of catalytically relevant intermediates that could represent the mechanism of the studied reaction.

a, Illustration of the most predictive MLR models identified for each condition. The linear graphs represent the correlation between the predicted and measured deuterium levels taken as \(\triangle \triangle G=\,-{RT}\log \left(\frac{ \% {\text{H}}}{ \% {\text{D}}}\right)\) to reflect the energy difference for obtaining each product with a 90% prediction interval in grey. Below each plot are the linear equations and the features identified to provide the best fit with the experimental outcomes. Each data point was sampled from a crude reaction performed in duplicates at a scale of 0.1 mmol. Proposed intermediates (Int) that were tested by MLR. Below each of the intermediates is a bar graph showing the goodness-of-fit R2 values (blue) and the leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation Q2 values (orange) for all the intermediates (values given between 0.6 and 0.9, see Supplementary Figs. 31–33) in each one of the conditions. b, Comparison of the deuterium incorporation obtained with different deuterium sources for Conditions A, B and C.

We viewed this challenge as an opportunity to develop a workflow based on sifting through correlations of features extracted from different plausible intermediates. This approach was based on the assumption at the crux of LFER studies that the best correlation with experimental results can enclose information regarding the relevant mechanistic pathway. By extending this assumption to reaction intermediates, we aimed to address a gap in the application of computational chemistry to tease out experimental mechanistic information. Whereas density functional theory (DFT) studies play a crucial role in revealing complete reaction pathways for a single model substrate, our approach provides a view of the reaction mechanism landscape through the prism of a broad set of substrates. In this work, to probe the potential involvement of different D shuttles under our reaction conditions, we selected several plausible intermediates to test on the basis of previous mechanistic proposals for directed base-assisted C–H activation46,47,48.

Setting all the tested substrates in each of these intermediates, we performed ground-state DFT computations and extracted relevant molecular descriptors (Supplementary Figs. 4–30). A linear regression model search across the features of each of the seven proposed intermediates was conducted to identify the best-fitted correlation to the deuteration level in the three reaction condition sets (Fig. 4a). We note that for intermediates where ROD molecules participate, we computed both D2O and CD3OD options.

For Condition A, a predictive model was identified based on intermediate Int5water, where acetic acid is directly coordinated to the metal and the deuterium source (D2O) bridges the D transfer through hydrogen bonding. The model reveals a tight correlation between deuterium incorporation and three molecular features: the partial charge on an acetic acid oxygen atom connected to the metal centre (q1), the overall dipole of the intermediate (μtot) and the minimal width of the substrate (Sterimol B1). According to the normalized regression coefficients the most impactful features are the charge and the total dipole of the intermediate, indicating that electronic effects probably play an important role in determining deuterium incorporation. In addition, all the features are localized on either the acetate or substrates, with the purely steric feature, B1, reflecting that the planarity of the substrates contributes to increasing deuterium incorporation. This model suggests that both acetic acid and water may be involved in the deuteration event in a cooperative deuterium transfer mechanism. When comparing the two models stemming from Int5 for the results of Condition A, the structure containing water provided a more robust model compared to the one with methanol (Int5water: R2 = 0.88, Q2LOO = 0.81; Int5methanol: R2 = 0.81, Q2LOO = 0.64). These outcomes are consistent with the experimental observation that D2O is a more effective deuterium source under Condition A (Supplementary Table 2).

For Condition B, the model identified intermediate 3 (Int3water) as having the best fit with the experimental results. Similarly to the substrates under Condition A, we identified an improved fit for the intermediate containing water as a deuterium source, which, here too, agrees with the experimental results (Supplementary Table 3). The model reveals a correlation between deuterium incorporation and four molecular features: the partial charge on the hydrogen atom that bridges between water and acetate (q2), the difference in partial charge between the cobalt and the carbon undergoing deuteration (∆q3), the difference in partial charge between the water hydrogen atom and the oxygen of the acetate (∆q4) and the distance between the cobalt and directing group (d1). Here, similarly to Condition A, the features lean towards stronger electronic control of reactivity, with charge-related features being particularly dominant. The coefficients of the normalized model are all similar in magnitude and the features are localized to either the substrate or acetate, yet, unlike Condition A, here the substrate features seem to be more electronic in nature.

Lastly, for Condition C, the model with the best fit to the experimental results was Int2, in which acetic acid is directly coordinated to the metal with no additional deuterium source included in the intermediate. The molecular features in this model include the partial charge on one of the ring carbons (q5), the overall dipole of the intermediate (μtot), the component of the dipole moment perpendicular to the benzene ring (μz) and the maximal width of the directing group (Sterimol B5). The normalized equation shows that μtot and Sterimol B5 are the most significant features, which indicates that this model leans toward steric control of deuterium incorporation compared with other conditions. Furthermore, the features are localized only on the substrates and not the acetate, unlike in Conditions A and B. In this model, the substrate is influenced by both steric and electronics features, and deuterium incorporation is increased when the width of the substrates' directing group is minimized and the dipole moment and charge on the substrate increase.

In all three models, acetate or acetic acid is connected to the cobalt centre. However, for Conditions A and B, the best-fitting intermediates involve a well-orchestrated organization of the deuterium source, acetate/acetic acid and substrate around the metal centre. By contrast, the intermediate identified for Condition C, relies solely on acetic acid. Interestingly, Conditions A and B use water as their deuterium source, whereas Condition C requires methanol. Thus, the intermediates that correlate with the experimental results might imply that the primary role of water as a deuterium source is deuterium shuttling at the product-determining transition state, whereas methanol might have a distinct role.

The superior performance of the model stemming from Int2 under Condition C, which only contains acetic acid, led us to speculate that methanol does not participate in the deuterodemetallation step, but rather facilitates a prior deuterium exchange. This proposal was supported by the fact that methanol's increased miscibility in dichloroethane (DCE) compared to water could endow it with the propensity to more easily transfer deuterium to acetate49. Indeed, under Condition C D2O leads to poor deuterium incorporation.

To test the hypothesis that under Condition C acetic acid might be the effective deuterating agent, we conducted experiments using AcOD-d4 with model substrates under each of the reaction conditions (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Tables 7–9). Gratifyingly, for acetanilide under Condition C, AcOD-d4 led to the same deuterium incorporation as CD3OD, supporting our hypothesis that acetic acid is the effective deuterating agent. By contrast, for 2-phenylpyridine under Condition A, AcOD-d4 led to a significant decrease in deuterium incorporation compared to D2O. This result fits well with the suggested intermediate Int5water, which requires the presence of both acetic acid and water to react in concert. Further supporting this hypothesis is the decrease in deuterium incorporation levels when switching from D2O to AcOD-d4 for 1-phenyl pyrazole under Condition B, for which Int3water that contains both an acetate and water provided the best fit.

Interestingly, this decrease under Condition B is much less pronounced compared to the decrease under Condition A. We turned to the correlated models to seek an explanation for this difference in outcomes and specifically to the correlations under each of these conditions with Int2, which only contained acetic acid. For Condition B the second best-fitted model corresponded to Int2 (R2 = 0.75, Q2LOO = 0.63), whereas for Condition A this intermediate provided a poor fit (R2 = 0.68, Q2LOO = 0.56; Supplementary Fig. 8). This result might suggest the existence of two competing pathways, which under Condition B are closer in energy and, therefore, could more easily be triggered by the presence of a different deuterium source.

The work discussed here seeks to unlock the untapped potential of reaction intermediate descriptors to reveal hidden mechanistic structure–function relationships. This approach is complementary to insight garnered by DFT computations, which often provide a detailed account of the full reaction trajectory for a model substrate, but are seldom extended to multiple substrates and conditions. By integrating this approach with detailed experimental data from base-assisted directed HIE reactions, we demonstrate that beyond simple differences in deuterium incorporation levels, the choice of deuterium source might lead to a mechanistic shift, highlighting the need to treat deuterium sources with caution in mechanistic studies.

Our analysis suggests that under Conditions A and B the deuterium source (D2O) participates directly in the deuteration step, whereas under Condition C isotope exchange with the deuterium source (CD3OD) probably occurs off-cycle. These mechanistic hypotheses were supported experimentally and illustrate the value of statistical models based on proposed reactive intermediates for uncovering hidden mechanistic complexity in catalytic reactions. Our findings reveal that the deuterium source can actively influence the reaction pathway, a factor that is critical for mechanistic interpretations, and which impacts reaction efficiency. Our work argues against assuming a single mechanistic pathway across substrates or metals and underscores the importance of evaluating multiple deuterium sources for each directing group. Furthermore, when employed in their non-deuterated form, these sources may mediate C–H bond cleavage when acting as solvents or additives. Therefore, the implications of this work extend beyond the specific catalytic system studied or HIE literature, as it reveals overlooked mechanistic distinctions that might be prevalent in organometallic catalysis.

Deuterium incorporations were determined by 1H NMR using D1 = 1 s when taking aromatic signals as reference. For the two examples (59, 62) in which aliphatic signals need to be taken as reference, D1 = 50 s was used. Isolated yields were calculated taking into consideration the deuterium incorporation in the final product. Cross-validation of the deuterium incorporation with HRMS was performed in 13 selected examples across the three reaction conditions.

The crude was filtered through a celite and silica pad. Deuterium incorporations were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy of the crude.

All substrates were modelled in a conformation directing the hydrogen and directing group in the same orientation. Substrates were computed using the M06-2X functional with the def2-TZVP basis set. Reaction intermediates were computed using the M06-2X functional with the 6-31g(d) basis set. For each intermediate, a set of computations was created, each time with a different substrate according to the experimental scope. After geometry optimization, features were extracted for each intermediate–substrate pair under each condition, and the resulting dataset was used to generate linear regression models. Feature extraction and modelling were performed using the moleculaR50 package in R.

Centromeres are defined by a unique single chromatin domain featuring the histone H3 variant, centromere protein A (CENP-A), and ensure proper chromosome segregation. Centromeric chromatin typically occupies a small subregion of low DNA methylation within multimegabase arrays of hypermethylated alpha-satellite repeats and constitutive pericentric heterochromatin. Here, we define the molecular basis of how heterochromatin serves as a primary driver of centromere and neocentromere position, size and number. Using single-molecule epigenomics, we uncover roles for H3K9me3 methyltransferases SUV39H1/H2 and SETDB1, in addition to noncanonical roles for SUZ12, in maintaining H3K9me3 boundaries at centromeres. Loss of these heterochromatin boundaries leads to the progressive expansion and/or repositioning of the primary CENP-A domain, erosion of surrounding DNA methylation and nucleation of additional functional CENP-A domains across the same alpha-satellite sequences. Our study identifies the functional importance and specialization of different H3K9 methyltransferases across centromeric and pericentric domains, crucial for maintaining centromere domain size and suppressing ectopic centromere nucleation events.

Centromeres are the chromosomal loci that drive chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis1,2. Human centromeres are characterized by multimegabase arrays of A+T-rich alpha-satellite DNA3,4. Intriguingly, these sequences, while abundant, are not strictly required for centromere function. Instead, centromere position in humans is, to a large extent, defined epigenetically. The key centromere-defining element is the histone H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A), which is sufficient to induce de novo centromere formation and appears as a central node in a self-propagating feedback loop that maintains centromere position5,6,7.

The discovery of spontaneous neocentromeres in humans epitomizes the epigenetic nature of centromeres, nucleating at sites devoid of alphoid DNA8,9,10,11,12. Once formed, these neocentromeres are functional and propagated indefinitely in somatic cells and, in certain cases, are even transgenerationally inherited8,12,13. Moreover, by deleting the endogenous centromere locus in model systems, neocentromeres can be induced experimentally, which rescues chromosome stability14,15,16,17,18. In human cells, this approach allows us to explore the genetic and epigenetic contributions to centromere seeding and inheritance, as well as monitor the evolution of spontaneously formed centromeres.

Centromeres are propagated by the stable transmission of CENP-A chromatin that serves as a template for the self-directed assembly of new CENP-A nucleosomes each cell cycle19,20,21. This self-propagating cycle is predicted to generate variation in the precise positioning of the centromere because of the dynamic nature of histone recycling during DNA replication and transcription22. Indeed, centromere drift has been observed in evolutionary new centromeres of donkeys and chicken Z chromosomes23,24. However, despite this local drift, vertebrate centromeres remain restricted to their broader chromosomal locus even if CENP-A is temporarily removed25 and their size remains restricted to ~100–500 kb at both canonical and neocentromeres3,18,26,27. The tightly constrained CENP-A domain is somewhat surprising as such ‘islands' of CENP-A typically reside in megabase-sized domains of homogenous alphoid repeats, indicating the existence of non-sequence-defined centromere boundaries.

One potential boundary is 5mCG DNA methylation. Endogenous human centromeres occur within arrays of alpha-satellite higher-order repeat (HORs) that generally have hypermethylated DNA, except for a distinct site of hypomethylation coinciding with strong enrichment of CENP-A chromatin, termed centromere dip regions (CDRs)3,28. In addition, constitutive heterochromatin, marked by histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), spans human satellite (HSat) DNA families in flanking pericentromeric regions, such as the classical HSats 1–3 (refs. 29,30), and has been hypothesized to maintain centromere position31.

H3K9me3 has also been observed to at least partially overlap with centromeric repeats32,33,34,35,36 and was recently mapped within active alpha-satellite HOR arrays37, indicating that the chromatin environment at and around the CENP-A locus may be of functional importance. Whether heterochromatin forms a true functional boundary and how this is regulated remain open questions.

We previously isolated a de novo human neocentromere in cultured human RPE1 cells (Fig. 1a)18. This neocentromere, on the p arm of Chr4, Neo4p13, is 90 kb in size and formed in a gene-poor region, within high levels of H3K9me3 constitutive heterochromatin18, analogous to canonical centromeres. This system offers a unique time-stamped centromere to understand how centromere position and size are maintained, following its formation, independent of satellite sequences (Fig. 1b). We took an early Neo4p13 isolate and proliferated three independent populations for 100 days. We then randomly isolated three clonal subpopulations from each independently evolved pool and assessed centromere position using CENP-A CUT&RUN (Fig. 1c). In early-passage cells (red), CENP-A mapped to a 90-kb window from 42.86 Mb to 42.96 Mb (Fig. 1d, red track), positioned in the same location as the initial neocentromere isolate18. Upon prolonged cell culture (day 100, gray), we observed a gradual centromere drift over time (Fig. 1d–f), with shifts in either direction and an average shift of peak center of 8.74 kb (Fig. 1d, arrows). This gradual movement of the CENP-A domain is consistent with previous studies in evolutionary new centromeres23,24,38. Strikingly, however, the overall size of the Neo4p13 locus remained relatively tight at approximately 90–100 kb even as this centromere moved (Fig. 1d,e). As the CENP-A domain drifts in one direction, CENP-A nucleosomes are depleted from the trailing end of the domain (for example, Fig. 1d, clones 1.2 and 3.2). These observations suggest that mechanisms exist to tightly maintain centromere boundaries and size of this domain.

Source data

To understand how neocentromere position is maintained, we mapped the local chromatin environment surrounding the CENP-A domain. The RPE1-Neo4p13 cells are diploid, effectively carrying two distinct centromere epialleles, one at the canonical centromeric alpha-satellites of chromosome 4 and one at 4p13 (Fig. 1a). To accurately map chromatin features in a haplotype-specific manner, selectively at the neocentromere allele, we used Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)-based ultralong-read DiMelo-seq37, in combination with the cell-line-specific RPE1 reference genome39 (Fig. 2a). Neo4p13 maps to Chr4 haplotype 2 (Hap2), indicated by the presence of a 6mA peak at p13 on Hap2 specifically directed toward CENP-A and CENP-C (Fig. 2b–e). Consistent with our previous observations using ChIP-seq18, this locus is enriched with H3K9me3 on both haplotypes. Interestingly, seeding of the CENP-A domain resulted in the selective loss of H3K9me3 specifically at the neocentromere haplotype (Fig. 2c,g). We previously estimated around 100 CENP-A nucleosomes per haplotype in RPE1 cells40. Within a ~100-kb centromere domain, this translates to one in five nucleosomes containing CENP-A. Thus, while the loss of H3K9me3 is explained in part by the displacement of histone H3 by CENP-A, our findings suggest that CENP-A seeding also results in the active removal of H3K9 trimethylation.

Data are aggregated across a 500-kb region centered at the Neo4p13 coordinates, with flanking regions extending 250 kb on either side. Mean enrichment values are calculated in 100 evenly spaced bins per region. The x axis represents the genomic position relative to the midpoint (in kb), while the y axis indicates the % 6mA/A or 5mCG/C.

Canonical alpha-satellite-based centromeres are characterized by distinct dips in 5mCG methylation at regions with high CENP-A occupancy3,28,41. Using DiMeLo-seq, we can directly measure endogenous 5mCG on the same single molecules on which we measure exogenous 6mA deposited around H3K9me3 or CENP-A. We found that the neocentromere arose in a broad domain of generally low DNA methylation (Fig. 2b,c,f). Strikingly, the formation of the CENP-A domain induced the removal of the remaining 5mCG methylation, specifically on the CENP-A-containing haplotype (Fig. 2b,c,f). While we cannot directly establish causality, our data on a newly formed neocentromere suggest that CENP-A seeding can specifically drive local CpG demethylation (Fig. 2c–e).

Previously, we determined that the overall A+T content of the 4p13 neocentromere region is roughly equal to that of the chromosome average18. Here, we analyzed the distribution of transposable elements (TEs) that have previously been implicated in centromere function, although the roles of TEs have been elusive42. Using the diploid RPE1 genome39, we characterized the genome-wide TE distribution using RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org). We found that the 4p13 neocentromere locus features a higher number of long terminal repeats (LTRs) versus the chromosomal averages for Chr4 Hap2 (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b), most of which are present near the telomere-proximal side of the CENP-A peak (Extended Data Fig. 1a). In contrast, long (LINEs) and short (SINEs) interspersed nuclear elements are closer to the genome average (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b).

We also analyzed the loci of previously characterized patient-derived neocentromeres on chromosomes 4, 8 and 13 (PDNC4, MS4221 and IMS13q, respectively)26,27. Unlike Neo4p13, the PDNC4 neocentromere at 4q21 is enriched in SINEs, with only a minor increase in LTRs (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d). IMS13q on chromosome 13 showed a slight enrichment for LINEs (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). Interestingly, at MS4221, although overall depleted in LINEs, CENP-A maps precisely onto LINE1 elements at this neocentromere (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h), consistent with earlier observations43. Thus, while interspersed repeats are generally associated with neocentromere activity, there appears to be no unique repeat linked to centromere function. In all cases analyzed, there were numerous other regions across the chromosome that feature higher numbers of all three TE classes (Extended Data Fig. 1), making TEs unlikely to be defining features of neocentromeres. Furthermore, not all neocentromere-forming regions appear to be strongly enriched in broad domains of H3K9me3. Known patient-derived neocentromeres on chromosomes 4q and 13q have appeared in regions that, at least in our RPE genome analysis, are depleted of H3K9me3 or contain more refined H3K9me3 peaks rather than a broad domain of H3K9me3 (Extended Data Fig. 1c,e). These lower levels of H3K9me3 were also observed at different neocentromeres across the 13q arm27, as well as at the 4q21 neocentromere, where variation in H3K9m3 levels correlates with changes in CENP-A position44.

Given the maintenance of size control of the 4p13 neocentromere that we observed in long-term culture, we hypothesized that adjacent H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin forms an effective boundary (Fig. 3a). We predicted that the H3K9me3 methyltransferases SUV39H1 and SUV39H2 may be responsible for maintaining the heterochromatin domain at 4p13, as these are known to mark pericentric heterochromatin at canonical centromeres45,46,47. We also considered the H3K9me3 methyltransferase SETDB1 as a putative candidate, as this enzyme is known to have roles distinct from SUV39 enzymes, particularly in TE silencing47,48,49.

We constructed SETDB1-null (SETDB1Δ) and SUV39H1/H2-double-null mutant lines (SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ). Loss of SUV39H1/H2 resulted in a modest reduction in global H3K9me3 levels, likely because of other H3K9 methyltransferases (Fig. 3b). In contrast, SETDB1 loss did not affect overall H3K9me3 levels detectable by immunoblot (Fig. 3b). Using H3K9me3-directed CUT&RUN, we found that deletion of SUV39H1/H2 but not SETDB1 resulted in the near-complete loss of H3K9me3 from the neocentromere domain, except for some discrete H3K9me3 peaks (Fig. 3c). While the CENP-A domain maintained its position in SETDB1 mutants (Fig. 3g–i, red tracks), loss of H3K9me3 in SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ cells resulted in a substantial drift of the CENP-A domain in a telomere-proximal direction, following the generation and expansion of mutant cells (~50 days in culture) with a telomere-proximal peak center shift of 14.2 kb (Fig. 3d–f, red tracks).

To assess long-term adaptation, we used the clonal culture strategy, outlined in Fig. 1. Following an additional 100 days of continuous proliferation, all SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ clones moved to a more telomere-proximal position compared to parental Neo4p13 (Fig. 3d–f, gray tracks), with an average shift of the peak center of 22.6 kb. Moreover, CENP-A enrichment is generally higher across all clones versus parental early-passage cells. Importantly, the overall size of the CENP-A domain remained largely consistent at 90–110 kb in evolved clones, suggesting another layer of size control that maintains neocentromere size, preventing spreading beyond a confined locus.

While deletion of SETDB1 did not result in notable changes in H3K9me3 and CENP-A positioning initially, analysis of 100-day long-term passaged clones revealed extensive heterogeneity in CENP-A position, in either direction, with a mean shift of peak center of 30.2 kb (Fig. 3g–i, gray tracks). The drift in CENP-A occurred without apparent changes in initial H3K9me3 levels (Fig. 3c). To determine whether SETDB1 possibly has a redundant role in regulating H3K9me3 at the 4p13 neocentromere, we compared H3K9me3 CUT&RUN data in SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ, SETDB1Δ and combined SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ/SETDB1Δ mutant backgrounds (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Upon removal of SUV39H1 and SUV39H12, there remained some more refined H3K9me3 peaks near LTRs within the Neo4p13 region that were removed upon additional SETDB1 deletion. These findings suggest that SETDB1 has a more subtle role in silencing TE elements in this region and a contributing role in maintaining CENP-A boundaries.

We also analyzed the role of H3K9me3 modifiers in heterochromatin distribution at other RPE1 loci known to be associated with patient-derived neocentromeres (PDNC4, IMSq13 and MS4221)26. We found that the discrete H3K9me3 peaks surrounding the PDNC4 and IMSq13 neocentromere loci were largely dependent on SETDB1 (Extended Data Fig. 1c,e). In contrast, H3K9me3 at the MS4221 neocentromere locus appeared more broadly SUV39-regulated (Extended Data Fig. 1g). Thus, neocentromere loci appear to be at least in part influenced by SETDB1 and/or SUV39H1/H2 activity.

Loss of H3K9me3 may result in compensatory modes of heterochromatinization. Indeed, we observed an increase in Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated H3K27me3 facultative heterochromatin upon loss of SUV39-mediated H3K9me3 at 4p13 (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 5a), consistent with previous studies29, a phenomenon also observed on H3K9me3-depleted human artificial chromosomes50. To remove H3K27me3, we disrupted the gene encoding suppressor of zeste 12 (SUZ12), an essential component of the PRC2 complex (Fig. 3b)51. Deletion of SUZ12 resulted in a complete loss of H3K27me3 in SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ/SUZ12Δ triple-mutant Neo4p13 cells (Fig. 3b,c). Strikingly, size control of the CENP-A domain is largely lost in this context, resulting in a doubling in size compared to the original Neo4p13 locus (Fig. 3j–l). CENP-A moves much further than in SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ to a size up to 150 kb and breaching into the nearest gene boundary (GRXCR1), with a mean peak center shift of 41.3 kb. Combined, these results indicate that heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 can form clear functional boundaries at this neocentromere and maintain tight size control of the CENP-A domain, independent of 5mCG methylation and alpha-satellites.

Next, we investigated whether similar boundary mechanisms exist at canonical centromeres. Characteristic features of canonical centromeres, such as repetitive alpha-satellite DNA and high levels of DNA methylation, may also contribute to maintaining CENP-A positioning. To assess chromatin organization at highly repetitive satellite DNA, we used ONT ultralong-read DiMelo-seq in combination with the isogenomic RPE reference genome39 to accurately map CENP-A, CENP-C and H3K9me3 occupancy at canonical centromeres (Fig. 4a)37. We performed this analysis in the same RPE1-Neo4p13-bearing cell line for consistency across our experiments. As ONT enables direct genomic DNA sequencing lacking PCR amplification, we can determine the single-molecule occupancy of our target of interest across centromeres or pericentromeres.

The start and end of the HOR regions are indicated, highlighting methylation patterns in and around these active centromeric domains. e, Heat maps as in d but specifically across CDRs, as defined by the boundary of 5mCG dips on either side of each CENP-A-containing region.

To determine the specificity of the CENP-A DiMelo-seq 6mA signal, we used an endogenous homozygous knock-in AID-eYFP-CENP-A hTERT-RPE1 cell line to auxin-deplete all endogenous CENP-A52, followed by CENP-A DiMeLo-seq (Extended Data Fig. 2a). CENP-A was effectively depleted from cells (Extended Data Fig. 2b) and the corresponding CENP-A 6mA signal was specifically eliminated from all CDRs, indicating that 6mA is CENP-A specific and providing us with a true background CENP-A 6mA/A signal (Extended Data Fig. 2c,e,f). Consistent with previous observations3,28,53, active alpha-satellite HOR arrays generally contained high levels of DNA methylation (Fig. 4b–f, blue). Moreover, active centromeric regions containing CENP-A featured the previously characterized CDRs, depleted of 5mCG, which tightly inversely correlate with all CENP-A (red) and CENP-C (orange) containing regions (Fig. 4b,c,f). Interestingly, 5mCG levels were unaffected by acute loss of CENP-A (Extended Data Fig. 2d–f), indicating that the local dip in DNA methylation is relatively stable, at least within a few hours of CENP-A depletion.

H3K9me3 is normally present in high densities in pericentric regions in classical constitutive HP1-mediated heterochromatin domains54,55,56. To determine the resolution of our H3K9me3 DiMeLo-seq, we first assessed H3K9me3 in pericentric regions, specifically using HSat3 as an example (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We could achieve near-single-nucleosome resolution for H3K9me3, giving us an estimate of methylated nucleosome densities in these regions that is consistent with the reported average chromatin repeat unit length for HSat3 (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c)57.

In the classic centric–pericentric dichotomy, heterochromatin, marked by H3K9me3, is considered to be largely pericentric, whereas the kinetochore-forming CENP-A domain is largely depleted of heterochromatin29,30,35,58. Moreover, centromeres on human artificial chromosomes resist silencing mediated by H3K3me3 and H3K27me3 (ref. 50) and H3K9me3 is not required for CENP-A-driven epigenetic memory59, suggesting an inverse relationship and functional boundary potential. However, using DiMeLo-seq, it was unambiguously shown that H3K9me3 is also present within HORs that form a template for CENP-A37. Consistent with these data, we found high levels of H3K9me3 across all pericentromeres and active HORs in RPE1 (Fig. 4b,c,d, green). Importantly, we identified a distinct depletion in H3K9me3 within the CENP-A domain at all centromeres, forming a tight boundary around the CENP-A/CENP-C domain in a manner analogous to 5mCG (Fig. 4c,e,f and Extended Data Fig. 4). Thus, the CDR is defined not only by depletion of 5mCG but also by a dip in the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3.

To uncover the importance of heterochromatin boundaries at canonical alpha-satellite-based centromeres, we assessed H3K9me3 levels in the SETDB1Δ, SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ and SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ/SUZ12Δ double and triple mutants described above. We found that, in SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ double mutants, H3K9me3 levels were decreased both across the flanking pericentromere and within centromeric active HORs, compared to parental cells (Fig. 5a,c). Surprisingly, we found that SETDB1 contributes to H3K9me3 deposition specifically within the centromeric HORs and not in the flanking pericentric regions (Fig. 5a,c), indicating it has centromere-specific roles distinct from SUV39 enzymes.

SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ/SUZ12Δ triple mutants offered the most prominent effect on H3K9me3. Whilst levels were reduced in the pericentromeric regions to similar levels as in SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ double-mutant cells, there was a striking and substantial loss of H3K9me3 that specifically affected active HORs, even beyond that observed in SETDB1Δ cells (Fig. 5a,c). Hence, whilst loss of SUV39H1 and SUV39H2 generally reduced H3K9me3 in pericentric and alpha-satellite-containing chromatin, SETDB1 and SUZ12 deletion appeared to have selective effects on alpha-satellite H3K9me3.

Next, we determined whether loss of H3K9me3 in SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ and SETDB1Δ mutants resulted in compensation by H3K27me3, assessed by DiMeLo-seq. We found no strong enrichment for the PRC2-mediated mark within the HOR in parental active HORs (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c, top). Loss of H3K9me3 in SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ and SETDB1Δ mutants did not result in any compensatory H3K27me3 deposition, except for pericentric, divergent satellites in SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ (Extended Data Fig. 5b–e). These observations indicate that the contributing role of SUZ12 to maintaining H3K9m3 in SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ mutants is not mediated by H3K27me3 but possibly through a direct noncanonical contribution of this PRC2 subunit to heterochromatin maintenance.

We then analyzed the effect of heterochromatin mutants on H3K9me3 boundaries at the CENP-A-containing DNA methylation-depleted regions (CDRs). We found local H3K9me3 boundaries to be effectively eliminated in SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ/SUZ12Δ backgrounds, with visible reductions in boundary strength also apparent in SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ and SETDB1Δ (Fig. 5b,d). Importantly, the 5mCG-defined CDRs were largely maintained (Fig. 5b,d). Therefore, in this context, we primarily assessed the contributions of H3K9me3 to centromere position, largely independent of the role of DNA methylation or H3K27me3 chromatin.

Next, having established means to selectively deplete heterochromatin from active HORs and pericentric HSats, we assessed its contribution to CENP-A positioning. In parental cells, we observed a tight positioning of CENP-A and CENP-C within the CDR, with levels rapidly dropping off outside of the 5mCG CDR boundaries (Figs. 4f and 6a,b,f). In SETDB1Δ, SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ and SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ/SUZ12Δ mutants, we observed a notable overall expansion of CENP-A following ~50 days in culture (time to generate these knockouts) (Fig. 6a–d,f). The majority of centromeres moved beyond their original CDR boundaries of parental cells, most prominently in the SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ/SUZ12Δ triple-mutant cells, where H3K9me3 levels were the most reduced. The CENP-A enrichment ratio within versus outside the CDR in control samples dropped in both mutants (Fig. 6d), even below a ratio of 1 in many centromeres, indicating that CENP-A became more enriched in the surrounding 100-kb region than within the originally defined centromere boundaries.

Quantitative analysis of 6mA read density normalized to IgG (Extended Data Fig. 6) across the HORs revealed that CENP-A and CENP-C density was largely maintained within CENP-A peaks in SETDB1Δ and increased in SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ conditions (Fig. 6g). Notably, CENP-A and CENP-C densities did not fall below parental density, indicating that the total copy number of CENP-A nucleosomes (and, to a lesser extent, CENP-C) across HORs was increased rather than diluted across the expanded CDRs (Fig. 6g). Interestingly, the DNA methylation dips were largely maintained, even if H3K9me3 levels were uniformly low across the CDR and adjacent HORs (Figs. 5d and 6a,e). Nevertheless, we could observe erosion of 5mCG at the centromere boundaries, with a mean increase in CDR size of 18% (SETDB1Δ), 19% (SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ) and 56% (SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ/SUZ12Δ), indicating that the H3K9me3-depositing machinery had an indirect effect on DNA methylation (Fig. 6e). In summary, the expansion of CENP-A correlates with the loss of H3K9me3 and, to a lesser extent, with a reduction in DNA methylation at the boundary. These observations indicate that H3K9me3 heterochromatin is the primary functional boundary maintaining CENP-A position.

We find that, in heterochromatin mutants, the dip in DNA methylation (CDR) is largely maintained (Fig. 5b). Nevertheless, the tight correlation between the CENP-A domain and reduced DNA methylation3,28,41 suggest a functional link. Indeed, recent experiments directly implicated CpG methylation in maintaining CENP-A levels and boundaries60. The de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B is associated with centromeric and pericentromeric components in various contexts, including CENP-C61, Mis18α (ref. 62), HP1α (ref. 45) and SUV39H1 (ref. 45). We deleted DNMT3B in parental and SETDB1Δ backgrounds to assess any individual or combinatorial contributions toward CENP-A position (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Whilst DNMT3BΔ generally reduced 5mCG methylation in the active HOR by 26% (Extended Data Fig. 7b), CENP-A position remained relatively constant at the vast majority of centromeres (Extended Data Fig. 7d,f). The removal of DNMT3B in the context of a SETDB1 mutant in which heterochromatin boundaries are eroded resulted in a more notable loss of CENP-A domain definition (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d,h). For instance, in the absence of SETDB1, loss of DNMT3B led to CENP-A-invaded monomeric satellite regions flanking the active HOR at CEN16 Hap1 (characterized by non-5mCG-methylated adjacent satellites) (Extended Data Fig. 7c,e,g). These results indicate a role for DNMT3B in maintaining DNA methylation, particularly when heterochromatin boundaries are defective.

Given our observations that Neo4p13 drifts gradually over time (Fig. 1d), we sought to determine whether canonical centromeres display a similar behavior. We picked a parental clone (clone 1.2; Fig. 1d) and SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ/SUZ12Δ clone (clone 1.2; Fig. 3j) in which the CENP-A domain at the Neo4p13 locus shifted substantially following 100 days of proliferation. We then performed CENP-A DiMelo-seq to determine any differences in CENP-A position and size over time. Similar to the neocentromere, canonical centromeres move subtly with time over the 100-day period (Extended Data Fig. 8). Parental centromere length (Extended Data Fig. 8c) and CDR boundary definition (Extended Data Fig. 8e) were largely maintained or subtly eroded after 100 days. CENP-A position began to gradually shift from the initial centromere boundary (Extended Data Fig. 8d,f). In contrast, already in early-passage SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ/SUZ12Δ cells and in day 100 clones, the CENP-A domain shifted substantially beyond any drift observed in parental cells, even following 100 days of proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 8d,f). In addition, centromere length expanded (Extended Data Fig. 8c) and CDR definition was greatly eroded (Extended Data Fig. 8e) in these clones. We also observed cases where CENP-A position almost entirely vacated the parental position in the SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ/SUZ12Δ 100-day background (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). Interestingly, here, 5mCG methylation began to reoccupy the initial CDR in the absence of CENP-A (Extended Data Fig. 8a, bottom). This suggests that, in addition to our observation at the neocentromere, where seeding CENP-A coincides with a loss of DNA methylation, the inverse can also happen, where the gradual loss of CENP-A results in the reestablishment of DNA methylation. Moreover, our assessment of long-term CENP-A domain dynamics indicates that the dramatic movement of CENP-A in methyltransferase mutants is the result of the loss of these enzymes and not simply a consequence of clonal selection and long-term culture.

In addition to the expansion of existing CENP-A boundaries, we observed many cases where the loss of heterochromatin resulted in entirely new CENP-A peaks. These formed distal to the primary CENP-A domain but within the same alpha-satellite HORs and correlated with the loss of 5mCG and H3K9me3, thus forming characteristically similar chromatin features to the primary active centromere or CDR. For example, CEN1 and CEN9 of SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ/SUZ12Δ both contained new CDRs ~3 Mb away from the original primary CDR (Fig. 7a). SETDB1Δ cells similarly showed specific examples of new CDRs at CEN19 and CEN20 (Fig. 7a). Furthermore, the presence of the key CCAN component CENP-C indicates that these ectopic CENP-A domains are likely functionally active as centromeres (Fig. 7a). Thorough analysis using CDR-Finder63 followed by manual curation (Methods) identified all new CENP-A-containing CDRs that formed distally on the same alpha-satellite HOR in SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ/SUZ12Δ and SETDB1Δ mutants (Supplementary Table 1) and two new CDRs in DNMT3BΔ. A new CENP-A peak was also present on CEN21 Hap1 of parental cells following 100 days of culture, suggesting that new CENP-A domain seeding could be a general phenomenon that occurs at low frequency even in wild-type cells over time. Noticeably, some HOR regions appear to be preferred sites for new CENP-A domain formation across our cell lines (for example, Chr9, Chr20 and Chr21). No new CDRs appeared in SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ cells.

The primary and newly formed centromeres are highlighted in each case, corresponding with new CENP-A and CENP-C seeding and 5mCG and H3K9me3 dips (representative of n = 2 independent validations). b, Representative immunofluorescence and mFISH images of metaphase spreads, showing karyotype and dicentric chromosomes for SETDB1Δ and SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ/SUZ12Δ cells as per a, identified by CENP-C (orange) and chromosome-specific mFISH paint. Scale bar, 10 μm (n = 2 independent experiments, with a minimum of 20 nuclei per replicate). c, Model summarizing the differential role of H3K9me3 methyltransferases at neocentromeres and canonical centromeres and their role in defining CENP-A domain size, position and number. Left, loss of SUV39H1/H2-mediated heterochromatin (H3K9me3) and compensatory H3K27me3 (PRC2) at Neo4p13 results in expansion and drift of the neocentromere. SETDB1 contributes to localized H3K9me3, possibly at TEs. Right, loss of H3K9me3 at canonical alpha-satellite centromeres leads to centromere expansion, drift and nucleation of new centromeres at distal sites on the alpha-satellite, creating new CDRs. SUV39H1/H2 broadly contributes to H3K9me3 deposition, while SETDB1 and SUZ12 action is largely restricted to HORs.

We found all mutant lines to generally maintain a diploid karyotype as measured by DNA content (Extended Data Fig. 9a), although we observed a small polyploid population in the SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ double-mutant and SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ/SUZ12Δ triple-mutant cells (Extended Data Fig. 9a). We did not observe new CENP-A domains and CDRs in the SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ, indicating that polyploidy of these cells is not directly linked to ectopic CENP-A domains but rather to other defects, induced by heterochromatin loss. Furthermore, using spectral karyotyping, we identified translocations and aneuploidies of specific chromosomes across each cell line (Extended Data Fig. 9b–d). However, we did not find that the translocations resulted from centromeric breakages and appeared to occur independently of new CENP-A peaks. We observed some instances of HOR destabilization not observed in parental cells (for example, CEN9 Hap2 in SETDB1Δ; Fig. 7a). However, the majority of HORs appeared stable and translocation events appeared not to be directly linked to centromere defects.

Lastly, to determine whether the ectopic CENP-A peaks form distinct centromere domains, we directly visualized these new centromeres on mitotic chromosomes. Using a combination of multicolor FISH (mFISH) and immunofluorescence for CENP-C, we could resolve dicentric chromosomes in metaphase spreads for chromosomes 1 and 9 of SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ/SUZ12Δ mutants and chromosomes 19 and 20 in SETDB1Δ cells. Here, CENP-C appeared as distinct double loci at these centromeres (Fig. 7b, orange), corresponding to the new CENP-A and CENP-C DiMeLo-seq peaks (Fig. 7a), indicating that these loci form functional dicentrics with two spatially adjacent CENP-A domains within the same alpha-satellite array.

In this study, we discovered that the human neocentromere Neo4p13 (ref. 18) is enriched in SUV39H1-dependent and SUV39H2-dependent H3K9me3 but is formed in generally low levels of DNA methylation and lacks alpha-satellites, indicating that the latter are not the primary contributors to centromere positioning, at least at this neocentromere. We found that both H3K9me3 and redundant H3K27me3 within this domain form effective boundaries, preventing CENP-A domain drift and expansion (Fig. 7c).

We hypothesize that these heterochromatin marks are maintained through self-templated propagation, forming a competitive, incompatible barrier for CENP-A deposition. In this context, it is interesting to note that treatment with an HDAC inhibitor and resulting increase in histone acetylation were also shown to cause CENP-A domain movements at a human neocentromere, an early indicator that changes to heterochromatin affect centromere boundaries64. We found that, while loss of SETDB1 had little impact on H3K9me3, it results in movement of the CENP-A domain, indicating that a subtle impact on H3K9me3 levels (particularly at TEs) may have notable consequences for the centromere boundaries (Fig. 7c). Alternatively, SETDB1 may impact other aspects of chromatin, such as H3K9me2, as recently identified at the centromere65, or possibly a nonenzymatic role, which requires further investigation.

As at the 4p13 neocentromere, we found H3K9me3 chromatin to be depleted within the CENP-A domains at satellites, correlating with a dip in CpG methylation. Perturbation of these H3K9me3 boundaries resulted in substantial movement and expansion of CENP-A domains at all centromeres. Importantly, while loss of H3K9me resulted in some erosion of CpG methylation at the CDR boundary, the DNA methylation dips were largely maintained. Recent work showed that strong and rapid depletion of DNA methylation within centromeric HORs results in an increase in CENP-A assembly within the CDR and alterations to CENP-A boundary definition60. Our work now demonstrates that DNA methylation may not act as the sole boundary to maintain the CENP-A domain and heterochromatin has a critical role in restricting the functional CENP-A domain, particularly at the long timescales we analyzed.

Centromeric and pericentromeric repeats are largely repressed by H3K9me3-associated chromatin37,54,55. How H3K9me3 is regulated within the centromere has remained unclear. Our data support a general role for SUV39 methyltransferases at both pericentric HSat sequences and centromeric alpha-satellites. A role for SETDB1 was also recently observed at centromeres in K562 leukemia cells65. We discovered that SETDB1 acts as a methyltransferase primarily at active alpha-satellite HORs (Fig. 7c). SETDB1 is known to drive heterochromatinization and silence TEs47,48,49. While the reason for the HOR-specific effect is unknown, active HORs, like TEs, are highly methylated compared to adjacent inactive arrays3,28. Possibly, the high degree of methylation contributes to SETDB1 recruitment. While pure alpha-satellites enriched in CENP-A are usually devoid of TEs3, they may nevertheless share similar features. For instance, members of the diverse family of zinc finger DNA-binding factors that normally recruit SETDB1 complexes to TEs were recently implicated in heterochromatin initiation and directly bind pericentric DNA in a sequence-specific manner66. Understanding whether cryptic sequences within active HORs contribute toward SETDB1 targeting is an important future goal.

We also identified an important role for the PRC2 component SUZ12 in the regulation of centromeric satellites, independent of H3K27me3, the product of the canonical SUZ12-containing PRC2 complex (Fig. 7c). Indeed, it was previously shown that SUZ12 regulates H3K9 methylation and HP1α distribution in flies67. Furthermore, proteomic analyses found PRC2 components enriched on H3K9me3 chromatin, indicating extensive overlap in H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 binding profiles68,69. Both EZH2 methyltransferase and SUZ12 appear to be required for HP1 protein stability, and HP1 binding to H3K9me3 peptides is greatly increased in the presence of H3K27me3 (ref. 70). On the basis of this functional overlap, loss of SUZ12 may destabilize and erode H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin, consistent with our observations. While we cannot exclude the secondary effects of long-term gene deletions in this study, these observations suggest a possible direct functional interaction among SETDB1, SUV39 and SUZ12 at centromeric repeats, which requires further careful biochemical and genetic dissection.

Prior evidence suggests that centromere nucleation is a concentration-dependent mechanism5,6, requiring a critical concentration of CENPs to trigger an active centromere state. Indeed, CENP-A is loaded onto chromatin at low concentrations outside the centromere40,71,72 but is removed through DNA replication except at the centromere71. A key function of repressive chromatin surrounding the active centromeric locus may be to maintain a high local concentration of CENP-A. Our discovery of new CENP-A domains distal to the primary CDR, which appear to form functional centromeres in heterochromatin-deficient mutants, is consistent with a role for heterochromatin and DNA methylation60, not only in acting as a boundary at existing CENP-A domains but also in suppressing aberrant centromere formation at regions outside of the primary active centromere locus. As centromeric transcription appears to be implicated in CENP-A function73 and is indeed activated upon centromere repositioning74, one possible role of H3K9me3 and DNA methylation may be to constrain centromeric transcription and associated chromatin remodeling specifically within CDRs, where CENP-A assembles.

The new CENP-A domains we observe in heterochromatin mutants occur within the HOR and likely act as functional dicentrics that are mitotically stable and generally permissive to chromosome segregation, consistent with previous work75. Nevertheless, multiple CENP-A domains within the HOR may affect mitotic fidelity, particularly inducing merotelically because of a loss of a tight bioriented centromere architecture76. Moreover, the recent description of the bipartite organization of the centromere and kinetochore may be impacted by ectopic CENP-A domains, even if proximal to the canonical site, which may impact chromosome segregation fidelity77.

In sum, we identified heterochromatin and its associated H3K9 methyltransferases as an important contributor to maintaining CENP-A boundaries. How these boundaries are set at the remarkably constant size of about 100 kb, independent of underlying sequence context, remains an open question. Possibly, the assembly of the multiprotein centromere complex and the functional kinetochore tie into control mechanisms dynamically dictating the number of CENP-A nucleosomes, as we recently discussed78. Understanding the dynamic feedback involving CENP-A chromatin, its boundaries and the centromere–kinetochore complex is an important future goal.

All human cell lines were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2. RPE1 cell lines were grown in DMEM/F-12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 1× nonessential amino acids (Gibco), 2 mM glutamine (Gibco), 100 U per ml penicillin (Gibco) and 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin (Gibco). HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco).

The RPE-Neo4p13 cell line was generated as previously described18. For SUV39H1/H2, SETDB1 and DNMT3B deletion in the RPE-Neo4p13 background, guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed (Supplementary Table 2; synthesized by Merk Life Sciences) and cloned into LentiCRISPRv2-Blast (Addgene, 83480) according to the standard lentiCRISPRv2 cloning protocol79. Lentivirus was produced in HEK293T cells in a T25 flask using a plasmid mixture (0.62 µg of pMD2 (Addgene, 12259), 1.87 µg of psPAX2 (Addgene, 12260) and 2.5 µg of pLentiCRSPRv2), transfected with Lipofectamine LTX. The virus supernatant was then harvested, filtered through a 0.45-µm filter and either frozen at −80 °C or used immediately. For transduction, RPE-Neo4p13 cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells per well in a six-well plate the day before infection. Filtered viral supernatant was mixed with antibiotic-free medium, supplemented with 3.2 µl of 10 mg ml−1 polybrene and added to the cells for 48 h. After infection, cells were washed four times with PBS, replaced with regular medium and, if required, treated with the 5 µg ml−1 blasticidin for 5 days. Cells were then clonally sorted into 96-well plates, grown out and screened by immunoblot for positive clonal knockouts for each target.

For generation of the SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ/SUZ12Δ cell line, SUZ12 gRNAs (Supplementary Table 2) were designed and cloned into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (PX458) plasmid using the standard Zhang lab gRNA insertion protocol80. Clonal SUV39H1Δ/H2Δ cells were transiently reverse cotransfected with PX458 using the Mirus TransIT-LT1 protocol at a 2:1 ratio of reagent to DNA in a six-well plate at a density of 6 × 104 cells per well. After 48 h, cells were sorted for high GFP expression into a polyclonal population and allowed to recover for 1 week. When cells were proliferating, cells were clonally sorted (GFP-negative) into 96-well plates and allowed to expand, followed by screening by immunoblot for clones in which both SUZ12 and resulting H3K27me3 were lost.

For FACS and cytometry, cells were harvested by centrifuging at 500g for 5 min and resuspended in ice-cold sorting medium, which consisted of 1% FBS in PBS, supplemented with 0.25 mg ml−1 Fungizone (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.25 μg ml−1 amphotericin B and 10 μg ml−1 gentamicin (Gibco). The cell suspension was filtered through 5-ml polystyrene round-bottom tubes equipped with cell-strainer caps (Falcon) before sorting and analysis using the FACSAria III or FACSAria Fusion cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Sorted cells were collected into 96-well plates containing conditional medium, prepared as a 1:1 mix of fresh complete medium and 0.45-μm-filtered medium from proliferating cell cultures, supplemented with 20% FBS, 0.25 mg ml−1 Fungizone (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.25 μg ml−1 amphotericin B and 10 μg ml−1 gentamicin (Gibco).

For cell-cycle analysis, cells were harvested and washed with PBS. Fixation was performed by adding 1 ml of cold 70% ethanol dropwise to the cell pellet while vortexing to ensure thorough fixation and minimize clumping. Cells were fixed for at least 30 min on ice. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS. To selectively stain DNA, cells were treated with 50 µl of RNase A, followed by the addition of 400 µl of propidium iodide solution (50 µg ml−1) per million cells directly to the RNase-A-treated pellet. The samples were mixed thoroughly and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The stained samples were analyzed by flow cytometry and data were collected from at least 20,000 single cells per condition. Data were analyzed using FlowJo version 10.8 (BD Life Sciences).

Cell pellets were resuspended in RIPA buffer, incubated for 20 min on ice and then centrifuged at 15,000g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube; protein concentration was measured with a Bradford assay and adjusted to the same concentration. Samples were resuspended to 1× sample buffer (125 mM Tris–HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 0.2% (w/v) orange G and 10% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. Then, 10 µg of protein was loaded per lane in a 4–20% SDS–PAGE gel (BioRad), followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (BioRad Transblot Turbo). Membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) milk or BSA in TBS-T (20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight with gentle rocking. Membranes were washed three times with TBS-T for 10 min each, followed by incubation with secondary antibody diluted in 5% (w/v) milk or BSA in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking, followed by washing three times with TBS-T for 10 min each. For fluorescent antibodies, membranes were visualized with an Odyssey Fc gel imager (LI-COR). For horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondaries (Extended Data Fig. 3b), enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (BioRad Clarity ECL reagent, 1705061) was used for detection and membranes were visualized on X-ray films (Cytiva, GE28-9068-37), developed on an OPTIMAX 2010 X-ray film processor (PROTAC-Med). Primary and secondary antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 3.

CENP-A, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 CUT&RUN were performed natively with 5 × 105 cells using the CUTANA ChIC/CUT&RUN kit (EpiCypher, 14-1048) according to the manufacturer's protocol (version 3, 4 or 5). The following antibodies and concentrations were used: CENP-A (Enzo, ADI-KAM-CC006, 1:50), H3K9me3 (Abcam, ab8898, 1:50) and H3K27me3 (C36B11, 1:50) (Supplementary Table 3). DNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA library prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) following the published protocol. For multiplexing, we used NEBNext multiplex oligos for Illumina (index primer sets 1 and 2). Size selection was performed using Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) to isolate mononucleosomal DNA fragments of approximately 150–180 bp (excluding adaptors). Library yield and quality were evaluated using the Qubit HS double-stranded DNA quantification assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the TapeStation 4150 System (Agilent). Multiplexed libraries were diluted to final concentrations of 1, 2 or 4 nM and sequenced at 1.8 pM on a NextSeq 500 system (Illumina) with the NextSeq 500/550 high output version 2.5 (75 cycles) kit (Illumina).

For the analysis of CUT&RUN data, raw FASTQ files were downloaded and concatenated per sample using basic Unix commands. Read quality was assessed using Basespace (Illumina) and FastQC software81. Reads were then aligned to the RPE1 genome using Bowtie2 (ref. 82), with trimming parameters adjusted on the basis of read quality. SAM-to-BAM file conversion, BAM sorting and indexing were carried out using SAMtools (version 1.16)83. Duplicate reads were removed using the MarkDuplicates command in Picard (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). The resulting sorted and duplicate-removed BAM files were used to calculate read counts, normalize data (counts per million) and convert to BigWig format using the bamCoverage command in deepTools (version 2)84. BigWig files were visualized using Integrative Genomics Viewer and with pyGenomeTracks85. Read count matrices were generated using the multiBigWigSummary command in deepTools (version 2) and the output was visualized using matplotlib.

Mouse and Rabbit MBP–nanobody–Hia5–6×His constructs were a gift from A. Straight (Stanford University)86. MBP–nanobody–Hia5 proteins were overexpressed by rhamnose induction in BL21 DE3 cells for 16–20 h at 18 °C before harvesting by centrifugation. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and 0.5% Triton X-100) with one ETDA-free protease inhibitor tablet per liter of culture. The cells were then lysed by probe sonication (Qsonica Q125; six pulses, 30 s on and 1 min off at 200 W). After a clearance centrifugation at 40,000g for 1 h, the supernatant was added to washed Ni-NTA beads and mixed for 1 h at 4 °C. The slurry was added to a gravity flow column and washed with 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 300 mM NaCl followed by 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole. The protein was eluted by 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl and 250 mM imidazole in 30ml and confirmed by SDS–PAGE. The elution was then dialyzed to remove the imidazole at 4 °C overnight in 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT. After dialysis, the protein was concentrated, filtered and applied to a Recourse Q anion-exchange column. After confirmation of protein purity by SDS–PAGE, the protein was concentrated to 1 mg ml−1, snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C until use.

DiMeLo-seq was performed according to the standard protocol in Maslan et al.87 with some minor changes; all buffer compositions followed the published protocol. Briefly, 6 × 106 RPE cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1× PBS. For acute IAA experiments and CENP-C DiMeLo-seq, cells were fixed with 0.1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) by adding 6.2 µl of 16% PFA to 1 ml of suspension, followed by gentle vortexing for 2 min. Fixation was quenched with 1.25 M glycine (60 µl per 1 ml of suspension), followed by centrifugation at 500g for 3 min at 4 °C, supernatant removal and resuspension in Dig-Wash buffer (0.02% digitonin). All other samples were performed natively as per the published protocol (antibodies and concentrations in Supplementary Table 3).

HMW genomic DNA was extracted using the NEB Monarch HMW DNA extraction kit for tissue, resuspending in a final volume of 750 µl of EEB buffer (ONT). This 750-µl volume was then taken forward to the tagmentation step as per the standard SQK-ULK114 protocol. CENP-A and H3K9me3 DiMeLo-seq DNA was sequenced on a PromethION 2 Solo device (ONT) with R10.4.1 flow cells with adaptive sampling for all centromeres and all of Chr4 to depths of 25 Gb (CENP-A and Mouse IgG1κ) and 20 Gb (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, CENP-C and rabbit IgG).

Pod5 files were basecalled using dorado version 0.7.3 using the dorado basecaller sup@v4.3.0 for 6mA and 5mCG/5hmCG (https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado). Basecalled BAM files were then aligned to the RPE1 genome39 using dorado. Aligned BAM files were then sorted using SAMtools (version 1.16.1), filtered with SAMtools view -F 2308 to remove unmapped alignments (0 × 4), nonprimary alignments (0 × 100) and supplementary alignments (0 × 800), following by indexing. Indexed BAM files were then processed through a refModMatch script (https://github.com/altemoselab/miscTools/blob/main/refModMatch.py) to ensure we only kept bases in the MM tag if they were a match to the reference genome.

Next, 6mA and 5mCG modification filtering was performed using modkit (https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit) using modkit pileup with the following thresholds: --filter-threshold A:0.8 --mod-threshold a:0.98 --filter-threshold C:0.8 --mod-threshold m:0.8. The 6mA thresholds were tuned for specificity and signal-to-noise ratio using endogenous CENP-A auxin depletion (Extended Data Fig. 3) where endogenous CENP-A was fully depleted. BigWig files for visualization were generated from columns 1, 2, 3 and 11 (fraction modified) of the output bedmethyl file from modkit. To visualize single molecules, we used fibertools-rs (version 0.5.4; https://github.com/fiberseq/fibertools-rs)88 and used the ft extract tool to extract --m6A and --cpg motifs into a BED file with --ml 250 and --ml 204 thresholds, respectively, for each modification (in line with modkit filtering above). BigWig files and single-molecule tracks were visualized with pyGenomeTracks85.

Alpha-satellite annotations were previously identified using HumAS-HMMER For AnVIL (https://github.com/fedorrik/HumAS-HMMER_for_AnVIL)39. The resulting annotations were compared with CHM13 CenSat annotations3 to identify active, inactive and divergent HORs, as well as monomeric satellites, in the RPE1 genome. For analysis of active HORs in Figs. 4 and 5, active HOR annotations were lifted to include only the CDR/CENP-A-containing active HOR. Cases such as Cen3 (Hap1 and Hap2), Cen4 (Hap1) and Cen13 (Hap2), which contain multiple split active HORs, were contained to just the CENP-A-containing HOR. These CENP-A-containing active HORs were normalized to the same length, as described below, and plotted as active HOR ± 1 Mb, with flanking regions broadly defined as ‘pericentromere'.

To standardize regions of varying lengths for heat map analysis, each region was normalized to a fixed number of bins. Regions were extended symmetrically with upstream and downstream flanking areas. For active HORs, regions were normalized to 1,000 bins, with flanking pericentromeric regions (±1 Mb) divided into 500 bins each. CDRs were scaled to 200 bins, while each flank (±125 kb) was divided into 125 bins. Mean signal intensities for each bin were extracted from BigWig files using the pyBigWig.stats() function, with missing values replaced by NaN. The normalized signal profiles for all regions were combined into matrices for visualization, where each row represents a single active HOR or CDR, sorted numerically (for example, chr1_hap1, chr1_hap2, chr2_hap1, etc.).

CDRs were initially identified with CDR-Finder (https://github.com/EichlerLab/CDR-Finder)63 using the following parameters: height_perc_valley_threshold, 0.39; prom_perc_valley_threshold, 0.45. All other parameters were as per default test parameters. After initial CDR detection, each CDR BED file was manually inspected for accuracy and compared to CENP-A DiMelo-seq data. Any non-CENP-A-containing CDRs were manually removed. CDRs for Chr7 Hap1 and Chr10 Hap2 were manually annotated for accuracy. To ensure comparison of only primary CDRs, all nonprimary and newly formed CDRs were removed. The total length of each CDR was then summed and directly compared on a per-centromere basis to the corresponding parent centromere. To detect newly formed CDRs, the CDR-Finder63 output was manually inspected as above for accuracy, without removing nonprimary CDRs. All CDRs within 500 kb were merged and considered as one single centromere locus. Any CENP-A-containing CDRs not present in the parent CDR database were considered newly formed (that is, any new centromere peak more than 500 kb from the primary CDR site). The following chromosomes were not considered in all CDR analyses: Cen4 Hap2 (neocentromere-containing haplotype), CENX Hap2 (not present in genome), Cen18 Hap1 and Cen18 Hap2 (poorly defined CDRs).

CENP-A and CENP-C peaks were identified using a seeded expansion approach from preannotated CDRs (above). For each BigWig file containing 6mA/A-modified fraction data, the mean signal within each CDR was calculated and a threshold was set at 1% of this mean. A genomic window extending 30 kb beyond the CDR boundaries was loaded, with the signal smoothed using a 2-kb rolling average to mitigate noise. Starting from the CDR midpoint, boundaries were expanded left and right until the smoothed CENP-A/CENP-C signal fell below the threshold. Resulting peak annotations for each centromere were sorted and output as BED files.

To quantify 6mA density in detected CENP-A peaks, regions enriched for CENP-A relative to IgG controls, DiMeLo-seq reads in BED12 format from the fibertools extract were processed for each sample (parent, SUV39H1/H2Δ, SUV39H1/H2Δ/SUZ12Δ and SETDB1Δ). The BED12 file output from the fibertools extract provided the read's chromosome, start and end positions (columns 1–3), read name (column 4), block count (column 10, representing the number of 6mA sites), block sizes (column 11, typically 1 for point modifications) and relative block starts (column 12, indicating 6mA positions relative to the read start). Reads overlapping sample-specific CDR intervals by at least 10 kb (after excluding chromosomes chr4_2, chr18, chrX_2, chr13_2 and chr21_2) were identified and 6mA counts within these overlaps were tallied per molecule by checking whether each block's absolute position fell within the CDR boundaries. Density was computed as the number of 6mA sites per 10 kb of overlapping CDR sequence. Enrichment was calculated by dividing CENP-A densities by corresponding IgG control densities and plotted with matplotlib and seaborn.

Cells were treated with KaryoMAX Colcemid (100 ng ml−1, Gibco) for 3 h and mitotic cells were collected by mitotic shakeoff. To prepare cells for spreading, a 75 mM KCl solution was prewarmed in a 37 °C water bath and a fresh Carnoy fixative solution (methanol and acetic acid, 3:1) was prepared and placed on ice. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min and the supernatant was discarded, leaving a small residual volume in which the pellet was gently resuspended. For hypotonic treatment, 1 ml of 75 mM KCl (prewarmed to 37 °C) was slowly added to the cell suspension, followed by an additional 4 ml of the same solution. The tubes were incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 15 min, with gentle shaking once or twice during incubation to homogenize the solution. After incubation, the cells were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, leaving approximately 500 μl with the cell pellet and the tubes were immediately placed on ice.

To fix the cells, the pellet was gently resuspended in the residual supernatant. While the tube was vortexed at the lowest speed, 1,000 μl of ice-cold fixative was added dropwise, followed by an additional 10 ml of fixative. The suspension was centrifuged at 230g for 10 min at 4 °C and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of fresh fixative. The prepared cells were stored at −20 °C until ready for chromosomal spreading.

For dropping onto slides, Epredia Superfrost Plus slides were cleaned and kept in a coplin jar with methanol and kept at 4 °C until required. When ready for dropping, a cleaned slide was removed and placed tilted on an Eppendorf tube rack. Then, 100 μl of fixed cells were dropped from a ~30-cm height onto the slide and allowed to flow down the glass. Excess fixative was removed on a paper towel and the slide was allowed to dry fully for ~5 min.

Immunofluorescence on cells fixed in methanol and acetic acid was performed as described in Beh et al.89, with some modifications. The primary antibody used to identify the dicentric chromosome was a guinea pig anti-CENP-C (1:1,000, MBL, PD030) and the secondary antibody was used at 1:500 (anti-guinea pig Alexa Fluor 488, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The Metafer imaging platform (MetaSystems, Metafer4 version 3.13.5) and Isis software (version 5.8.14) were used for automated acquisition of the chromosome spreads. For mFISH following immunocytochemistry, slides were washed in PBS for 3 min as described in Beh et al.89 and mFISH was performed with a 24 XCyte probe (MetaSystems) following the manufacturer's instructions. The Metafer imaging platform (MetaSystems, Metafer4 version 3.13.5) and Isis software (version 5.8.14) were used for the second acquisition of chromosome spreads and mFISH image analysis.

New findings from the University of Birmingham suggest that regularly eating foods rich in flavanols, including tea, berries, apples, and cocoa, may help protect men's blood vessels from the negative effects that occur during long periods of sitting.

Sedentary habits are widespread in modern life. Young adults spend an estimated six hours a day seated, and extended sitting is known to reduce how well blood vessels function.

Earlier research has shown that even a small 1% drop in vascular function, measured through brachial Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), corresponds to a 13% rise in the risk of cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease, strokes, and heart attacks.

Researchers in the new study set out to determine whether specific dietary choices, particularly foods high in flavanols, could help offset the decline in vascular health that occurs during uninterrupted sitting.

What Flavanols Are and Why They Matter

Flavanols are naturally occurring polyphenols found in various fruits, tea, nuts, and cocoa beans. They have previously been linked to cardiovascular benefits, including support for the vascular system during psychological stress.

The study, which has been published in the Journal of Physiology, builds on this earlier evidence.

Dr. Catarina Rendeiro, Assistant Professor in Nutritional Sciences at the University of Birmingham and lead author, explained: "Whether we are sitting at desks, behind the wheel of a car, on a train, or on the sofa reading a book or watching TV, we all spend a lot of time seated. Even though we are not moving our bodies, we are still putting them under stress. Finding ways to mitigate the impact that sitting for uninterrupted periods has on our vascular system could help us cut the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases."

Cardiovascular disease continues to rise. According to the British Heart Foundation, deaths among working-aged adults in the UK increased by 18% to 21,975 in 2023 compared to 2019. Recent analyses also estimate that cardiovascular diseases cost the UK approximately £29 billion.

Testing Whether Flavanols Protect the Body During Sitting

To explore whether flavanols could help preserve vascular function, the researchers examined the effects of these compounds during a two-hour sitting period. Forty healthy young men took part. Twenty had higher fitness levels and twenty had lower fitness levels. Each participant consumed either a high-flavanol cocoa drink (695 mg of total flavanols per beverage) or a low-flavanol cocoa drink (5.6 mg of total flavanols per beverage) before beginning the sitting session.

Women were not included in the study because fluctuations in estrogen during the menstrual cycle may influence how flavanols affect vascular function. The researchers note that this should be explored in future trials.

Before and after the sitting period, the team measured several indicators of vascular health, including:

High-Flavanol Cocoa Prevents Declines in Blood Vessel Function

Both the higher and lower fitness groups who consumed the low-flavanol drink showed declines in FMD in the arteries of their arms and legs. These participants also experienced increases in diastolic blood pressure, reductions in shear rate and blood flow, and lower leg muscle oxygenation. The results indicate that simply being more physically fit does not protect against the vascular effects of prolonged sitting.

In contrast, participants in both fitness groups who consumed the high-flavanol cocoa did not show declines in FMD in either the arm or leg arteries. This is the first study to demonstrate that flavanols can prevent sitting-induced vascular dysfunction in healthy young men.

Dr. Sam Lucas, Professor of Cerebrovascular, Exercise & Environmental Physiology at the University of Birmingham and co-author, said: "Our experiment indicates that higher fitness levels do not prevent the temporary impairment of vascular function induced by sitting when only drinking low-flavanol cocoa. Importantly, after the high-flavanol drink, both fitter and less-fit participants kept their FMD the same as it was before sitting for two hours."

The results also show for the first time that baseline cardiorespiratory fitness does not change how the body responds to flavanol intake. This suggests that flavanols may help support vascular health regardless of someone's fitness level.

Adding Flavanol-Rich Foods to Daily Routines

Alessio Daniele, PhD student at the University of Birmingham, noted: "It is actually quite easy to add high flavanol foods to your diet. There are cocoa products available in supermarkets and health stores which are processed through methods that preserve flavanol levels. If cocoa isn't your thing, fruits like apples, plums and berries, nuts, and black and green tea are all common kitchen staples and are readily available."

Dr. Catarina Rendeiro added: "Our research shows that consuming high-flavanol foods and drinks during periods spent sitting down is a good way to reduce some of the impact of inactivity on the vascular system.

"Given how common sedentary lifestyles have become and the increased risk this can have to vascular health, using flavanol-rich food and drink, especially in combination with breaking up periods of inactivity by going for a short walk or standing up, could be a good way to enhance long-term health, no matter the individual's fitness level."

Startup Fleet Space announced yesterday that it used its satellite-powered AI system to expand the scope of an already massive lithium deposit in Quebec.

Finding a mineral resource isn't easy. Only about three in 1,000 potential deposits end up becoming commercially viable, and it can take years to prove it by drilling core samples. Fleet Space says its approach can help target drilling operations, reducing decision time from weeks to days.

The startup currently has a small constellation of satellites in orbit that use a range of sensors, including electromagnetic and gravity-sensing, to map the subsurface. Fleet Space then feeds that data into its software platform, which can provide a new location for drilling in as little as 48 hours.

The Cisco project is currently estimating that it could produce up to 329 million metric tons of lithium oxide. Fleet Space said the results of lithium deposits might extend beyond Cisco's current boundaries, saying the region has “district-scale potential.”

Speechify has largely been a tool that helps you listen to articles, PDFs, and documents. The company is now adding voice detection features to its Chrome extension, including voice typing and a voice assistant that answers your questions.

In the last 12 months, there has been a proliferation of voice detection tools, thanks to overall quality improvement in speech recognition models. Speechify is hitching its wagon to this train and launching its own dictation tool with support for English. Just like other dictation tools, Speechify's voice typing corrects errors and removes filler words.

In my short test of just more than a day, I felt there was a lot of room for improvement in Speechify's tool. For instance, the tools work fine with Gmail and Google Docs, but on sites like WordPress, I have had difficulty in triggering the voice dictation and having it work well. The company said that it is adding optimization for popular sites gradually.

In terms of accuracy, the word error rate was higher than some other tools like Wispr Flow, Willow, and Monologue. Speechify noted that its model learns faster as you use it more, and the error rate will gradually decrease.

The startup is also launching a conversational voice assistant that lives in the sidebar of your browser. You can ask it questions about the website, such as “what are the three key ideas?” or “explain this in simpler terms.”

While ChatGPT and Gemini have conversational modes, Speechify's argument is that they are treated as an afterthought in their apps, and the startup's own tool has voice as front and center. 

“We believe that chat will always be the default user experience in ChatGPT and Gemini when you open the apps. That's what their users expect. Voice will always be secondary – and in many cases, an afterthought for ChatGPT and Gemini. We know from several years of building Speechify that there's a large portion of the market, which includes our users, who want voice as the primary, default setting every time they open an app and talk to AI,” Rohan Pavuluri, the company's chief business officer, told TechCrunch over email.

One notable hiccup with this is that Speechify's assistant doesn't currently work with browsers with in-built sidebar assistants like OpenAI's Atlas, Perplexity's Comet, and Dia. The startup is not too worried about that as the extension is largely intended for Chrome and its massive user base.

Speechify said that it plans to include both voice typing and a voice assistant in all its apps across desktop and mobile gradually.

The startup also wants to develop agents that complete tasks on your behalf. The startup didn't reveal its full roadmap, but gave one example: making calls for you to make an appointment or wait on hold with customer support of a company. Other companies like Truecaller and Cloacked have been chasing similar targets.

If you're building an early-stage startup and trying to raise venture capital dollars to fuel your big ideas — focus on solving a specific problem, make sure you have strong conviction, and think hard about distribution in the age of AI.

Those were some tips shared during a recent Seattle AI Week panel discussion I moderated with Kellan Carter, founding general partner at Bellevue, Wash.-based firm Fuse, and Rohan D'Souza, CEO and co-founder at Seattle-based healthcare benefits startup Avante.

The pair know each other well. Fuse led Avante's $10 million seed round in late 2023, before the company was generating meaningful revenue.

Carter initially met D'Souza several years earlier. “There's so much trust that had been built,” Carter said, reflecting the importance of relationship-building between founders and VCs.

The title of the panel discussion, hosted by Seattle VC firm Ascend, was “The New Series A Landscape” — a nod to shifting expectations in the AI boom.

The median Series A round in Q1 of this year was $7.9 million, according to Carta. But there were also nine companies that raised more than $200 million for their Series A rounds in Q3, according to CB Insights.

“The variance for Series A is wider than ever,” Carter said.

For those companies raising massive Series A rounds, Carter said it's about “unfair insight” that creates conviction and opens doors to capital. 

“The insight is so clear it's getting investors excited to cut that big of a check — because the prize is so big right now,” Carter said.

Venture funding has increased to a 3-year high, largely thanks to AI, which accounted for 51% of all funding and 22% of deals in Q3, CB Insights reported. 

Carter joked that AI is “always in the pitch now — even if it's not AI.” For Fuse, assessing a pitch is about determining the best way to solve a customer's problem — with or without AI. 

Carter said investors lean toward founders who have domain knowledge and understand a first- or second-priority customer problem better than anyone else. “They have insight that's going to give them credibility in a customer conversation,” he said.

And in a world where AI is shifting how software is sold, Carter said he's looking for a clear distribution advantage. “Product won't win,” he said. “Distribution will win.”

He added: “We love founders that have the domain experience, that have the insight, and they can get us super excited about a distribution strategy that's a little more clever or unique in an AI world.”

When it comes to talking about AI during a pitch, the conversation will differ depending on whether you're talking to a customer or investor, according to D'Souza. 

He said customers may have “FOMO” when it comes to AI — fear of missing out — but they probably actually have “FOMU”: fear of messing up. D'Souza said it's the founder's job to help customers understand that it's about “unlocking a whole new way of productivity.”

For investors, D'Souza said it's important to show how AI improves margins — for example, by speeding up customer acquisition and onboarding. 

Avante officially launched earlier this year as it scales its software product that aims to help companies decrease HR administration workload and reduce overall benefits program costs.

As he thinks about raising a Series A round of funding, D'Souza said one advantage of bringing in fresh cash is that it acts as a signal to enterprise buyers — some who may be wary of an early stage, 20-person startup tucked away in the Pacific Northwest.

“There's a little bit of that perception of, what will happen if these guys go away?” he said. “So as a founder, I'm like, OK, should we really aggressively start to pursue more money on the balance sheet? To send a clear message out that, we've got a lot more gas in the tank, even though we didn't necessarily need it.”

As for competitors, D'Souza said founders should focus less on similar startups and more on incumbents. “What are they doing to unlock a feature set? And how do you get there much faster?” he said. 

Carter noted that Fuse stays clear of companies that might directly compete with the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, OpenAI, or Anthropic.

“If we think that there is an inkling that they're going to release a product and the next thing you know, everyone is competing against free or bundling — that's a problem,” he said.

D'Souza, a former product chief at healthcare automation company Olive AI, stressed the importance of transparency with investors. 

“Be very clear about your timelines,” he said. “If you need three months or six months to really build out the core of your product, be extremely transparent about it.”

D'Souza said Avante deliberately planned no recurring revenue for 2024, ran an early adopter program that wasn't free, then came out of stealth in April 2025 and converted pilots into multi-year deals. “We created a little bit of scarcity and FOMO around this concept of an early adopter program,” he said.

D'Souza also advised his fellow founders to “focus on the one core thing that you do 100X better.”

Editor's note: This series profiles six of the Seattle region's “Uncommon Thinkers”: inventors, scientists, technologists and entrepreneurs transforming industries and driving positive change in the world. They will be recognized Dec. 11 at the GeekWire Gala. Uncommon Thinkers is presented in partnership with Greater Seattle Partners.

BOTHELL, Wash. — Before he became the CEO of Portal Space Systems, Jeff Thornburg worked for two of the world's most innovative space-minded billionaires. Now he's working on an idea those billionaires never thought to pursue: building a spacecraft powered by the heat of focused sunlight.

Thornburg and his teammates are aiming to make Bothell-based Portal the first commercial venture to capitalize on solar thermal propulsion, a technology studied decades ago by NASA and the U.S. Air Force. The concept involves sending a propellant through a heat exchanger, where the heat gathered up from sunlight causes it to expand and produce thrust, like steam whistling out of a teakettle.

The technology is more fuel-efficient than traditional chemical propulsion — and faster-acting than solar electric propulsion, which uses solar arrays to turn sunlight into electricity to power an ion drive. Solar thermal propulsion nicely fills a niche between those two methods to move a spacecraft between orbits. But neither NASA nor the Air Force followed up on the concept.

“They didn't abandon it for technical reasons,” Thornburg said. At the time, it just didn't make economic or strategic sense to take the concept any further.

What's changed?

“Lower launch costs, coupled with additive manufacturing, are the major unlocks to bring the tech to life, and make it affordable and in line with commercial development,” Thornburg said.

Thornburg argues that it's the right time for Portal's spacecraft to fill a gap in America's national security posture on the high frontier. “There was no imperative for rapid movement on orbit in the 1990s,” he said. “Only recently have the threats from our adversaries highlighted the weaknesses in current electric propulsion systems, in that they have so little thrust and can't enable rapid mobility.”

Portal's vision has attracted interest — and financial support — from investors and potential customers. Since its founding in 2021, the startup has raised more than $20 million in venture capital. In 2024, Portal won a commitment for $45 million in public-private funding from SpaceWERX, the innovation arm of the U.S. Space Force. And next year, Portal is due to demonstrate its hardware for the first time in orbit.

So, how did Thornburg hit upon the idea of turning a decades-old idea into reality?

Thornburg, who's now 52 years old, has focused on making things fly for most of his career. It all started when he was a college student in Missouri in the early 1990s, earning his aerospace engineering degree with an ROTC scholarship from the Air Force. He recalled a conversation he had with an instructor who was an old F-4 fighter pilot.

“With my nearsightedness, I was out of the game from a pilot standpoint,” Thornburg said. “But he said, ‘Thornburg, if you can't fly the planes, go be as close to them as you can.'”

Thornburg signed up for a program that fast-tracked him into an aircraft maintenance role. He traveled around the world with KC-135 cargo planes, supporting missions that included the NATO-led air campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999. During his time as a flight commander and aircraft maintenance officer at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, “I had a couple of hundred enlisted people who worked hard to keep me out of trouble,” he said.

The Air Force is where he earned his master's degree in aerospace engineering. “My adviser had a friend that worked at the Air Force Research Lab,” Thornburg recalled. “He called him and said, ‘The Air Force is about to send this guy to do something with airplanes, but I'm pretty sure he's going to be disappointed if he can't come out and work on rocket engines.'”

Sure enough, Thornburg was soon working on rocket propulsion development, including a project to create what's known as a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine. “We made what people thought was not possible possible with that program,” Thornburg said.

In 2004, Thornburg left the Air Force to work on rocket propulsion systems at Exquadrum, Aerojet and NASA. Then, in 2011, he took a phone call from SpaceX's billionaire founder, Elon Musk. “We talked for about an hour, hour and a half on the phone — and he said, ‘I've got a project I want to talk to you about,'” Thornburg said.

That project led to the development of SpaceX's methane-fueled Raptor rocket engine, which leveraged the technology that Thornburg helped pioneer at the Air Force. “That was a wild ride, because that felt like about 15 or 20 years of experience in a five-year time period,” he recalled.

After five years at SpaceX, Thornburg needed to wind down. He decided to do some consulting at his home base in Huntsville, Alabama, also known as Rocket City. “About six months in, I'm like, I need a real job again,” he said. “And some friends of mine introduced me to, ultimately, Paul Allen. Paul called me and said, ‘Can you come out to my Seattle office?'”

The Microsoft co-founder and software billionaire enlisted Thornburg to become the head of rocket propulsion development for Stratolaunch, Allen's space venture. Thornburg led the effort to create a liquid rocket engine known as the PGA — which stood for “Paul G. Allen.”

Unfortunately, Allen passed away in 2018, just one month after the engine was unveiled. Under new ownership, Stratolaunch pivoted to hypersonic testing, and the PGA project fell by the wayside. Once again, Thornburg and his family hunkered down in Huntsville.

“I decided to start my first space company after Paul died,” Thornburg said. “I focused on hydrogen propulsion technology and solutions, kind of like what we were working on for Paul.”

That first company, Interstellar Technologies, started working on projects for NASA, Northrop Grumman and a couple of other customers. Then the pandemic hit. “The investors that were about to provide funding disappeared,” Thornburg said. “NASA went home, Northrop Grumman went home. And so I had to find my small team other jobs.”

Just as Thornburg was about to resign himself to riding out the pandemic in Alabama, Amazon's recruiters called. They asked him to move to Seattle to run engineering and manufacturing for Project Kuiper, the satellite internet project that's now known as Amazon Leo. “That's ultimately what got us moved to Seattle,” Thornburg said.

His yearlong stint at Amazon was long enough to establish the process for building Project Kuiper's two prototypes and the production-grade satellites that came after them. Then he took on engineering management roles at Agility Robotics and Commonwealth Fusion Systems.

That's when Portal Space Systems took shape.

To be fair, the seeds for Portal were planted back in 2016, just weeks after Thornburg left SpaceX. “Lawrence Livermore Lab had called and said, ‘We're doing a seminar on the future of propulsion. Would you like to come be a speaker?'” he recalled. “I said, ‘Yes, what do you want me to talk about?' They said, ‘We want you to tell us what the future of propulsion looks like.' Oh my gosh, no pressure on that!”

As he did the research for his talk, he came across the idea of putting a nuclear reactor on a spacecraft, and using the concentrated heat from that reactor to blast a propellant through a thruster. The concept, known as nuclear thermal propulsion, seemed like a stretch — but then Thornburg had an uncommon thought.

“Can you concentrate solar energy to heat a thrust chamber and do the same thing?” Thornburg said. “You can. It's not quite as effective as a nuclear reactor, for obvious reasons, but it's all the same pieces. … Now I don't have to wait on a low-cost, low-weight, space-rated nuclear reactor that doesn't exist yet.”

Thornburg mulled over the idea for years. “I was thinking about Portal, and I was starting the beginnings of Portal in 2021, but I still had to pay the bills,” he said. For a couple of years, he worked during the day at Agility Robotics and Commonwealth Fusion — and spent nights and weekends laying the groundwork for the startup.

“When Portal could really start to stand on its own, as we started to win over the Defense Department, that's when I made the switch with all of my time focused on what was going on in Portal,” Thornburg said. In April 2024, the startup emerged from stealth and announced it had received more than $3 million in funding from the Defense Department and the Space Force.

Portal's flagship vehicle is called Supernova. It's a rapid-transorbital, multi-mission vehicle that should be capable of moving itself and its payloads from one orbit to another — even from low Earth orbit to geostationary Earth orbit, more than 20,000 miles higher up. And it should be able to do that within hours or a day, rather than the weeks or months that are typically required.

The spacecraft itself will be about the size of a restaurant refrigerator. To concentrate sunlight on its heat exchanger and thruster system, Supernova will use sheets of reflective material that can unfold to a width of roughly 55 feet. Ammonia will serve as the propellant. The 3D-printed heat exchanger thruster, dubbed Flare, was successfully tested earlier this year.

Next year's orbital demonstration will involve putting an instrument package known as Mini-Nova, which is about the size of a tissue box, on a satellite platform that's due for launch on a SpaceX rideshare mission. The demonstration is meant to validate Supernova's system design.

In late 2026, Portal plans to send up a free-flying spacecraft called Starburst, which will be equipped with thrusters powered by an electrothermal heating system. Starburst won't be as powerful as Supernova, but it will provide Portal's customers with an early option for rapid maneuverability in orbit. If next year's test goes well, Starburst is expected to start taking on customer missions in 2027.

2027 is also the year when Supernova is scheduled to make its debut. All of the development work for Supernova and Starburst will be taking place at Portal's 8,000-square-foot lab and 50,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Bothell.

Throughout Portal's formative years, Thornburg has worked with fellow members of the “small team” he assembled at Interstellar Technologies. Both of Portal's other co-founders — chief operating officer Ian Vorbach and engineering vice president Prashaanth Ravindran — crossed paths with Thornburg at Interstellar, and at Stratolaunch before that.

Vorbach, whose background includes startup experience as well as engineering experience, said Portal's business model has been fine-tuned to make sure it addresses the needs of its target market. He and Thornburg identified the U.S. military's need for tactical responsiveness in space as the top priority.

“What happens a lot in the space industry is that you have incredibly technical, talented people who have a technology that provides some very unique performance, and then they build it, and it turns out that performance isn't needed,” Vorbach said. “There's got to be a reason to bring that innovation to market.”

Vorbach is grateful for Thornburg's leadership. “We work very long hours, but I think Jeff does a great job of making sure people know that they're valued,” he said. “I appreciate that, and I think it's why we, fortunately, are able to hire great talent from the places he's come from, whether it's SpaceX or Kuiper.”

Ravindran, who worked at Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space venture before taking a founder's role at Portal, agreed with that assessment. “It's always amazing to have someone like Jeff out there, because he's come up the engineering road to realize our pain points as well, and he doesn't try to hold us to unfair standards,” he said. “That way, we are not set up for failure.”

Stan Shull, a space industry analyst at Bellevue, Wash.-based Alliance Velocity, gives Portal high marks. “In space terms, a highly maneuverable satellite is said to have high delta-V,” he told GeekWire in an email. “Portal, as a company, feels high delta-V too.”

Thornburg's experience and expertise are big factors behind Portal's rapid progress, Shull said. “He's very knowledgeable about national security issues and is a straight shooter about the growing threat environment in orbit,” he said. “It's no surprise the Space Force is among the many customers interested in what the company is up to.”

What will Portal be up to next? Looking long-term, Thornburg is intrigued by the quantum frontier. “I think there are some very interesting things happening in our understanding of quantum physics that will have propulsion applications, that won't look like propulsion as we know it right now,” he said. “If we could fold spacetime in clever ways … there's been plenty of writing about that.”

But when he takes a more realistic look at what could happen in his lifetime, Thornburg can't stop thinking about nuclear propulsion. “Our Supernova spacecraft will have a version that will leverage a nuclear reactor at some point. That was always the going-in position,” he said.

The way Thornburg sees it, the nuclear option will revolutionize spacecraft — and expand humanity's reach on the final frontier while we figure out how to fold spacetime.

“Nuclear thermal will get us further into the solar system, and this Earth-moon-Mars becomes our backyard,” he said. “But, you know, for my 12-year-old version of myself, that's not enough.”

Tim Allen has finished recording for Toy Story 5. James Gunn teases the latest progress on Man of Tomorrow. Plus, It: Welcome to Derry celebrates Pennywise's arrival with new footage. Spoilers away!



Deadline reports Alexandra Shipp, Eric Stoltz, and David Howard Thornton will star in The Autopsy of Albert Kemper, a “psychological horror film” from writer-director David Benullo. The story concerns Riley Shaw (Shipp), “a morgue assistant who faces a terrifying night when the body of a notorious serial killer begins to show signs of something beyond death.” Thornton will play the film's titular villain, Albert Kemper.

Speaking with Entertainment Weekly, Sadie Sink addressed rumors she's playing Jean Grey, among other potential comic book characters, in Spider-Man: Brand New Day. 

That was happening before I even knew that I would be working on this project. I was like, ‘Wait! What are people talking about?' A lot of people forget that hair color can change, but, yeah, I understand all of the theories. People will just have to wait and see. I'm excited for all of it to maybe be put to rest.

Tim Allen revealed he finished recording his lines as Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story 5 in a recent Twitter post.

I did wrap my part in Toy Story 5 Friday. Really affected me. I love these creators and love this story and blessed to be in this wonderful space suit for so many years.

According to a new report from World of Reel, special effects designer Adam Wright has built a “6×6 m mechanical anthropomorphic puppet” of Polyphemus the cyclops inside of a cave wall for Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey.

James Gunn revealed a stack of storyboards he's drawn up for Man of Tomorrow in a recent Instagram post.

                                What happens here matters everywhere

Sam Ransbotham teaches a class in machine learning as a professor of business analytics at Boston College, and what he's witnessing in the classroom both excites and terrifies him.

Some students are using AI tools to create and accomplish amazing things, learning and getting more out of the technology than he could have imagined. But in other situations, he sees a concerning trend: students “phoning things into the machine.”

The result is a new kind of digital divide — but it's not the one you'd expect.

Boston College provides premier tools to students at no cost, to ensure that socioeconomics aren't the differentiator in the classroom. But Ransbotham, who hosts the “Me, Myself and AI” podcast from MIT Sloan Management Review, worries about “a divide in technology interest.”

“The deeper that someone is able to understand tools and technology, the more that they're able to get out of those tools,” he explained. “A cursory usage of a tool will get a cursory result, and a deeper use will get a deeper result.”

The problem? “It's a race to mediocre. If mediocre is what you're shooting for, then it's really quick to get to mediocre.”

He explained, “Boston College's motto is ‘Ever to Excel.' It's not ‘Ever to Mediocre.' And the ability of students to get to excellence can be hampered by their ease of getting to mediocre.”

That's one of the topics on this special episode of the GeekWire Podcast, a collaboration with Me, Myself and AI. Sam and I compare notes from our podcasts and share our own observations on emerging trends and long-term implications of AI. This is a two-part series across our podcasts — you can find the rest of our conversation on the Me, Myself and AI feed.

Continue reading for takeaways from this episode.

AI has a measurement problem: Sam, who researched Wikipedia extensively more than a decade ago, sees parallels to the present day. Before Wikipedia, Encyclopedia Britannica was a company with employees that produced books, paid a printer, and created measurable economic value. Then Wikipedia came along, and Encyclopedia Britannica didn't last.

Its economic value was lost. But as he puts it: “Would any rational person say that the world is a worse place because we now have Wikipedia versus Encyclopedia Britannica?”

In other words, traditional economic metrics don't fully capture the net gain in value that Wikipedia created for society. He sees the same measurement problem with AI. 

“The data gives better insights about what you're doing, about the documents you have, and you can make a slightly better decision,” he said. “How do you measure that?”

Content summarization vs. generation: Sam's “gotta have it” AI feature isn't about creating content — it's about distilling information to fit more into his 24 hours.

“We talk a lot about generation and the generational capabilities, what these things can create,” he said. “I find myself using it far more for what it can summarize, what it can distill.”

Finding value in AI, even when it's wrong: Despite his concerns about students using AI to achieve mediocrity, Sam remains optimistic about what people can accomplish with AI tools.

“Often I find that the tool is completely wrong and ridiculous and it says just absolute garbage,” he said. “But that garbage sparks me to think about something — the way that it's wrong pushes me to think: why is that wrong? … and how can I push on that?”

Searching for the signal in the noise: Sam described the goal of the Me, Myself and AI podcast as cutting through the polarizing narratives about artificial intelligence.

“There's a lot of hype about artificial intelligence,” he said. “There's a lot of naysaying about artificial intelligence. And somewhere between those, there is some signal, and some truth.”

Last month, Kentucky attorney general Russell Coleman announced the details of yet another lawsuit against Roblox over suspected pedophiles lurking on the hugely popular gaming platform.

While doing so, Coleman singled out the work of one self-described “predator hunter” who claims to have helped identify alleged abusers mixing with young gamers.

“Roblox is even trying to silence those who raised these security risks,” Coleman said. “The famous case of one of their developers, Schlep, immediately comes to mind.”

Schlep is in fact Michael, a 22-year-old Texan who has spent the last two years working with a group of other Roblox players to track down and identify people purportedly seeking to groom young children on the platform—predators like the one Schlep says allegedly groomed him a decade ago, which he says led him to try to take his own life.

In the process of attempting to out suspected groomers, Schlep—who doesn't share his surname for privacy reasons—has amassed 2.3 million subscribers on his YouTube channel, where he highlights what he believes to be the shortcomings of Roblox's safety features and reveals the identities of the alleged predators he has tracked down.

But on August 8, Schlep received a cease-and-desist letter from Roblox, and instantly, all of his accounts were banned. His predator hunter days were over.

“While Roblox acknowledges that your stated intentions may be to protect children, and while it recognizes the serious nature of online predatory behavior, your methods, including failing to immediately report suspicious activity to Roblox through proper channels, are actively interfering with Roblox's established safety protocols and, critically, are exposing Roblox's users to increased risk,” the company wrote in the letter reviewed by WIRED.

Roblox's cease-and-desist against Schlep comes amid mounting pressure against the company. Over the past four months, several states have launched high-profile legal actions alleging that the gaming platform has become a hunting ground for pedophiles preying on its youngest and most vulnerable users.

In August, Louisiana's attorney general filed a lawsuit alleging Roblox “knowingly enabled and facilitated the systemic sexual exploitation and abuse of children.” In October, Florida attorney general James Uthmeier issued criminal subpoenas to the company to assess whether it is “aiding predators in accessing and harming children.” And earlier this month, Texas attorney general Ken Paxton sued Roblox, alleging it is “putting pixel pedophiles and profits over the safety of Texas children.”

On November 18, activist groups UltraViolet and ParentsTogether Action held a virtual protest inside Roblox to deliver a petition calling on company CEO David Baszucki to “put child safety before engagement metrics.”

Roblox announced a new AI-powered age verification system in September and is now expanding it to include chat. The company did not respond to a request for comment about the growing number of lawsuits it's facing.

Schlep claims his work reporting individuals directly to law enforcement and collaborating with vigilante groups like Pedophile Poachers and EDP Watch has led to the arrests of six men that he alleged were trying to sexually exploit young children. Once they have identified someone they believe to be a pedophile, these vigilante groups typically lure their targets into real world meetings by pretending to be an underage boy or girl. At the meeting, the groups will film their encounters with their targets, before uploading the footage to their social media channels.

“The only way this can really be viewed in my eyes is Roblox is trying to silence a critic who has exposed the insane flaw in their platform: that there are sexual predators everywhere,” Schlep says. “I think Roblox wants to make an example of me.”

Despite these pedophile hunting groups' stated intentions of protecting children, extremism researchers and law enforcement officials have criticized their methods for being focused on gaining more followers rather than securing prosecutions. Some have also faced their own criminal charges; The New York Times reported in March that pedophile hunters were behind over 170 violent vigilante attacks since 2023.

"Taking the law into your hands isn't safe in the real world, and it's not safe online,” a spokesperson for Roblox said. “That's why we work with law enforcement to hold bad actors accountable.”

But Schlep sees the decision as yet another sign of just how disconnected he believes the company is from the wider community.

In light of his ban, a massive #FreeSchlep movement has sprung up online, with supporters posting on social media as well as holding virtual protests on Roblox. Some of the biggest Roblox influencers, including Kindly Keyin and ThinkNoodles—who have 5.8 million and 12.2 million subscribers on YouTube, respectively—have publicly left the company's partner program this fall in solidarity with Schlep.

Schlep says he began playing games on the platform when he was 7. Five years later, he says, he was groomed on Roblox by a man, and that the abuse was so bad that he says he attempted suicide.

While Schlep was recovering in a hospital, he claims his mother contacted Roblox about the situation, but he says she was “brushed off.” Roblox did not respond to multiple requests for comment about this incident.

In 2023, Schlep decided to take things into his own hands and began posting to his YouTube channel about the alleged grooming and sexual exploitation on the platform.

“It was mind-blowing,” Schlep says. “There were communities of people trading child pornography for Roblox's in-game currency, Robux. They put up on group walls where anybody could view, ‘I will pay five Robux for cheese pizza,' which stands for child pornography.” He says these groups were accessible to kids. The idea that cheese pizza was code for “child pornography” originates in the Pizzagate conspiracy theory from 2016. In leaked emails, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta referenced pizza, which users of fringe online message boards like 4chan falsely claimed was code for child sexual abuse material.

Much of the work of tracking down Roblox predators began on Discord, where Schlep and a team of what he says is up to six amateur investigators would seek out servers dedicated to so-called “condo games” on Roblox. While Roblox defines these sorts of games as “social hangout experiences depicting private spaces,” Schlep alleges they are often overtly sexual spaces.

So-called condo games “refers to sex communities on Roblox, and these Discord communities would be dedicated to bypassing the rules of Roblox,” Schlep says. “People would upload these graphic sex games with animations and everything. When Roblox would take it down, people on Discord would create a brand new link, and people would join the new link. It would just be like a game of whack-a-mole for Roblox.”

In mid August, around the filing of the lawsuit by the Louisiana attorney general, Roblox updated its terms of use to restrict these games to users who are ID-verified to be 17 years old or older.

Schlep began interacting with what he alleges are potential predators not on Roblox but on Discord, where a quick search, he claims, would allow him to find servers dedicated to people looking for partners with whom to play condo games. Discord did not respond to WIRED's request for comment, but it appears it may have recently made it more difficult for users to find these condo servers, and WIRED was unable to easily locate them on the platform.

“I would just send a simple message, like, ‘Hi' and my DMs would just be flooded,” Schlep alleges. “And a lot of them were predators.” He says these people would begin sexually explicit conversations, saying “some of the most disgusting things.”

Schlep and his colleagues would then ask the person they were communicating with where they lived. When the person asked the same question, Schlep would respond by giving a location relatively close to the predator's home.

Schlep claims he would then work with pedophile hunter groups like Predator Poachers to conduct a sting operation where he says they lure the alleged predator into confessing on camera, something that can happen both before and after the police show up.

Of the six alleged predators arrested following stings by Schlep and his team, none have so far been convicted, Schlep says, and at least one of them has not proceeded to prosecution, while two others are heading for plea deals.

Schlep's lawyer, Martin Gould, tells WIRED that Schlep turned to working with pedophile hunting groups because there was no other option.

“A lot of these people are doing what they're doing because there's a void, because no one else is addressing the problem,” Gould says.

In a blog post explaining the new rules, Matt Kaufman, Roblox's chief safety officer, wrote that “on multiple occasions” the company had observed vigilante groups refraining from reporting issues to Roblox until after they had posted about it on social media in order to boost their own followings.

Schlep denies Roblox's allegations that he did anything wrong.

“They're saying that I'm impersonating children,” Schlep says. “That's just a total lie. Impersonation means I'm taking the identity of a real kid. We've never used any photos of real kids, or taken the identity of a real kid. We create new identities, and everyone is above the age of 18, but we just pretend that we're a minor.” He also says he's the only person to have his accounts banned by Roblox; his team members have not been punished. The company did not respond to a request for comment on what it meant by “impersonating children” and whether it had banned other accounts since implementing its new rules.

The controversy around Schlep comes as law firms across the country are prepping hundreds of lawsuits on behalf of parents of young children who all allege they were groomed or exploited, and in some cases even kidnapped and sexually assaulted.

While Schlep can no longer access Roblox, he is still working to highlight the issues on the platform. His YouTube channel has grown its following significantly since the ban, and he is now collaborating with Chris Hansen, the journalist who previously hosted the To Catch a Predator segment on Dateline NBC and is currently working on an investigation into alleged predators on Roblox.

Ultimately Schlep believes the solution is simple.

“It shouldn't be so open and accessible, that's the main issue here,” Schlep alleges of Roblox's platform. “The fact that you can just search up a term on Roblox and you're able to join a sex game, that's just ridiculous. If Disney or Lego or any other of these children's companies were held to the same standards, they would be getting crucified in the media. It's so insane to see how much leeway Roblox has been given, and so many children are becoming victimized in the process.”

The platform promises to pool GPUs and NPUs and raise average utilization by about 30%.

Huawei has introduced Flex:ai, an open-source orchestration tool designed to raise the utilization rate of AI chips in large-scale compute clusters. Announced on Friday, November 21, the platform builds on Kubernetes and will be released through Huawei's ModelEngine developer community. It arrives amid continued U.S.export restrictions on high-end GPU hardware and reflects a growing shift inside China toward software-side efficiency gains as a stopgap for constrained silicon supply.

Aside from being equipped to help China “...create an analogue AI chip 1000 times faster than Nvidia's chips,” Huawei claims Flex:ai can raise average utilization by around 30%. It reportedly does this by slicing individual GPU or NPU cards into multiple virtual compute instances and orchestrating workloads across heterogeneous hardware types.

Smaller tasks that might otherwise underuse a full accelerator are stacked alongside one another, while larger models that exceed the capacity of a single device can span multiple cards. The tool includes a smart scheduler, dubbed Hi Scheduler, that redistributes idle resources across nodes in real time, automatically reassigning compute to wherever AI workloads are queued.

Flex:ai's architecture builds on existing open-source Kubernetes foundations but extends them in ways that are still uncommon across open deployments. Kubernetes already supports device plugins to expose accelerators and schedulers, such as Volcano, or frameworks like Ray can perform fractional allocation and gang scheduling. Flex:ai appears to unify them at a higher layer while integrating support for Ascend NPUs alongside standard GPU hardware.

The launch resembles functionality offered by Run:ai, an orchestration platform acquired by Nvidia in 2024, which enables multi-tenant scheduling and workload pre-emption across large GPU clusters. Huawei's version, at least on paper, makes similar claims but does so with a focus on open-source deployment and cross-accelerator compatibility. That may give it broader relevance in clusters built around Chinese silicon, particularly those using Ascend chips.

The open-source code has not yet been released, and Huawei has not published documentation or benchmarks. When it does become available, key questions will include the granularity of slicing, how Flex:ai interacts with standard Kubernetes schedulers, and, crucially, whether it supports widely used GPU types via standard plugins. The company has said that researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong, Xi'an Jiaotong, and Xiamen University contributed to the tool's development.

Hopefully the goal isn't as far away as Tesla's Full Self Driving.

Elon Musk isn't one to shy away from grand promises, and the latest one involves AI chips. The entrepreneur has reminded people (and investors) via an X post that Tesla has had an "advanced AI chip and board engineering team" for several years now. He goes on to state that the chips coming out of this project will make Tesla "the leader in real-world AI," as bold a claim as any, and that the firm plans to make more AI chips than all other chipmakers, combined.

Musk claims this engineering team has already deployed millions of "AI chips" in cars and data centers. The keyword here is "cars," however. The actual count of deployed hardware would be hard to pin down, as the statement implies that 2016-vintage Nvidia Drive PX 2 SoCs inside early Teslas count as much as a latest-gen Blackwell data center accelerator.

The technologist goes on to specify that Tesla currently uses its own AI4 chips in its cars and is close to taping out AI5. Going a step further, he states it expects Tesla to have a new iteration ready every 12 months, but more importantly, that it expects to "build chips at higher volumes ultimately than all other AI chips combined," a statement that merits some healthy skepticism, given how many chips Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, et al currently produce.

Most people don't know that Tesla has had an advanced AI chip and board engineering team for many years.That team has already designed and deployed several million AI chips in our cars and data centers. These chips are what enable Tesla to be the leader in real-world AI.The…November 23, 2025

Tesla is currently a customer of TSMC and Samsung, and has expressed interest in working with Intel's foundries, given the current situation with worldwide chip supply constraints. Musk is considering building his own TeraFab chip factory, too. The design schedule also seems quite aggressive, but not impossible, given how much money has been poured into neural network accelerator chip design lately.

As befits a grand presentation, Musk goes on to connect the company's AI developments to the Optimus robotics project, claiming the new chips will "save millions of lives" thanks to advanced medical care via unspecified integration with Tesla's Optimus project. Optimus robots were demonstrated in 2022, but they were being teleoperated, as the company has yet to produce an actual autonomous bipedal humanoid.

The predictions about Optimus' abilities can be arguably quite optimistic, as well (pun unintended). In 2024, Musk stated the Optimus robots would be working in Tesla factories this year, and as of this writing, no public demonstrations have been made about these capabilities. In fact, just last summer, it seemed that Optimus robot production came to a grinding halt.

Having said that, it's worth keeping in mind that Elon Musk also owns xAI, a company with actual released and working products, namely the Grok chatbot, the Aurora image generator, and DeepSearch engines. It should be a safe enough assumption that Tesla and xAI are sharing technology, perhaps somewhat enabling Musk's ideals of assistant doctor robots. It's a safe bet that such a feat will take a while, as Tesla's Full Self Driving is now marking its ninth year since it was promised, and fifth since it entered the Beta stage.

Photos appearing to show Elon Musk and several other Big Tech CEOs have gone viral in the past week on X and Bluesky. The mundane environments, including humble apartments and McDonald's parking lots, should have given everyone a hint that they're fake. But there's a new way for the average person to check for themselves whether the images were made with AI. And it's actually really useful.

Right off the bat, it should be said that the vast majority of AI image detectors are not reliable. Many people think you can use tools that are openly available on the web and figure out if a given image is AI. But they're not good. For example, people often ask Grok on X whether a photo was created with generative artificial intelligence. And it frequently gets the answer wrong. Sometimes in amusing ways.

Google developed an AI watermark called SynthID a couple of years ago, but the company didn't allow the average user to check whether an image had the watermark. That changed just a few days ago. Now anyone can upload an image to Gemini and ask if it has the SynthID watermark, which is invisible to the naked eye.

The watermark is embedded in the pixels and every image created with Google's AI creation tools will have it. Checking for the watermark is now easy for anyone who opens up Gemini.

From Google's announcement:

If you see an image and want to confirm it has been made by Google AI, upload it to the Gemini app and ask a question such as: “Was this created with Google AI?” or “Is this AI-generated?”

Gemini will check for the SynthID watermark and use its own reasoning to return a response that gives you more context about the content you encounter online.

Obviously Gemini is less equipped to tell you if an image is AI if it wasn't made with Google tools like Nano Banana Pro. And that's the entire reason the company appears to be launching SynthID detection in Gemini in this moment. Nano Banana Pro launched last week and it's allowing users to make incredibly realistic images, including images of Elon Musk and other tech CEOs that look very real.

Some of those images have recently gone viral, like one that racked up nearly 9 million views on X before migrating to other platforms like Bluesky. The image shows Musk, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg all standing together in a small apartment.

Other versions of the image include OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, with the men standing around in a parking lot, pictured at the top of this article. For some reason, Musk is seen smoking a cigar in a couple of them. Another image showed the men in the parking lot from a different angle. And still another had the men eating McDonald's on the ground with a Cybertruck in the background.

There are a lot of different versions circulating. They're all AI generated.

If you run any of these images through Gemini it confirms they all have the SynthID watermark. If you're wondering whether an image appears too weird to be true, it's probably a good idea to check with Gemini.

Did you see that viral image of President Donald Trump with Bill “Bubba” Clinton in a very compromising position? Running that image through Gemini confirms it was made with Google's AI image generator. Gemini won't necessarily be able to ID every AI image with certainty. But if you run an image through Gemini and it tells you the “photo” has the SynthID watermark, you know it's not real.

Fake images are still going to be everywhere in the current social media environment. But at least Google has given the average user a new tool to identify at least some of the fakes for themselves. It's only going to get harder and harder to recognize AI-generated content as the years progress. Sometimes you just need to apply some common sense. For example, do you think Elon Musk and Sam Altman would be hanging out in a parking lot together? Given their very public conflicts, that seems very unlikely.

Then again, it seemed very unlikely that Musk and President Trump would become friendly again after the Tesla CEO accused Trump of being in the Epstein files. Weirder things have happened when billions of dollars are at stake.

The data center industry is booming, as cloud providers seek to scale up their services to keep pace with demand driven by AI. In Texas, the boom is particularly bountiful. Outside of Virginia, there is no other place in the U.S. with a higher concentration of server farms than the Lone Star state (it has over 400 data centers, currently). Now, a new report claims that all these data centers may be driving up the risk of winter blackouts which, under the right circumstances, could prove life-threatening.

NBC News originally reported on a new report put out this week by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), a non-profit based in Georgia that monitors risks to the U.S. electrical grid. In its annual report, NERC discussed how the growth of the data center industry is putting additional pressure on the grid.

NERC's report notes that strong “load growth from new data centers and other large industrial end users is driving higher winter electricity demand forecasts and contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.” Electricity demand is obviously higher during colder times of year, as the estimated 42 percent of Americans who rely on electricity for heating crank up the dial when the temperature outside drops. However, the increased reliance on electricity ironically drives up the potential for grids to exceed load capacity and experience outages. Data centers put more pressure on a system that is already under strain, the report notes, writing: 

For the upcoming winter season, Texas RE-ERCOT is expected to continue facing reserve shortage risks during the peak load hour and high-net-load hours, particularly under extreme load conditions that accompany freezing temperatures. Elevated forced outage of thermal resources and reduced output from intermittent resources during these conditions exacerbates the risk of supply shortfalls.

In addition to the hundreds of data centers that already exist in Texas, the state also has projects in development—although skeptics say it won't be feasible for all of those projects to actually get built. NBC writes that there has been a huge increase in projects requesting connection to the Texas grid over the past year:

If all of those projects were actually built, they would be equivalent to the average annual power consumption of nearly 154 million homes in Texas, according to a CNBC analysis based on 2024 household electricity data. But the Lone Star state only has a population of about 30 million people. Beth Garza, a former head of ERCOT's watchdog, said she is very skeptical these projects will all get built, describing the scale of the numbers as “crazy big.” More than half the projects have not submitted planning studies, according to ERCOT.

As the AI revolution continues, unforeseen side-effects will continue to pop up. I suppose disruptions to the electrical grid are just one more price we may all have to pay so that humanity can have chatbots that can rap.

India has granted legal status to millions of gig and platform workers under its newly implemented labor laws, marking a milestone for the country's delivery, ride-hailing, and e-commerce workforce — yet with benefits still unclear and platforms beginning to assess their obligations, access to social security remains out of reach.

The recognition stems from the Code on Social Security — one of four labor laws the Indian government brought into effect on Friday, more than five years after the parliament first passed them in 2020. It is the only part of the new framework that addresses gig and platform workers, as the remaining three codes — covering wages, industrial relations, and workplace safety — do not extend minimum earnings, employment protections, or working-condition guarantees to this rapidly expanding workforce.

India has one of the world's largest and fastest-growing gig economies, with industry estimates suggesting that more than 12 million people deliver food, drive ride-hailing cabs, sort e-commerce packages, and perform other on-demand services for digital platforms. The sector has become a critical source of employment, especially for young and migrant workers shut out of formal job markets, and is projected to expand further as companies scale logistics, retail, and hyperlocal delivery.  

Companies, from Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart to Indian quick-delivery apps such as Swiggy, Eternal's Blinkit, and Zepto, as well as ride-hailing firms including Uber, Ola, and Rapido, rely on gig workers to run their businesses in the South Asian nation — the world's second-largest internet and smartphone market after China. Yet despite powering some of India's most valuable tech businesses, most gig workers operate outside traditional labor protections and lack access to basic social security.

The newly implemented labor laws are intended to change that, by defining gig and platform workers in statute and requiring aggregators, such as food-delivery and ride-hailing platforms, to contribute 1-2% of their annual revenue (capped at 5% of payments made to such workers) to a government-managed social security fund. But the details remain murky: What exact benefits will actually be offered, how workers will access them, and how contributions will be tracked across multiple platforms, and when payouts will begin all remain unclear, raising concerns that meaningful protections may take years to materialize.

The Code on Social Security creates a legal framework for gig workers to be covered under schemes such as the Employees' State Insurance, provident fund, and government-backed insurance. However, the extent of these benefits — including eligibility, contribution levels, and delivery mechanisms — remains unclear and will depend on future rules and scheme notifications.

A key part of the framework is the creation of Social Security Boards at both the central and state levels, tasked with designing and overseeing welfare schemes for gig and platform workers. The central board must include five representatives of gig and platform workers and five representatives of aggregators, all nominated by the government, alongside senior officials, experts, and state representatives, per the Code. But there is little clarity on how decisions will be made, how much influence worker representatives will actually have, or who will ultimately control decisions on funding and benefit delivery.

“We need to wait and see what exactly is in the government's mind when it comes to implementing the four Codes, and what it hopes to do for gig workers,” said Balaji Parthasarathy, a professor at IIIT Bangalore and principal investigator of the Fairwork India project. “And then we also have to see what the states translate on the ground.”

Parthasarathy noted that because labor policy in India is shared between the federal and state governments — listed  in the “concurrent list” of the Indian Constitution — state governments are responsible for designing, notifying, and administering many of the schemes needed to make the Code on Social Security operational for gig workers.

That raises the possibility of uneven access, as some states move quickly to establish social security boards and roll out mechanisms, while others delay or deprioritize the effort due to political or fiscal constraints. Recent examples — such as Rajasthan's stalled legislation after it was passed in 2023, and Karnataka's Gig Workers Act, which was implemented soon after clearing the state assembly — underscore how workers' protections may ultimately depend on where they live rather than the law itself.

Platform companies have publicly welcomed the reform, but are still largely evaluating what it will require of them. An Amazon India spokesperson told TechCrunch the company supports the Indian government's intent behind the labor overhaul and is evaluating the changes it will need to introduce. A spokesperson for Zepto said the company welcomes the new labor codes as “a big step toward clearer, simpler rules that protect workers while supporting ease of doing business,” adding that the changes will help strengthen social security for its delivery partners without undermining the flexibility that quick-commerce operations rely on.

Food delivery firm Eternal, formerly known as Zomato, said in a stock exchange filing that the Social Security Code is a step toward more uniform rules and that it does not expect the financial impact to threaten its long-term business.

Nonetheless, Aprajita Rana, a partner at corporate law firm AZB & Partners, said the change “will naturally have a financial impact” on India's e-commerce sector, as worker contributions are now being formalized. It will also create new compliance obligations, requiring companies to ensure all workers in their networks are registered with the government-managed fund, determine whether individuals are associated with multiple aggregators and how to avoid duplicative benefits, and set up internal grievance mechanisms.

“While the law has the right intent, gig worker structures in India are quite novel, and practical challenges in compliance will emerge as the law takes force,” Rana told TechCrunch.

One of the biggest hurdles for gig workers seeking benefits under the newly implemented law will be registering on the Indian government's E-Shram portal, launched in 2021 as a national database of unorganized workers. The portal had registered more than 300,000 platform workers as of the end of August, even though the government estimates India's gig workforce at around 10 million. Trade unions, including the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers (IFAT), which has more than 70,000 members, are working to help gig workers enroll so they can access the benefits.

Ambika Tandon, a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge and an affiliate of the national trade union Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said registering on the portal could mean lost wages for gig workers, since they would have to take time off to fill in required details.

“These workers work for 16 hours a day,” she told TechCrunch. “They don't have time to go and register themselves on the government portal.”

CITU is also among the 10 major Indian trade unions calling for the withdrawal of the new labor laws, ahead of nationwide protests planned for Wednesday.

The benefits of registering on the E-Shram portal are not compelling for many gig workers, Tandon noted, because the law does not address more immediate concerns such as fluctuating earnings, account suspensions, and sudden termination of accounts — issues that workers say matter far more right now than access to insurance or provident fund benefits.

Trade unions often organize strikes to push platforms to address these concerns directly. However, such actions can disrupt everyone involved, including consumers, and put workers at further risk, as they are not paid while striking and may even face termination for participating.

“While the social security rules have now been put in place, we demand a minimum wage and an employer-employee relationship for gig and platform workers, which are yet to be set by the government,” said Shaik Salauddin, founder president of the Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union (TGPWU), which has more than 10,000 members in the southern state of Telangana, and national general secretary of IFAT. “We urge the government to obtain data from aggregators and secure their monetary contributions to the fund to start offering benefits to workers.”

There is a broader debate over whether gig workers should be treated as employees — a question the new labor laws do not address. The Social Security Code defines gig and platform workers as a separate category, rather than extending them the rights and protections that come with employee status. In contrast, courts and regulators in markets such as the U.K., Spain, and New Zealand have moved toward recognizing platform workers as employees or “workers,” entitled to minimum wages, paid leave, and other benefits. In some U.S. jurisdictions, regulators and courts have pushed for platform workers to be treated as employees or similarly protected workers, though many ride-hail and delivery drivers remain classified as independent contractors.

“With this law, the Indian government has settled this debate by saying that these gig workers do not sit within the ambit of employment or other protections,” Tandon said.

The Indian labor ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

The title of the executive order is on the short side for Trump: “Launching the Genesis Mission.”

It reads in part:

In this pivotal moment, the challenges we face require a historic national effort, comparable in urgency and ambition to the Manhattan Project that was instrumental to our victory in World War II and was a critical basis for the foundation of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its national laboratories.

According to Michael Kratsios, the science advisor to the president, that Manhattan Project comparison is just the beginning. The Genesis Mission is also, we're being told, “the largest marshaling of federal scientific resources since the Apollo program.”

Then again, the Trump administration says stuff. The president said nuclear weapons tests were going to begin “immediately,” and that was almost a month ago.

But consulting AI.gov, Trump's special fan page for showing off his love of AI, I find that the president has nine marquee AI executive orders, stretching back to his previous administration, and they have titles like “Promoting the Export of the American AI Technology Stack,” and “Preventing Woke AI in the Federal Government.”

None of them sound nearly as hauntingly mysterious as a “Genesis Mission.” What's this AI-loving president up to now?

We're being promised a sort of AI and automation super-platform for the federal government. Based on my read of the program laid out in this order, the Secretary of Energy—fracking mogul Chris Wright—is supposed to unify all Department of Energy datasets with those of all federal agencies, and use those to create “scientific foundation models.” Presumably that means the government's own LLMs, or other LXMs used for scientific research.

Then our federal government is going to use its new AI models to build programs that “automate research workflows, and accelerate scientific breakthroughs.” We're getting set-it-and-forget-it federal science, in other words. The AI does the research, and a person can just come along and scoop up the breakthroughs like cream from a milk bucket.

According to Politico, Wright says there will be an “incredible increase in the pace of scientific discovery and innovation.” They're looking at nuclear fusion, other energy sources, pharmaceuticals, protein folding—all the areas of science and research that pair well with AI hype.

The executive order does, in all fairness, outline what the next year (and beyond) is supposed to look like for this program to some degree.

By the 60-day mark: A list.

America gets a document identifying 20 core science “challenges” the Genesis Mission can solve.

By the 90-day mark: An inventory.

America is gifted an inventory of computational resources the Genesis Mission can use to build its system.

By the 120-day mark: A plan.

By now, the Mission is supposed to have its data optimized and in place to train the models.

By the 240-day mark: Another inventory.

Wright is supposed to have figured out where robot-driven, automated science experiments can be done. Since it probably sounds like I'm joking, here's what the order says exactly:

“Within 240 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall review capabilities across the DOE national laboratories and other participating Federal research facilities for robotic laboratories and production facilities with the ability to engage in AI-directed experimentation and manufacturing, including automated and AI-augmented workflows and the related technical and operational standards needed.”

By the 270 day mark: A demo.

We get some sort of proof of concept for the Genesis Mission platform, focused on one of the 20 aforementioned challenges.

Within one year (and then every year from now on): An evaluation.

Were positive outcomes achieved? Did the Genesis Mission make scientific discoveries? How's everything going? It'll all be in the annual report.

And the Genesis Mission had better work, because the other side of this effort is a bunch of federal funding cuts for science. This administration has sought to cancel federal funding for (and subscriptions to) science journals. It has sought to cut $783 million in funding for health research—cuts that, it appears, really will go into effect. It has sought to cut off funding to no less than 100 climate change studies. It has reduced research spending at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration by $100 million, and on, and on.

The cuts may have had many aims, at least one of which was to curb DEI (remember when people used to talk about DEI?). Another one, it seems, is to shift science into the realm of things you can just automate, well before sufficient AI systems exist to justify anyone's confidence that such a thing is possible.

So buckle up for automated, low-cost scientific breakthroughs, everyone! They'll be here soon, thanks to the Chris Wright and the Genesis Mission. Otherwise, some of those funding cuts might start to look a little silly in retrospect.

My current community is a dozen identical duplexes primarily housing working class singles. We all rent. It's fairly easy to "temporarily" tie in to other units' utilities, whether power or water... it was only this past summer that I've had to put a lock on our utility closet (various "misunderstandings").Beginning summer 2024 a shanty-town started establishing itself just the next block over (just outside city limits)... which is worrysome but only for the winter fire risk (seem like mostly down-on-luck working-types).The previous summer there were a couple months of heavy car repo activity... us commoners are still hanging on, but I fear we won't remain not poorer for too much longer.

For the first time, both have a visible, noticeable homeless population. There are  homeless encampments in at least one. I have also noticed other encampments well outside of Quebec city and Montreal.In Berlin, the homeless population has also exploded, and is expected to get much worse. My friends in the US report similar changes.Things are getting significantly worse all over, it seems.

Video game franchise Far Cry is getting the series treatment from Noah Hawley (Alien: Earth) and Rob Mac (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia).

According to Variety, the dynamos from the sci-fi and comedy world are adapting Ubisoft's video game series that centers on survival in an action-packed genre setting. It could be an island where mad scientists are running experiments or extremist militias are rampaging through post-apocalyptic collapsed societies. The blend of action and anthology makes sense for Hawley, and the madcap energy of the narrative definitely befits Mac, who will also star.

So we're excited about the duo co-creating the live-action series for FX in the network's tried-and-true anthology format—Hawley's Fargo as well as American Horror Story come to mind.

“What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it's an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of Fargo is a variation on a theme,” Hawley told Variety. “To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I'm excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen.”

After what Hawley's done with Alien: Earth, we are so game for this. Far Cry marks Mac's second collaboration with Ubisoft Film and Television, having previously developed and starred in Mythic Quest for Apple TV. While the details of the show's plot remain under wraps, Mac hyped, “Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realized. Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support.”

Women with persistent thyroid hormone imbalance across pregnancy may be at an increased risk of having children with autism, according to a new study published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

Maternal thyroid hormones are essential for fetal neurodevelopment. Gestational thyroid imbalance has been associated with atypical neurodevelopment, including increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that affects how a person communicates, interacts with others and experiences the world.

We found that while adequately treated chronic thyroid dysfunction was not associated with increased autism risk in offspring, ongoing imbalance across multiple trimesters was. These findings underscore the need for routine monitoring and timely adjustment of therapy to maintain normal thyroid hormone levels throughout pregnancy."

Idan Menashe, Ph.D., Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beer Sheva, Israel

The study followed more than 51,000 births and found that mothers with persistent thyroid hormone imbalance across pregnancy were at an increased risk of having children with autism.

The authors also observed a dose-response pattern, in which the longer the duration of thyroid dysfunction across trimesters, the higher the risk.

Other study authors are Leena Elbedour of the Ben-Gurion University of the Nege; May Weinberg of the Meir Medical Center in Kfar Saba, Israel, and Tel Aviv University in Tel Aviv, Israel; Gal Meiri of the Soroka University Medical Center in Beer-Sheva, Israel, and the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev; and Analya Michaelovski of the Soroka University Medical Center.

Electroconvulsive therapy is a safe and effective treatment for elderly patients suffering from depression. This treatment often produces better results than in younger patients and could reduce the need for hospital care, according to new research from örebro University.Tor Arnison, a licensed psychologist and researcher in clinical epidemiology at örebro University, has conducted a registry study of more than 500 people aged 85 or older who have received electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). These patients were compared with an equally large group of younger patients as well as a group of people of the same age who also had depression but did not receive ECT.

We wanted to study people aged 85 years or older because they often have depression but are rarely included in research. Medications are known to cause more side effects in this age group. At the same time, knowledge is lacking about how effective and safe other forms of treatment, such as ECT, are for these patients."

Tor Arnison, licensed psychologist and researcher in clinical epidemiology, örebro University

The results show that ECT is highly effective in treating elderly patients. Approximately eight out of ten patients showed improvement, and over half made a full recovery. "They also had fewer hospital admissions after treatment than their peers who did not receive ECT. Side effects were relatively few and mainly consisted of temporary confusion or blood pressure effects," says Tor Arnison.He concludes that ECT is a safe and effective treatment even among the oldest patients - and that it often works better in this group than in younger patients."Advanced age in itself does not appear to be an inhibitor to ECT, and severe mental illness can be treated successfully even in very old age."

"The results show that ECT should be used more in this age group, especially when medication does not help or causes severe side effects. The study may help to reduce hesitation in healthcare and increase access to effective treatment for the oldest patients," says Tor Arnison.

New computer modeling could help scientists better understand how the retina regenerates, opening the door to new treatments for vision loss, according to a study from the University of Surrey.

The first-of-its-kind model is capable of detailing how the retina - the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye - can build its complex structure from just one type of stem cell, deepening our understanding of how sight develops and how its development could inform studies of injury or disease.

Using advanced agent-based modeling, the research team have simulated key stages of retinogenesis - the process by which identical progenitor cells diversify into the six types of neurons that make up the retina.

The model shows how simple genetic rules and subtle randomness work together to form the retina's precise layered architecture, a structure essential for how we see.

The paper was presented at IWWBIO 2025 and published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).

Cayla Harris, lead researcher from the University of Surrey's Nature Inspired Computing and Engineering Group, said:

"The beauty of biology is that complex structures can emerge from simple rules. Our simulations show how genetically identical cells can, through intrinsic bias and chance, self-organize into the retina's highly ordered layers - a pattern that underpins how we see the world."

Using the BioDynaMo software platform, the team modelled virtual "cells" that grow, divide and make fate decisions based on internal gene-regulation logic, mimicking biological behavior. They tested different network designs for how genes might interact when cells decide what kind of neuron to become.

Two particular designs - called the Reentry and Multidirectional models - reproduced real biological data most accurately, suggesting that retinal cells may make their fate decisions through overlapping and flexible genetic pathways, rather than a fixed sequence.

This approach could help researchers better understand not only healthy eye development but also what happens in retinal diseases and in regenerative research exploring how stem cells might rebuild tissue.

Computational modeling gives us a powerful way to explore biological processes we can't easily observe in real time. By simulating every cell's decision and interaction, we can test hypotheses about how tissues like the retina form - and how to restore them when damaged."

Dr. Roman Bauer, senior author on the study, University of Surrey

This research is supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).

Cayla Harris added:

"We think that our research is a step forward in linking genetics, computation and developmental biology to understand one of the body's most complex neural structures."

Scientists have uncovered a surprising mechanism by which a brain enzyme called OTULIN controls the expression of tau, the protein that forms toxic tangles in Alzheimer's disease. The findings, published today in Genomic Psychiatry, reveal that OTULIN functions not only as expected in protein degradation pathways but also plays a previously unknown role as a master regulator of gene expression and RNA metabolism.

The research team, led by Dr. Kiran Bhaskar at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center and Dr. Francesca-Fang Liao at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, made the discovery while investigating how neurons clear abnormal tau aggregates. Their unexpected findings could open new therapeutic avenues for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias affecting millions worldwide.

We set out to test whether stabilizing a specific type of ubiquitin chain would help clear toxic tau from neurons. Instead, we discovered something completely unexpected – that OTULIN acts as a master switch controlling whether tau is even produced in the first place."

 Dr. Kiran Bhaskar, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center

The research team initially hypothesized that inhibiting OTULIN's enzyme activity would enhance tau clearance through cellular garbage disposal systems. However, when they completely knocked out the OTULIN gene in neurons, tau disappeared entirely – not because it was being degraded faster, but because it wasn't being made at all.

"This was a paradigm shift in our thinking," said Dr. Liao. "We found that OTULIN deficiency causes tau mRNA to vanish, along with massive changes in how the cell processes RNA and controls gene expression."

The study used neurons derived from a patient with late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease, which showed elevated levels of both OTULIN protein and phosphorylated tau compared to healthy control neurons. This correlation suggested OTULIN might be contributing to disease progression.

The research revealed several crucial insights:

First, when OTULIN was completely removed from neuroblastoma cells, comprehensive RNA sequencing showed dramatic changes in gene expression – 13,341 genes were downregulated and 774 were upregulated, with even more dramatic effects on RNA transcripts (43,003 downregulated, 1,113 upregulated). Comparing Alzheimer's patient neurons to healthy controls revealed over 4,500 genes and 5,600 transcripts were differentially expressed.

Second, pharmacological inhibition of OTULIN's enzymatic activity with a novel small molecule inhibitor (UC495) reduced phosphorylated tau levels in Alzheimer's disease neurons, suggesting potential therapeutic benefit without complete gene elimination.

Third, the absence of OTULIN upregulated numerous genes associated with RNA degradation and stability regulation, including components of the CCR4-NOT complex and various RNA-binding proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.

Fourth, bulk RNA sequencing of Alzheimer's neurons revealed significant downregulation of OTULIN long noncoding RNA alongside decreased expression of melanoma antigen gene (MAGE) family members, which activate ubiquitin ligases involved in protein quality control.

These findings have profound implications for treating tauopathies, a group of more than 20 neurodegenerative diseases characterized by toxic tau accumulation.

"OTULIN could serve as a novel drug target, but our findings suggest we need to modulate its activity carefully rather than eliminate it completely," Dr. Bhaskar noted. "Complete loss causes widespread changes in cellular RNA metabolism that could have unintended consequences."

The research demonstrated that partial inhibition with UC495 reduced pathological tau forms without eliminating total tau or causing apparent toxicity to neurons. This suggests a therapeutic window exists where OTULIN activity could be tuned to beneficial levels.

The team also discovered that OTULIN deficiency prevents the development of autoinflammation in neurons by downregulating inflammatory pathway components, providing additional insight into how cells balance protein quality control with inflammatory responses.

Beyond Alzheimer's disease, the findings illuminate fundamental mechanisms of RNA metabolism regulation in neurons. The researchers identified upregulation of transcriptional repressors like YY1 and SP3 in OTULIN-deficient cells, along with changes in RNA-binding ubiquitin ligases RC3H2 and MEX3C that control mRNA stability.

"We're essentially looking at a previously unknown checkpoint in gene expression," explained Dr. Liao. "OTULIN appears to influence which genes get expressed and how long their RNA messages survive in cells."

The study also revealed connections between OTULIN and multiple neurodegenerative disease-associated RNA-binding proteins, including TDP-43, FMR1, ATXN2, and MSI1, suggesting broader implications for understanding various brain disorders.

The team used cutting-edge techniques including CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from Alzheimer's patients and healthy controls, comprehensive bulk RNA sequencing, and computational drug design to identify the OTULIN inhibitor UC495.

They validated their findings across multiple cell types, including patient-derived neurons and human neuroblastoma cells, ensuring reproducibility and relevance to human disease.

The researchers are now working to understand precisely how OTULIN influences gene expression and RNA metabolism at the molecular level. They're also testing whether carefully calibrated OTULIN inhibition can reduce tau pathology in animal models of Alzheimer's disease.

"This discovery opens up an entirely new research direction," said Dr. Bhaskar. "We need to determine whether targeting OTULIN therapeutically can safely reduce tau accumulation without disrupting essential cellular functions."

The team is also investigating why OTULIN long noncoding RNA is reduced in Alzheimer's neurons and whether restoring its levels could normalize OTULIN protein expression and tau pathology.

This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and involved collaboration between the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, and other institutions. The comprehensive RNA sequencing data have been deposited in publicly accessible databases to enable further research by scientists worldwide.

The findings represent years of meticulous work combining molecular biology, cell biology, genomics, and computational approaches to unravel the complex relationship between protein quality control systems and neurodegenerative disease.

Alzheimer's disease affects more than 6 million Americans and is characterized by two pathological hallmarks: amyloid plaques and tau tangles. Tau pathology correlates more closely with cognitive decline than amyloid accumulation, making it a critical therapeutic target.

Tauopathies encompass more than 20 brain diseases where tau forms toxic aggregates, including frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Current treatments provide only modest symptomatic relief without addressing underlying disease mechanisms.

The discovery that OTULIN regulates tau at the gene expression level, rather than simply controlling its degradation, represents a fundamental advance in understanding how tau pathology develops and suggests novel intervention strategies.

In a new JNeurosci paper, Tian-Ming Gao and colleagues, from Southern Medical University, explored how adenosine triphosphate (ATP) signaling relates to depression and anxiety using male mice. ATP is a molecule that not only provides energy but also supports communication between neurons. The researchers focused on ATP signaling in a brain region implicated in depression called the hippocampus. 

Male mice that were more likely to acquire depressive- and anxiety-like symptoms following long-term stress had less ATP levels and reduced expression of a protein involved in ATP release (connexin 43). When the research team genetically dampened or deleted connexin 43 in cells that release ATP in another group of mice, this alone led to depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors and lowered ATP levels. Bridging the findings together, in distressed mice, restoring connexin 43 in the hippocampus brought ATP levels up to normal and improved behavioral outcomes. 

This is the first direct evidence that deficient ATP release in [a region of the] hippocampus drives both depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, revealing a shared molecular pathway [for these conditions]."

Tian-Ming Gao, Southern Medical University

Gao also emphasizes that the findings linking connexin 43 to this mechanism point to a potential treatment target for treating depression and anxiety when they occur at the same time. Of note, the researchers plan to assess both sexes in future studies.

Neuroscientists at the University of Cambridge have identified five "major epochs" of brain structure over the course of a human life, as our brains rewire to support different ways of thinking while we grow, mature, and ultimately decline.

A study led by Cambridge's MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit compared the brains of 3,802 people between zero and ninety years old using datasets of MRI diffusion scans, which map neural connections by tracking how water molecules move through brain tissue.

In a study published in Nature Communications, scientists say they detected five broad phases of brain structure in the average human life, split up by four pivotal "turning points" between birth and death when our brains reconfigure.

Childhood brain "topology" runs from birth until a turning point at the age of nine, when it transitions to the adolescent phase – an era that lasts right up to the age of 32, on average.

Our early thirties see the brain's neural wiring shift into adult mode. This is the longest era, which lasts over three decades. A third turning point around age 66 marks the start of an "early aging" phase of brain architecture. Finally, the "late aging" brain takes shape at around 83 years old.

"We know the brain's wiring is crucial to our development, but we lack a big picture of how it changes across our lives and why," said Dr. Alexa Mousley, a Gates Cambridge Scholar who led the research. "This study is the first to identify major phases of brain wiring across a human lifespan."

"These eras provide important context for what our brains might be best at, or more vulnerable to, at different stages of our lives. It could help us understand why some brains develop differently at key points in life, whether it be learning difficulties in childhood, or dementia in our later years."

From infancy through childhood, our brains are defined by "network consolidation", as the wealth of synapses – the connectors between neurons – overproduced in a baby's brain are whittled down, with the more active ones surviving.

Across the whole brain, connections rewire in the same pattern from birth until about nine years old.

Meanwhile, grey and white matter grow rapidly in volume, so that cortical thickness – the distance between outer grey matter and inner white matter – reaches a peak, and cortical folding, the characteristic ridges on the outer brain, stabilises.

By the first turning point at nine years old, the brain is experiencing a step-change in cognitive capacity, as well as an increased risk of mental health disorders.

The second "epoch" of the brain, the adolescence era, sees white matter continue to grow in volume, so organisation of the brain's communications networks is increasingly refined, as measured by the diffusion of water in the scans.

This era is defined by the efficiency of connections both within specific regions as well as rapid communication right across the whole brain, which is related to enhanced cognitive performance.

"Neural efficiency is as you might imagine, well connected by short paths, and the adolescent era is the only one in which this efficiency is increasing," said Mousley.

These developments peak in the early thirties, on average, which is the "strongest topological turning point" of the entire lifespan say researchers.

Around the age of 32, we see the most directional changes in wiring and largest overall shift in trajectory, compared to all the other turning points.

While puberty offers a clear start, the end of adolescence is much harder to pin down scientifically. Based purely on neural architecture, we found that adolescent-like changes in brain structure end around the early thirties."

Dr. Alexa Mousley, a Gates Cambridge Scholar

At age 32, the longest era, that of adulthood, begins. Brain architecture stabilises compared to previous phases – with no major turning points for thirty years. This corresponds with a "plateau in intelligence and personality" based on other studies, say researchers.

They also found "segregation" is more noticeable during this epoch, as regions slowly start to become more compartmentalised.

The turning point at age 66 is far milder, and not defined by any major structural shifts, although researchers still found meaningful changes to the pattern of brain networks on average at around this age.

"The data suggest that a gradual reorganisation of brain networks culminates in the mid-sixties," said Mousley. "This is probably related to aging, with further reduced connectivity as white matter starts to degenerate.

"This is an age when people face increased risk for a variety of health conditions that can affect the brain, such as hypertension." 

The last turning point comes around age 83, and the final brain structure epoch is entered. While data is limited for this era, the defining feature is a shift from global to local, as whole brain connectivity declines even further, with increased reliance on certain regions.

"Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras," added senior author Prof Duncan Astle, Professor of Neuroinformatics at Cambridge.

"Many neurodevelopmental, mental health and neurological conditions are linked to the way the brain is wired. Indeed, differences in brain wiring predict difficulties with attention, language, memory, and a whole host of different behaviours"

"Understanding that the brain's structural journey is not a question of steady progression, but rather one of a few major turning points, will help us identify when and how its wiring is vulnerable to disruption."

The research was supported by the Medical Research Council, Gates Foundation and Templeton World Charitable Foundation.

Patients with the deadliest form of brain cancer, glioblastoma, who received MRI-guided focused ultrasound with standard-of-care chemotherapy had a nearly 40 percent increase in overall survival in a landmark trial of 34 patients led by University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) researchers. This is the first time researchers have demonstrated a potential survival benefit from using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier to improve delivery of chemotherapy to the tumor site in brain cancer patients after surgery.

Our results are very encouraging. Using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier and deliver chemotherapy could significantly increase patient survival, which other ongoing studies are seeking to confirm and expand."

Graeme Woodworth, MD, study principal investigator, Professor and Chair of Neurosurgery at UMSOM and Neurosurgeon-In-Chief at the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC)

The findings of this groundbreaking safety, feasibility, and comparative trial involved glioblastoma patients who were given focused ultrasound to open their blood-brain barrier before getting chemotherapy; they were matched to a rigorously selected control group of 185 glioblastoma patients with similar characteristics who received the standard dose of the chemotherapy drug, temozolomide, without receiving focused ultrasound. Trial participants were initially treated with surgery to remove their brain tumor, followed by six weeks of chemotherapy and radiation, and up to six monthly focused-ultrasound treatments plus temozolomide.

Results were published in the journal Lancet Oncology and show that trial participants had nearly 14 months of median progression-free survival, compared to eight months in the control group. In terms of overall survival, trial participants, on average, lived for more than 30 months compared to 19 months in the control group.

The study builds on more than a decade of intensive research to test the safety and feasibility of opening the blood-brain barrier using focused ultrasound first in animal studies and then in patients. It was led by Dr. Woodworth and was conducted at UMMC and four other clinical sites affiliated with the University of Toronto, Harvard University, University of Virginia, and West Virginia University. "We also demonstrated that this could be a useful technique that enables us to better monitor patients to determine if their brain cancer has progressed," said Dr. Woodworth, who also serves as Director of the Brain Tumor Program at the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMGCCC).

He and his team demonstrated that opening the blood-brain barrier facilitated the use of a "liquid biopsy," which is a blood test that detects cancer biomarkers, which can include DNA fragments, proteins and other components from the liquid environment surrounding the tumor site.

Such biomarkers have been used in other cancers to determine whether the tumor has remained stable or has the potential to progress or even metastasize. Up until now, however, these tests have not been utilized in brain cancer patients since most components can never pass into the bloodstream from the brain due to the blood-brain barrier."These liquid biomarkers were found to be closely concordant with the patient outcomes over time, progression-free survival and overall survival," said Dr. Woodworth.

While temozolomide is the standard treatment for glioblastoma, the drug typically gets blocked by the blood-brain barrier with studies showing that less than 20 percent reaches the brain in patients. This study did not determine the exact amount of temozolomide to reach the brain in each patient, but earlier studies have shown that opening the blood-brain barrier before delivering chemotherapy can dramatically increase the amount that gets to the original tumor site.

Glioblastoma is the most common and deadliest type of malignant brain tumor. The five-year survival rate is only 5.5 percent, and patients live an average of 14 to 16 months after diagnosis when treated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy when appropriate. The malignancy nearly always recurs even after it is removed due to residual infiltrating cancer cells that remain after treatment.

The blood-brain barrier is a specialized network of vascular and brain cells that acts as the brain's security system to protect against invasion by dangerous toxins and microbes. It can be opened temporarily using a specialized focused ultrasound device. This process starts with injecting microscopic inert gas-filled bubbles into the patient's bloodstream. Guided by an MRI, precise brain regions are targeted while the injected microbubbles are circulating.

"Upon excitation under low-intensity ultrasound waves, the microbubbles oscillate within the energy field, causing temporary mechanical perturbations in the walls of the brain blood vessels," said Pavlos Anastasiadis, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Neurosurgery at UMSOM who is an expert in ultrasound biophysics.

Prior studies led by Dr. Woodworth and this trial's co-investigators showed that opening the blood-brain barrier temporarily can be safely and feasibly performed in brain tumor patients. He and his team conducted this procedure in the first brain cancer patient in the U.S. in 2018 at UMMC after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the inaugural clinical trial.

"Dr. Woodworth's findings are deeply exciting and a significant step forward for the field," said Taofeek K. Owonikoko, MD, PhD, UMGCCC Executive Director. "Patients with glioblastoma have had few effective treatment options, and UMGCCC is proud to be at the forefront of efforts to bring hope to these patients and their families."

Future trials could use focused ultrasound alongside other chemotherapy agents to test the effectiveness of drugs never used in brain cancer due to their ineffectiveness at crossing the blood-brain barrier.

"This groundbreaking trial has provided a potential new prognostic and therapeutic paradigm for the 15,000 Americans who are diagnosed every year with this deadly form of brain cancer," said UMSOM Dean Mark T. Gladwin, MD, who is the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and Vice President for Medical Affairs at University of Maryland, Baltimore. "The release of biomarkers into the bloodstream offers a possible new method for simple and routine monitoring of brain regions without the need for invasive biopsies. Having the ability to open the blood-brain barrier could also usher in the testing of new therapeutics to see whether they offer further life-extending benefits."

"For the thousands of people who receive this devastating diagnosis each year, the significance of this advancement cannot be overstated," said Bert W. O'Malley, MD, President and CEO of UMMC. "The success of this trial brings new momentum and further accelerates investigation of targeted therapies for glioblastoma and other brain cancers. Hope has been redefined for these families."

Dr. Woodworth is also the co-leader of a larger diagnostics-focused pivotal focused ultrasound trial in glioblastoma patients called LIBERATE (NCT05383872) in partnership with ReFOCUSED (The Research Consortium for Transcranial Focused UltraSound-Enhanced Drug Delivery & Diagnostics.) ReFOCUSED is a growing group of researchers from over 20 sites across North America whose goal is to use the new opportunities offered by MRI-guided focused ultrasound to improve the clinical outcomes of brain diseases. The LIBERATE trial is currently closed to enrollment.

This trial was funded by the device manufacturer Insightec Inc. (Miami, FL), an MRI-guided focused ultrasound device company, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (R21NS113016).

Background: In this study, researchers aimed to understand how general practitioners experience trust in their patients, and how that trust affects patient care. Researchers interviewed 25 general practitioners across Australia. 

What this study found:

Interviewees ranged from 28 to 65 years old.

Three themes described general practitioners' trust in patients: 

General practitioners' trust in patients was an assumed starting point. General practitioners expressed a lack of trust in some complex patients' ability to navigate the health system, but not in the patients themselves.

Trust in patients deepens and develops over time as part of a mutual trusting therapeutic relationship.

General practitioners had difficulty trusting patients who were perceived to be manipulating the relationship for secondary gain. Participants attempted to understand their patient's situation and establish a trusting relationship even when this was the case. 

Implications: Strengthening systems and training that support general practitioners in maintaining trusting relationships, especially with complex or high-needs patients, can improve continuity and quality of care.

Background: In this study, researchers examined whether people who follow higher-GI or higher-GL diets have different risks of developing lung cancer. They used data from 101,732 adults in the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial cohort who filled out a detailed diet questionnaire when they joined the study (1993–2001). These adults were followed for about 12 years to see who developed lung cancer. The researchers then compared people with the highest GI and GL to those with the lowest, accounting for smoking and other factors.

What this study found:

Glycemic index: People who ate diets with the highest glycemic index had a higher chance of lung cancer than those with the lowest glycemic index - about 13% higher overall - including higher risks for both non–small cell and small cell lung cancer.

Glycemic load: People who ate diets with the highest glycemic load had a lower chance of lung cancer than those with the lowest glycemic load - about 28% lower overall - and the pattern was similar for non–small cell lung cancer. There was no clear link for small cell lung cancer.

Implications: Diets that contain fewer amounts of high glycemic index foods and higher amounts of high-quality carbohydrates, such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, may be linked to lower lung cancer risk.

Latinos face significant health disparities, especially in chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, and cancer. Primary care clinicians play a critical role in managing and preventing these diseases, yet Latinos face multiple barriers to quality care.

In April 2024, the Primary Care Latino Equity Research (PRIMER) Center convened the Latino Primary Care Summit on "Chronic Conditions in Latinos: Trends, Innovations and Care for the Future." This special report summarizes the discussions at the summit and outlines key research areas and the advances needed to answer questions crucial to Latino primary care, outlining seven recommendations.

The report urges pairing research with policy partners so evidence moves into practice, consistently disaggregating Latino data, and investing in the mentorship and career advancement of Latino scientists and students. It also calls for expediting implementation research in real-world primary care settings that serve Latino communities and for co-designing communication practices and new technologies with those communities. The report recommends using telemedicine and AI equitably and studying multigenerational households and policy eligibility frictions to design trauma-informed interventions that fit Latino family life.

The web survey used the Medical AI Readiness Scale (MAIRS), which rates four areas: cognition (understanding), ability (skills), vision (future value), and ethics. The maximum possible score is 110, with higher scores indicating greater readiness.

What this study found:

Overall readiness was moderate (median 69/110) with wide variation.

About one-quarter of participants said they never use AI in family medicine, and frequent use was uncommon.

Participants who reported knowing more about current AI applications and how AI is used in health care scored higher on readiness.

Age and training level were not linked to readiness in this sample.

Implications: AI tools are advancing quickly but uneven readiness and low day-to-day use suggest a need for training and curricula tailored to primary care.

Researchers from University of California San Diego have identified 11 genetic regions linked to delay discounting - the tendency to prefer smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed ones - shedding new light on how impulsive decision-making relates to both mental and physical health. The study, published on Nov. 25, 2025 in Molecular Psychiatry, analyzed genome-wide data from 134,935 23andMe participants and found that the same genetic factors that influence impulsive decision-making also overlap with risks for conditions like obesity, diabetes and other metabolic health issues.

Impulsive decision-making is something we all experience, but its biological roots have been surprisingly difficult to pin down. These findings show that delay discounting is not just a behavioral tendency, it is deeply intertwined with genetic pathways involved in brain development, cognition and physical health."

Sandra Sanchez-Roige, Ph.D., associate professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine and senior author of the study

Building on a previous genome-wide association study five times smaller, the team mapped 11 independent genetic regions and identified 93 candidate genes associated with delay discounting. Several of these genes were involved in dopamine signaling, neuronal growth metabolic pathways and brain structure - systems also implicated in psychiatric disorders, obesity, chronic pain and educational outcomes. Subsequent analyses found genetic correlations between delay discounting and 73 traits ranging from substance use and depression to gastrointestinal disorders and sleep duration.

The researchers also conducted a network analysis to determine which biological mechanisms are shared across traits. "We found clusters of overlapping pathways - particularly involving cognition, metabolism and externalizing behaviors - that may explain why delay discounting is a common feature across many mental health conditions," said Abraham A. Palmer, Ph.D., professor and vice chair for basic research in the Department of Psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine and co-author of the study. Additional analyses showed that many associations persisted even after adjusting for cognitive measures such as intelligence and educational attainment, indicating that delay discounting has a partially distinct genetic basis.

To explore downstream clinical impacts, the team developed polygenic scores for delay discounting and tested them in a hospital cohort of more than 66,000 individuals. "We identified that these scores, which represent the genetic tendency to favor smaller immediate rewards, were associated with 212 medical outcomes, including type 2 diabetes, chronic pain, ischemic heart disease, mood disorders and tobacco use disorder", said first author Hayley Thorpe, Ph.D., a visiting scholar in Sanchez-Roige's lab and postdoctoral researcher at Western University. "This highlights how impulsive decision-making may influence long-term health risk".

"Understanding the genetic and biological roots of delay discounting opens up many new possibilities," Sanchez-Roige said. "In the future, delay discounting could become a clinically useful marker, one that helps us improve behavioral and pharmacological treatments aimed at impulsivity." Unlike many studies that examine the causes of specific disease, "these studies explore the genetic basis of trans-diagnostic genetic tendencies, which are the fundamental building blocks that influence people's behavior throughout life and are interwoven with disease susceptibility, as well as economic and social outcomes" adds Palmer.

The authors note that while the study identifies promising genetic targets, future research should explore causal relationships and test whether modifying delay discounting can improve health outcomes. They also emphasize the need for replication of newly discovered genetic associations and for studies integrating environmental factors such as socioeconomic status.

"Delay discounting is measurable, highly heritable and relevant to many aspects of health," Sanchez-Roige added. "By continuing to investigate this fundamental decision-making process, we may uncover new ways to prevent or treat a wide range of conditions."

A controlled feeding study out of South Dakota State University shows that older adults who ate fewer ultra-processed foods naturally consumed fewer calories, lost weight and abdominal fat, and showed improvements in insulin, nutrient-sensing hormones, and inflammation.

Counting nutrients is not enough. The degree of processing changes how the body handles those same nutrients. Diet quality depends not only on nutrients but also on the ingredients and the level of processing, considered together."

Moul Dey, professor of health and nutritional sciences

For decades, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans have urged balance and moderation, yet rates of obesity and other chronic diseases have continued to rise. The Dietary Guidelines currently include no clear directive on ultra-processed foods, but this study shows that when diets meet DGA nutrient goals while minimizing ultra-processed food and ingredients, calorie intake drops and metabolic health improves. The findings are the first to demonstrate that the DGA framework can deliver stronger health benefits when the level of food processing is also considered.

Ultra-processed foods are industrial products made by reconstructing parts of whole foods with synthetic additives such as flavors, colors, preservatives, and emulsifiers. They dominate modern diets, providing more than half of U.S. adults' daily calories and about 70 percent of the national food supply. In simpler terms, if it comes wrapped in plastic and lists ingredients you wouldn't keep in your kitchen, it's probably ultra-processed.

Meals in the study were designed and administered by the university's human nutrition research team, prepared by a professional local chef, and eaten at home by clinical trial participants to reflect everyday eating patterns. Very few feeding trials have examined how ultra-processed foods affect Americans' health. The first major study, conducted entirely inside a research center, compared diets made up of almost entirely ultra-processed foods to diets with none. This second trial tested a more realistic shift, reducing ultra-processed foods from about half of daily calories to about 15 percent within nutritionally balanced menus for free-living older adults in the United States.

"Older adults often face metabolic challenges as appetite and energy needs shift," said Dey, the senior author and principal investigator of the study. "We saw that when ultra-processed food intake went down, total calories and metabolic risk markers did too."

Saba Vaezi, a doctoral student researcher in Dey's laboratory and first author of the collaborative study, said the findings show that simple substitutions, rather than restrictive dieting, can make measurable differences. "Participants did not count calories or follow complicated weight-loss instructions," she said.

The study is among a handful of rigorously controlled feeding trials in free-living older adults that:

Older adults completed an 18-week feeding study with two diet periods of eight weeks each, separated by a short break of at least two weeks. Every meal and snack was fully prepared and provided to eat at home. One diet was meat-based, featuring pork as the main protein source, and the other was plant-based, centered on lentils, beans and peas. Both followed the nutrient goals of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

A companion method paper published by Dey and her team in Current Developments in Nutrition confirmed strong participant adherence and described the complex operations that made this real-world feeding study possible.

On average, participants spontaneously reduced calorie intake and experienced about 10% total body fat loss and 13% belly fat loss during both diet phases, along with a 23% improvement in insulin sensitivity and favorable changes in inflammatory markers and nutrient-sensing hormone levels. Daily calorie intake decreased by roughly 400 calories per day, even without instructions to restrict calories. These results suggest that replacing ultra processed food with minimally processed ones can enhance metabolic efficiency and body composition in older adults, within balanced, American Guidelines–aligned diets. The study also demonstrates that high dietary quality and lower processing can be achieved in practical, take-home meal programs.

Researchers note that the 18-week trial included a small sample of 36 participants who completed the study, and that larger studies are needed to confirm long-term outcomes. At the one-year follow-up, when participants' ultra-processed food intake gradually increased again, many of the metabolic improvements observed during the trial diminished, suggesting that benefits depend on sustained reductions in ultra-processed foods. Still, the consistency of effects across both diet patterns underscores the central role of food processing in metabolic health.

"This study moves past the usual debate over whether plant-based or animal-based diets are better," Dey said. "Both can be health-promoting when foods are simply prepared and nutritionally balanced."

Swallowing difficulties, or dysphagia, affect up to 80% of people with Parkinson's disease and can lead to serious complications, including malnutrition, aspiration and reduced quality of life.

With a new three-year, $1.9 million grant from the Department of Defense, Giselle Carnaby, PhD, MPH, a researcher at UT Health San Antonio, the academic health center of The University of Texas at San Antonio, will lead a phase 2, multisite clinical trial to test a novel treatment program designed to strengthen and retrain swallowing function in people with early Parkinson's.

The randomized, double-blind clinical trial will enroll about 80 participants who are between the ages of 30 and 90, diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and are active-duty U.S. service members, veterans or direct relatives of service members.

This study represents an important step forward for people who struggle with swallowing disorders. We know these problems have a profound effect on health and independence, yet treatment options remain limited."

Giselle Carnaby, PhD, MPH, researcher at UT Health San Antonio, professor in the departments of Health Sciences, and Communication Sciences and Disorders, School of Health Professions, The University of Texas at San Antonio

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects movement, caused by the breakdown of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. There is no cure for this disease, and treatments are limited. Along with tremors and muscle stiffness, many patients experience difficulties with the motor control of their mouth and throat muscles, which affects their ability to swallow food and liquids.

Swallowing is one of the most complex tasks the human body performs, involving nearly 30 muscles and a network of brain regions. In Parkinson's disease, the same neurodegenerative changes that impair walking and speech also disrupt swallowing-related brain pathways, weakening their ability to send clear signals to the muscles involved.

"It's like the brain's radio is slightly off the station," Carnaby said. "You can still hear the signal, but it doesn't always get through clearly. Sometimes it comes in loud and clear; other times it's fuzzy. The result is that the messages to the muscles can become haphazard, which can disrupt the timing and coordination of swallowing."

This communication breakdown can cause food or liquid to move more slowly, get held up or even enter the airway – called aspiration – which can lead to persistent coughing and lung infections. By targeting these brain-muscle connections with structured swallowing therapy, Carnaby and her team aim to retrain and bolster the physiological processes to support safe, effective swallowing.

Carnaby and her research team recently completed a pilot study that tested an intensive swallowing exercise program in a small group of Parkinson's patients. Participants practiced targeted swallowing tasks with therapist supervision, emphasizing both strength and muscle coordination.

The results were encouraging. Participants who completed the program showed improvements in swallowing, along with increased confidence in eating and fewer choking and coughing episodes.

"Even though Parkinson's is progressive, what we found in the pilot was that patients could make real, meaningful gains," Carnaby said. "That gave us the validation to pursue a larger, controlled trial."

The newly funded project will expand on this early work. The study will compare outcomes between individuals receiving the proactive swallowing intervention, called "SwallowFIT," and those undergoing usual care.

The primary recruitment site will be Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, which has a movement disorders clinic with specialized neurologists and neurophysiologists involved in the project. For this study, swallow treatment will be conducted at UT Health San Antonio, which will also serve as a data repository.

In addition to Carnaby, the study team includes Jonathan Gelfond, MD, PhD, associate professor and chief of biostatistics in the Department of Population Health Sciences within UT San Antonio's Long School of Medicine, as well as Lt. Col. Alexis Nelson, MD, and Maj. Jessie Jacobson, DO, who are both neurologists at Brooke Army Medical Center.

The research team will track improvements in swallowing along with longer-term outcomes at three and six months. These include swallowing clinical metrics, aspiration rates, nutritional status and hospitalizations. Advanced imaging and physiological measures will be used to better understand how the therapy alters swallowing efficiency and biomechanics.

While not directly part of the study, the control group will be offered the chance to receive the treatment following the study.

"After the pilot study, the effects were so strong that the research team felt it wouldn't be responsible or ethical to restrict the treatment to only half of the patients," Carnaby said. "So, it will be available to (the control group participants) if they want it."

The program is built on the principles of neuroplasticity, which is the brain's ability to adapt and reorganize connections and processes. Study participants will complete structured swallowing exercises twice a week, focusing on strengthening muscles of the mouth, tongue and throat, combined with coordination drills to improve timing and control of the swallowing process.

Sessions will continue for six weeks with trained speech-language pathologists at the university. In addition to in-clinic therapy, participants are encouraged to perform daily guided exercises at home.

"The exercises may look simple, but they're designed to push the system in very specific ways," Carnaby said. "We're trying to recalibrate motor pathways so that swallowing becomes safer and more efficient."

By improving swallowing, the intervention has the potential to directly reduce the risk of negative swallowing consequences such as aspiration, which is the leading cause of death in people with Parkinson's. It may also help patients maintain adequate nutrition and hydration, supporting overall health and quality of life.

Equally important, Carnaby said, are the psychological and social benefits.

"Being able to share a meal with family without fear of coughing and choking is incredibly powerful," she said. "We hope this therapy will give patients more confidence and independence in their daily lives."

If successful, the trial could lay the groundwork for widespread adoption of proactive swallowing intervention as a standard component of early Parkinson's care. Carnaby envisions future studies that refine and personalize this therapy, possibly combining the swallowing exercises with medications or neuromodulation approaches to further enhance outcomes.

"There's a need for therapies that go beyond symptom management alone to address the mechanisms of functional decline," she said. "Our goal is to slow or even prevent some of the most debilitating complications of Parkinson's disease."

As Parkinson's is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disease, the findings from this study could have direct implications for nearly 1 million Americans affected by the condition.

"This is about giving patients more time and a better quality of life," Carnaby said. "That's what drives our work every day."

In a study led by researchers at Mass General Brigham, pregnant individuals who stopped taking popular weight loss GLP-1 medications before or early in their pregnancy tended to gain more weight and have higher risks of diabetes and hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, and experienced preterm delivery more so than people who had never taken GLP-1 drugs. The findings are published in JAMA.

The use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists-or GLP-1RAs-has increased dramatically, but recommendations suggest their discontinuation before pregnancy because there's not enough information about their safety for unborn babies. We sought to assess how such discontinuation affects weight gain and outcomes during pregnancy."

Jacqueline Maya, MD, lead author, pediatric endocrinologist, Mass General Brigham for Children

For the study, the team analyzed electronic health records for 1,792 pregnancies delivered within the Mass General Brigham healthcare system between 2016–2025, primarily among women with obesity. Each woman with a GLP-1RA prescription within three years before and up to 90 days after conception was matched to three similar pregnancies where the mother did not use GLP-1RAs.

Individuals who stopped GLP-1RAs before or in early pregnancy gained an average of 7.2 pounds more weight during pregnancy than those who did not use the weight loss drugs. The GLP-1RA group also had a 32% higher risk of excess weight gain (gaining more than recommended), a 30% higher risk of diabetes during pregnancy, a 29% higher risk of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, and a 34% higher risk of preterm delivery. There were no differences in risk of high or low birth weight, birth length, or Cesarean delivery.

"Additional studies are needed on the balance of pre-pregnancy benefits of GLP-1s with the risks associated with interrupting them for pregnancy," said senior author Camille E. Powe, MD, a Mass General Brigham endocrinologist and co-director of the Diabetes in Pregnancy Program at Massachusetts General Hospital. "We need to do more research to find ways to help manage weight gain and reduce risks during pregnancy when stopping GLP-1 medications."

Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo's recent comments regarding his disregard for the importance of winning a FIFA World Cup as it pertains to his own soccer legacy have not gone down well with one former U.S. Men's National Team star turned pundit.

In a wide-ranging recent interview with Piers Morgan, 40-year-old Ronaldo, who is currently the highest-paid athlete in the world with Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr, said, “If you ask me, ‘Cristiano, is it a dream to win the World Cup?' No, it's not a dream. To win a World Cup is not going to change my name in the history of football. I'm not gonna lie.”

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner went on to explain that, in his eyes, winning the World Cup won't alter his standing in the pantheon of soccer greatness, adding, “To define what? To define if I'm one of the best in history, to win one competition, [of] six games, seven games. You think it's fair?”

Ronaldo, who is perhaps best known for his stints with Real Madrid and Manchester United, did concede the importance of winning a World Cup would represent for his home nation.

“How many World Cups win Argentina before [Lionel] Messi? How many? I don't know, two times? Yeah, maybe two, I think,” he said. “Yeah, but it's normal. These countries, they are used to win big competitions. Brazil, if they win the World Cup, they will surprise the world. No. If Portugal win the World Cup, which is possible, they will shock the world. Yes, but in my mind, I don't think in that way.

“Of course, you want to win, yeah. When you compete, you want to win. I'm honest, for me, it's not going to change the way I see things and the way I see football.”

Ronaldo's comments didn't sit well with Taylor Twellman, however, who was quick to label the five-time World Cup participant “a fraud” on the 'It's Called Soccer' podcast. He went on to claim that Ronaldo had been proclaiming how winning the tournament was his dream prior to Argentina's win at the most recent competition in 2022, adding, “Now that Messi's won it and he can't, now it's not a dream. What the F—.”

Asked why Ronaldo would make such a comment, especially given how strong Portugal appears to be heading into the 2026 tournament, Twellman commented, “Anything about Cristiano is about Cristiano. So, I get that. But, for me, (head coach) Roberto Martinez must be like, ‘Really, dude that's what you're saying now? Like that's what we're doing now? Now we're doing that. Right now, before the World Cup?'”

Ronaldo may not be putting too much pressure on himself when it comes to winning the 2026 World Cup in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, despite having admitted that this will be his final attempt, but thanks to a generous FIFA ruling, he will be able to participate from day one.

Recently sent off for the first time in his international career, during a 2-0 loss to the Republic of Ireland in their second-to-last qualifier, FIFA slapped Ronaldo with a three-game ban, which he began by missing their dominant 9-1 group finale win over Armenia, which secured their spot at the upcoming tournament.

However, while a three-game ban would have seen him miss the first two group stage games at the World Cup, FIFA announced on Tuesday, just days after he met with President Donald Trump at the White House, that the remainder of his suspension “has been suspended,” with some suggesting this is down to his otherwise clean disciplinary record.

“The FIFA Disciplinary Committee has imposed a three-match ban on Cristiano Ronaldo following his direct red card at the FIFA World Cup 2026 preliminary competition match between the Republic of Ireland and Portugal played in Dublin on 13 November 2025. The first of the three matches was served in the encounter Portugal v. Armenia played on 16 November 2025,” the organization said in a statement.

“In line with article 27 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code, the serving of the two remaining matches has been suspended under a one-year probation period.

“If Cristiano Ronaldo commits another infringement of a similar nature and gravity during the probationary period, the suspension set out in the disciplinary decision shall be deemed automatically revoked and the remaining two matches must be served immediately at the next official match(es) of the Portuguese representative team.

“This is without prejudice to any additional sanctions imposed for the new infringement. The three-match suspension is subject to appeal to the FIFA Appeal Committee.”

Cristiano Ronaldo will be eligible to play in Portugal's opening match of the 2026 World Cup, assuming he makes the squad.

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner was sent off in a 2-0 loss to the Republic of Ireland on Nov. 13, which forced him to miss a 9-1 win over Armenia that sealed Portugal's qualification.

FIFA ruled the remainder of Ronaldo's three-match ban is suspended for a year, which clears his availability for the World Cup.

"If Cristiano Ronaldo commits another infringement of a similar nature and gravity during the probationary period, the suspension set out in the disciplinary decision shall be deemed automatically revoked and the remaining two matches must be served immediately," FIFA said, per BBC Sport.

At 40 years old, Ronaldo is clearly no longer at his peak on the pitch, and playing in the Saudi Pro League means he's not being challenged in the same way he would at a top club in Europe.

Portugal remains reliant on the legendary attacker, though.

Ronaldo scored five goals in five World Cup qualifying fixtures and had eight goals and one assist across nine matches in the Nations League last season.

One could question whether it's time for coach Roberto Martínez to pivot toward a younger forward line and a less heliocentric plan of attack. A longstanding criticism of Ronaldo in recent years is that he's offering less and less beyond his goalscoring,  and his massive profile makes it almost impossible to use him in a supporting role or as a super sub off the bench.

But de-emphasizing the Al-Nassr star would represent a major tactical change. He continues to be a regular starter for Portugal and play deep into matches.

For better or worse, Ronaldo will have a big say in how far the country advances in the 2026 World Cup. Missing him for the opening two matches would've been a tough blow for Martínez.

FIFA announced Tuesday the four pots that will be used to make the draw for the 2026 World Cup.

The 48 countries will be drawn into 12 groups of four, and the groups will have one team from each pot.

As the co-hosts, the trio Canada, Mexico and the United States are in Pot 1.

2026 World Cup Pots

Pot 1

Pot 2

Pot 3

Pot 4

The draw will unfold Dec. 5 in Washington, D.C., but the full World Cup field won't be finalized until mid-March.

Four spots are still up for grabs within the UEFA confederation. These are the four matchups to be decided on March 31:

The remaining confederations are competing in their own play-off:

In terms of the pots, Italy will be the one country everybody wants to avoid if the four-time champion qualifies. The Azzurri's issues are evident by the fact they fell into the play-off, but they're still ranked 12th in the world.

Getting Norway out of Pot 3 could be just as perilous. Erling Haaland is the best striker in the world, and the 4-1 demolition of Italy on Nov. 16 showed this is more than just a one-man team.

Increasing the field to 48 teams will remove some of the early danger in the group stage, though.

Under the 36-team format, only the top two in each group advanced to the knockout stages. Now, the eight best third-place finishers will get to move on as well.

Spain, Argentina, France, England will be the top seeds

Fifa introducing format it utilised at Club World Cup

The world's top four teams will not be able to meet until the semi-finals of next year's World Cup if they win their groups under a seeding system used by Fifa at the tournament for the first time.

It means England would benefit from tennis-style seeding and avoid Spain and Argentina until the semi-finals and France until the final if they win their group.

Fifa is introducing the system for the World Cup, having adopted a similar format for the Club World Cup this year.

The top two teams in the Fifa rankings – Spain and Argentina – will be on opposite draw pathways, as will the third- and fourth-ranked sides, France and England respectively.

Those four teams would then be placed in different quadrants of the 32-team knockout phase if they all come top of their groups.

The draw for the finals will take place in Washington DC on 5 December from 5pm GMT. England are among the top seeds, while Scotland are in pot three. England and Scotland could be drawn against each other, but that possibility will be removed if England draw a European opponent from pot two.

Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, US, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany.

Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, South Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia.

Pot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa.

Pot 4: Jordan, Cape Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, four European playoff teams, two intercontinental playoff teams.

A maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group. Teams from the other confederations must be kept apart.

World Cup

2026 World

Cup Countdown

On Tuesday, FIFA finalized seeding and procedures for the 2026 World Cup draw, including two new wrinkles with implications for the title favorites and co-hosts.

As it did for the 2025 Club World Cup, FIFA will separate the tournament into two “pathways” and ensure that the two top-ranked teams, Spain and Argentina, will go to opposite sides of the knockout round bracket — meaning they could not meet until the World Cup final if they win their respective groups.

FIFA has also pre-determined the positions that teams from each pot will occupy in each group — meaning the U.S., Canada and Mexico already know the order of their games. The U.S., for example, will open against a Pot 3 team, then play its second game against a Pot 2 team, and its group finale against a Pot 4 team.

The rest of the draw, however, will fall in line with precedent. All four pots will be seeded based on the FIFA rankings, with the six to-be-determined playoff winners — four from Europe, two from an inter-confederation playoff in March — all sent to Pot 4. (The other 42 of the 48 teams have already qualified.)

As usual, no two teams from the same confederation can share a group, with the exception of Europe, which will place one team in each group and a second team in four of the 12 groups.



The primary losers of FIFA's announcement are the European playoff teams, who will likely feel underseeded in Pot 4. Italy, ranked 12th in the world, would have been a Pot 2 team if it had qualified directly; instead, if Italy wins its playoff, it will essentially be seeded alongside 82nd-ranked Curaçao and 84th-ranked Haiti.

The draw will begin at noon ET (5pm GMT; 9am ET) next Friday, December 5, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.

Over the 24 hours or so after the draw concludes, FIFA will then determine and release the World Cup schedule, with each match assigned to a specific stadium and kickoff time.

Before 2018, pots were determined by geography. After the host(s), the defending champion and top-ranked teams were placed in Pot 1 (or Pot A), the rest were split up by confederation rather than ranking. This was FIFA's relatively simple mechanism to separate countries from the same region — or, in Europe's case, ensure that no more than two could be in the same group.

By 2018, though, an algorithm could do that. FIFA began seeding the entire draw, with the host and the best nations in Pot 1, the next-best teams in Pot 2, and the eight lowest-ranked in Pot 4.



By now, that seeding concept is ingrained and assumed. Ahead of 2026, the question was how to deal with six World Cup spots that remain unfilled. Four European playoffs and two inter-continental playoffs, to fill those final spots, will take place in March. FIFA officials, therefore, had multiple options: Should they place all six playoff teams in Pot 4? Or seed them, based on either an average ranking of the possible winners or the ranking of the best possible winner?

FIFA chose to keep them in Pot 4 to reward the 42 teams that have qualified directly. That decision, though, could make some groups significantly more difficult than others.

At previous World Cups, in addition to randomly drawing teams into groups, FIFA would randomly select a team's position within its group. Pot 1 teams always occupied Position 1, but when, say, Croatia is drawn from Pot 2, it could go into Position 2, 3 or 4 — which would, in turn, determine the sequence of its group games.

For the 2026 World Cup, instead, those positions have been pre-determined — in part to speed up the draw, in part to ensure a balanced distribution of matches throughout the group stage, a FIFA official said on a Zoom with reporters Tuesday.

This means that the U.S. men's national team now knows it will conclude group play against a Pot 4 team — potentially the weakest opponent in its group — on Thursday, June 25, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.

Mexico's national team will play its games in the same order:

Canada, on the other hand, will get its presumed weakest opponent first and its toughest opponent last:

At previous World Cups, there were no restrictions on knockout matchups. Even if there were two favorites head and shoulders above the rest of the field, they could meet in the round of 16 or quarterfinals.

In 2026, that won't happen — unless the favorites slip up and finish second or third in their respective groups.

FIFA's draw procedure will ensure that Spain and Argentina, the top two seeds, get placed in groups whose winners will go to opposite sides of the knockout bracket.

It will then put one of the teams ranked 3 and 4 — England and France — on one side of the bracket, and the other team on the other side. This means that England and France, should they win their groups, also could not meet until the final, and neither could meet Spain or Argentina until the semifinals.

These restrictions could confuse viewers, but will reward teams who've been dominant in World Cup qualifying and other recent tournaments — if they remain dominant through the World Cup group stage.

Cup Countdown

Cristiano Ronaldo has avoided a suspension for the start of next summer's World Cup after FIFA handed the Portugal captain a three-match ban, with the final two games suspended for “a one-year probation period”.

Ronaldo, 40, was sent off in Portugal's penultimate World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland on November 13 for swinging an elbow at defender Dara O'Shea in an off-the-ball incident.

He was initially shown a yellow card, but this was upgraded to a red after the video assistant referee (VAR) recommended a pitch-side review.

The red card meant Ronaldo would automatically serve a one-game ban, ruling him out of Portugal's final World Cup qualifier against Armenia, but the suspension was extended by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee, who deemed the offence worthy of a longer three-game ban.

However, the committee ruled that the final two matches of Ronaldo's extended ban would be suspended “under a one-year probation period”, meaning he will avoid missing any further fixtures provided he does not commit “another infringement of a similar nature”.

FIFA's regulations state that any suspensions in qualification matches would carry over to the final competition.

A FIFA statement to The Athletic read: “The FIFA Disciplinary Committee has imposed a three-match ban on Cristiano Ronaldo following his direct red card at the FIFA World Cup 2026 preliminary competition match between the Republic of Ireland and Portugal played in Dublin on 13 November 2025. The first of the three matches was served in the encounter Portugal v. Armenia played on 16 November 2025.

“In line with article 27 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code, the serving of the two remaining matches has been suspended under a one-year probation period.

“If Cristiano Ronaldo commits another infringement of a similar nature and gravity during the probationary period, the suspension set out in the disciplinary decision shall be deemed automatically revoked and the remaining two matches must be served immediately at the next official match(es) of the Portuguese representative team.

“This is without prejudice to any additional sanctions imposed for the new infringement. The three-match suspension is subject to appeal to the FIFA Appeal Committee.”

Ronaldo's sending off marked the first red card of his 226-game international career, and sources with knowledge of the situation indicated this disciplinary record at international level was a factor taken into consideration by the committee when determining the length of his suspension.

In FIFA's Disciplinary Code, Chapter 2, Article 14(i) states: “Players and officials shall be suspended for misconduct as specified below … at least three matches or an appropriate period of time for assault, including elbowing, punching, kicking, biting, spitting or hitting an opponent or a person other than a match official”.

Portugal head coach Roberto Martinez defended his captain following the sending off and described it as “harsh”.

“He's just a captain that has never been sent off before in 226 games, so I think that deserves credit,” Martinez said.

“Today, I think it was a bit harsh, because he cares about the team. He had 60 minutes being grabbed, being pulled, being pushed.

“Obviously when he tries to get away from the defender, the action looks worse than it actually is. I don't think it's the elbow, I think it's the full body. But from where the camera is, it looks like an elbow.”

Ronaldo has confirmed the 2026 World Cup is set to be his last and speaking in November, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said he expected to retire “soon”.

Last week, Ronaldo attended a black-tie dinner at the White House alongside U.S. President Donald Trump, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, FIFA president Gianni Infantino and dozens of billionaires and business leaders. Next summer's World Cup will be held in the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

Cristiano Ronaldo has scored a record 143 goals for Portugal

Cristiano Ronaldo will be able to play for Portugal in their opening game at next summer's World Cup finals despite his red card against the Republic of Ireland.

Ronaldo, 40, was sent off for an elbow to Dara O'Shea's back during Portugal's 2-0 qualifying defeat earlier this month. 

Violent conduct normally carries a three-match ban but Ronaldo has had the second and third matches suspended for a year.

BBC Sport understands that the fact it was his first red card in 226 international appearances was taken into account.

Ronaldo sat out the match against Armenia on 16 November so will not miss any games in the United States next summer.

A Fifa statement said: "If Cristiano Ronaldo commits another infringement of a similar nature and gravity during the probationary period, the suspension set out in the disciplinary decision shall be deemed automatically revoked and the remaining two matches must be served immediately."

Ronaldo scored five goals in qualifying as Portugal won Group F to reach their seventh straight World Cup.

The 48 teams will find out which group they are in at a draw shown live on the BBC on Friday, 5 December.

Cristiano Ronaldo is set to receive only a one-match ban for his red card against the Republic of Ireland in Portugal's penultimate World Cup qualifier. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner was sent off after elbowing Dara O'Shea off the ball and was set for a three-match ban for 'violent conduct'. However, FIFA's disciplinary committee has decided to let the 40-year-old off easy.

Ronaldo was expected to miss one or two of Portugal's opening clashes in the 2026 World Cup in North America after being shown a red card for violent conduct on O'Shea. However, FIFA's disciplinary committee have ruled that the Portugal captain's actions were only worth a one-game ban, which he has already served after he missed Roberto Martinez's squad for the 9-1 win over Armenia. His punishment, however, also holds a two-game suspended ban, which will be triggered if he is found guilty of a similar offence yet again in the next 365 days.

Ronaldo was sent off just before the hour mark, after Swedish referee Glenn Nyberg consulted with VAR, having shown the five-time Ballon d'Or winner a yellow card initially. In the review, it seemed clear to the referee that, in a tussle with O'Shea, Ronaldo clearly elbowed O'Shea in the back without any ball involvement around him.

The red card against the Republic of Ireland was Ronaldo's first of his international career as the Portugal captain has never been sent off in his 226 appearances with the national team. It has been reported that this disciplinary record may have played a massive part in the FIFA disciplinary committee's decision.

However, this wasn't the first time Ronaldo and O'Shea clashed as the Portugal captain and the Irishman had previously clashed, with the Al-Nassr star appearing to slap him all the way back in 2021. While O'Shea had hit the deck at that point as well, the referee and VAR had missed the incident, and Ronaldo had gotten away with his assault on the Ireland star; however, the same was not the case this time around.

Ronaldo's absence for Portugal's 9-1 win over Armenia raised serious questions from fans over the five-time Ballon d'Or winner's spot in Martinez's World Cup squad as Portugal's attacking play seemed a lot smoother. The same was the case during the 2022 World Cup when Fernando Santos played Ronaldo as more of a substitute through the tournament in Qatar with stars like Goncalo Ramos, Joao Felix and Diogo Jota starting instead.

However, the quarter-final failure against Morocco eventually saw Santos receive the sacking and Martinez being onboarded as the head coach of the Portuguese national team. The former Belgium coach quickly reintegrated the former Real Madrid man into the squad as he led Portugal to their Nations League triumph last year.

Nonetheless, questions are still being raised as to whether having Ronaldo as the main man in the Portugal squad is the best way forward for the 2026 World Cup as the country look to raise their first-ever trophy on the international stage.

Despite all the questions regarding Ronaldo's form at the highest level, it is highly unlikely that Martinez will be altering his squad this close to the World Cup. As such, it is almost guaranteed that Ronaldo will be the first name on the teamsheet when Portugal kickoff their 2026 World Cup campaign in North America.

However, the ill-tempered Ronaldo will have to keep his emotions in check through the tournament, as another sending off or even a violation of FIFA's regulations could see him miss the latter stages of the World Cup.

Cup Countdown



The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. will host the World Cup draw Kayla Bartkowski / Getty Images

FIFA's use of the Kennedy Center for next month's 2026 World Cup draw has become a source of controversy and Senate inquiry in the United States.

Soccer's global governing body's agreement with the Center is at the heart of a U.S. Senate committee probe into alleged “cronyism and corruption” at the Washington, D.C., performing arts venue; and of a critical letter sent last week by Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse to the Kennedy Center's president, Ric Grenell.

Advertisement

The letter cites the Center's contract with FIFA — which appears to grant FIFA exclusive use of the Center's Concert Hall and other spaces for a $0.00 rental fee, according to a copy obtained by Senate staff — as the foremost example of mismanagement by Grenell, who was installed by U.S. President Donald Trump.

“The Center,” Whitehouse wrote, “is being looted to the tune of millions of dollars in foregone revenue, cancelled programming, unpaid use of its facilities, and wasteful spending on luxury restaurants and hotels — an unprecedented pattern of self-dealing, favoritism, and waste.”

Grenell responded with a letter of his own and fiery posts on X, in which he disputed the notion that FIFA will use the Kennedy Center for free.

“FIFA has paid millions plus covered all expenses,” Grenell wrote.

A Center spokeswoman, Roma Daravi, told The Associated Press on Nov. 22 that FIFA is donating $2.4 million to the Center and “has also given us sponsorship opportunities separate from their commitments for an additional $5 million.”

Grenell and Kennedy Center officials did not provide written evidence of FIFA's payments, nor have they explained why FIFA is paying via donation and “sponsorship opportunities” rather than a rental fee.

Whitehouse — leader of the Democratic minority on the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee, which oversees buildings owned by the federal government — has asked Grenell to “explain the justification,” produce documents and answer a variety of questions by Dec. 4.

So, the Dec. 5 draw, which is essentially a World Cup kickoff event, looks set to take place against a contentious — and overtly political — backdrop.

The Kennedy Center was, for decades, an apolitical arts center that strived to showcase all types of American culture. But in February, the Trump administration ousted the Center's chairman, its president and Joe Biden-appointed board members. Its new board, stacked with Trump loyalists, chose Trump as the new chairman and Grenell, a career diplomat and Trump ally, as president.

Trump told reporters he “took over the Kennedy Center” because he “didn't like what they were showing. We're going to make sure that it's good and it's not going to be woke.” Over the nine months since, ticket sales have reportedly plummeted, but non-art events — such as the American Conservative Union Foundation's “Christian Persecution Summit” and a vigil for slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk — have come to the Center.

Next up is the World Cup Draw.

FIFA held World Cup draw negotiations with multiple venues in Las Vegas, people familiar with the discussions told The Athletic, but ultimately took the draw to the Kennedy Center at Trump's suggestion. Trump, after announcing the agreement in August, said: “We will lay out the red carpet.”

The agreement attracted attention when the Center's contract with FIFA leaked to The Washington Post earlier this month. The Post reported, and documents obtained by Senate staff suggest, that hosting FIFA on short notice has led to the rescheduling or cancellation of shows and has effectively cost the Center millions of dollars in relinquished rental fees.

This angered the arts community because, as Senator Whitehouse wrote, the Kennedy Center's “statutory mission is to present performing arts (including music, opera, drama, and dance) from the United States and abroad; promote itself as the National Center for the Performing Arts; ensure high-quality, diverse education and outreach programs; provide facilities for civic activities; and maintain a memorial to President [John F.] Kennedy. As a federally chartered 501(c)(3) nonprofit, the Center is funded by taxpayer dollars and private philanthropy.”

The FIFA contract and various other agreements, he wrote, “indicate that you have turned the Kennedy Center away from its mission.”

Grenell responded by saying the Senator's letter was “filled with partisan attacks and baseless accusations.” He wrote that the Kennedy Center's budget was balanced, and that “we have not cancelled shows.”

Defending the agreement with FIFA specifically, Grenell wrote: “Your focus on simple rental fees is no way to run an institution as diverse as the Kennedy Center. A simple rental fee would not have been enough to cover the magnitude of the event.”

The contract — apparently signed in August by 2026 World Cup chief strategy and planning officer Amy Hopfinger, FIFA World Cup chief operating officer Heimo Schirgi and Kennedy Center executive VP Rick Loughery — grants FIFA unfettered access to the Kennedy Center's Concert Hall from Nov. 24 through Dec. 12, the “exclusive use period.”

And it states: “FIFA 26 agrees to pay Venue the total of $0.00 (i.e., $0.00 per day) for use of the Facility.” It then reiterates: “Venue agrees to provide the Facilities to FIFA 26 free of any charges, for the exclusive use by FIFA 26 for the entire duration.”

FIFA, per the contract, is “responsible for operational costs associated with the delivery of the event including but not limited to production, promotion and catering.” FIFA is also responsible for security. The Kennedy Center, though, must “provide, at its own cost and expense, a sufficient but reasonable number of adequately qualified staff at each of the facilities,” plus utilities and other basic services.

It's unclear what separate agreements account for the “several million dollars” that Grenell has cited. Daravi told The AP that, in addition to expenses, “when you look at the full picture, it totals $7.4 million to the Kennedy Center.” Neither Grenell nor the Center's press office responded to emails from The Athletic seeking clarity on what Daravi meant by “sponsorship opportunities” and why FIFA would donate rather than paying a rental fee.

A FIFA spokesman declined to comment when asked if FIFA is sponsoring or intends to sponsor the Kennedy Center. He also declined to comment on why FIFA would sponsor a center that appears to have little relationship with soccer.

Former Kennedy Center officials, speaking to The Athletic over the past few days, were puzzled by the “donation” and “sponsorship opportunities” in lieu of a rental fee. Larry Wilker, the president from 1991-2000, said the Center never did a deal structured like that when he was in charge.

Independent tax and non-profit finance experts, in both Switzerland and the U.S., also told The Athletic they were unsure why the payment would be made as a donation rather than a rental fee — unless it were coming from a for-profit company, in which case donating, rather than paying for services, would allow for tax deduction.

It's unclear where, exactly, the payment would be coming from. FIFA is a Zurich-based nonprofit governed by Swiss law. It also owns various subsidiaries, including “FWC2026 US, Inc.,” the World Cup-focused entity registered as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit in the United States. The Kennedy Center is also a nonprofit funded by a mixture of earned revenue (from sources like ticket sales and rentals), private donations and government appropriations. The FIFA spokesman, when asked if FIFA owns any for-profit entities registered in the U.S., again declined to comment.

FIFA will stage the draw in the Concert Hall, the Kennedy Center's largest theatre. Per the contract, it could begin repurposing the 2,465-seat space on Monday, the first day of its exclusive use period. After a National Symphony Orchestra concert this past Sunday, there are no performances scheduled in the hall until Dec. 11.

FIFA will use the Eisenhower Theatre, the Kennedy Center's third-largest theatre, for overflow seating on the day of the draw. (The second-largest, the Opera House, is reserved for the annual Kennedy Center Honors two days later.)

FIFA has also booked the Terrace Theatre and three galleries for team seminars, the Reach Plaza for its broadcast compound, and several studios, classrooms and pavilions for a media center, according to the contract. There will also be a “green carpet” arrival area and a “legends lounge.” In the days surrounding Dec. 5, there will be a “VVIP dinner” in the Roof Terrace Restaurant; a night-before reception in the 630-foot-long Grand Foyer and other areas; and another reception in the Grand Foyer after the draw.

Whitehouse, in the letter published Thursday, asked Grenell: “What was the process and justification for the Kennedy Center's agreement with FIFA?”

He then demanded “internal cost estimates, scheduling impacts, and any Board discussions or approvals related to zero-dollar use of the Kennedy Center campus.”

And finally, after asking how this arrangement is “consistent with the Center's statutory mission,” he told Grenell to “please explain” whether FIFA's creation of a “Peace Prize” — and speculation that Infantino will give it to Trump on the day of the draw — “factored into discussions or decisions regarding the Kennedy Center's partnership with FIFA.”

The relationship between Infantino and Trump has been warm for many years now. The pair got to know each other during Trump's first term, when Canada, Mexico and the U.S. were bidding to host the 2026 World Cup and White House support was required.

In early 2020, while introducing Trump to a dinner of CEOs in the Swiss ski resort Davos, Infantino hailed Trump as a “sportsman” and competitor. The pair maintained contact during Trump's period out of office, and the FIFA president was invited to Trump's second inauguration this past January.

In the week leading up to the inauguration, Infantino posted about Trump nine times on Instagram and wore a red tie when attending Trump's pre-inauguration rally. Trump had sent a video message of support which was played during the Club World Cup draw in Miami last December, with his daughter Ivanka and grandson Theo invited to make the ceremonial first pick. Since then, Infantino has appeared in the Oval Office more than any foreign nation's head of state.

A White House task force, chaired by Trump, was established to oversee federal planning for the World Cup. FIFA has also taken office space in Trump Tower in New York City, while Trump took part in the trophy celebrations when Chelsea won the Club World Cup in July at MetLife Stadium.

Recently, Infantino has publicly defended Trump's performance as U.S. president. At the America Business Forum in Miami this month, Infantino praised him as a man who “says what many people think” and said he could not understand “negative comments.”

That same day, FIFA announced that it would award an inaugural “Peace Prize” at the World Cup draw. It did not say, even when asked, who had decided to create the award or how a winner would be selected. When Infantino, speaking at the Miami event a few hours after Trump, was asked if the winner had spoken on the same stage earlier in the day, he laughed and said: “Well, on the 5th of December, you will see.”

Italy are expected to host Northern Ireland in Bergamo for the World Cup play-off semifinal in March 2026, as Atalanta's New Balance Arena has its stands close to the pitch and already provided a warm welcome on Gennaro Gattuso's debut in September.

FIGC President Gabriele Gravina confirmed last week that Italy will likely host the World Cup play-off semifinal against Northern Ireland at the New Balance Arena in Bergamo, home to Serie A side Atalanta.

The Azzurri will play on March 26, 2026, and if they progress to the Final, they'll visit Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina on March 31.

Wales have chosen the Cardiff City Stadium for their World Cup play-off games, while Bosnia will play the possible Final at the Bilino Polje in Zenica.

As reported by Repubblica, Gattuso and the federation were delighted by the welcome received in Bergamo on September 5, when the coach made his debut as La Nazionale's boss, beating Estonia 5-0.

Nearly 23,000 fans attended the game and made their support felt, also thanks to the stands close to the pitch. Italy hope fans in Bergamo can produce the same next year, as the Azzurri will need full support from the home crowd in a vital match.

According to Repubblica, if Italy had played the Final at home, Udine, Rome and Turin (Allianz Stadium) would have been the favourites to host the two Italy games, but with just one play-off tie played domestically, the Bergamo option was predominant and is expected to be confirmed in the coming days.

FUKUSHIMA, Japan (November 25, 2025) – The U.S. Women's Deaf National Team used a brace from Emily Spreeman as well as goals from Holly Hunter and Erin Cembrale to earn a 4-0 win against hosts Japan in the Final of the Women's Football Competition at the 2025 Deaflympics. The match was the last in the illustrious international careers of Spreeman and fellow veterans Sydney Andrews and Kate Ward, as well as the final game managed by head coach Amy Griffin and assistant Joy Fawcett as the Deaf WNT claimed a record fifth Deaflympics gold medal and eighth overall world championship title since beginning play in 2005.

The U.S. took a few minutes to settle into the match, but eventually came out blazing with four chances in as many minutes. In the ninth, Cembrale ran onto a loose ball and fired a rocket that Kasumi Kunishima pushed over the bar for a corner. A minute later, Paris Price's cross from the left found Tia LaBrecque whose first-time effort clanged off the bar. In the 11th minute, a failed clearance fell to Cembrale at the top of the area, where she curled a shot from the left side of the box off the crossbar again. In the 12th minute, Mia White was slotted through on goal, but her powerful shot from the right was turned away by Kunishima.

After a frustrating period of chances and a few good Japan attacks, the U.S. finally broke through on the half-hour mark. Spreeman fed White in down the right, where she hopped a defender before getting to the endline and crossing to Hunter at the near post. The midfielder's initial header was saved, but she was there to bang home the rebound inside the right post to give the USA a 1-0 lead.

A second nearly came in first-half stoppage time as Ani Khachadourian broke down the right and crossed looking for Cembrale in the box, but Japan's Kanon Masuda was there to clear the danger and keep the U.S. lead to one goal at halftime.

The second goal did come three minutes into the second half. A nice build-up out of the back led to White getting on the ball, taking a touch and slotting Spreeman through the Japan backline. The USA striker sped forward before slotting home the 49th goal of her international career to make it 2-0.

Sitting one away from 50 goals in her final international match, Spreeman wasn't quite ready to hang up her scoring boots. In the 65th minute, a progressive build-up through midfield led to White holding the ball before playing Gracie Fitzgerald in on the right. The veteran defender placed a picture-perfect cross into the box, finding Spreeman who nodded home her second of the match to hit the half century mark.

Cembrale joined the scoring club in the 74th minute. Continuing to prove dangerous, White got on the end of a cross that she clanged off the crossbar from the six. The ball was cleared out of the box, but collected by Cembrale who looped a beautiful effort into the top left corner to make it 4-0.

Starting the match on the bench, Ward replaced White in the 79th minute to earn her team-record 35th international appearance. The veteran midfielder helped the U.S. keep its fourth clean sheet in as many matches at the Deaflympics, finishing the game on-field with fellow retirees Andrews and Spreeman.

AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan looks set to leave the club at the end of the season as a free agent, with no new contract talks scheduled with the Serie A side. Juventus are closely monitoring the situation and are interested in bringing the Frenchman to Turin, while several Premier League clubs, including Chelsea, are also considering a move for the highly-rated keeper.

With his contract expiring at the end of the season, Maignan can begin negotiating with other clubs as early as January, raising the possibility of leaving Milan on a free transfer. Milan had reportedly offered an extension until 2028, increasing his salary from €2.8 million to €5.5m per year, but he has not been convinced to sign on the dotted line with Calciomercato reporting that no further talks are scheduled between the goalkeeper and club. Juventus have emerged as serious contenders for his signature, hoping to capitalise on the uncertainty and secure one of Europe's top goalkeepers without a transfer fee.

Premier League clubs have also shown strong interest in Maignan, who has been a key player at Milan since he joined from Lille in 2021, with Chelsea emerging as the most serious contender. The London club are actively searching for a long-term replacement for Robert Sanchez and view Maignan as an ideal fit. Chelsea attempted to sign him in June but failed to reach an agreement with Milan. In fact, they were close to finalising a deal this summer before Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri intervened to block the transfer, partly influenced by the club's ongoing efforts to sign Strasbourg right-back Guela Doue.

Chelsea's chances may now improve, especially as Juventus' renewed interest in the 30-year-old comes at a difficult moment for the Italian side. UEFA has opened fresh proceedings into alleged financial irregularities between 2022 and 2025, raising the risk of further sanctions. This could weaken Juventus' ability to compete financially for a top signing.

With Maignan able to begin talks in January and Milan hesitant over his renewal due to concerns about his long-term fitness, the transfer race is increasingly favouring Premier League bidders - particularly Chelsea, who remain determined to bring him to Stamford Bridge.

The France international made an immediate impact at San Siro after replacing Gianluigi Donnarumma, helping the Rossoneri to the Scudetto in the 2021-22 season while recording the most clean sheets in Serie A. His shot-stopping, leadership and calm presence quickly made him one of the league's standout goalkeepers. However, the following two seasons were disrupted by injuries that affected his consistency and availability, leading to concerns within the club about his long-term reliability. Despite those setbacks, Maignan has returned strongly in the current campaign. He has kept four clean sheets in the league and delivered decisive moments in big matches, including saving penalties from Paulo Dybala and Hakan Calhanoglu in crucial wins over Roma and Inter, respectively. His resurgence has re-established him as a key figure for Milan while also attracting interest from major European clubs.

Milan have reignited their Serie A title hopes under Allegri, highlighted by Sunday's derby win over Inter thanks to a goal from Christian Pulisic. With no European commitments this season, Milan are serious title contenders, and the allure of silverware could be used to persuade Maignan to extend his contract. Juventus remain interested, viewing Maignan's European experience as a valuable asset to rotate with Michele De Gregorio. Meanwhile, Chelsea are expected to reopen talks with his entourage, recalling their previous agreement with the goalkeeper. Enzo Maresca could push for the move, seeing Maignan as a potential final piece to strengthen Chelsea's title ambitions. Maignan's decision will be pivotal for Milan, with clubs across Europe keen to secure one of the continent's top goalkeepers.

Losing Robert Lewandowski to Barcelona in the summer of 2022 was a bitter blow for Bayern Munich. The Pole had scored 344 goals in just 375 appearances for the club, after all. Replacing him was never going to be easy, but it ended up taking Bayern more than a year to find a worthy successor, as Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting rather unsurprisingly didn't exactly prove himself up to the task.

It's funny to think about it now, but there were those that questioned the decision to sign Harry Kane to belatedly fill the considerable hole left by Lewandowski in the Bayern attack. Club legend Lothar Matthaus felt that the €100 million signing from Tottenham, who had just turned 30, was "too old and too expensive". Now, though, the German says he doesn't "see a better striker in the world".

It, therefore, shouldn't come as that much of a shock to learn that Barcelona have come to the same conclusion as Bayern two years ago: that there isn't a better Lewandowski replacement on the market right now than Kane.

Back in 2023, it was rumoured that part of the reason why Lewandowski wanted out of the Allianz Arena was Bayern's alleged attempt to convince Erling Haaland to move to Munich rather than Manchester that same summer. Lewandowski insisted that Norwegian No.9 had absolutely nothing to do with his desire to swap Bavaria for Barcelona, but it's nonetheless amusing to read reports that Blaugrana president Joan Laporta is 'obsessed' with signing Haaland.

It's obviously not going to happen - at least not yet. It's going to take at least another year for lever-pulling Laporta to balance the Blaugrana's books - let alone put them back in a position to sign the most valuable players on the planet. With a little more creative accounting, though, Barca could well be in a position to land Kane at the end of the season.

According to Bild, the England captain has a €65m (£57m/$76m) buyout clause in his contract that can be activated next summer provided the striker notifies Bayern of his desire to leave by the end of January. The Bundesliga champions are, however, reportedly relaxed about the situation for the simple fact that Kane is currently content, on and off the field at the Allianz Arena.

From a purely sporting perspective, things certainly couldn't be going any better for Kane and his club. Unbeaten Bayern have made a record-breaking start to their 2025-26 campaign and are presently top of both the Bundesliga and the Champions League. Kane is the principal reason why, having scored an utterly ludicrous 24 goals in just 18 appearances in all competitions - more than any other player in Europe's 'Big Five' leagues.

The man himself may have had understandable misgivings about the size of Vincent Kompany's squad at the start of the season - but they've made light of the absence of Jamal Musiala through injury thanks to the exciting emergence of 17-year-old sensation Lennart Karl, Luis Diaz's incredible impact since joining from Liverpool and Michael Olise elevating his game to an even higher level after a wonderful debut season in Germany.

The net result is that Bayern are the best team in Europe at the moment - as they underlined by maintaining their 100 percent in the Champions League with a mightily impressive 2-1 victory over titleholders Paris Saint-Germain at Parc des Princes during which they showcased both their attacking prowess and defensive diligence.

Crucially, Kane's family are also loving life right now - and not just because he's enjoying the most prolific spell of his stellar career.

When he first made the move from his native London to Munich, there were external concerns over how Kane and his family would deal with the change of city, country and culture. However, Kane has repeatedly brought up just how "comfortable" he, his wife Kate and their children feel in Germany, where they are reportedly afforded more privacy than they were back in England.

"The way the people here welcomed us was extraordinary," the striker said earlier this year. "It touched us deeply as a family - not just me, but all of us. We love it. We truly appreciate every second."

In that context, one cannot but take Kane at his word when he says that he's even open to extending a contract that expires in 2027.

"We can certainly talk about that," he said in September. "I have almost two years left, so it's not like I'm in the final year of my contract and anyone is panicking. I'm fine. The club is fine. I think they're happy with me, and I'm happy with them. Those discussions can take place."

He doubled down on that when directly questioned about the Barcelona links ahead of his return to north London with Bayern on Wednesday when they face Arsenal in the Champions League, telling BILD: "I haven't had any contact with anyone, nobody has contacted me. I feel very comfortable in the current situation, even though we haven't yet discussed my situation with Bayern. There's no rush. I'm really happy in Munich. You can see that in the way I'm playing. If there's contact, then we'll see. But I'm not thinking about the new season yet. First up is the World Cup in the summer. And it's very unlikely that anything will change after this season."

There's no denying, though, that Kane would give serious consideration to a serious bid from Barca, who, for all of their financial troubles, retain an almost mythical status even among elite-level footballers. There are few more attractive destinations on the planet, and what No.9 wouldn't want to play in the same forward line as Lamine Yamal? All things considered, Kane would find an offer from Barca very difficult to turn down, particularly if they resolve their registration problems in 2026.

It's also clear that the Blaugrana are going to have to replace Lewandowski sooner rather than later. The Poland international is still scoring goals - no Barca player has scored more in La Liga this season (eight) - but he's 37 now and he's had three muscular issues since April, suggesting that his body is starting to betray him.

It certainly feels significant that talks have yet to begin over a new deal for Lewandowski, who will be out of contract at the end of the current campaign and free to talk to other clubs from January 1.

When asked about his next move while on Poland duty last week, Lewandowski admitted to reporters, "I still don't know the answer. That's why I'm not in a hurry. I'm at peace with myself, and that is the most important thing. Even if, for example, the club contacted me now, I still wouldn't answer that question, because I also have to feel what's best for me. But, for now, I'm calm, I'm not in a hurry and, at the moment, I don't expect anything else."

Tellingly, Barcelona have been linked with several strikers in recent weeks, including Julian Alvarez, Victor Osimhen, Serhou Guirassy and Etta Eyong - but the common consensus is that Kane is top of the transfer target shortlist. 

On the face of it, that's surprising, given Kane will turn 33 before the start of next season. However, there's absolutely nothing to suggest that time is catching up with him. Kane has always spoken of his desire to emulate iconic duo Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi by playing into his late-30s and fellow England legend Wayne Rooney has even compared his relentless pursuit of goals to that of the Portuguese. However, whereas Ronaldo finetuned his game as he got older, Kane's is actually evolving. 

"What Harry has produced here in the last year or two is absolutely top-notch," acknowledged Bayern's honorary president Uli Hoeness. "And what I like best about him is that, in the beginning, he was a goal-scorer who played in his box, who waited for the balls to come. But, today, he's long since become a playmaker, as well as a finisher. Above all else, though, he's a player with a personality who inspires others on the pitch, who sets the direction, and that's exactly what we were looking for."

Basically, Bayern wanted a Lewandowski replacement - but they got so much more. 

"Robert Lewandowski won the Champions League with Bayern in 2020 and was later named World Player of the Year, but the two aren't comparable," Matthaus wrote in his column for Sky Germany. "Kane reinvented the centre-forward game, just as Manuel Neuer did with goalkeepers about a decade and a half ago.

"I don't see a better striker in the world right now - and not just because of his goals, but because of his versatility and the positions he plays. Kane also demonstrates qualities as a passer, dribbler, and tackler. He is simultaneously a goal-scorer, playmaker, box-to-box player, and tackler. 

"I've never seen Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe slide in their own penalty area like Kane did in the 88th minute against Dortmund (on October 18). I also don't see Haaland and Mbappe make passes of 50 metres or more. I haven't seen the chip shots that Kane can play from the other two.I just think Kane has become even better because he can act as a free spirit."

Of course, the flip side of Kane's consistently world-class displays for Bayern is that he's now in complete control of his own destiny. He can pretty much do whatever he desires at this particular point in his career.

If the all-time Premier League goals record is truly of the utmost importance to him, he can return to England and hunt down Alan Shearer's tally (260) with his beloved Tottenham - or maybe even Manchester United, who repeatedly tried to sign him in the past and are still crying out for a prolific centre-forward.

Of course, Kane could also conclude that the best way to prolong his career at the highest level would be to stay at Bayern, as the Bundesliga is not as physically punishing as the Premier League. The Bavarians can also virtually guarantee more trophies and annual qualification for the Champions League - a competition that the 32-year-old remains desperate to win.

But if Barca do come calling, Kane would likely listen to what they have to say. Whether they'll really be in a position to make any financial guarantees by the end of January is obviously very much open to debate.

What we do know, though, is that if Kane were to go to Camp Nou, it would be an even bigger blow for Bayern than losing Lewandowski - and Matthaus isn't the only one that would have found that remarkable two years ago.

Malik Tillman and Christian Pulisic celebrate their goals from the weekend Sebastian El-Saqqa/Alessio Morgese/Getty Images

They missed the chance to bask in the glow of the United States' encouraging wins during the break, but some of the men's national team's most experienced stars were on form during the weekend as domestic action resumed in Europe, with an emphatic response after Mauricio Pochettino doubled down on the notion that there's no such thing as “regulars” with a World Cup around the corner.

Welcome to the latest USMNT Player Tracker.

Wherever Massimiliano Allegri deploys Christian Pulisic, the results seem to be the same.

Whether it's on either flank, in an attacking central berth or even up front as part of a strike duo, the USMNT star delivers.

On Sunday, pairing Rafael Leao in a front two for Milan, Pulisic scored the only goal of an important derby win against city rivals Inter.

His strike showed the rest of Serie A that Milan, at their full-intensity best, can be in the Serie A title mix. Pulisic tops the scoring charts in Italy's top flight (five goals, level with Inter's Hakan Calhanoglu and Bologna's Riccardo Orsolini) and is approaching full fitness after missing four Milan games with a hamstring injury.



That setback also caused the 27-year-old to sit out the latest round of USMNT fixtures, missing out on the buzz of impressive wins over Paraguay and Uruguay. After returning from the bench for Milan in the 2-2 draw against Parma at the start of the month, he started at the San Siro yesterday and made all the difference.

Allegri first tried Pulisic as a striker in a competitive fixture in Milan's season-opening 2-1 defeat against Cremonese but, after testing out the idea of two false nines during pre-season, the Milan coach hinted it may happen again.

“It worked well, but it had already worked in Australia,” Allegri told DAZN after the 1-0 win over Inter. “Christopher Nkunku is also important — we need everyone. Training together this week is an advantage because it increases the pace.”

Determined to avoid any hint of complacency, Allegri also highlighted Milan's missed opportunities this term, times when he feels his side have lacked the right approach.

But Pulisic, who has another firebrand as his international coach in Pochettino, views the high standards as a big inspiration.

”We see a coach who wants to win,” Pulisic told DAZN. “You want to play for a guy who you would run through a wall for. It gives us energy.”

After a brief recharge, Pulisic seems energised. It should bode well for club and country.

For the USMNT players who were not on international duty during the break, it was a weekend to remind everyone of their quality.

Malik Tillman saw his older brother, Timothy, get two appearances for the USMNT in Philadelphia and Tampa, while he rested back in Germany.

But on Saturday, Malik Tillman scored as Bayer Leverkusen secured a 3-1 victory away at Wolfsburg that nudged them into third place in the table ahead of Borussia Dortmund.

The display continued a return to form for Tillman. After his summer move from PSV to Leverkusen, he took time to achieve lift-off, with his transition not helped when the manager who signed him, Erik ten Hag, was swiftly sacked.

Missing games through injury has been another disruptive factor, but the undoubted ability that led to his €35million ($40m; £30m) transfer was evident at the weekend.

Back in the XI after starting on the bench for the previous 6-0 win against Heidenheim, Tillman, 23, did not let the opportunity pass him by.

He ticked off a statistical milestone, too, with Opta pointing out that he became the first United States international to record a goal and an assist in a Bundesliga match since Jordan Pefok for Union Berlin back in August 2022.

Twenty-four hours earlier, Tim Weah had set the tone. Another who sat out the international break, the Marseille forward also scored in a big win.

His side thrashed Nice 5-1, and Weah's thunderous strike was one of the best goals as Marseille temporarily went top of France's Ligue 1.

It was his first league goal for the club since joining the side that his father also played for in the summer.

It wasn't all abundant positives for Americans.

Gio Reyna's international break underlined what he can do, with the 23-year-old scoring against Paraguay, then assisting in last week's 5-1 win over Uruguay.

But Reyna had to accept being back among the substitutes for Borussia Monchengladbach at the weekend. He was introduced with 18 minutes remaining of the 3-0 win against Heidenheim.

Reyna has only started one league game for the Bundesliga club he joined during the summer, after his once-promising career at Dortmund went stale.

It seems he must continue to bide his time and convince Gladbach head coach Eugen Polanski he is ready to be a regular first-team player. No such problem for his compatriot Joe Scally, who was starting his ninth league game of the season and played the full match.

In the Premier League, Chris Richards was back in one of the English top flight's best defences as Crystal Palace won again, beating Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-0.

But he had to be replaced after 83 minutes with what manager Oliver Glasner later attributed to muscle cramp.

They were the first Premier League minutes Richards has missed for his club all season, and Palace fans will hope it was a one-off.

It's Champions League time and Malik Tillman will get a tough test of his fine form as Leverkusen take on Manchester City tomorrow (3pm, Paramount+/DAZN).

It will be an interesting game for Sergino Dest and Ricardo Pepi, too, as PSV head to Anfield to face a badly struggling Liverpool the following day (Wednesday, 3pm, Paramount+/ViX).

In the Conference League, we might see if Richards has recovered when Crystal Palace take on Strasbourg (Thursday, 3pm, Paramount+/ViX). Earlier the same day, Auston Trusty and Celtic play Feyenoord in the Europa League (12:45pm, Paramount+/ViX).

Then, on the weekend, Tyler Adams and Bournemouth travel to Sunderland (Saturday, 10am, Peacock Premium).

MVP and Olympic champion Rose Lavelle led the celebrations for the two-time NWSL champions in New York City, USA, on Monday night.

Gotham FC celebrated their second NWSL Championship victory with a celebratory parade in New York City, USA, on Monday (24 November).

Team USA's Olympic football champion Rose Lavelle scored the only goal of the game in a 1-0 win against the Washington Spirit, marking the third national title for the New York/New Jersey-based team. 

Each player was presented with a ceremonial key to the city of New York by Mayor Eric Adams, as open-bus celebrations led the squad through the city's streets and to City Hall.

“To win a championship, it literally takes every last person,” said Final MVP Lavelle at the ceremony. “I think the commitment that this club and everybody within it has taken just to get one per cent better every single day is the reason why we're up here right now getting to celebrate this.”

This is the third time that the North American elite women's football championship title has returned to New York City, following the team's maiden NWSL triumph in 2023 against OL Reign (now known as Seattle Reign FC). Their first top level title came in 2009, when the team was known as Sky Blue FC and the competition was Women's Professional Soccer (WPS).

New York also marked Gotham FC's triumph by lighting up the Empire State Building in the team's black-and-blue colours on Monday night.

Led by two-time NWSL champion coach Juan Carlos Amorós, Gotham FC have a host of talent among their ranks. Lavelle is one of four USA Olympic gold medallists, alongside Jaedyn Shaw, Emily Sonnett, and Tierna Davidson.

The U.S. players were given a special welcome to their national team camp the same day, as Emma Hayes' USA host Italy in a double header in Florida on Friday (28 November) and next Monday (1 December).

The newly crowned U.S. league winners also feature Paris 2024 bronze medallist Ann-Katrin Berger of Germany, FIFA World Cup winner with Spain Esther González, and England's two-time European champion Jess Carter.

UEFA is facing separate legal battles worth a total of €4.5 billion as Real Madrid and A22, the company behind the European Super League, are suing the governing body in the wake of a court ruling. A22 have also sent a letter to UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin, demanding the controversial project be given full approval.

According to AS, the European Super League's organisers and Madrid are launching separate lawsuits against UEFA, arguing that the organisation's actions caused substantial financial harm to the divisive project. Attempts to block the competition, which aims to challenge the Champions League by pitting the continent's strongest teams against each other, were dashed when the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) determined in 2023 that UEFA and FIFA acted unlawfully by blocking the creation of the Super League. Then, in October, the Provincial Court of Madrid dismissed appeals lodged by UEFA, La Liga, and the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), upholding the earlier judgment. 

In a new letter to UEFA, A22 warned of legal consequences should they refuse to adhere to that ruling and grant official approval within two months. 

"Despite our substantial concessions, no agreement has been reached," it read. "Consequently, we hereby reiterate our request for UEFA's formal acknowledgement of our proposal (amended to reflect the negotiations mentioned above) as soon as possible and, in any event, no later than eight weeks from the date of this letter."

Meanwhile, Madrid president Florentino Perez confirmed at the Annual General Meeting that the club will file their own lawsuit, which will take the entire claims against UEFA to €4.5bn.

The Super League was originally launched with 12 founding clubs as a closed competition, immediately sparking backlash across Europe. Following intense criticism and negotiations with UEFA, the organisers introduced several major reforms to reshape the project into a more open and competitive model. The revised format proposed expanding the competition to 36 clubs, divided into two groups of 18 in a “Super-Champions” style league, with the top teams advancing to the knockout stages. Governance reforms were also put forward, including a new board composed of participating clubs, UEFA or the European Football Council, and player representatives. Significantly, three player delegates would have voting power on crucial matters such as revenue distribution and competition format. A22 additionally suggested creating a unified digital platform called 'Unify' to stream free football content to fans worldwide. 

Despite these amendments, UEFA ultimately rejected the proposals, sparking further action from Madrid and A22.

The Super League project, launched in 2021 by giants such as Madrid, Barcelona, Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea, collapsed almost immediately under massive fan protests and strong pressure from football authorities. The English clubs withdrew within days, leaving Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus as the project's remaining supporters. Over time, however, Juventus and Barcelona's stances shifted. With UEFA introducing a new Champions League format that promises higher revenues, improved competitiveness and several structural adjustments, the Italian side pulled out in June 2024, three years before the other teams withdrew, and Barcelona followed in October this year. The Catalan side's exit leaves their Clasico rivals as the last remaining team still publicly advocating for the Super League.

UEFA will look to find common ground with A22 and Madrid before granting official recognition to the revamped Super League. Fans will hope that a solution emerges that serves the broader interests of football. Meanwhile, Madrid are set to host Olympiacos in the Champions League on Wednesday, with Los Blancos aiming to return to winning ways after suffering a loss and two draws in recent games against Liverpool, Rayo Vallecano and Elche.

The talent Chelsea possess in their first team squad means that they are going to be seeing a large number of their players in action at the 2026 World Cup.

After Enzo Maresca led his side to Club World Cup glory last summer, there will be some Chelsea players going up against each other this time around, with elimination potentially on the line.

Cole Palmer and Moises Caicedo could meet in the group stages after it was determined that Ecuador would be in Pot Two for the World Cup.

There are some individuals who are on the cusp of making it with their nation just in time. Thomas Tuchel is set to talk to Liam Delap about what he needs to do to make it into the England squad.

Another striker who is on the brink is Emanuel Emegha, who is set to move to Chelsea at the end of the season from Strasbourg.

He was named in the Netherlands squad in the most recent international break, ahead of Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee.

After a rough run this season at Old Trafford, he was handed a start last night, however missed a plethora of chances and failed to impress in their 1-0 defeat against 10 men.

Zirkzee is going to need to put in some serious performances to earn his place back in the side, although while he is not the chances will only continue to improve for Emegha.

Emegha came off the bench in both of Netherlands' fixtures during the last international break, the first time he had done so in his career.

Dutch media praised Emegha for his performance on debut, however he missed a number of big chances in his second showing.

Injuries have disrupted his start to the 2025/26 campaign. He has only managed six Ligue 1 appearances, scoring four goals in that time.

Fans of the French side are not keen on him for jumping ship to the BlueCo partner club, but while he has the backing of Liam Rosenior he is set to continue earning minutes until he departs.

Serena Williams delights fans by sharing her love for tennis with 2-year-old daughter Adira, seen mimicking her mom's moves on the court. This isn't their first adorable tennis moment, and Williams has also involved her older daughter Olympia in the sport -- though she says she'd never pressure either to play if she didn't want to.

This doubles team is hitting all the right shots! Serena Williams had social media swooning on Monday when she posted photos of herself "sharing her passion" for tennis with her 2-year-old daughter, Adira.

In photos posted to Williams' Instagram account, the former world No. 1 is seen on a backyard tennis court with the younger of her two children.

The toddler can seen balancing a ball on her racquet while mimicking her mom's forehand -- and the Internet couldn't get enough of the sweet scene.

But this isn't the first time that the all-time great and Adira have shared a cute moment on the tennis court. Back in July, Williams posted another candid snapshot of the two between the white lines.

Balancing Adira on her hip, Williams stood in the classic trophy pose, as if serving -- and joked that she never thought she'd "have to carry [her] doubles partner."

The 23-time Grand Slam singles champion welcomed Adira in August of 2023 -- a year after she played her last professional match at the 2022 US Open. The 44-year-old also shares daughter Olympia, 8, with husband, Reddit co-founder and entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian -- and tennis has been, fittingly, a family affair. Williams signed her elder daughter up for lessons back in 2020, owing to tennis' status as a safe, socially-distant sport during the COVID-19 pandemic, and said at the time that the coach had "no idea" that she was her daughter.

Two years ago, she confessed that Olympia "doesn't actually like to play tennis too much," even if she did show natural talent from an early age.

"That's a little disappointing for me, but she's actually really good at it. So we are trying to figure out a way to get her to play a little bit," she said. 

But maybe the key lies in making it a sister act? After all, Williams would know a thing or two about that.

"If your daughters play tennis it would be epic," wrote one Instagram user in the comments of her latest post, while another predicted that little Adira would be the 2040 US Open champion.

Tennis' biggest stars didn't just let their racquets do the talking in 2025. To look back on a memorable season, we're counting down some of the biggest winners in the press conference room and on the microphone—and we're beginning with the heartwarming message from Daniil Medvedev at the Almaty Open that hit us right in the feels.Medvedev's title-winning run in Kazakhstan in October was meaningful in more ways than one. The former world No. 1 captured his first title in more than two years at the ATP 250 event thanks to two titantic efforts against James Duckworth and Corentin Moutet in the final two rounds, breaking an 882-day title drought with his 21st career title in a 21st different city.But the emotional scene after the final ball was struck topped any statistical achievement for the 29-year-old. Playing in front of his family, Medvedev shared a sweet moment with them courtside before dedicating the victory to his second daughter, Victoria, who was born at the start of the year.

I want to thank my family, my beautiful wife, and my two daughters. It is the first time I have been at a tournament with my two daughters and wife together, so to get a title is really nice.I honor this title to my second daughter Victoria, because the first title I got when my first daughter Alisa was born was for her, so this one is for Victoria. Daniil Medvedev

Medvedev, his wife Daria, and their girls proceeded to pose for what may have been the cutest photo shoot of the year as baby Victoria and 3-year-old Alisa (who celebrated her birthday with a party during the tournament) were enthralled both by dad's new hardware, and traditional Kazakh chapan, a robe the symbolizes honor, respect and hospitality.See the photos: Daniil Medvedev celebrates Almaty Open triumph with familyBut the win in Almaty and family memories that followed was a watershed point for Medvedev in 2025. He won just one match combined at the four Grand Slam tournaments, ended the year at No. 13 (his lowest ranking since 2018), and split with longtime coach Gilles Cervara after a first-round loss to Bejamin Bonzi at the US Open. Shortly after, he linked up with former Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke as new coaches, who helped guide him to glory in Almaty."I'm 29 years old, almost 30 soon, and [I wanted] to try something new in my adult career," he said during the Rolex Shanghai Masters.“You look for different things when you're 20 and when you're 30,” Medvedev added, speaking exclusively with ATPTour.com. “Because when you're 20, you're still a young tennis player so you probably need someone to show you the way. When you are 30, you need someone not to show you the way, but to help you find the way again.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Title fight reignites in Las Vegas

2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Find out who topped the Power Rankings table after the Las Vegas Grand Prix weekend.

Max Verstappen took a crucial win in the Las Vegas Grand Prix, and with both McLaren drivers disqualified, slashed Lando Norris' championship lead to just 24 points. The Dutchman topped the top 10 of our Power Rankings list, but who else impressed last weekend? Check out the latest scores and overall leaderboard below...

Having overtaken poleman Lando Norris when the McLaren driver ran wide at Turn 1, Max Verstappen never looked back en route to his sixth win of the 2025 campaign. The Red Bull driver briefly had to soak up pressure from George Russell's Mercedes, but thereafter cruised to a 20-second-plus win. With Norris and team mate Oscar Piastri both disqualified, Verstappen remains a real threat for the title with two Grands Prix and a Sprint remaining, as the Dutchman sits tied on points with Piastri and just 24 behind Norris.

A disastrous Qualifying left Kimi Antonelli only P17 on the grid as moving fractionally before the lights went out then earned the Mercedes driver a five-second penalty. Despite that, the Formula 1 rookie put in an inspired drive, switching his soft tyres on the second lap and running the remaining 48 tours with a set of hard tyres. He moved into fourth, holding Piastri at bay and only dropping behind at the chequered flag due to the penalty, before the McLaren disqualification moved the Italian up to an unlikely podium.

A seventh pole position of the season – achieved in treacherous conditions – put Norris in prime position for victory and practically allowed him to place one hand on a maiden Drivers' World Championship. The Briton aggressively cut across the front of Verstappen off the line but ran deep into Turn 1, dropping behind both Verstappen and Russell. Biding his time to overtake Russell in the second stint, Norris was comfortably P2 until backing off substantially over the final laps. The team's call was linked to concerns over skid block wear which would ultimately prove futile as he was disqualified – a result that could have huge ramifications for the title.

Another impressive Qualifying performance on a low-downforce, high-speed circuit similar to Baku left Carlos Sainz third on the grid, which eventually became P5 in the final classification. The Williams driver lost a position to Russell at the start but held quicker cars including Charles Leclerc and Piastri at bay over the opening stint, only slipping behind the pair after the pit stop sequence. Promoted two places due to McLaren's disqualification, Sainz achieved his second-best result of the season after his Baku podium, finishing more than 10 seconds clear of Isack Hadjar.

Having just missed out on a Q3 appearance after finishing P11 in Qualifying, Nico Hulkenberg utilised the hard tyre in the opening stint compared to all those ahead on the medium rubber. Extending his first stint, which ultimately allowed him to rejoin in P9, the Kick Sauber driver was never headed again and jumped up to seventh in the final classification. It has moved the team to within four and five points respectively of Aston Martin and Haas in the Constructors' Championship after back-to-back scores for the German.

A winner in Las Vegas 12 months ago, Russell ultimately had to settle for the runner-up spot in 2025 having nursed a steering issue from the opening laps. It didn't stop the Mercedes driver jumping ahead of poleman Norris on the first lap, though, and the Briton even challenged Verstappen in the first stint. Pushing too hard in the second stint destroyed his tyres and allowed Norris back ahead, but P2 beckoned with McLaren's impending infringement.

Going under the radar, Hadjar bagged more points for Racing Bulls and back-to-back scores in the process having been classified sixth in Las Vegas. The Frenchman qualified P8 but moved up several positions through the opening turn, finding himself initially in fifth before being re-passed by Piastri's McLaren and Leclerc's Ferrari in the opening stint. Having made his sole pit stop, Hadjar circulated alone for the second stint to solidify Racing Bulls' P6 in the Teams' Championship.

Having struggled for pace in a wet Qualifying, Leclerc put on a charge during the race and ultimately just fell short of a podium by two-tenths. Starting P9 and having just avoided been taken out through the opening corner, Leclerc went on to overtake Ollie Bearman, Piastri and Hadjar, as well as Sainz as the Williams exited the pits. Sub-optimal strategy meant he rejoined behind Piastri and slipped away from the battling McLaren driver and Antonelli ahead, the Ferrari driver eventually classified P4.

Left only P5 on the grid, Piastri slipped behind both Racing Bulls at the first corner which included contact from Liam Lawson. The Kiwi suffered an issue on the second lap allowing Piastri back ahead, but the McLaren driver then slipped behind Leclerc in the opening stint, only moving back ahead through the pit stop sequence. Stuck behind Antonelli in the final phase and eventually being disqualified from P4, a potential 30-point gap to Norris is just 24 heading to Qatar.

Quietly going about his business, Esteban Ocon raced on the fringes of the top 10 for much of proceedings, having started P13 and eventually finished just outside the points in P11. McLaren's double disqualification helped move Ocon and Haas team mate Bearman into the points, the American team also moving ahead of Aston Martin in the Teams' Championship by a single point as a result.

Bearman just misses out on a place in the top half of this week's Power Rankings, the Briton having run in the points in the early stages and re-passed Fernando Alonso in the second stint before taking P10.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Title fight reignites in Las Vegas

2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto explain what happened to their Alpine cars in Las Vegas.

Alpine had high hopes of picking up a point or two in Las Vegas, such was the pace Pierre Gasly had shown throughout the weekend at a track he tends to go well at. But despite starting in the top 10, the Frenchman's chances of scoring were over as soon as the race began, due to contact in the opening corner.

Gasly was hit and spun by Lance Stroll, who in turn had been hit by Gabriel Bortoleto, the Brazilian later handed a five-place grid drop for next weekend's race in Qatar for causing the collision. The contact put Stroll and Bortoleto into retirement, but Gasly was able to continue – albeit with a heavily damaged car.

But the moment dropped him to the back of the field, and missing downforce, the Frenchman never looked likely to recover back up the order. He came home 13th, two places ahead of his team mate.

“I just got absolutely crashed into and then spun around and lost about 10 points of downforce after 100 metres and the race was over. I'm trying to laugh about it, but it definitely doesn't make me laugh!” Gasly said.

“I think it's more frustration, and I'm just sad for the [team] because I felt good in the car the entire weekend, in the dry, in the wet.

"We did a good Quali and I was looking forward to the race and I don't fully understand what Gabi [Bortoleto] tried to do there, but unfortunately, he crashed into Stroll, who touched me and spun me and broke the back of my diffuser, so a very long afternoon."

Gasly qualified third here last year and fourth the year before but has yet to score in Vegas. The one positive he was able to take away from the weekend was the pace of the car, however.

"I think we could have had the pace to fight for the top 10. We could have been able to be right there or right behind, but we've lost quite a huge amount of downforce with that [hit]. The diffuser was gone.

“So to be sure, there was quite a lot more pace, but we will never know. Definitely, it feels a bit annoying. It's been three years where I've had amazing Quali and then, in the race, it's never translated into a good race. I was really hoping that this year could be different, but that's not the case."

As for Franco Colapinto, he too was hit at the start, by Alex Albon. The Argentine racer was able to carry on much as his team mate did, despite damage to the rear of the car and the diffuser.

"I just had damage from the start and after that, it was pretty bad. I had no grip, no rear, I was sliding all over the place, and I don't know if it was all down to damage or not, but it felt very bad, the balance, and just no grip on the rear,” Colapinto explained.

"Disappointing. A disappointing race, and just very slow."

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Toby Wallace (Euphoria, Bikeriders) has become the first actor officially set as a series regular in Netflix's Assassin's Creed live-action series, based on Ubisoft's best-selling video game franchise.


	Wallace is said to be playing the co-lead in Assassin's Creed, a high-octane thriller centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions — one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters — said to be different from the games — across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny.

	The series stems from a deal Netflix signed with Ubisoft in 2020. It is expected to start production in 2026 in Italy, which I hear serves as a setting of the series, with the exact time period unclear.  




			Watch on Deadline		







	Roberto Patino and David Wiener serve as showrunners. They executive produce with Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, Genevieve Jones for Ubisoft Film & Television, and Matt O'Toole.


	With more than 230 million units sold, the Assassin's Creed franchise is one of the best-selling series in video game history. 


	This marks Wallace's return to Netflix where he previously starred on the 2019 mystery YA drama series The Society. He recently wrapped shooting HBO's Euphoria as a new Season 3 series regular. 


	Wallace's recent feature credits include Jeff Nichols' The Bikeriders alongside Tom Hardy, Jodie Comer, and Austin Butler, Ron Howard's Eden alongside Jude Law and Sydney Sweeney, Charles Williams' Inside with Guy Pearce, as well as in Jusin Lin's Last Days.  .












	On TV, Wallace also starred in Danny Boyle's FX on Hulu limited series Pistol, in which he portrayed Sex Pistols' guitarist Steve Jones. Aussie Wallace, winner of the 2020 AACTA Best Lead Actor award and the 2019 Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best New Young Actor at the Venice Film Festival for Babyteeth, is repped by CAA, 3 Arts, CP Artist Management, and Sloane Offer.

Senior Managing Editor


	We're getting a first look at Scarpetta, Prime Video‘s new forensic crime thriller based on Patricia Cornwell's bestselling Kay Scarpetta book series, starring Nicole Kidman in the title role. The streamer has released several first-look photos which you can see above and below.


	Kidman stars as Dr. Kay Scarpetta, an unrelenting medical examiner, who with skilled hands and an unnerving eye is determined to serve as the voice of the victims, unmask a serial killer, and prove that her career-making case from 28 years prior isn't also her undoing. Set against the backdrop of modern forensic investigation, the series delves beyond the crime scene to explore the psychological complexities of both perpetrators and investigators, creating a multi-layered thriller that examines the toll of pursuing justice at all costs.

	The dual narrative explores Kay Scarpetta's (Kidman) journey from her beginnings as a Chief Medical Examiner in the late '90s to her present-day return to her hometown, where she resumes her former position while investigating a grisly murder. As Scarpetta pursues justice, she must navigate complicated relationships, including the fraught dynamic with her sister Dorothy Farinelli (Jamie Lee Curtis), confront long-held professional and personal grudges, and face secrets that threaten to unravel everything she's built.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In addition to Kidman and Curtis, Scarpetta stars Emmy winner Bobby Cannavale as Detective “Pete Marino,” with Emmy nominee Simon Baker as FBI profiler “Benton Wesley” and Oscar winner Ariana DeBose  as Kay's tech-savvy niece “Lucy Watson.” The series' dual timeline is completed by Rosy McEwen (Blue Jean), Amanda Righetti (The Mentalist), Jake Cannavale (The Offer), and Hunter Parrish (Weeds), who portray the past versions of Kidman, Curtis, Cannavale, and Baker's characters, respectively.


	Developed and written for television Liz Sarnoff, Scarpetta is executive produced by Kidman and Per Saari through Blossom Films, Curtis through Comet Pictures, writer and showrunner Sarnoff through Sarnoff TV, author Cornwell through P & S Projects, as well as Jason Blum, Jeremy Gold, Chris Dickie, and Chris McCumber through Blumhouse Television. David Gordon Green directed five episodes and also serves as executive producer alongside Amy Sayres. The series is produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Blumhouse Television in association with Blossom Films, Comet Pictures, and P&S Projects.

	











	Scarpetta premieres March 11 exclusive on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide.

Tara Reid is revealing the “scary” details surrounding her being allegedly drugged at a Chicago hotel bar over the weekend.

“It's just really scary. It's for all — not just girls, but for guys, for anyone. You have to really be careful with your drink,” she warned in an interview with TMZ Monday.

“It made me pass out for eight hours.”

The “American Pie” actress, 50, then alleged that she was transported from DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Chicago O'Hare Airport – Rosemont to a local hospital, where she “woke up eight hours later.”

Reid also told the outlet that doctors did not perform a blood alcohol test, adding, “They just said that you were drugged. That's what they said. They said, ‘You got drugged last night at the bar.'”

Additionally, she noted that she doesn't know what she was allegedly drugged with because, although she was “tested to see what drug it was,” she “didn't ask.”

“It was all kind of vague. Like, it was all blurry. … I can't even explain it because I don't even know what happened,” Reid added.

She then reiterated that she has no idea what doctors “did” in the hospital “because [she] was unconscious.”

In fact, she detailed thinking “[she] was in Mexico” because a “Mexican” lady was sitting next to her at the hospital and “wasn't speaking English.”

“I was so confused of what was happening,” she further stated, before sharing that her agent picked her up and took her to a signing event.

“We did it, and left. And I came back home. It was just a big blur,” the “Sharknado” actress added. “The whole thing is really scary. I'm just glad that I was in a public place. … And that there was security there to help me.”

She theorized that she could have gotten “raped” if she were at a “not public area,” noting, “I mean, a lot of things can be done really, really, really wrong.”

Reid then issued a stark warning to men and women.

“Everyone should really be aware about, you know, watching their drinks a lot because I don't know what that stuff was, but whatever it is, it knocked me out like immediately,” she said.

Page Six has reached out to the “National Lampoon” star's rep for comment, but did not immediately hear back.

Rosemont Public Safety Department Lieutenant Joseph Balogh told Page Six that no police report had been filed as of this publication — despite what Reid's rep said. 

However, he confirmed that his department received an EMS call for an ambulance, and the “patient was transported.” He said that there was “no other mention in any reports of it being drugs or suspicious activity.”

Balogh told us that his department is currently not investigating Reid's claims; however, they will when a proper report is filed and the “victim comes forward.”

“We're waiting for that on our end,” he told us.

Page Six also reached out to the Doubletree for comment, but did not immediately hear back.

On Monday, a video surfaced of an incoherent Reid being helped by hotel staff before being transported to a local hospital.

Following the incident, the actress claimed her drink had been spiked after she went outside to smoke a cigarette.

When Byron Howard and Rich Moore's smash hit (and eventual Best Animated Feature winner) “Zootopia” arrived in theaters in early 2016, the energetic and very funny fable turned a clever idea (a world only populated by mammals, but they sure act human!) into an enduring classic with some genuinely moving lessons to spare. How enduring? Well, nine years on, and the fervor around the film‘s long-awaited first sequel has in no way diminished. Fans are, well, they're feral for it. 

They may also be feral for some similarly long-awaited retconning and clarifications. As smart and savvy as the film's original premise is, it came with plenty of unanswered questions, like “why just mammals” and “where the heck are the birds and reptiles” and “what's the deal with the crackling romantic chemistry between our two leads, who happen to be different species.” And while directors Jared Bush (who co-wrote the first film and became chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios in 2024) and the returning Howard don't answer all of these queries, they address many of them, and still manage to come away with a sparkling and inventive sequel.

The film's opening sequence provides a very light catch-up on the events of the first film, reminding us of the bond between our leads (plucky bunny cop Judy Hopps, voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin, and her unlikely best pal, the former criminal fox Nick Wilde, voiced by Jason Bateman) and their big! unexpected! win! from the first film. Designed as a buddy cop outing, the first “Zootopia” saw the pair team up to take down a vast conspiracy that threatened the harmony of their home (and offered a sterling set of messages about the need for equality and understanding over racism and fear). 

 










But despite Nick and Judy's success — major enough that former con artist Nick has now officially joined the Zootopia Police Department to work alongside his zippy BFF — things just keep on moving in Zootopia. Taking place only a week after the events of the first film (the magic of animation!), questions already abound regarding the sustainability of Judy and Nick's partnership. And partnership, as Chief Bogo (voiced by Idris Elba) tells us and them, “is the cornerstone of success.” 

Are Nick and Judy really too different to succeed? A brand-new case offers some help. And, of course, plenty of hindrances. (At 108 minutes, the film does occasionally feel a bit too long, though the constant introduction of new locales and whiz-bang jokes manages to prop up most moments of flailing interest.)

Bush and Howard waste no time expanding the world of Zootopia, which is busy celebrating its “Zootennial,” a hundred years of harmony and prosperity within its heralded walls. And it's those walls we're about to hear plenty about, as Zootopia only really exists because of the clever construction of a series of “weather walls” that allow the numerous climates (and their mammal inhabitants) to co-exist side-by-side. Thank the powerful Lynxley family for such a gift, as everyone in Zootopia has long believed that Ebeneezer Lynxley was the one responsible for such a smart idea, and Zootopia itself.

 










There is, however, one kind of weird thing about all that. Reptiles! Miss 'em? The population of Zootopia doesn't, as legend has long held that Ebeneezer was nearly offed by a vicious viper just as he was preparing Zootopia and its weather walls. That viper even killed a beloved Lynxley family maid, a crime so heinous and so horrible that it led to the immediate banishment of every reptile in Zootopia, not just the snakes. See? That's why there are no reptiles in Zootopia. 

Except, well, Judy and Nick have maybe just found one. Judy, hellbent as ever on do-gooding and crime-fighting, even follows their slinky new potential baddie all the way to the Lynxley mansion during a massive gala (yes, the Shakira-voiced pop star Gazelle is also there, and she's stunning), during which the blue pit viper makes off with Ebeneezer's journal, which holds all of the early plans for the much-ballyhooed weather walls. Intent on proving the viability of their partnership, Judy and Nick alight on yet another case that puts the health and happiness of every Zootopia inhabitant on the line.

Following the proud lineage of films like “Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo” and “Step Up Revolution,” the real baddie of “Zootopia 2” is out-of-control property development and evil business tycoons. The Lynxley family may be responsible for the existence of Zootopia (emphasis on the may), but does that entitle them to bulldoze through whatever they want? All of Zootopia might be thrilled about the upcoming expansion of Tundratown, but no one seems at all concerned about what needs to be destroyed to make that happen. Not Chief Bogo, not newly installed handsome horse mayor Brian Winddancer (voiced by Patrick Warburton), not even the Big family, little Arctic shrew mafiosos who know a thing or two about being hunted.

 










But Judy cares. And that means Nick has to care, too. But as they zip through Zootopia, encountering new friends (like the Fortune Feimster-voiced beaver Nibbles Maplestick, obsessed with conspiracy theories) and new locations (like Marsh Market, a Disney-fied mash-up of Florida and New Orleans) along the way, their differences become more pronounced. And when that pit viper, who we soon learn is named Gary De'Snake (voiced by Ke Huy Quan), keeps popping up with a very new version of Zootopia's history, even Judy and Nick seem breakable. 

That's not to imply that “Zootopia 2” isn't funny, zippy, and highly enjoyable — it is indeed — but it's also got the kind of heart that has too long seemed to be missing from other Disney animated offerings. There's a weight to the messaging of the film. There's real care behind the bond between Nick and Judy. There's an absolutely incredible “The Shining” montage that will delight parents and terrify children for decades to come. Worth the wait? Yes, and we can't wait for the next one to take wing (wink).

Disney will release “Zootopia 2” in theaters on Wednesday, November 26.

EXCLUSIVE: There's been so much buzz about who will play a younger version of Scott Bakula's popular NCIS: New Orleans character Dwayne Pride in Season 2 of CBS‘ NCIS: Origins, and the wait is finally over. 


Shea Buckner (Only Murders in the Building) will appear in one episode to air later this season as Pride, who Bakula portrayed across the Louisiana-set show's seven seasons. A former Sheriff's Deputy, NIS Special Agent Dwayne Pride, is a newly minted Probationary Special Agent from the NIS Panama office in the prequel series. He has a history with Gibbs (Austin Stowell), and the two must resolve their past tension as they go undercover on a case.

	While the episode will focus heavily on Pride, it will also reunite the Fed Five task force, a group of exceptional NIS agents who found fame after unmasking the Privileged Killer, Spencer Hanlon, in the original NCIS‘ 11th season. The group consists of Leroy Jethro Gibbs (played originally by Mark Harmon), Michael Franks (Muse Watson), Dan McLane, Felix Betts (Stuart Margolin), and Pride. Gibbs and Franks already exist as young men on NCIS: Origins, played by Stowell and Kyle Schmid, respectively. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	As far as McLane and Betts are concerned, CBS has been seeing actors for the last couple of weeks.


	NIS Special Agent McLane is in his late 40s when he appears on NCIS: Origins, which is set in the 90s. He is described as smart, authoritative, confident, with an old school masculine energy. He works out of the NIS Panama office and is called in by the San Diego team to lead a joint task force aimed at stopping a stolen weapons ring.

	











	NIS Special Agent Felix Betts is in his 40s, and is described as a buttoned-up, likable and exuberant auditor and “paper-trail genius” from the Los Angeles NIS office, who is brought in to help a new task force. His superpower is sifting through mountains of bureaucratic paperwork, finding patterns that help solve cases.


	A little background on the Fed Five, the storyline was originally explored in a special two-part episode from Season 11 of NCIS: “Crescent City” Parts 1 (episode 18) and 2 (episode 19), which served as the backdoor pilot for NCIS: New Orleans and introduced Pride to the universe. The episodes investigate the murder of McLane, a former NIS agent turned congressman, and the Fed Five's boss. With the 90s setting on Origins, the storyline works seamlessly as the task force disbanded in 1994.


Origins showrunners Gina Lucita Monrealand and David J. North have previously discussed their intention and excitement to explore the history of the franchise on the prequel. In the upcoming special episode, they will do just that by sharing insight into Pride and Gibbs' relationship, as well as expanding their legacies.


	Further details regarding the big Pride episode are as yet unknown. For now, the plan is for the five-some to appear in one episode, but who knows what the future holds after the characters are introduced? It's as yet unknown if the Privileged Killer case will be revisited, but that would certainly be a bonus for longtime fans.


NCIS: Origins also stars Mariel Molino, Caleb Foote, Tyla Abercrumbie and Diany Rodriguez. The series is produced by CBS Studios. David J. North, Gina Lucita Monreal, Mark Harmon and Sean Harmon serve as executive producers. New episodes of NCIS: Origins‘ second season air Tuesday nights at 9 p.m. ET/PT. 


	Buckner was most recently seen as Tony Caccimelio in the current season of the Hulu hit comedy Only Murders in the Building, one of Sofia (Téa Leoni) and Nicky (Bobby Cannavale) Caccimelio's sons. Additionally, he also starred in the lead role of Stanley Kowalski in the Bay Street Theater's off-Broadway production of “A Streetcar Named Desire.” He is a former Olympian having previously competed on the US team in Water Polo. Buckner is represented by Gersh and Vault Entertainment.

Anna Wintour has got the Bezoses' backs.

The Vogue global editorial director defended Lauren Sánchez and Jeff Bezos amid fierce backlash over their newly announced role as lead sponsors of the 2026 Met Gala.

“I think Lauren is going to be a wonderful asset to the museum and to the event,” Wintour, 76, told CNN in a red carpet interview on Sunday at the Franca Fund gala in Doha, Qatar.

“We're very grateful for her incredible generosity,” she continued. “She's a great lover of costume and obviously of fashion, so we're thrilled she's part of the night.”

The endorsement comes after the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced last week that the Bezoses would bankroll next year's Costume Institute exhibition and accompanying gala alongside secondary sponsors Saint Laurent and Condé Nast. 

The theme of the May 4 fête and spring show is “Costume Art,” exploring the role of the “dressed body” throughout the museum's collection.

The news of the Bezoses' involvement sparked swift outcry on social media.

Instagram users flooded the museum's announcement of the exhibition with comments arguing the couple is attempting to “buy” cultural legitimacy.

“This is such an iconic theme and it's so so so sad to see it gutted and trashed by the choice in sponsorship,” one user wrote.

“The Metropolitan Museum of Art, SOLD!!! to the highest bidder,” another chimed in. “How distasteful.”

Tech titans footing the bill for the Costume Institute isn't exactly new territory — Amazon sponsored the event back in 2012, and TikTok, Instagram, Apple, and Yahoo have all written checks in years past. Billionaires Stephen A. Schwarzman and his wife, Christine, underwrote the 2018 exhibition. 

The Bezoses have also been on the fashion offensive this year, sitting front row at Paris Fashion Week and palling around with the Kardashian-Jenners at exclusive brand dinners and industry fêtes. 

The former journalist, 55, and her Amazon founder husband, 61, skipped the 2025 Met Gala as they were preparing for their June nuptials, but they made their red-carpet debut as a couple at the 2024 event. Sánchez also appeared on a digital cover of Vogue this June in her white lace Dolce & Gabbana wedding dress.

Serena Williams is a loving mother along with being a sports legend. Now, she's combining the two aspects of her life by introducing her adorable little one, two-year-old Adira, to tennis.

Taking to Instagram on Monday, November 24, Serena — who is married to Alexis Ohanian and is also the mother to older daughter Olympia — shared a series of photos of herelf on a bright blue tennis court surrounded by trees. With her on the court is Adira, looking tiny, adorable and ready to play. Both mom and toddler hold tennis rackets and pass a ball between them.

In the caption, Serena wrote, “This is me sharing my passion for tennis with my youngest daughter.”

While playing tennis with Adira as a toddler is surely a memory that Serena will keep forever, it's also a sweet moment that her fans are happy that she shared. Beyond that, they're thrilled to see the little one exploring her mom's sport.

One person wrote, “I think she is the one to carry on that tennis greatness and create her own legacy.”

“If your daughters play tennis it would be epic and a legit reincarnation 🤏🏾💞❤️,” came from another follower.

Someone else left a comment saying, “Awww 😍😍🥺💕 2040 USOPEN CHAMPION! 🏆🔥🎾💪🏾”

“She'll be a champion like you… it's in her blood,” another person wrote.

Yet another follower wrote, “This is me saying how precious this truly is. You are an amazing mommy in addition to your endless list of amazing qualities. Love you so much! @serenawilliams”

If Adira does decide to pursue tennis, she'll be entering a super competitive world. Fortunately, her mom says that she's already pretty darn strong.

“Olympia is a very hard act to follow, but I tell you what, Adira has followed it and it's just so crazy,” Serena told People in November 2024.

“She's amazing,” the proud mom continued. “I just can't wait for people to see how amazing she is in her own way. And she's so special and she's so tough. She's just a tough little cookie. And she reminds me a lot of me in that aspect.”

Serena also talked about becoming a mother of two, saying, “Olympia was a solo child. She was our star. And I am so obsessed with Olympia. Even when I was pregnant, I was like, ‘How do I even love anyone as much as Olympia? It just doesn't work.'”

However, she added, “It's so funny how, I don't know, just your heart gets bigger. I was just like, my heart just got bigger.”

After some months off the campaign trail, there have been questions surrounding how Ryan Coogler's hit “Sinners” can once again be top of mind for voters, now that much of awards voting has commenced. While the Southern Gothic vampire thriller came back to theaters for a bit around Halloween, it had not yet gone full speed ahead with For Your Consideration events, the kind that gather much of the cast and crew to state their case about why the film should be deemed the best that 2025 cinema had to offer.

Wisely, the folks behind the “Sinners” campaign took a beat to let other contenders schedule screenings, Q&As, and receptions around the Governors Awards, which is primetime for gathering Academy members back to Los Angeles, and set their events for midway through the following week, when things had died down.

The “Sinners” campaign weekend commenced with a Wednesday night screening on the Warner Bros. lot attended by most of the cast, including Delroy Lindo, Jayme Lawson, Omar Miller, and Michael B. Jordan, who had so far been able to do little press for the movie, as he's currently directing and starring in the latest “The Thomas Crown Affair” remake. The following morning, the actor reunited with “Sinners” director Ryan Coogler to commemorate their late friend and “Black Panther” collaborator Chadwick Boseman at his long-awaited Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony.

Similarly scheduled far in advance of any awards conversations was an event organized around Michael B. Jordan accepting the American Cinematheque Award later that Thursday night at The Beverly Hilton, home of the Golden Globes ceremony. After speeches from stars Jordan has shared the screen with, like Tessa Thompson, Daniel Kaluuya, and Octavia Spencer, as well as more unexpected presenters like Mahershala Ali, Ben Affleck, and Bradley Cooper, it was the previously reserved Coogler who most successfully lightened the mood.

“I'm really upset because I never had to follow up that many incredible actors before,” said the filmmaker, referencing how he was even preceded by his Oscar-nominated “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” star Angela Bassett popping on screen to send Jordan well wishes. “I'm about to go on stage and they're like, ‘Hold on, it's a video,' and it's fucking Tom Cruise.”

Coogler had little to worry about, as his stories of the decade-plus he and Jordan have worked together on five films was one of the highlights of the night, equally as funny as it was informative about what makes the “Sinners” star a great actor. For example, to help distinguish between the twins, he borrowed a technique from the making of “The Godfather” and wore shoes that were a size too small for Stack, “so he was never comfortable,” and a size too big for Smoke, “so he wouldn't move unless it was necessary.”

 










Coogler ended his speech by saying “even the brightest stars start off from the ground up in blue collar positions. Every single one of these incredible actors that came up and spoke, producers that came up and spoke, none of them had Hollywood connections before they started. I know all their stories. They came up blue collar and had a dream and went for it and it paid off.”

That sentiment about finding success from any background extended into Jordan's own acceptance speech. “Everybody talks about chasing dreams. Nobody really talks about how to build,” said the actor and filmmaker. At his production company, Outlier Society, “we always say to build a house and they'll come. And we've been building this house for a while.” Jordan added that, early in his career, he asked himself, “‘Who could I be? Was I a leading man? Did I have what it takes?' All questions and doubts and things a young actor has. I didn't have those answers yet. And when you don't have those answers, you keep your head down and you do the work. That's it. That's the only thing you can really control.”

 










Jordan thanked the director for changing his life, and said, “We took risks. We said ‘Our stories deserved to be told.' And people overwhelmingly responded. Kids saw themselves on the screens in ways they hadn't before. And that was the whole point. That's the power of storytelling, empathy, connection. ‘Sinners' brought me back to my beginnings.”

The next event provided yet another full circle moment, with the Warner Bros. events team transforming South LA eatery Somerville into a juke joint complete with the same signage as the film. The Friday night event had a purpose that was twofold: to hand Coogler's Proximity Media the key to the WB lot and to celebrate the music of “Sinners.” Present among the crowd inside the intimate space were the film's cast and crew — who joked the room triggered memories of night shoots — plus celebrities like Don Cheadle, Sterling K. Brown, Natasha Lyonne, Anika Noni Rose, and Daniel Scheinert. 

Prior to presenting the key to Proximity Media founders Ryan and Zinzi Coogler and Sev Ohanian, Warner Bros. Motion Picture chairs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy gave speeches where the latter said, “This has been one of the most extraordinary experiences ever,” in reference to “Sinners,” and that the producers “are visionaries, they are passionate, they are loyal, they are some of the greatest people I've ever met and have gotten to know, and I will forever be blessed and privileged to have this experience.”

 










Looking toward the future, De Luca said, “We're so up for anything you guys want to do. We think it's so important to bring new voices to the table and it's in that spirit, in that tradition and with our unending gratitude for the movie ‘Sinners' that we'd like to present to you the key to the studio for Warner Brothers.”

While Ohanian and Zinzi Coogler expressed how their experience making “Sinners” validated their company's mission to create cinematic events that draw audiences closer to overlooked subjects, and also proved what Proximity could accomplish as the sole production company on a project, the film's director addressed De Luca and Abdy directly, saying “so much of this is about timing. It took me my whole life to make this movie over a decade, to process the death of my uncle who inspired it. And I was so happy that it worked out for us to have this company, to have this screenplay, to have all these relationships at the same time that you guys got the power of one of the legacy studios.”

He continued, “I know you guys are lovers of cinema. Each of you individually and together have made movies that have shaped the culture, movies that have inspired us. Your careers are very storied. So it was an honor to go to battle for you guys. And at this time where so much was at stake, both of you guys individually and for the industry, it was awesome to have the ball in our hands for an opportunity to get folks out to the theaters. And you guys believed in us the entire time. Never wavered.”

 










The film's composer Ludwig Göransson, who had performed one of the Best Original Song submissions “I Lied to You” with his co-songwriter Raphael Saadiq and breakout “Sinners” performer Miles Caton at the American Cinematheque event the night before, was the one to transition the conversation over to music, with a story about how working on the film afforded him the opportunity to take his father on a Blues trail trip — a dream he had put off for decades.

The trio's arrangement of “I Lied to You,” the centerpiece song that precedes “Sinners” most talked-about musical moment, is extremely savvy. Saadiq, a three-time Grammy-winning artist and producer in his own right, eases listeners in with the first verse, only for Caton to then blow the room off each venue with his soulful runs in the back half of the blues song. 

The upstart actor, who used to be a backup singer for Oscar winner H.E.R., also co-wrote a song on the “Sinners” soundtrack, a duet with co-writer Alice Smith called “Last Time (I Seen The Sun),” that's the other Best Original Song submission for the film. Though it took a second for the lively audience to quiet down, Caton and Smith's dynamic vocal performances more than made the case for “Sinners” to have both songs make it into the category, if not spoil what has long been expected to be a “Golden” victory. Later in the night, Göransson's wife Serena, who was the executive music producer on “Sinners,” brought Smith back out for a dazzling rendition of “I Put a Spell on You,” and blues legend Buddy Guy, who makes a cameo in the film, even hopped on the small stage to perform a song.

 










The Juke Joint event might have felt too hard to top, but the “Sinners” weekend still ended on a high note with brunch at La Ola at the Four Seasons Beverly Hills on Saturday morning, and a nighttime screening and Q&A moderated by Oscar winner Barry Jenkins at the Academy Museum that had the 939-seat David Geffen Theater packed to the gills. Jordan also stepped away for a solo Q&A at the Aero Theatre in front of 400+ people.

This one weekend of effort felt like enough to stake away any concerns that “Sinners” will have a tough time being a major Oscars contender. But, at this point, the film exceeding expectations is nothing new.

The two stars will release 'Better Late Than Never' together on Nov. 28. How did they manage to keep it a secret?


													By
												

	Sigal Ratner-Arias


Deputy Editor, Billboard Español


Romeo Santos arrives wearing a face mask and a hoodie. He's not sick, just determined to avoid being recognized as he enters our New York studios, and immediately heads to his dressing room with his small entourage. Minutes later, Prince Royce walks through the door, just as quickly and discreetly, with a cap under the hood of his sweater covering half his face.

	











	The two have been seen together in the past, but only as friends on social media. Today, the last Wednesday of October, they're here to announce something completely different: Romeo Santos and Prince Royce, the “king” and “prince” of bachata, respectively, are finally collaborating, not on a single song, but on an entire album.


	Their collaboration has been the best-kept secret in Latin music in years. Appropriately titled Better Late Than Never, the 13-song album will arrive Nov. 28 on Sony Music Latin, where only a small group of people knew of its existence.


	Close friends and family were also unaware. (Coincidentally, Royce's brother, who works as a photographer in New York, only learned of the project when he joined the team that shot the cover for this Billboard Español story and saw both artists' names on the call sheet.) Many of the musicians who played on the album think it's by one or the other, since both artists deliberately summoned their sidemen separately and were never seen together in the studio.

	











	The result is pure synergy: “There's no one taking center stage here,” Santos says. “There isn't a song where he sings more than me or me more than him.”


	I listened to the album the day before, when Santos — as he's done in the past with Billboard — picked me up in a Cadillac Escalade V and played it for me from beginning to end, responding to my questions and reactions with the joy of someone who knows he has something special in his hands. He's never been one to share files of his work through email before their release, and he certainly wasn't going to risk it this time.


Better Late Than Never has the essence of Santos and Royce throughout but also offers something fresh for both artists. There are classic bachatas, more modern takes and mostly romantic lyrics, and the fusion of their recognizable voices is captivating from the first track, which shares the album's title.


	Songs such as “Dardos” and “Jezebel” stand out, the latter displaying strong R&B influences, as well as “Ay San Miguel,” a Dominican palo, and “Menor,” a surprising first collaboration for Santos with an emerging talent, Dalvin La Melodía — who also hadn't yet been informed about Royce's participation.


	Santos and Royce wrote four of the songs together, starting with “Mi Plan,” penned during a friends trip to St. Barts in 2023, and “Better Late Than Never,” “Jezabel” and “Loquita Por Mí.” The rest were mostly written by Santos, always with Royce's participation and honest input. But the seed of this production has been germinating since at least 2017, when they recorded the first of three failed attempts that will likely never see the light of day.

	











	“I don't want to sound cliché or overly religious, but God's timing is perfect,” Santos says, explaining why now was the right time. “When we started recording the first song seven years ago, there was a little resistance from both of us. I felt convinced at the time… the vibe was there, but then we started evaluating it and [realized], ‘Mmm, this is not the song.'”


	“There was a moment where I said, ‘Man, are we ever going to find that fusion, that muse, where we both feel comfortable and can say, ‘This is great?' ” Royce adds. “And it wasn't that I doubted it, but it required going in and really delving into it — and suddenly there was a switch.”


	The launch strategy was equally secretly planned. On Oct. 31, Halloween, Santos, unrecognizable in an Ace Ventura costume, announced on his Instagram account “new album November 28” — with a link in his bio to preorder it — along with a video of him partying in New York with an album in his hands. Days later, on Nov. 10, a massive listening party for his fans scheduled for Nov. 26 at Madison Square Garden was announced on Univision shows such as Despierta América and El Gordo y La Flaca and radio station WXNY-FM (La X 96.3) New York, where listeners could call in to win tickets. According to Santos' publicist, at the time of the announcement, 7,000 people were online looking for tickets, all assuming that “it's a [solo] Romeo album.”


	Of course, there were no singles or previews. A music video featuring two songs — “Estocolmo” and “Dardos” — will be released simultaneously with the album. To communicate with the director, they used the code names “Batman” and “Robin.”

	











	The collaboration between the two powerhouses is highly anticipated by bachata fans, and the fact that the project wasn't rushed gives it new urgency and importance. Superstars of the genre from different generations, they are also very different in style — Santos with his sweet, high-pitched voice and use of traditional guitars; Royce with his light lyric tenor and a more pop/urban sound. And both have redefined the genre. Santos, 44, revived bachata when it was considered traditional regional music, giving it a sensual twist with touches of contemporary New York that captivated a new generation. Royce, 36, came later with bachata versions of Motown classics.


	Santos rose to fame in the mid-1990s as leader of the group Aventura before launching a brilliant solo career in 2011 with Fórmula, Vol. 1, the longest-running bachata album by a solo artist on Billboard's Top Latin Albums chart (17 weeks at No. 1); more recently, he was No. 2 on the Top Latin Artists of the 21st Century list (behind only Bad Bunny). Royce debuted in 2010 with a self-titled set that reached No. 1 on Top Latin Albums, which he has topped five times.


	Both born in the Bronx to Dominican parents (except for Santos' mother, who is Puerto Rican), they met at a family party. “Aventura was huge at the time,” Royce recalls. “I was in my room playing PlayStation. I heard the revolú [commotion], so many people outside. I went out and took a picture [with him],” adding that he was starstruck by the singer's presence. Now, “This is a full-circle moment. What Romeo and Aventura have done has inspired me.”


	“Romeo Santos and Prince Royce are two wonderful artists, two exceptional professionals — and even better human beings — who have dedicated their careers to bringing bachata to the world,” Afo Verde, chairman/CEO of Sony Music Latin Iberia, told me days after the interview. “Each of the songs on this brilliant album reflects the talent, creativity, passion and dedication of both of them. We can't wait for all the fans to experience this magical album they've created together.”

	











	Sitting down to talk for the first time about their most closely guarded secret in an exclusive interview with Billboard Español, Santos and Royce delve into the project, their friendship and the future of the genre that made them famous.


To begin, who approached whom? Who said, “Let's do it”?


Romeo Santos: I'd like to take credit, but the truth is, the first person to mention the idea of recording not one, not two, but a whole album, was this gentleman right here. (Gestures to Royce.) And that was literally seven years ago, right?


Prince Royce: A long time ago, yes. I felt a lot of pressure from the public, really. If we make a song, what will it be? It can have pop elements, it can have very traditional elements, it can be a fusion. And I was thinking about how to fuse these two worlds, which, although it's bachata, are two different styles of bachata. I always thought, “Man, how iconic would it be if we made an album, if we could give everyone these different kinds of flavors and colors?”


Santos: Yes, because that's a valid point. When he says “the pressure,” it's like a song will have an audience who will say, “I like this one,” but there will be another type of fan who will say, “Yes, but it's too slow.” There are those who say, “Yes, but it's too fast.” “Yes, but it doesn't have that bitterness or it's too depressing.” We have a production that fills all the gaps.


You recorded three previous tracks — one in 2017 for Golden, another in 2022 for Fórmula, Vol. 3 and a third later — and none of them were released. After three attempts, what motivated you to keep trying and not give up?












Santos: I think we started evaluating the three songs we had already recorded. “Where was the problem? How could the chorus of these three songs be improved? Was it the verse, the arrangement?” And at least I had the goal of making the songs feel organic, not like we took a song, sent a verse to Royce or vice versa, just to say we collaborated. I think it had to happen this way: three failed attempts to lead to this production. I don't think I could have worked with Royce in a more ideal way. The best songs we were able to create are on this album.


Royce: I think for me it was, “We shouldn't rush things.” Nowadays a lot of people lack patience, and I've always been very patient. I'm not a quitter, and he's definitely not a quitter.


Santos: And you know what I respect? He was honest with me about those three songs. I mean, if he had been a hypocrite and told me, “They're great,” this project wouldn't have happened. But he was like, “I don't know, loco, they're OK, but do you think so?” So I kind of analyzed them. And honestly, every time I presented him with a song, I felt it was better than the last one.


How is it possible that none of this leaked in all these years? 


Santos: Well, I'll just say that in the world of privacy, I'm an expert. I feel very comfortable, even if it's a little stressful, working on projects with the element of surprise. I'm used to it; I don't like to prepare people.


Royce: In my case, I just don't want to jinx it either. I know how he works, I've known him for many years. For me it was such an important project that I wanted the element of surprise, I wanted to surprise the audience, I wanted to focus on the project without anyone interfering and simply work. 

	











Santos: Another factor was that we genuinely posted photos and videos together because we were hanging out. I think that when people saw those pictures and didn't hear any music, they kind of overlooked it. And I didn't know at the time that this was also what would work as a strategy for us. We managed to keep it a secret for several reasons. Also because technology has changed so radically these days that you can record a production, an album, whatever at home. We didn't go to public studios; everything was recorded during vacations — we were in a villa with our friends and family, in my home studio in New York. We visited his house many times. That part was easy, honestly. 


Tell me about “Batman” and “Robin.”


 Santos: Ah, that was the code.


Royce: I called it the “Bora Project” with my small team. 


Santos: We created this “Batman” and “Robin” thing, but for different aspects; for filming music videos, talking to the director: “Remember, Royce is Robin, I'm Batman.” Until it became second nature. Now I say to him: “What's up, Robin?” 


The fact that the record label hasn't even heard the album speaks volumes about the creative freedom the label has given you to work together.


Santos: Look, I'm very grateful to Afo [Verde], to the whole Sony team really, but Afo is one of those people who respects the creative side of artists. And I remember sending Afo a message about two months ago, more or less, saying, “Brother, I have a project that I think is going to excite you. You're going to love it, and I want to share this project with you. I want you to listen to it, to be one of the first.” Afo tells me, “I knew you were planning something,” because my last post was, if I'm not mistaken, on Jan. 8 of this year, and I've been ghosting on social media. 

	











How easy or difficult was it working together as two big artists with such distinctive styles?


Royce: From the moment we made that first song [that actually worked], everything flowed for me. It was like there was a whole year where I felt like we were creating something incredible. I was so happy. And I really admire how he pushed me in the studio. 


Santos: Thank you. I'm kind of a maniac.


Royce: I hadn't felt like that in a long time. The fact that I thought I was doing well and [he'd tell me], “No, you can do better, bro,” and just keep at it…


Santos: And vice versa, because I'm so used to directing myself that sometimes you overlook certain things you stop doing as a performer. … The interesting thing about this project is that it has his essence, my essence, but musical proposals that neither of us has offered to the fans before. 


Who was more involved in the production? 


Santos: I would say I was… [But] I reiterate: He was very key because he trusted me, but also kind of challenged me. When I showed him a song, he was very honest, as he's always been. So I went in already with that challenge. 


What new elements will the audience hear? 


Royce: There are new elements like “Dardos,” which has a lot of fusion. There are Afrobeat vibes, tropical vibes, different types of guitars, violins. [The song] “Better Late Than Never” starts off very pop, a cappella. And I think there are many elements, within bachata as well, in the way the guitar is played; there's a bit of a rock flow. 


What did you think when you heard the album for the first time in its entirety?  


Santos: We hugged with happiness.

	











Royce: I was jumping around, I was tipsy. … I was super excited. For me, it has been an honor to record this album. It has been a very beautiful experience in the studio as well. 


Santos: You know what I used to tell him? “This pendejo sings beautifully!” Because I was listening to him from a different perspective. I love producing, and when you create a melody thinking of someone else, in my case, I enjoy it more than I enjoy singing it myself. And sometimes he sang a melody even better than what I envisioned. 


Were you already a fan of Prince Royce's music?


Santos: There's a mutual respect. I've always told him about the songs I love from his repertoire. For me, “Incondicional” is one of those songs that, if you ask me what Romeo hasn't done in bachata, both with Aventura and as a solo artist, when I heard that song I said, “F–k, mariachi with bachata!” That was great. 


Royce, is there a song by Romeo you wish you had written? 


Royce: There are many. I've always been a fan of “La Novelita” by Aventura. “Infieles.” “Eres Mía”… I think he's a walking encyclopedia of bachata; he knows every bachata song and has a lot of musical knowledge. And he's a genius with lyrics, truly. 


As friends and colleagues, do you ever call each other for advice?


Santos: Of course. We've talked a lot long before this project. It's a truly genuine friendship. 


Prince, what's the best advice you remember Romeo giving you?


Royce: There are many that I probably can't say on camera. No, just kidding. (Laughs.) In terms of advice — not just musical; it could be business, it could be personal — we've had many conversations and he's always been, I really mean it, very real with me… And I've always respected that. 

	











Santos: I can tell you that one piece of advice he gave me once was, “Don't take things so seriously.” I have that problem. Sometimes we forget to have fun. Especially when you have a plan, the rollout, marketing, a million things, and I feel like he has that quality. He loves what he does, just like I do, but maybe I'm too… What's the word? 


Royce: Particular, detail-oriented…


Santos: Yeah, sometimes that kind of takes away the fun.


Let's talk about the state of bachata. How do you see the genre right now?


Santos: How far the genre has come is impressive, especially when you see artists who aren't bachata singers navigating this genre of heartbreak. When I listen to Rosalía, Manuel Turizo, Maluma, Shakira, Rauw Alejandro, Karol G, that's an excellent sign that good work has been done since the beginning. 


However, a superstar on the level of Romeo Santos and Prince Royce hasn't emerged. Why do you think this has happened? 


Santos: I think there are a lot of Prince Royces and Romeos in an attic, in a basement, creating the new sound. The thing is, this business isn't easy. And when I say it's not easy, it's not easy for us either. There's a very essential key that few apply, and that's perseverance. If you analyze my career, people remember Aventura from “Obsesión,” but we'd been hard at work six years prior to that.


Royce: I think a lot of people always see the success but they never see the failures, what didn't happen, the doors you knocked on. And I think that nowadays it's very important to be different… and to bring something that Romeo Santos didn't bring and that Prince Royce didn't bring, because they're already here.

	











Going back to your wonderful project, an album is usually followed by a tour. Do you plan to go on the road together? What do you envision for that show?


Santos: Obviously, yes, we are considering a tour, God willing, and a worldwide one so people can enjoy both of our repertoires. And when it happens, God willing, we don't want it to feel like a show where he goes onstage, sings his setlist, then I sing mine. No. We want it to be an experience where, whether you're a fan of Royce and me or just a fan of him or just of me, it's a musical journey through both of our repertoires.


What would you say to Prince Royce fans who aren't Romeo Santos fans, and to Romeo Santos fans who aren't Prince Royce fans? 


Royce: Well, personally, I think they're going to become fans of all of us. 


Santos: You want to know what I'd tell his fans? That they're going to have to put up with Romeo! (Laughs.) No, but seriously, this is a treat, a gift for both sets of fans, because I think — and I don't want to sound repetitive — that it's a production where each song is dedicated to different styles, to his essence, to mine. But there's something else you'll notice about it: There's no one taking center stage here. There isn't a song where he sings more than me or me more than him. Maybe your favorite part of this particular song is Royce's chorus, and maybe your favorite part is the pre-hook I did, but I hope you like it, that it evokes some kind of emotion in you in a positive way, because we made it with all the love we could put into a project.

Welcome to IndieWire's “Eyes Wide Shut” Week. The password is, of course, “fidelio,” but we've already taken care of admittance, inviting you into five days of stories celebrating Stanley Kubrick's swan-song masterpiece from 1999. Criterion Collection has just unveiled its 4K restoration of the classic erotic mystery starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, and it now looks better than ever, gloriously, at home. 

Though “Eyes Wide Shut” is very much one of IndieWire's favorite Christmas movies, we'll be unveiling over the Thanksgiving week interviews with director of photography Larry Smith, second unit cinematographer Malik Hassan Sayeed, editor Nigel Galt, set decorator Lisa Leone, and star and Kubrick mentee Todd Field, aka Nick Nightingale, blindfolded piano player to the sex-crazed elite. “Give up your inquiries, which are completely useless.”

Way before Todd Field became the acclaimed director of “In the Bedroom,” “Little Children,” and “TÁR” — one of the best runs ever for any filmmaker — the AFI Conservatory graduate starred as Nick Nightingale in Stanley Kubrick's “Eyes Wide Shut.” He played Nick Nightingale, a pianist and former college friend of Dr. Bill Hartford's (Tom Cruise), who is summoned to a mass orgy of the elite somewhere ominously outside New York City. 

 










Field went back and forth to the United Kingdom from 1996 to 1998 to complete shooting on the film, which includes said orgy scene in which Nick Nightingale is masked at the piano as Dr. Bill is humiliated once again. “Eyes Wide Shut” is now in re-release on home video, thanks to a new Criterion Collection 4K edition of the film supervised by cinematographer Larry Smith. It's an opportunity to revisit Field's superb, relaxed performance, one that tested his own limited piano-playing skills (his character has a Greenwich Village residency at the fictional Sonata Café, where he reacquaints with Cruise's character).

Field has spoken publicly before about how his co-star, Tom Cruise, helped him wrest a cut of his directing debut “In the Bedroom” from potential changes urged by Miramax head Harvey Weinstein. But as revealed in a conversation exclusive to IndieWire, Kubrick was instrumental in encouraging Field to make the marital breakdown drama “In the Bedroom,” nominated for five 2002 Oscars including Best Picture and adapted from the Andre Dubus story “Killings,” at all.

Below, Field talks his amusing first meeting with Kubrick on set, what it was like to work with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, and the heightened atmosphere around the orgy masquerade leading up to filming.

 










This interview was conducted over email.

IndieWire: Stanley Kubrick died in March 1999, less than a week after reportedly showing a cut of the film to Warner Bros. executives. There are rumors that the theatrical version — censored orgy scenes aside — was not the film he intended. Do you have any reason to believe that?

Todd Field: What we have is Stanley's first cut. He died six days after screening that cut for Tom, Nic, [and Warner Bros. chiefs] Bob [Daly] and Terry [Semel]. If Stanley's post-production on past films is taken into even modest consideration, it's clear that the film would be different. However, it would be foolish to try and speculate about what might have changed had Stanley lived to make it so.

What was your last conversation with Kubrick, or do you remember the last time you heard from him?

After we wrapped. He was upbeat and asked if I'd stop at Rank [Laboratory, where the negatives were processed] on my way back to London and deliver the dailies, and also that I send him the second draft of “In the Bedroom.” He'd been generous to read the first, so I agreed but never sent it. I had another shoot coming up outside London in March '99, and was supposed to see Stanley when Tom called to tell me he had died.

You are often described as a mentee or protégé of Kubrick's, but how would you define that, exactly? And beyond him casting and directing you as Nick Nightingale?  Did he take an interest in your directing work, as by then you'd made a number of shorts through AFI? A year and a half after “Eyes Wide Shut” opened, you were showing “In the Bedroom” at Sundance.
 










Stanley was, and forever will be, an influence on every filmmaker. He established a language we all use, whether you've worked with him or not. But yes, I'd just graduated from AFI, and my excitement in working with him was more than just as an actor. The first time we met, Jan Harlan drove me to Luton Hoo [a manor house in Bedfordshire where “Eyes Wide Shut” was partially shot], where Stanley was doing lighting tests and told me to just go inside, find the ballroom, and introduce myself. That house had a hundred rooms — I had a Leica with me and spent the better part of the day photographing all of them before finally working up the nerve to stand outside that ballroom and spy on him through a doorway. After a while, he turned, leveled me with that gaze of his, and said, “You're here. Come inside and see what we're doing.” I stumbled forward, held out my hand, and said, “I'm Todd Field.” Stanley laughed, “I know who the fuck you are, I hired you. Can I see that?” 

He asked what an M-6 was going for these days, then showed me the Polaroid-backed Linhoff Technika he was using. He tacked prints side-by-side for comparison and explained he was exposing third-stop increments to determine how much he'd be able to push the film — in this case, EXR 5298, whose production Kodak was planning to discontinue. He wasn't crazy about their new stock — the Vision 5279 — but said Kodak had assured him he'd have an uninterrupted supply of 98 for the shoot. 

 










That introduction to Stanley was consistent with everything I experienced afterward. If you showed an interest in his interests, he'd share in detail how he was trying to achieve them. He invited me to look at dailies and was open about his process. He sat me down and asked questions and shared thoughts about how I might want to go about making “In the Bedroom.” It's impossible to describe how valuable his certainty was that I would make the film.

“Eyes Wide Shut” is often described as the longest film shoot of all time, though a lot of that time involved starts and stops to accommodate holidays and time home and away from Pinewood Studios for actors to be with family. You are in a handful of key scenes in the film; what was your experience like with his supposedly exacting preference for multiple takes?

Stanley did many takes. But this was for a practical reason. He wasn't interested in realism. He wanted things to have the kind of intensity he grew up with watching classic studio movies. Stanley pointed out that, back then, a studio actor would rehearse their dialogue with real hand props weeks before arriving on set. And because of this, there was a kind of sophistication in the way they picked up a glass of water, or smoked a cigarette, or delivered a line while doing those things. There was nothing real about it — but it cast a spell on you and was magical to watch.

 










It's typical for directors to shoot as many as six set-ups with takes in the 30-to-60 range. Whereas Stanley shot just one or two set-ups and rarely more than 25 takes, and rarer still 60. He wanted a process that involved uninterrupted repetition, enabling an actor to get out of their head and as far as possible from what he considered to be postmodern screen acting.

Was there a particular scene that was most challenging (or even easiest) in that regard? 

The first scene, where Bill reunites with Nick at Ziegler's [Sydney Pollack] party. We did 18 takes, which for Stanley wasn't a lot, and afterward he said, “Wow, that was great, really great, but the first 17 you were lousy. I mean, the difference between take 18 and all the rest is remarkable.” I said, “Look, Stanley, I was nervous. I'm here with the biggest star in the world and my favorite filmmaker, and you're lucky I didn't piss my pants.” He laughed, and after that it was easy. He read wild lines with me himself. And, like Marty Scorsese, he was a terrific actor. And that was a beautiful thing — the way he played.

Are you featured in the masked orgy scene in any way beyond being at the piano?

Nick Nightengale is blindfolded at the keyboard in the ritual hall, then escorted past nude dancers — he's not directly involved with the sex acts that Bill moves through.

 










What was the atmosphere and anticipation like for that scene for everyone on set, even for those who weren't necessarily going to be in it? It still must have hung over the movie like this fascinating inevitability.

Yes, as the orgy was saved til almost the end of the shoot. When I returned to finish up in January '98, Stanley had Leon Vitali show me those dailies, and I remember thinking how that sequence had been lurking since '96, and now here it was — just playing on his Steenbeck.

How immersive was this approximation of New York City that Kubrick created? To me, it's like an ethereal, dreamy otherworld version of New York, though critics at the time said it was unrealistic.

Stanley had every inch of the West Village meticulously photographed as it was at that time. In fact, our eldest daughter and her husband once lived above the reference he used for Rainbow Fashions. However, the reality was simply a baseline from which to depart. If you look at the street names in the film, they're of birds, not MacDougal and 8th. For Stanley, those roads weren't in Manhattan; they were inside the Schnitzler novella and Jung's “Individuation in Fairytales.”

Was your interpretation of the film's reception at the time that it was positive? The film had its champions, and while many reviews were negative, it just seemed the response was so all over the map.
 










Oh, I think we all expected it to be negative. From “2001” on, his films were poorly received and only later reassessed in an appreciative light.

What was Tom Cruise like on-set and between takes, seeing as he spends most of your screen time with you? Did you have any interaction with Nicole Kidman, or were you mostly siloed and on site for your scenes only?

It was an intimate set, and except for one or two scenes, a night shoot. We started in October '96 at Ziegler's party. That's when I first met Tom and Nic. They showed up as actors, not movie stars, and were warm and welcoming. After that sequence, the rest of my work was with Tom in December '96, October/November '97, and finally January '98. I've told this story before, but I wouldn't have made “In the Bedroom” without Tom's encouragement, and that lasted through post.

Also, what were your piano skills like then… and now? 

My piano skills were those of a trombone player. I knew the keyboard, could pluck out the chart and learn it by rote. To prepare, I worked with the great jazz pianist Eric Reed, who I met through my friend Ben Wolfe. In fact, it was Ben's idea for the player intro at the end at the Sonata Café.  I worked my ass off for that scene, but Stanley never really showed my hands.

 










That was frustrating, considering we shot this after Ziegler's, where one day Stanley sat down on the piano bench next to me and said, “I wonder why it's so hard for you? I mean, Cornel Wilde wasn't a pianist, and he did it so well in ‘A Song to Remember.'” To which I replied, “Yes, Stanley, but Cornel Wilde didn't have to play a four-handed piano part.” He loved to needle me. All the extras were friends, and Stanley would drag them up to the bandstand and say things like, “Jimmy here is a professional pianist and doesn't think your feet look right on the pedals.”

But we have a piano at home that I play. And in a way, I'm guilty of the same crime in “TÁR,” as I never once showed Cate's hands on that Steinway in the Juilliard scene.

The Criterion Collection 4K release of “Eyes Wide Shut” is now available.

Glen Powell continues his bid for leading-man status — with Edgar Wright's “The Running Man” now in theaters, a first-ever “Saturday Night Live” hosting stint in the bag, and now a new film early next year. “How to Make a Killing,” formerly titled “Huntington,” has released its first trailer. Powell stars as a man who is tasked with offing his family in order to secure his inheritance. A24 distributes the film, produced by StudioCanal and Blueprint.

It's also directed by John Patton Ford, directing his second feature after 2022's sleeper favorite “Emily the Criminal,” starring Aubrey Plaza. That movie earned four nominations at the 38th Independent Spirit Awards, including Best First Feature, with Ford winning the Best First Screenplay prize.

Here's the official synopsis for “How to Make a Killing”: “Disowned at birth by his obscenely wealthy family, blue-collar Becket Redfellow (Glen Powell) will stop at nothing to reclaim his inheritance, no matter how many relatives stand in his way.”

 










The cast also includes Margaret Qualley, Ed Harris, Topher Grace, Jessica Henwick, Bill Camp, and more. Ford's screenplay for the film was originally on the 2014 Black List, with Jon S. Baird then attached to direct the film with a different cast. However, Ford took over directing duties on the film in 2023, with Powell then cast the following year. The movie was shot in Cape Town, where the production employed South African cast, crew, and extras.

The trailer released on November 25 marks the reveal of the film's new title, “How to Make a Killing.”

What Patton Ford told IndieWire at Sundance 2022 about “Emily the Criminal” might as well apply to this film, which is about taking back the rules: “I can tell you that when I was writing the script, I was at a point in my life where I felt like I had done everything ‘right,' technically. I had always been a good student, never got in trouble, went to school, graduated. And I felt like I had been misled. “I felt like I had followed the rules. And then you reach a point where you realize ‘oh, the rules were written by someone who just wants to profit from me. They weren't written for me.'”

A24 releases “How to Make a Killing” in theaters Friday, February 20, 2026. Check out the film's first trailer below.

	Here's your first look at How To Make A Killing starring Glen Powell.


	The film is directed by John Patton Ford (Emily the Criminal). Starring Alongside Powell are Margaret Qualley, Ed Harris, Jessica Henwick, Zach Woods, Topher Grace, and Raff Law. 


	The plot follows Becket Redfellow, the son of Mary, an heiress to the vast Redfellow estate, but who was disowned by the family when Becket was born. 


	The official synopsis reads: When she passes away, impoverished and alone, Becket decides to make good on her belief that he is destined for greatness, no matter how evil he might need to be to achieve it. Ruthlessly determined to get back what Mary always said was stolen from him, Becket hatches a murderous scheme to eliminate the seven Redfellow relatives who stand between him and his inheritance. Can money buy happiness? As the heirs fall one by one, in a series of deliciously imaginative accidents, Becket is pretty sure it can. But he must also navigate his relationship with his loving girlfriend, Ruth, for whom money means nothing, and the increasing attentions of Julia, a flirtatious old flame from the past, for whom it most definitely does.

The 25th anniversary celebration of the singer's "My Kind of Christmas" album will have a limited run in theaters in the U.S. on Dec. 14 and 21.

Christina Aguilera counts down a few of her favorite things in the latest teaser video for the singer's upcoming international holiday spectacular. “‘My Favorite Things‘ — the first single from my upcoming Christmas special, recorded live from the Eiffel Tower — arrives tomorrow,” Xtina wrote on Monday (Nov. 24) of the first taste of music from Christina Aguilera: Christmas in Paris.

	The clip finds Aguilera singing the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic from The Sound of Music while sporting a blonde bombshell look accented by black sheer gloves and a sparkling white bustier festooned with ribbons of pearls. The video also features cameos from ballerinas and an orchestra backing the singer as she belts out the tune made famous by Julie Andrews with the Eiffel Tower visible in the background.

	











	The special marking the 25th anniversary of Aguilera's beloved My Kind of Christmas holiday album was directed by Emmy-winner Sam Wrench (Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour) and shot in Paris in front of an intimate audience of 250, transporting viewers to a winter-garden terrace above the Musée du Quai Branly.




	“Against the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower – fashioned into a shimmering Christmas tree – Aguilera delivers an immersive performance with the city skyline as both stage and witness,” reads a description of the special. “As twilight deepens, she moves fluidly through holiday classics and career-defining hits, all captured in a sumptuous vintage-lens glow. Between songs, the film drifts into dreamlike Parisian interludes – where Christina contemplates love, motherhood, reinvention, and the artistry that has defined her journey.”


	The film will also feature documentary footage shot around Paris, as well as footage from inside the iconic Crazy Horse cabaret, culminating in the snowy grand finale in front of the Eiffel Tower. Aguilera has been posting teasers for the special over the past week, including one in which she traipses around the base of the Tower while wearing a flowing blonde wig and sparkly party dress cued to Frank Sinatra's “The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower.”


Christmas in Paris will screen in theaters in the U.S. on Dec. 14 and 21.

James Cameron is not known for his bedside manner, and after years of telling Christopher Nolan, Marvel movies, and Roland Emmerich exactly what he thinks of them, he's turned his critical eye to Netflix. In a new interview with The Town‘s Matt Belloni (via World Of Reel), Cameron offered some words of encouragement toward Netflix's theatrical strategy: It's “rotten to the core,” and the movies they produce shouldn't be allowed within 10 feet of an Oscar statuette unless they get a release in “2,000 theaters for a month.” Yeesh, Jim, tell 'em how you really feel.

The topic arose as Belloni asked Cameron about reports of Netflix and Paramount's recent bids to buy Warner Bros. Cameron gave his recommendation to Paramount because “Netflix would be a disaster. Sorry, Ted [Sarandos], but geez. Sarandos has gone on the record saying theatrical films are dead. ‘Theatrical is dead. Quote, unquote.'” When Belloni told Cameron that Sarandos was “promising theaters if he buys Warner Bros.,” Cameron replied: “It's sucker bait. ‘We'll put the movie out for a week or 10 days. We'll qualify for Oscar consideration.' See, I think that's fundamentally rotten to the core. A movie should be made as a movie for theatrical, and the Academy Awards mean nothing to me if they don't mean theatrical. I think they've been co-opted, and I think it's horrific.”

Cameron is obviously not a fan of Netflix's minimal theatrical releases for its latest host of Oscar contenders, like Frankenstein, Jay Kelly, and House Of Dynamite, which were given two-week limited runs in a handful of theaters. He's not the first to criticize this strategy either, since the streamer only instituted it so its movies would be eligible for awards, and, well, stars and filmmakers want their films in theaters. In 2019, Steven Spielberg lobbed the same criticism at Netflix. “Once you commit to a television format, you're a TV movie,” Spielberg said. “You certainly, if it's a good show, deserve an Emmy, but not an Oscar. I don't believe films that are just given token qualifications in a couple of theaters for less than a week should qualify for the Academy Award nomination.”

Cameron offers Netflix a path forward on the Oscar nominations, though: “They should be allowed to compete if they put the movie out for a meaningful release in 2,000 theaters for a month.”

The ‘Hairspray' director's latest movie for Bleecker Street and World of Wonder is called ‘STOP! THAT! TRAIN!'


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


Adam Shankman's camp action comedy starring RuPaul Charles has been titled STOP! THAT! TRAIN! ahead of a North American theatrical release set for May 29, 2026 by Bleecker Street.


	The drag queen disaster movie draws on the RuPaul's Drag Race universe through franchise producer World of Wonder and also stars Ginger Minj, Jujubee, Brooke Lynn Hytes, Latrice Royale, Marcia Marcia Marcia, Monét X Change and Symone. 




	Bleecker Street earlier nabbed the North American rights to the comedy feature from director Shankman that centers on camp drag queens on a chaotic high-speed train journey. Universal Pictures Content Group will handle the international rights to the RuPaul-led feature that has wrapped production in Los Angeles.

	A synopsis from the producers reads: “STOP! THAT! TRAIN! follows best friends Tess (Minj) and DeeDee (Jujubee), train stewardesses who trade their dreary shifts on the Stank Rail for the glitzy Glamazonian Express. When a catastrophic ‘Stormganza' threatens to derail the high-speed train, the duo join forces with the snobby first class attendants and President Gagwell (RuPaul) to save the day in this wild ride of camp and comedy.”

	Lynn Hytes, Marcia Marcia Marcia and Symone play first class train attendants in the theatrical film that expands the storytelling universe for the long-running MTV drag queen competition series. 

	











	“I've had the greatest time shooting STOP! THAT! TRAIN! with some of the most hilarious and game people out there, and we can't wait to bring it to audiences nationwide next May,” Shankman said in a statement. “I know I've needed to laugh now more than ever, and if you're not howling during this one, I'm pretty sure you're made of coal and possibly a descendant of the Grinch family!”


	Connor Wright and Christina Friel penned the script for the action comedy. Unapologetic Projects is financing and executive producing the project, with Fenton Bailey, Randy Barbato, Tom Campbell, RuPaul Charles and Shankman sharing the producer credits.

Defunding the police may be a policy that scares Democrats, but the 16th precinct has no problem with hacking the police budget. After 25 years on the force, Ice-T has been noticeably absent from the 27th season of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Talking to TMZ, Ice-T explains that he only appears in four of the season's eight episodes because the show can't afford both him and the returning Kelli Giddish. “It's just basically business,” he says. “They brought Kelli back. At the end of the day, they couldn't keep both of us on both times, as far as budget-wise.” Giddish's character, Detective Amanda Rollins, had been written off in season 24, but star Mariska Hargitay fought for her return, and Detective Benson gets what she wants.

Ice-T says that producers told him, “We'll have you come in and out this year” because “everybody wanted Kelli back” and the show hired “new cops.” Rest assured, he's not leaving the show.”I am more concerned with going to Season 28,” he continues. “This year, they said, ‘Ice, we're going to work you a little less.' Everything was cool with me. I understood. I said, ‘Are you getting rid of me?' They said, ‘No way. We can't imagine Law & Order without you.'”

“I am not going to say anything negative about this show,” Ice-T continues. “They have taken care of me for so long. I'm trying to get to Season 28 […] Don't worry about me. I am kind of glad the fans are upset. What if I was missing and nobody cared?”

Considering how many seasons of this show have been on the air and the number of spin-offs it has generated, we were under the impression that Dick Wolf's productions were immune to these sorts of machinations, especially regarding one of the show's most recognizable stars. Then again, this is also the shortest season in the show's 27-year run, reducing the number of episodes from 22 to eight. That's what defunding the police looks like.

Boy Harsher, the darkwave electronic duo of vocalist Jae Matthews and producer Augustus Muller, are shooting a feature film with Chloë Sevigny in the starring role, and they've tapped a few striking musicians to join the cast. The movie, dubbed The Lonely Woman, stars FKA twigs, Sturgill Simpson, Will Oldham (aka Bonnie “Prince” Billy), and Jake Weary, among others. News of the casting was first reported by Deadline.

The Lonely Woman is billed as “a bleak, sensual, and atmospheric horror-thriller” featuring a score by Boy Harsher themselves. Hunter Zimny is the movie's director of photography, while Madeline Sadowski (who's worked on Good Time and Chappell Roan's “The Subway” video) is the production designer.

The Lonely Woman is set in rural New England and follows a woman who was marked by the death of her first love in a mountain tunnel. As she's drawn into the mystery of a new disappearance, she begins confronting a seductive and terrifying presence buried beneath the town.

This isn't Boy Harsher's first foray into the world of cinema. The duo penned the soundtrack to the 2022 short film The Runner, and green-lit the song “Pain” to appear in Terrifier 2, too. The Lonely Woman, however, marks Boy Harsher's first time directing a movie. Their most recent full-length album, Careful, came out in 2019.

A few days ago, FKA twigs released EUSEXUA Afterglow, a new album paired with a reimagined version of her third studio album, EUSEXUA, from this past January. It includes the singles “Cheap Hotel” and “Hard.” Revisit Madison Bloom's column “Hard Beats, Bondage, and Body Paint: What Went Down at FKA twigs' New York Eusexua Rave.”

It's been a monumental year in the life of Hallmark star Ben Rosenbaum, who's stepped into two major new roles in 2025. First, he became a husband in June, marrying his real-life leading lady and “When Calls the Heart” co-star Erin Krakow, to the delight of Hearties everywhere. Second, Rosenbaum filmed his first movie as a Hallmark leading man, “The Christmas Cup” — also to the delight of Hearties everywhere. 

Chatting with EntertainmentNow ahead of his film's November 30th premiere, Rosenbaum beamed about both experiences, calling his wedding “a great day in my life” and his starring role an opportunity he feels “super lucky” for. 

In “The Christmas Cup,” Rosenbaum stars opposite longtime Hallmark star Rhiannon Fish, who plays Staff Sergeant Kelly Brandt, a Marine sidelined at home by a knee injury. As she bides her time by leading her hometown team in the annual Christmas Cup, she receives help — and a new perspective on life — from Rosenbaum's character, Fire Captain Quinn Stokley. 

Rosenbaum, who has played Mike Hickam on WCTH since the show began in 2014, first revealed in September that he'd be leading his first Hallmark Christmas movie. The excitement from WCTH fans since then has not gone unnoticed, Rosenbaum told EntertainmentNow. 

“Oh my goodness, yes, I am feeling the love,” he said. “And it feels great. It's really nice. For years, it feels like now, there have been fans of ‘When Calls the Heart' who have taken a particular shine to mycharacter, Hickam. I feel them lifting me up. They've been asking for this for years and I'm really excited to be able to deliver this movie for them.” 

But despite all the love coming from fans, Rosenbaum sweetly acknowledged, “There's no bigger cheerleader for me than my wife.” 

Just as Krakow is Rosenbaum's biggest fan, he told EntertainmentNow he was smitten with Krakow's gifts as an actress from the first time they worked together in 2009. 

“Honestly, when Erin and I first met, I actually saw her working the first time we met, and really just developed a crush on her talent,” Rosenbaum said. “She's just so good on stage and on screen.” 

The couple first connected at the renowned Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, where Rosenbaum was born and raised. Krakow was cast as Cecily in “The Importance of Being Earnest” and he was an understudy for the characters of Algernon and Jack.  

The two became friends during the production, Rosenbaum said, “and then shortly thereafter, after production ended and she went back to New York, I was doing a national tour that started and ended in New York. So we had more opportunities to connect, and a romance developed from there.”



Krakow, who stars as Elizabeth Thornton on WCTH, has also starred in her fair share of Hallmark movies, including 2025's highly anticipated holiday flick “Christmas Above the Clouds” opposite Tyler Hynes. 

Rosenbaum laughed at the idea of competing with his wife in the Hallmark ratings now that he, too, is leading a Christmas movie. 

“I'd rather stay away from any competition with her,” he chuckled. “In that regard, I'll very gladly take a little step back from that competition and hand her her flowers!” 

As for whether the two might collaborate on a future movie, Rosenbaum told EntertainmentNow, “I think that would be really fun.” 

“The Christmas Cup” premieres on November 30 at 6 p.m. Eastern time and the 13th season of “When Calls The Heart” premieres on January 4, 2026. 

I love them both in WCTH, an I was so happy to see they got married in real life.  Can't wait for the new season to start.

With few options remaining for the beleaguered Exorcist producers still wandering around Hollywood muttering, “The power of Christ compels you,” Scarlett Johansson has stepped up to foster yet another creatively diminished franchise. As she did for Jurassic World, Johansson will star in the latest reboot of William Friedkin's The Exorcist. Unlike Exorcist: Believer, this latest exorcism will be led by director Mike Flanagan, who promises a “radical new take” on the film, per Variety.

Despite the disappointment of David Gordon Green's Exorcist: Believer, which was initially poised to anchor an entire Exorcist trilogy, the series remains of the utmost concern to Universal. Lest we forget, the studio shelled out $400 million for the rights to the film series in hopes of turning them into Peacock exclusives. When announced, Green had been riding high on the diminishing returns of his Halloween trilogy, but the underwhelming response to Believer led to his stepping down from its first sequel, Exorcist: Deceiver. Alas, we'll never know what he was going to do with Exorcist: Retriever, presumably the first movie in the franchise to feature a possessed dog. Still, with The Conjuring couple eating Exorcist‘s lunch for the last decade at the box office, Universal and Blumhouse are itching to get a taste of that sweet, demonically possessed pie.

As noted, the next movie will come from the heart and mind of Mike Flanagan, returning to horror after his whimsical drama, The Life Of Chuck, failed to make an impression on audiences. (The A.V. Club wasn't impressed with the film's “insipid sentimentality” either). “The Exorcist is one of the reasons I became a filmmaker,” Flanagan said. However, the director is currently working on another remake of a 70s horror classic about a magically disturbed girl, Carrie. After he adapts Stephen King's novel into a Prime Video miniseries, he can focus on whatever Regan is spinning her head about these days.

Talk about a head-spinning role! 

Scarlett Johansson is set to lead a “radical new take” on “The Exorcist” in an upcoming film.

The film will tell an all-new story set in “The Exorcist” universe, and is not a sequel to the 2023 entry, “The Exorcist: Believer,” which starred Leslie Odom Jr.

The original “Exorcist,” released in 1973, followed Ellen Burstyn's Chris MacNeil as she sought two priests to perform an exorcism on her possessed tween daughter, played by Linda Blair.

It was a hit with audiences and critics alike, earning $441 million at the box office and garnering two Academy Awards.

The latest version is coming from Jason Blum and James Wan's merged horror heavy hitter Blumhouse-Atomic Monster as well Morgan Creek (which has been behind four previous “Exorcist” films) and Hollywood studio Universal.

Acclaimed horror filmmaker Mike Flanagan — who's behind TV hits like “The Haunting of Hill House” and “Midnight Mass” — will direct the new film, set to shoot in New York City. 

Flanagan will also soon breathe new life into another gruesome classic: He recently wrapped production on Amazon MGM Studios' TV adaptation of Stephen King's iconic debut novel, “Carrie.”

“Scarlett is a brilliant actress whose captivating performances always feel grounded and real, from genre films to summer blockbusters, and I couldn't be happier to have her join this ‘Exorcist' film,” Flanagan said in a statement.

It's no surprise that Universal would be eager to re-team with Johansson, who recently toplined “Jurassic World Rebirth” for the studio. The film earned over $850 million at the global box office, becoming one of the year's highest-grossing movies.

Johansson remains one of today's most in-demand stars, juggling prestige projects and blockbuster fare. Her films have grossed over $15.4 billion at the global box office, making her the highest-grossing lead actress of all time.

Flanagan will write and direct the new horror take via his Red Room Pictures banner, with Alexandra Magistro as executive producer. David Robinson produces for Morgan Creek, while horror maestro Blum and Ryan Turek will produce and executive produce for Blumhouse-Atomic Monster.

Johansson is represented by CAA, Yorn Levine LLC and True Public Relations. Flanagan is represented by WME, VanderKloot Law and Bespoke Publicity. Deadline was first to report the news.

Uzi joins Jay-Z and Rihanna as the only artists signed to ROC Nation Distribution and also managed by Roc Nation.


													By
												

	Michael Saponara



	It's a new era for Lil Uzi Vert. The Philly rapper is no longer signed to Atlantic, and Uzi returned on Monday (Nov. 24) to release a pair of singles independently with “Chanel Boy” and “Relevant.”


	The 31-year-old joins Rihanna and Jay-Z as the only two artists both signed to ROC Nation Distribution and managed by Roc Nation.

	











	“UZI is a global icon and a dynamic force in the music industry, so we're thrilled to work together with them in this new capacity,” said ROC Nation Distribution President Krystian Santini in a statement. “Our partnership is centered around empowering UZI to continue building their legacy, with full creative control and the resources to take their artistry to new heights.”


	“Relevant” hit streaming services around 9 p.m. ET on Monday evening, as the second of two releases from Uzi today. Trillion and Rima helm the chaotic production as Uzi stamps their relevancy never fading in the game. Lil Uzi also released a sharp visual to accompany the single, which finds the rapper laced in red bandanas and Balenciaga Boots. 


	As for “Chanel Boy,” the first of Uzi's two-pack arrived Monday morning. The galactic track feels like a return to the Eternal Atake era for Uzi as they dive head-first into the synth-filled ZeeGoinXrazy production.

	











	The French designer could use “Chanel Boy” to soundtrack its next campaign, as Uzi raves about being draped in the double C's. “Chanel on my feet, Chanel when I geek/ Chanel on the beach, Chanel on the beach/ Everyday of the week, I know Chanaynay ain't cheap,” Uzi raps on the chorus.


	A gritty video also arrived alongside “Chanel Boy,” which follows Uzi's travels around a night in the Big Apple. The Philly native flexes their Chanel threads and hops out of a chopper and into a Black SUV for a ride to the studio.


	Lil Uzi Vert's last album as part of their deal with Atlantic Records was Eternal Atake 2 in November 2024, which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200.


	The next chapter of Lil Uzi Vert has begun. Listen to “Chanel Boy” and “Relevant” below.

I
n the spring of 2022, Jim Doherty kept having the same conversation with folks at the only grocery store in Boardman, his eastern Oregon hometown, or at the grain depot where he picked up food for his four ranch dogs. Healthy adults that these people knew were coming down with unexplained medical conditions, including diseases and cancers that usually afflicted the elderly. “It was kinda grim,” Doherty says.


	Sixty years old, broad-chested, with a salt-and-pepper goatee, Doherty had been running a cattle ranch business with his wife for 25 years when he entered public service in 2016, winning a seat on Morrow County's three-person board of commissioners.


	What stood out about those conversations was the way people connected them to a problem with water in the area. Doherty knew what they meant: The county's underground water supply had been tainted with nitrates — a byproduct of chemical fertilizers used by the megafarms and food processing plants where most of his constituents worked.

	











	The aquifer underneath Morrow County, known as the Lower Umatilla Basin, is the only source of water for as many as 45,000 residents in and around the county, the majority of whom rely on private wells that draw on the basin. Since 1991, regulators at the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) have been collecting samples from the aquifer that show a slow and steady increase of chemical toxins in the water.


	Water hadn't really been a political priority for Doherty — he's a Republican, and he focused mostly on economic development and transportation projects — until a couple of years into his second term, when the uptick of stories he heard about young women enduring miscarriages and middle-aged men with organ failure started making him uneasy. Scientists believe that excess consumption of even a small amount of nitrates can do significant harm to the human body; they can cause debilitating conditions in newborns and have been linked to increased risks of cancer. Doherty wasn't familiar with the research at the time, but he wondered if there was a connection between the contamination in the water and those conversations he kept having.

	In June 2022, he decided to do something about it. He went out and collected tap water samples from six homes he chose at random and sent them to a nearby laboratory. The lab called a few days later and explained that it was their policy to notify anyone with a sample that tested above the federal limit for the presence of nitrates in drinking water — 10 parts per million.


	Doherty asked which family was going to receive the bad news about their water. But the lab tech corrected him. It wasn't one of the homes he visited that had a toxic well. It was all six. Doherty says he picked up 70 more test kits and went back out a week later, this time knocking on doors across a wider swath of the county. The results were equally bleak. Of the 70 wells he tested, 68 violated the safety threshold, with an average concentration of nitrates close to four times the federal limit. 


	When Doherty collected the water samples, accompanied by an official with the county health office, they'd taken an informal survey. Talking mostly to farmhands and factory workers who were reliant on well water, they asked if anyone in their household had one or more of the known medical conditions linked to nitrate exposure. According to Doherty, within the first 30 homes they visited, they heard of at least 25 miscarriages and a half dozen people living with one kidney. “One man about 60 years old had his voice box taken out because of a cancer that only smokers get,” Doherty says, “but that guy hadn't smoked a day of his life.”


	It never occurred to Doherty that his effort to fix the water problem would provoke the ire of a group of local officials who resented scrutiny of their role in the pollution. That it would end his political career, tank his cattle sales, and cause him so much stress he'd lose 50 pounds. He couldn't have foreseen the multibillion-dollar political scandal submerged in that fouled water, the class action lawsuit that would rise from it, the intervention by the Oregon governor and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a civil suit from the Oregon attorney general, or sanctions from the state's ethics commission and Department of Environmental Quality. He never thought parents in the area would be terrified that their children might sneak a glass of poisonous water from the kitchen sink. And he never imagined that one of the world's largest tech companies — Amazon — could play a part in the crisis.

	“The historical precedent here is Flint, Michigan,” says Kristin Ostrom, executive director of Oregon Rural Action (ORA), a water rights advocacy group. “In part because of how slow the response to the crisis has been, and in part because of who's affected. These are people who have no political or economic power, and very little knowledge of the risk.”


	AMAZON OPENED MORROW COUNTY'S first “hyperscale” data center in 2011 — nearly 10,000 square feet of warehouse space filled with rows of computer servers. The facility services the company's most profitable division, its cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon's presence lent Big Tech cachet to the county's industrial district and diversified its investment portfolio away from a reliance on agriculture. Amazon has generated commercial taxes for the county worth more than $100 million over the course of a decade.


	Eager to compete with other rural communities looking to host data center campuses, local officials had offered Amazon a 15-year tax abatement for each hyperscale data center it built, which would be worth billions to the company. Amazon has since constructed seven such facilities in the area, with agreements for five more underway.


	There was good reason for Amazon to set itself up in a place like Morrow County. With $107 billion in cloud computing sales in 2024, Amazon Web Services has the dominant position with 30 percent of the market. But the company faces stiff competition from Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and Google. In the third quarter of 2024, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft increased their investment in data centers 81 percent compared to the previous year, per the telecom market researcher Dell'Oro Group, and have already spent $360 billion on capital expenditures over the past 12 months. S&P predicts that demand for new construction is expected to double by 2030, most of it in rural counties like Morrow that are otherwise reliant on agriculture. Around the country, and the world, there is a land race among the big tech companies for sites for their data centers. The stakes of the game are high: A recent Goldman Sachs analysis found AI technology could unlock as much as $5 trillion to $19 trillion for the American economy.

	











	But data centers pose a variety of climate and environmental problems, including their impact on the water supply. The volume of water needed to cool the servers in data centers — most of which need to be kept at 70 to 80 degrees to run effectively — has become a nationwide water resource issue particularly in areas facing water scarcity across the West. This year, a Bloomberg News analysis found that roughly “two-thirds of new data centers built or in development since 2022 are in places already gripped by high levels of water stress.” Droughts have plagued Morrow County, occurring annually since 2020. But even areas with ample water reserves are vulnerable to the outsized demand from data centers. Earlier this year, the International Energy Agency reported that data centers could consume 1,200 billion liters by 2030 worldwide, nearly double the 560 billion liters of water they use currently. 


	The volume of water isn't the most pressing problem in Morrow County, however. The issue is pollution, which Amazon's data centers have exacerbated since their arrival.


	In response to a request for comment, Amazon spokesperson Lisa Levandowski replied that “the apparent narrative” of this story “is misleading and inaccurate.” Levandowski went on to say: “The truth is that this region has long-documented groundwater quality challenges that significantly predate AWS' presence, and federal, state, and local agencies have spent years working to address nitrates from agricultural fertilizer, manure, septic systems, and wastewater from food processing plants. Our data centers draw water from the same supply as other community members; nitrates are not an additive we use in any of our processes, and the volume of water our facilities use and return represents only a very small fraction of the overall water system — not enough to have any meaningful impact on water quality.” 

“One man about 60 years old had his voice box taken out because of a cancer only smokers get, but that guy hadn't smoked a day of his life.”


	Morrow is an unlikely location for an agricultural juggernaut. Essentially desert country, its porous, sandy soil is inhospitable to all but a few types of shallow-root crops. Yet over the past few decades, it was transformed by a group of entrepreneurial local officials and farm operators who leveraged chemical fertilizers to make the desert bloom.


	To compensate for the dry conditions and create more capacity for large agricultural operations, vast irrigation systems were built in the 1990s by officials at the Port of Morrow, the county's transportation and food-processing hub along the bank of the Columbia River. Increased water flow meant large agricultural companies could use fertilizers in fields year-round. That drew some of the Pacific Northwest's largest dairy concerns and producers of onions and potatoes to Morrow County. Lamb Weston, which supplies virtually all of the potatoes for McDonald's french fries, set up shop. So did Threemile Canyon Farms, one of the largest dairy operators in the nation.


	The massive inputs of fertilizer to grow crops and feed for the animals came at a price: the contamination of the Lower Umatilla Basin. In 1992, DEQ measured an average nitrate concentration of 9.2 ppm across a cluster of wells pulling from the basin. By 2015, that average had risen 46 percent, to 15.3 ppm. For some wells, DEQ found nitrate levels nearly as high as 73 ppm, more than 10 times the state limit of 7 ppm.


	Every day, the megafarms and food processing plants in Morrow County send millions of gallons of wastewater to the Port of Morrow. The Port in turn pumps it to one of several lagoons that hold tens or hundreds of millions of gallons of tainted water. Vast pools of this wastewater are covered in football field-sized tarps, which trap the solids that rise to the surface. Microbes metabolize some of the solids, expelling methane gas which then burns out of thin chimney pipes sticking up from the tarps, the flames flickering atop like birthday candles. Once the solid waste has burned off, the water under the tarp is laden with residual nitrogen chemicals — the remains of the fertilizers, animal manure, and plant material. At no cost to farm operators, the Port then pumps that nitrogen-dense water back out onto the farms, where nitrogen turns into nitrates when it interacts with the soil. It is a novel recycling process that alleviates the Port's wastewater burden and offers farms a steady flow of highly concentrated fertilized water to expand their industrial-ag footprints.

	











	When the Port sprays that water back over the farms, some of the nitrates are absorbed by the crops, but there's a limit to how much the sandy soil and shallow-root plants can hold before it leaks all the way through the dirt, polluting the aquifer below. “The aquifer is basically one giant sandbox, and the water flows through there very quickly,” says Chad Gubala, a hydrologist who managed Oregon DEQ's oversight of the Port of Morrow's wastewater permit from 2018 to 2022. Once the crops have absorbed what they can, the rest of the nitrates “get flushed right through [to the basin].”


	Experts say Amazon's arrival supercharged this process. The data centers suck up tens of millions of gallons of water from the aquifer each year to cool their computer equipment, which then gets funneled to the Port's wastewater system. All of the data center water gets mixed into the dirty lagoon wastewater, which only increases how much water the Port must then discard over the fields. As Greg Pettit, who served at the DEQ for 38 years and led the development of Oregon's Groundwater Quality, explains, “the more water you put on, the faster you're going to drive the nitrogen through the soil and down into the aquifer.” 


	Gubula is likewise critical of how the Port historically has dealt with the overwhelming volume of wastewater, which included spraying the fields during the cold winter months, even when no crops were planted. “This idea of winter irrigation was the goofiest thing on God's green earth,” he says. “The farmers and the Port facility folks argued that maintaining irrigation during a non-growing season was a reasonable thing to keep the soil ‘in appropriate condition' they called it, so it'd be ready for spring seed sowing and early growth. Well, it was functionally a load of shit, a way to maintain year-round discharge of wastewater from their facilities.” (In an Oct. 30 press release, the Port pledged to end the practice this winter. The Port's executive director, Lisa Mittelsdorf, told Rolling Stone in a statement, “The Port and DEQ have worked together to ban non-growing season land application of industrial wastewater.”)


	The nonstop spraying during the winter months helped the Port and Amazon manage the incredible volume of wastewater coming out of the farms and data centers, but it raised alarm bells for DEQ rank-and-file analysts. The winter irrigation practice “provides a significant risk to … to groundwater,” Larry Brown, a DEQ environmental health specialist, wrote in an email in 2023, summarizing concerns he had shared with DEQ administrators a year earlier. “[It] must be phased out as soon as reasonably possible.” The warning signs were ignored.

	











	As the underground aquifer became tainted with more nitrates, even the ostensibly clean water that the Port pulled from the aquifer's deepest wells — which it used to service its large industrial customers like Amazon — became polluted. Soon, Amazon was using water to cool its data warehouses with nitrates as high as 13 ppm — above the federal and state limits.


	When that tainted water moves through the data centers to absorb heat from the server systems, some of the water is evaporated, but the nitrates remain, increasing the concentration. That means that when the polluted water has moved through the data centers and back into the wastewater system, it's even more contaminated, sometimes averaging as high as 56 ppm, eight times Oregon's safety limit.


	ON JUNE 9, 2022, JIM DOHERTY called a public hearing for the county commission to vote on a state of emergency for the county's drinking water. As word spread about the meeting, some residents were angry — and not necessarily about the health threat. Many feared an emergency declaration would expose the county to intervention by the Oregon DEQ or the federal Environmental Protection Agency, whose regulators might shut down businesses to halt the contamination.

“The historical precedent here is Flint, Michigan, in part because of who's affected. These are people with no political or economic power and little knowledge of the risk.”


	Local residents and farm managers packed the hearing at the county courthouse in the town of Heppner, with dozens more watching the livestream. “Our legacy will be what we are doing now,” Doherty said of the emergency decree. The county, he argued, needed to unlock emergency funds to buy bottled water for anyone living with tainted wells and provide test kits to the thousands of residents who didn't yet know if they were drinking polluted water.


	Melissa Lindsay was one of Doherty's fellow county commissioners, elected the same year as him. She said she had reservations about the state of emergency, because it would mean giving broad authority to the governor over resource allocation, emergency services, and communication about the crisis to the public. Doherty disagreed. He had received a phone call from then-Gov. Kate Brown a few days earlier, and she'd offered emergency assistance without strings attached. “She did not say they would come run our county,” Doherty said.

	











	That was enough for Lindsay, but not everyone at the meeting was swayed. The agricultural operators who accounted for the $2 billion local economy remained wary. Doherty says one farm manager spent 15 minutes at a second meeting telling him “what a godawful person I was for trying to shut down farming and the local ag industry.”


	The tensions laid bare the economic realities of Morrow County, a place where the gap between rich and poor is extreme. Roughly 30 percent of the county lives in mobile homes — the vast majority of which rely on well water — and 40 percent live below the poverty line. Meanwhile, the top five percent earn an average income of $374,000, more than 20 times the bottom 20 percent. These farm managers and factory executives tend to live in McMansions scattered around the countryside or in manicured developments in Boardman. In sharp contrast to the potholed gravel roads and slanted bungalows where the workers live, the new developments have freshly paved streets and sidewalks, and they drink and cook with water from city water pipes that go deep into the aquifer, where the water is less concentrated with nitrates — although the contamination levels for even the deepest wells are starting to rise.


	At the end of the June 9 meeting, commissioner Lindsay endorsed the declaration — a move that would free up county funds for bottled water and prompt the state to open up its own emergency response coffers. “The safe drinking water of our constituents is  number one,” Lindsay said. Her vote, along with Doherty's, was enough. The third commissioner, Don Russell, who had worked at the Port before winning a seat on the county board, did not show up to the emergency hearing.


	With the initial $250,000 in emergency funds, the county hired water trucks for well users to fill large jugs. Health officials began distributing bilingual flyers that warned wells could be tainted, advising that “residents who have a high level of nitrate in their well water should not boil their water. Boiling does not get rid of nitrate.” By the end of the summer, the county had spent $500,000 addressing the water problem, including additional deliveries of bottled water to residents' homes. Despite the concern about the state's involvement, the county received little help from state agencies and lawmakers.


	Doherty was particularly upset that Gov. Brown didn't release a statement supporting the county. He pressured her office about the $4 million in emergency funds he'd requested, but the county only received $881,000 from the state for testing and home water-filtration kits. Doherty suspected that the lobbyists representing Morrow County business interests were working behind the scenes to thwart an aggressive state-level intervention. “That was the mafia mentality at work,” he says. “‘We're going to take care of it, don't you worry about it. Just keep it in the family.'” (Former Gov. Brown declined to directly address these allegations, instead suggesting Rolling Stone file a public records request.)


	Other state agencies seemed to fall in line with farm operators' assertion that this wasn't much of an emergency, and if it was, the burden of solving the problem lay with the agriculture industry and not the state. “[To] move the needle on reducing contamination to healthy levels … it's going to take work and creative solutions from farmers, ranchers, homeowners, really anyone who uses water or land in this area,” a DEQ spokesperson said that June.

	











	By September 2022, 248 additional homes had been found to have nitrate levels above the state's safety limit. At another packed town hall meeting, “county leaders and people with contaminated wells expressed growing frustration at the lack of direct intervention from the state in public testimony,” one local newspaper wrote in its coverage. Despite several invitations, Gov. Brown did not attend, nor did any representatives from DEQ or Oregon Health Authority.


	Speaking to the crowd, Doherty emphasized the significance of raising awareness among the worker enclaves. Some immigrants in the area, many of whom are undocumented, were reluctant to seek help. According to several sources with direct knowledge of the incidents, managers at several of the food processing plants and farm operations were telling employees that the emergency declaration was a bad-faith campaign that would endanger their jobs. Gathering at town halls or speaking about the pollution to reporters was tantamount to inviting the shutdown of your place of employment. Doherty tried to counter the disinformation: “We need you. We need you to walk across the street and talk to your neighbor,” he told the crowd. “You need to talk to your friend or, better yet, make a new damn friend, tell them to test their water.”


	But as word continued to spread across the county that residents had potentially been drinking contaminated water for years, if not decades, Doherty was besieged with emails, texts, and Facebook messages from concerned residents who encouraged him to fight the pollution. “Out of the kitchen sink is the way we all get our life,” one local wrote to Doherty. “Make it right. You're the man to do it.”


	Another person contacted him who had just moved away. “My husband had kidney cancer in his early 40s. His doctor thought it was due to exposure to herbicides and pesticides. He lost a kidney but he lived,” she wrote. “We had acceptable levels of [toxins in our] drinking water when we first moved there. After my husband's cancer we realized they went up and up through the years. It's very sad.”

	











	Some of the larger agriculture operators in the area, including Tillamook Creamery and Lamb Weston, offered financial support to people who needed water. But they stopped short of acknowledging that they might have played a part in the water crisis. (Tillamook did not reply to multiple requests for comment on this story from Rolling Stone. Lamb Weston replied in a statement that “while only a very small percent of nitrates, as confirmed by the Oregon DEQ, are attributable to the land application of food processing water, we are committed to doing our part to protect safe drinking water in the region. Among other actions, we are improving water treatment to reduce the nitrogen content in our process water and taking steps to reduce water use, including the amount of process water ultimately land-applied as irrigation.”)

“[Local officials] knew from the get-go how big Amazon would become in Morrow County. They planned for it and watched it all happen.”


	The Port, which is overseen by the county, issued its own anodyne statement at the time, never conceding any role in the problem. “The Port of Morrow welcomes the County's emergency declaration on groundwater,” the statement read. “This has been a community issue for decades and it is past time to address the issue on a regional basis. The Port is eager to play its role in finding workable solutions.” Lisa Mittelsdorf, executive director of the Port, said in an email to Rolling Stone that the “DEQ has consistently acknowledged Port operations have had minimal effect on nitrate levels in the basin's groundwater.” Since 2011 Oregon DEQ has issued more than a thousand violations and more than $3 million in fines against the Port for excessive spraying of nitrate-laden water over farmland.


	Amazon pitched in money as well, “to help neighbors, families, and workers impacted by the water emergency,” as the company put it in a press release. Behind closed doors, however, members of Amazon's legal, communications, and AWS teams debated the cost of being associated with the industrial agriculture operators who, in the public imagination at least, were the cause of the pollution.


	“Is there any risk in having our name in this, or any reason why we wouldn't do this?” one staffer wrote, according to a review of hundreds of internal emails obtained through a public records request.


	“There is always potential for some risk of affiliation with the causation,” Amazon director of public policy Roger Wehner wrote, though he underscored how the company's donation would “also offer an opportunity to position AWS [as] an engaged corporate citizen doing good for the community.”

	











	Being seen as an “engaged corporate citizen” would be helpful to Amazon as it negotiated for the next round of multibillion-dollar tax abatements from Morrow County's business development committee for building out five new data centers. “This is a rare, highly impactful opportunity (could critically help influence $2b incentives) in our 2nd largest region globally. … We simply cannot miss the window given high risk/impact to the business,” AWS economic development principal Hillary Lambert wrote in the email thread.


	“Our absence … will be noted not only by the public but also very important stakeholders who 1) hold the keys to $2B of tax abatements currently in negotiation for the business 2) gate keep for key land acquisitions to meet supply needs, and 3) facilitate our permitting and water/fiber infrastructure approvals,” wrote one AWS team member. “All of which are very critical for our continued success.”


	Amazon spokesperson Lisa Levandowski characterized the use of these quotes from the emails as “misleading,” adding, “We have been investing and creating jobs in eastern Oregon since before the launch of our data centers there. Any suggestion that our support during this emergency was connected to tax negotiations or regulatory approvals misrepresents the facts — our response was driven by our commitment to the community's well-being.”


	Doherty wasn't surprised by the corporate messaging and philanthropic support by Amazon and the other major industrial players in Morrow County. It was in their interest to curry favor with the public, particularly if it meant they could avoid any commitment to altering the wastewater management practices that continued to exacerbate the crisis.


	But it wasn't just the C-suite executives who were keeping a close eye on Doherty's emergency declaration. Behind the scenes, powerful local officials were coordinating their own response.


	MORROW COUNTY'S TRANSFORMATION from a rural backwater into an agricultural powerhouse is, in many ways, the work of a single man. Gary Neal was elected general manager of the Port of Morrow in 1989, when the waterfront terminal was still a modest operation. Built in the 1960s as a rail and shipping hub to distribute the county's crops and dairy products, it had one dock and only a few food processors.


	That's where Neal came in. Over the course of more than 30 years, utilizing grants and revenue bonds to finance infrastructure investments, Neal built miles of rail track at the Port to ship exports out to the Union Pacific line. Hundreds of acres of land owned by the Port were rezoned for industrial use, hooked up to new water and waste pipes, and powered by substations installed near the Port after Neal lobbied the local utilities. Creating plug-and-play spaces for new industrial tenants allowed Neal to court increasingly larger businesses to sites that had “all the services” they could need, he said during one board meeting. (Neal did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.)


	Neal also built roads and irrigation systems, constructed fiber optic internet connections for business offices, and expanded a network of pumps and pipes that collected the wastewater from the food and dairy operators. By 2017, the Port was doing $2.8 billion in annual business. In 2019, state lawmakers passed a resolution honoring Neal, noting that when he had taken over the Port “the local economy was in rough shape with high unemployment” and that through his “vision and leadership,” it was now “one of the most productive areas in the state of Oregon.”

	











	Neal's pumps and pipes were an essential part of the vision. It was Neal who built the massive lagoons that effectively recycled the fertilizer used by the farm and food operators. This created another incentive for industrial expansion, as the wastewater was free in exchange for taking it off the Port's hands, and it significantly reduced how much farm operators had to spend on fertilizers. “[We] beneficially reuse approximately 3.6 billion gallons per year of industrial wastewater generated by the food processing and other industrial facilities,” the Port wrote in a 2022 statement touting their wastewater program. The chemical-laced water “provides the local farmers with a valuable service,” delivering “nutrient rich wastewater … in this water-deficient region.”


	In 1989, Neal took a seat on the Columbia River Enterprise Zone (CREZ), a committee that decides which areas are designated for business development incentives. Handing out tax breaks on the committee made him popular with businesspeople. Major additions to the Port during his tenure included Lamb Weston (the largest frozen potato producer in North America, with a more than $9 billion market cap) and Tillamook Creamery (a $1.2 billion operation that produces 180 million pounds of cheese annually). By the beginning of the 2010s, the Port employed around 8,450 full-time workers, a 36 percent increase from 2006. 


	“He took sand and sagebrush and turned it into the second-largest port in the state,” wrote Oregon Rep. Greg Smith, a co-sponsor of the resolution honoring Neal. Smith had worked with Neal at the Port before his election to the statehouse in 2001. “I don't think many people would have the foresight like Gary,” said J.R. Cook, an agriculture industry consultant, when he spoke to the county commission about how Neal utilized his zoning authority. “Looking back on it now, it was a stroke of genius.”


	Neal developed a reputation as an adept bureaucratic salesman, but one with a sometimes combative style. “It became widely known that you didn't speak out against Gary or anyone on his committees,” says Jim Doherty. “Folks out here started to call them the mafia. He wanted to build up the Port and do his deals, and by and large he did them. If he needed approval from the state to build pipes under the highway, or whatever it was, he'd rather do the crime and pay the fine before he wasted the time and effort to go through the proper channels. That was his mindset.”


	Those tactics became apparent in the deals to expand Amazon's data centers. Amazon initially came to the county in 2008, three years before it opened its first data center. The company agreed to pay $1.6 million for 80 acres along the Port's waterfront on the condition that no one involved in the deal could publicly acknowledge Amazon's involvement, according to Don Russell, who was on the county commission at the time. (Amazon spokesperson Levandowski called the company's use of nondisclosure agreements “an industry-wide common practice.” Russell did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) Using strict nondisclosure agreements, Amazon required Neal, who effectively led negotiations with the tech giant, and his colleagues, to refer publicly to the Silicon Valley giant as VAData, a holding company. Jerry Healy, a Port commissioner involved in the deal, would later tell an investigator at the Oregon Ethics Commission that no one was “permitted to use the word Amazon.” (Healy did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) But it wasn't long before news of Morrow County landing business with one of the world's largest companies leaked out. “Everyone knew who they were,” Healy said.

“How can you live with yourself knowing that the water you put in people's houses is causing miscarriages or cancer? And they're still making money on deals for new data centers.”


	By the time the first data center opened in 2011, Neal and his team were already lobbying state legislators for better tax incentive packages that would benefit Amazon. In 2015, those efforts bore fruit: The state passed Senate Bill 611, which exempted data centers from central assessment taxation. Amazon state public policy adviser Eileen Sullivan testified before the Oregon Senate Committee on Finance and Revenue that the bill made it possible for the company to build at least 11 new data centers. “It goes back to jobs and stability,” Neal told reporters. “This helps us round out our economy.”

	











	In 2017, with these new tax breaks in his pocket, Neal began negotiating with Amazon in secret CREZ executive sessions to bring in five more data centers that were each worth $1.9 billion, with footprints twice or triple the size of the first. The tax abatement rules would allow the county, the Port of Morrow, and the city of Boardman to trade tax abatements worth between $1 and $2 billion to the tech giant over the next 15 years.


	The question was what the county would get in exchange for that trade. As the negotiations got underway, Melissa Lindsay joined Jim Doherty as a freshman board member on the County Commission. A fourth-generation farmer with 12,000 acres of rolling hills about 25 miles south of the Port, Lindsay was aware of Neal's success on the waterfront. “The economy that he essentially created here brought him a lot of power and respect,” she tells me.


	She'd been eager to work with Neal on the CREZ committee that was in talks with Amazon. Her goal was to win commitments from the company to provide funds for the school district and emergency services in exchange for the tax breaks. But in CREZ meetings — which along with the three county commissioners included the elected leaders of the city of Boardman, plus Neal and his deputies, who'd been appointed to their roles by the elected Port commissioners — she was struck by how deferential everyone was toward Neal, and seemingly supportive of every one of his ideas and decisions. “He came across as this steward of the county,” Lindsay says. 


	With everyone following Neal's lead, Lindsay realized that other than her and Doherty, no one was interested in wringing much out of Amazon. The deal, it seemed to Lindsay, was already done, and Amazon would give up little to secure the tax abatements. 

	











	Lindsay raised her concerns with Marv Padberg, a commissioner working under Neal at the Port. According to Lindsay, Padberg urged her to avoid meddling and let Neal and his team work with Amazon behind closed doors. “Melissa, you just need to figure out the easy button,” she says Padberg told her. (Padberg did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)


	Lindsay says she also spoke to Sandy Toms, the mayor of Boardman, who represented the city on the enterprise committee and who frequently made the first or second motion for Neal's proposals. Toms, Lindsay says, brushed off her concerns. (Toms died in 2024.)


	“I kept pointing out that we're negotiating billions of dollars,” Lindsay says. “But I was just laughed at, or accused of being jealous, or described as being hard to work with.”


	She noted that her attempts to bring in outside financial advisers or attorneys to negotiate on behalf of the committee were dismissed as unnecessary. Eventually, she was no longer included in talks about the deal with Amazon. That year, Amazon broke ground on the first of the five data centers, a 200,000-square-foot facility with the energy demand equivalent of 30,000 homes and a 15-year tax abatement worth nearly $200 million.


	In 2018, after 29 years as the Port director, Gary Neal stepped down. His son, Ryan, was chosen by the elected members of the Port commission as his successor — a selection process that included Gary's input on potential candidates, according to sources familiar with the appointment. Gary stayed on with the Port as an informal adviser, frequently traveling with his son to meetings with representatives of Amazon and other industrial clients. (Ryan Neal died of Covid complications in 2022 and was succeeded by Lisa Mittelsdorf.)

	










“There are so many bad actors all at once. Each bears direct responsibility for the pollution that they're putting out there.”


	Melissa Lindsay, for her part, could never understand why Neal was so willing to give in to Amazon's demands. “It was brutal to watch how we got nothing for it,” she says of the deals. “But you couldn't stop it. No matter what idea you brought up for a better deal, you were met with extreme pushback.”


	IN 2008, PAT LAURITSEN MOVED to Heppner from Tri-Cities, Washington, to join a struggling fiber optic company called Windwave. An experienced telecom salesperson, Lauritsen would eventually take over Windwave's operation as CEO to “try to make money with the company instead of just losing it all the time,” she says.


	Some of those losses were born of Windwave's unusual corporate structure. Windwave was a for-profit subsidiary of a nonprofit called Inland Development Corporation. Inland's mission was to provide much-needed fiber optic internet to remote rural hospitals and schools, which didn't pay well; Windwave was a commercial pursuit, hooking up internet to industrial clients and private businesses in eastern Oregon. But for years after Windwave was founded in 2004, the profits didn't materialize.


	Lauritsen answered to two distinct boards of directors that shared several members and largely functioned as one oversight body. The board members — who included Gary Neal, Don Russell, Jerry Healy, and Marv Padberg — always seemed skeptical that Windwave would survive. “Gary Neal at every board meeting told me that it'd be a zillion years before we'd become a viable company,” Lauritsen says. “They didn't expect that we would ever make it.”


	None of the board members had experience in commercial telecom. Instead, they'd been selected by Lauritsen's predecessor for their influence in the region's agriculture-dominated industry. “I don't know a thing about putting fiber in the ground,” Healy, who had served on the Port commission since 1994, later told an investigator from the Oregon Ethics Commission. He said that Neal and the other board members focused instead on “financial performance, income statements, balance sheets, cash flows, [and] to set policy.” Often, at board meetings, the public officials would evaluate the real estate tied to fiber optic projects for potential disposal of the Port's wastewater. “Right from the beginning I thought, ‘Oh, this doesn't look good,'” Lauritsen says.


	In 2010, Amazon signed a nearly million-dollar deal with Windwave to install and service miles of underground fiber optic lines for its first data center. Suddenly, Lauritsen noticed, the board members viewed Windwave in a new light. “When we turned the corner and were making a real profit, Don Russell said to the board, ‘Oh man, we need to look at this, there might actually be some money in the company.'”


	For Amazon, there was terrific efficiency to doing business in Morrow County. Gary Neal and his fellow public officials negotiated lucrative tax breaks for new data centers from their positions on the CREZ board, while at the same time Neal and the others oversaw Windwave's board of directors, hammering out what would become dozens of contracts as Amazon's primary fiber optic service provider. Likewise, in his role as the general manager of the Port, Neal ensured that Amazon had no problem dispensing with tens of millions of gallons of its nitrate-laced wastewater. Morrow County, it seemed, had become a one-stop shop for Amazon's data centers. (Amazon spokesperson Levandowski told Rolling Stone, “We work with local officials in their official capacities as representatives of their communities and jurisdictions. Economic development discussions, utility planning, and infrastructure services are handled through standard procurement and regulatory processes with appropriate oversight and transparency.”)

	











	Lauritsen says she wasn't aware that members of the Windwave board were negotiating tax breaks with Amazon or managing the data center wastewater as they were making deals for Windwave fiber optic. She was too busy working 60-hour weeks trying to install enough underground concrete vaults and wire conduits to keep up with the demand from the Amazon campuses. Indeed, according to Lindsay, much of Amazon's dealings with Morrow County officials were kept secret, with those officials often citing NDAs with Amazon as a pretext to move public discussions into private executive sessions.


	In 2016, Gary Neal and his associates embarked on a campaign that would transform Windwave and line their own pockets: an effort to spin off Windwave from Inland and set it up as a stand-alone company — with Neal and the other officials as owners and equal partners. Lauritsen assumed the idea was Neal's: “No decision was ever made that Gary didn't say what he thought first and then the other ones would follow suit,” she says.


	Lauritsen says she was the only member of the Windwave board who objected to slicing up the company into equal portions shared by Neal, Healy, Padberg, Russell, and Blake Lawrence, another board member who'd helped Lauritsen manage construction. (Lawrence did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) She suggested instead that it should be an employee-owned operation as a reward for the loyal crew that had spent years building the fiber optic network that became the backbone of Amazon's data center enterprise. “I thought they deserved to have that money go to their 401(k)s and not to the board members who didn't even believe in the company,” she says. “I asked Gary why did he think that they deserved to have the company and the money it would make, and his comment back to me was, ‘They got their wages, didn't they?'”


	The tension between Lauritsen and the other board members sharpened as she declined an offer to join them as a part owner. “The Inland papers of incorporation write it out fairly clear at the top: No board member is allowed to make or do anything with the company for personal profit,” she says. The hostilities weren't always subtle, with Padberg at one point warning her to “be careful,” she recalls, which she took as a threat. (Padberg did not respond to requests for comment.) Lauritsen resigned from Windwave in 2017; Lawrence replaced her as CEO, and the five men completed the buyout of the company in May 2018.


	News of their financial maneuvering did eventually come to light. An explosive investigation published by The Oregonian in September 2022 accused Amazon of “benefiting mightily from the deals it cut with local officials.” The article quoted Lindsay and Doherty. “Incentives were given,” Lindsay said. “It wasn't always clear what other benefits people at the table might be receiving.” Doherty alleged that Neal and the others had been “working these deals behind the scenes … [setting] themselves up for a windfall.” (An attorney for Neal submitted a letter to the Oregon Ethics Commission claiming Neal recused himself from two discussions of Amazon business and that “all the objective information … demonstrates that no offense or violation occurred during the period at issue.” Russell told The Oregonian that his investment in Windwave was his “private business” and defended his approval of tax breaks for Amazon based on the company's economic contributions to the region.)


	There was no accountability for anyone involved until this past July, when Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield sued the men (and three “disinterested directors” recruited by the owners to approve the sale from the Inland board) in circuit court, alleging that these “established community leaders” had “abused their authority and breached the public trust for their personal financial gain.” In a press release announcing the lawsuit, Rayfield said “this nonprofit was created to connect eastern Oregon communities — not to quietly enrich a handful of officials behind closed doors.”       


	In the lawsuit, Rayfield describes in detail how Neal and the others went about taking Windwave. Their first step was to arrange for a sale price that was well under the actual value of the company. To do that, “the Insiders” — which is how Rayfield described Neal, Healy, Padberg, and Russell — had to get around the Cogence Group, a financial forensics and business valuation firm, which was brought in to conduct a valuation of Windwave.

“The people responsible for the pollution are huge mega-corporations with a lot of power. And they've been getting away with this for decades now.”


	According to Rayfield, the men did this by withholding important financial information about Windwave, namely the lucrative deals they were negotiating with Amazon Web Services. Without that information, Cogence put Windwave's fair market value at $1.8 million. But Windwave's new owners knew the company's value was about to soar, thanks to the Amazon contracts in the pipeline.

	











	In March 2018, a change in federal tax law led Cogence to increase Windwave's valuation to $2.6 million. The board members purchased Windwave at that price two months later. But that figure was still far below the firm's actual value. The AG estimated that at the time Windwave was worth “at least $9.5 million.” All told, they'd reaped $6.9 million in savings by keeping information from Cogence.


	But these insiders did more than just hide the company's value, according to Rayfield. They also ignored the advice of Inland's attorneys to seek what's called a “fairness opinion” before the purchase, to ensure an organization is treated fairly by its directors. And they used their seats on the board to approve two loans to themselves from Inland's nonprofit coffers to cover the entire $2.6 purchase price. What's more, those loans, according to the AG, had “sub-market interest rates [that] required a one-time balloon payment of the loan's balance after five years.”


	The sale of Windwave did not end its financial relationship with Inland — it sweetened it. Inland hired Windwave to continue “its charitable mission of serving rural Oregonians” with fiber optic connections for “schools, libraries, hospitals, courts, law enforcement, and veteran's services.” Only now Inland would have to pay Windwave $200,000 a year over the next five years, ensuring another million-dollar stream of revenue beyond the Amazon data centers. (Windwave later almost doubled the fees it charged its former parent company, earning $350,000 from Inland in 2019, according to the nonprofit's IRS filings.) Before the sale was complete, Healy sought one final concession, massaging the terms of the sub-market loan so that Windwave wouldn't have to repay the balloon payment “for at least another five years,” according to emails cited in Rayfield's filing.


	The sequence of events is complex, but worth summarizing for its audacity. Gary Neal and his partners wrested control of Windwave from its nonprofit parent and sold it to themselves, hiding insider knowledge of lucrative deals with Amazon to keep the price low. They financed the purchase from Inland with money from Inland itself, with below-market loan terms, and made sure that Inland continued to pay them for fiber optic services. They also ensured that they wouldn't have to pay that money back to Inland for a decade, even as they made millions as Windwave's new owners.


	The AG's civil suit seeks a minimum of $6.9 million in damages from Neal and the other Windwave owners, the difference between the falsely undervalued original sale price and the actual estimated value at the time. It also seeks to void the sale itself and return Windwave to Inland. “It's incredibly clear that their motivations were based on profit, and they were willing to use insider information to facilitate their desire to make money,” Rayfield says. “These were elected officials, people in positions of trust in the community, who were cutting deals with Amazon. At the same time, they knew those deals they were sitting on would cause the profits of this company they wanted to purchase to explode.”

	











	News of the lawsuit ripped through Morrow County in July. Many residents were outraged, and relieved that powerful public officials were finally being held to account for at least some of their misdeeds, even if it wasn't for the water pollution. On local Facebook groups, commenters expressed disgust at “the cloud of corruption and exploitation behind it all,” as one person wrote. “They were sitting on boards and commissions meant to represent the public while secretly enriching themselves — using insider knowledge of Amazon's data center expansion that was never shared with the public.” Another person wrote, “Justice rides a slow horse, but it does eventually arrive.”


	Rayfield has not ruled out the possibility of pressing criminal charges, including fraud, if the evidence he uncovers during discovery can be pursued under existing statutes of limitations. He's also left open the possibility that he could add Amazon as a defendant to the civil suit. “Amazon was benefiting from the business deals they were getting,” he told The Oregonian. “It created an economic incentive to be in the area. They chose to make those internal business decisions and be in the community based upon those things.” (In September, attorneys for the Windwave defendants sought to have the suit dismissed, citing in part the state's approval of the sale of Windwave; days later the attorney amended that motion, acknowledging that Windwave board members had not been transparent about their forthcoming business with Amazon while the deal was underway.)


	When reports of the Windwave deal reached Melissa Lindsay, her confusion over Neal's softball negotiating tactics with Amazon disappeared. “They literally gave up taxpayer money for the sake of putting money into their own pockets. They knew from the get-go how big Amazon would become in Morrow County,” she says. “They knew it, they planned for it, and they watched it all happen. It's wild.”


	MELISSA LINDSAY AND JIM DOHERTY would pay a stiff price for speaking out publicly against Neal and the Windwave owners in their dealings with Amazon. In October 2022, a month after The Oregonian investigation was published, several of Neal's longtime political allies launched a recall campaign against both commissioners. Annetta Spicer, a former district attorney in Morrow County and a longtime associate of Neal, filed the petition. She framed Doherty's efforts around the water emergency as a way to gain votes among the area's Latino voters. (Spicer did not respond to repeated requests for comment.) “I don't have a problem with the Hispanic citizens being treated appropriately,” she told Oregon Public Broadcasting. “But [Doherty is] not following through and solving the problem for them.”

	











	Public officials and business leaders with close ties to Neal and his Windwave partners supported the recall campaign, with aggressive attacks at public events and on social media against Doherty and Lindsay's character and motives. The campaign corresponded with decreased sales for Doherty's cattle business. Lindsay says, “It was horrible for myself and my family. It was very painful. They'd gotten away with it for so long. They thought they were untouchable — and they were.”


	In November 2022, the votes were cast. The 165- and 21-vote margins against Doherty and Lindsay, respectively, were enough to remove them from the county commission, effective immediately.


	Doherty and Lindsay weren't the only ones facing consequences for their actions. With the two commissioners out of office, the advocacy group Oregon Rural Action stepped up its efforts to lobby Oregon lawmakers and Brown's successor, Gov. Tina Kotek, to intervene in Morrow County. In November 2023, they hosted a group of state representatives for a tour of homes where wells had nitrate levels as high as 45 ppm.


	During the tour, Kaleb Lay, ORA's research and policy director, said one of his colleagues got a call that his truck was on fire. The ORA member rushed to the vehicle and discovered it torched. Flyers explaining how residents could receive free nitrate tests had been removed from the truck and ripped up, lying in pieces on the street just a few feet away.


	The fire department — some of whose members had publicly griped about Doherty and Lindsay — initially suggested the fire was an act of arson, with one firefighter stating so via the company's dispatch and later noting the presence of turpentine, a flammable solvent. But the fire marshal, Marty Broadbent, told me in November the arson designation “was an internal glitch on our part … something you should never say on the radio.” The identification of turpentine, he said, was also a mistake. He attributed both errors “to one of the firefighters who didn't have any fire investigation skills,” adding, “We've since changed our protocol.” Ultimately, the department ruled the fire an accident and closed its investigation. 


	In November 2024, I sat down with a woman named Kathy Mendoza at her home in Boardman. She'd prepared a plate of cookies she baked that morning, set atop the red tablecloth of her dining room table. With us were members of ORA. Mendoza is 71 years old and had worked for the county's workforce development program for 36 years. She said she'd been forced to retire in 2019 due to a debilitating joint and muscle condition that she believes was caused by exposure to nitrates. “When Jim declared the emergency, I told him I'd been sick for the last three years, and he came out the next day and got my water tested and it was 50.9 ppm. This summer it's up to 55.7 ppm,” she said. “If it wasn't for these people here,” she added, referring to ORA, “and Jim Doherty exposing it all, I don't know that we would ever have been told.”

	











	Mendoza relies on a biweekly water delivery of five five-gallon jugs for cooking all her meals and to drink. Every eight weeks she goes for an infusion of drugs that calms her inflamed immune system. “How can you live with yourself knowing that the water you put in people's houses is causing miscarriages or cancer, or God only knows how it stunts the growth of a kid? How could they do that? Then these people go out and show their faces in public. And they're still making money with it, every time those deals get cut for new data centers.”


	“There are so many bad actors all at once,” says Lay. “Each of these polluters bears direct responsibility for the pollution that they're putting out there and they should be held responsible. But also, at some point, you got to blame the cop for not pulling someone over for speeding every day of their lives for the last 34 years. Every one of these agencies, from the DEQ to the Oregon Department of Agriculture, they all have regulatory authority and they haven't used it.”


	IN APRIL 2024, THE DEQ hit the Port of Morrow with a $727,000 fine for 880 permit violations incurred for spraying excess contaminated water over winter fields between November 2023 and February 2024. But the Port carried on with its winter application until its announcement this fall that it would suspend the practice. “There is no alternative short of closing processing plants,” Port director Lisa Mittelsdorf told a reporter last January.


	The Port has pursued several strategies to mitigate the water crisis, including the purchase of a 5,300-acre dairy farm last year to expand its wastewater dumping. The DEQ allowed the Port to modify its permit in October 2024 to proceed with winter application on the new property, but the crop farmer who still holds a lease on the land from the previous owner had not granted the Port the permission it required to spray on the fields.

	











	In December 2024, the Port gave the governor's office a dramatic ultimatum: If the governor didn't step in with an emergency order suspending the DEQ from levying fines for the illegal dumping of contaminated water during the winter season, the Port would stop accepting wastewater from industrial operators. Citing concerns that the move would lead to “furloughs of potentially thousands of workers resulting in substantial economic harm to the region and the State of Oregon,” the governor granted the Port's request, allowing it to spray contaminated water without fines for a six-week period starting in January 2025. “We must balance protecting thousands of jobs in the region, the national food supply, and domestic well users during this short period of time,” Gov. Kotek explained afterward in a statement.


	The Port is now waiting for approval of a $432 million federal grant that could allow the construction of additional wastewater storage as well as new facilities to eventually reduce wastewater nitrate levels. Meanwhile, Amazon has been paying the Port to help offset the expensive burden of its permit violations and making contributions to the community, including $850,000 to the SAGE Center, a local museum that features an Amazon learning environment called the AWS Think Big Space.


	SINCE THE PUBLIC DECLARATION of the water emergency in 2022, a growing number of residents in Morrow County have become frustrated at a lack of accountability. The attorney general's lawsuit was a step in the right direction, many locals feel, but it was about fiscal self-dealing, not the water that created the opportunity for those actions. In 2024, before the AG suit, investigators from the Oregon Ethics Commission recommended that Neal, Padberg, Healy, and Russell be penalized for failing to disclose their conflicts of interest while negotiating Amazon transactions on behalf of the public. The penalty for the men was $2,000 each, although that did not include Neal. Commission rules limit the scope of any inquiry to the four years prior to the investigation's opening — which in this case stemmed from a whistleblower complaint. This meant that all but a few months of Neal's tenure at Windwave and the Port fell outside the ethics panel's inquiry.


	Still, staff investigators stated that they found an October 2018 meeting discussing Amazon's tax break deal that appeared to warrant Neal being sanctioned. It was during that meeting where “Neal may have engaged in a prohibited use of position and may have failed to disclose his conflicts of interest,” the commission investigators found in their preliminary review. In the end, however, the ethics board overruled its staff and rejected its own investigators' findings, on the grounds that Neal didn't substantially influence the meeting about Amazon, as they wrote in a report. Amazon and the new owners of Windwave were able to continue operating as before.


	That could all change, however, because of an attorney in Seattle named Steve Berman. A class action specialist, Berman rose to prominence in the 1990s during the landmark big tobacco lawsuits by winning the largest single settlement of those suits ($260 billion) on behalf of a consortium of states, and more recently as the lead attorney on behalf of NCAA athletes who can now make money off their own names and likeness competing in college sports.


	In February 2024, representing a group of six Morrow County residents, Berman filed a federal suit against the Port of Morrow, Lamb Weston, and three other large agriculture operators for their role in causing and perpetuating the region's water crisis. Berman tells me that on Dec. 1 he will add Tillamook and Portland General Electric, a local utility, to the list of defendants. (A representative for PGE confirmed the utility received “a notice of intent to sue” and added that the water used “at its Coyote Springs plant [is] for non-contact cooling operations and does not add nitrates to the water supplied by the Port of Morrow.”) Crucially, Berman's suit also lists unnamed John Doe defendants, which several sources close to the case believe to be a placeholder for Berman's biggest target: Amazon.

	











	On March 7, 2024, Berman and his local co-counsel, Michael Bliven, sent what's known as an RCRA Notice, a reference to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, to Amazon. Such notices warn of a pending civil lawsuit and offer potential defendants the opportunity to remediate harm within a given timeframe. Berman and Bliven's RCRA Notice demanded that Amazon “immediately cease all improper storage, transferring, and disposal of the hazardous industrial wastewater and to remediate the harm your company has caused” within 90 days. Berman says Amazon took no action.


	(When asked about the RCRA Notice, Amazon referred Rolling Stone to its original response to this story. The company stressed in that response that its data centers do not add nitrates to the water supply and touted its job creation and an investment of “$39.2 billion in the community since 2011.”)


	“It's considered a basic civic right in the U.S. that the water you drink from your wells or that you get from your town should be clean and not contaminated,” Berman says. “And that right is currently being violated here.”


	Should Berman include Amazon, it would seem to be in the company's best interest to hammer out a pretrial settlement, if only as a strategy to contain the public relations blowback that would result from a lengthy, high-profile class action trial. Weeks of media coverage unpacking the data center public health threat would complicate matters for Amazon as it continues its aggressive rollout of new data centers in rural farming communities across the country. Amazon's connections to Windwave only make the situation more acute: Their representatives engaged in negotiations with public officials in violation of state ethics rules while at the same time paying millions of dollars to a company whose officials are now being sued by the state attorney general.

	











	A week before the Oregon attorney general filed the Windwave complaint, I heard from sources in Boardman who are close to Berman's case. They had been told that Berman's office was in advanced talks with Amazon to settle for $100 million before a trial begins.


	When I spoke to Berman earlier this month, I asked him if Amazon was seeking a settlement. Berman demurred on the record, saying that he could not comment on any negotiations or discussions with current or past defendants while the case was still pending. Amazon did not respond directly to questions about a pending settlement. Should a settlement be in the final stages, the court would issue sealed orders for a federal settlement judge to oversee private hearings for the terms of the deal, a process that could take several months, at which point the court's findings and all of the submitted evidence would be released to the public. 


	“The people whose rights are being violated don't have a lot of power, and the people responsible for the pollution are huge mega corporations with a lot of power,” Berman says. “And they've been getting away with this for decades now.”


	A LEGAL OUTCOME WOULD provide a measure of relief for Morrow County. But some damage is hard to undo.


	Situated on 40 acres along a long, quiet blacktop road, Jim Doherty's ranch home, where he lives with his wife, Kelly, has windows looking out to the pasture where their cattle graze. The Dohertys are in close proximity to dozens of properties with tainted wells. When I visited in November 2024, it had been more than a year since the Dohertys' water had tested “hot,” as Jim described the contamination. Still, Kelly periodically dunks a rapid-test strip in her morning coffee just to be safe. “There's 14 people that live on my road,” Kelly says. “I think nine of them have cancer right now.”

	











	The Dohertys' son, Bryce, lives a few miles away. He and his wife bought their land in 2018, built a new house, and drilled a well that hadn't tested positive for nitrate contamination at the time they moved in. They were eager to start a family. But two years after moving in, they suffered a miscarriage. When that happened, Kelly says, she told Bryce to have their water checked. “And he's like, ‘Mom, we just built the place, it's all undetectable,'” she recalls. “I told him, ‘Bryce, check the goddamn water.' Finally, he tested it. It came back 27 ppm, nearly four times the Oregon limit.


	“They feel guilty that they might have lost that baby because they didn't go back and check the water,” she says. “I told him look, you didn't know. No one knew.”

	A Los Angeles judge said today she's on the brink of ordering the sale of Nicki Minaj's $20 million Hidden Hills mansion so a security guard can collect on the $500,000 default judgment he won after suing the “Barbie World” rapper and her husband over his alleged backstage assault at a concert in Germany.


	“My tentative is to grant this,” Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Cindy Pánuco said at an afternoon hearing. “I just want to make sure we're getting it right.” She said the only outstanding document in the application to force the home's sale was a Bank of America statement detailing Minaj's payments on the $13.3 million mortgage since October 2022 and the daily interest accrual.


	“Let's say there's no bidder who offers the full $20 million, and it goes up for auction, and they don't get fair market value, and it doesn't cover everything,” Pánuco gave as a hypothetical. “If it doesn't cover what the sale is required to cover — including the judgment, in this instance — then I would use that evidence to help me to determine that.”

	











	The guard's lawyer, Paul Saso, argued that the sale would almost certainly yield millions more than necessary to cover everything. And if it didn't, they could deal with that possibility at a later date, he said. But the judge wouldn't budge, saying she wanted the bank statement first. “As I understand it, that's the only piece missing. Everything else looked good,” she said. She set a follow-up hearing for Jan. 22 to receive the pending paperwork and enter her ruling.

	











	Plaintiff Thomas Weidenmuller filed his application for the order last month, telling the court he tried to enforce the default judgment through less extreme measures, but Minaj and her husband, Kenneth Petty, have not responded. He says seven “potential garnishees” claimed they did “not have any accounts payable to Minaj or otherwise failed to respond at all.”


	The eight-bedroom luxury home has a $13,258,000 mortgage lien, and Minaj, as the sole owner, would be entitled to a $722,151 homestead exemption, the application, obtained by Rolling Stone, said. With the home recently appraised at $20 million, a sale would yield approximately $6 million in funds once the lien and exception are paid, it estimated.

	“There is no doubt that the sale of the dwelling would satisfy the entire judgment, with millions to spare,” the application said. “Although it is regrettable that the extraordinary measure of forcing the sale of Minaj's dwelling is required, that result is entirely the product of her intransigence in not making payment.”


	The application described Minaj as a global music superstar with an estimated net worth of at least $150 million. “There is little doubt that she is highly capable of paying the judgment in full, and yet, she has refused to do so despite multiple written requests for payment and levies served upon several of her suspected creditors,” the filing said.


	Weidenmuller sued the couple in January 2022, alleging Petty ambushed him from behind and sucker punched him in the face as retribution for Weidenmuller stepping in to defend a female security guard during a dispute with Minaj during the 2019 concert in Frankfurt.


	According to Weidenmuller, Minaj became visibly frustrated and blamed the female guard for allowing a fan to breach a barricade and climb onstage with her. Minaj allegedly started berating the female security guard while recording the exchange. Weidenmuller says he stepped in and told Minaj it wasn't fair that the guard's career might be “ruined” on social media. In response, Minaj allegedly threw a shoe at Weidenmuller but missed. Weidenmuller claims Petty later accused him of disrespecting Minaj and punched him in the face, leaving him “stunned and disoriented.”

	“I felt a blinding pain in my head, neck, face, and jaw. I could tell in that instant that something was seriously wrong with my jaw,” he wrote in a court filing. He said medics called an ambulance to take him to a hospital. He underwent the first of several surgeries and stayed there for 10 days, he said.

	











	“I now have five plates in my jaw, and my jaw has not yet been fully reconstructed. The doctors must still insert implants into my jaw as a part of the reconstruction process. In the interim, the doctors have inserted donor bones from a deceased person into my mouth in order to preserve space for the future implants,” he wrote in a sworn statement.


	Weidenmuller previously asked for around $21,000 to cover medical bills and $700,000 for his ongoing injury and emotional pain and suffering. The judge trimmed it down to $503,318 when she awarded the money Friday under a default judgment because Minaj and Petty never responded to the lawsuit.


	Weidenmuller's lawyers told the court they made repeated attempts to serve Minaj and Petty with the complaint but were never successful. They mailed copies and sent a process server to the couple's gated community in Calabasas, California, but never made contact. They eventually published the summons in a newspaper.


	A rep for Minaj and Petty did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Rolling Stone sent Monday. The couple married in 2019 and welcomed a son a year later. The house they share in Hidden Hills is Minaj's sole property, according to court documents.


	Petty, meanwhile, remains a defendant in a sexual assault lawsuit filed in Brooklyn federal court by Jennifer Hough, the woman at the center of Petty's 1994 attempted rape conviction.

	Hough claims Petty accosted her at a Queens bus stop in September 1994 when they were high school students. She claims he forced her to a nearby residence at knifepoint and raped her. Petty was ultimately convicted of first-degree attempted rape in 1995 and spent four and a half years in prison. Decades later, in January 2020, he was charged with failing to register as a sex offender when he moved to Los Angeles in 2019. He was sentenced to three years of probation and briefly placed on house arrest in 2023 for violating the terms of the probation.

The memo, sent last week, marked the beginning of iHeart's new "Guaranteed Human" program. 


													By
												

	Kristin Robinson


Senior Writer


	iHeartRadio's chief programming officer and president, Tom Poleman, sent a letter to staff on Friday (Nov. 21), obtained by Billboard, pledging that the company doesn't and won't “use AI-generated personalities” or “play AI music that features synthetic vocalists pretending to be human,” among other promises.


	The pledge marks the beginning of iHeart's new “Guaranteed Human” program, which will also see the company publish only “Guaranteed Human” podcasts, according to Poleman's letter.


	Starting Monday (Nov. 24), “‘Guaranteed Human' is a core part of our brand,” Poleman wrote. “You'll hear it in our imaging, and we want listeners to feel it every time they tune in.” iHeartRadio DJs must now add a line to their hourly legal IDs about being “Guaranteed Human.” 


	“Remember, this isn't a tagline — it's a promise,” Poleman added. “And it's part of every station's personality.”


	News of the pro-human content initiative comes after recent headlines about the growth — and increasing indistinguishability — of AI-generated voices, songs and podcasts. According to French streaming service Deezer, 97% of participants in a recent study could not tell the difference between AI and human-made songs; the platform also estimates that 50,000 full AI-generated songs are added to their service every day. Billboard also recently revealed that AI music company Suno is generating 7 million tracks a day. 


	While most of these AI songs aren't receiving many streams or sales, there have been several breakthroughs in recent weeks. This includes Xania Monet, an artist whose work was recorded using Suno and paired with AI images. Her song “How Was I Supposed to Know?” recently debuted on the Adult R&B Airplay chart and has been put in rotation by a handful of radio stations across the U.S.


	In terms of radio DJs, an AI radio personality called DJ Tori has taken over the undesirable overnight and weekend shifts at a hard-rock radio station in Hiawatha, Iowa, called KFMW Rock 108, according to a Rolling Stone report. Her voice and image — that of a fashionable tattooed rocker — are both AI-generated. Meanwhile, will.i.am launched RAiDiO.FYI, an interactive AI radio app featuring synthetic voices that tell you about the songs that are playing. Spotify also continues to push its AI DJ feature, programmed based on the voice and persona of one of its employees.


	In the world of podcasting, a company called Inception Point AI, founded by a former Wondery executive, has more than 5,000 podcasts and is generating 3,000 episodes a week at a cost of $1 or less per episode.


	To underscore his point to iHeart employees, Poleman added some stats, including that “70% of consumers say they use AI as a tool, yet 90% want their media to be from real humans,” and that “92% say nothing can replace human connection — up from 76% in 2016.”


	Read the full letter below.


Team,


A few weeks ago, I shared that iHeart is one of the last truly human entertainment sources and our listeners come to us for companionship, connection, and authenticity — something AI can't replicate. We're Guaranteed Human. We don't use AI-generated personalities. We don't play AI music that features synthetic vocalists pretending to be human. And the podcasts we publish are also Guaranteed Human.


Thank you for leaning into our commitment to keep everything we do real and authentic. That's what makes us special. And now we're taking it a step further.


Starting Monday, 11/24, we're making “Guaranteed Human” a core part of our brand. You'll hear it in our imaging, and we want listeners to feel it every time they tune in. Here's how:


Hourly Legal IDs:


We're changing hourly legal IDs beginning Monday to say:


“(Station call letters/name), (city of license) an iHeartRadio station… Guaranteed Human” (with the iHeartRadio audio signature heartbeat).


These will run every hour on our stations.


Sweepers


To augment our legal IDs, we also want you to create fun, nonchalant sweepers that fit your station's vibe and reinforce that we're Guaranteed Human. Sweepers should end with the words “Guaranteed Human.” Drop them in every hour, between songs or talk content where it feels natural. Many stations will also start these on Monday, with others ramping up in the following weeks.


Attached are examples of the hourly legal ID and sweepers.


Remember, this isn't a tagline — it's a promise. And it's part of every station's personality. When listeners interact with us, they know they're connecting with real voices, real stories, and real emotion. That's our superpower.


A little about why this matters so much; research says:


To be clear, we do encourage the use of AI powered productivity and distribution tools that help scale our business operations – such as scheduling, audience insights, data analysis, workflow automation, show prep, editing and organization. Those tools help us reach more people efficiently, while preserving the human creativity and authenticity that define our brand.


We talk to our listeners constantly, and they tell us they are also using AI as a tool, but they tell us there's a limit:


The bottom line is our research tells us that 96% of consumers think “Guaranteed Human” content is appealing. So, we're leaning in.


Thank you for keeping it real and making “Guaranteed Human” something that our audience hears and feels every day.


Sometimes you have to pick a side — we're on the side of humans.


Tom

The K-pop group is the first of its kind to step behind the iconic NPR desk.


													By
												

	Abby Webster



	In early November, one cluttered corner of the NPR office in Washington, D.C., received a new type of memento. As global superstars SEVENTEEN became the first K-pop group to make their official Tiny Desk debut in the U.S., their light stick took its rightful place on the set's iconic bookshelf alongside a hoard of trinkets left by previous musical guests, including Sabrina Carpenter's bedazzled martini glass — and Billboard was once again on hand to witness it all, from rehearsal to goodbyes.


	While a few offshoots of NPR's concert series have welcomed K-pop acts in the past, SEVENTEEN members Joshua, Mingyu, Seungkwan, Vernon and Dino were the first to perform behind the actual desk. And filming in the office base meant the most rigorous of standards were set in place: no floor monitors, no in-ears, no post-production magic or vocal touch-ups. Taken together, these are no small asks, even for veteran performers now a decade into their careers.


	Then there's the matter of size. “Any group with a large number of lead singers is hard to bring to the desk,” says Suraya Mohamed, executive producer for NPR Music, who adds that vocalist DK was originally supposed to attend the shoot before losing his voice. While a sprawling ensemble in its entirety may technically be able to squeeze into the space, she explains, that's without accompanying band members and several instruments. Plus, only around five or six people comfortably fit in the front of the desk.


	All these challenges combined, beyond creating the raw, authentic atmosphere that Tiny Desk has come to be known for, stretch artists to reach new highs, say its producers. And trust SEVENTEEN to rise to the occasion. All the world's a stage for K-pop's main theater kids, who recently wrapped the U.S. leg of their NEW_ world tour. Whether they're playing to 18,000 cheering fans or an office of public media employees, it's hard not to walk away from one of their shows inexplicably and irrevocably charmed.


	In the video posted to NPR's YouTube channel on Monday (Nov. 24), the group confesses to having experienced some nervousness before the shoot. But while working through a medley of nine songs spanning years of their catalog — from blistering hits “Hot” and “Clap” to beloved b-side “To You,” with a fair share of stellar high notes sprinkled in — those nerves were more than melted away by the warm reception in the room. “I don't think I've ever seen such a response on Tiny Desk,” Vernon says, visibly blown away by the energy the crowd gives them throughout. “This is awesome. Thank you so much.” 


	Given all that went on behind the camera, here's a roundup of 3 things you didn't see in SEVENTEEN's Tiny Desk debut.


	About forty-five minutes before the taping begins, the members emerge already in glam and almost fully outfitted (except Vernon, sans jacket in the warm afternoon office space) for the last round of rehearsal. As soon as they assemble behind the desk, Seungkwan corrals everyone together for a selfie; their staff rush around with vlogging cameras, always having content to make. Still, this is the group as the public seldom gets to see it, focused and discerning as they run through the setlist with their five-piece band — comprised of close, longtime collaborators like Park Kitae — one final time. 


	Even in serious work mode, though, this is clearly a team that loves its job. Dino breaks Seungkwan's composure by staring directly into his eyes while the vocalist belts ad-libs; Joshua gets a kick out of sharing a name with the shoot's audio engineer: “Easy to remember!” quips sound guy Josh, as the L.A.-born singer smiles and laughs beatifically. Mingyu, meanwhile, gussied up in a cowboy hat and shades even before cameras are rolling, playfully pokes fun at how squished their keyboardist appears with his instrument and back flush against two different surfaces of the small stage. 


	Since the Tiny Desk space is, after all, quite tiny, it takes some maneuvering to make sure every performer fits into the wide shot. Vernon has a habit of stepping back and vibing when it's not his turn to sing, inadvertently making him disappear from view. (“I move a lot,” he nods in confirmation.) Since the rapper also has one of the softer voices, it also takes him a few tries to calculate exactly how close to get to the super sensitive mic. Then, once he finds that balance — “Don't breathe!” someone jokes — the group is dismissed until it's time to shoot the real thing.


	After a hyped-up audience of NPR staff and guests clad in tour jerseys and bearing concert signs pile into the space, Mohamed gives a few brief opening remarks from her makeshift podium — that is, behind a light stick propped onto a mic stand. While Tiny Desk intros can often get quite emotional, the producer later tells Billboard, she forgoes her planned speech, instead simply imploring the room to give the guys their all.   


	Explicit permission to bark is also granted, if the spirit so moves them. And while there is a distinct lack of barking during the taping — it is 1 p.m. on a Monday, after all — those present inside the office space deliver in just about every other way imaginable over the next thirty minutes: even before SEVENTEEN emerge from their green room, the small but mighty crowd is already chanting their name. 


	It seems to go above and beyond their expectations, since they look bowled over by the sheer volume of cheers during high-energy opener “Super.” “We expected a more calm and quiet environment,” an extraordinarily smiley Vernon translates for Seungkwan, while Joshua finishes with an astonished, “Because…it's an actual office.”


	Would it be a SEVENTEEN concert without a little bit of audience participation? Like on their tour, the floor is opened to requests, yielding pleas for impromptu performances of overlooked b-sides, such as “My I” and “Q&A.” (During rehearsal, their staff suggests “Fronting,” to which the guys gasp, “It's been ten years!”) On tape, “HBD” is the winner, and it doubles as a particularly heartwarming birthday message for one lucky fan in the crowd.


	But their encores are another level entirely. In fact, it pays to practice: before the group comes out, everyone is asked to hop in place three times to get their blood pumping. By the time “Aju Nice,” their eternal encore song, rolls around, the crowd is warmed up and ready to jump — despite the concerned singers inquiring if it's safe to do so. The building does indeed hold, though the bouncing is a hilariously muted version of what tends to go down at their live shows, since the carpeted flooring muffles all the footsteps.


	In addition to grabbing the “Aju Nice” poster shown in the video, the guys take a moment to point out another banner with the faces of enlisted bandmates Jeonghan, Wonwoo, Hoshi and Woozi. (“They're watching with us!” Joshua's exclaims.) Then, once everything is a wrap, their crew finally whisks them away, but not before the members oblige a few photos and sign photocards, practically grinning ear to ear.

With his Cannes-lauded feature debut leading the BIFA nominations and representing the U.K. at the Oscars, the filmmaker reflects on the surprise of being named a BAFTA Breakthrough and why he still sees himself as "a real student of the craft."

Akinola Davies Jr. has been on quite the run this year. The British-Nigerian filmmaker's feature directorial debut, My Father's Shadow, premiered in the Un Certain Regard program at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, where it received a special mention for the Camera d'Or Award. More recently, the Lagos-set coming-of-age tale led the nominations for the 2025 British Independent Film Awards (BIFAs) with 12 nods. It is also the official U.K. submission for the best international feature film Oscar.


	Previously, Davies' narrative short Lizard premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival, winning the Sundance Grand Jury Prize and getting nominated for the BAFTA for Best British Short. In addition to his work in narrative film, he has directed music videos for such artists as Kae Tempest, Neneh Cherry and Blood Orange, plus he has worked on projects with such brands as Gucci, Kenzo and Louis Vuitton, in front of and behind the camera.

	With all the attention that Davies has received this year, it made all the sense in the world to see his name on the 2025 BAFTA Breakthrough Brits list of up-and-coming U.K. industry talent, supported by Netflix, unveiled on Tuesday. 


	However, the creative himself was taken by surprise by his inclusion in the latest Breakthrough cohort. “I got an email, and in true Akinola fashion, I just kind of skimmed through it, but didn't really read it,” Davies tells THR. “I thought I was just being invited to something.” He later decided to give the message his full attention. “I went back and read it, and it was like, ‘Congratulations!' And I thought, ‘holy shit.' But … it wasn't up until I spoke to the guys at BAFTA, and they explained stuff that I [realized]: ‘Oh my god, it's real.'”

	











	What does Davies hope to get out of the BAFTA Breakthrough experience? “I just want to speak to people. I just want to know the details of what people went through to get stuff made, and what aspects of their niche part within the industry they really geek out on. Because I just want to learn more. I want to be a real student of the craft.”


	Davies says he loves the idea of talking to a broad range of artists to “coalesce a huge amount of opinions from everyone,” including people who work below the line and in different departments. “Because anything that helps me and helps my departments collaborate, I'm super happy about. … I want to come out of it and feel like I've been to the best film holiday camp.”


	Davies is aware that it can open further doors to be part of the U.K. BAFTA Breakthrough group. “I think it also massively increases my profile as a filmmaker, and I can't be naive to that,” he tells THR. “And I want to take that on with a sense of responsibility to just keep learning and being a student as best as I can, moving that into future projects, and continually earn the right to be here.”


	Davies is excited that an old friend is also part of the latest Breakthrough Brits, namely Nathalie Pitters, director of photography on Brian and Maggie. “I used to work on reception in an ad agency way back in the day, and a young woman came in and sat next to me, and her name is Nathalie Pitters. We started talking and we really get on,” the filmmaker recalls. “I'm like, ‘What do you want to do?' And she says, ‘I take pictures, but I want to be a cinematographer.' I said, ‘Oh, well, hopefully one day I'll be a director and we can work with each other.' And we subsequently did. We worked on some small productions together.”

	











	When they found out that they were both on the BAFTA Breakthrough list it felt extra special. “It's such a crazy story,” says Davies. “We both had this moment of just remembering, 16 or even 17 years ago, being on that desk in reception, being office runners buying fruit and milk for the office, and having this dream in the distance. And both arriving here at the same time is so wild.”


	Has Davies had much contact with Netflix and its team before being on the Breakthrough list? “No, I haven't,” he shares. “I really haven't had the privilege of meeting people at Netflix. So, yeah, Netflix, give me a shout!”

The annual list spotlights U.K. creatives making their mark across film, TV and games, with Netflix partnering once again to accelerate careers on the cusp of major momentum.

	The BAFTA Breakthrough 2025 U.K. creatives have been unveiled, and they include the likes of On Falling writer-director Laura Carreira, What It Feels Like for a Girl star Ellis Howard, Akinola Davies Jr., the director and co-writer of U.K. international Oscar submission My Father's Shadow, Matthew Gurney, the star of BBC revenge thriller Reunion, and in the games categroy: Cara Ellison, writer and narrative designer of Ghost Town and Sally Beaumont, lead voice actor/script consultant/additional writer of Old Skies.


	“BAFTA Breakthrough, supported by Netflix, is BAFTA's flagship new talent initiative to accelerate extraordinary people working in games, TV and film who are on the cusp or in the midst of a breakthrough moment or year,” BAFTA highlights. “Now in its 12th year, Breakthrough remains an essential part of BAFTA's mission to inspire and nurture creative talent, and a hugely significant part of our overall narrative and year-round activity. From facilitating key meetings with BAFTA's global membership and key industry figures, to coaching and career development, BAFTA Breakthrough is unique and hugely successful.”

	Past BAFTA Breakthrough artists have included such stars as Florence Pugh, Josh O'Connor, Ambika Mod, Rose Ayling-Ellis, Bella Ramsey, Letitia Wright, Paapa Essiedu, Jessie Buckley and Tom Holland.

	











	This year's U.K. cohort covers craft specialists from costume design, production, casting, editing and games design, to performance, writing, directing, composing and cinematography. The creatives “have worked on some of the most acclaimed creative projects from the last year,” BAFTA said.  


	“It is an absolute pleasure to welcome this year's outstanding participants of BAFTA Breakthrough,” says Jane Millichip, CEO of BAFTA. “For 12 years, this BAFTA talent program has supported creatives and practitioners in film, games and television to navigate the often complex corridors of the screen arts. I am enormously grateful to Netflix for their continued support of BAFTA and for their shared passion and commitment to providing opportunity and career pathways for U.K. talent from all backgrounds.” 


	Added Anne Mensah, vp, U.K. content at Netflix: “Netflix is passionate about supporting and uplifting the next generation of talent from across the industry. The Breakthrough U.K. cohort announced today comprises such an exciting range of names, and it is an honor to continue to support an initiative that will help these brilliant creatives build connections, improve confidence, and ultimately launch the next phase of their careers.”


	Millichip highlights how the initiative fits into the cross-career work of the organization. “At BAFTA, we work at all levels,” she tells THR. “We start working with talent in schools, with our schools outreach program. We then move into bursaries for Kickstarter programs, scholarships and then we start to look at the mid-career work that we can do. And Breakthrough is about that, really. It has a real breadth of talent across film, games, and television.”

	











	The artists selected may have had a big moment, but BAFTA and Netflix want to help them with their next career steps. “It's taking people who've had, as the title suggests, a breakthrough moment, a key project that they have broken new ground with, received great credits for, and it's really about picking them up at that point in their career and saying, ‘What do you need next? How can we help you?'” explains Millichip. “Because managing your own career, particularly in a freelance environment, can be very difficult. … You've had a breakthrough moment, and what you do next with your career is really important, not only to you, but to the people you work with. So, we're really proud of Breakthrough, and we work really closely with Netflix on how we design the program to make sure it is as impactful as possible for our participants, but also it's where they take that and pay it forward.”


	Concludes the BAFTA CEO: “The important thing about Breakthrough is not just the impact that BAFTA can have on the cohort, it's the impact that the cohort has on the industry and the public.” 


	She adds that those who have gone through past Breakthrough experiences can then give back to others. “None of them has pulled up the ladder behind them,” highlights Millichip. “They are all reaching down to bring others with them, to share their knowledge, to break new ground, and that's what BAFTA is about. The biggest impact is the impact they have on the industry.”

For people who are interested in searching for extraterrestrial life, the “Wow!” signal is one of the most famous events ever recorded.

The signal was captured back on August 15th, 1977 by the Big Ear radio telescope observatory at Ohio State University. On that day, a narrowband radio signal was received and recorded.

Days later, Jerry Ehman, an astronomer, reviewed the data and something jumped out at him. The signal sequence had a pattern that was nothing like the normal background noise that is always present. This pattern lasted for 73 seconds, so it was much more than just a little blip. When he noticed this, he wrote “Wow!” in the margins, and so the signal was named.

For over four decades now, this signal has been studied formally and informally by thousands of people, and none of them have been able to come up with a satisfactory answer as to where the signal came from. There have been many attempts to explain the signal, but they have all either been ruled out or lack any type of strong support that would prove them true.

One of those unproven theories is, of course, that the signal came from aliens. In a letter to iconic astronomer Carl Sagan in 1994, Ohio State University Radio Observatory director, John Kraus, wrote:

“The ‘Wow!' signal is highly suggestive of extraterrestrial intelligent origin, but little more can be said until it returns for further study.”

The latest studies, which are published on arXiv (here and here) have not yet been peer reviewed, but they do offer detailed information about the signal itself in a way that is much clearer than would have been available before. The team wrote in the study, saying:

“Our study did not conclude that the Wow! Signal constituted evidence of a signal emanating from an extraterrestrial civilization. However, null results are instrumental in refining future technosignature searches. NASA and other agencies remain committed to their search for biosignatures within the atmospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets.”

Publishing this information will open the door for future researchers to have better information that can help to hopefully further narrow down where this signal came from.

UFO at night in a forest (Shutterstock).

A 1956 book favored by UFO believers that is considered "an enduring classic in the fields of new religious studies, cult research, and social psychology," is being called into question as a potential lie, according to Anna Merlan in Mother Jones.

 When Prophecy Fails, written by Leon Festinger, Henry W. Riecken, and Stanley Schachter, details a study of a UFO cult known as the Seekers that predicted the end of the world.

The book also introduced the theory of cognitive dissonance, which explains the psychological mechanisms for how people cope when their deeply held beliefs are contradicted by reality.

"The book is gripping, an in-depth social and psychological study of Martin's group and how they behaved, both as it was forming and after their prophetic visions failed to take place," Merlan explains, adding that "it has served as a key basis for the psychological concept of cognitive dissonance."

That theory "was taken further by Festinger, who wrote a widely-cited followup book on cognitive dissonance and how people try to engage in 'dissonance reduction' to reduce the psychological pressure and unease they experience when confronted with conflicting information," she notes.

But a new study that examined Festinger's recently unsealed papers claims that the book "leans on lies, omissions and serious manipulation," Merlan says.

"The article, published this month in the peer-reviewed Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, also argues that, contrary to the researchers' longstanding narrative, the group members all showed clear signs of quickly abandoning their beliefs when the UFOs failed to arrive, and that the group soon dissolved," Mother Jones reports.

Thomas Kelly, the author of the article, says "while core members of the group stayed active in UFO spaces, they did not keep insisting on a world-ending flood, or that aliens would land and take them away."

The Seekers, Kelly notes, were quick to disavow those beliefs and eventually rebranded.

The group's leader Dorothy Martin "distanced herself completely from these events, even rewriting the story of how she developed her psychic powers," Kelly writes.

"Kelly's paper not only undercuts the researchers' claims and their application of the theory developed from them, but also alleges they committed scientific misconduct, including 'fabricated psychic messages, covert manipulation, and interference in a child welfare investigation,'" Merlan explains.

Kelly says that researchers "twisted the group's behavior to fit their thesis, downplaying the proselytization they did before the prophecy failed and playing up any proselytization that occurred after."

Merlan notes that this interpretation is key, "because the thesis of When Prophecy Fails is clear: after Martin's failed prophecy, her group doubled down, not only by refusing to acknowledge that their core predictions had utterly failed, but banding together with a new zeal to spread them."

"The interference Kelly uncovered goes beyond manipulation," Merlan notes,  but not everyone agrees with Kelly's interpretation.

Poulomi Saha, a University of California-Berkeley associate professor in critical theory who is writing a book on the cultural fascination with cults, says Kelly used a narrow reading of limited materials to draw his conclusion.

"This author ends up doing what he accuses the authors of When Prophecy Fails of doing, which is cherrypicking evidence," Saha says of Kelly, adding, “if we want to critique the methods and think about how methodology has changed in 70 years, I would encourage that. We're talking about different academic and scholarly methods 70 years ago around things like participant observation.”

Saha also says that Kelly was “very dismissive” of the fact that group members continued to believe in UFOs.

Thibault Le Texier, an associate researcher at France's European Centre for Sociology and Political Science, says that "There are findings that people want to hear and findings that people don't want to hear,” and regardless of what people believe, the book will probably continue to "gain a lot of attention in spite of being debunked."

"It's also because these are fascinating stories, as riveting as a great movie," he adds.

Merlan agrees, saying, "For now, at least, Prophecy continues to be widely referred to as a classic of the genre. The aliens, it must be said, have not yet landed."

Celebrity psychic Sally Morgan, known as psychic Sally, has been forced to cancel her upcoming shows after suffering with pneumonia.

Spooky season can be forever if you add these supernatural fiction titles to your TBR list.

Paranormal fiction is basically a “best of all worlds” situation: It blends the escapism of fantasy with the inspired realism of science fiction, while also dabbling in practically every other literary genre, from horror to romance and everything in between. In a nutshell, the paranormal genre refers to books dealing with concepts or figures that can't currently be explained by science but could maybe, possibly be one day—think ghosts, psychics, werewolves, and vampires—in contrast to the fantasy and supernatural genres, which encompass topics that operate completely beyond our natural world.

With those parameters in mind, paranormal novels can range from the spine-tinglingly creepy to the sweetly cozy, meaning there's something for everyone within the genre. Here, we've rounded up 15 of the best paranormal fiction books out there, spanning horror, romance, and mystery, from spooky classics like Dracula to a ghostly new love story from Nicholas Sparks and M. Night Shyamalan—with a stop in Forks, Washington, along the way for all the Twihards out there.

 






The classic Gothic horror novel tells the story of a mysterious nobleman who begins terrorizing the residents of an English town after moving away from his Transylvanian castle, prompting a group led by Abraham Van Helsing to hunt him down. Even if you're already familiar with the story, if you haven't read the actual text, it's worth sinking your teeth into.

 






Shirley Jackson's terrifying tale has long been lauded as one of the best haunted house stories ever written. It delves into a series of sinister phenomena that not only occur at the titular abode but seem to be caused by the home itself.

 






This 2025 novel draws on Indigenous folklore and on Carson Faust's own family history to explore haunting on two fronts: by generational wounds and by the literal ghosts that a young woman helps to lay to rest in her quest to find her missing sister.

 






Stanley Kubrick's iconic 1980 psychological horror film is based on Stephen King's 1977 book, in which a family moves into the secluded Overlook Hotel during its off-season. Soon, the estate's darkly haunted history becomes visible to the family's young son—who secretly has psychic abilities—and sends the father spiraling into unstable territory.

 






I may not have been able to read this book anywhere close to bedtime, but that didn't stop me from zooming through it. In Marcus Kliewer's novel, a mysterious family shows up at a young couple's door, claiming that the father grew up in the home and wants to show his family around…and then they just won't leave. Things become increasingly unsettling as the story unfolds. Buckle up: There's an entire Reddit community full of theories and additional clues just waiting for you to dive in once you're done reading.

 






This first book in Victoria Laurie's cozy mystery series introduces Abby, a crime-solving P.I.—psychic intuitive, that is—as she scrambles to catch the killer of one of her clients. The 2004 novel kicked off a series that now features 15 books. The most recent in the series hit shelves in 2017 and was based on Laurie's own experiences as a professional psychic.

 






Another series-starting novel, Dead Until Dark is the first book in a series that would go on to become the basis of the hit HBO show True Blood. It introduces Sookie Stackhouse, a mind-reading waitress in Louisiana who finds herself swept into the case of a mysterious string of murders not long after she starts dating a handsome vampire.

 






A young woman named Ruby moves into a new apartment only to find its deceased previous tenant still living there as a ghost. Though different in practically every way—both on this plane and the next—they're forced to team up to solve the suspicious murder of their neighbor across the hall.

 






Bestselling author Simone St. James's 2015 book is set in the 1920s and is a genre-defying story that combines paranormal happenings with historical fiction, classic mystery, and a dash of romance. After a famous medium, Gloria, is killed at a séance, she leaves behind a message for her ex-friend and professional rival Ellie, who ends up partnering up with a skeptic to dig into the mysteries of Gloria's life and death, even as a sinister force closes in behind them.

 






Birdie Devine, a detective in Victorian London, finds herself tasked with unraveling the mystery of the kidnapping of a child who's rumored to have supernatural powers. It's an assignment that leads Birdie to be assisted by a delightfully quirky cast of characters, including a moody ghost, a seven-foot-tall maid, and a friendly apothecary.

 






Ali Hazelwood is the prolific writer of rom-coms such as Love, Theoretically, and she first experimented with the paranormal romance subgenre with this 2024 novel. The book follows a vampire forced into an arranged marriage with a werewolf to help keep the peace between their rival factions. Did someone say enemies-to-lovers? 

 






After dying in a hit-and-run, New Orleans resident Aurie finds herself a ghost existing in a murky space between realms. In the realm on the other side known as Overlay City, she teams up with a psychic empath and a werewolf detective to uncover the truth about her death…and, maybe, to share some very spicy afterlife experiences.

 






Reigning kings of romance and psychological thrillers Nicholas Sparks and M. Night Shyamalan, respectively, teamed up for this “supernatural love story,” which is already set to become a movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Phoebe Dynevor. The novel follows architect Tate on a visit to Cape Cod, where he quickly begins falling for a woman named Wren, who challenges him to broaden his worldview beyond the easily explainable.

 






A half-formed melody haunts two people living in a seaside North Carolina town, forging a mysterious but undeniable connection between a songwriter with writer's block and an arrogant musician. The two decide to work together to finish the song in hopes of finally getting it out of their heads (and hearts).

 






Has a more indelible paranormal romance than the one between Bella and Edward ever existed? I think not. Stephenie Meyer's modern classic of a YA novel opens up a lager series, in which a teenage girl falls for a century-old vampire, ends up in a love triangle with a werewolf, demands to be turned into a vampire herself, has a kid whose mate turns out to be the aforementioned werewolf, and, throughout it all, is regularly caught up in battles between warring vampire factions.

London is full of grand old hotels but The Langham stands out - And no, it is not just for its long history, polished interiors and famous afternoon tea, but also for a story that still follows it around.

Back in 2014, during England's home series against Sri Lanka, some of the England players were staying at this hotel. Everything was normal until one late night when a very unexpected incident took place. Like paceman Stuart Broad says, they have a particular reason to be spooked during matches in London after ghostly goings.

Speaking to the Mail, he recalled, "During the Sri Lanka Test I had to move rooms." The bowler further added, "One night I woke up in the middle of the night, around 1.30am and I was convinced there was a presence in the room. It was the weirdest feeling. “I turned the light on and looked online and could see (England wicketkeeper) Matt Prior was online, too. I went to his room and he said exactly the same thing! He was wide awake as well. Neither of us could sleep because we were so spooked out. Matt was in a twin room so I ended up sharing with him."

According to an Instagram video, which is going viral, Broad woke up after he felt that the room was heating up. Suddenly, he saw a big fluorescent ball floating in his room, the tap water running in the bathroom with sound of footsteps. The moment he turned on the light, the ball disappeared. This is when he decided to run to his teammate Matt's room, which was on the same floor and told him about the experience he had. Matt then told him that he had the same experience.

The hotel, which first opened in 1865, has always been known for its old-world charm. It has tall ceilings, classic woodwork and long hallways that have seen generations of guests walk through. With that kind of history, it surely is not surprising that people have their own theories about what might linger in such an old building.

For most visitors, The Langham is a peaceful and elegant place to stay. It is located near the Regent Street, which also makes it ideal for shopping and sightseeing. The Palm Court is famous for its afternoon tea, and the hotel's restaurants and bars are favourites among both tourists and London locals. As per the reviews available online, the rooms are modern, comfortable and quiet. 

Most guests never notice anything unusual. However, the 2014 incident has become a fun story. The kind which reminds you that even the most elegant places can surprise you.

25 November 2025

A continuous feedback loop of media reporting, political opportunism, protest groups and social media algorithms are fuelling the spread of conspiracy theories rather than one specific cause, says new findings from the Researching Europe, Digitalisation and Conspiracy Theories (REDACT) project.

A series of reports published by the pan-European research project, led by Professor Clare Birchall, Professor of Contemporary Culture in the Department of English, shows how conspiracy theories differ by country due to social, historical and political factors.

The REDACT project is funded by CHANSE: a collaboration between 27 funding organisations from 24 countries. Fourteen researchers from around Europe produced seven reports looking into some of the unique aspects of how mis- and disinformation circulate online.

The newly launched reports feature specialised findings in Europe, including the UK; Germany, Austria and Switzerland; the Balkans; the Baltics; Slovakia; and Poland.

Conspiracy theories are not just a form of disinformation – they are deeply-rooted by a need for belonging and a sense of identity. Often people believe conspiracy narratives as part of their world view or way of life, so it's not possible to simply “take out” the incorrect pieces of information that they believe. This is made even harder by the feedback loop between the media, politicians, offline protest groups and social media.

Conspiracy thinking is not new. Yet in recent years, conspiracy theories have become increasingly widespread and normalised, rather than merely on the sidelines of society. Downplaying their impact or dismissing them does not make these theories disappear – it actually allows them to take up all the oxygen on a topic and dominate discussion.

Although conspiracy theories were once seen as existing on the fringes of society, the research shows that politicians and news coverage often contribute to these theories going viral. By bringing attention to the theories – even if only to comment on their inaccuracy – they spread to a wider audience through social media algorithms and mainstream media reports.

This creates a ‘feedback loop' between the internet, protest groups, political parties and mainstream media reporting, blurring distinctions between the online and offline spread of conspiracy theories.

An example of the feedback loop is seen in the Great Replacement conspiracy theory present across Europe. The report says that the rhetoric of populist politicians often uses dog whistles to hint at conspiracist accounts of non-white immigration to the extent that they are now some of the most important disseminators. The specifics of the conspiracy theory vary by country, but reflect anxiety about changing cultural values and demographics, even in spaces where levels of immigration are, in fact, low.

While Great Replacement talk certainly travels online, particularly on channels with lax or no moderation, its most influential disseminators are not social media pundits or the algorithms that amplify them but politicians using every platform available – both online and offline – to leverage anxiety about demographic change. This signals a shifting Overton window, where once-fringe ideas now shape political rhetoric.

While all the countries featured in the research do have connections to global conspiracist movements, they have their own forms of homegrown conspiracy culture too. This specificity must be considered when developing solutions, rather than importing a one-size-fits-all model from another country or region.

Many theories develop when people feel their genuine concerns are not listened to. For example, some people in the UK expressed worry about controls on individual freedom during the Covid lockdowns. This developed into fears around ‘15-minute cities', where conspiracists claimed people would be restricted in moving about their own towns.

Post-pandemic conspiracism is also marked by its agility… This allows conspiracism to evade moderation, feed alarmist media coverage and be exploited by populist politicians.

For German-speaking nations – Germany, Austria and Switzerland – believers seek out conspiracies online rather than coming across them by chance. Stigma around conspiracies remains from the aftermath of World War II when they moved to the margins of society, and their spread is common on the internet and in books. Often conspiracy theories emerge in the comments of a social media post rather than in the original post itself.

Lack of evaluation of efforts to tackle conspiracy theories and disinformation means there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of these initiatives. Disinformation and fact-checking services can become the subject of conspiracy theories too, which is a threat to the sector.

Voices have increasingly emerged that portray NGOs as part of a larger globalist plot, questioning both their independence and their good intentions. This greatly hinders the work of these organisations, as it can damage their reputation, lead to the suspension of funding streams, or – in the worst case – result in staff members being targeted with hate messages and threats.

The research uncovered differences between the status of conspiracy theories in Western and post-Soviet Europe largely due to histories of foreign occupation, conflict and the legacy of Soviet influence, which has understandably left suspicion of the state.

While the fear of the external enemy is strong, the fear of the internal traitor is perhaps the most significant difference between Eastern and Western European conspiracism.

History has significantly influenced the reasons for this. In the Baltics (Latvia and Estonia), fear of hidden elites and foreign control stems from Nazi and Soviet occupation. George Orwell's dystopian-novel, 1984, is referenced frequently by conspiracists online, as it resonates with the public's memories of repression, surveillance and censorship – which is used to add emotional force.

The role of history is also crucial to understand the situation in the Balkan triangle (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia), where the countries' linguistic and cultural closeness creates a ‘transnational conspiracist ecosystem'.

The legacy of the 1990s wars sustains a pervasive victimhood identity. Each community views itself as the historic casualty of external manipulation, making conspiracy explanations psychologically plausible and politically useful.

Unlike in Germany – where conspiracy theories are often relegated to fringe spaces – there is overlap with mainstream political and media narratives here. This has fed into interpretations of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, where news reports and political elites have invoked national traumas from the 1990s and lingering loyalties to other nations – reawakening nationalist leanings and a sense of threat.

In Poland, conspiracy theories do not always start online and have been pushed by politicians in the past. Popular conspiracies fixate on gender ideology and the LGBTQ+ community, labelling activists as national enemies akin to Nazi occupiers and Communists.

Fixation on these issues is imported from the US, rather than homegrown in Poland. Due to lack of evidence within their own country of conspiracist concerns being realised, users search online for ‘evidence' and examples that back up their claims.

Slovakia – a country with very high levels of conspiracist belief – also focuses conspiracy theories on gender and LGBTQ+ ideology. Discussion positions activists and international institutions as aiming to destroy the ‘“natural” family, religion and national sovereignty', leading to real life consequences through amendments to the constitution affecting the rights of women and the LGBTQ+ community.

More than a mere “culture war” or opinion-based opposition to rights, anti-gender and anti-LGBTQ discourses function as a political technology using conspiratorial claims with tangible effects on policy and civic freedoms.

There are a range of solutions to combatting conspiracy theories, such as improving media literacy, debunking, prebunking, and fact-checking. While none offer a complete solution, each has their place.

The research looked at the effectiveness of existing models to tackle the spread of conspiracies through interviews with fact-checkers, thinktanks and counter-disinformation organisations. REDACT found that solutions must be tailored to countries and regions in order to tackle the root causes of their local conspiracy theories.

Funding for the counter-disinformation sector can be patchy, with many organisations conscious of the optics of who they take money from. For example, receiving money from governments could be seen to impact an organisation's impartiality. This means financial support can be inconsistent.

According to the research, the onus remains on individuals to act responsibly unless a stronger regulatory stance is introduced. In the UK specifically, the findings suggest that the Online Safety Act 2023 needs to go further than what it offers in its current form and could learn from the robustness of the EU Digital Services Act.

The UK's offering focuses on illegal and harmful content but does not explicitly address health misinformation, election-related disinformation, or AI-generated content, leaving significant gaps in tackling systemic risks. In contrast, the EU's act imposes broader obligations, including risk assessments, transparency for political advertising, and measures against disinformation and algorithmic manipulation.

While the latter is stymied by the threat of tariffs from the US, REDACT's research suggests that it can in theory hold very large platforms accountable and has rules on how platforms should moderate content, including disinformation.

Although less comprehensive than the EU's Digital Services Act, the UK legislation offers more protection than US equivalents. The UK also lacks a constitutional free speech clause, removing a legal shield often cited in the US to defend disinformation. Nonetheless, British libel laws are often viewed as favouring wealthy plaintiffs over journalists.

While regulation might be letting users down, the research shows that they care deeply about the information environment. Alongside and in response to conspiracist posts, many users took the time to counter the claims. Such posts offer caution to alarmist accounts of uncontested, untrammelled conspiracism online.

Despite there being no easy answer, the researchers recommend addressing the wider politically rooted problems that contribute to the growing prominence of conspiracies. The research argues in favour of resistance against the normalisation of conspiracy theories in political discourse and the use of clickbait headlines in the media.

These ideas are spreading in all parts of society. If we want to tackle the problem of conspiracy theories, it's not enough to turn off a particular pipeline, such as putting restrictions on a specific social media platform or shutting down someone's account. We need to think about structural problems in society as well as the business models of platforms. And instead of focusing on why people don't trust institutions and politicians, we should work on making them worthy of trust.

About REDACT

The Researching Europe, Digitalisation and Conspiracy Theories (REDACT) project analyses how digitalisation shapes the form, content and consequences of conspiracy theories. Rather than see digitalisation as a process that has universal outcomes, or conspiracy theories as the same over space and time, REDACT considers online conspiracy theories and counter-publics in different European regions (Western Europe, Central Europe, the Baltics, and the Balkans) in order to make robust and nuanced recommendations about conspiracy theories for policy makers, media regulators, fact-checking and extremism-monitoring organisations, as well as the internet companies themselves.

REDACT is a cross-university, cross-country project bringing together academics from King's College London; the University of Manchester; Tübingen University; Lund University; the Slovak Academy of Sciences; the University of Tartu; Riga Technical University; Singidunum University; University of Banja Luka; Comenius University; the University of Zagreb.

In a landmark collaboration, India and Japan are joining forces to build one of the world's most ambitious astronomical instruments - the Thirty Metre Telescope (TMT). This cutting-edge optical-infrared telescope, with a massive 30-metre primary mirror, promises to revolutionise our understanding of the universe and could even answer humanity's most profound question: Are we alone?

The TMT project is an international partnership involving India, Japan, and two leading US universities. Its primary goal is to peer deeper into the cosmos than ever before, studying black holes, distant galaxies, and, most intriguingly, searching for signs of life beyond Earth.

"Astronomers want to have a bigger mirror to collect more light from the distant universe," explained Dr. Saku Tsuneta, Vice Chair of the Committee on National Space Policy at Japan's Cabinet Office, Tokyo. "The bigger the mirror, the more discoveries you can make about very distant objects."

The TMT's 30-metre mirror will dwarf existing telescopes, enabling unprecedented clarity and depth in observations. Unlike traditional telescopes with a single large mirror, TMT will use 500 precisely aligned smaller mirrors to form its giant primary mirror. This complex engineering feat requires cutting-edge technology-and that's where India plays a pivotal role.

"Instead of one large mirror, we have 500 smaller mirrors consisting of one 30-metre primary mirror," said Dr. Tsuneta. "The location and angle of each mirror has to be carefully adjusted. That has been done by Indian technology."

India's contribution lies in developing opto-mechanical systems that ensure these mirrors remain perfectly aligned, a critical requirement for the telescope's success. This collaboration underscores India's growing stature in global science and technology partnerships.

India is a founder-member partner in this project, which aims to open new windows to the universe through optical and infrared astronomy. Indian participation in this project was approved by the Union Cabinet in 2014. India's participation in the TMT collaboration involves three institutes: the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bengaluru, the Inter-University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, and the Aryabhatta Research Institute for Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital.

The chosen site for TMT is Mauna Kea in Hawaii, at an altitude of 4,000 metres – a location renowned for its clear skies and minimal atmospheric interference. Japan already operates an 8.2-metre telescope there, which has been delivering ground breaking observations for over 25 years.

"Our primary site for construction is Mauna Kea in Hawaii," Dr. Tsuneta confirmed. "This is one of the best sites for astronomical observation."

However, the project faces challenges. Mauna Kea is considered sacred by Native Hawaiian communities, leading to protests against construction. Negotiations are ongoing to address cultural concerns and seek consent.

"We don't want to build a telescope without their permission," Dr. Tsuneta emphasised. "It's an ongoing process."

Interestingly, alternative sites have been discussed, including Hanle in Ladakh, India, which already hosts a high-altitude observatory. While no decision has been made, the possibility reflects India's growing role in global astronomy.

The telescope's scientific agenda is vast. It will study black holes, map distant galaxies, and probe the early universe. But its most exciting mission is the search for extraterrestrial life.

"One of the important purposes is to find life on another planet other than Earth," said Dr. Tsuneta. "Astronomers believe there are other life forms elsewhere, distant from Earth. This telescope will find the signature of life forms in planetary systems belonging to other stars – not our Sun."

This means TMT will analyse exoplanets – planets orbiting stars outside our solar system – for chemical signatures that indicate life, such as water vapour or organic molecules.

The TMT is expected to be operational by the mid-2030s. Technological development is progressing well, thanks to contributions from partner nations, particularly India's precision engineering.

"Technologically, thanks to the Indian contribution, progress is in good shape," Dr. Tsuneta noted.

The implications of TMT's discoveries could be monumental. Detecting life beyond Earth would be one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of all time, potentially earning global recognition.

"If you find it, you will get a Nobel Prize," quipped Pallava Bagla during the conversation.

"I'm too old," laughed Dr. Tsuneta. "Younger people should get a Nobel Prize, not me. Obviously, the team should get it."

India-Japan: Partners in Space and BeyondThis collaboration builds on a strong history of India-Japan cooperation in space science. 

The two nations are already working together on LUPEX, a lunar exploration mission to search for water on the Moon. Now, with TMT, they aim to look for life among the stars.

India and Japan are old and good friends; they are together looking for water on the Moon through LUPEX and life on other stars using the Thirty Metre Telescope.

The TMT project represents more than just a scientific instrument – it's a symbol of international collaboration, technological innovation, and humanity's relentless curiosity. As India and Japan join hands to explore the cosmos, the dream of finding life beyond Earth moves closer to reality.

While Supernatural will always be known as a horror-fantasy series first and foremost, there's no denying that some of the most memorable of Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester's (Jensen Ackles) adventures are those that also include a little humor. With the series officially leaving Netflix mid-December, ending its longtime run on the streaming platform, there probably isn't time for a full Supernatural rewatch considering the show runs 15 seasons long with 327 episodes. So, instead of trying to make your way through the full show, some of the best episodes you could hunker down with are those more comedic hours that show us that Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki can do more than battle demons, monsters, and angels, but they can also make us laugh too.

Which episodes do we recommend you revisit? While "Changing Channels" is a fan-favorite and "Scoobynatural" is already a given, we recommend going back to Season 3's "Mystery Spot," Season 4's "Yellow Fever," and Season 10's "Fan Fiction" — and probably in that order. In a sense, these three episodes form an unofficial trilogy of comedic Winchester adventures that, although not connected directly by their respective seasons or circumstances, speak to many of the same issues that Sam and Dean face over and again. Not only are each of them stand-outs in their own respective seasons, but they each deal with similar themes of personal fears and failures while forcing the Winchesters through a routine case that turns out to be a bit more humorous (and out of the box) than they bargained for. On their own, each of these episodes rules, but together, we can see the progression.

Beginning with "Mystery Spot," this Sam-centric episode is your typical Groundhog Day-inspired fare, with Sam reliving the same horrible day over and over. For all the times that the Winchesters die on screen, this episode marks the most times Dean is killed on a single day. But what's fairly lighthearted and comedic at first turns into a waking nightmare for Sam, who continues to relive his worst fear again and again: not being able to save Dean. Because his elder brother had made a demon deal to bring him back to life a year prior, Sam decided that he would stop at nothing to get Dean out of it. "Mystery Spot" uses comedy and outrageous death scenes to speak to the heart of Sam's emotional turmoil throughout the third season — and it's no wonder he goes off the deep end a bit in the show's best season, Season 4.

Speaking of, for a Dean-focused episode, "Yellow Fever" is a great companion piece to "Mystery Spot." No, Dean doesn't get stuck in his own endless Tuesday time-warp, but he is forced to face his own fears when he contracts a spiritual ghost sickness that attaches itself to those of a certain personality type ("dicks," as Sam would say). Dean becomes cartoonishly afraid of everything this side of his own shadow, and the whole thing culminates for him when he is confronted by his greatest fear of all: his time in Hell between seasons. It's a harrowing revelation that Dean, contrary to what he told his younger brother, still remembers what happened down under, and he's terrified of getting back there again — and of losing Sam to his dark side along the way. In both episodes, each brother is forced to face his greatest fears, dealt with through humor and a levity that makes them easily digestible for the audience.

Of course, last but certainly not least is Season 10's "Fan Fiction." The show's 200th episode was always bound to be a memorable one, and it's the crown jewel of the three that plays to both previous episode's strengths by poking fun at the show's post-Kripke era, forcing Sam and Dean to uncomfortably confront some of the folks left behind after those early seasons. After so many years fighting, winning, losing, and stopping apocalypse after apocalypse, the two are confronted with the fact that — at least to some young schoolgirls — they're heroes. More than that, it's a fun way to revisit the horror of the early seasons as well as the show's complicated mythology, as the young ladies in charge of the Supernatural-themed musical remind the Winchesters (and us as well) why they love this story. Although Sam and Dean often fear that they don't do enough good, "Fan Fiction" puts those fears to rest.

Considering that Supernatural was always meant to be a horror show, we should note that these aren't the only episodes where the Winchesters encounter their deepest fears, challenges, or regrets. There are plenty of great episodes out there to binge, but if you're looking for some Supernatural highlights that really speak to the heart of the show while still making you laugh, these three are among the best. "Mystery Spot" includes some of the most iconic moments on the show, and was notorious for being Jared Padalecki's least favorite episode to film. "Yellow Fever" is not only downright hilarious, but it features Jensen Ackles singing "Eye of the Tiger" before the end credits roll. And as for "Fan Fiction," it's arguably the most meta episode (aside from, perhaps, "The French Mistake") that points to the flaws and inconsistencies within the show's continuity (like Jake Abel's Adam, who the brothers left in Hell after Season 5 and wouldn't return until Season 15).

For fans who love Supernatural, there is no shortage of episodes out there to revisit, but this unofficial trilogy of comedic Winchester hours collects some of the show's most memorable moments, from the early (and best) years of the horror-turned-fantasy program to the middling years when the Winchesters were forced to reinvent themselves. Plus, if you're anything like us, you've already binged through the entire show more than once, so why not just stop at some of these notable rest stops before the show leaves Netflix behind?

After being available for streaming exclusively on Netflix for, well, quite some time, it's strange to see Supernatural go. After all, the show is consistently one of the streamers' most-watched programs, and in an age where comfort shows often make more of a dent than million-dollar eight-episode productions, Supernatural will definitely be missed. There's a high chance that Sam and Dean will reappear on HBO Max since that's where the sequel/spin-off series The Winchesters is currently streaming, but no official announcement has been made. Those of us will home video copies won't be without the Winchesters for long, but here's hoping that they make their way to the streaming world again sometime soon — at least before Ackles and Padalecki get together for a revival season.

Supernatural is available to stream on Netflix until mid-December.
