                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Toby Wallace (Euphoria, Bikeriders) has become the first actor officially set as a series regular in Netflix's Assassin's Creed live-action series, based on Ubisoft's best-selling video game franchise. Wallace is said to be playing the co-lead in Assassin's Creed, a high-octane thriller centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions — one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters — said to be different from the games — across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny. 'One Piece' Reveals Cast Promotions & Who Is Returning In Season 3 As Production Kicks Off The series stems from a deal Netflix signed with Ubisoft in 2020. It is expected to start production in 2026 in Italy, which I hear serves as a setting of the series, with the exact time period unclear. Roberto Patino and David Wiener serve as showrunners. They executive produce with Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, Genevieve Jones for Ubisoft Film & Television, and Matt O'Toole. With more than 230 million units sold, the Assassin's Creed franchise is one of the best-selling series in video game history. He recently wrapped shooting HBO's Euphoria as a new Season 3 series regular. Wallace's recent feature credits include Jeff Nichols' The Bikeriders alongside Tom Hardy, Jodie Comer, and Austin Butler, Ron Howard's Eden alongside Jude Law and Sydney Sweeney, Charles Williams' Inside with Guy Pearce, as well as in Jusin Lin's Last Days. On TV, Wallace also starred in Danny Boyle's FX on Hulu limited series Pistol, in which he portrayed Sex Pistols' guitarist Steve Jones. Aussie Wallace, winner of the 2020 AACTA Best Lead Actor award and the 2019 Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best New Young Actor at the Venice Film Festival for Babyteeth, is repped by CAA, 3 Arts, CP Artist Management, and Sloane Offer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're getting a first look at Scarpetta, Prime Video‘s new forensic crime thriller based on Patricia Cornwell's bestselling Kay Scarpetta book series, starring Nicole Kidman in the title role. The streamer has released several first-look photos which you can see above and below. Kidman stars as Dr. Kay Scarpetta, an unrelenting medical examiner, who with skilled hands and an unnerving eye is determined to serve as the voice of the victims, unmask a serial killer, and prove that her career-making case from 28 years prior isn't also her undoing. Shane Black Movie 'Play Dirty' Is One Of Amazon MGM Studios' 10 Most Watched Pics On Prime With 57M Viewers As Scarpetta pursues justice, she must navigate complicated relationships, including the fraught dynamic with her sister Dorothy Farinelli (Jamie Lee Curtis), confront long-held professional and personal grudges, and face secrets that threaten to unravel everything she's built. In addition to Kidman and Curtis, Scarpetta stars Emmy winner Bobby Cannavale as Detective “Pete Marino,” with Emmy nominee Simon Baker as FBI profiler “Benton Wesley” and Oscar winner Ariana DeBose  as Kay's tech-savvy niece “Lucy Watson.” The series' dual timeline is completed by Rosy McEwen (Blue Jean), Amanda Righetti (The Mentalist), Jake Cannavale (The Offer), and Hunter Parrish (Weeds), who portray the past versions of Kidman, Curtis, Cannavale, and Baker's characters, respectively. Developed and written for television Liz Sarnoff, Scarpetta is executive produced by Kidman and Per Saari through Blossom Films, Curtis through Comet Pictures, writer and showrunner Sarnoff through Sarnoff TV, author Cornwell through P & S Projects, as well as Jason Blum, Jeremy Gold, Chris Dickie, and Chris McCumber through Blumhouse Television. David Gordon Green directed five episodes and also serves as executive producer alongside Amy Sayres. The series is produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Blumhouse Television in association with Blossom Films, Comet Pictures, and P&S Projects. Scarpetta premieres March 11 exclusive on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tara Reid is revealing the “scary” details surrounding her being allegedly drugged at a Chicago hotel bar over the weekend. “It made me pass out for eight hours.” The “American Pie” actress, 50, then alleged that she was transported from DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Chicago O'Hare Airport – Rosemont to a local hospital, where she “woke up eight hours later.” Reid also told the outlet that doctors did not perform a blood alcohol test, adding, “They just said that you were drugged. They said, ‘You got drugged last night at the bar. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. It was just a big blur,” the “Sharknado” actress added. Reid then issued a stark warning to men and women. “Everyone should really be aware about, you know, watching their drinks a lot because I don't know what that stuff was, but whatever it is, it knocked me out like immediately,” she said. Page Six has reached out to the “National Lampoon” star's rep for comment, but did not immediately hear back. Rosemont Public Safety Department Lieutenant Joseph Balogh told Page Six that no police report had been filed as of this publication — despite what Reid's rep said. However, he confirmed that his department received an EMS call for an ambulance, and the “patient was transported.” He said that there was “no other mention in any reports of it being drugs or suspicious activity.” Balogh told us that his department is currently not investigating Reid's claims; however, they will when a proper report is filed and the “victim comes forward.” “We're waiting for that on our end,” he told us. Page Six also reached out to the Doubletree for comment, but did not immediately hear back. On Monday, a video surfaced of an incoherent Reid being helped by hotel staff before being transported to a local hospital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. When Byron Howard and Rich Moore's smash hit (and eventual Best Animated Feature winner) “Zootopia” arrived in theaters in early 2016, the energetic and very funny fable turned a clever idea (a world only populated by mammals, but they sure act human!) into an enduring classic with some genuinely moving lessons to spare. Well, nine years on, and the fervor around the film‘s long-awaited first sequel has in no way diminished. They may also be feral for some similarly long-awaited retconning and clarifications. As smart and savvy as the film's original premise is, it came with plenty of unanswered questions, like “why just mammals” and “where the heck are the birds and reptiles” and “what's the deal with the crackling romantic chemistry between our two leads, who happen to be different species.” And while directors Jared Bush (who co-wrote the first film and became chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios in 2024) and the returning Howard don't answer all of these queries, they address many of them, and still manage to come away with a sparkling and inventive sequel. Related Stories Jon M. Chu Wants to Burst Your Bubble: Understanding Circles in ‘Wicked: For Good' Rising Distributor The Forge Picks Up Czech Smash Hit ‘Waves' Designed as a buddy cop outing, the first “Zootopia” saw the pair team up to take down a vast conspiracy that threatened the harmony of their home (and offered a sterling set of messages about the need for equality and understanding over racism and fear). But despite Nick and Judy's success — major enough that former con artist Nick has now officially joined the Zootopia Police Department to work alongside his zippy BFF — things just keep on moving in Zootopia. ), questions already abound regarding the sustainability of Judy and Nick's partnership. Are Nick and Judy really too different to succeed? (At 108 minutes, the film does occasionally feel a bit too long, though the constant introduction of new locales and whiz-bang jokes manages to prop up most moments of flailing interest.) Bush and Howard waste no time expanding the world of Zootopia, which is busy celebrating its “Zootennial,” a hundred years of harmony and prosperity within its heralded walls. And it's those walls we're about to hear plenty about, as Zootopia only really exists because of the clever construction of a series of “weather walls” that allow the numerous climates (and their mammal inhabitants) to co-exist side-by-side. Thank the powerful Lynxley family for such a gift, as everyone in Zootopia has long believed that Ebeneezer Lynxley was the one responsible for such a smart idea, and Zootopia itself. There is, however, one kind of weird thing about all that. The population of Zootopia doesn't, as legend has long held that Ebeneezer was nearly offed by a vicious viper just as he was preparing Zootopia and its weather walls. That viper even killed a beloved Lynxley family maid, a crime so heinous and so horrible that it led to the immediate banishment of every reptile in Zootopia, not just the snakes. That's why there are no reptiles in Zootopia. Except, well, Judy and Nick have maybe just found one. Intent on proving the viability of their partnership, Judy and Nick alight on yet another case that puts the health and happiness of every Zootopia inhabitant on the line. Following the proud lineage of films like “Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo” and “Step Up Revolution,” the real baddie of “Zootopia 2” is out-of-control property development and evil business tycoons. All of Zootopia might be thrilled about the upcoming expansion of Tundratown, but no one seems at all concerned about what needs to be destroyed to make that happen. Not Chief Bogo, not newly installed handsome horse mayor Brian Winddancer (voiced by Patrick Warburton), not even the Big family, little Arctic shrew mafiosos who know a thing or two about being hunted. And that means Nick has to care, too. But as they zip through Zootopia, encountering new friends (like the Fortune Feimster-voiced beaver Nibbles Maplestick, obsessed with conspiracy theories) and new locations (like Marsh Market, a Disney-fied mash-up of Florida and New Orleans) along the way, their differences become more pronounced. And when that pit viper, who we soon learn is named Gary De'Snake (voiced by Ke Huy Quan), keeps popping up with a very new version of Zootopia's history, even Judy and Nick seem breakable. That's not to imply that “Zootopia 2” isn't funny, zippy, and highly enjoyable — it is indeed — but it's also got the kind of heart that has too long seemed to be missing from other Disney animated offerings. There's real care behind the bond between Nick and Judy. There's an absolutely incredible “The Shining” montage that will delight parents and terrify children for decades to come. Yes, and we can't wait for the next one to take wing (wink). Disney will release “Zootopia 2” in theaters on Wednesday, November 26.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, she's combining the two aspects of her life by introducing her adorable little one, two-year-old Adira, to tennis. Taking to Instagram on Monday, November 24, Serena — who is married to Alexis Ohanian and is also the mother to older daughter Olympia — shared a series of photos of herelf on a bright blue tennis court surrounded by trees. With her on the court is Adira, looking tiny, adorable and ready to play. In the caption, Serena wrote, “This is me sharing my passion for tennis with my youngest daughter.” While playing tennis with Adira as a toddler is surely a memory that Serena will keep forever, it's also a sweet moment that her fans are happy that she shared. Beyond that, they're thrilled to see the little one exploring her mom's sport. One person wrote, “I think she is the one to carry on that tennis greatness and create her own legacy.” “If your daughters play tennis it would be epic and a legit reincarnation 🤏🏾💞❤️,” came from another follower. Someone else left a comment saying, “Awww 😍😍🥺💕 2040 USOPEN CHAMPION! “She'll be a champion like you… it's in her blood,” another person wrote. If Adira does decide to pursue tennis, she'll be entering a super competitive world. Fortunately, her mom says that she's already pretty darn strong. “Olympia is a very hard act to follow, but I tell you what, Adira has followed it and it's just so crazy,” Serena told People in November 2024. “I just can't wait for people to see how amazing she is in her own way. And I am so obsessed with Olympia. However, she added, “It's so funny how, I don't know, just your heart gets bigger. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Wisely, the folks behind the “Sinners” campaign took a beat to let other contenders schedule screenings, Q&As, and receptions around the Governors Awards, which is primetime for gathering Academy members back to Los Angeles, and set their events for midway through the following week, when things had died down.

Similarly scheduled far in advance of any awards conversations was an event organized around Michael B. Jordan accepting the American Cinematheque Award later that Thursday night at The Beverly Hilton, home of the Golden Globes ceremony. After speeches from stars Jordan has shared the screen with, like Tessa Thompson, Daniel Kaluuya, and Octavia Spencer, as well as more unexpected presenters like Mahershala Ali, Ben Affleck, and Bradley Cooper, it was the previously reserved Coogler who most successfully lightened the mood. “I'm really upset because I never had to follow up that many incredible actors before,” said the filmmaker, referencing how he was even preceded by his Oscar-nominated “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” star Angela Bassett popping on screen to send Jordan well wishes. “I'm about to go on stage and they're like, ‘Hold on, it's a video,' and it's fucking Tom Cruise.” Coogler had little to worry about, as his stories of the decade-plus he and Jordan have worked together on five films was one of the highlights of the night, equally as funny as it was informative about what makes the “Sinners” star a great actor. For example, to help distinguish between the twins, he borrowed a technique from the making of “The Godfather” and wore shoes that were a size too small for Stack, “so he was never comfortable,” and a size too big for Smoke, “so he wouldn't move unless it was necessary.” Coogler ended his speech by saying “even the brightest stars start off from the ground up in blue collar positions. Every single one of these incredible actors that came up and spoke, producers that came up and spoke, none of them had Hollywood connections before they started. That sentiment about finding success from any background extended into Jordan's own acceptance speech. Nobody really talks about how to build,” said the actor and filmmaker. At his production company, Outlier Society, “we always say to build a house and they'll come. And we've been building this house for a while.” Jordan added that, early in his career, he asked himself, “‘Who could I be? Jordan thanked the director for changing his life, and said, “We took risks. Kids saw themselves on the screens in ways they hadn't before. Prior to presenting the key to Proximity Media founders Ryan and Zinzi Coogler and Sev Ohanian, Warner Bros. Motion Picture chairs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy gave speeches where the latter said, “This has been one of the most extraordinary experiences ever,” in reference to “Sinners,” and that the producers “are visionaries, they are passionate, they are loyal, they are some of the greatest people I've ever met and have gotten to know, and I will forever be blessed and privileged to have this experience.” Looking toward the future, De Luca said, “We're so up for anything you guys want to do. While Ohanian and Zinzi Coogler expressed how their experience making “Sinners” validated their company's mission to create cinematic events that draw audiences closer to overlooked subjects, and also proved what Proximity could accomplish as the sole production company on a project, the film's director addressed De Luca and Abdy directly, saying “so much of this is about timing. It took me my whole life to make this movie over a decade, to process the death of my uncle who inspired it. And I was so happy that it worked out for us to have this company, to have this screenplay, to have all these relationships at the same time that you guys got the power of one of the legacy studios.” He continued, “I know you guys are lovers of cinema. And at this time where so much was at stake, both of you guys individually and for the industry, it was awesome to have the ball in our hands for an opportunity to get folks out to the theaters. And you guys believed in us the entire time. The trio's arrangement of “I Lied to You,” the centerpiece song that precedes “Sinners” most talked-about musical moment, is extremely savvy. Though it took a second for the lively audience to quiet down, Caton and Smith's dynamic vocal performances more than made the case for “Sinners” to have both songs make it into the category, if not spoil what has long been expected to be a “Golden” victory. Later in the night, Göransson's wife Serena, who was the executive music producer on “Sinners,” brought Smith back out for a dazzling rendition of “I Put a Spell on You,” and blues legend Buddy Guy, who makes a cameo in the film, even hopped on the small stage to perform a song. This one weekend of effort felt like enough to stake away any concerns that “Sinners” will have a tough time being a major Oscars contender. But, at this point, the film exceeding expectations is nothing new. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The two stars will release 'Better Late Than Never' together on Nov. 28. How did they manage to keep it a secret? He's not sick, just determined to avoid being recognized as he enters our New York studios, and immediately heads to his dressing room with his small entourage. Minutes later, Prince Royce walks through the door, just as quickly and discreetly, with a cap under the hood of his sweater covering half his face. Today, the last Wednesday of October, they're here to announce something completely different: Romeo Santos and Prince Royce, the “king” and “prince” of bachata, respectively, are finally collaborating, not on a single song, but on an entire album. Appropriately titled Better Late Than Never, the 13-song album will arrive Nov. 28 on Sony Music Latin, where only a small group of people knew of its existence. Close friends and family were also unaware. The result is pure synergy: “There's no one taking center stage here,” Santos says. I listened to the album the day before, when Santos — as he's done in the past with Billboard — picked me up in a Cadillac Escalade V and played it for me from beginning to end, responding to my questions and reactions with the joy of someone who knows he has something special in his hands. He's never been one to share files of his work through email before their release, and he certainly wasn't going to risk it this time. Better Late Than Never has the essence of Santos and Royce throughout but also offers something fresh for both artists. There are classic bachatas, more modern takes and mostly romantic lyrics, and the fusion of their recognizable voices is captivating from the first track, which shares the album's title. Songs such as “Dardos” and “Jezebel” stand out, the latter displaying strong R&B influences, as well as “Ay San Miguel,” a Dominican palo, and “Menor,” a surprising first collaboration for Santos with an emerging talent, Dalvin La Melodía — who also hadn't yet been informed about Royce's participation. Santos and Royce wrote four of the songs together, starting with “Mi Plan,” penned during a friends trip to St. Barts in 2023, and “Better Late Than Never,” “Jezabel” and “Loquita Por Mí.” The rest were mostly written by Santos, always with Royce's participation and honest input. But the seed of this production has been germinating since at least 2017, when they recorded the first of three failed attempts that will likely never see the light of day. “I don't want to sound cliché or overly religious, but God's timing is perfect,” Santos says, explaining why now was the right time. “When we started recording the first song seven years ago, there was a little resistance from both of us. “There was a moment where I said, ‘Man, are we ever going to find that fusion, that muse, where we both feel comfortable and can say, ‘This is great?' On Oct. 31, Halloween, Santos, unrecognizable in an Ace Ventura costume, announced on his Instagram account “new album November 28” — with a link in his bio to preorder it — along with a video of him partying in New York with an album in his hands. Days later, on Nov. 10, a massive listening party for his fans scheduled for Nov. 26 at Madison Square Garden was announced on Univision shows such as Despierta América and El Gordo y La Flaca and radio station WXNY-FM (La X 96.3) New York, where listeners could call in to win tickets. According to Santos' publicist, at the time of the announcement, 7,000 people were online looking for tickets, all assuming that “it's a [solo] Romeo album.” Of course, there were no singles or previews. A music video featuring two songs — “Estocolmo” and “Dardos” — will be released simultaneously with the album. Superstars of the genre from different generations, they are also very different in style — Santos with his sweet, high-pitched voice and use of traditional guitars; Royce with his light lyric tenor and a more pop/urban sound. Santos, 44, revived bachata when it was considered traditional regional music, giving it a sensual twist with touches of contemporary New York that captivated a new generation. Royce, 36, came later with bachata versions of Motown classics. Santos rose to fame in the mid-1990s as leader of the group Aventura before launching a brilliant solo career in 2011 with Fórmula, Vol. 1, the longest-running bachata album by a solo artist on Billboard's Top Latin Albums chart (17 weeks at No. Royce debuted in 2010 with a self-titled set that reached No. 1 on Top Latin Albums, which he has topped five times. Both born in the Bronx to Dominican parents (except for Santos' mother, who is Puerto Rican), they met at a family party. “Aventura was huge at the time,” Royce recalls. I heard the revolú [commotion], so many people outside. I went out and took a picture [with him],” adding that he was starstruck by the singer's presence. What Romeo and Aventura have done has inspired me.” “Romeo Santos and Prince Royce are two wonderful artists, two exceptional professionals — and even better human beings — who have dedicated their careers to bringing bachata to the world,” Afo Verde, chairman/CEO of Sony Music Latin Iberia, told me days after the interview. We can't wait for all the fans to experience this magical album they've created together.” Sitting down to talk for the first time about their most closely guarded secret in an exclusive interview with Billboard Español, Santos and Royce delve into the project, their friendship and the future of the genre that made them famous. Romeo Santos: I'd like to take credit, but the truth is, the first person to mention the idea of recording not one, not two, but a whole album, was this gentleman right here. And that was literally seven years ago, right? I felt a lot of pressure from the public, really. If we make a song, what will it be? And I was thinking about how to fuse these two worlds, which, although it's bachata, are two different styles of bachata. I always thought, “Man, how iconic would it be if we made an album, if we could give everyone these different kinds of flavors and colors?” When he says “the pressure,” it's like a song will have an audience who will say, “I like this one,” but there will be another type of fan who will say, “Yes, but it's too slow.” There are those who say, “Yes, but it's too fast.” “Yes, but it doesn't have that bitterness or it's too depressing.” We have a production that fills all the gaps. After three attempts, what motivated you to keep trying and not give up? How could the chorus of these three songs be improved? The best songs we were able to create are on this album. Royce: I think for me it was, “We shouldn't rush things.” Nowadays a lot of people lack patience, and I've always been very patient. He was honest with me about those three songs. I mean, if he had been a hypocrite and told me, “They're great,” this project wouldn't have happened. But he was like, “I don't know, loco, they're OK, but do you think so?” So I kind of analyzed them. And honestly, every time I presented him with a song, I felt it was better than the last one. How is it possible that none of this leaked in all these years? I feel very comfortable, even if it's a little stressful, working on projects with the element of surprise. Royce: In my case, I just don't want to jinx it either. For me it was such an important project that I wanted the element of surprise, I wanted to surprise the audience, I wanted to focus on the project without anyone interfering and simply work. I think that when people saw those pictures and didn't hear any music, they kind of overlooked it. And I didn't know at the time that this was also what would work as a strategy for us. We managed to keep it a secret for several reasons. Also because technology has changed so radically these days that you can record a production, an album, whatever at home. We didn't go to public studios; everything was recorded during vacations — we were in a villa with our friends and family, in my home studio in New York. Royce: I called it the “Bora Project” with my small team. Santos: We created this “Batman” and “Robin” thing, but for different aspects; for filming music videos, talking to the director: “Remember, Royce is Robin, I'm Batman.” Until it became second nature. Now I say to him: “What's up, Robin?” Santos: Look, I'm very grateful to Afo [Verde], to the whole Sony team really, but Afo is one of those people who respects the creative side of artists. And I remember sending Afo a message about two months ago, more or less, saying, “Brother, I have a project that I think is going to excite you. I want you to listen to it, to be one of the first.” Afo tells me, “I knew you were planning something,” because my last post was, if I'm not mistaken, on Jan. 8 of this year, and I've been ghosting on social media. How easy or difficult was it working together as two big artists with such distinctive styles? It was like there was a whole year where I felt like we were creating something incredible. And I really admire how he pushed me in the studio. Royce: I hadn't felt like that in a long time. The fact that I thought I was doing well and [he'd tell me], “No, you can do better, bro,” and just keep at it… Santos: And vice versa, because I'm so used to directing myself that sometimes you overlook certain things you stop doing as a performer. … The interesting thing about this project is that it has his essence, my essence, but musical proposals that neither of us has offered to the fans before. So I went in already with that challenge. Royce: There are new elements like “Dardos,” which has a lot of fusion. [The song] “Better Late Than Never” starts off very pop, a cappella. And I think there are many elements, within bachata as well, in the way the guitar is played; there's a bit of a rock flow. For me, it has been an honor to record this album. It has been a very beautiful experience in the studio as well. Santos: You know what I used to tell him? “This pendejo sings beautifully!” Because I was listening to him from a different perspective. And sometimes he sang a melody even better than what I envisioned. Were you already a fan of Prince Royce's music? For me, “Incondicional” is one of those songs that, if you ask me what Romeo hasn't done in bachata, both with Aventura and as a solo artist, when I heard that song I said, “F–k, mariachi with bachata!” That was great. I've always been a fan of “La Novelita” by Aventura. “Infieles.” “Eres Mía”… I think he's a walking encyclopedia of bachata; he knows every bachata song and has a lot of musical knowledge. As friends and colleagues, do you ever call each other for advice? We've talked a lot long before this project. Royce: There are many that I probably can't say on camera. In terms of advice — not just musical; it could be business, it could be personal — we've had many conversations and he's always been, I really mean it, very real with me… And I've always respected that. Santos: I can tell you that one piece of advice he gave me once was, “Don't take things so seriously.” I have that problem. Especially when you have a plan, the rollout, marketing, a million things, and I feel like he has that quality. Santos: Yeah, sometimes that kind of takes away the fun. How do you see the genre right now? Santos: How far the genre has come is impressive, especially when you see artists who aren't bachata singers navigating this genre of heartbreak. When I listen to Rosalía, Manuel Turizo, Maluma, Shakira, Rauw Alejandro, Karol G, that's an excellent sign that good work has been done since the beginning. However, a superstar on the level of Romeo Santos and Prince Royce hasn't emerged. Santos: I think there are a lot of Prince Royces and Romeos in an attic, in a basement, creating the new sound. If you analyze my career, people remember Aventura from “Obsesión,” but we'd been hard at work six years prior to that. And I think that nowadays it's very important to be different… and to bring something that Romeo Santos didn't bring and that Prince Royce didn't bring, because they're already here. Going back to your wonderful project, an album is usually followed by a tour. Do you plan to go on the road together? Santos: Obviously, yes, we are considering a tour, God willing, and a worldwide one so people can enjoy both of our repertoires. And when it happens, God willing, we don't want it to feel like a show where he goes onstage, sings his setlist, then I sing mine. Santos: You want to know what I'd tell his fans? No, but seriously, this is a treat, a gift for both sets of fans, because I think — and I don't want to sound repetitive — that it's a production where each song is dedicated to different styles, to his essence, to mine. Maybe your favorite part of this particular song is Royce's chorus, and maybe your favorite part is the pre-hook I did, but I hope you like it, that it evokes some kind of emotion in you in a positive way, because we made it with all the love we could put into a project.

In a new interview with The Town‘s Matt Belloni (via World Of Reel), Cameron offered some words of encouragement toward Netflix's theatrical strategy: It's “rotten to the core,” and the movies they produce shouldn't be allowed within 10 feet of an Oscar statuette unless they get a release in “2,000 theaters for a month.” Yeesh, Jim, tell 'em how you really feel. The topic arose as Belloni asked Cameron about reports of Netflix and Paramount's recent bids to buy Warner Bros. Cameron gave his recommendation to Paramount because “Netflix would be a disaster. Sarandos has gone on the record saying theatrical films are dead. '” When Belloni told Cameron that Sarandos was “promising theaters if he buys Warner Bros.,” Cameron replied: “It's sucker bait. ‘We'll put the movie out for a week or 10 days. See, I think that's fundamentally rotten to the core. A movie should be made as a movie for theatrical, and the Academy Awards mean nothing to me if they don't mean theatrical. He's not the first to criticize this strategy either, since the streamer only instituted it so its movies would be eligible for awards, and, well, stars and filmmakers want their films in theaters. In 2019, Steven Spielberg lobbed the same criticism at Netflix. I don't believe films that are just given token qualifications in a couple of theaters for less than a week should qualify for the Academy Award nomination.” Cameron offers Netflix a path forward on the Oscar nominations, though: “They should be allowed to compete if they put the movie out for a meaningful release in 2,000 theaters for a month.” Lynne Ramsay makes traumatic films you can reach out and touch By Kayleigh Donaldson November 13, 2025 | 3:00pm</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After 25 years on the force, Ice-T has been noticeably absent from the 27th season of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Talking to TMZ, Ice-T explains that he only appears in four of the season's eight episodes because the show can't afford both him and the returning Kelli Giddish. At the end of the day, they couldn't keep both of us on both times, as far as budget-wise.” Giddish's character, Detective Amanda Rollins, had been written off in season 24, but star Mariska Hargitay fought for her return, and Detective Benson gets what she wants. Ice-T says that producers told him, “We'll have you come in and out this year” because “everybody wanted Kelli back” and the show hired “new cops.” Rest assured, he's not leaving the show.”I am more concerned with going to Season 28,” he continues. “This year, they said, ‘Ice, we're going to work you a little less.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>First, he became a husband in June, marrying his real-life leading lady and “When Calls the Heart” co-star Erin Krakow, to the delight of Hearties everywhere. In “The Christmas Cup,” Rosenbaum stars opposite longtime Hallmark star Rhiannon Fish, who plays Staff Sergeant Kelly Brandt, a Marine sidelined at home by a knee injury. As she bides her time by leading her hometown team in the annual Christmas Cup, she receives help — and a new perspective on life — from Rosenbaum's character, Fire Captain Quinn Stokley. Rosenbaum, who has played Mike Hickam on WCTH since the show began in 2014, first revealed in September that he'd be leading his first Hallmark Christmas movie. The excitement from WCTH fans since then has not gone unnoticed, Rosenbaum told EntertainmentNow. “Oh my goodness, yes, I am feeling the love,” he said. For years, it feels like now, there have been fans of ‘When Calls the Heart' who have taken a particular shine to mycharacter, Hickam. But despite all the love coming from fans, Rosenbaum sweetly acknowledged, “There's no bigger cheerleader for me than my wife.” Just as Krakow is Rosenbaum's biggest fan, he told EntertainmentNow he was smitten with Krakow's gifts as an actress from the first time they worked together in 2009. “Honestly, when Erin and I first met, I actually saw her working the first time we met, and really just developed a crush on her talent,” Rosenbaum said. Krakow was cast as Cecily in “The Importance of Being Earnest” and he was an understudy for the characters of Algernon and Jack. The two became friends during the production, Rosenbaum said, “and then shortly thereafter, after production ended and she went back to New York, I was doing a national tour that started and ended in New York. So we had more opportunities to connect, and a romance developed from there.” Krakow, who stars as Elizabeth Thornton on WCTH, has also starred in her fair share of Hallmark movies, including 2025's highly anticipated holiday flick “Christmas Above the Clouds” opposite Tyler Hynes. “I'd rather stay away from any competition with her,” he chuckled. As for whether the two might collaborate on a future movie, Rosenbaum told EntertainmentNow, “I think that would be really fun.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Healthy adults that these people knew were coming down with unexplained medical conditions, including diseases and cancers that usually afflicted the elderly. Sixty years old, broad-chested, with a salt-and-pepper goatee, Doherty had been running a cattle ranch business with his wife for 25 years when he entered public service in 2016, winning a seat on Morrow County's three-person board of commissioners. Doherty knew what they meant: The county's underground water supply had been tainted with nitrates — a byproduct of chemical fertilizers used by the megafarms and food processing plants where most of his constituents worked. Water hadn't really been a political priority for Doherty — he's a Republican, and he focused mostly on economic development and transportation projects — until a couple of years into his second term, when the uptick of stories he heard about young women enduring miscarriages and middle-aged men with organ failure started making him uneasy. Scientists believe that excess consumption of even a small amount of nitrates can do significant harm to the human body; they can cause debilitating conditions in newborns and have been linked to increased risks of cancer. In June 2022, he decided to do something about it. He went out and collected tap water samples from six homes he chose at random and sent them to a nearby laboratory. The lab called a few days later and explained that it was their policy to notify anyone with a sample that tested above the federal limit for the presence of nitrates in drinking water — 10 parts per million. Doherty asked which family was going to receive the bad news about their water. It wasn't one of the homes he visited that had a toxic well. Doherty says he picked up 70 more test kits and went back out a week later, this time knocking on doors across a wider swath of the county. When Doherty collected the water samples, accompanied by an official with the county health office, they'd taken an informal survey. Talking mostly to farmhands and factory workers who were reliant on well water, they asked if anyone in their household had one or more of the known medical conditions linked to nitrate exposure. According to Doherty, within the first 30 homes they visited, they heard of at least 25 miscarriages and a half dozen people living with one kidney. “One man about 60 years old had his voice box taken out because of a cancer that only smokers get,” Doherty says, “but that guy hadn't smoked a day of his life.” He never thought parents in the area would be terrified that their children might sneak a glass of poisonous water from the kitchen sink. Benedict Cumberbatch Talks Grief, Toothbrushes, and His Latest Amazon Holiday Campaign Inside 'Patriot,' the Cult-Favorite Spy Caper You Should Be Watching “The historical precedent here is Flint, Michigan,” says Kristin Ostrom, executive director of Oregon Rural Action (ORA), a water rights advocacy group. “In part because of how slow the response to the crisis has been, and in part because of who's affected. These are people who have no political or economic power, and very little knowledge of the risk.” AMAZON OPENED MORROW COUNTY'S first “hyperscale” data center in 2011 — nearly 10,000 square feet of warehouse space filled with rows of computer servers. Amazon's presence lent Big Tech cachet to the county's industrial district and diversified its investment portfolio away from a reliance on agriculture. Eager to compete with other rural communities looking to host data center campuses, local officials had offered Amazon a 15-year tax abatement for each hyperscale data center it built, which would be worth billions to the company. Amazon has since constructed seven such facilities in the area, with agreements for five more underway. There was good reason for Amazon to set itself up in a place like Morrow County. But the company faces stiff competition from Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and Google. S&P predicts that demand for new construction is expected to double by 2030, most of it in rural counties like Morrow that are otherwise reliant on agriculture. But data centers pose a variety of climate and environmental problems, including their impact on the water supply. This year, a Bloomberg News analysis found that roughly “two-thirds of new data centers built or in development since 2022 are in places already gripped by high levels of water stress.” Droughts have plagued Morrow County, occurring annually since 2020. But even areas with ample water reserves are vulnerable to the outsized demand from data centers. Earlier this year, the International Energy Agency reported that data centers could consume 1,200 billion liters by 2030 worldwide, nearly double the 560 billion liters of water they use currently. The issue is pollution, which Amazon's data centers have exacerbated since their arrival. In response to a request for comment, Amazon spokesperson Lisa Levandowski replied that “the apparent narrative” of this story “is misleading and inaccurate.” Levandowski went on to say: “The truth is that this region has long-documented groundwater quality challenges that significantly predate AWS' presence, and federal, state, and local agencies have spent years working to address nitrates from agricultural fertilizer, manure, septic systems, and wastewater from food processing plants. Our data centers draw water from the same supply as other community members; nitrates are not an additive we use in any of our processes, and the volume of water our facilities use and return represents only a very small fraction of the overall water system — not enough to have any meaningful impact on water quality.” “One man about 60 years old had his voice box taken out because of a cancer only smokers get, but that guy hadn't smoked a day of his life.” Essentially desert country, its porous, sandy soil is inhospitable to all but a few types of shallow-root crops. Yet over the past few decades, it was transformed by a group of entrepreneurial local officials and farm operators who leveraged chemical fertilizers to make the desert bloom. Increased water flow meant large agricultural companies could use fertilizers in fields year-round. Lamb Weston, which supplies virtually all of the potatoes for McDonald's french fries, set up shop. For some wells, DEQ found nitrate levels nearly as high as 73 ppm, more than 10 times the state limit of 7 ppm. It is a novel recycling process that alleviates the Port's wastewater burden and offers farms a steady flow of highly concentrated fertilized water to expand their industrial-ag footprints. “The aquifer is basically one giant sandbox, and the water flows through there very quickly,” says Chad Gubala, a hydrologist who managed Oregon DEQ's oversight of the Port of Morrow's wastewater permit from 2018 to 2022. “This idea of winter irrigation was the goofiest thing on God's green earth,” he says. “The farmers and the Port facility folks argued that maintaining irrigation during a non-growing season was a reasonable thing to keep the soil ‘in appropriate condition' they called it, so it'd be ready for spring seed sowing and early growth. Well, it was functionally a load of shit, a way to maintain year-round discharge of wastewater from their facilities.” (In an Oct. 30 press release, the Port pledged to end the practice this winter. The Port's executive director, Lisa Mittelsdorf, told Rolling Stone in a statement, “The Port and DEQ have worked together to ban non-growing season land application of industrial wastewater.”) The winter irrigation practice “provides a significant risk to … to groundwater,” Larry Brown, a DEQ environmental health specialist, wrote in an email in 2023, summarizing concerns he had shared with DEQ administrators a year earlier. Soon, Amazon was using water to cool its data warehouses with nitrates as high as 13 ppm — above the federal and state limits. That means that when the polluted water has moved through the data centers and back into the wastewater system, it's even more contaminated, sometimes averaging as high as 56 ppm, eight times Oregon's safety limit. ON JUNE 9, 2022, JIM DOHERTY called a public hearing for the county commission to vote on a state of emergency for the county's drinking water. “The historical precedent here is Flint, Michigan, in part because of who's affected. These are people with no political or economic power and little knowledge of the risk.” “Our legacy will be what we are doing now,” Doherty said of the emergency decree. The county, he argued, needed to unlock emergency funds to buy bottled water for anyone living with tainted wells and provide test kits to the thousands of residents who didn't yet know if they were drinking polluted water. Melissa Lindsay was one of Doherty's fellow county commissioners, elected the same year as him. Kate Brown a few days earlier, and she'd offered emergency assistance without strings attached. “She did not say they would come run our county,” Doherty said. Doherty says one farm manager spent 15 minutes at a second meeting telling him “what a godawful person I was for trying to shut down farming and the local ag industry.” “The safe drinking water of our constituents is  number one,” Lindsay said. Health officials began distributing bilingual flyers that warned wells could be tainted, advising that “residents who have a high level of nitrate in their well water should not boil their water. Brown didn't release a statement supporting the county. Doherty suspected that the lobbyists representing Morrow County business interests were working behind the scenes to thwart an aggressive state-level intervention. “That was the mafia mentality at work,” he says. Brown declined to directly address these allegations, instead suggesting Rolling Stone file a public records request.) “[To] move the needle on reducing contamination to healthy levels … it's going to take work and creative solutions from farmers, ranchers, homeowners, really anyone who uses water or land in this area,” a DEQ spokesperson said that June. By September 2022, 248 additional homes had been found to have nitrate levels above the state's safety limit. At another packed town hall meeting, “county leaders and people with contaminated wells expressed growing frustration at the lack of direct intervention from the state in public testimony,” one local newspaper wrote in its coverage. Some immigrants in the area, many of whom are undocumented, were reluctant to seek help. According to several sources with direct knowledge of the incidents, managers at several of the food processing plants and farm operations were telling employees that the emergency declaration was a bad-faith campaign that would endanger their jobs. Gathering at town halls or speaking about the pollution to reporters was tantamount to inviting the shutdown of your place of employment. Doherty tried to counter the disinformation: “We need you. But as word continued to spread across the county that residents had potentially been drinking contaminated water for years, if not decades, Doherty was besieged with emails, texts, and Facebook messages from concerned residents who encouraged him to fight the pollution. Another person contacted him who had just moved away. Some of the larger agriculture operators in the area, including Tillamook Creamery and Lamb Weston, offered financial support to people who needed water. (Tillamook did not reply to multiple requests for comment on this story from Rolling Stone. Lamb Weston replied in a statement that “while only a very small percent of nitrates, as confirmed by the Oregon DEQ, are attributable to the land application of food processing water, we are committed to doing our part to protect safe drinking water in the region. “[Local officials] knew from the get-go how big Amazon would become in Morrow County. “This has been a community issue for decades and it is past time to address the issue on a regional basis. The Port is eager to play its role in finding workable solutions.” Lisa Mittelsdorf, executive director of the Port, said in an email to Rolling Stone that the “DEQ has consistently acknowledged Port operations have had minimal effect on nitrate levels in the basin's groundwater.” Since 2011 Oregon DEQ has issued more than a thousand violations and more than $3 million in fines against the Port for excessive spraying of nitrate-laden water over farmland. Amazon pitched in money as well, “to help neighbors, families, and workers impacted by the water emergency,” as the company put it in a press release. “Is there any risk in having our name in this, or any reason why we wouldn't do this?” one staffer wrote, according to a review of hundreds of internal emails obtained through a public records request. “There is always potential for some risk of affiliation with the causation,” Amazon director of public policy Roger Wehner wrote, though he underscored how the company's donation would “also offer an opportunity to position AWS [as] an engaged corporate citizen doing good for the community.” Being seen as an “engaged corporate citizen” would be helpful to Amazon as it negotiated for the next round of multibillion-dollar tax abatements from Morrow County's business development committee for building out five new data centers. “This is a rare, highly impactful opportunity (could critically help influence $2b incentives) in our 2nd largest region globally. “Our absence … will be noted not only by the public but also very important stakeholders who 1) hold the keys to $2B of tax abatements currently in negotiation for the business 2) gate keep for key land acquisitions to meet supply needs, and 3) facilitate our permitting and water/fiber infrastructure approvals,” wrote one AWS team member. “All of which are very critical for our continued success.” Amazon spokesperson Lisa Levandowski characterized the use of these quotes from the emails as “misleading,” adding, “We have been investing and creating jobs in eastern Oregon since before the launch of our data centers there. Doherty wasn't surprised by the corporate messaging and philanthropic support by Amazon and the other major industrial players in Morrow County. It was in their interest to curry favor with the public, particularly if it meant they could avoid any commitment to altering the wastewater management practices that continued to exacerbate the crisis. But it wasn't just the C-suite executives who were keeping a close eye on Doherty's emergency declaration. Behind the scenes, powerful local officials were coordinating their own response. MORROW COUNTY'S TRANSFORMATION from a rural backwater into an agricultural powerhouse is, in many ways, the work of a single man. Gary Neal was elected general manager of the Port of Morrow in 1989, when the waterfront terminal was still a modest operation. Over the course of more than 30 years, utilizing grants and revenue bonds to finance infrastructure investments, Neal built miles of rail track at the Port to ship exports out to the Union Pacific line. Hundreds of acres of land owned by the Port were rezoned for industrial use, hooked up to new water and waste pipes, and powered by substations installed near the Port after Neal lobbied the local utilities. Creating plug-and-play spaces for new industrial tenants allowed Neal to court increasingly larger businesses to sites that had “all the services” they could need, he said during one board meeting. By 2017, the Port was doing $2.8 billion in annual business. In 2019, state lawmakers passed a resolution honoring Neal, noting that when he had taken over the Port “the local economy was in rough shape with high unemployment” and that through his “vision and leadership,” it was now “one of the most productive areas in the state of Oregon.” Neal's pumps and pipes were an essential part of the vision. This created another incentive for industrial expansion, as the wastewater was free in exchange for taking it off the Port's hands, and it significantly reduced how much farm operators had to spend on fertilizers. “[We] beneficially reuse approximately 3.6 billion gallons per year of industrial wastewater generated by the food processing and other industrial facilities,” the Port wrote in a 2022 statement touting their wastewater program. In 1989, Neal took a seat on the Columbia River Enterprise Zone (CREZ), a committee that decides which areas are designated for business development incentives. Handing out tax breaks on the committee made him popular with businesspeople. Major additions to the Port during his tenure included Lamb Weston (the largest frozen potato producer in North America, with a more than $9 billion market cap) and Tillamook Creamery (a $1.2 billion operation that produces 180 million pounds of cheese annually). “I don't think many people would have the foresight like Gary,” said J.R. Cook, an agriculture industry consultant, when he spoke to the county commission about how Neal utilized his zoning authority. “It became widely known that you didn't speak out against Gary or anyone on his committees,” says Jim Doherty. “Folks out here started to call them the mafia. Those tactics became apparent in the deals to expand Amazon's data centers. Amazon initially came to the county in 2008, three years before it opened its first data center. (Amazon spokesperson Levandowski called the company's use of nondisclosure agreements “an industry-wide common practice.” Russell did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) Using strict nondisclosure agreements, Amazon required Neal, who effectively led negotiations with the tech giant, and his colleagues, to refer publicly to the Silicon Valley giant as VAData, a holding company. Jerry Healy, a Port commissioner involved in the deal, would later tell an investigator at the Oregon Ethics Commission that no one was “permitted to use the word Amazon.” (Healy did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) But it wasn't long before news of Morrow County landing business with one of the world's largest companies leaked out. And they're still making money on deals for new data centers.” By the time the first data center opened in 2011, Neal and his team were already lobbying state legislators for better tax incentive packages that would benefit Amazon. In 2015, those efforts bore fruit: The state passed Senate Bill 611, which exempted data centers from central assessment taxation. “It goes back to jobs and stability,” Neal told reporters. “The economy that he essentially created here brought him a lot of power and respect,” she tells me. But in CREZ meetings — which along with the three county commissioners included the elected leaders of the city of Boardman, plus Neal and his deputies, who'd been appointed to their roles by the elected Port commissioners — she was struck by how deferential everyone was toward Neal, and seemingly supportive of every one of his ideas and decisions. “He came across as this steward of the county,” Lindsay says. With everyone following Neal's lead, Lindsay realized that other than her and Doherty, no one was interested in wringing much out of Amazon. The deal, it seemed to Lindsay, was already done, and Amazon would give up little to secure the tax abatements. Lindsay raised her concerns with Marv Padberg, a commissioner working under Neal at the Port. According to Lindsay, Padberg urged her to avoid meddling and let Neal and his team work with Amazon behind closed doors. “Melissa, you just need to figure out the easy button,” she says Padberg told her. (Padberg did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) “I kept pointing out that we're negotiating billions of dollars,” Lindsay says. She noted that her attempts to bring in outside financial advisers or attorneys to negotiate on behalf of the committee were dismissed as unnecessary. Eventually, she was no longer included in talks about the deal with Amazon. In 2018, after 29 years as the Port director, Gary Neal stepped down. (Ryan Neal died of Covid complications in 2022 and was succeeded by Lisa Mittelsdorf.) “There are so many bad actors all at once. Each bears direct responsibility for the pollution that they're putting out there.” An experienced telecom salesperson, Lauritsen would eventually take over Windwave's operation as CEO to “try to make money with the company instead of just losing it all the time,” she says. Inland's mission was to provide much-needed fiber optic internet to remote rural hospitals and schools, which didn't pay well; Windwave was a commercial pursuit, hooking up internet to industrial clients and private businesses in eastern Oregon. But for years after Windwave was founded in 2004, the profits didn't materialize. Lauritsen answered to two distinct boards of directors that shared several members and largely functioned as one oversight body. The board members — who included Gary Neal, Don Russell, Jerry Healy, and Marv Padberg — always seemed skeptical that Windwave would survive. “Gary Neal at every board meeting told me that it'd be a zillion years before we'd become a viable company,” Lauritsen says. “They didn't expect that we would ever make it.” None of the board members had experience in commercial telecom. Instead, they'd been selected by Lauritsen's predecessor for their influence in the region's agriculture-dominated industry. He said that Neal and the other board members focused instead on “financial performance, income statements, balance sheets, cash flows, [and] to set policy.” Often, at board meetings, the public officials would evaluate the real estate tied to fiber optic projects for potential disposal of the Port's wastewater. “Right from the beginning I thought, ‘Oh, this doesn't look good,'” Lauritsen says. In 2010, Amazon signed a nearly million-dollar deal with Windwave to install and service miles of underground fiber optic lines for its first data center. Suddenly, Lauritsen noticed, the board members viewed Windwave in a new light. “When we turned the corner and were making a real profit, Don Russell said to the board, ‘Oh man, we need to look at this, there might actually be some money in the company. For Amazon, there was terrific efficiency to doing business in Morrow County. Gary Neal and his fellow public officials negotiated lucrative tax breaks for new data centers from their positions on the CREZ board, while at the same time Neal and the others oversaw Windwave's board of directors, hammering out what would become dozens of contracts as Amazon's primary fiber optic service provider. Morrow County, it seemed, had become a one-stop shop for Amazon's data centers. (Amazon spokesperson Levandowski told Rolling Stone, “We work with local officials in their official capacities as representatives of their communities and jurisdictions. Lauritsen says she wasn't aware that members of the Windwave board were negotiating tax breaks with Amazon or managing the data center wastewater as they were making deals for Windwave fiber optic. She was too busy working 60-hour weeks trying to install enough underground concrete vaults and wire conduits to keep up with the demand from the Amazon campuses. Indeed, according to Lindsay, much of Amazon's dealings with Morrow County officials were kept secret, with those officials often citing NDAs with Amazon as a pretext to move public discussions into private executive sessions. Lauritsen assumed the idea was Neal's: “No decision was ever made that Gary didn't say what he thought first and then the other ones would follow suit,” she says. Lauritsen says she was the only member of the Windwave board who objected to slicing up the company into equal portions shared by Neal, Healy, Padberg, Russell, and Blake Lawrence, another board member who'd helped Lauritsen manage construction. (Lawrence did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) She suggested instead that it should be an employee-owned operation as a reward for the loyal crew that had spent years building the fiber optic network that became the backbone of Amazon's data center enterprise. “I asked Gary why did he think that they deserved to have the company and the money it would make, and his comment back to me was, ‘They got their wages, didn't they? The tension between Lauritsen and the other board members sharpened as she declined an offer to join them as a part owner. The hostilities weren't always subtle, with Padberg at one point warning her to “be careful,” she recalls, which she took as a threat. News of their financial maneuvering did eventually come to light. There was no accountability for anyone involved until this past July, when Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield sued the men (and three “disinterested directors” recruited by the owners to approve the sale from the Inland board) in circuit court, alleging that these “established community leaders” had “abused their authority and breached the public trust for their personal financial gain.” In a press release announcing the lawsuit, Rayfield said “this nonprofit was created to connect eastern Oregon communities — not to quietly enrich a handful of officials behind closed doors.” Their first step was to arrange for a sale price that was well under the actual value of the company. To do that, “the Insiders” — which is how Rayfield described Neal, Healy, Padberg, and Russell — had to get around the Cogence Group, a financial forensics and business valuation firm, which was brought in to conduct a valuation of Windwave. And they've been getting away with this for decades now.” According to Rayfield, the men did this by withholding important financial information about Windwave, namely the lucrative deals they were negotiating with Amazon Web Services. Without that information, Cogence put Windwave's fair market value at $1.8 million. The board members purchased Windwave at that price two months later. But that figure was still far below the firm's actual value. The AG estimated that at the time Windwave was worth “at least $9.5 million.” All told, they'd reaped $6.9 million in savings by keeping information from Cogence. But these insiders did more than just hide the company's value, according to Rayfield. They also ignored the advice of Inland's attorneys to seek what's called a “fairness opinion” before the purchase, to ensure an organization is treated fairly by its directors. What's more, those loans, according to the AG, had “sub-market interest rates [that] required a one-time balloon payment of the loan's balance after five years.” Inland hired Windwave to continue “its charitable mission of serving rural Oregonians” with fiber optic connections for “schools, libraries, hospitals, courts, law enforcement, and veteran's services.” Only now Inland would have to pay Windwave $200,000 a year over the next five years, ensuring another million-dollar stream of revenue beyond the Amazon data centers. (Windwave later almost doubled the fees it charged its former parent company, earning $350,000 from Inland in 2019, according to the nonprofit's IRS filings.) The sequence of events is complex, but worth summarizing for its audacity. Gary Neal and his partners wrested control of Windwave from its nonprofit parent and sold it to themselves, hiding insider knowledge of lucrative deals with Amazon to keep the price low. News of the lawsuit ripped through Morrow County in July. Many residents were outraged, and relieved that powerful public officials were finally being held to account for at least some of their misdeeds, even if it wasn't for the water pollution. On local Facebook groups, commenters expressed disgust at “the cloud of corruption and exploitation behind it all,” as one person wrote. “They were sitting on boards and commissions meant to represent the public while secretly enriching themselves — using insider knowledge of Amazon's data center expansion that was never shared with the public.” Another person wrote, “Justice rides a slow horse, but it does eventually arrive.” Rayfield has not ruled out the possibility of pressing criminal charges, including fraud, if the evidence he uncovers during discovery can be pursued under existing statutes of limitations. “It created an economic incentive to be in the area. When reports of the Windwave deal reached Melissa Lindsay, her confusion over Neal's softball negotiating tactics with Amazon disappeared. They knew from the get-go how big Amazon would become in Morrow County,” she says. MELISSA LINDSAY AND JIM DOHERTY would pay a stiff price for speaking out publicly against Neal and the Windwave owners in their dealings with Amazon. In October 2022, a month after The Oregonian investigation was published, several of Neal's longtime political allies launched a recall campaign against both commissioners. (Spicer did not respond to repeated requests for comment.) “I don't have a problem with the Hispanic citizens being treated appropriately,” she told Oregon Public Broadcasting. “But [Doherty is] not following through and solving the problem for them.” The campaign corresponded with decreased sales for Doherty's cattle business. Lindsay says, “It was horrible for myself and my family. Doherty and Lindsay weren't the only ones facing consequences for their actions. With the two commissioners out of office, the advocacy group Oregon Rural Action stepped up its efforts to lobby Oregon lawmakers and Brown's successor, Gov. In November 2023, they hosted a group of state representatives for a tour of homes where wells had nitrate levels as high as 45 ppm. During the tour, Kaleb Lay, ORA's research and policy director, said one of his colleagues got a call that his truck was on fire. Flyers explaining how residents could receive free nitrate tests had been removed from the truck and ripped up, lying in pieces on the street just a few feet away. He attributed both errors “to one of the firefighters who didn't have any fire investigation skills,” adding, “We've since changed our protocol.” Ultimately, the department ruled the fire an accident and closed its investigation. She'd prepared a plate of cookies she baked that morning, set atop the red tablecloth of her dining room table. “When Jim declared the emergency, I told him I'd been sick for the last three years, and he came out the next day and got my water tested and it was 50.9 ppm. “If it wasn't for these people here,” she added, referring to ORA, “and Jim Doherty exposing it all, I don't know that we would ever have been told.” Mendoza relies on a biweekly water delivery of five five-gallon jugs for cooking all her meals and to drink. Every eight weeks she goes for an infusion of drugs that calms her inflamed immune system. “How can you live with yourself knowing that the water you put in people's houses is causing miscarriages or cancer, or God only knows how it stunts the growth of a kid? Then these people go out and show their faces in public. And they're still making money with it, every time those deals get cut for new data centers.” “There are so many bad actors all at once,” says Lay. “Each of these polluters bears direct responsibility for the pollution that they're putting out there and they should be held responsible. Every one of these agencies, from the DEQ to the Oregon Department of Agriculture, they all have regulatory authority and they haven't used it.” IN APRIL 2024, THE DEQ hit the Port of Morrow with a $727,000 fine for 880 permit violations incurred for spraying excess contaminated water over winter fields between November 2023 and February 2024. But the Port carried on with its winter application until its announcement this fall that it would suspend the practice. “There is no alternative short of closing processing plants,” Port director Lisa Mittelsdorf told a reporter last January. “We must balance protecting thousands of jobs in the region, the national food supply, and domestic well users during this short period of time,” Gov. The Port is now waiting for approval of a $432 million federal grant that could allow the construction of additional wastewater storage as well as new facilities to eventually reduce wastewater nitrate levels. In 2024, before the AG suit, investigators from the Oregon Ethics Commission recommended that Neal, Padberg, Healy, and Russell be penalized for failing to disclose their conflicts of interest while negotiating Amazon transactions on behalf of the public. This meant that all but a few months of Neal's tenure at Windwave and the Port fell outside the ethics panel's inquiry. Still, staff investigators stated that they found an October 2018 meeting discussing Amazon's tax break deal that appeared to warrant Neal being sanctioned. It was during that meeting where “Neal may have engaged in a prohibited use of position and may have failed to disclose his conflicts of interest,” the commission investigators found in their preliminary review. Amazon and the new owners of Windwave were able to continue operating as before. That could all change, however, because of an attorney in Seattle named Steve Berman. A class action specialist, Berman rose to prominence in the 1990s during the landmark big tobacco lawsuits by winning the largest single settlement of those suits ($260 billion) on behalf of a consortium of states, and more recently as the lead attorney on behalf of NCAA athletes who can now make money off their own names and likeness competing in college sports. In February 2024, representing a group of six Morrow County residents, Berman filed a federal suit against the Port of Morrow, Lamb Weston, and three other large agriculture operators for their role in causing and perpetuating the region's water crisis. Berman tells me that on Dec. 1 he will add Tillamook and Portland General Electric, a local utility, to the list of defendants. (A representative for PGE confirmed the utility received “a notice of intent to sue” and added that the water used “at its Coyote Springs plant [is] for non-contact cooling operations and does not add nitrates to the water supplied by the Port of Morrow.”) Crucially, Berman's suit also lists unnamed John Doe defendants, which several sources close to the case believe to be a placeholder for Berman's biggest target: Amazon. On March 7, 2024, Berman and his local co-counsel, Michael Bliven, sent what's known as an RCRA Notice, a reference to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, to Amazon. Such notices warn of a pending civil lawsuit and offer potential defendants the opportunity to remediate harm within a given timeframe. “It's considered a basic civic right in the U.S. that the water you drink from your wells or that you get from your town should be clean and not contaminated,” Berman says. Should Berman include Amazon, it would seem to be in the company's best interest to hammer out a pretrial settlement, if only as a strategy to contain the public relations blowback that would result from a lengthy, high-profile class action trial. Weeks of media coverage unpacking the data center public health threat would complicate matters for Amazon as it continues its aggressive rollout of new data centers in rural farming communities across the country. Amazon's connections to Windwave only make the situation more acute: Their representatives engaged in negotiations with public officials in violation of state ethics rules while at the same time paying millions of dollars to a company whose officials are now being sued by the state attorney general. A week before the Oregon attorney general filed the Windwave complaint, I heard from sources in Boardman who are close to Berman's case. They had been told that Berman's office was in advanced talks with Amazon to settle for $100 million before a trial begins. Berman demurred on the record, saying that he could not comment on any negotiations or discussions with current or past defendants while the case was still pending. Amazon did not respond directly to questions about a pending settlement. “The people whose rights are being violated don't have a lot of power, and the people responsible for the pollution are huge mega corporations with a lot of power,” Berman says. “And they've been getting away with this for decades now.” Situated on 40 acres along a long, quiet blacktop road, Jim Doherty's ranch home, where he lives with his wife, Kelly, has windows looking out to the pasture where their cattle graze. The Dohertys are in close proximity to dozens of properties with tainted wells. When I visited in November 2024, it had been more than a year since the Dohertys' water had tested “hot,” as Jim described the contamination. Still, Kelly periodically dunks a rapid-test strip in her morning coffee just to be safe. “There's 14 people that live on my road,” Kelly says. “I think nine of them have cancer right now.” The Dohertys' son, Bryce, lives a few miles away. He and his wife bought their land in 2018, built a new house, and drilled a well that hadn't tested positive for nitrate contamination at the time they moved in. But two years after moving in, they suffered a miscarriage. When that happened, Kelly says, she told Bryce to have their water checked. “And he's like, ‘Mom, we just built the place, it's all undetectable,'” she recalls. It came back 27 ppm, nearly four times the Oregon limit. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Los Angeles judge said today she's on the brink of ordering the sale of Nicki Minaj's $20 million Hidden Hills mansion so a security guard can collect on the $500,000 default judgment he won after suing the “Barbie World” rapper and her husband over his alleged backstage assault at a concert in Germany. “My tentative is to grant this,” Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Cindy Pánuco said at an afternoon hearing. “Let's say there's no bidder who offers the full $20 million, and it goes up for auction, and they don't get fair market value, and it doesn't cover everything,” Pánuco gave as a hypothetical. And if it didn't, they could deal with that possibility at a later date, he said. “As I understand it, that's the only piece missing. She set a follow-up hearing for Jan. 22 to receive the pending paperwork and enter her ruling. Plaintiff Thomas Weidenmuller filed his application for the order last month, telling the court he tried to enforce the default judgment through less extreme measures, but Minaj and her husband, Kenneth Petty, have not responded. He says seven “potential garnishees” claimed they did “not have any accounts payable to Minaj or otherwise failed to respond at all.” With the home recently appraised at $20 million, a sale would yield approximately $6 million in funds once the lien and exception are paid, it estimated. The application described Minaj as a global music superstar with an estimated net worth of at least $150 million. “There is little doubt that she is highly capable of paying the judgment in full, and yet, she has refused to do so despite multiple written requests for payment and levies served upon several of her suspected creditors,” the filing said. According to Weidenmuller, Minaj became visibly frustrated and blamed the female guard for allowing a fan to breach a barricade and climb onstage with her. Weidenmuller says he stepped in and told Minaj it wasn't fair that the guard's career might be “ruined” on social media. In response, Minaj allegedly threw a shoe at Weidenmuller but missed.
