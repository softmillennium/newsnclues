                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo's recent comments regarding his disregard for the importance of winning a FIFA World Cup as it pertains to his own soccer legacy have not gone down well with one former U.S. Men's National Team star turned pundit. In a wide-ranging recent interview with Piers Morgan, 40-year-old Ronaldo, who is currently the highest-paid athlete in the world with Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr, said, “If you ask me, ‘Cristiano, is it a dream to win the World Cup?' To win a World Cup is not going to change my name in the history of football. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner went on to explain that, in his eyes, winning the World Cup won't alter his standing in the pantheon of soccer greatness, adding, “To define what? To define if I'm one of the best in history, to win one competition, [of] six games, seven games. Ronaldo, who is perhaps best known for his stints with Real Madrid and Manchester United, did concede the importance of winning a World Cup would represent for his home nation. “How many World Cups win Argentina before [Lionel] Messi? Yeah, maybe two, I think,” he said. These countries, they are used to win big competitions. “Of course, you want to win, yeah. Ronaldo's comments didn't sit well with Taylor Twellman, however, who was quick to label the five-time World Cup participant “a fraud” on the 'It's Called Soccer' podcast. He went on to claim that Ronaldo had been proclaiming how winning the tournament was his dream prior to Argentina's win at the most recent competition in 2022, adding, “Now that Messi's won it and he can't, now it's not a dream. Asked why Ronaldo would make such a comment, especially given how strong Portugal appears to be heading into the 2026 tournament, Twellman commented, “Anything about Cristiano is about Cristiano. But, for me, (head coach) Roberto Martinez must be like, ‘Really, dude that's what you're saying now? Ronaldo may not be putting too much pressure on himself when it comes to winning the 2026 World Cup in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, despite having admitted that this will be his final attempt, but thanks to a generous FIFA ruling, he will be able to participate from day one. Recently sent off for the first time in his international career, during a 2-0 loss to the Republic of Ireland in their second-to-last qualifier, FIFA slapped Ronaldo with a three-game ban, which he began by missing their dominant 9-1 group finale win over Armenia, which secured their spot at the upcoming tournament. However, while a three-game ban would have seen him miss the first two group stage games at the World Cup, FIFA announced on Tuesday, just days after he met with President Donald Trump at the White House, that the remainder of his suspension “has been suspended,” with some suggesting this is down to his otherwise clean disciplinary record. “The FIFA Disciplinary Committee has imposed a three-match ban on Cristiano Ronaldo following his direct red card at the FIFA World Cup 2026 preliminary competition match between the Republic of Ireland and Portugal played in Dublin on 13 November 2025. “In line with article 27 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code, the serving of the two remaining matches has been suspended under a one-year probation period. “This is without prejudice to any additional sanctions imposed for the new infringement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cristiano Ronaldo will be eligible to play in Portugal's opening match of the 2026 World Cup, assuming he makes the squad. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner was sent off in a 2-0 loss to the Republic of Ireland on Nov. 13, which forced him to miss a 9-1 win over Armenia that sealed Portugal's qualification. FIFA ruled the remainder of Ronaldo's three-match ban is suspended for a year, which clears his availability for the World Cup. At 40 years old, Ronaldo is clearly no longer at his peak on the pitch, and playing in the Saudi Pro League means he's not being challenged in the same way he would at a top club in Europe. Ronaldo scored five goals in five World Cup qualifying fixtures and had eight goals and one assist across nine matches in the Nations League last season. One could question whether it's time for coach Roberto Martínez to pivot toward a younger forward line and a less heliocentric plan of attack. A longstanding criticism of Ronaldo in recent years is that he's offering less and less beyond his goalscoring,  and his massive profile makes it almost impossible to use him in a supporting role or as a super sub off the bench. But de-emphasizing the Al-Nassr star would represent a major tactical change. He continues to be a regular starter for Portugal and play deep into matches. For better or worse, Ronaldo will have a big say in how far the country advances in the 2026 World Cup.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA announced Tuesday the four pots that will be used to make the draw for the 2026 World Cup. The 48 countries will be drawn into 12 groups of four, and the groups will have one team from each pot. The draw will unfold Dec. 5 in Washington, D.C., but the full World Cup field won't be finalized until mid-March. Four spots are still up for grabs within the UEFA confederation. These are the four matchups to be decided on March 31: The remaining confederations are competing in their own play-off: In terms of the pots, Italy will be the one country everybody wants to avoid if the four-time champion qualifies. Getting Norway out of Pot 3 could be just as perilous. Erling Haaland is the best striker in the world, and the 4-1 demolition of Italy on Nov. 16 showed this is more than just a one-man team. Now, the eight best third-place finishers will get to move on as well.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Tuesday, FIFA finalized seeding and procedures for the 2026 World Cup draw, including two new wrinkles with implications for the title favorites and co-hosts. The U.S., for example, will open against a Pot 3 team, then play its second game against a Pot 2 team, and its group finale against a Pot 4 team. All four pots will be seeded based on the FIFA rankings, with the six to-be-determined playoff winners — four from Europe, two from an inter-confederation playoff in March — all sent to Pot 4. As usual, no two teams from the same confederation can share a group, with the exception of Europe, which will place one team in each group and a second team in four of the 12 groups. Italy, ranked 12th in the world, would have been a Pot 2 team if it had qualified directly; instead, if Italy wins its playoff, it will essentially be seeded alongside 82nd-ranked Curaçao and 84th-ranked Haiti. The draw will begin at noon ET (5pm GMT; 9am ET) next Friday, December 5, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Over the 24 hours or so after the draw concludes, FIFA will then determine and release the World Cup schedule, with each match assigned to a specific stadium and kickoff time. This was FIFA's relatively simple mechanism to separate countries from the same region — or, in Europe's case, ensure that no more than two could be in the same group. By now, that seeding concept is ingrained and assumed. Ahead of 2026, the question was how to deal with six World Cup spots that remain unfilled. FIFA officials, therefore, had multiple options: Should they place all six playoff teams in Pot 4? That decision, though, could make some groups significantly more difficult than others. At previous World Cups, in addition to randomly drawing teams into groups, FIFA would randomly select a team's position within its group. Pot 1 teams always occupied Position 1, but when, say, Croatia is drawn from Pot 2, it could go into Position 2, 3 or 4 — which would, in turn, determine the sequence of its group games. For the 2026 World Cup, instead, those positions have been pre-determined — in part to speed up the draw, in part to ensure a balanced distribution of matches throughout the group stage, a FIFA official said on a Zoom with reporters Tuesday. This means that the U.S. men's national team now knows it will conclude group play against a Pot 4 team — potentially the weakest opponent in its group — on Thursday, June 25, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. Mexico's national team will play its games in the same order: At previous World Cups, there were no restrictions on knockout matchups. In 2026, that won't happen — unless the favorites slip up and finish second or third in their respective groups. FIFA's draw procedure will ensure that Spain and Argentina, the top two seeds, get placed in groups whose winners will go to opposite sides of the knockout bracket. This means that England and France, should they win their groups, also could not meet until the final, and neither could meet Spain or Argentina until the semifinals. These restrictions could confuse viewers, but will reward teams who've been dominant in World Cup qualifying and other recent tournaments — if they remain dominant through the World Cup group stage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cristiano Ronaldo is set to receive only a one-match ban for his red card against the Republic of Ireland in Portugal's penultimate World Cup qualifier. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner was sent off after elbowing Dara O'Shea off the ball and was set for a three-match ban for 'violent conduct'. However, FIFA's disciplinary committee has decided to let the 40-year-old off easy. Ronaldo was expected to miss one or two of Portugal's opening clashes in the 2026 World Cup in North America after being shown a red card for violent conduct on O'Shea. However, FIFA's disciplinary committee have ruled that the Portugal captain's actions were only worth a one-game ban, which he has already served after he missed Roberto Martinez's squad for the 9-1 win over Armenia. His punishment, however, also holds a two-game suspended ban, which will be triggered if he is found guilty of a similar offence yet again in the next 365 days. Ronaldo was sent off just before the hour mark, after Swedish referee Glenn Nyberg consulted with VAR, having shown the five-time Ballon d'Or winner a yellow card initially. In the review, it seemed clear to the referee that, in a tussle with O'Shea, Ronaldo clearly elbowed O'Shea in the back without any ball involvement around him. It has been reported that this disciplinary record may have played a massive part in the FIFA disciplinary committee's decision.

Ronaldo's absence for Portugal's 9-1 win over Armenia raised serious questions from fans over the five-time Ballon d'Or winner's spot in Martinez's World Cup squad as Portugal's attacking play seemed a lot smoother. Despite all the questions regarding Ronaldo's form at the highest level, it is highly unlikely that Martinez will be altering his squad this close to the World Cup. As such, it is almost guaranteed that Ronaldo will be the first name on the teamsheet when Portugal kickoff their 2026 World Cup campaign in North America. However, the ill-tempered Ronaldo will have to keep his emotions in check through the tournament, as another sending off or even a violation of FIFA's regulations could see him miss the latter stages of the World Cup.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Italy are expected to host Northern Ireland in Bergamo for the World Cup play-off semifinal in March 2026, as Atalanta's New Balance Arena has its stands close to the pitch and already provided a warm welcome on Gennaro Gattuso's debut in September. FIGC President Gabriele Gravina confirmed last week that Italy will likely host the World Cup play-off semifinal against Northern Ireland at the New Balance Arena in Bergamo, home to Serie A side Atalanta. The Azzurri will play on March 26, 2026, and if they progress to the Final, they'll visit Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina on March 31. As reported by Repubblica, Gattuso and the federation were delighted by the welcome received in Bergamo on September 5, when the coach made his debut as La Nazionale's boss, beating Estonia 5-0. According to Repubblica, if Italy had played the Final at home, Udine, Rome and Turin (Allianz Stadium) would have been the favourites to host the two Italy games, but with just one play-off tie played domestically, the Bergamo option was predominant and is expected to be confirmed in the coming days.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FUKUSHIMA, Japan (November 25, 2025) – The U.S. Women's Deaf National Team used a brace from Emily Spreeman as well as goals from Holly Hunter and Erin Cembrale to earn a 4-0 win against hosts Japan in the Final of the Women's Football Competition at the 2025 Deaflympics. The match was the last in the illustrious international careers of Spreeman and fellow veterans Sydney Andrews and Kate Ward, as well as the final game managed by head coach Amy Griffin and assistant Joy Fawcett as the Deaf WNT claimed a record fifth Deaflympics gold medal and eighth overall world championship title since beginning play in 2005. The U.S. took a few minutes to settle into the match, but eventually came out blazing with four chances in as many minutes. A minute later, Paris Price's cross from the left found Tia LaBrecque whose first-time effort clanged off the bar. In the 12th minute, Mia White was slotted through on goal, but her powerful shot from the right was turned away by Kunishima. After a frustrating period of chances and a few good Japan attacks, the U.S. finally broke through on the half-hour mark. Spreeman fed White in down the right, where she hopped a defender before getting to the endline and crossing to Hunter at the near post. A second nearly came in first-half stoppage time as Ani Khachadourian broke down the right and crossed looking for Cembrale in the box, but Japan's Kanon Masuda was there to clear the danger and keep the U.S. lead to one goal at halftime. The USA striker sped forward before slotting home the 49th goal of her international career to make it 2-0. Sitting one away from 50 goals in her final international match, Spreeman wasn't quite ready to hang up her scoring boots. The ball was cleared out of the box, but collected by Cembrale who looped a beautiful effort into the top left corner to make it 4-0.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Milan had reportedly offered an extension until 2028, increasing his salary from €2.8 million to €5.5m per year, but he has not been convinced to sign on the dotted line with Calciomercato reporting that no further talks are scheduled between the goalkeeper and club. Juventus have emerged as serious contenders for his signature, hoping to capitalise on the uncertainty and secure one of Europe's top goalkeepers without a transfer fee. Premier League clubs have also shown strong interest in Maignan, who has been a key player at Milan since he joined from Lille in 2021, with Chelsea emerging as the most serious contender. In fact, they were close to finalising a deal this summer before Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri intervened to block the transfer, partly influenced by the club's ongoing efforts to sign Strasbourg right-back Guela Doue. Chelsea's chances may now improve, especially as Juventus' renewed interest in the 30-year-old comes at a difficult moment for the Italian side. UEFA has opened fresh proceedings into alleged financial irregularities between 2022 and 2025, raising the risk of further sanctions. This could weaken Juventus' ability to compete financially for a top signing. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. His shot-stopping, leadership and calm presence quickly made him one of the league's standout goalkeepers. However, the following two seasons were disrupted by injuries that affected his consistency and availability, leading to concerns within the club about his long-term reliability. Despite those setbacks, Maignan has returned strongly in the current campaign. His resurgence has re-established him as a key figure for Milan while also attracting interest from major European clubs. Milan have reignited their Serie A title hopes under Allegri, highlighted by Sunday's derby win over Inter thanks to a goal from Christian Pulisic. With no European commitments this season, Milan are serious title contenders, and the allure of silverware could be used to persuade Maignan to extend his contract. Juventus remain interested, viewing Maignan's European experience as a valuable asset to rotate with Michele De Gregorio. Enzo Maresca could push for the move, seeing Maignan as a potential final piece to strengthen Chelsea's title ambitions. Maignan's decision will be pivotal for Milan, with clubs across Europe keen to secure one of the continent's top goalkeepers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gotham FC celebrated their second NWSL Championship victory with a celebratory parade in New York City, USA, on Monday (24 November). “To win a championship, it literally takes every last person,” said Final MVP Lavelle at the ceremony. “I think the commitment that this club and everybody within it has taken just to get one per cent better every single day is the reason why we're up here right now getting to celebrate this.” This is the third time that the North American elite women's football championship title has returned to New York City, following the team's maiden NWSL triumph in 2023 against OL Reign (now known as Seattle Reign FC). Their first top level title came in 2009, when the team was known as Sky Blue FC and the competition was Women's Professional Soccer (WPS). New York also marked Gotham FC's triumph by lighting up the Empire State Building in the team's black-and-blue colours on Monday night. Led by two-time NWSL champion coach Juan Carlos Amorós, Gotham FC have a host of talent among their ranks. Lavelle is one of four USA Olympic gold medallists, alongside Jaedyn Shaw, Emily Sonnett, and Tierna Davidson. The U.S. players were given a special welcome to their national team camp the same day, as Emma Hayes' USA host Italy in a double header in Florida on Friday (28 November) and next Monday (1 December). The newly crowned U.S. league winners also feature Paris 2024 bronze medallist Ann-Katrin Berger of Germany, FIFA World Cup winner with Spain Esther González, and England's two-time European champion Jess Carter.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The talent Chelsea possess in their first team squad means that they are going to be seeing a large number of their players in action at the 2026 World Cup. After Enzo Maresca led his side to Club World Cup glory last summer, there will be some Chelsea players going up against each other this time around, with elimination potentially on the line. Cole Palmer and Moises Caicedo could meet in the group stages after it was determined that Ecuador would be in Pot Two for the World Cup. He was named in the Netherlands squad in the most recent international break, ahead of Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee. Dutch media praised Emegha for his performance on debut, however he missed a number of big chances in his second showing. Injuries have disrupted his start to the 2025/26 campaign. He has only managed six Ligue 1 appearances, scoring four goals in that time. Fans of the French side are not keen on him for jumping ship to the BlueCo partner club, but while he has the backing of Liam Rosenior he is set to continue earning minutes until he departs.
