Maternal thyroid hormones are essential for fetal neurodevelopment. Gestational thyroid imbalance has been associated with atypical neurodevelopment, including increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that affects how a person communicates, interacts with others and experiences the world. We found that while adequately treated chronic thyroid dysfunction was not associated with increased autism risk in offspring, ongoing imbalance across multiple trimesters was. These findings underscore the need for routine monitoring and timely adjustment of therapy to maintain normal thyroid hormone levels throughout pregnancy." Idan Menashe, Ph.D., Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beer Sheva, Israel The study followed more than 51,000 births and found that mothers with persistent thyroid hormone imbalance across pregnancy were at an increased risk of having children with autism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Electroconvulsive therapy is a safe and effective treatment for elderly patients suffering from depression. This treatment often produces better results than in younger patients and could reduce the need for hospital care, according to new research from örebro University.Tor Arnison, a licensed psychologist and researcher in clinical epidemiology at örebro University, has conducted a registry study of more than 500 people aged 85 or older who have received electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). We wanted to study people aged 85 years or older because they often have depression but are rarely included in research. Medications are known to cause more side effects in this age group. At the same time, knowledge is lacking about how effective and safe other forms of treatment, such as ECT, are for these patients." Tor Arnison, licensed psychologist and researcher in clinical epidemiology, örebro University The results show that ECT is highly effective in treating elderly patients. Approximately eight out of ten patients showed improvement, and over half made a full recovery. "They also had fewer hospital admissions after treatment than their peers who did not receive ECT. Side effects were relatively few and mainly consisted of temporary confusion or blood pressure effects," says Tor Arnison.He concludes that ECT is a safe and effective treatment even among the oldest patients - and that it often works better in this group than in younger patients. "Advanced age in itself does not appear to be an inhibitor to ECT, and severe mental illness can be treated successfully even in very old age." "The results show that ECT should be used more in this age group, especially when medication does not help or causes severe side effects. The study may help to reduce hesitation in healthcare and increase access to effective treatment for the oldest patients," says Tor Arnison.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New computer modeling could help scientists better understand how the retina regenerates, opening the door to new treatments for vision loss, according to a study from the University of Surrey. The model shows how simple genetic rules and subtle randomness work together to form the retina's precise layered architecture, a structure essential for how we see. Cayla Harris, lead researcher from the University of Surrey's Nature Inspired Computing and Engineering Group, said: "The beauty of biology is that complex structures can emerge from simple rules. Our simulations show how genetically identical cells can, through intrinsic bias and chance, self-organize into the retina's highly ordered layers - a pattern that underpins how we see the world." Using the BioDynaMo software platform, the team modelled virtual "cells" that grow, divide and make fate decisions based on internal gene-regulation logic, mimicking biological behavior. They tested different network designs for how genes might interact when cells decide what kind of neuron to become. Two particular designs - called the Reentry and Multidirectional models - reproduced real biological data most accurately, suggesting that retinal cells may make their fate decisions through overlapping and flexible genetic pathways, rather than a fixed sequence. This approach could help researchers better understand not only healthy eye development but also what happens in retinal diseases and in regenerative research exploring how stem cells might rebuild tissue. Computational modeling gives us a powerful way to explore biological processes we can't easily observe in real time. By simulating every cell's decision and interaction, we can test hypotheses about how tissues like the retina form - and how to restore them when damaged."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have uncovered a surprising mechanism by which a brain enzyme called OTULIN controls the expression of tau, the protein that forms toxic tangles in Alzheimer's disease. The findings, published today in Genomic Psychiatry, reveal that OTULIN functions not only as expected in protein degradation pathways but also plays a previously unknown role as a master regulator of gene expression and RNA metabolism. Their unexpected findings could open new therapeutic avenues for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias affecting millions worldwide. We set out to test whether stabilizing a specific type of ubiquitin chain would help clear toxic tau from neurons. Instead, we discovered something completely unexpected – that OTULIN acts as a master switch controlling whether tau is even produced in the first place." The research team initially hypothesized that inhibiting OTULIN's enzyme activity would enhance tau clearance through cellular garbage disposal systems. However, when they completely knocked out the OTULIN gene in neurons, tau disappeared entirely – not because it was being degraded faster, but because it wasn't being made at all. "We found that OTULIN deficiency causes tau mRNA to vanish, along with massive changes in how the cell processes RNA and controls gene expression." The study used neurons derived from a patient with late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease, which showed elevated levels of both OTULIN protein and phosphorylated tau compared to healthy control neurons. First, when OTULIN was completely removed from neuroblastoma cells, comprehensive RNA sequencing showed dramatic changes in gene expression – 13,341 genes were downregulated and 774 were upregulated, with even more dramatic effects on RNA transcripts (43,003 downregulated, 1,113 upregulated). Comparing Alzheimer's patient neurons to healthy controls revealed over 4,500 genes and 5,600 transcripts were differentially expressed. Second, pharmacological inhibition of OTULIN's enzymatic activity with a novel small molecule inhibitor (UC495) reduced phosphorylated tau levels in Alzheimer's disease neurons, suggesting potential therapeutic benefit without complete gene elimination. Third, the absence of OTULIN upregulated numerous genes associated with RNA degradation and stability regulation, including components of the CCR4-NOT complex and various RNA-binding proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. These findings have profound implications for treating tauopathies, a group of more than 20 neurodegenerative diseases characterized by toxic tau accumulation. "OTULIN could serve as a novel drug target, but our findings suggest we need to modulate its activity carefully rather than eliminate it completely," Dr. Bhaskar noted. "Complete loss causes widespread changes in cellular RNA metabolism that could have unintended consequences." This suggests a therapeutic window exists where OTULIN activity could be tuned to beneficial levels. The team also discovered that OTULIN deficiency prevents the development of autoinflammation in neurons by downregulating inflammatory pathway components, providing additional insight into how cells balance protein quality control with inflammatory responses. Beyond Alzheimer's disease, the findings illuminate fundamental mechanisms of RNA metabolism regulation in neurons. "We're essentially looking at a previously unknown checkpoint in gene expression," explained Dr. Liao. "OTULIN appears to influence which genes get expressed and how long their RNA messages survive in cells." The team used cutting-edge techniques including CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from Alzheimer's patients and healthy controls, comprehensive bulk RNA sequencing, and computational drug design to identify the OTULIN inhibitor UC495. They're also testing whether carefully calibrated OTULIN inhibition can reduce tau pathology in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. "We need to determine whether targeting OTULIN therapeutically can safely reduce tau accumulation without disrupting essential cellular functions." The team is also investigating why OTULIN long noncoding RNA is reduced in Alzheimer's neurons and whether restoring its levels could normalize OTULIN protein expression and tau pathology. The comprehensive RNA sequencing data have been deposited in publicly accessible databases to enable further research by scientists worldwide. The findings represent years of meticulous work combining molecular biology, cell biology, genomics, and computational approaches to unravel the complex relationship between protein quality control systems and neurodegenerative disease. Tau pathology correlates more closely with cognitive decline than amyloid accumulation, making it a critical therapeutic target. Tauopathies encompass more than 20 brain diseases where tau forms toxic aggregates, including frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Current treatments provide only modest symptomatic relief without addressing underlying disease mechanisms. The discovery that OTULIN regulates tau at the gene expression level, rather than simply controlling its degradation, represents a fundamental advance in understanding how tau pathology develops and suggests novel intervention strategies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new JNeurosci paper, Tian-Ming Gao and colleagues, from Southern Medical University, explored how adenosine triphosphate (ATP) signaling relates to depression and anxiety using male mice. ATP is a molecule that not only provides energy but also supports communication between neurons. Male mice that were more likely to acquire depressive- and anxiety-like symptoms following long-term stress had less ATP levels and reduced expression of a protein involved in ATP release (connexin 43). When the research team genetically dampened or deleted connexin 43 in cells that release ATP in another group of mice, this alone led to depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors and lowered ATP levels. Bridging the findings together, in distressed mice, restoring connexin 43 in the hippocampus brought ATP levels up to normal and improved behavioral outcomes. This is the first direct evidence that deficient ATP release in [a region of the] hippocampus drives both depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, revealing a shared molecular pathway [for these conditions]." Gao also emphasizes that the findings linking connexin 43 to this mechanism point to a potential treatment target for treating depression and anxiety when they occur at the same time. Of note, the researchers plan to assess both sexes in future studies. ATP release deficiency through astrocytic connexin 43 in the dorsal hippocampus promotes depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study led by Cambridge's MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit compared the brains of 3,802 people between zero and ninety years old using datasets of MRI diffusion scans, which map neural connections by tracking how water molecules move through brain tissue. In a study published in Nature Communications, scientists say they detected five broad phases of brain structure in the average human life, split up by four pivotal "turning points" between birth and death when our brains reconfigure. Childhood brain "topology" runs from birth until a turning point at the age of nine, when it transitions to the adolescent phase – an era that lasts right up to the age of 32, on average. Our early thirties see the brain's neural wiring shift into adult mode. This is the longest era, which lasts over three decades. Finally, the "late aging" brain takes shape at around 83 years old. "We know the brain's wiring is crucial to our development, but we lack a big picture of how it changes across our lives and why," said Dr. Alexa Mousley, a Gates Cambridge Scholar who led the research. "This study is the first to identify major phases of brain wiring across a human lifespan." "These eras provide important context for what our brains might be best at, or more vulnerable to, at different stages of our lives. From infancy through childhood, our brains are defined by "network consolidation", as the wealth of synapses – the connectors between neurons – overproduced in a baby's brain are whittled down, with the more active ones surviving. Meanwhile, grey and white matter grow rapidly in volume, so that cortical thickness – the distance between outer grey matter and inner white matter – reaches a peak, and cortical folding, the characteristic ridges on the outer brain, stabilises. By the first turning point at nine years old, the brain is experiencing a step-change in cognitive capacity, as well as an increased risk of mental health disorders. This era is defined by the efficiency of connections both within specific regions as well as rapid communication right across the whole brain, which is related to enhanced cognitive performance. While puberty offers a clear start, the end of adolescence is much harder to pin down scientifically. Based purely on neural architecture, we found that adolescent-like changes in brain structure end around the early thirties." At age 32, the longest era, that of adulthood, begins. Brain architecture stabilises compared to previous phases – with no major turning points for thirty years. This corresponds with a "plateau in intelligence and personality" based on other studies, say researchers. They also found "segregation" is more noticeable during this epoch, as regions slowly start to become more compartmentalised. The turning point at age 66 is far milder, and not defined by any major structural shifts, although researchers still found meaningful changes to the pattern of brain networks on average at around this age. "This is an age when people face increased risk for a variety of health conditions that can affect the brain, such as hypertension." While data is limited for this era, the defining feature is a shift from global to local, as whole brain connectivity declines even further, with increased reliance on certain regions. "Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras," added senior author Prof Duncan Astle, Professor of Neuroinformatics at Cambridge. Indeed, differences in brain wiring predict difficulties with attention, language, memory, and a whole host of different behaviours" "Understanding that the brain's structural journey is not a question of steady progression, but rather one of a few major turning points, will help us identify when and how its wiring is vulnerable to disruption."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is the first time researchers have demonstrated a potential survival benefit from using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier to improve delivery of chemotherapy to the tumor site in brain cancer patients after surgery. Using focused ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier and deliver chemotherapy could significantly increase patient survival, which other ongoing studies are seeking to confirm and expand." Graeme Woodworth, MD, study principal investigator, Professor and Chair of Neurosurgery at UMSOM and Neurosurgeon-In-Chief at the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) The findings of this groundbreaking safety, feasibility, and comparative trial involved glioblastoma patients who were given focused ultrasound to open their blood-brain barrier before getting chemotherapy; they were matched to a rigorously selected control group of 185 glioblastoma patients with similar characteristics who received the standard dose of the chemotherapy drug, temozolomide, without receiving focused ultrasound. Trial participants were initially treated with surgery to remove their brain tumor, followed by six weeks of chemotherapy and radiation, and up to six monthly focused-ultrasound treatments plus temozolomide. Results were published in the journal Lancet Oncology and show that trial participants had nearly 14 months of median progression-free survival, compared to eight months in the control group. In terms of overall survival, trial participants, on average, lived for more than 30 months compared to 19 months in the control group. The study builds on more than a decade of intensive research to test the safety and feasibility of opening the blood-brain barrier using focused ultrasound first in animal studies and then in patients. "We also demonstrated that this could be a useful technique that enables us to better monitor patients to determine if their brain cancer has progressed," said Dr. Woodworth, who also serves as Director of the Brain Tumor Program at the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMGCCC). Such biomarkers have been used in other cancers to determine whether the tumor has remained stable or has the potential to progress or even metastasize. "These liquid biomarkers were found to be closely concordant with the patient outcomes over time, progression-free survival and overall survival," said Dr. Woodworth. Glioblastoma is the most common and deadliest type of malignant brain tumor. The five-year survival rate is only 5.5 percent, and patients live an average of 14 to 16 months after diagnosis when treated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy when appropriate. The malignancy nearly always recurs even after it is removed due to residual infiltrating cancer cells that remain after treatment. The blood-brain barrier is a specialized network of vascular and brain cells that acts as the brain's security system to protect against invasion by dangerous toxins and microbes. It can be opened temporarily using a specialized focused ultrasound device. This process starts with injecting microscopic inert gas-filled bubbles into the patient's bloodstream. Prior studies led by Dr. Woodworth and this trial's co-investigators showed that opening the blood-brain barrier temporarily can be safely and feasibly performed in brain tumor patients. "Dr. Woodworth's findings are deeply exciting and a significant step forward for the field," said Taofeek K. Owonikoko, MD, PhD, UMGCCC Executive Director. Future trials could use focused ultrasound alongside other chemotherapy agents to test the effectiveness of drugs never used in brain cancer due to their ineffectiveness at crossing the blood-brain barrier. "This groundbreaking trial has provided a potential new prognostic and therapeutic paradigm for the 15,000 Americans who are diagnosed every year with this deadly form of brain cancer," said UMSOM Dean Mark T. Gladwin, MD, who is the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and Vice President for Medical Affairs at University of Maryland, Baltimore. "The success of this trial brings new momentum and further accelerates investigation of targeted therapies for glioblastoma and other brain cancers. Dr. Woodworth is also the co-leader of a larger diagnostics-focused pivotal focused ultrasound trial in glioblastoma patients called LIBERATE (NCT05383872) in partnership with ReFOCUSED (The Research Consortium for Transcranial Focused UltraSound-Enhanced Drug Delivery & Diagnostics.) ReFOCUSED is a growing group of researchers from over 20 sites across North America whose goal is to use the new opportunities offered by MRI-guided focused ultrasound to improve the clinical outcomes of brain diseases. The LIBERATE trial is currently closed to enrollment. This trial was funded by the device manufacturer Insightec Inc. (Miami, FL), an MRI-guided focused ultrasound device company, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (R21NS113016).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Background: In this study, researchers aimed to understand how general practitioners experience trust in their patients, and how that trust affects patient care. General practitioners' trust in patients was an assumed starting point. General practitioners expressed a lack of trust in some complex patients' ability to navigate the health system, but not in the patients themselves. Trust in patients deepens and develops over time as part of a mutual trusting therapeutic relationship. General practitioners had difficulty trusting patients who were perceived to be manipulating the relationship for secondary gain. Participants attempted to understand their patient's situation and establish a trusting relationship even when this was the case. Implications: Strengthening systems and training that support general practitioners in maintaining trusting relationships, especially with complex or high-needs patients, can improve continuity and quality of care.

They used data from 101,732 adults in the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial cohort who filled out a detailed diet questionnaire when they joined the study (1993–2001). These adults were followed for about 12 years to see who developed lung cancer. Glycemic index: People who ate diets with the highest glycemic index had a higher chance of lung cancer than those with the lowest glycemic index - about 13% higher overall - including higher risks for both non–small cell and small cell lung cancer. Glycemic load: People who ate diets with the highest glycemic load had a lower chance of lung cancer than those with the lowest glycemic load - about 28% lower overall - and the pattern was similar for non–small cell lung cancer. There was no clear link for small cell lung cancer. Implications: Diets that contain fewer amounts of high glycemic index foods and higher amounts of high-quality carbohydrates, such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, may be linked to lower lung cancer risk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Latinos face significant health disparities, especially in chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, and cancer. Primary care clinicians play a critical role in managing and preventing these diseases, yet Latinos face multiple barriers to quality care. In April 2024, the Primary Care Latino Equity Research (PRIMER) Center convened the Latino Primary Care Summit on "Chronic Conditions in Latinos: Trends, Innovations and Care for the Future." This special report summarizes the discussions at the summit and outlines key research areas and the advances needed to answer questions crucial to Latino primary care, outlining seven recommendations. The report urges pairing research with policy partners so evidence moves into practice, consistently disaggregating Latino data, and investing in the mentorship and career advancement of Latino scientists and students. It also calls for expediting implementation research in real-world primary care settings that serve Latino communities and for co-designing communication practices and new technologies with those communities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from University of California San Diego have identified 11 genetic regions linked to delay discounting - the tendency to prefer smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed ones - shedding new light on how impulsive decision-making relates to both mental and physical health. The study, published on Nov. 25, 2025 in Molecular Psychiatry, analyzed genome-wide data from 134,935 23andMe participants and found that the same genetic factors that influence impulsive decision-making also overlap with risks for conditions like obesity, diabetes and other metabolic health issues. Impulsive decision-making is something we all experience, but its biological roots have been surprisingly difficult to pin down. These findings show that delay discounting is not just a behavioral tendency, it is deeply intertwined with genetic pathways involved in brain development, cognition and physical health." Building on a previous genome-wide association study five times smaller, the team mapped 11 independent genetic regions and identified 93 candidate genes associated with delay discounting. Several of these genes were involved in dopamine signaling, neuronal growth metabolic pathways and brain structure - systems also implicated in psychiatric disorders, obesity, chronic pain and educational outcomes. The researchers also conducted a network analysis to determine which biological mechanisms are shared across traits. "We found clusters of overlapping pathways - particularly involving cognition, metabolism and externalizing behaviors - that may explain why delay discounting is a common feature across many mental health conditions," said Abraham A. Palmer, Ph.D., professor and vice chair for basic research in the Department of Psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine and co-author of the study. Additional analyses showed that many associations persisted even after adjusting for cognitive measures such as intelligence and educational attainment, indicating that delay discounting has a partially distinct genetic basis. To explore downstream clinical impacts, the team developed polygenic scores for delay discounting and tested them in a hospital cohort of more than 66,000 individuals. "We identified that these scores, which represent the genetic tendency to favor smaller immediate rewards, were associated with 212 medical outcomes, including type 2 diabetes, chronic pain, ischemic heart disease, mood disorders and tobacco use disorder", said first author Hayley Thorpe, Ph.D., a visiting scholar in Sanchez-Roige's lab and postdoctoral researcher at Western University. "This highlights how impulsive decision-making may influence long-term health risk". "Understanding the genetic and biological roots of delay discounting opens up many new possibilities," Sanchez-Roige said. "In the future, delay discounting could become a clinically useful marker, one that helps us improve behavioral and pharmacological treatments aimed at impulsivity." Unlike many studies that examine the causes of specific disease, "these studies explore the genetic basis of trans-diagnostic genetic tendencies, which are the fundamental building blocks that influence people's behavior throughout life and are interwoven with disease susceptibility, as well as economic and social outcomes" adds Palmer. The authors note that while the study identifies promising genetic targets, future research should explore causal relationships and test whether modifying delay discounting can improve health outcomes. "Delay discounting is measurable, highly heritable and relevant to many aspects of health," Sanchez-Roige added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A controlled feeding study out of South Dakota State University shows that older adults who ate fewer ultra-processed foods naturally consumed fewer calories, lost weight and abdominal fat, and showed improvements in insulin, nutrient-sensing hormones, and inflammation. For decades, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans have urged balance and moderation, yet rates of obesity and other chronic diseases have continued to rise. The Dietary Guidelines currently include no clear directive on ultra-processed foods, but this study shows that when diets meet DGA nutrient goals while minimizing ultra-processed food and ingredients, calorie intake drops and metabolic health improves. Ultra-processed foods are industrial products made by reconstructing parts of whole foods with synthetic additives such as flavors, colors, preservatives, and emulsifiers. They dominate modern diets, providing more than half of U.S. adults' daily calories and about 70 percent of the national food supply. Meals in the study were designed and administered by the university's human nutrition research team, prepared by a professional local chef, and eaten at home by clinical trial participants to reflect everyday eating patterns. Very few feeding trials have examined how ultra-processed foods affect Americans' health. The first major study, conducted entirely inside a research center, compared diets made up of almost entirely ultra-processed foods to diets with none. This second trial tested a more realistic shift, reducing ultra-processed foods from about half of daily calories to about 15 percent within nutritionally balanced menus for free-living older adults in the United States. "Older adults often face metabolic challenges as appetite and energy needs shift," said Dey, the senior author and principal investigator of the study. "We saw that when ultra-processed food intake went down, total calories and metabolic risk markers did too." Saba Vaezi, a doctoral student researcher in Dey's laboratory and first author of the collaborative study, said the findings show that simple substitutions, rather than restrictive dieting, can make measurable differences. "Participants did not count calories or follow complicated weight-loss instructions," she said. The study is among a handful of rigorously controlled feeding trials in free-living older adults that: Older adults completed an 18-week feeding study with two diet periods of eight weeks each, separated by a short break of at least two weeks. One diet was meat-based, featuring pork as the main protein source, and the other was plant-based, centered on lentils, beans and peas. A companion method paper published by Dey and her team in Current Developments in Nutrition confirmed strong participant adherence and described the complex operations that made this real-world feeding study possible. These results suggest that replacing ultra processed food with minimally processed ones can enhance metabolic efficiency and body composition in older adults, within balanced, American Guidelines–aligned diets. The study also demonstrates that high dietary quality and lower processing can be achieved in practical, take-home meal programs. Researchers note that the 18-week trial included a small sample of 36 participants who completed the study, and that larger studies are needed to confirm long-term outcomes. "This study moves past the usual debate over whether plant-based or animal-based diets are better," Dey said. "Both can be health-promoting when foods are simply prepared and nutritionally balanced."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Swallowing difficulties, or dysphagia, affect up to 80% of people with Parkinson's disease and can lead to serious complications, including malnutrition, aspiration and reduced quality of life. With a new three-year, $1.9 million grant from the Department of Defense, Giselle Carnaby, PhD, MPH, a researcher at UT Health San Antonio, the academic health center of The University of Texas at San Antonio, will lead a phase 2, multisite clinical trial to test a novel treatment program designed to strengthen and retrain swallowing function in people with early Parkinson's. The randomized, double-blind clinical trial will enroll about 80 participants who are between the ages of 30 and 90, diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and are active-duty U.S. service members, veterans or direct relatives of service members. This study represents an important step forward for people who struggle with swallowing disorders. We know these problems have a profound effect on health and independence, yet treatment options remain limited." Giselle Carnaby, PhD, MPH, researcher at UT Health San Antonio, professor in the departments of Health Sciences, and Communication Sciences and Disorders, School of Health Professions, The University of Texas at San Antonio There is no cure for this disease, and treatments are limited. In Parkinson's disease, the same neurodegenerative changes that impair walking and speech also disrupt swallowing-related brain pathways, weakening their ability to send clear signals to the muscles involved. "You can still hear the signal, but it doesn't always get through clearly. This communication breakdown can cause food or liquid to move more slowly, get held up or even enter the airway – called aspiration – which can lead to persistent coughing and lung infections. By targeting these brain-muscle connections with structured swallowing therapy, Carnaby and her team aim to retrain and bolster the physiological processes to support safe, effective swallowing. Carnaby and her research team recently completed a pilot study that tested an intensive swallowing exercise program in a small group of Parkinson's patients. Participants practiced targeted swallowing tasks with therapist supervision, emphasizing both strength and muscle coordination. Participants who completed the program showed improvements in swallowing, along with increased confidence in eating and fewer choking and coughing episodes. "Even though Parkinson's is progressive, what we found in the pilot was that patients could make real, meaningful gains," Carnaby said. "That gave us the validation to pursue a larger, controlled trial." The newly funded project will expand on this early work. The primary recruitment site will be Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, which has a movement disorders clinic with specialized neurologists and neurophysiologists involved in the project. In addition to Carnaby, the study team includes Jonathan Gelfond, MD, PhD, associate professor and chief of biostatistics in the Department of Population Health Sciences within UT San Antonio's Long School of Medicine, as well as Lt. Col. Alexis Nelson, MD, and Maj. Jessie Jacobson, DO, who are both neurologists at Brooke Army Medical Center. The research team will track improvements in swallowing along with longer-term outcomes at three and six months. These include swallowing clinical metrics, aspiration rates, nutritional status and hospitalizations. Study participants will complete structured swallowing exercises twice a week, focusing on strengthening muscles of the mouth, tongue and throat, combined with coordination drills to improve timing and control of the swallowing process. Sessions will continue for six weeks with trained speech-language pathologists at the university. "We're trying to recalibrate motor pathways so that swallowing becomes safer and more efficient." Equally important, Carnaby said, are the psychological and social benefits. "Being able to share a meal with family without fear of coughing and choking is incredibly powerful," she said. "We hope this therapy will give patients more confidence and independence in their daily lives." If successful, the trial could lay the groundwork for widespread adoption of proactive swallowing intervention as a standard component of early Parkinson's care. Carnaby envisions future studies that refine and personalize this therapy, possibly combining the swallowing exercises with medications or neuromodulation approaches to further enhance outcomes. "There's a need for therapies that go beyond symptom management alone to address the mechanisms of functional decline," she said. "This is about giving patients more time and a better quality of life," Carnaby said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a study led by researchers at Mass General Brigham, pregnant individuals who stopped taking popular weight loss GLP-1 medications before or early in their pregnancy tended to gain more weight and have higher risks of diabetes and hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, and experienced preterm delivery more so than people who had never taken GLP-1 drugs. The use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists-or GLP-1RAs-has increased dramatically, but recommendations suggest their discontinuation before pregnancy because there's not enough information about their safety for unborn babies. We sought to assess how such discontinuation affects weight gain and outcomes during pregnancy." Jacqueline Maya, MD, lead author, pediatric endocrinologist, Mass General Brigham for Children Each woman with a GLP-1RA prescription within three years before and up to 90 days after conception was matched to three similar pregnancies where the mother did not use GLP-1RAs. Individuals who stopped GLP-1RAs before or in early pregnancy gained an average of 7.2 pounds more weight during pregnancy than those who did not use the weight loss drugs. The GLP-1RA group also had a 32% higher risk of excess weight gain (gaining more than recommended), a 30% higher risk of diabetes during pregnancy, a 29% higher risk of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, and a 34% higher risk of preterm delivery. There were no differences in risk of high or low birth weight, birth length, or Cesarean delivery. "Additional studies are needed on the balance of pre-pregnancy benefits of GLP-1s with the risks associated with interrupting them for pregnancy," said senior author Camille E.
