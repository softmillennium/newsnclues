                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For people who are interested in searching for extraterrestrial life, the “Wow!” signal is one of the most famous events ever recorded. On that day, a narrowband radio signal was received and recorded. Days later, Jerry Ehman, an astronomer, reviewed the data and something jumped out at him. The signal sequence had a pattern that was nothing like the normal background noise that is always present. This pattern lasted for 73 seconds, so it was much more than just a little blip. For over four decades now, this signal has been studied formally and informally by thousands of people, and none of them have been able to come up with a satisfactory answer as to where the signal came from. There have been many attempts to explain the signal, but they have all either been ruled out or lack any type of strong support that would prove them true. signal is highly suggestive of extraterrestrial intelligent origin, but little more can be said until it returns for further study.” The latest studies, which are published on arXiv (here and here) have not yet been peer reviewed, but they do offer detailed information about the signal itself in a way that is much clearer than would have been available before. “Our study did not conclude that the Wow! However, null results are instrumental in refining future technosignature searches. NASA and other agencies remain committed to their search for biosignatures within the atmospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets.” Publishing this information will open the door for future researchers to have better information that can help to hopefully further narrow down where this signal came from.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 1956 book favored by UFO believers that is considered "an enduring classic in the fields of new religious studies, cult research, and social psychology," is being called into question as a potential lie, according to Anna Merlan in Mother Jones. "The book is gripping, an in-depth social and psychological study of Martin's group and how they behaved, both as it was forming and after their prophetic visions failed to take place," Merlan explains, adding that "it has served as a key basis for the psychological concept of cognitive dissonance." That theory "was taken further by Festinger, who wrote a widely-cited followup book on cognitive dissonance and how people try to engage in 'dissonance reduction' to reduce the psychological pressure and unease they experience when confronted with conflicting information," she notes. But a new study that examined Festinger's recently unsealed papers claims that the book "leans on lies, omissions and serious manipulation," Merlan says. Thomas Kelly, the author of the article, says "while core members of the group stayed active in UFO spaces, they did not keep insisting on a world-ending flood, or that aliens would land and take them away." The Seekers, Kelly notes, were quick to disavow those beliefs and eventually rebranded. The group's leader Dorothy Martin "distanced herself completely from these events, even rewriting the story of how she developed her psychic powers," Kelly writes. "Kelly's paper not only undercuts the researchers' claims and their application of the theory developed from them, but also alleges they committed scientific misconduct, including 'fabricated psychic messages, covert manipulation, and interference in a child welfare investigation,'" Merlan explains. Merlan notes that this interpretation is key, "because the thesis of When Prophecy Fails is clear: after Martin's failed prophecy, her group doubled down, not only by refusing to acknowledge that their core predictions had utterly failed, but banding together with a new zeal to spread them." "This author ends up doing what he accuses the authors of When Prophecy Fails of doing, which is cherrypicking evidence," Saha says of Kelly, adding, “if we want to critique the methods and think about how methodology has changed in 70 years, I would encourage that. We're talking about different academic and scholarly methods 70 years ago around things like participant observation.” Thibault Le Texier, an associate researcher at France's European Centre for Sociology and Political Science, says that "There are findings that people want to hear and findings that people don't want to hear,” and regardless of what people believe, the book will probably continue to "gain a lot of attention in spite of being debunked." The aliens, it must be said, have not yet landed."</p>

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Paranormal fiction is basically a “best of all worlds” situation: It blends the escapism of fantasy with the inspired realism of science fiction, while also dabbling in practically every other literary genre, from horror to romance and everything in between. In a nutshell, the paranormal genre refers to books dealing with concepts or figures that can't currently be explained by science but could maybe, possibly be one day—think ghosts, psychics, werewolves, and vampires—in contrast to the fantasy and supernatural genres, which encompass topics that operate completely beyond our natural world. Here, we've rounded up 15 of the best paranormal fiction books out there, spanning horror, romance, and mystery, from spooky classics like Dracula to a ghostly new love story from Nicholas Sparks and M. Night Shyamalan—with a stop in Forks, Washington, along the way for all the Twihards out there. The classic Gothic horror novel tells the story of a mysterious nobleman who begins terrorizing the residents of an English town after moving away from his Transylvanian castle, prompting a group led by Abraham Van Helsing to hunt him down. Even if you're already familiar with the story, if you haven't read the actual text, it's worth sinking your teeth into. Shirley Jackson's terrifying tale has long been lauded as one of the best haunted house stories ever written. It delves into a series of sinister phenomena that not only occur at the titular abode but seem to be caused by the home itself. Stanley Kubrick's iconic 1980 psychological horror film is based on Stephen King's 1977 book, in which a family moves into the secluded Overlook Hotel during its off-season. I may not have been able to read this book anywhere close to bedtime, but that didn't stop me from zooming through it. In Marcus Kliewer's novel, a mysterious family shows up at a young couple's door, claiming that the father grew up in the home and wants to show his family around…and then they just won't leave. Buckle up: There's an entire Reddit community full of theories and additional clues just waiting for you to dive in once you're done reading. This first book in Victoria Laurie's cozy mystery series introduces Abby, a crime-solving P.I.—psychic intuitive, that is—as she scrambles to catch the killer of one of her clients. The 2004 novel kicked off a series that now features 15 books. The most recent in the series hit shelves in 2017 and was based on Laurie's own experiences as a professional psychic. Bestselling author Simone St. James's 2015 book is set in the 1920s and is a genre-defying story that combines paranormal happenings with historical fiction, classic mystery, and a dash of romance. Birdie Devine, a detective in Victorian London, finds herself tasked with unraveling the mystery of the kidnapping of a child who's rumored to have supernatural powers. Ali Hazelwood is the prolific writer of rom-coms such as Love, Theoretically, and she first experimented with the paranormal romance subgenre with this 2024 novel. The book follows a vampire forced into an arranged marriage with a werewolf to help keep the peace between their rival factions. In the realm on the other side known as Overlay City, she teams up with a psychic empath and a werewolf detective to uncover the truth about her death…and, maybe, to share some very spicy afterlife experiences. Reigning kings of romance and psychological thrillers Nicholas Sparks and M. Night Shyamalan, respectively, teamed up for this “supernatural love story,” which is already set to become a movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Phoebe Dynevor. The novel follows architect Tate on a visit to Cape Cod, where he quickly begins falling for a woman named Wren, who challenges him to broaden his worldview beyond the easily explainable. The two decide to work together to finish the song in hopes of finally getting it out of their heads (and hearts).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>London is full of grand old hotels but The Langham stands out - And no, it is not just for its long history, polished interiors and famous afternoon tea, but also for a story that still follows it around. Everything was normal until one late night when a very unexpected incident took place. Like paceman Stuart Broad says, they have a particular reason to be spooked during matches in London after ghostly goings. I went to his room and he said exactly the same thing! Neither of us could sleep because we were so spooked out. Matt was in a twin room so I ended up sharing with him." Ethiopia Volcano Eruption Disrupts Air Travel: Flights Cancelled Across India - Check Affected Routes & Refund Process 7 Destinations Around the World to Celebrate Christmas & New Year 2025–26 According to an Instagram video, which is going viral, Broad woke up after he felt that the room was heating up. Suddenly, he saw a big fluorescent ball floating in his room, the tap water running in the bathroom with sound of footsteps. This is when he decided to run to his teammate Matt's room, which was on the same floor and told him about the experience he had. Matt then told him that he had the same experience. The hotel, which first opened in 1865, has always been known for its old-world charm. It has tall ceilings, classic woodwork and long hallways that have seen generations of guests walk through. With that kind of history, it surely is not surprising that people have their own theories about what might linger in such an old building. For most visitors, The Langham is a peaceful and elegant place to stay. Senior Copy Editor at Times Network, Akanksha Arora covers Lifestyle, Cult... View More</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A continuous feedback loop of media reporting, political opportunism, protest groups and social media algorithms are fuelling the spread of conspiracy theories rather than one specific cause, says new findings from the Researching Europe, Digitalisation and Conspiracy Theories (REDACT) project. A series of reports published by the pan-European research project, led by Professor Clare Birchall, Professor of Contemporary Culture in the Department of English, shows how conspiracy theories differ by country due to social, historical and political factors. The REDACT project is funded by CHANSE: a collaboration between 27 funding organisations from 24 countries. Fourteen researchers from around Europe produced seven reports looking into some of the unique aspects of how mis- and disinformation circulate online. Yet in recent years, conspiracy theories have become increasingly widespread and normalised, rather than merely on the sidelines of society. Downplaying their impact or dismissing them does not make these theories disappear – it actually allows them to take up all the oxygen on a topic and dominate discussion. Although conspiracy theories were once seen as existing on the fringes of society, the research shows that politicians and news coverage often contribute to these theories going viral. This creates a ‘feedback loop' between the internet, protest groups, political parties and mainstream media reporting, blurring distinctions between the online and offline spread of conspiracy theories. The specifics of the conspiracy theory vary by country, but reflect anxiety about changing cultural values and demographics, even in spaces where levels of immigration are, in fact, low. While Great Replacement talk certainly travels online, particularly on channels with lax or no moderation, its most influential disseminators are not social media pundits or the algorithms that amplify them but politicians using every platform available – both online and offline – to leverage anxiety about demographic change. This signals a shifting Overton window, where once-fringe ideas now shape political rhetoric. While all the countries featured in the research do have connections to global conspiracist movements, they have their own forms of homegrown conspiracy culture too. This specificity must be considered when developing solutions, rather than importing a one-size-fits-all model from another country or region. Many theories develop when people feel their genuine concerns are not listened to. This developed into fears around ‘15-minute cities', where conspiracists claimed people would be restricted in moving about their own towns. Post-pandemic conspiracism is also marked by its agility… This allows conspiracism to evade moderation, feed alarmist media coverage and be exploited by populist politicians. For German-speaking nations – Germany, Austria and Switzerland – believers seek out conspiracies online rather than coming across them by chance. Often conspiracy theories emerge in the comments of a social media post rather than in the original post itself. Voices have increasingly emerged that portray NGOs as part of a larger globalist plot, questioning both their independence and their good intentions. This greatly hinders the work of these organisations, as it can damage their reputation, lead to the suspension of funding streams, or – in the worst case – result in staff members being targeted with hate messages and threats. History has significantly influenced the reasons for this. George Orwell's dystopian-novel, 1984, is referenced frequently by conspiracists online, as it resonates with the public's memories of repression, surveillance and censorship – which is used to add emotional force. Each community views itself as the historic casualty of external manipulation, making conspiracy explanations psychologically plausible and politically useful. Unlike in Germany – where conspiracy theories are often relegated to fringe spaces – there is overlap with mainstream political and media narratives here. This has fed into interpretations of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, where news reports and political elites have invoked national traumas from the 1990s and lingering loyalties to other nations – reawakening nationalist leanings and a sense of threat. Popular conspiracies fixate on gender ideology and the LGBTQ+ community, labelling activists as national enemies akin to Nazi occupiers and Communists. Fixation on these issues is imported from the US, rather than homegrown in Poland. Due to lack of evidence within their own country of conspiracist concerns being realised, users search online for ‘evidence' and examples that back up their claims. Slovakia – a country with very high levels of conspiracist belief – also focuses conspiracy theories on gender and LGBTQ+ ideology. More than a mere “culture war” or opinion-based opposition to rights, anti-gender and anti-LGBTQ discourses function as a political technology using conspiratorial claims with tangible effects on policy and civic freedoms. There are a range of solutions to combatting conspiracy theories, such as improving media literacy, debunking, prebunking, and fact-checking. While none offer a complete solution, each has their place. REDACT found that solutions must be tailored to countries and regions in order to tackle the root causes of their local conspiracy theories. Funding for the counter-disinformation sector can be patchy, with many organisations conscious of the optics of who they take money from. For example, receiving money from governments could be seen to impact an organisation's impartiality. The UK's offering focuses on illegal and harmful content but does not explicitly address health misinformation, election-related disinformation, or AI-generated content, leaving significant gaps in tackling systemic risks. In contrast, the EU's act imposes broader obligations, including risk assessments, transparency for political advertising, and measures against disinformation and algorithmic manipulation. While the latter is stymied by the threat of tariffs from the US, REDACT's research suggests that it can in theory hold very large platforms accountable and has rules on how platforms should moderate content, including disinformation. The UK also lacks a constitutional free speech clause, removing a legal shield often cited in the US to defend disinformation. Nonetheless, British libel laws are often viewed as favouring wealthy plaintiffs over journalists. Such posts offer caution to alarmist accounts of uncontested, untrammelled conspiracism online. These ideas are spreading in all parts of society. If we want to tackle the problem of conspiracy theories, it's not enough to turn off a particular pipeline, such as putting restrictions on a specific social media platform or shutting down someone's account. And instead of focusing on why people don't trust institutions and politicians, we should work on making them worthy of trust. The Researching Europe, Digitalisation and Conspiracy Theories (REDACT) project analyses how digitalisation shapes the form, content and consequences of conspiracy theories. Rather than see digitalisation as a process that has universal outcomes, or conspiracy theories as the same over space and time, REDACT considers online conspiracy theories and counter-publics in different European regions (Western Europe, Central Europe, the Baltics, and the Balkans) in order to make robust and nuanced recommendations about conspiracy theories for policy makers, media regulators, fact-checking and extremism-monitoring organisations, as well as the internet companies themselves.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a landmark collaboration, India and Japan are joining forces to build one of the world's most ambitious astronomical instruments - the Thirty Metre Telescope (TMT). This cutting-edge optical-infrared telescope, with a massive 30-metre primary mirror, promises to revolutionise our understanding of the universe and could even answer humanity's most profound question: Are we alone? The TMT project is an international partnership involving India, Japan, and two leading US universities. Its primary goal is to peer deeper into the cosmos than ever before, studying black holes, distant galaxies, and, most intriguingly, searching for signs of life beyond Earth. "Astronomers want to have a bigger mirror to collect more light from the distant universe," explained Dr. Saku Tsuneta, Vice Chair of the Committee on National Space Policy at Japan's Cabinet Office, Tokyo. The TMT's 30-metre mirror will dwarf existing telescopes, enabling unprecedented clarity and depth in observations. This complex engineering feat requires cutting-edge technology-and that's where India plays a pivotal role. "The location and angle of each mirror has to be carefully adjusted. India's contribution lies in developing opto-mechanical systems that ensure these mirrors remain perfectly aligned, a critical requirement for the telescope's success. This collaboration underscores India's growing stature in global science and technology partnerships. India is a founder-member partner in this project, which aims to open new windows to the universe through optical and infrared astronomy. The chosen site for TMT is Mauna Kea in Hawaii, at an altitude of 4,000 metres – a location renowned for its clear skies and minimal atmospheric interference. Japan already operates an 8.2-metre telescope there, which has been delivering ground breaking observations for over 25 years. "Our primary site for construction is Mauna Kea in Hawaii," Dr. Tsuneta confirmed. "This is one of the best sites for astronomical observation." Mauna Kea is considered sacred by Native Hawaiian communities, leading to protests against construction. Negotiations are ongoing to address cultural concerns and seek consent. "We don't want to build a telescope without their permission," Dr. Tsuneta emphasised. Interestingly, alternative sites have been discussed, including Hanle in Ladakh, India, which already hosts a high-altitude observatory. While no decision has been made, the possibility reflects India's growing role in global astronomy. It will study black holes, map distant galaxies, and probe the early universe. But its most exciting mission is the search for extraterrestrial life. "One of the important purposes is to find life on another planet other than Earth," said Dr. Tsuneta. "Astronomers believe there are other life forms elsewhere, distant from Earth. This telescope will find the signature of life forms in planetary systems belonging to other stars – not our Sun." This means TMT will analyse exoplanets – planets orbiting stars outside our solar system – for chemical signatures that indicate life, such as water vapour or organic molecules. Technological development is progressing well, thanks to contributions from partner nations, particularly India's precision engineering. "Technologically, thanks to the Indian contribution, progress is in good shape," Dr. Tsuneta noted. "Younger people should get a Nobel Prize, not me. Now, with TMT, they aim to look for life among the stars.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Supernatural will always be known as a horror-fantasy series first and foremost, there's no denying that some of the most memorable of Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester's (Jensen Ackles) adventures are those that also include a little humor. So, instead of trying to make your way through the full show, some of the best episodes you could hunker down with are those more comedic hours that show us that Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki can do more than battle demons, monsters, and angels, but they can also make us laugh too. In a sense, these three episodes form an unofficial trilogy of comedic Winchester adventures that, although not connected directly by their respective seasons or circumstances, speak to many of the same issues that Sam and Dean face over and again. Not only are each of them stand-outs in their own respective seasons, but they each deal with similar themes of personal fears and failures while forcing the Winchesters through a routine case that turns out to be a bit more humorous (and out of the box) than they bargained for. On their own, each of these episodes rules, but together, we can see the progression. Beginning with "Mystery Spot," this Sam-centric episode is your typical Groundhog Day-inspired fare, with Sam reliving the same horrible day over and over. But what's fairly lighthearted and comedic at first turns into a waking nightmare for Sam, who continues to relive his worst fear again and again: not being able to save Dean. No, Dean doesn't get stuck in his own endless Tuesday time-warp, but he is forced to face his own fears when he contracts a spiritual ghost sickness that attaches itself to those of a certain personality type ("dicks," as Sam would say). Dean becomes cartoonishly afraid of everything this side of his own shadow, and the whole thing culminates for him when he is confronted by his greatest fear of all: his time in Hell between seasons. It's a harrowing revelation that Dean, contrary to what he told his younger brother, still remembers what happened down under, and he's terrified of getting back there again — and of losing Sam to his dark side along the way. In both episodes, each brother is forced to face his greatest fears, dealt with through humor and a levity that makes them easily digestible for the audience. Of course, last but certainly not least is Season 10's "Fan Fiction." After so many years fighting, winning, losing, and stopping apocalypse after apocalypse, the two are confronted with the fact that — at least to some young schoolgirls — they're heroes. Considering that Supernatural was always meant to be a horror show, we should note that these aren't the only episodes where the Winchesters encounter their deepest fears, challenges, or regrets. There are plenty of great episodes out there to binge, but if you're looking for some Supernatural highlights that really speak to the heart of the show while still making you laugh, these three are among the best. "Mystery Spot" includes some of the most iconic moments on the show, and was notorious for being Jared Padalecki's least favorite episode to film. "Yellow Fever" is not only downright hilarious, but it features Jensen Ackles singing "Eye of the Tiger" before the end credits roll. Plus, if you're anything like us, you've already binged through the entire show more than once, so why not just stop at some of these notable rest stops before the show leaves Netflix behind? After all, the show is consistently one of the streamers' most-watched programs, and in an age where comfort shows often make more of a dent than million-dollar eight-episode productions, Supernatural will definitely be missed. There's a high chance that Sam and Dean will reappear on HBO Max since that's where the sequel/spin-off series The Winchesters is currently streaming, but no official announcement has been made. Those of us will home video copies won't be without the Winchesters for long, but here's hoping that they make their way to the streaming world again sometime soon — at least before Ackles and Padalecki get together for a revival season. Supernatural is available to stream on Netflix until mid-December. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.</p>
