No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.” The other lawmakers speaking in the video are Sen. Mark Kelly (Arizona) and Representatives Chris Deluzio (Pennsylvania), Maggie Goodlander (New Hampshire), Chrissy Houlahan (Pennsylvania), and Jason Crow (Colorado). Trump Threatens Six Lawmakers With Sedition Charges and Hanging Their words, which constituted a correct statement of the law, elicited unprecedented vitriol from Trump, who wrote on Truth Social: “It's called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL.” “Right now, the threats to our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad, but from right here at home … You must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.” In a second post, Trump wrote: “This is really bad, and Dangerous to our Country. President DJT.” And he added in a third post: “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Trump also reposted a statement saying: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD ! Our servicemembers should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. It is not only the right thing to do, but also our duty.” Now the Department of War is investigating Kelly for “serious allegations of misconduct,” threatening to call him back to active duty and court-martial him. The Department's “Official Statement” posted on X adds, “All servicemembers are reminded that they have a legal obligation under the UCMJ to obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful.” But they fail to add that servicemembers also have a legal duty to disobey unlawful orders, which is what Kelly and his fellow lawmakers accurately stated in their video. Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), a servicemember can be punished by court-martial for refusing to obey any lawful order or regulation. The manual also says that although it may be inferred that an order to perform a military duty or act is lawful, “this inference does not apply to a patently illegal order, such as one that directs the commission of a crime.” The Rules for Courts-Martial say that acting “pursuant to orders” is a legitimate defense “unless the accused knew the orders to be unlawful or a person of ordinary sense and understanding would have known the orders to be unlawful.” Finally, the manual notes, “The lawfulness of an order is a question of law to be determined by the military judge.” Normally, that determination can be made only after a servicemember refuses or disobeys an order, in a court martial or war crimes tribunal. Examples of unlawful orders within the United States include: Examples of unlawful orders outside the United States include: “Servicemembers should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders.” Ultimately, Calley only served over three years of house arrest and confinement to barracks. But there is a noble tradition in the United States of servicemembers refusing orders to deploy to illegal wars and/or commit war crimes. Many have argued in their defense that they had a legal duty to disobey illegal orders. Levy thought that Black soldiers were being used as cannon fodder for the illegal Vietnam War. He felt they would use their medical training to gain the trust of the Vietnamese people who would then not oppose U.S. troops carrying out their illegal missions. Levy, who called this the “prostitution of medicine,” thought these Green Berets were committing war crimes. In 1967, Levy was charged by court-martial with willfully disobeying a lawful command by his superior officer, conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, and publicly uttering statements to enlisted personnel with design to promote disloyalty and disaffection among the troops. Resistance to George W. Bush's illegal Afghanistan and Iraq Wars was also widespread. Many resisters were inspired by their predecessors who had resisted the Vietnam War. I would have testified about the Nuremberg Charter, United Nations Charter, Geneva Conventions, Uniform Code of Military Justice, and Army Field Manual. Although the government sought a second court-martial in which Watada would face six years in custody and a dishonorable discharge, the judge said double jeopardy had attached. Watada's heroism arose in his conclusion that the invasion of Iraq was unlawful, that his participation in that unlawful invasion would abet an unlawful war of aggression, and that he would be willing to accept the consequences of his refusal to participate, despite great personal sacrifices, including nearly-total alienation from his comrades-in-arms, the potential for a lengthy prison term, and the hatred and scorn heaped upon him by untold numbers of misguided citizens,” Kenneth Kagan, one of Watada's lawyers, told Kathleen Gilberd and me for our 2009 book, Rules of Disengagement: The Politics and Honor of Military Dissent. “I have been deeply moved by his courage and steadfastness throughout.” I was allowed to testify as an expert at the 2005 court-martial of U.S. Navy Petty Officer Third Class Pablo Paredes, who refused orders to board an amphibious assault ship that would transport 3,000 Marines to Iraq because he thought he would be complicit as a war criminal. The Navy charged Paredes with unauthorized absence and missing his ship's movement by design. Before sentencing, Paredes told the judge, “I am guilty of believing this war is illegal. I am guilty of believing war in all forms is immoral and useless, and I am guilty of believing that as a service member I have a duty to refuse to participate in this War because it is illegal.” He added, “I believe as a member of the armed forces, beyond having a duty to my chain of command and my President, I have a higher duty to my conscience and to participate in any way, hands-on or indirect, in the current aggression that has been unleashed on Iraq.” I testified that the Iraq War violated the UN Charter, and that Paredes had a reasonable belief that by transporting Marines to Iraq, he would place them in the position of committing war crimes. I explained how U.S. forces were torturing prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison, which constituted war crimes. Then I said that both the Nuremberg Principles and the Uniform Code of Military Justice established a duty to obey lawful orders but also a duty to disobey unlawful orders. I concluded that orders to board the ship and transport Marines to fight in an illegal war and potentially commit war crimes were unlawful. Although the government sought nine months in the brig, forfeiture of pay and allowances, and a bad conduct discharge, the judge sentenced Paredes to no jail time and refused to order a bad conduct discharge. He gave Paredes two months restriction to the base, three months of hard labor without confinement, and a reduction in rank to seaman recruit. “From the Vietnam War to the present, dissident soldiers have spoken out in opposition to illegitimate wars and in doing so have expanded soldiers' right to dissent,” Gilberd and I wrote in our Rules of Disengagement book. “Their legal challenges and political efforts have broadened the rights of other servicemembers opposed to a war or oppressive military policies.” After the six members of Congress released their bold video, Veterans For Peace said in a statement: We call on all veterans to stand with these members of Congress and amplify their message so that Airmen, Marines, Seamen, and Army troops know that if they ever face the difficult challenge of refusing an illegal order, they are carrying out their oath to defend the Constitution by following the law. There are groups, including the GI Rights Hotline, the Center on Conscience and War, and the Military Law Task Force, that work with servicemembers to help them recognize when they have received an unlawful order and figure out their next steps.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fighter jets track two uncrewed aircraft in first daytime breach of Romanian airspace since full-scale Ukraine war German Typhoon and Romanian F-16 fighter jets took off in pairs to follow the uncrewed aircraft. The first flew back into Ukrainian airspace, but the second was later found downed in Puieşti, about 70 miles from Ukraine. Ionuț Moşteanu, Romania's defence minister, said two of the German pilots had been given orders to shoot down the second drone. People in three Romanian border counties were told to take cover in the morning until the incident was resolved. Six drones also crossed into Moldova's airspace overnight, according to the country's defence ministry. One of them, a distinctive delta-wing model with a Russian Z symbol spray painted on the tailfin, landed on a roof in the village of Cuhureştii de Jos, 15 miles from the Ukrainian border. They suggested the drone had landed when it ran out of fuel. However, using fighter jets to shoot down drones is an expensive way to deal with the threat – and not always practical because of the dangers of bringing down a Russian or unknown craft above a populated area. Gen Christopher Donahue, the commander of the US army in Europe and Africa, said on a visit to Romania's Mihail Kogǎlniceanu airbase that a new capability to shoot down drones would be deployed to the country. “We have tested and it is in the final stages of being employed. Romanian soldiers and other alliance soldiers have been trained on this capability and I know you're going to see this capability in the delta [of the Danube] very soon,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. The Texas Tribune is a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues. Texas Education Commissioner Mike Morath recently met with a top official from Turning Point USA to discuss creating chapters of the conservative youth organization in all of the state's high schools, days before Lt. Gov. The meeting between Morath and Turning Point USA Senior Director Josh Thifault took place on Nov. 3 in Austin, according to records obtained by The Texas Tribune. After their meeting, Thifault followed up with Morath via email to provide additional information about the right-wing group's existing partnerships with Florida and Oklahoma. “Both states have issued stern warnings against anyone attempting to stop students from forming Club America chapters,” Thifault wrote, referring to the official name of the clubs. It is unclear if Morath formally agreed to a partnership with Turning Point USA or on any next steps. Responding to questions from the Tribune about the meeting, including how such a partnership would work and what precedent exists of the commissioner meeting with national politically affiliated organizations, Texas Education Agency spokesperson Jake Kobersky said, “Commissioner Morath meets with a variety of stakeholders interested in public education.” Thifault did not respond to an email, phone call or text message for comment about the meeting. Turning Point USA organizers have said they received tens of thousands of new inquiries about starting local chapters while claiming that students looking to participate in the organization have encountered administrative pushback. Officials in at least two states outside of Texas — Florida and Oklahoma — have announced plans to establish Turning Point USA clubs on their high school campuses. Earlier this month, four days after Morath and Thifault met, Patrick spoke out in support of establishing chapters of Turning Point USA on every Texas college and high school campus. Texas has more than 1,200 public school districts and charters that educate roughly 5.5 million students. The Turning Point USA clubs promote themselves as champions of “American exceptionalism, the importance of constitutional rights, and standing for freedom,” according to their website. They aim to “build strong networks, spearhead impactful initiatives, help students register to vote, and inspire meaningful conversations about the foundations of a free society,” the website states. The organization's work on college campuses — including a so-called professor watchlist targeting instructors it sees as promoting liberal viewpoints — has also stirred tension as faculty members say they have faced harassment from conservatives. Ricky Adam Jr., the Texas regional manager for Turning Point USA, told lawmakers during a Nov. 12 legislative hearing that he has heard from “so many students across the state who want to get involved and want to talk peacefully and respectfully with their classmates about topics they deem important.” “We have a huge announcement just around the corner, so stay tuned.” Turning Point USA did not respond to the Tribune's request for comment. The meeting between Morath and Thifault happened several weeks after the Texas education chief announced that his agency would investigate hundreds of complaints concerning teachers accused of making inappropriate remarks about Kirk's killing. Legal experts and teacher advocacy groups criticized the investigation, calling it an attack on educators' right to free speech. “Some of those complaints are clearly people that are personally settling scores with others they don't like, and those cases will just get closed,” Morath said. Capo told the Tribune in September that Morath, who was appointed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, was getting involved in politics by criticizing comments he personally disliked, rather than leaving it to school districts and the general public to submit any reports of alleged misconduct.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was the dark hair on the back of the neck, hands and chin of the elderly woman renewing her identity card that first tipped off authorities to an alleged crime and led to the arrest of a 57-year-old man in northern Italy. The man, whose name has not been released by authorities, is the son of Graziella Dall'Oglio, who died in 2022 at age 82 in the town of Borgo Virgilio, close to the city of Mantua, a spokesperson at the Mantua police precinct told CNN on Tuesday. Police say the man, a former nurse who is currently unemployed, did not report her death to authorities. When the elderly woman's identity card expired, the son put on makeup, a wig and her clothes in order to pose as his mother and renew her card – something that must be done in person in Italy, the spokesperson said. Police met him there, the spokesperson said. Officers then went to the elderly woman's home address and found her mummified body in the laundry room closet, wrapped in sleeping bags, they added. The man is accused of concealing a corpse, fraud against the state, impersonation, and forgery of a public document, the spokesperson said. He is accused of removing fluids from his mother's body with a syringe to prevent decomposition, and an autopsy has been ordered to determine how she died. A family of five was living off-grid in a remote cabin in central Italy. State pension fraud is common in Italy, with dozens of people arrested every year for impersonating someone who has died to collect their pension, according to statistics from the Italian financial crime police, known as the Guardia di Finanza. As the country's death registries and public services are not always in sync it can take years to report deaths, which means that pension checks continue to be sent out until someone notifies the local pension office from which they are dispatched.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>State department proposes excluding 38 institutions from Diplomacy Lab partnership including Harvard and Yale More than three dozen universities including Harvard, Yale, Stanford and Duke have their participation in a federal research partnership on the chopping block after the state department proposed to suspend them over their diversity, equity and inclusion hiring practices. Last week, the Guardian obtained an internal memo and spreadsheet showing that the state department is moving to exclude 38 institutions from the Diplomacy Lab program, which pairs university researchers with state department policy offices on foreign policy projects. Several of these moved to comply with the administration's anti-DEI demands earlier this year – Columbia agreed in July to pay more than $200m to the federal government and pledged not to use “race, color, sex or national origin” in hiring decisions, while the University of Virginia's president resigned in June after the justice department demanded he step down over the school's diversity practices. Peter Trumbore, chair of the political science department and Diplomacy Lab campus coordinator at Oakland University, which would have its funding suspended, said they've received no notification of a change. “Our students have had invaluable experiences conducting research on behalf of State and working with State Department stakeholders in producing and presenting their work.” The University of Southern California said in a statement: “The university complies with all applicable federal nondiscrimination laws and does not engage in any unlawful DEI hiring practices. Sarah Voigt, director of communications at St Catherine University, said the school had been participating since 2020 and was first notified of a pause in Diplomacy Lab activities earlier this year on 31 January, with the program shut down “due to a lack of government funding” and did not apply for any Fall 2025 research opportunities. She added: “At this time, we are not aware of any decision to exclude St Catherine University from future research opportunities.” The 17 November memo states that an office within the state department's bureau of public affairs will update criteria to “only include institutions with merit-based hiring practices” and exclude those with DEI hiring policies, whether implemented openly or discreetly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's military intelligence agency has revealed new details of Russia's Shahed-107 attack drone used to strike front-line areas, publishing technical data on Nov. 25 that it says show the drone is packed with foreign-made components despite Western sanctions. As is the case with other types of Shahed drones, Iran and Russia rely on electronic components from Western and other countries, such as the U.S., Switzerland, China, Japan, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and Ireland, for Shahed-107 production, according to HUR. "Iranian weapons continue to undergo combat testing on Ukrainian soil — in confrontation with Western defense technologies," HUR, subordinate to the Defense Ministry, said on Telegram. Russian troops have been deploying Shahed-type drones, relatively cheap, self-destructing loitering munitions for nearly a year on the front, but they appear to be building additional launch sites, such as at the Russian-occupied Luhansk airport, to further intensify their usage, Ukrainian aviation expert Anatolii Khrapchynskyi said in August.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's military intelligence agency has revealed new details of Russia's Shahed-107 attack drone used to strike front-line areas, publishing technical data on Nov. 25 that it says show the drone is packed with foreign-made components despite Western sanctions. As is the case with other types of Shahed drones, Iran and Russia rely on electronic components from Western and other countries, such as the U.S., Switzerland, China, Japan, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and Ireland, for Shahed-107 production, according to HUR. "Iranian weapons continue to undergo combat testing on Ukrainian soil — in confrontation with Western defense technologies," HUR, subordinate to the Defense Ministry, said on Telegram. Russian troops have been deploying Shahed-type drones, relatively cheap, self-destructing loitering munitions for nearly a year on the front, but they appear to be building additional launch sites, such as at the Russian-occupied Luhansk airport, to further intensify their usage, Ukrainian aviation expert Anatolii Khrapchynskyi said in August.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Vatican has issued a warning against the rise of polyamory, insisting marriage is the stable, lifelong and exclusive partnership between a man and woman. A new document defending monogamy, signed off by Pope Leo XIV, was written as “various public forms of non-monogamous unions – sometimes called ‘polyamory' – are growing in the West,” the text said. It also followed discussions with Roman Catholic bishops in Africa about polygamy, which has been described as a “pastoral challenge” for the church in the region and was discussed by Vatican assemblies (synods) in 2023 and 2024. Polygamy tends to refer to one man with multiple wives, while polyamory involves people having multiple consensual romantic relationships at once. “Polygamy, adultery, or polyamory are based on the illusion that the intensity of the relationship can be found in a succession of faces,” states the doctrinal note, titled “One Flesh – In Praise of Monogamy.” “Our age, in fact, is experiencing various drifts with regard to love: an increase in divorces, the fragility of unions, the trivialization of adultery, and the promotion of polyamory.” Catholic Church must do more to help sexual abuse survivors and hold church leaders to account, hard-hitting report says The note also says it is highlighting a development in the church's understanding of sex within marriage: namely that is about more than having children. In Catholic understanding, sex within marriage has two aspects: the “unitive,” which brings the couple closer together and can reflect divine love, and the “procreative,” meaning having children. Catholic teaching forbids the use of artificial contraception – a prohibition upheld by recent popes but which has been hotly debated and rejected by some in the church. The latest doctrinal note says that “unity is the founding property” of marriage and that the “unitive purpose of sexuality… is not limited to ensuring procreation.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The retail giant is emerging as one of China's artificial-intelligence leaders.ALY SONG/Reuters Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba BABA-N beat analysts' estimates for quarterly revenue on Tuesday as investments in one-hour delivery helped drive more users to its shopping apps, while its cloud division reported strong growth. U.S.-listed shares of the company rose 4 per cent in premarket trading. Alibaba's results come against the backdrop of a costly battle in China's “instant retail” sector – which Alibaba calls “quick commerce” – where major players are pouring billions into one-hour delivery services to capture market share. Net profit fell 53 per cent to 20.61-billion yuan, though that was still higher than analysts had expected. Alibaba is less exposed than rivals, yet it sees long-term upside, projecting instant retail could add 1-trillion yuan in annualized gross merchandise value – or GMV, a commonly used metric for e-commerce sales – over the next three years. Analysts eye China ‘Singles Day' sales as many consumers cut back China's Singles' Day sales period – the longest on record, stretching from early October to Nov. 11 – also saw retailers roll out heavy subsidies and discounts to spur demand. Its Taobao marketplace launched Singles' Day promotions in more than 20 countries. Alibaba has been making aggressive moves to expand into the consumer artificial-intelligence market, an area in which it has traditionally lagged rivals as it focused instead on enterprise clients. Recently it launched a free app built on the latest version of its Qwen large language model, which surpassed 10 million downloads within its first week. Alibaba's consumer-facing shift comes amid an intensifying price war in China's domestic AI market, sparked by DeepSeek's focus on low-cost computing and app development – a strategy that has forced rivals to slash prices and follow suit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's the brainchild of University of Toronto health studies graduate Vishar Yaghoubian, who has become one of Canada's most hyped emerging entrepreneurs, winning $200,000-plus in prizes from more than 25 startup competitions based on the idea. She has attracted big-name investors to back her eight-person company, including New York hedge fund manager Mark Diker, Dragon's Den star Michele Romanow and Michael Cloutier, a former AstraZeneca Canada president. U of T promotes Ms. Yaghoubian as one of its emerging entrepreneurial stars, and she already has a flourishing online presence, with 11,500 followers on Instagram (where she once did a sponsored post for Doritos), nearly twice as many on TikTok and 8,400 on LinkedIn. “She is a brand unto herself,” says Lesley Ross, general partner of Enjoy the Work, a Silicon Valley group that advises startup founder CEOs, including Ms. Yaghoubian. Now, the vibrant, intense 25-year-old Torontonian is set to discover what the market thinks and try living up to a reputation that precedes any actual business success. Already nearly half of Toothpod's initial run of 216,000 pieces (which retail for $1 each) are spoken for in advance orders; a second run is under way and Toothpod's U.S. contract manufacturer can make one million of the disc-shaped chewables a week. “I'm ecstatic, relieved, because it's real,” Ms. Yaghoubian said of the launch. One of her first clients is an Atlanta cosmetic dentistry business whose celebrity clientele includes music stars Usher and Nicki Minaj. “They're all excited for it,” says Colleen McFarlin, vice-president of the DCA's specialty division. “I think it's a game-changer in the industry and should be part of the standard of care in every daily routine.” Toothpod combines three natural ingredients that have been shown in studies to have a positive impact on oral health: hydroxyapatite, which helps re-mineralize teeth and is used in specialty toothpaste brands including Sensodyne; magnolia bark extract, which decreases bacteria in the mouth that cause bad breath and tooth decay; and resveratrol, a plant extract with anti-inflammatory properties. Toothpod also contains xylitol, a sweetener used in other gums that reduces plaque, gingival bleeding and inflammation. The company has received a provisional patent and is now pursuing clinical validation: An American university is about to begin a trial of 50 healthy adults who will chew the product four times daily for two weeks to see if it delivers oral health benefits. The founders claim that early, non-clinical tests show that chewing the product for a few minutes removes twice as much plaque as other xylitol gums. I want something that will make an actual difference in the world. Challenged in the competition to come up with a business idea within 24 hours, she did an internet search on the world's top problems. She discovered cavities were a big chronic health issue, despite the fact people have used toothbrushes for centuries. Her idea was to create a portable oral care product that people could use on the go. While juggling her studies, a job coaching the women's varsity basketball team and two terms on U of T's governing council, she started building her company in earnest. She reached out to hundreds of academics for help and zeroed in on the three active ingredients she thought her product should include. In 2021, she recruited Brian Webb, a biomechanical engineering PhD student at U of T, to help with product development. By late 2021, they zeroed in on gum as their product. Working in their kitchens, they tested dozens of formulations. Mr. Webb says he would break chunks of chicle – a brown natural gum base – into wells of a muffin tin, warming them on his stove and mixing in various measurements of ingredients to see what worked. He learned the active ingredients had to be carefully mixed in or they would create a burning sensation or bitter taste when chewed. Finally, Mr. Webb came up with the winning concoction some time in 2023. “We were so surprised by how delicious it was,” she says. By early 2024, the first batch of commercial-grade 500 sample pieces – each 16 millimetres in diameter and eight millimetres tall, which is larger than a typical piece of gum – was ready to send to clinics and investors. Within months, Ms. Yaghoubian had raised $850,000, on top of $450,000 in government grants. “There's nothing like it and I believe there is tremendous value that will be created as we move through commercialization of the brand,” said Mr. Cloutier, who has backed 10 startups. Ms. Yaghoubian says “selling will be the least of our issues. “The key risk in this business will be inventory management and working capital,” says Reza Satchu, co-founder of Next Canada, a program for high-potential student founders, where Ms. Yaghoubian earned the people's choice award last year. The company will need to raise more funds and ensure further product ambitions – like developing a mouthwash – don't stretch its resources too thinly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US has formally labeled the ‘Cartel of the Suns', a purported criminal syndicate said to operate within Venezuela's security services, as a foreign terrorist organization – placing it in the same category as Al-Qaeda and Islamic State. The move comes after nearly two months of US airstrikes on small boats off Venezuela's coast, which the Pentagon says are aimed at “narcoterrorism” and which have left around 80 people dead. The term ‘Cartel of the Suns' originated in the 1990s as a media reference to alleged corruption among Venezuelan military officers who reportedly wore Sun-shaped insignia on their uniforms. In 2020, the US indicted Maduro and 14 current or former officials on accusations of drug trafficking and organized crime, claiming that they collectively ran the cartel. Numerous analysts and regional leaders, however, have cast doubt on the cartel's existence. While acknowledging that individual officials may be involved in illicit schemes, skeptics argue that claims of a centralized, hierarchical criminal enterprise are unfounded. Colombian President Gustavo Petro dismissed the Cartel of the Suns as a “fictional excuse of the far right to bring down governments that do not obey them.” During US President Donald Trump's first term, Washington recognized opposition figure Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader, though his subsequent attempts to overthrow Maduro failed. The recent US strikes in the Caribbean, combined with a buildup of military assets in the region, have fueled speculation that Washington may be preparing for a renewed effort to remove Maduro from power.

BEIJING, November 25. /TASS/. The total value of Russia's natural resources exceeds $100 trillion, which is nearly twice that of the United States, Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin said at the Russia-China Energy Business Forum.

"Russia, with its unique resource base, can guarantee the energy security of all Eurasia. The total value of our country's natural wealth amounts to nearly $100 trillion, which is almost twice the comparable figure for the United States," he said.

Sechin noted that Russia is a key player in the global energy market, accounting for approximately 15% of global hydrocarbon exports.</p>
