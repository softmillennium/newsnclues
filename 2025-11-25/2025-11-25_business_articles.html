                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FBI is seeking to interview Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and five other congressional Democrats in connection with their appearance in a video encouraging members of the U.S. military to refuse to follow illegal orders, several of those lawmakers confirmed Tuesday. President Donald Trump last week blasted the video, accusing Kelly and the other lawmakers of "seditious behavior," calling them "traitors," and saying that, "In the old days, if you said a thing like that, that was punishable by death." The other lawmakers on the video were Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, as well as House Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania. "President Trump is using the FBI as a tool to intimidate and harass members of Congress," Goodlander, Crow, Deluzio, and Houlahan said in a joint statement. "No amount of intimidation or  harassment will ever stop us from doing our jobs and honoring our Constitution," the lawmakers said. That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep  it. Fox News first reported on the FBI's efforts. Earlier Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth lashed out online over Kelly's display of his U.S. Navy medals after the Pentagon began investigating him for encouraging service members to refuse to obey unlawful orders. "So 'Captain' Kelly, not only did your sedition video intentionally undercut good order & discipline … but you can't even display your uniform correctly," Hegseth snapped in a post on X, which replied to a tweet by Kelly showing his medals. "Your medals are out of order & rows reversed. The Pentagon on Monday said it was investigating "serious allegations of misconduct" against Kelly, who is a retired Navy captain, for his role in the video. The Pentagon said Kelly could be recalled to active military duty and face a possible court-martial for potential violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The UCMJ requires service members to obey "any lawful general order or regulation." Kelly, in response Monday, posted on X a statement saying that the Pentagon's probe "won't work" if "this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable." His post also included a close-up photo of Kelly in his Naval uniform, showing the medals on the shirt's breast pocket. "Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders," Kelly said on the video, which was tweeted on Nov. 18 by Slotkin of Michigan, a former CIA analyst. Slotkin wrote in her tweet: "We want to speak directly to members of the Military and the Intelligence Community. The video was made as the U.S. military, under Trump, has carried out more than 20 airstrikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean against purported drug smugglers, killing scores of people on those vessels. The legality of those strikes, which were made without congressional authorization, has been questioned. On Monday, a group of Democratic senators, including Kelly and Slotkin, wrote Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi to request that they declassify a Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel's written opinion from September on the domestic and international legal basis for the strikes. "We therefore believe that the declassification and public release of this important document would enhance transparency in the use of deadly force by our Nation's military and is necessary to ensure Congress and the American people are fully informed of the legal justification supporting these strikes," it said.

Campbell Soup Company put an executive on leave while investigating claims made in a lawsuit that he trashed the company behind closed doors, including mocking its "poor" customers and saying the company's meat "came from a 3D printer." In a statement Tuesday, the company said the alleged comments by Martin Bally, Campbell's vice president of information technology, were "unacceptable." "Such language does not reflect our values and the culture of our company," the company said. "We do not tolerate that kind of language under any circumstances." The move follows a lawsuit filed Thursday in a Michigan court by Robert Garza, a former cybersecurity analyst at the company who said he was fired after complaining about Bally. The recording was not included as an exhibit in the lawsuit, and Business Insider hasn't independently authenticated it. "Even in a can of soup — I look at it, and look at bioengineered meat," the person said. "I don't want to eat a fucking piece of chicken that came from a 3D printer, do you?" Elsewhere in the recorded conversation, the person recounts an instance where he tried to help a colleague with a tech issue. He blamed "Indians" in an expletive-filled rant for not resolving it without him. Bally didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. In its statement Tuesday, Campbell said the remarks about its food were "patently absurd" and that the chicken meat in its soups "comes from long-trusted, USDA approved U.S. "Keep in mind, the alleged comments heard on the audio were made by a person in IT, who has nothing to do with how we make our food," the company said. Despite Campbell's denials, the remarks about bioengineered and 3D-printed chicken have bounced around social media and drawn the attention of Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, who said he would investigate the company. "Florida law bans lab-grown meat," Uthmeier posted on X. "Our Consumer Protection division is launching an investigation and will demand answers from Campbell's." He bemoaned the lack of innovation in the food industry and said the company overpaid for its 2023 acquisition of Sovos Brands, which makes Rao's pasta sauce, for $2.7 billion. Somebody else manufactures it for us," he said, calling the situation "smoke and mirrors."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The fight between Nvidia and one of its loudest naysayers, investor Michael Burry, is escalating. "Nvidia emailed a memo to Wall Street sell side analysts to push back on my arguments on SBC and Depreciation. I stand by my analysis," Burry said in a post on Substack, referring to stock-based compensation. Burry has repeatedly warned that today's AI infrastructure frenzy mirrors the late-1990s telecom buildout far more than the dot-com wipeouts investors remember. He pointed to massive capex plans, extended depreciation schedules and soaring valuations as evidence that markets are again mistaking a supply boom for durable demand. The Nvidia memo, first reported by Barron's, responded to Burry's criticism towards Nvidia's stock-based compensation dilution and stock buybacks. "NVIDIA repurchased $91B shares since 2018, not $112.5B; Mr. Burry appears to have incorrectly included RSU taxes," the memo said. NVIDIA's employee compensation is consistent with that of peers. Employees benefitting from a rising share price does not indicate the original equity grants were excessive at the time of issuance. "The memo also disputed Burry's claims around depreciation life. To Burry's charge that customers are overstating the useful lives of Nvidia's graphics processing units in order to justify runaway capital expenditures, Nvidia counters that its customers depreciate GPUs over four to six years based on real-world longevity and utilization patterns. Nvidia added that older GPUs such as A100s, released in 2020, continue to run at high utilization rates and retain meaningful economic value well beyond the two to three years claimed by critics. The memo also rejects Burry's suggestion of "circular financing," saying Nvidia's strategic investments represent a small fraction of revenue and that AI startups raise capital predominantly from outside investors. Burry said he believes Nvidia now occupies the same position that Cisco — the key hardware supplier that powered a massive capital investment cycle — held in 1999-2000. Just as telecommunication companies spent tens of billions of dollars laying fiber optic cable and buying Cisco gear based on forecasts that "internet traffic doubles every 100 days," today's hyperscalers are promising nearly $3 trillion in AI infrastructure spending over the next three years, Burry said in a Substack newsletter. The heart of his Cisco analogy is overbuilt supply meeting far less demand than expected. In the early 2000s, less than 5% of U.S. fiber capacity was operational, Burry said. Today, he believes the industry's belief in boundless AI demand rests on similarly optimistic assumptions about data center power and GPU longevity, he said. "And once again there is a Cisco at the center of it all, with the picks and shovels for all and the expansive vision to go with it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TSMC on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against a former senior vice president it accused of leaking "confidential information" to Intel. Wei-Jen Lo joined Intel after 21 years at TSMC, having left in July, the Taiwanese chip maker said in a statement, announcing the lawsuit. The lawsuit is based on Lo's employment contract and non-compete agreement with TSMC, and regulations such as the Trade Secrets Act, the statement said. "There is a high probability that Lo uses, leaks, discloses, delivers, or transfers TSMC's trade secrets and confidential information to Intel," it said. TSMC's share price fell on Tuesday and was last seen over 3% lower. Intel did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. It follows earlier reports by local media and later by Reuters, which stated Lo may have taken TSMC's technology data to Intel. Taiwan's High Prosecutors opened an investigation into the allegations. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan told Bloomberg News last week that his "company respects intellectual property rights" and denied any wrongdoing. The U.S. firm's stock price moved 1.5% lower in mid-morning trade. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Nvidia stock dropped on Tuesday as investors took in a report that Meta could buy billions worth of Google's AI chips in the coming years. The Facebook parent is currently one of Nvidia's biggest chip customers. But Nvidia wasn't the only chip name to suffer sharp losses. The Information reported that Meta could incorporate Google's tensor processing units in its data centers several years from now, and could start renting TPUs from the company as soon as next year. Meta, one of the most voracious spenders in the AI trade, has said it could spend as much as $72 billion on capital expenditures next year, much of which is expected to be invested in AI infrastructure. "Google Cloud is experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and NVIDIA GPUs; we are committed to supporting both, as we have for years," an Alphabet spokesperson told Business Insider. Meta and Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider. Semiconductor stocks were broadly in the red on Tuesday, with the exception of Broadcom, which helps Google design and manufacture its chips. Broadcom stock jumped 11% on Monday as investors piled in as another way to bet on Google's growing dominance in the AI arms race. Shares of the GPU producer initially popped after it reported stellar earnings for the third quarter, but then started to drop as fears of an AI bubble crept back into the picture. Nvidia shares are down 12% from their peak in late October. Shares have rallied 18% over the past month and are up 67% in 2025. "Alphabet is the only large player trading in positive territory this morning. It's fair to say that investors seem quite nervous currently," David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note of the recent volatility in the tech sector.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following is the unofficial transcript of a CNBC interview with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on CNBC's "Squawk Box" (M-F, 6AM-9AM ET) today, Tuesday, November 25. All references must be sourced to CNBC. BECKY QUICK:  Welcome back to "Squawk Box." President Trump announcing that he will be visiting Beijing in April following a phone call with Chinese President Xi. The two continued their discussions on China's agreement to purchase U.S. soybeans while the U.S. lowers tariffs on China. Joining us right now with more on the U.S.-China trade latest is Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. And, Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for being with us this morning. QUICK: Why don't we start with this latest? What we're seeing right now and what we've heard from this conversation with President Trump and President Xi. Obviously, the United States has a very important push on making sure that China does step up its purchases of soybeans. And they are right on schedule. QUICK:  There have been some reports coming from China where their take on this talk is a little different. At least what they emphasized in the talks was a little different. They bring up both Ukraine and the U.S. position, and the China, Chinese position on Taiwan. What is the U.S. position on Taiwan at this point? BESSENT:  U.S. position on Taiwan is unchanged. And on Ukraine, President and Party Chair Xi agreed that the peace in this Ukraine conflict, they must move forward, and they agreed to work together on it. QUICK: Am I right to think that this is a truce, but maybe a little bit of an uneasy truce at this point? How secure and settled are you feeling with where we stand with China right now? President Trump showing leadership that sort of calm things down between the two countries. And look, we're always going to be rivals. But are there things we can do together? Yes, we have the relationship in a good place. So, if there are four meetings during the year, I think that that gives the relationship great stability and stability is good for the American people and good for the world economy. ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Mr. Secretary, I wanted to pivot the conversation. We've been talking all fall with you about the prospect of the president selecting a new Fed chair. And as we get closer to the end of the year, I wanted to get an update as to where things perhaps stand right now. We have five very strong candidates. I'm impressed with all of them. And, Andrew, I'll tell you, one of the things in terms of the criteria that I've been looking for, that I have morphed a bit on in the fall when we started with 11 candidates, is in talking to these candidates, I realize the Fed has become this very complicated operation. It's no longer just a price setting of money. We often talk about the two Kevins, Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, being the frontrunners. BESSENT: Andrew, I'm, still got one interview left, so I don't think it would be prudent to give any hints. And I think that there's very good chance that the president will make an announcement before Christmas. But things are moving along very well. QUICK: Mr. Secretary, last week the president, I'm not sure if he was joking or how serious he was about it. He said he loves everything you're doing, but if you don't get the Fed to lower interest rates soon, he might fire your butt. And you know, the, again, I think that we've gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated and it's more than just cutting rates. You know, the Fed has taken us into a new regime in what is called ample reserves regime. And it looks like that might be fraying a bit here in terms of whether the reserves are actually ample in the system. There are all these facilities and operations, the standing repo facility. And I think we've got to kind of simplify things. The other thing too, is that when you were on with Steve Liesman, you were showing all the Fed governors and the regional bank presidents kind of like baseball cards. And I think it's time for the Fed to just to move back into the background, like it used to do, calm things down and work for the American people, set monetary policy on a good course. And I think we just need to calm down. QUICK: Well, to be fair, the Fed governors, you know, the presidents of the banks at least are hearing from people in their districts and each of them maybe hearing slightly different things about where the job market lays, where inflation lays. And that's probably useful information to hear from around the country. That's not what they're talking about in their district. QUICK: Well, Susan Collins was saying she hears about inflation. She was just on last week with Steve Liesman, the Boston Fed president. And she was saying that she does hear a lot about inflation from within her district. BESSENT: Well, the other thing I'll tell you that I find very interesting is, you know, these regional presidents were supposed to be people from the district, and it was supposed to break the New York hold on the reserve banks. And, you know, we've got at least three, maybe four of the reserve banks where people were hired from outside the district. They are going out into the country and then coming back on weekends. SORKIN: Mr. Secretary, I'm curious how you grapple with this question. The president and I believe you yourself have talked about perhaps the need to lower interest rates. The president has clearly made that case. You know, if you, if you listen to some of these Fed governors, including Neel Kashkari and others, as they're trying to balance what appears to be, you know, an increase in unemployment or seemingly a little bit more unemployment against inflation fears -- how do you balance that in your mind right now, given the sort of clash of those two issues? And what I think is interesting is that the governors seem to be leaning toward cutting rates. And you know, again, Andrew, what I want to go back to is we've now got this very complicated calculus. And I think that the mistake that we're seeing a lot of times is either looking at them of looking in the rearview mirror, we're flying a little blind with the numbers here, but we've had two cuts thus far. That the Schumer shutdown, the longest in history, has shaved 1.5 percent of GDP, at least an $11 billion permanent hit. So, we know the economy hasn't gotten better. So, I'm not even sure what the discussion is here. It was a curveball, I think, for all of us. It does seem like they were at least buddy-buddy on the issue of affordability. BESSENT: Well, Andrew, I was in the room, and I think that you've got to have some admiration for a candidate who ran a campaign the way he did. And I think it speaks to how open minded the president is that he invited him into the Oval. I don't even know if he's met with him. And President Trump wants the best for New Yorkers. I can tell you my impression of the mayor-elect is he's a young man with a lot of old ideas that have never worked. And point, point to one example where policies like his have led to anything other than a decline. But President Trump wants the best for the American people, and he hopes that New York will do well. It's easy to run a campaign, but the practical everyday of keeping, keeping people safe, picking up the trash, making the subways run on time, we'll see. QUICK:  Secretary Bessent, affordability has certainly been the keyword, particularly since those elections, not just of Mamdani but of the Democrats who won in both New Jersey and in Virginia. And there are a lot of questions about how to get our arms around those things. The ACA tax credits being a big issue, too. There were reports that yesterday, the president had been considering saying that he would extend the Obamacare tax subsidies at least for a year until things can get worked out. But I wonder if you could tell us what the administration's plan is on this front, what you think the best way forward is just in terms of trying to figure how, what to do on both a short-term and a long-term basis? BESSENT: Well, let's go back and just talk about affordability. It was immigration, interest rates, inflation. We can come back to it. Immigrate, this mass, unfettered immigration is now under control. The border's secure, which couldn't be done. That was putting substantial downward pressure on working class wages, upward pressure on rent for working people. Two, interest rates have come down. The bond market has had its best year since 2020. And now, we're working on the inflation. They wanted, we'll reopen the government if you'll talk about health care. And now here we are kind of on the eve. But I'm not involved in the conversation. I know President Trump wants working Americans to keep more of their money, cut out the insurance companies, and we'll see. He's the president of solutions, and I'm sure that we will have a solution to this. QUICK: The front page of "The Wall Street Journal" has an article today talking about how the economy is kind of addicted to AI spending. It points out that business investment in AI might have accounted for as much as half of the growth in the gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, in the first six months of the year, and questions whether if growth in that sector slows down, whether it tanks the entire economy. So, Becky, two weeks ago, I was at my hometown in Charleston, South Carolina. Boeing was doing a substantial expansion of their plant for the Dreamliner, thousands new great high-paying jobs. And I think next year, all the trade deals, and thanks to the tax bill, we're going to see, we're going to see a broadening out of the CapEx cycle. And historically, CapEx always leads to more jobs. This AI build out has been tremendous. And you know, I would echo what my friend Joe Lonsdale said, that in the competition with the Chinese, this is pass-fail. That if we don't maintain our AI leadership, then everything else we're doing will be put to the side. But I'm very excited about the prospects for substantial non-inflationary growth last year because also the deregulation is going to kick in. And, you know, to go back to your question on the Fed, this is where I think we may be the, in a 1990s scenario. And Alan Greenspan had the ability to have a framework before looking, look at the productivity that was going on. And I think we're seeing that same kind of productivity here. So that's why I think you can have lower interest rates, higher growth and higher productivity. QUICK: Secretary Bessent, thank you for your time. And tell Joe I hope he feels better.

The American F-35 stealth fighters that participated in the Operation Midnight Hammer strikes on Iran flew hundreds of miles deep into its airspace and were the last ones out, US military commanders revealed this week. F-35A Lightning II aircraft assigned to the Utah-based 388th Fighter Wing escorted the B-2 Spirit stealth bombers that dropped over a dozen heavy bunker-buster bombs on Iran's nuclear facilities in late June. "We employed weapons to great effect against multiple surface-to-air missile sites." US officials said Tehran did not fire at any American aircraft during Midnight Hammer. The F-35 pilots can use the jet's stealth, radar, targeting systems, and advanced sensors to detect surface-to-air missile threats, as they did in Iran. The F-35 fighter, built by US defense giant Lockheed Martin, has been battle-tested against a wide range of threats in a mix of engagements since its first flight nearly 20 years ago — from Middle East wars to penetrating Israeli strikes inside Iran to the downing of Russian drones over NATO territory. While the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is considered a top fifth-generation fighter jet, it is also the world's most expensive weapons program, with a lifetime cost of $2 trillion, and has faced sustainability and maintenance challenges in recent years, leading several Trump allies to publicly criticize the aircraft and its capabilities. However, Midnight Hammer commanders praised the F-35 and said that its participation in the operation highlights its combat prowess. "The effectiveness of this strike validated all of the capabilities of the F-35 we've been talking about for years — stealth, lethality, sensor-fusion, being a force multiplier," said Col. Charles Fallon, 388th Fighter Wing commander. He said the operation relied on the F-35 pilots and their aircraft to perform, "and both proved more than capable." US forces struck three Iranian nuclear facilities — specifically Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan — with 75 precision weapons during Operation Midnight Hammer, which came amid a broader war between Iran and Israel.</p>

Private Credit Boom:

Wall Street's top prosecutor has a warning for private-market players getting creative with their numbers.

Stark divergences in how competing firms value private assets in their portfolios are drawing increasing attention from market participants, academics — and, now, the Department of Justice, according to Jay Clayton, the head of its Manhattan outpost.</p>

Huge price declines aren't anything new for bitcoin investors. The highly volatile digital asset tends to serve as a proxy for risk appetite and liquidity, plunging when investors become cautious over macroeconomic or market risks. But bitcoin's current pullback, which now amounts to more than 30% from its recent all-time high, is different than prior declines, and could be more difficult to recover from, Deutsche Bank analysts wrote on Monday. Deutsche Bank cited a couple of factors that distinguish the current bear market. "Unlike prior crashes, driven primarily by retail speculation, this year's downturn has occurred amid substantial institutional participation, policy developments, and global macro trends." While institutional participation has boosted gains over the last couple of years, it's that very same exposure to bitcoin that has also now contributed to a feedback loop of falling liquidity and heightened selling, DB said. "Thinning liquidity across Bitcoin order books has limited the crypto's ability to significantly recover from macro headwinds," Deutsche Bank wrote. "Whether Bitcoin stabilizes after this correction remains uncertain," Laboure added. She continued: "Looking ahead, Bitcoin's maturation will likely continue in phases. Greater regulatory clarity — especially from recent crypto market structure reforms — could support institutional confidence, while the adoption of stablecoins by major institutions may bolster market liquidity."

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants employees to use AI whenever they can — and he insists they shouldn't worry about losing their jobs in the process. In an all-hands meeting on Thursday, the day after the chipmaker reported record earnings, Huang responded to a question about managers instructing employees to use AI less. "My understanding is Nvidia has some managers who are telling their people to use less AI," he said at the meeting, which Business Insider listened to. "I want every task that is possible to be automated with artificial intelligence to be automated with artificial intelligence," he said. Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Nvidia isn't alone, as tech giants have taken measures to push employees to incorporate more AI into their day-to-day work. Both Microsoft and Meta plan to evaluate employees based on their AI usage, and Google told engineers to use AI for coding, Business Insider reported. Amazon was in talks to adopt the AI coding assistant Cursor after employees requested it, according to Business Insider's reporting. "Jump in and help make it better, because we have the power to do so." Though fear of job loss has been a constant drumbeat amid the rise of AI, Huang suggested Nvidia employees shouldn't worry. He said that while other tech companies have conducted layoffs, Nvidia had hired "several thousand" people last quarter, which he joked was putting a strain on office parking spaces. "Frankly, I think we're probably still about 10,000 short," Huang said, "but the pace at which we hire should be consistent with the pace at which we can integrate and harmonize the new employees." Nvidia has significantly expanded its workforce, increasing from 29,600 employees at the end of fiscal 2024 to 36,000 employees at the end of fiscal 2025. Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of over $4 trillion. Recently, investor Michael Burry of "The Big Short" has been taking aim at Nvidia, voicing skepticism about the AI boom. Nvidia pushed back on these criticisms in a memo to Wall Street analysts, Business Insider reported Monday.</p>
