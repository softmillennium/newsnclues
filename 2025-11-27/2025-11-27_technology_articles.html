Amazon has been dropping the price on this flagship Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 512GB phone in waves during Black Friday, starting from $1,100 and now falling to just above $1,000 which puts serious pressure on the iPhone 17 Pro lineup: This S25 Ultra with 512GB of storage has fallen to $1,019 from $1,419 and that $400 off a phone that launched earlier this year. The 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED display is just stunning for media consumption and gaming. Colors pop with incredible vibrancy and a 120Hz refresh rate makes scrolling feel incredibly fluid. The titanium frame adds durability and a premium feel that's immediately noticeable. This phone feels expensive because it is, and the build quality reflects that. Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the display protects it from scratches and drops. You're holding hardware that's built to last years of daily abuse. Demanding games, 4K video editing, and power user multitasking are handled without breaking a sweat. Apps launch instantly, and switching between dozens of open programs stays smooth. The performance gap between this and older flagship phones is noticeable in daily use. It comes fitted with the inbuilt S-Pen which makes this phone a powerhouse in terms of productivity. You can annotate screenshots, sign documents, and sketch ideas without using any extra accessories. AI features are baked throughout the S25 Ultra experience in useful ways. The AI-powered Night Mode dramatically improves low-light photography through intelligent enhancement of details and noise reduction. AI also drives other useful functions, such as real-time translation, smart text selection, and photo editing suggestions. The large 5000mAh battery easily pushes through full days of heavy use without anxiety: Stream videos, take photos, navigate with GPS, and message friends-all without watching the percentage drop alarmingly. Battery capacity is larger than most competitors; this offers genuine all-day confidence.</p>

Wei Shaojun, vice chairman of the China Semiconductor Industry Association and professor at Tsinghua University, said at an industry event that AI accelerators consisting of 14nm logic chiplets and 18nm-based DRAMs developed in China could rival Nvidia's Blackwell processors that are made using a custom 4nm-class process technology at TSMC, reports DigiTimes. Speaking at the ICC Global CEO Summit, Wei Shaojun indicated that the key to performance efficiency breakthrough would be advanced 3D stacking used to build Chinese accelerators. Wei Shaojun — who previously said that goals set by China in the 'Made in China 2025' program were unachievable and who later called on the country to cease using foreign AI accelerators like Nvidia H20 and use domestic solutions instead — described a hypothetical 'fully controllable domestic solution' that would combine 14nm logic with 18nm DRAM using 3D hybrid bonding. There is no evidence that such a solution exists or could be built using technologies that are available in China, so the speech is strictly hypothetical. He believes that such a solution could offer performance of 120 TFLOPS, without revealing specific precision. Furthermore, he claims that it would consume only about 60W of power, thus offering higher performance efficiency (2 TFLOPS per Watt) compared to Intel's Xeon CPUs, according to Wei. B300 delivers 10.7 NVFP4 TFLOPS per Watt, which is five times higher than what the non-existent AI accelerator could offer. The key technologies that are meant to significantly improve the performance efficiency of a hypothetical AI accelerator developed in China are 3D hybrid bonding (copper-to-copper and oxide bonding), which replaces solder bumps with direct copper interconnects at sub-10 µm pitches, as well as near-memory computing. Hybrid bonding with sub-10 µm pitches can enable tens to hundreds of thousands of vertical connections per mm^2, alongside micrometer-scale signal paths for high-bandwidth low-latency interconnects. 2.5 TB/s per device is considerably higher than what HBM3E can deliver, so it could be a breakthrough for AI accelerators that rely on the near-memory computing concept. Wei also said that the concept could theoretically scale toward ZetaFLOPS-level performance, though he did not outline when and how such levels could be reached. Wei identified Nvidia's CUDA platform as a key risk not only for the hypothetical alternative he described, but also for non-Nvidia hardware platforms, as once software, models, and hardware converge on a single proprietary platform, alternative processors become difficult to deploy. Keeping in mind that he envisioned near-memory computing as a way to significantly increase the competitiveness of AI hardware being developed in China, any alternative platform that does not rely on this concept (including Chinese AI accelerators like Huawei's Ascend series or Biren's GPUs) may be considered a problem.

They're bending to an imaginary threat that hasn't even been made yet. Nobody said they would sue them over quoting that line. If anyone it would be Rutger Bregman that gets sued by the Trump administration for saying it, not others reporting on it.And even that seems unlikely as it could make this the biggest example of the Streisand effect in history. Bregman would say "See how corrupt he is? He's silencing journalists discussing his corruption" and get 100x more publicity than his lecture ever got.

Dreame's Black Friday sale is taking up to $800 off the price of their amazingly smart, technologically advanced cleaning machines. These Black Friday deals from Dreame are your signal to call in the big guns. By far the most common human intervention required by robot vacuums is to rescue it after it's beached on an obstacle, but the X50 Ultra's ProLeap system and VersaLift Navigation virtually eliminate that need. VersaLift is Dreame's highly advanced LiDAR system that scans from different heights to give the robot superior mapping and obstacle avoidance abilities. With a clear path charted, the X50 Ultra puts its exceptionally powerful 20,000Pa of Vormax suction power to work, extracting dirt and dust from thick carpets and hard surfaces. It comes with the revolutionary Dual Flex Arm and MopExtend system that reaches into corners and tight spots for comprehensive cleaning. Once finished, the X50 Ultra heads to the AceClean DryBoard dock for recharging and dirt-emptying, plus a fully-automated hot-water wash, rinse, and heated dry of its mop pads. Sit back, relax, and watch the Dreame X50 Ultra do its thing, content in the knowledge it was your best Black Friday splurge at 50% off. But the L50 Ultra isn't one to stay in the shadows, not with its stellar array of cleaning power and advanced tech, and definitely not with a $550 price break for Black Friday that makes it an outstanding deal at just $850. But that still ranks it very, very highly on the overall list of robot cleaners on the market. The threshold-beating ProLeap retractable legs and corner-cleansing Dual Flex Arm systems are present and accounted for, along with a stout 19,500Pa of Vormax suction power and a HyperStream Detangling DuoBrush that conquers hair up to nearly a foot long without suffering those work-stopping brush tangles. The 3.2L dustbag won't need changing for up to 100 days — between 3 and 4 times per year. AI-aided obstacle avoidance using RGB and 3D structured light and LED path illumination means next to no attention is necessary from you, which is the whole point of a robot cleaner. In any other fleet, this is the flagship. With this Black Friday deal, it's most definitely not priced like one. Remember when the mop features on robot vacuums were interesting novelties that functioned far better as conversation pieces than actual cleaning machines? Sure you do, because it was only a few years ago. FluffRoll technology helps keep it clean with a counter-rotating fluffy roller module, and while many robots have retractable mop heads to protect your carpets, the Aqua10 Ultra Roller has Dreame's AutoSeal Roller Guard — an automatically closing cover that creates a barrier between the wet mop and your carpets, and also catches the inevitable drips before they reach your carpet. The roller module isn't just cleaned, it's virtually sanitized. And it wouldn't be a Dreame machine without a highly advanced navigation system, in this case the Astrovision NVIDIA-powered obstacle intelligence that commits hazards like chair legs, toys, and even pets to memory and remembers them for future avoidance. And with a 38% Black Friday deal, it should be at the top of yours as well. The most effective way to clean greasy, grimy, or sticky messes is with heat, preferably hot water. If you're still stuck in full-manual cleaning mode, that's adding more steps and more drudgery — heating water, filling a bucket, hauling the bucket, dealing with the dirty water, etc. Dreame's H15 Pro Heat wet-dry vacuum creates the heat all on its own, with 185 degrees Fahrenheit ThermoRinse cleaning that delivers piping-hot clean water to the mess and puts its heat-resistant spinning brush to work to cut through it and lift it away. It's not robotic — although it does have an AI-powered robotic arm that reaches for edges, baseboards, and corners —  so you do have to push, but beyond that, all you need to do is fill its clean water tank before you start and then dump the dirty water tank when you're done. Place the H15 Pro Heat back on its charging base, and Dreame's ability to create 212 degrees Fahrenheit boiling water awaits. In a short time, the H15 Pro Heat self-cleans and dries, and with quick recharging, it's ready to roll out again. Hardwood- and marble-floor enthusiasts, this one's for you. The Dreame H15 Pro Heat wet-dry vac takes some of the worst floor-cleaning work off your plate and quickly bounces back for more, and it's one of Dreame's better Black Friday deals at just $570. However, they also have a longstanding rep for being short on power and not all that effective. Dreame's Z30 keeps the affordable and easy-to-store parts of the stick vacuum, but adds them to a powerhouse 150,000 RPM TurboMotor that creates 310AW of suction to create a stick-on-steroids cleaning machine. Interchangeable multi-surface and soft roller brushes are part of the Z30 package, with a deshedding tool that prevents hair and fur wraps from knotting up the brush. The Z30 also adds a formidable brain to its cleaning brawn, with intelligent dirt detection that automatically adjusts the suction power and brush speed based on the amount of dirt it encounters. The Black Friday market is going to be jammed with stick vacuums, many in that $250 sweet-spot pricing range. But it's a very safe bet none of them will come with the awesome suction power and smart features of the Dreame Z30.

If you buy something through links on our site, Gizmodo may earn an affiliate commission. I've been onboard the wireless charging train for nearly a decade, and still remember being excited to finally have a device I could try it with when I bought my iPhone 8 in 2017. Wireless charging felt like magic,despite the fact that it was slow and unreliable, that it wasn't all that unusual to pick up your phone to find it was both way too hot and hadn't charged at all. The most recent innovation is Qi2.2, the latest version of the Wireless Charging Consortium's MagSafe-based standard that requires chargers to feature a magnetic ring and be capable of outputting up to 25 watts of power to Qi2.2-compatible phones. That's really good for wireless charging, although without some additional cooling, you can't expect it to hit that rate for very long, if at all. At first glance, it's no different than any other 3-in-1 stand that you can hang iPhones, Apple Watches, and AirPods on for simultaneous charging. Yet there's more to it than that: it's got a cooling fan to keep your phone from throttling the charging rate. It also has a touchscreen, so you can check the charging power going to each device. You can also see that same info in an app that lets you tweak settings, set the time (its timeout screen shows a clock), and even update its firmware. Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station (3-in-1, MagGo, AirCool, Dock Stand) That's all a lot, but the good news is that the Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station works well, especially when it comes to its big banner feature of fast wireless charging for your smartphone. I confirmed with my partner's iPhone 16 that this charger can get up to 22.5W, as Apple says it and others in the 16 line can. And my own iPhone 15 Pro, which isn't explicitly capable of that, still reached about 17W and held it for long-ish stretches. But the end result was a phone that could fully charge nearly as fast as when I charged with USB-C, yet was still cool—and sometimes cold—to the touch when I pulled it off the charging pad. These sorts of charging stands—the kind with two stalks, one for a phone and one for an Apple Watch and a wireless charging pad for AirPods—aren't usually pretty, but Anker sure tried! Its stalks are encased in shiny, reflective metal, the base has nicely grippy feet, and its display seems to sit beneath glass. I am a sucker for screens on devices that don't usually have them, even when they're extraneous; thankfully, the one on the Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station is anything but. Besides offering key info about the charging wattage of each device sitting on it, you can also cycle through a few options to set things like the charging mode, the time and date, and screen brightness. As for those charging modes, they are Ice Mode, which sets the phone charging pad's cooling fan to full blast; Boost Mode, which is a balanced charging mode in which the fan doesn't run as high; and Sleep Mode, which turns the fan off and is probably best if you use the charger at your bedside. It's my firmly held belief that the screen is good enough that the Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station never needed an app at all, but the Anker app connects to it, so we might as well talk about it. When using the app, you'll connect to the charger via Bluetooth, giving you a screen that shows you a picture of the Prime Charging Station, current output wattage, voltage, and amperage, and a “Real-Time Data” line graph. Tap on that, and you can see a few hours' worth of charging history for each of the charging points. It's great that Anker has decided to come out of the gate swinging with its first Qi2.2 charging station. The Prime Wireless Charging Station is inarguably nice and certainly worth more than your average no-name Amazon charger. I really like this charging stand and don't mind calling it one of the best 3-in-1 charging stands you can buy today. It's just too convenient to have one easy place to plop an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods case at the end of the day, and the bar to improve on that is a lot higher than I think any of Anker's extra features reach. I just can't see myself paying $230 for this. Anker seems to know that's perhaps too much, and has already discounted the charger to $150 (as of this writing) within less than two months of it being announced. But that's still more than what competing 3-in-1 Qi2.2 chargers cost; see Belkin and its own cooling fan-equipped Qi2.2 charging stand for $130, or Kuxiu, with its tri-fold Qi2.2 travel charger that's fanless and much more vulnerable to thermal throttling in my testing, but also only costs $100. The Abxylute 3D One is a handheld that tries so many things, and not all of them work. Whether you're on Team iPhone or Android, like flat phones or foldables, we've found the best phones released this year. The latest Nest Doorbell is great hardware plagued by a bad subscription approach.</p>

Govee has evolved into a major player in smart lighting and competes directly with Philips Hue across product categories while consistently undercutting their premium pricing. TV backlighting creates truly immersive viewing experiences by extending on-screen colors onto the wall behind your display and makes action scenes feel more engaging and atmospheric content more enveloping. At $58, down from $89, the TV Backlight 3 Lite designed for 55 to 65-inch TVs has hit a record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday. Govee offers multiple size variants to match different TV dimensions (40-50″ and 75-85″ are also available) with all configurations receiving Black Friday discounts, though this particular model serves the most common living room TV sizes currently dominating the market. The camera system records what appears on your TV screen using a wide-angle lens that takes in the entire screen from a single mounting spot. The fish-eye correction algorithm remedies this issue using image processing where distorted inputs are converted to the proper outputs. The RGBICW LED arrangement combines red, green, blue, independent control, and white LEDs in a single light bead and provides much better color definition than the typical RGB LEDs. The length of 11.8 feet can be considered adequate when routing it through the back perimeter to cover 55-65-inch screens. Unpacking and mounting the product takes anywhere between 20-30 minutes. With a price tag of $58, the Govee's TV backlight comes with camera-enabled screen syncing, fish-eye correction and has a coverage range of 11.8 feet when paired with 55-65 inches screens, all offered at 34% markdown on Black Friday sales.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quentin Tarantino hasn't released a feature since 2019's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and fans of the filmmaker are still waiting to hear what his next film (his 10th, and purportedly his last) will be. (We've long since stopped speculating about his Star Trek movie.) Fresh interest in the Uma Thurman-starring revenge flick—an epic kung fu and yakuza riff that pays homage to Bruce Lee, Sonny Chiba, and beyond, with an anime interlude, sword fights, training montages, rock n' roll sequences, and gore galore—started with the release of Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair in theaters. But if you crave more Kill Bill and long to witness more slicing blades featuring the Bride and her foes, Fortnite is here to serve. The game, long a curious source of exclusive and/or oddball pop culture content, will be rolling out The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge this weekend. Built with Unreal Engine and character models from Fortnite, Tarantino's The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge stars Uma Thurman.” And yes, there's a trailer, which gives us a glimpse of Yuki Yubari herself—the sister of Gogo Yubari, the cute yet terrifying schoolgirl played by Battle Royale standout Chiaki Kuriyama in Kill Bill. Even with all those weapons… our money's still on the Bride. If you want to watch Yuki's Revenge in Fortnite, it premieres November 30 at 2 p.m.; as the blog explains, “You'll be able to find it in the top row of Discover. But if gaming's not your thing, “starting December 5, participating theaters in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom will show Yuki's Revenge as part of an exclusive limited theatrical run of Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair.” Either way, the Kill Bill revival is here to wreck your wedding, bury you alive, rev up your Pussy Wagon, and send you on a cross-country mission to get your daughter back while you plan to (see title). Will you be checking out Yuki's Revenge in Fortnite or making it part of your big-screen re-watch of The Whole Bloody Affair? Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what's next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who. Epic hopes you'll love the Simpsons in 'Fortnite' enough to hop on Rocket League and watch some special animated shorts. Lionsgate is releasing Quentin Tarantino's two-part masterpiece as one film on December 5. Chris ain't the only one shellshocked by how this week's 'Peacemaker' ended, and now 'Fortnite' has another emote controversy on its hands.</p>
