The internationally acclaimed Formula 1 Exhibition opened in Melbourne last night with an exclusive preview event welcoming special guests, media, and motorsport personalities for an unforgettable first look at the immersive experience. Brought to Melbourne by Sony Music and TEG Experiences, and produced by Round Room Live, the exhibition spans over 22,000 square feet across seven purpose-built immersive rooms, showcasing the evolution, innovation and emotion that have defined Formula 1 for more than seven decades. The experience features five iconic F1 cars including Drivers' and Constructors' Championship winners, 60+ helmets, 25+ race suits, 100 exclusive interviews, and 10 racing simulators – giving fans a unique opportunity to step inside the world of Formula 1. Exclusive to Melbourne, the exhibition also showcases Aussie Drive – a dedicated space celebrating Australia's rich legacy in Formula 1. Visitors will start their journey with Once Upon A Time In Formula 1, a gallery experience that brings the sport's defining moments to life through rare photography, video, and personal stories. From there, fans move into the Design Lab, which provides a behind-the-scenes look at how F1 teams create, test and refine the world's fastest race machines. Revolution By Design explores the sport's groundbreaking innovations and the future of F1, with contributions from Lotus, McLaren, Ferrari, Mercedes, Honda, and F1 ACADEMY's Managing Director Susie Wolff, plus more. Visitors then enter Survival, where previously unseen remains of parts of Romain Grosjean's burnt out Haas car – including the steering wheel and a tyre – and his boots and gloves from his dramatic 2020 crash in Bahrain will be displayed. Teamwork, ingenuity, and an unrelenting drive for excellence – the same qualities that propelled Stewart to three World Championships – now fuel his mission off the track. As official charity partner to the exhibition, donations will help fund Race Against Dementia researchers and scientists worldwide, equipping them with Formula 1-inspired mindset training, mentoring and collaboration tools to fast-track discoveries in dementia research. "Every year we see Australia's huge passion for speed and Formula 1, and this show is a true celebration of the country's outstanding contribution to motor racing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>'I certainly would've liked to have a 30-point gap instead of 24' - Norris on title challenge 'We'll go all in' - Verstappen aiming to make title fight 'exciting until the end' Lando Norris has admitted that despite the frustrating double disqualification for McLaren in Las Vegas, nothing has changed within himself or the team as he continues to target his maiden Drivers' Championship crown. The Standings leader and his team mate Oscar Piastri originally finished the Las Vegas Grand Prix in second and fourth respectively, but they were later disqualified from the final result due to excessive skid wear on both cars. Norris' points advantage over the Australian and Red Bull's Max Verstappen was subsequently cut down to 24, but he can nevertheless secure the title if he outscores his rivals by two points over the Qatar Grand Prix weekend. Asked whether he was angered by the disqualification in Las Vegas, Norris replied: “No. I think from what I had to do in the race, there was already some expectation that it might happen so it wasn't a shock or a surprise. Maybe it would have hurt more if we won the race, but we didn't so it doesn't change anything. There's no point being too sad about it. “Of course, everyone in the team was a bit gutted about the result because there's a lot of effort that goes into it. I'm just excited to go again this weekend. He said: “We'll probably be quicker now we have to put it up because I won't have to back off everywhere. “I think I'll just go and try to do the same thing – I'll focus on trying to get a good Qualifying and have a good race and just take it one step at a time. "At the same time, that doesn't change how I do anything. The 26-year-old is within touching distance of his first drivers' title, but he is insistent that his focus is more on extracting the best performance he can across the final two races, even with Piastri and Verstappen close behind. Although the Red Bull driver was over 100 points adrift of the lead at one point, a run of magnificent form has allowed him to rapidly close the gap, leaving Norris more than aware that anything can still happen. “Max won last year and I think he won the year before,” the Briton said of previous races in Qatar. “We come in with the same expectations of thinking it's going to be close. I don't think we come into it expecting anything to be easy. We work hard, we focus on ourselves and the goal is to qualify on pole and win both races. “We didn't do a good enough job [in Las Vegas] so it's quite simple. I feel ready to try and continue the good run that we've had.”</p>
