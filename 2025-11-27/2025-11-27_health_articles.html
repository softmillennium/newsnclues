                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His-tagging is a popular approach for protein purification, screening, and assay development because it enables simple affinity-based capture while preserving protein function. His-tagged proteins have applications in structural biology, binding studies, and medicinal research. Measuring their concentration is critical for assessing expression, maximizing production, and monitoring construct stability. While conventional methods such as SDS-PAGE or nickel-affinity columns can yield reasonable estimations, they frequently necessitate purification, are time-consuming, or lack measurable precision. The sensor-based format provides quick, repeatable results without the need for complex equipment or purification stages. Amperia uses a premix competition assay format to quantify His-tagged proteins. The sensor surface has anti-His capture sites, allowing for selective detection of His-tagged objects. Higher analyte concentrations occupy more sites, lowering detection reagent binding and signal intensity. This inverse signal relationship allows for precise quantification over a wide dynamic range. (3) Premixed sample and HRP-labelled His-tagged detection reagent applied, enabling signal generation. The assay is performed utilizing Amperia's touchscreen-guided workflow, which includes built-in protocol templates that speed plate setup, sensor loading, and automated analysis, resulting in rapid, reproducible results and a simple setup process. Note: Values shown are typical ranges based on internal testing. Actual throughput and hands-on time may vary depending on assay format, sample type, and workflow configuration. Detection range may vary depending on analyte affinity and assay conditions. Amperia allows for the accurate quantification of various His-tagged proteins, with consistent performance across a wide variety of molecular weights and tag configurations. The assay works in complicated matrices, including crude lysates, and provides reliable standard curves for many recombinant targets. Representative standard curves for various His-tagged proteins. His-tagged proteins are employed in a variety of research and development applications. Abselion started in 2018, at that time under the name HexagonFab, in a small corner of a laboratory at the University of Cambridge. We set out with the humble goal to make protein research simpler. Scientists should be able to pursue their passion for discovery and innovation, rather than spend their valuable time with tedious, manual tasks. Over the years we have designed, built and tested our first product Amperia and we're proud to introduce it to the world.​ Sponsored Content Policy: News-Medical.net publishes articles and related content that may be derived from sources where we have existing commercial relationships, provided such content adds value to the core editorial ethos of News-Medical.Net which is to educate and inform site visitors interested in medical research, science, medical devices and treatments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are major global causes of death. However, their global incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years remain largely unknown, despite their importance for disease prevention and resource allocation. We therefore examined the global epidemiology of ALS/MNDs. This study analyzed data from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 database for 204 regions (1990–2021), focusing on ALS/MNDs. Age-standardized incidence rates were reported for the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s. A rising global burden of ALS/MNDs, with significant variations across regions and levels of the social development index, was observed in the Global Burden of Disease database. A significant overlap of etiology between neurological diseases and ALS was also identified. Through in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the GBD database and related studies, it has been found that there is a high degree of overlap in ALS/MNDs. This discovery lays an important foundation for further research into neurological diseases, particularly the pathogenesis of ALS. In the coming period, research efforts on neurological diseases need to be strengthened further, medical resources optimized, and the increasingly heavy burden of neurological diseases effectively addressed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article and associated images are based on a poster originally authored by Sarona Jacob Anderson and presented at ELRIG Drug Discovery 2025 in affiliation with University of Salford. The information contained is for informational purposes only and should not be considered validated by independent peer assessment. The p53–MDM2 regulatory pathway is crucial for genomic integrity, with its dysregulation contributing to over half of all cancers. MDM2 overexpression suppresses p53's tumor-suppressive activity by promoting its degradation. This study aimed to identify natural product inhibitors of the p53–MDM2 interaction using computational methods. Phytochemicals from traditional medicinal plants with anticancer potential were screened using BIOVIA Discovery Studio. Lipinski and ADMET filters prioritized compounds with favourable drug-like properties. Molecular docking (CDOCKER, LibDock) identified potential binders to MDM2 (PDB: 1YCR). Binding energies were compared with clinical MDM2 inhibitors. Octanamide, n-(2- mercaptoethyl)- emerged as the top candidate, showing strong binding affinity, excellent dynamic stability, favorable predicted safety, and comparable binding energy to several clinical candidates. This study highlights Octanamide, n-(2-mercaptoethyl)- as a promising natural scaffold for developing safer p53-reactivating cancer therapeutics. Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality, often linked to the failure of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, which normally eliminates damaged cells. The p53 protein, known as the "guardian of the genome," plays a vital role by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to cellular stress, thereby maintaining genomic integrity. Dysfunction in the p53 pathway contributes to over 50 % of human cancers. MDM2 acts as a key negative regulator, binding to p53's N-terminal domain to inhibit its activity and target it for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Overexpression or amplification of MDM2 silences p53, promoting tumor progression. Therefore, inhibiting the p53-MDM2 interaction represents an effective therapeutic strategy to reactivate p53. While synthetic small-molecule MDM2 inhibitors, such as Nutlins, have shown efficacy, their clinical utility is often limited by issues including toxicity and the development of resistance. Consequently, natural products, particularly phytochemicals from medicinal plants, are being explored as alternative scaffolds due to their vast structural diversity and potentially favorable safety profiles. Integrating traditional knowledge of medicinal plants with modern computational drug discovery techniques offers a powerful approach to accelerate the identification of novel therapeutic agents. MDM2, indicated as black, binds to p53 at the N-terminal activation domain of p53, or the red area, to form p53/MDM2 complex. ALogP versus polar surface area (PSA) plot for compounds showing the 95 % and 99 % confidence. 2D diagram of Octanamide in 1YCR at the binding site. Targeting the p53-MDM2 interaction remains a key strategy in oncology, but clinical translation of synthetic inhibitors is challenged by toxicity and limited efficacy Natural products offer a vast chemical diversity for identifying novel scaffolds. Previous studies identified compounds like Lineariifolianoid A and lignans as potential MDM2 inhibitors This study employed a rigorous computational approach, combining filtering, docking, MD simulations, and toxicity prediction to screen phytochemicals from anticancer plants Octanamide, n-(2-mercaptoethyl)-, identified from Vitis vinifera, emerged as the top candidate. These findings highlight the potential of computationally screened natural products as starting points for developing safer and effective p53-reactivating therapies. This computational investigation successfully employed a multi-faceted in silico workflow to identify promising natural product-based inhibitors targeting the p53-MDM2 interaction. Among the evaluated phytochemicals, Octanamide, n-(2-mercaptoethyl)- from Vitis vinifera distinguished itself through strong predicted binding affinity, excellent stability in the MDM2 binding pocket confirmed by MD simulations, and a favorable predicted safety profile. These findings strongly support its potential as a lead candidate for restoring p53 function. This study highlights the importance of combining traditional plant-based medicine knowledge with modern computational chemistry to identify and prioritize natural compounds, such as Octanamide, n-(2-mercaptoethyl)-, for the development of safer anticancer therapeutics. Further experimental validation and structure-based optimization are warranted to advance this promising natural scaffold.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article and associated images are based on a poster originally authored by Dixon C., Haussmann I. and Maryniak L. and presented at ELRIG Drug Discovery 2025 in affiliation with Birmingham City University. It has not undergone peer review but has been reviewed to meet AZoNetwork's editorial quality standards.

In the UK EC is the 4th most common cancer and accounts for around 5 % of all new cancer cases in women. In the UK Mortality rates for EC are projected to rise by 12 % between 2025 and 2040 (2)(3). This increasing burden of EC, combined with the limitations of current treatments highlights the need for research into new treatment options that address issues with current treatment for women of all age groups such as fertility-preservation, drug resistance and recurrent/advanced cases (4)(5)(6) RSV, a polyphenol found in grape skin and seeds with properties including anti-cancer activity has demonstrated its effectiveness in enhancing the efficacy of anticancer drugs such as chloroquine (7)(8). Despite both drugs being well known for their anti-cancer properties, to our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the effects of ART and RSV in combination on Ishikawa EC cells. Given ART and RSVs individual anti-cancer effects we hypothesised that the combination of ART and RSV will significantly reduce cell viability and enhance apoptosis in Ishikawa EC cells compared the effects of each drug alone. Dose–response curve of resveratrol (0–200 μM) Ishikawa cells seeded at a density of 1 × 10⁴ cells per well in 96-well plates. Cells were treated for 72 hours, after which cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay. Each concentration was tested in triplicate across three independent experiments (n = 9 /concentration). Dose–response curve of artesunate (0–100 μM) Ishikawa cells seeded at a density of 1 × 10⁴ cells per well in 96-well plates Cell viability was determined using the MTT assay after 72 hours of treatment. Each concentration was tested in triplicate across three independent experiments (n = 9/concentration). Data represent the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. HSA, Loewe, ZIP, and Bliss synergy maps for artesunate (ART) and resveratrol (RSV) combinations (0–34.4 μM). Synergy was determined from MTT assay results in Ishikawa cells after 72 h of treatment. Green areas indicate concentrations where ART and RSV show synergy. SynergyFinder identified specific regions of high synergy at lower, untested concentrations. We established our baseline the MTT assay showed that both drugs are effective. ART is significantly more potent on its own, with an IC50 value of 7.8 μM (p=0.002), compared to RSV's IC50 of 34.4 μM. We used the IC50 values as the concentrations to conduct another MTT assay to determine whether there was a synergistic interaction between the drugs To investigate synergy, we utilised the SynergyFinder platform to analyse the interaction across four established mathematical models: Bliss, Loewe, HSA, and ZIP. The synergistic relationship between ART and RSV was consistent across all four models: the large green area in each plot confirms that ART and RSV are synergistic across a range of concentrations. Changes in cell morphology following treatment with ART 7.8 μM, RSV 34.4 μM, and both drugs in combination compared with the effects of no treatment. All treatments exhibit an antiproliferative effect on Ishikawa EC cells. Human TNF-α levels measured by ELISA at 450 nm. All samples were below the detection limit. Data represent three independent experiments; each performed in triplicate. Plots show cell size vs caspase-3/7 activity, distinguishing live, apoptotic, and dead populations. The combination treatment induced higher apoptosis than single treatments. We visually validated this synergy with microscopy. Here, we see the cell morphology after 72 hours. While individual treatments showed some effect, the combination treatment resulted in the most pronounced morphological changes including cell detachment. We hypothesised the combination works by inducing apoptosis, we assessed using flow cytometry to investigate Caspase 3/7 activity. This confirmed that all treatments induced some level of apoptosis. We also assessed if the combination had any anti-inflammatory effect by measuring TNF-α levels using an ELISA assay. Here, all samples fell below the assay's level of detection.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Preliminary results of a national survey conducted by researchers at the Simon Fraser University Faculty of Health Sciences (SFU FHS) has found that Canadians with Long COVID identified virtual healthcare services as essential to their care. "Many of the 621 survey respondents from across the country shared how lifesaving and essential these virtual services are in providing accessibility to care that reduces risk of infections, travel time, and PEM", shared FHS Research Fellow Kayli Jamieson, who also has Long COVID herself. PEM, or Post-Exertional Malaise, is common in many people with Long COVID, meaning that physical, mental, or sensory activity triggers can cause a flare-up in symptoms lasting from hours to weeks. It is one of many factors that contributes to the chronic and frequently disabling nature of Long COVID. The study, led by FHS Assistant Professor Dr. Julia Smith, aims to analyze experiences with virtual care through an intersectional lens and ultimately produce a national guidebook providing recommendations on improving virtual care access for people with Long COVID. These preliminary results suggest that virtual care is particularly helpful for people with Long COVID who face barriers accessing health services such as rural, racialized and 2SLGBTQIA+ patients. Additional recommendations include increasing availability of specialized Long COVID services in Canada-a suggestion that will require training more specialists and care providers on Long COVID management for informed, effective, and safe care. The next phases of the study will include conducting focus groups with equity-deserving populations who have Long COVID and hosting a deliberative dialogue session among patients, clinicians, and policymakers to better identify systemic solutions to address this growing gap in health care.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Millions of patients worldwide suffer from pain, numbness, and restricted movement, largely because damaged nerve fibres do not regenerate sufficiently. A research team led by Professor Dr Dietmar Fischer, Professor of Pharmacology at the University of Cologne's Faculty of Medicine, and Director of the Center for Pharmacology at University Hospital Cologne, has now identified a central mechanism that explains limited regeneration in diabetes. Building on this, the researchers have developed a promising therapeutic approach that can be used to increase regeneration. Their findings were published in the Science Translational Medicine journal under the title 'Failure of nerve regeneration in mouse models of diabetes is caused by p35-mediated CDK5 hyperactivity'. Using mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, the team demonstrated a high accumulation of the p35 protein in nerve cells. This protein activates an enzyme that triggers a signalling cascade, which in turn blocks the regrowth of nerve fibres. This considerably restricts the nerves' natural regenerative capacity. Through targeted interventions in this signalling pathway – either using genetic methods or, pharmacologically, with newly developed small protein building blocks (peptides) that can be administered systemically – the scientists succeeded in removing the block. In the preclinical models, the nerve fibres then grew again at a similar rate to that observed in healthy animals. This was accompanied by significant motor and sensory improvements. For the first time, our results show that diabetic nerve healing can be brought back to a level that compares with that of healthy animals if the excessive activation of the signalling pathway is inhibited. Even when diabetic neuropathy has already manifested, an improvement in regeneration occurs." A peptide developed and patented by his research group shows particular promise in this respect, as it targets the underlying cause directly and could, in principle, be developed into a drug. It is also worth noting that the regeneration weakness caused by diabetes occurs even before the onset of diabetic neuropathy, a common complication that affects almost half of all patients.
