                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The following contains spoilers for Supernatural #2, on sale now from Dynamite Entertainment However, that is generally more of a film situation, since there is relatively little time spent in each film, while TV shows obviously spend a lot more time each season on the characters. However, even with that extra time, there is still room for certain aspects of the show to be explored that don't get AS much attention, and one of the areas that Greg Pak has been looking in this new Supernatural series at Dynamite is to explore the practicalities of Sam and Dean Winchester being demon hunters. Namely, where do they get the money to fund their hunt? Supernatural #2 is from writer Greg Pak, artists Pasquale Qualano, Alessandro Rannadi, Vincenzo Federici, and Eder Messias, colorist Ellie Wright, and letterer Jeff Eckleberry, and it follows the "Between episodes" approach of this series (the entire series takes place between episodes towards the end of Season 1 of Supernatural) as the brother head to Las Vegas to try to win some money to help fund their hunt. Now, that sort of thing tends to work really well when you have a story split into distinctive sections, but is often a bigger issue when you just have different artists come and go in the issue. However, perhaps it is just a matter of their styles going together well or not, but for whatever reason, I really didn't mind the changes in the artists. I think they all did a good job on the storytelling, and more importantly, the character work of this issue, as this was very much a character-driven issue, and I really loved the message that we got in this issue in terms of character. Ellie Wright debuts as a colorist on this issue (it might be a one-off, who knows), and she did a fantastic job, with the glitz of Las Vegas perfectly contrasted with the darker colors of the behind-the-scenes pages when the casino owners start to freak out about Sam and Dean's ghost-aided winning streak. He has just gotten dragged back into the world of demon hunting, and he and his brother have also only recently learned that their mother's death was due to a demon (this series all takes place sometime after the 11th episode of season 1 of the show, which is when their father let them know about the demon being responsible for their mom's death). The series always made a point of showing how compassionate Sam is of other people and their problems, and this issue is bassed on that concept, as well, but, like I said, it has more meaning when he is in the middle of such a strange time in his life. How many times have you snapped at someone because they happen to get in your way when you were going through a tough time? Sam's ability to rise above that is really impressive. She uses her ghost powers to help Sam and Dean start winning at gambling. She asks them to find her earring at a pawn shop. She had likely sent other people to the pawn shop over the years, but only Sam and Dean were able to get to the earring that her killer had pawned all those years ago. "Good" comes into play, too, when Cassie tries to cut a deal with the brothers, and, of course, Sam is not interested in using her powers to make a lot of money, but it is interesting that even Dean doesn't want to do anything on a grand scale. It's a fascinating insight into the Winchesters at this point in their lives. This has been a fun series so far, and I look forward to seeing what misadventures the brothers get into next, and I particularly enjoy seeing Pak expand the Supernatural universe with characters that we could theoretically revisit in future stories, both villains and heroes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conspiracy theories have spread online about Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the man identified as the suspect in the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, and his CIA ties. Speculation has spread about Lakanwal, an Afghan national, after officials confirmed that he had once worked with the CIA, and social media users pointed to unusual Google Trends search activity. Newsweek has contacted the CIA  via the contact form on its website and Google via email on Thursday. Many Afghan nationals, like Lakanwal, worked with U.S. forces, including the CIA, while assisting American operations during the war in Afghanistan. However, the revelation of his links to the agency combined with unexplained Google search activity has sparked widespread online speculation. While there is no evidence linking his previous work to the attack, the incident highlights how gaps in public understanding of national security partnerships and data patterns can fuel misinformation. X user Louis Montoya shared a screenshot of Google Trends which appeared to show a spike in Lakanwal's name being searched in D.C. in the hours before the shooting. Another X user, James Li, noted a small amount of searches on November 20 in the D.C. area. A search on Google Trends by Newsweek did not find the search activity shared by the posters on X, but did find a small volume of searches of Lakanwal's name in the D.C. area on October 30 and November 4. Newsweek contacted Google for information about how search data is collected, and whether this could be an error or unrelated searches, for example of people with the same or similar names. Some social media users have circulated unfounded claims suggesting that these unrelated details could imply CIA involvement in Wednesday's shooting. Another X account The Patriot Voice wrote about Lakanwal's CIA links and the Google Trends data: "You NO longer have to guess if this is a FALSE FLAG operation, it is smacking us right in the face!!!" Another X user Fabian Marta wrote: "His name spiked in DC searches hours before the shooting. Lakanwal is in custody, and it remains to be seen whether more information about his past work with the CIA will be disclosed. So far, no officials have addressed the conspiracy theories circulating online. This article has been updated with an image of the suspect.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The self-proclaimed "modern-day Nostradamus", Athos Salome, is back with more Royal family predictions - this time, he's zeroing in on Meghan Markle. Athos, a 38-year-old psychic influencer known worldwide for allegedly predicting the Covid-19 pandemic, Queen Elizabeth's passing, and even Elon Musk's acquisition of X (formerly Twitter), gave an exclusive interview to the Daily Mail. The Duchess, who launched her With Love, Meghan Netflix series in March, and her lifestyle brand As Ever in 2024, has faced challenging public reactions. Her show, which features recipes and decor discussions with celebrity guests, was met with criticism upon its release. Meanwhile, stock issues with As Ever led to order cancellations and disgruntled customers. But according to Athos, Meghan's struggles are far from over. He claims to have "seen" a particularly tough remainder of the year for Meghan, including professional obstacles, public scrutiny, and bombshell revelations, reports the Express. He also mentioned in July that he foresees more "logistical setbacks" for As Ever, intense criticism, and a loss of credibility. "Meghan's image will face its harshest trial by the end of 2025. [I] foresee explosive revelations from former staff or estranged allies. However, according to Athos, this hiatus won't last too long. By the end of 2026, he anticipates Meghan will make a comeback, but with a renewed emphasis on social causes, particularly girls' education and mental health. He suggests she will then transition into a new role as a hands-on producer, stepping away from the "lifestyle aesthetic". He even goes so far as to predict that she'll return to the screen, albeit without any "no blockbusters, no red carpets". He adds: "Instead, an independent film, directed by a renowned female filmmaker - possibly European or Iranian - will mark her return to the camera". He further suggests her performance will pleasantly surprise critics and put her on the radar for major film festivals in 2027. This comes as the psychic claims the Royal Family should brace themselves for a "health issue" that will alter relationships but maintain some tension, such as the one between Harry and William, which he believes will only be resolved "in the next generation".
