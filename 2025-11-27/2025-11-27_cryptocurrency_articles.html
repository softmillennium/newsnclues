                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaking with Cointelegraph, Siu argued that altcoins collectively will outperform Bitcoin over the long term because they capture the broader economic activity happening across crypto applications. “We believe that altcoins, ultimately, over the largest space, are going to outperform Bitcoin as a collective,” he said, drawing a parallel between Bitcoin's role in crypto and gold's role in traditional markets. While gold remains a dominant store of value, Siu noted that the combined market capitalization of all public companies is “five to six times gold,” underscoring how a diverse set of growth-focused assets can surpass a single reserve asset. Siu clarified that while Bitcoin may function effectively as a reserve asset, most real industry activity—gaming, DeFi, gas fees, blockchain infrastructure, and even memecoins—occurs through altcoins. Investors in the early 2000s could back Amazon, Google, eBay, Alibaba, and dozens of other emerging platforms at formative stages. Instead, the industry will support a wide ecosystem of specialized networks and tokens—a landscape where exposure to multiple altcoins may produce better outcomes than betting on a single chain or protocol. “All of these applications are actually altcoins,” he emphasized, adding that even memecoins fall under the same umbrella as long as they power ecosystems or serve particular communities. Other strong verticals include artificial intelligence, decentralized finance, and blockchain infrastructure. Siu said the company's strategy is to build a diversified treasury of altcoins that mirrors how a technology conglomerate would accumulate early-stage stakes in internet companies. The idea is not to pick one dominant blockchain, but to invest widely enough that Animoca captures a meaningful share of future winners—whether in gaming, identity, infrastructure, tokenized experiences, or decentralized compute (DePIN). He also noted that Bitcoin's role is fundamentally different: strong as collateral and a reserve asset, but not where the majority of Web3 application development happens. “We didn't join crypto to just hold Bitcoin,” he said. “Its utility is limited for the kind of ecosystem growth we're investing in.” If Animoca succeeds with its U.S. listing, the company may become a benchmark for public-market exposure to diversified crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its altcoin-heavy strategy aligns with emerging narratives in Web3 where application-layer tokens—gaming assets, L2 governance tokens, DeFi protocols, payment networks, and digital identity systems—could outperform larger, more mature assets during the next adoption wave. Animoca's bet is that Web3 will mirror the internet era: not one dominant network, but thousands of applications with specific use cases and their own economic models. With hundreds of investments already on its balance sheet, Animoca is positioning itself to catch whichever tokens or sectors break out next. Whether the reverse merger accelerates that strategy will likely be a key storyline for crypto investors in 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has donated approximately $765,000 in ETH to two privacy messaging apps, Session and SimpleX—two apps looking to break past sector leaders Signal and Telegram. Buterin has become an increasingly vocal advocate for privacy solutions in the crypto industry, as global policies have expanded fears of global surveillance states and irked those wanting to keep their personal lives private. “Encrypted messaging, like Signal, is critical for preserving our digital privacy,” Buterin tweeted. “Two important next steps for the space are (i) permissionless account creation and (ii) metadata privacy. Session and SimpleX are two messaging apps pushing these directions forward.” Session brands itself as a decentralized “end-to-end encrypted messenger” that aims to have “minimum metadata leakage”—metadata is information that surrounds a piece of content, such as an IP address or the time it was sent. SimpleX is also a decentralized end-to-end encrypted messenger, although its focus is on users owning their “identities, contacts, and communities.” Next year, it will introduce “vouchers” that users will be required to purchase and donate to communities, such as the Bitcoin community, to host the required servers. These spaces are vulnerable to a level of surveillance that has no equivalent in the physical world," Zac Williamson, co-founder of privacy-focused Ethereum layer-2 network Aztec Network, told Decrypt. "Privacy is important so that individuals can act as free agents in their online interactions, as opposed to being digital commodities whose data is harvested, sold to the highest bidder and weaponised against the user's interests.” 'Privacy Is Hygiene,' Says Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin After Bank Data Leak</p>

Peter Schiff is once again sounding the alarm, this time warning that companies using Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) or Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) as corporate treasury strategies are ultimately doomed. What Happened: Speaking on Schwab Network, Schiff argued that Strategy's (NASDAQ:MSTR) Bitcoin-leveraged model is structurally unsound. He said the company generates no meaningful earnings, piles on losses, and survives only by issuing new debt or equity to buy more Bitcoin, an asset that yields no cash flow. At that point, the firm can no longer raise fresh capital, triggering a debt-driven unwind that forces BTC sales and potentially accelerates a broader market crash. He also claimed Bitcoin's inability to rally despite a wave of bullish catalysts, spot ETFs, a crypto-friendly president, and heavy political support, shows the market is exhausted. RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Invest Now at Just $0.85 a Share He predicts most crypto assets will ultimately go to zero, with tokenized gold emerging as the only sustainable blockchain application. Schiff concluded by saying that every corporation running a Bitcoin- or Ethereum-based treasury model will eventually end up insolvent because their business hinges entirely on speculative enthusiasm rather than a viable revenue engine.

That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry. Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies. Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hold onto your hats, because the cryptocurrency landscape is anything but stable. Recent market shifts expose a turbulent relationship with Bitcoin's value and its associated ETFs. Traditional titans, like BlackRock, feel the tremors of these upheavals, while up-and-coming players such as Solana and XRP are emerging as fascinating alternatives for optimistic investors. Once revered as the gold standard, Bitcoin now provokes caution amongst serious investors. Just recently, a staggering $255 million flowed out of Bitcoin ETFs, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust suffering a dramatic one-day withdrawal of $146 million. These incidents send shockwaves through the market, as macroeconomic fears—like unpredictable interest rates and pending regulations—loom large over even the most trusted investment pathways. This flight of capital points to a seismic shift: the unshakable belief in Bitcoin is proving fragile. Major players are cautiously reevaluating their positions, bringing into question whether Bitcoin-centric strategies can endure in this landscape of uncertainty. While Bitcoin wrestles with its own volatility, altcoin ETFs are beginning to shine. This increasing attention toward altcoins hints at a potential turning tide in the investment arena. In a single week alone, XRP attracted $221 million in net inflows, capturing the interest of investors eager for robust and reliable investments. The development of new financial instruments, such as the Vanguard Bitcoin ETF, signals that portfolio managers are adjusting their strategies, creating a more balanced investment landscape that invites diverse capital. This evolution towards alternative assets illustrates an acute recognition of the risks associated with Bitcoin's volatility. It signifies an intelligent, adaptive approach to managing assets, showcasing how both individual investors and institutions are recognizing risk management as imperative amid fluctuating market conditions. Yet, navigating this vibrant cryptocurrency ecosystem is rife with challenges. Regulatory compliance looms as a daunting barrier for many burgeoning firms in the U.S. The continuously shifting market environment presents its own set of complications, with innovative solutions often stifled by legal entanglements. This results in operational inefficiencies, leaving many to question whether decentralized finance (DeFi) could serve as a viable framework. Signs of a shift toward DeFi solutions are emerging, with their promise of smoother compatibility with existing financial infrastructures, reducing liquidity and compliance challenges. As innovation takes center stage, the future of cryptocurrency investments may hinge on successfully balancing transformative technologies with regulatory considerations. Bitcoin's tumultuous journey juxtaposes sharply against the growing enthusiasm for altcoins, as evidenced by the rising tide of investment in Solana and XRP.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kraken just made its move into the public market spotlight. Even the entertainment sector is leaning in, with online casinos adopting digital assets to enable faster payouts and global access. In that space, operators are routinely reviewed and ranked for security, licensing, and user trust, a level of scrutiny that is increasingly being applied to crypto exchanges as competition intensifies. And as more casinos experiment with provably fair systems and blockchain-based payment rails, they offer a glimpse into how digital assets can streamline user experiences across other sectors as well. Kraken was founded in 2011 and has survived many crypto winters. It has benefited from regulatory relief, especially after it transitioned to a publicly traded company, following the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) dismissing a complaint against Kraken in March 2025 regarding staking. This dismissal allowed the company to move forward with its next phase. Kraken allows users to buy/sell/trade the largest cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether, and, in Europe, it also provides tokenized equities trading, enabling European customers with another way to access equity markets. Before Trump's return to office in January, Coinbase was the only crypto exchange with publicly traded shares. Circle, the stablecoin issuer, also went public in June with a $1 billion raise. Bullish shares shot past $118 during their August IPO but have since dropped to around $35.66. Gemini's story is even rougher as its stock has fallen by more than 68% from its September debut to about $11.70, hurt by weak third-quarter results. The fact that this price drop is raising serious concerns about whether a new major cryptocurrency exchange IPO (Initial Public Offering) can proceed. According to a Kraken release, the public offering will be made by Kraken only after we receive a response from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding our registration statement, provided that market conditions are favorable. As mentioned above, the latter point makes more sense than one may think. Although the broader IPO market is improving in terms of volume in 2025, historically, we've seen crypto equities to be very volatile, regardless of how well a business is doing financially. Kraken's filing represents more than just another company going public. When major players like Citadel Securities write nine-figure checks for crypto platforms, it signals that digital assets have moved well past their fringe status. The question now is whether public market investors will see Kraken differently than they've treated Gemini and Bullish. The exchange has size and history on its side, plus that fresh $20 billion valuation backed by serious institutional money. But recent track records suggest the market isn't just handing out wins to crypto companies with good stories anymore.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>IntelliQuant CEO Lee Jong‑kwon officially introduced LUMINT, a decentralized distributed reward system, during his keynote address at the “AI & Blockchain Conference” held in Cheongju, Chungcheongbuk-do. To address these issues, Lumint was designed with a “hybrid structure” that preserves strengths while improving weaknesses. For example, instead of a simple ICO during fundraising, Lumint uses a node-purchase model to prevent early investors from leaving after quick profits; staking ensures rewards over 900 days. Another distinguishing feature is that, rather than enforcing a strict lock-up period, the structure allows users to start earning profit immediately after staking. Additionally, funds gathered through staking are connected to AI-based investment services to generate additional financial returns, and a “smart mining” system that automatically adjusts mining output is applied. The Lumint Node Staking Framework (LNSF) is characterized by: node-based coin distribution, performance-based incentives, an automatic adjustment mechanism, and an initial 100% node-based allocation system. System development is also being pursued on a Web3 foundation with additional features: “Web3 first,” dynamic translation system to support global service, minimal maintenance points for rapid scaling, deterministic algorithm-based fair rewards, and UX built on Next.js. Lee added that Lumint embodies four values: transparency, scalability, accessibility, and fairness. A hybrid platform combining Web3 technology with Web2-friendly usability is under development. Lee said the plan is to manage funds by diversifying and controlling risk using four foundations: portfolio management, quantitative trading, professional staff, and platform technology. In addition, Lumint was recently selected as a broker partner by global exchange OKX — laying the groundwork for overseas market expansion. IntelliQuant is a blockchain infrastructure company that develops AI-powered node management solutions through its platform Lumint. The company's hybrid staking model combines artificial intelligence with decentralized infrastructure to provide automated node operations for institutional and retail participants across multiple blockchain networks.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the Department of Defense accelerates its push toward autonomous systems, a critical vulnerability has emerged: the inability to verify that an AI model deployed on a drone or missile system hasn't been tampered with by adversaries. Addressing this trust deficit, Raytheon, a titan of the defense industrial base, has formally integrated cryptographic startup Lagrange into its vendor network. The move signals a pivotal shift in how defense primes approach software procurement, moving beyond perimeter security to intrinsic algorithmic verification. The integration centers on Lagrange's proprietary “DeepProve” technology, a system rooted in Zero-Knowledge (ZK) cryptography—a field previously dominated by blockchain privacy applications. This partnership positions Lagrange to capture a slice of the estimated $30 billion currently allocated for U.S. military AI contracts, a figure that reflects the Pentagon's aggressive pivot toward software-defined warfare under initiatives like the Replicator program. Cryptographic Certainty in Kinetic Warfare The core of this collaboration addresses the “black box” dilemma inherent in deep learning models. Unlike traditional code, which follows explicit logic, modern AI operates on probabilistic weights derived from vast datasets. If an adversary were to “poison” this training data or subtly alter the model's weights during transmission to a tactical edge device, the consequences could be catastrophic—ranging from fratricide to the failure of critical intelligence gathering. According to Lagrange's announcement, their DeepProve technology ensures tamper-resistant intelligence, effectively creating a digital fingerprint for AI models that proves their integrity without revealing the underlying proprietary algorithms or classified data. Industry observers note that Raytheon's decision to onboard a cryptographic specialist underscores a broader anxiety within the defense sector regarding supply chain security. As reported by Defense News, the Department of Defense has increasingly scrutinized the software bill of materials (SBOM) for all vendors. However, Lagrange offers something distinct: mathematical proof of execution. By utilizing Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), Raytheon can theoretically verify that a specific output—such as a target identification—was generated by a specific, authorized model version, ensuring that the system has not been hijacked by electronic warfare tactics or cyber-intrusion. With the U.S. military's AI budget swelling to encompass everything from predictive maintenance to autonomous wingmen, the market for “AI assurance” is rapidly expanding. The Raytheon-Lagrange integration represents a successful bridging of this divide, allowing a legacy prime contractor to leverage agile, cutting-edge cryptography to meet the rigorous compliance standards of the DoD's Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC). As new entrants like Anduril and Palantir challenge the dominance of traditional defense contractors, the incumbents are under pressure to demonstrate that their hardware is not just kinetic, but intelligent and secure. By integrating DeepProve, Raytheon effectively insures its AI products against the growing threat of adversarial machine learning. This capability is likely to become a standard requirement in future procurement cycles, where the provenance of an algorithm will be scrutinized as heavily as the physical components of a munition. In these scenarios, verifying the integrity of a command is difficult. Lagrange's technology allows for “lightweight” proofs that can be verified on hardware with limited processing power. Furthermore, this integration speaks to the rising threat of “data poisoning,” where adversaries subtly manipulate training data to create backdoors in AI models. DeepProve's architecture mitigates this by creating a cryptographic chain of custody for the model's evolution. From Blockchain to Battlefield The trajectory of Lagrange from a cryptographic startup, likely rooted in the decentralized finance or Web3 sector, to a Raytheon vendor illustrates the increasing dual-use nature of privacy-preserving technologies. Zero-Knowledge proofs were originally popularized to scale blockchains like Ethereum. This “need-to-know” architecture is central to the Pentagon's Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) strategy. As disparate systems from the Air Force, Navy, and Army attempt to share data in real-time, the attack surface expands exponentially. Bloomberg Government analysis suggests that the next generation of defense contracts will favor vendors who can demonstrate “Zero Trust” architectures not just in network access, but in computational integrity. Lagrange's entry into the Raytheon ecosystem is a bellwether for this trend, suggesting that the future of defense contracting will require deep cryptographic competency. As the U.S. government moves toward regulating AI safety, defense agencies must ensure their autonomous systems adhere to the Laws of Armed Conflict. Lagrange's technology facilitates this by generating verifiable proofs of the computation process. If a drone strikes a target, commanders can mathematically prove that the system was executing valid, authorized code at the moment of engagement, offering a layer of legal and ethical cover that is currently missing in black-box AI systems. This capability serves as a significant differentiator for Raytheon in competitive bidding processes. While other contractors may offer higher performance or lower costs, the ability to offer “provable security” creates a moat around their offerings. The $30 billion market opportunity is not just about building better AI, but about building AI that the Pentagon can trust implicitly. Historically, companies like Raytheon would attempt to build such capabilities in-house, a process that is often slow and costly. This mirrors the commercial tech sector's approach, where giants like Microsoft or Google acquire or partner with specialized security firms to bolster their cloud offerings. This shift is likely to spur further M&A activity and partnerships within the defense technology space. Startups specializing in homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, and other privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) are now viewing the Department of Defense not as a bureaucratic labyrinth, but as a viable, high-revenue customer. As TechCrunch has noted in its defense tech coverage, the “valley of death”—the gap between a pilot program and a program of record—is being bridged by these strategic partnerships with prime contractors who already hold the keys to the kingdom. As adversaries develop more sophisticated methods to spoof, jam, and subvert autonomous systems, the layer of protection provided by cryptographic proofs will transition from a luxury to a necessity. The $30 billion earmarked for AI contracts is likely just the beginning, with a significant portion of future funding diverted specifically toward AI assurance and security.

While other contractors may offer higher performance or lower costs, the ability to offer “provable security” creates a moat around their offerings. The $30 billion market opportunity is not just about building better AI, but about building AI that the Pentagon can trust implicitly. Historically, companies like Raytheon would attempt to build such capabilities in-house, a process that is often slow and costly. This mirrors the commercial tech sector's approach, where giants like Microsoft or Google acquire or partner with specialized security firms to bolster their cloud offerings. This shift is likely to spur further M&A activity and partnerships within the defense technology space. Startups specializing in homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, and other privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) are now viewing the Department of Defense not as a bureaucratic labyrinth, but as a viable, high-revenue customer. As TechCrunch has noted in its defense tech coverage, the “valley of death”—the gap between a pilot program and a program of record—is being bridged by these strategic partnerships with prime contractors who already hold the keys to the kingdom. As adversaries develop more sophisticated methods to spoof, jam, and subvert autonomous systems, the layer of protection provided by cryptographic proofs will transition from a luxury to a necessity. The $30 billion earmarked for AI contracts is likely just the beginning, with a significant portion of future funding diverted specifically toward AI assurance and security. With the U.S. military's AI budget swelling to encompass everything from predictive maintenance to autonomous wingmen, the market for “AI assurance” is rapidly expanding. The Raytheon-Lagrange integration represents a successful bridging of this divide, allowing a legacy prime contractor to leverage agile, cutting-edge cryptography to meet the rigorous compliance standards of the DoD's Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC). As new entrants like Anduril and Palantir challenge the dominance of traditional defense contractors, the incumbents are under pressure to demonstrate that their hardware is not just kinetic, but intelligent and secure. By integrating DeepProve, Raytheon effectively insures its AI products against the growing threat of adversarial machine learning. This capability is likely to become a standard requirement in future procurement cycles, where the provenance of an algorithm will be scrutinized as heavily as the physical components of a munition. In these scenarios, verifying the integrity of a command is difficult. Lagrange's technology allows for “lightweight” proofs that can be verified on hardware with limited processing power. Furthermore, this integration speaks to the rising threat of “data poisoning,” where adversaries subtly manipulate training data to create backdoors in AI models. DeepProve's architecture mitigates this by creating a cryptographic chain of custody for the model's evolution. Zero-Knowledge proofs were originally popularized to scale blockchains like Ethereum. This “need-to-know” architecture is central to the Pentagon's Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) strategy. As disparate systems from the Air Force, Navy, and Army attempt to share data in real-time, the attack surface expands exponentially. Bloomberg Government analysis suggests that the next generation of defense contracts will favor vendors who can demonstrate “Zero Trust” architectures not just in network access, but in computational integrity. Lagrange's entry into the Raytheon ecosystem is a bellwether for this trend, suggesting that the future of defense contracting will require deep cryptographic competency. As the U.S. government moves toward regulating AI safety, defense agencies must ensure their autonomous systems adhere to the Laws of Armed Conflict.

But according to Ethereum and Polkadot co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood, Buterin's original document required significant work before the blockchain design could be implemented. When Buterin first published the Ethereum White Paper online  in early 2014, he was just 19 years old, and crypto was still characterized by a small community of Bitcoin enthusiasts. The platform's original co-founders assembled more or less organically, with Wood joining specifically to help formalize Buterin's idea. As he explained in an interview published on Wednesday, Nov. 26, the white paper was more of a “vision document.” While Buterin conceived the vision for Ethereum and sketched its general outline, Wood's yellow paper provided the precise, mathematical details required for developers to build independent client implementations. More than a decade after Ethereum launched, Wood and other co-founders have parted ways, leaving Buterin as its leading figurehead. But although they attempted to learn from Ethereum's early challenges to build more scalable blockchain networks, neither has ever surpassed the original smart contract platform in terms of adoption. Despite technical advances, no Ethereum-killers ever materialized, and today, Buterin's vision document is considered a seminal piece of crypto history.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, has radically changed his stance towards the crypto industry: after years of skepticism, he now validates blockchain technology and stablecoins as essential tools for banking efficiency and profitability. Those who have followed the market in recent years will have heard Dimon say that he didn't give a damn about Bitcoin and that if anyone was foolish enough to buy it, they would eventually pay the price. Although he remains a critic of Bitcoin, in his speech, the banker emphasized that Cryptographic technology is real and, above all, useful.This shift in narrative is significant coming from Dimon. While in 2017 his comments lumped the entire ecosystem together under a single label of risk, in 2025 his analysis is much more granular. Dimon has begun to clearly differentiate between the volatility of decentralized cryptocurrencies and the operational utility of blockchain technology and stablecoins. His recognition It focuses on the ability of these tools to solve historical banking problems, such as the speed of cross-border transactions and asset settlement. For industry experts, this distinction is fundamental to understanding the bank's current strategy. By calling blockchain technology "real," Dimon validates what many in the industry already consider: Blockchain offers significant advantages over traditional accounting systemsThis recognition does not represent an ideological surrender to Bitcoin's decentralized philosophy, but rather a practical acceptance that this technology can optimize how financial value moves and is managed today. The central argument for this new phase of JPMorgan is practical applicability. Dimon specifically highlighted the role of JPM CoinThe digital currency developed by the bank itself serves as a tangible example of this utility. Unlike public cryptocurrencies, whose value fluctuates based on market supply and demand, tools like JPM Coin and smart contracts are designed to execute specific functions with mathematical precision. The executive noted that these instruments are vital for asset transfers and improving profitability in trading, areas where traditional banking often faces friction due to intermediaries and waiting times. The smart contractsThese self-executing codes, also mentioned by Dimon in his presentation, represent a significant advance in the automation of financial processes. Thus, Dimon's discourse moves away from the ideological debate surrounding cryptocurrencies and focuses on tangible business results. For an institution the size of JPMorgan, incorporating blockchain is not an ideological stance, but a clear strategy to optimize its balance sheets and profitability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Bank is testing custom stablecoin issuance on the Stellar blockchain network. “It's another way to move money on a blockchain, and we look at blockchain as an alternative payment rail, and we're very interested to see what use cases are going to manifest from that and what customers are most interested in,” Mike Villano, senior vice president, head of digital asset products at U.S. Bank, said in a video included with the post. “So we are very honored to have the confidence of U.S. Bank and our partners at PwC.” U.S. Bancorp CEO Gunjan Kedia said in October that the bank was looking to pilot stablecoin transactions this year through partnerships. When it comes to stablecoins as a payment rail, the bank's efforts are twofold, Kedia said. “One is to just be ready to onboard and offboard a stablecoin into the banking system, and we are working on that in conjunction with the industry consortiums,” Kedia said Oct. 16 during an earnings call. “And then the second is just being ready to provide stablecoin services as a payment vehicle should that market take off within our client base.” A day earlier, on Oct. 15, U.S. Bank announced that it had established an organization that will focus on emerging digital products and services like stablecoin issuance, cryptocurrency custody, asset tokenization and digital money movement.
