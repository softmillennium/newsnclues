                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Jefferies' relationship into bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands Group, The Financial Times reported Thursday. The newspaper, citing people with knowledge of the matter, said the regulator is looking into whether Jefferies gave investors enough information on its Point Bonita fund's exposure to the failed auto business. It's not clear whether it will result in any allegations of wrongdoing. Jefferies came under pressure last month after its exposure to First Brands — which collapsed under a series of complex debt agreements — raised fears of other bad loans on Wall Street. When asked for comment, an SEC spokesperson said the agency "does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation." Jefferies did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The best Disney Plus and Hulu Black Friday deals in 2025 can help you save on some of the streaming service's most popular bundles. From now through Cyber Monday, new and eligible returning subscribers can get their first 12 months of service for just $4.99 a month. There are a few other Disney Plus bundle deals that are can't-miss, including the ad-free Disney Plus and Hulu bundle, which discounts the bundle price down from $19.99 a month to $14.99 a month for 12 months. There's a huge double-saving on these two bundled popular ad-supported streaming platforms. The plan offers all content from both Hulu and Disney Plus at a fraction of what it would cost to pay for them separately. If you're looking for something a little more sports-friendly, you might be interested in one of the Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Unlimited bundle deals. The ad-supported Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Unlimited deal typically costs $35.99 a month, but the current deal knocks it down to $29.99 a month for 12 months, which shakes out to 17% off. The premium Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Unlimited (ad-free Disney Plus and Hulu, plus ESPN Unlimited, which features ad-supported live streams) usually costs $44.99 a month, but the deal brings it down to $38.99 a month (13% off) for 12 months. These special offers run until January, so customers have a little bit more time to cash in on them beyond Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This bundle combines ad-supported Disney Plus and Hulu with ESPN Unlimited, pulling together three massive libraries for one discounted price. The Premium tier of this bundle combines ESPN Unlimited with ad-free Disney Plus and Hulu. This plan also unlocks the ability to download content. Keep reading to learn everything you need to know about the Disney Plus and Hulu deals, including specific end dates and eligibility requirements. For even more deals, check out all of our early Black Friday coverage across top categories. The Black Friday Disney Plus and Hulu bundle deals will run through December 1, 2025. As we mentioned above, the Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Unlimited bundle deals are expected to stick around until January 5, 2026. Current Disney Plus, ESPN, Hulu, and bundle subscribers are not eligible for the Disney Plus and Hulu bundle offers. If you got the Disney Plus Black Friday promotional deal last year, you'll be able to sign up for the deal again this year as long as your subscription ended before November 25, 2025, and has been fully canceled. There are several other bundles in addition to the four deals we've highlighted today, which you can read about in our Disney Plus bundles guide. Additionally, there are bundles for Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Select, which are cheaper than the ESPN Unlimited bundles and offer a pared-down sports streaming experience. While these bundles aren't a part of the limited-time Black Friday deals, we still think they're worth checking out. We already consider the Disney Plus bundles to be stellar offers (even without a special limited-time deal), since they offer such significant savings each month compared to subscribing to two or three services separately. For more bundles and eligibility information, you can explore these deals directly through the Disney Plus website. Check out the rest of our Black Friday coverage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin has broken his silence on a U.S.-backed peace plan to end the war in Ukraine, saying Moscow is ready for "serious" discussions about the draft proposals. "In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements," Putin said in comments made during a trip to Kyrgyzstan and translated by Reuters. The president added that the U.S. appeared to be taking Russia's position on a peace settlement "into account" and that Moscow was ready for "serious discussions" when U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff travels to Moscow next week for talks. Those talks came after reports last week of a U.S.-Russia devised 28-point peace plan, which appeared to heavily favor Russia's demands. Ukraine and its European allies' scrambled to mount a response, amending the plan and inserting counter proposals which were discussed in Geneva last weekend with a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The current draft plan, which has reportedly been slimmed down to 19 key proposals, appears to have received Ukraine's tentative backing, putting the ball back in Russia's court as to whether it could accept the framework to build upon. On Wednesday, Putin's close aide Yuri Ushakov had claimed that Russia had not even seen an official version of the latest U.S.-backed draft deal for Ukraine, but that it had seen an unofficial version. Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said Moscow welcomed U.S. efforts on peace proposals but said "there are no concessions on key issues on the Ukraine settlement," suggesting there could be some distance to travel before a deal is actually reached. On Thursday, Putin praised Russian advances in Ukraine and told reporters that the fighting in Ukraine would stops once Ukrainian troops withdraw from their positions in key areas. If they did not do so, then Russian forces will achieve their objectives by force, he added. Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov warned on Wednesday against jumping to conclusions regarding an end to the war, which Russia launched when it invaded Ukraine in Feb. 2022. It's too early to say that," Peskov told reporters, state news agency TASS reported, when asked whether this was the closest Russia and Ukraine had ever been to concluding a peace agreement. CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for further comment and is awaiting a response. Multiple outlets reported Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation that had held talks with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday appeared to tentatively support the basis of a U.S.-backed peace plan — though key details remained unresolved. ABC News and CBS News both reported an unnamed U.S. official had said that the Ukrainians "have agreed" to the deal, while adding there were still points that had to be ironed out. It was unclear if both stories quoted the same U.S. official. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said later Tuesday that Kyiv was ready to advance the peace framework, Reuters reported, citing a copy of a speech the president gave to a coalition of allied countries. U.S. President Donald Trump said at the White House on Tuesday, "I think we're getting very close to a deal. In a Truth Social post later Tuesday afternoon, Trump said, "there are only a few remaining points of disagreement." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple has filed a case in the Delhi High Court against the country's antitrust body because of how it considers global turnover when calculating penalties. The iPhone maker, which is among the fastest-growing smartphone brands in India, is challenging India's new antitrust law under which the U.S. company could face fines of up to $38 billion, according to a report by Reuters. Apple added that it was "unconstitutional, grossly disproportionate, unjust" for the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to use turnover when calculating penalties. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC. The CCI has been investigating complaints from an alliance of Indian startups and Tinder-owner Match Group that accuse Apple of "abusive conduct," which forces developers to pay high commissions for in-app purchases. The CCI's final verdict is still pending, but it said its "prima facie view [is] that mandatory use of Apple's IAP for paid apps and in-app purchases restricts the choice available to the app developers to select a payment processing system of their choice," in an order in December 2021. Apple recorded its highest-ever quarterly shipments in India of 5 million units in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from IDC. The company is expected to sell about 15 million iPhones in India this year and could rank among the top five smartphone companies there, Navkendar Singh, associate vice president with IDC India,  on Nov. 18. Apple is among the global companies diversifying their manufacturing supply chains away from China to India. In 2024, Apple's exports from India hit a record of $12.8 billion, up more than 42% from a year earlier. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Puma shares finished 18.9% higher on Thursday following a report that China's Anta Sports is among a number of firms looking to buy the struggling German athletic brand. Puma is in the middle of what is calls a "reset," as sales growth has dramatically dropped after a revenue bump during Covid-19. Earlier this month, shares hit their lowest level in more than 10 years, while year-to-date losses amount to more than 50% amid an increasingly competitive sportswear market and tariffs hitting customer sentiment. Hong Kong-listed Anta Sports is said to weigh a potential bid for the sportswear maker, the outlet reported. For Anta, acquiring Puma could be a gateway to the Western world, said Metzler analyst Felix Dennl, noting the Chinese company's strong track record in turning around underperforming assets. "On the one hand, Anta already has broad-based international market exposure via its stake in Amer Group, hence the additional value add from Puma is expected to add to the portfolio is not completely clear," he added. Puma may also attract interest from Chinese apparel firm Li Ning and Japan's Asics Corp, the Bloomberg report said. "As of now, the company has not engaged in any substantive negotiations or evaluations regarding the transaction mentioned in the news," Li Ning said in an emailed statement. Asics didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Puma's Frankfurt-listed shares were up 13.7% by 12:30 p.m. London time (7:30 a.m. Puma CEO Arthur Hoeld, who was appointed on July 1, is tasked with reviving the ailing brand. His turnaround plan involves cutting jobs, narrowing its product range, and improving marketing operations. "At the end of July, we stated that 2025 would be a year of reset," Hoeld said in a statement on Oct. 30. "Since then, we have taken important steps to clean up PUMA's distribution, improve our cash management and reset our operational expenses. By expanding our cost efficiency programme, we are moving quickly to address challenges and make the business more efficient and resilient." The company also said it is aiming to establish itself as a "Top 3 global sports brand," as it reported quarterly sales that fell on a double digit basis. Puma acknowledged that key challenges included a muted brand momentum, U.S. tariffs, and high inventory levels. It also said it expects to post an operating profit loss in 2025 — a huge swing from the previously expected profit of between 445 million euros ($516 million) and 525 million euros — due to the impact of tariffs. Puma's biggest shareholder is currently Artemis which holds a 29% stake in the company. Artemis — the holding company of France's billionaire Pinault family as well as the largest shareholder of Gucci-owner Kering — has been on a spending spree and has seen its debt balloon. Artemis' valuation expectations for Puma may be a major hurdle to any transaction involving the athletic brand, Bloomberg reported.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This report is from this week's CNBC's "Inside India" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse. India lives in contradictions — think landing a spacecraft on moon but not getting basic infrastructure right, or being the world's fastest growing economy that has millions struggling to make ends meet. The country's labor market is yet another area emblematic of that paradox. While big businesses have bemoaned rigid labor market laws in the country, several startups have fast become unicorns, making use of the flexibility that came with employing vast armies of gig workers, many of whom have no employment protection or social welfare. Last Friday, when the Indian government announced labor reforms, consolidating 29 separate labor laws into four comprehensive codes, it attempted to address these incongruities — balancing business interests with employee welfare. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a post on X hailed the measures, saying the new codes "will build a future-ready ecosystem that protects the rights of workers and strengthens India's economic growth." The reform is important for India as it addresses the problem of labor rigidity due to which "firms find it expensive to grow," unable to benefit from economies of scale, HSBC said in a note on Wednesday. To achieve that target, it needs to ramp up industrial production and attract investments from local and foreign companies. The country's complex web of labor laws have been a key hurdle to realizing those goals. But for that to happen, companies need to see policy reforms including easing of "rigid labor laws," Rossow said. "The compliance leap from informal to formal will now be easier, as the ease of maintaining registers and filling forms reduces the tyranny of a corrupt and rent-seeking bureaucracy." Under the new policy, gig workers will gain access to social security benefits, and startups will be required to allocate up to 2% of their turnover toward building a social security net for these workers. Additionally, fixed term or contract employees will now qualify for benefits available to permanent workers, including leave, medical, and social security. On Wednesday, trade unions backed by opposition political parties organized sporadic protest across the country, calling for a roll back of the reforms. India's Ministry of Labor and Employment did not respond to CNBC's request for comments. "While the codes aim to create a unified national framework, states retain the power to frame many operational rules," said Preeti Sharma, partner, global employer services at business advisory firm BDO India. "Given the competitive investment climate, some divergences are possible especially around threshold and local procedural requirements," she added. Each state could implement the code differently and it "may be an initial headache for employers" but that is likely to be a transitory issue, said Arjun Paleri, partner at Mumbai-based law firm BTG Advaya. Both state and central governments can draft labor rules in India. The labor reforms are also expected to lead to higher operational costs for companies that rely on fixed term employees such as those in the manufacturing or construction sectors, as well as for firms that employ gig workers. Over the last few years, India has seen a steep rise in the number of startups that employ gig workers for food and goods delivery, quick commerce, personal concierge and home services. "The e-commerce industries are going to get impacted heavily with much higher running costs given formal recognition of gig workers and platform workers," said Gerald Manoharan, partner at legal firm JSA. Social benefits and contribution to welfare funds by aggregators are bound to affect the operating margin of such companies, before the costs are passed on to the customers, he added. Big aggregators such as Zomato, Swiggy and Amazon, however, have "welcomed" the reforms, saying that they are evaluating the changes. Under the new labor codes, fixed-term employees will be eligible to receive benefits equal to permanent workers, including leave, medical, and social security, potentially raising costs for manufacturing, infrastructure and real estate companies that employ a higher share of fixed-term or contract employees. "Labour cost already makes up close to 25%-30% of our overall project cost," said Sujay Kalele, founder and CEO of Mumbai-based real estate firm Tru Realty, adding that his firm is expecting baseline labor cost to increase by 5%-10% over the next 18 months. However, he said that updated provisions around workforce flexibility, smoother exit thresholds and longer shift options of 8-12 hours, could partly offset the cost escalation through productivity gains. Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst at Kpler, said that Indian refiners will be adjusting their purchases of Russian oil rather than stopping them entirely. Tan Teck Leng, UBS Global Wealth Management's executive director and APAC FX and macro strategist, said that his base case is for the Reserve Bank of India to cut rates one more time. Aditya Suresh, Macquarie Capital's head of India equity research, expects the country's quick-commerce companies to suffer to losses for "several years," beyond the one-year horizon that other analysts expect. India's $33 billion defense production ambition is on track. Despite the recent crash of the India-made Tejas fighter jet at an airshow in Dubai, investors are bullish on New Delhi's defense ambitions as the country seeks to double its military production to 3 trillion rupees (about $33 billion) by 2029. Global companies want to list their India units. Global companies are rushing to list their local business units in one of the world's busiest IPO markets. Apple is contesting India's new antitrust penalty law. We have more than 20 exporters coming to our office, because they are losing orders from Europe and America over the last couple of months. Both the indexes had last hit record highs in September 2024. The country's benchmark 10-year bond yield was up 1 basis point at 6.503% on Thursday, having declined over 7 basis points in the first three days of this week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A huge fire still burning in a Hong Kong apartment complex that has killed at least 55 people and left nearly 300 missing may have been caused by a "grossly negligent" construction firm using unsafe materials, police said on Thursday. Almost a full day after the fire began, firefighters were struggling to reach residents potentially trapped on the upper floors of the Wang Fuk Court housing complex due to intense heat and thick smoke from the blaze that erupted on Wednesday afternoon. The tightly packed complex in the northern Tai Po district has 2,000 apartments in eight blocks that are home to more than 4,600 people in a city struggling with chronic shortages of affordable housing. "We bought in this building more than 20 years ago. All of our belongings were in this building, and now that it has all burned like this, what's left? asked a 51-year-old resident with the surname Wan. "She and her father are still not out yet. They didn't have water to save our building," she sobbed, carrying her daughter's graduation photo. Video from the scene showed flames leaping from at least two of the 32-storey towers sheathed in green construction mesh and bamboo scaffolding. The fire was still burning on Thursday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it started. Authorities said they had brought the blaze in four of seven blocks under control, with operations continuing in three. Bamboo scaffolding is a mainstay of traditional Chinese architecture but has been subject to a phase-out in Hong Kong since March for safety reasons. Police officers searched the housing estate's building maintenance company on Thursday morning, seizing documents that mention Wang Fuk Court, local media reported. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "We have reason to believe that the company's responsible parties were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties," said Eileen Chung, a Hong Kong police superintendent. Three men from the construction company, two directors and one engineering consultant, had been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter over the fire, she added. Police said in addition to the buildings being covered with protective mesh sheets and plastic that may not meet fire standards, they discovered some windows on one unaffected building were sealed with a foam material, installed by a construction company carrying out year-long maintenance work. A firefighter was among the 55 killed with dozens in hospital in critical condition, Hong Kong authorities said on Thursday afternoon. Chung said 900 residents were spread across eight shelters. Indonesia's foreign ministry said on Thursday that two Indonesian migrant workers "in the domestic sector" died in the fire and two others were injured. The death toll is now the highest in a Hong Kong fire since 1948, when 176 people were killed in a warehouse blaze. The third is to support and recover. Harry Cheung, 66, who has lived at Block Two in one of the complexes for more than 40 years, said he heard a loud noise at about 2:45 p.m. (0645 GMT) and saw fire erupt in a nearby block. "I immediately went back to pack up my things," he said. Another long-time resident, a woman surnamed Chu, said she still had not been able to contact her friends who live in the next block. After staying over at a friend's place on Wednesday night, the 70-year-old came back to see her home still burning. An online app showed missing persons reports submitted through a linked Google document that detailed residents of individual towers and rooms. It includes descriptions like "Mother-in-law in her 70s, missing" or "one boy and one girl" or "Rooftop: 33-year-old male." One description simply says "27th floor, room 1: He is dead." "Our hearts go out to all those affected by the horrific fire in Hong Kong," the Grenfell United survivors' group said on social media. "To the families, friends and communities, we stand with you. Many residents took to social media to criticise what they saw as negligence and cost-cutting as a cause of the fire. From the mainland, China's President Xi Jinping urged an "all-out effort" to extinguish the fire and to minimise casualties and losses, China's state broadcaster CCTV said. Hong Kong's Transport Department said that a number of roads would remain closed in the area on Thursday morning and 39 bus routes have been diverted, while nearby schools have been closed. Hong Kong's sky-high property prices have long been a trigger for social discontent in the city and the fire tragedy could further stoke resentment towards authorities ahead of a city-wide legislative election in early December. Wang Fuk Court is one of many high-rise housing complexes in Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Tai Po, located near the border with mainland China, is an established suburban district with some 300,000 residents. According to online posts, it has been undergoing renovations for a year at a cost of HK$330 million ($42.43 million), with each unit paying between HK$160,000 and HK$180,000.
