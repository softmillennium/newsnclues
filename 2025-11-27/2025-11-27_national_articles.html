WASHINGTON (AP) — The brazen daytime shooting of two National Guard members in the nation's capital by a man authorities identified as an Afghan national has raised multiple questions. The Guard members, who have been identified as Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, were hospitalized in critical condition after Wednesday's shooting. They belong to the West Virginia National Guard, which deployed hundreds of troops to the nation's capital as part of President Donald Trump's crime-fighting mission that involved taking over the local police department. There were nearly 2,200 Guard members in D.C. for the mission. Patrick Morrisey initially posted on social media that two of his state's Guard members were killed. He later walked that back, saying his office was “receiving conflicting reports” about their condition. At least one Guard member exchanged gunfire with the shooter, a law enforcement official said. Authorities believe he was the only gunman. Carroll said that it was not clear whether one of the Guard members or a law enforcement officer shot the suspect and that investigators so far had no information on a motive. Lakanwal, 29, entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden administration program that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from the country, officials said. The initiative brought roughly 76,000 people to the U.S., many of whom had worked alongside U.S. troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators. The program has drawn intense criticism from President Donald Trump and other Republicans over what they have argued are gaps in the vetting process and the speed of admissions. Supporters have said the initiative has offered a lifeline to people at risk of Taliban reprisals. Ratcliffe did not specify what work Lakanwal did, but said the relationship “ended shortly following the chaotic evacuation” of U.S. servicemembers from Afghanistan. A resident of the eastern Afghan province of Khost who identified himself as Lakanwal's cousin said Lakanwal was originally from the province. The cousin, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said Lakanwal had worked in a special Afghan Army unit known as Zero Units. Zero Units were paramilitary units manned by Afghans but backed by the CIA and also served in front-line fighting with CIA paramilitary officers. The cousin said Lakanwal started out working as a security guard for the unit in 2012, and was later promoted to become a team leader and a GPS specialist. Lakanwal's former landlord, Kristina Widman, said Lakanwal had been living in Washington state with his wife and five children, according to his former landlord, Kristina Widman. “We are praying that they survive and that the highest charge will not have to be murder in the first degree. But make no mistake, if they do not, that will certainly be the charge,” she said. Pirro said that “it's too soon to say” what the suspect's motives were. Soon after the shooting, Trump said he would send 500 more National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. It's not clear where the additional troops would come from. In addition to West Virginia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama also had forces in the capital early this month. A federal judge last week ordered an end to the Guard deployment but also put her order on hold for 21 days to allow the Trump administration time to either remove the troops or appeal.

WASHINGTON (AP) — An Afghan national who worked with the CIA in his native country and immigrated to the U.S. in 2021 drove from Washington state to shoot two West Virginia National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C., just blocks from the White House, U.S. officials said Thursday. The suspect had worked in a special CIA-backed Afghan Army unit before emigrating from Afghanistan, according to a cousin who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. Pirro identified the guard members at a news conference as Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt. Pirro said that the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, launched an “ambush-style” attack with a .357 Smith & Wesson revolver. Pirro said that “it's too soon to say” what the suspect's motives were. The charges could be upgraded, Pirro said, adding, “We are praying that they survive and that the highest charge will not have to be murder in the first degree. But make no mistake, if they do not, that will certainly be the charge.” The rare shooting of National Guard members on American soil, on the day before Thanksgiving, comes amid court fights and a broader public policy debate about the Trump administration's use of the military to combat what officials cast as an out-of-control crime problem. The Trump administration quickly ordered 500 more National Guard members to Washington. The suspect who was in custody also was shot and had wounds that were not believed to be life-threatening, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. A resident of the eastern Afghan province of Khost who identified himself as Lakanwal's cousin said Lakanwal was originally from the province and that he and his brother had worked in a special Afghan Army unit known as Zero Unit in the southern province of Kandahar. Zero Units were paramilitary units manned by Afghans but backed by the CIA and also served in front-line fighting with CIA paramilitary officers. Lakanwal, 29, entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden administration program that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the U.S. withdrawal from the country, officials said. The initiative brought roughly 76,000 people to the U.S., many of whom had worked alongside U.S. troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators. It has since faced intense scrutiny from Trump and his allies, congressional Republicans and some government watchdogs over allegations of gaps in the vetting process and the speed of admissions, even as advocates say it offered a lifeline to people at risk of Taliban reprisals. Lakanwal has been living in Bellingham, Washington, about 79 miles (127 kilometers) north of Seattle, with his wife and five children, said his former landlord, Kristina Widman. He did not specify what work Lakanwal did, but said the relationship “ended shortly following the chaotic evacuation” of U.S. servicemembers from Afghanistan. The CIA relied on Afghan staff for translation, administrative and front-line fighting with their own paramilitary officers in the war. Wednesday night, in a video message released on social media, President Donald Trump called for the reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees who entered under the Biden administration. “If they can't love our country, we don't want them,” he said, adding that the shooting was “a crime against our entire nation.” FBI Director Kash Patel said the shooting is being investigated as an act of terrorism. Pirro said: “We have been in constant contact with their families and have provided them with every resource needed during this difficult time.” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser interpreted the shooting as a direct assault on America itself, rather than specifically on Trump's policies. Hearing gunfire, other troops in the area ran over and held down the gunman after he was shot, Carroll said. “It appears to be a lone gunman that raised a firearm and ambushed these members of the National Guard,” Carroll said, adding that it was not clear whether one of the guard members or a law enforcement officer shot the suspect. At least one of the guard members exchanged gunfire with the shooter, said another law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Social media video shared in the immediate aftermath showed first responders performing CPR on one of the troops and treating the other on a sidewalk covered in broken glass.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Golf Legend Arnold Palmer, left, ends his round with Fuzzy Zoeller, right, on the eighteenth green at the 66th Senior PGA Championship at Laurel Valley Golf Club in Ligonier, Pa., Friday, May 27, 2005. Fuzzy Zoeller talks with patrons on the 15th tee during practice at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Ga., Tuesday, April 5, 2005. Fuzzy Zoeller, a two-time major champion and one of golf's most gregarious characters whose career was tainted by a racially insensitive joke about Tiger Woods, has died, according to a longtime colleague. A cause of death was not immediately available. Zoeller was the last player to win the Masters on his first attempt, a three-man playoff in 1979. He famously waved a white towel at Winged Foot in 1984 when he thought Greg Norman had beat him, only to defeat Norman in an 18-hole playoff the next day. But it was the 1997 Masters that changed his popularity. Woods was on his way to a watershed moment in golf with the most dominant victory in Augusta National history. Zoeller had finished his round and had a drink in hand under the oak tree by the clubhouse when he was stopped by CNN and asked for his thoughts on the 21-year-old Woods on his way to the most dominant win ever at Augusta National. He's doing everything it takes to win. That moment haunted him the rest of his career. Woods was traveling and it took two weeks for him to comment as the controversy festered. Zoeller later said he received death threats for years after that moment. Writing for Golf Digest in 2008, he said it was “the worst thing I've gone through in my entire life.” “If people wanted me to feel the same hurt I projected on others, I'm here to tell you they got their way,” Zoeller wrote. I've apologized countless times for words said in jest that just aren't a reflection of who I am. “Still, I've come to terms with the fact that this incident will never, ever go away.” It marred a career filled with two famous major titles, eight other PGA Tour titles and a Senior PGA Championship among his two PGA Tour Champions titles. More than winning was how he went about it. Zoeller played fast and still had an easygoing nature to the way he approach the game, often whistling between shots. He made his Masters debut in 1979 and got into a three-way playoff when Ed Sneed bogeyed the last three holes. Zoeller defeated Sneed and Tom Watson with a birdie on the second playoff hole, flinging his putter high in the air. “I've never been to heaven, and thinking back on my life, I probably won't get a chance to go,” Zoeller once said. Zoeller beat him by eight shots in the 18-hole playoff (67-75). Zoeller's lone regret was giving the towel to a kid after he finished in regulation. “If you happen to see a grungy white towel hanging around, get it for me, will you?” he once said. He was born Frank Urban Zoeller Jr. in New Albany, Indiana. He played at a junior college in Florida before joining the powerful Houston golf team before turning pro. Zoeller has three children, including daughter Gretchen, with whom he used to play in the PNC Championship.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Federal agencies are leading a sprawling investigation into the suspect accused of critically injuring two West Virginia National Guard members in what officials called an “ambush-style” shooting yesterday in Washington, DC. • The suspect, identified as an Afghan national named Rahmanullah Lakanwal, drove across the country from his home in Bellingham, Washington,   and used a .357 revolver, according to DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro. He's in custody after being shot by another service member. While a motive is not yet clear, Trump has called the shooting an “act of terror.” After a gunman opened fire yesterday on two National Guard members in Washington, DC, President Donald Trump called for even more troops to be sent to the district. That all comes as a federal judge considers the legality of Trump's National Guard deployment in the first place. DC under federal control: Back in August, Trump placed DC's police department “under direct federal control,” citing a public safety emergency after an assault on a former government worker. Recent ruling: Just last week, a federal judge ruled that Trump's Defense Department illegally deployed the National Guard in the district. The West Virginia National Guard today provided additional information about the two Guard members who were critically wounded in a shooting yesterday in Washington, DC. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, began Guard service on June 26, 2023, and was assigned to the 863rd Military Police Company, 111th Engineer Brigade, West Virginia Army National Guard, a news release states. Andrew Wolfe, 24, joined the Guard on February 5, 2019, and was assigned to the Force Support Squadron, 167th Airlift Wing, West Virginia Air National Guard. Beckstrom, of Summersville, West Virginia, and Wolfe, of Martinsburg, West Virginia, had been deployed in the nation's capital since August when the mission there began, according to the Guard. Both remain hospitalized, state and federal officials said. He was granted asylum in April by the Trump administration, multiple law enforcement officials told CNN. Lakanwal arrived in the US on September 8, 2021, as part of a program called Operation Allies Welcome, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last night. Afghans admitted to the US under the program underwent extensive vetting, and those later granted asylum also underwent additional vetting before it was approved. Most Afghans were allowed to enter and remain in the US for two years without permanent immigration status. In Lakanwal's case, he previously served in NDS-03, one of Afghanistan's elite counterterrorism units that was operated by the CIA with direct US intelligence and military support, according to AfghanEvac. Instead, he applied for asylum during the Biden administration, but application was approved under Trump. Both Lakanwal's Chief of Mission application and his asylum application required review and vetting by the US government, including the CIA, according to AfghanEvac. The suspect in the DC shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, had previously worked with US forces in Afghanistan, officials said Thursday, with CIA Director John Ratcliffe saying in a statement to Fox News that this included the CIA. Here's some context on the Afghans who worked with US partner forces there. Lakanwal would likely have been 18 in 2014, and so of legitimate fighting age by around 2017. By this point, the US presence in Afghanistan had reduced from hundreds of Forward Operating Bases across the country to rely more on targeted operations designed to hobble a growing Taliban insurgency by killing their leaders and key operators. These raids happened nightly, although by 2016 had reduced in intensity. Authorities have yet to specify a motivation for the attack, and scant details have been released by US officials or the CIA about Lakanwal's work for them. Afghan veterans from this fighting would be highly experienced and sullied by the conflict. The NDS ran a series of so-called “Zero Units,” which were well-trained and asked to perform some tasks the US government might have felt squeamish about. They often worked and even lived alongside US special forces, as the US presence in Afghanistan reduced and focused more on sustaining the central government's writ in the capital and regional hubs. Afghans who worked for the NDS and for US special forces can expect to have suffered the same acute combat stress and mental health issues that US veterans themselves have reported. Hundreds of US veterans also worked hard to ensure the Afghans they had fought alongside were among the hundred thousand people who were airlifted from Kabul. Much was made of the vetting of those who were flown from Afghanistan out to various third countries before they reached the United States. “It spread so quickly,” Tara Newcomb of Martinsburg, West Virginia, told CNN. I hope he's doing okay,” added Newcomb, who said 24-year-old Wolfe was just a few years behind her in school. Karen Moore, who works at a local diner, described Martinsburg as a “very friendly” community where “everybody wants to help everybody.” “You know, they have the right to be. Officials provided new details on yesterday's shooting in Washington, DC, that critically wounded two National Guard members. Here's what we learned at the news conference, which wrapped up a short time ago: He is a 29-year-old Afghan national admitted to the US as part of Operation Allies Welcome, and he was granted asylum in April. Both are members of the West Virginia National Guard who were deployed in DC. They remain in critical condition and have undergone surgery. Sprawling investigation: Multiple law enforcement agencies are working a “coast to coast” investigation into the shooting, according to Patel. Investigators aren't ready to name a motive for the attack, Pirro said. President Donald Trump has called the shooting “an act of terror” and quickly used the attack to make a case for an even more intense immigration crackdown. Potential charges: Pirro said the suspect, who was armed with a .357 Smith and Wesson revolver, will be charged with three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. Attorney General Pam Bondi suggested on Fox News earlier today that the administration could possibly pursue terrorism charges and the death penalty. US Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro had a message for the suspect in yesterday's shooting of two National Guard members. Multiple law enforcement agencies are working a “coast to coast” investigation into how and why an Afghan national allegedly traveled from the state of Washington to Washington, DC, and shot two members of the National Guard. The suspect, identified as an Afghan national named Rahmanullah Lakanwal, drove across the country from his home in Bellingham, Washington, to DC, authorities say. “We immediately, with our law enforcement partners in the Metropolitan Police Department and the interagency, secured the scene, seized the weapon, sent in our Evidence Response Team immediately to collect evidence and started doing block-by-block canvases,” FBI Director Kash Patel said this morning. A firearm and other evidence were sent yesterday to the FBI laboratory in Quantico for analysis, Patel said. Investigators interviewed everyone in the suspect's home, he said. Interviews are also being conducted in San Diego “pursuant to our ongoing investigation,” he said. President Donald Trump has arrived at his West Palm Beach, Florida, golf club as the first family spends the Thanksgiving holiday at Mar-a-Lago. Trump was at his golf club on Wednesday when reports of a shooting near the White House began to emerge. He received regular briefings from Attorney General Pamela Bondi, she said during an appearance on Fox News Thursday morning. He delivered an address to the nation from his club late Thursday night. Trump is expected to hold the customary Thanksgiving call with US service members later Thursday. FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed that the suspect in the shooting of two US National Guard members had connections to US forces in Afghanistan. Suspect Rahmanulla Lakanwal “had a relationship in Afghanistan with partner forces,” Patel told reporters during a Thursday news conference. “We are fully investigating that aspect of his background as well, to include any known associates that are either overseas or here in the United States of America,” he said. The two National Guard members who were shot yesterday in Washington, DC, had been on orders in the city since August, according to a statement from the West Virginia National Guard. DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro had earlier said the two service members, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom and 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, were “sworn in” just 24 hours before they were shot, but she didn't immediately clarify what she meant by that. It's too soon to say what the motive is, but there are definitely areas that we're looking into.” Lakanwal is under guard at a DC hospital after being taken down, said Pirro. “He got shot by another guardsmen,” she said. The man authorities say opened fire on service members in Washington, DC, yesterday, gravely wounding two members of the West Virginia National Guard, will be charged with three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for the District of Columbia, said today. The two National Guard members shot in Washington, DC, are in critical condition and have undergone surgery, US Attorney for DC Jeanine Pirro said this morning. Pirro identified the victims of yesterday's shooting as 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom and 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe. Both are members of the West Virginia National Guard who were deployed in DC. The two National Guard members shot in Washington, DC, are in critical condition and have undergone surgery, US Attorney for DC Jeanine Pirro said this morning. We have been in constant contact with their families, and have provided them with every resource needed during this difficult time,” Pirro said at a news conference. Rahmanullah Lakanwal is a 29-year-old Afghan national admitted to the US as part of Operation Allies Welcome, said Pirro. “What we know about him is that he drove his vehicle across country from the state of Washington with the intended target of coming to our nation's capital,” Pirro said. Lakanwal resides in Bellingham with his wife and children, Pirro added. The suspected gunman in yesterday's shooting was armed with a .357 Smith and Wesson revolver, according to DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro. Another guardsman is struck several times,” Pirro said. Other National Guard members who were at the scene “responded immediately,” Pirro added. As two National Guard members lie in critical condition in DC-area hospitals, Attorney General Pamela Bondi said today she would seek the death penalty for their alleged shooter. We will do everything in our power to seek the death penalty against that monster who should not have been in our country.” He was also wounded and taken to a hospital yesterday, authorities said. Again we're praying for a recovery for them, but worst case scenario, minimum, life in prison with terrorism charges,” she said, adding there is still a very active investigation. This post has been updated with additional information. The attorney general said she has spoken multiple times with President Donald Trump as well as DC Mayor Muriel Bowser. She praised the DC Metropolitan Police Department, who she said, “jumped in last night to have the backs of our Guard members, who have always had their backs.” One of the West Virginia National Guard members shot in Washington, DC, was female, Attorney General Pam Bondi said. “She volunteered, as did many of those guardsmen and women, so other people could be home with their families, yet now their families are in hospital rooms with them while they are fighting for their lives,” she said. “Unfortunately, (the DC shooting) is part of a growing trend that we've seen over the past year: increased attacks on our men and women in uniform,” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch told NBC's “Today” show this morning. “That's baked into our planning already for this event.” Tisch said thousands of NYPD officers will be working to protect the parade route. Many that you won't be able to see,” she said.</p>

The Winter Egg by Faberge is displayed at Christie's auction rooms in London, Thursday, Nov. 27, 2025, it is expected to sell for in excess of 20 million UK Pounds when it is auctioned on Dec. 2. LONDON (AP) — A rare crystal and diamond Fabergé egg crafted for Russia's ruling family before it was toppled by revolution is going up for auction, valued at more than 20 million pounds ($26.4 million). Christie's auction house says the Winter Egg is just one of seven of the opulent ovoids remaining in private hands. It will be offered for sale at Christie's London headquarters on Tuesday. The 4-inch (10-centimeter) tall egg is made from finely carved rock crystal, covered in a delicate snowflake motif wrought in platinum and 4,500 tiny diamonds. It opens to reveal a removable tiny basket of bejewelled quartz flowers symbolizing spring. Margo Oganesian, the head of Christie's Russian art department, likened it to a luxurious Kinder Surprise chocolate. The Winter Egg is a superb example of craft and design, “the ‘Mona Lisa' for decorative arts,” Oganesian said. One of just two created by female designer Alma Pihl, the egg was commissioned by Czar Nicholas II for his mother Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna as an Easter present in 1913. Pihl's other egg is owned by Britain's royal family. Czar Alexander III started the tradition by presenting an egg to his wife each Easter. It was believed lost for two decades until it was auctioned by Christie's in 1994 for more than 7 million Swiss francs ($5.6 million at the time). Now it is expected to surpass the record $18.5 million paid at a 2007 Christie's auction for another Fabergé egg created for the Rothschild banking family. There are 43 surviving imperial Fabergé eggs, most in museums.</p>

Lakanawal entered the U.S. under a visa program pushed by former President Joe Biden. Two West Virginia National Guard members remain in critical condition Thursday morning after being shot just blocks from the White House the day before Thanksgiving. The servicemembers have been identified as Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24. They had been sworn in less than 24 hours before the attack. FBI Director Kash Patel said both Guard members are in critical condition. Patrick Morrisey said they had died, but then said he had been receiving conflicting reports about their condition. The suspect taken into custody has been identified as Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal, three law enforcement sources told Fox News Digital. By subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy. Former DOJ prosecutor Jim Trusty joined "Fox News Live" to weigh in on the investigation into the D.C. shooting of two National Guardsmen, describing an FBI-led, multi-state investigation that could move into the federal court. The suspect, 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is currently in police custody. Sarah Beckstrom, one of the National Guard members shot in the nation's capital on Wednesday, suffered a mortal wound and is not likely to recover, her father told The New York Times on Thursday. "I'm holding her hand right now," Gary Beckstrom told the outlet in a phone interview. The status of Andrew Wolfe, the other guard member shot on Wednesday, remains unclear, though he is also in critical condition. U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro says charges against suspect Rahmanullah Lakanwal will be raised to first degree murder if either of the victims die. The suspect in Wednesday's shooting of National Guard troops in the nation's capital was "clean on all checks" in a 2021 background check before he came to the U.S., a senior U.S. official told Fox News. 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal entered the U.S. through former President Joe Biden's Operation Allies Welcome in 2021 during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. During that transition, officials say Lakanwal would have undergone a vetting check by the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). “In terms of vetting, nothing came up,” the official said. Prior to his arrival in the U.S., Lakanwal worked with the CIA in Afghanistan, beginning that work as early as 2011. Officials say was not uncommon for Afghans to falsify their age given the poor recordkeeping by the Afghan government. The official said the U.S. continued an annual vetting process for Afghan evacuees even after they arrived in the U.S., an effort that was redoubled after a foiled terror plot in Oklahoma last year that was linked to another Afghan national. I live in DC and watched as they had virtually nothing to do but pick up trash. Trump White House Communications Director Steven Cheung responded to Mayer's post and said, "Jane, respectfully, shut the f--- up for trying to politicize this tragedy. They were protecting DC and trying to make the nation's capital safer. People like you who engage in ghoulish behavior lose all credibility. Not like you had any to begin with." "If you sat down and tried to come up with a disgraceful response it would be damn near impossible to hit this level. Two guardsmen shot in broad daylight and you not only blame their deployment but then lie to trash and downplay their successful service. Mayer also responded to a post that pointed to the number of homicides in D.C. this year, compared to the number from last year, and accused the person of "mansplaining." "I've covered crime in Washington since 1981- let's skip the mansplaining. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under former President Joe Biden promised to "swiftly and safely" resettle Afghan allies into the United States, but multiple sources have confirmed the D.C. National Guard shooter came in under that same Biden-era program in 2021. Biden responded to the "targeted" attack in D.C. just before news broke of how the alleged shooter, 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal, entered the United States under humanitarian parole via Operation Allies Welcome, per DHS and FBI sources, giving him permission to be in the country legally. In 2021, amid the Afghan withdrawal debacle, Biden's Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas promised to "swiftly and safely" resettle thousands of Afghan allies into the United States and confirmed that DHS had denied evacuees from entering the U.S. due to "derogatory" information obtained during the vetting process. Mayorkas said during a September 2021 press conference that 120,000 people had been evacuated from Afghanistan since the beginning of the U.S. withdrawal, just months earlier. The Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center found that nearly 800 aircraft evacuated thousands of people over just a 17-day period in August 2021. In response to a question at the time from Fox News' Jake Gibson, Mayorkas confirmed that there already had been individuals flagged with "derogatory information" during the vetting process, but did not specify the number of people flagged. Mayorkas assured that 400 U.S. Customs and Border Patrol employees and the Transportation Security Administration would be brought up to assist. The suspect in Wednesday's shooting of National Guard members in Washington, D.C., was vetted by the CIA in Afghanistan and was granted final asylum approval under President Donald Trump's administration, multiple sources told Fox News Digital. CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed earlier Wednesday that the alleged shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, worked for the CIA in Afghanistan out of a base in Kandahar. Priority was given to those who had badges and a history of working with the CIA, such as Lakanwal. While further vetting took place for most Afghans who were airlifted out, sources say having a CIA badge would have placed Lakanwal in the "vetted" category. Fox News' Jennifer Griffin contributed to this report. Patel and Pirro delivered an update on the case in a Thursday morning press conference. "This individual is in this country for one reason and one reason alone, because of the disastrous withdrawal from the Biden administration and the failure to vet in any way, in any way, shape or form this individual and countless others, and this administration has taken the rightful step to stop any further allowance of people with this similar background into the country," Patel said. And that's exactly what happened in this case when you in the prior administration, made the decision to allow thousands of people into this country without doing a single piece of background checking or vetting, that's how you miss every single sign," he continued. The two young National Guard members who were shot in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday were sworn into service less than 24 hours before the attack. She identified the two servicemembers as Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24. "Okay, I also want to say that both Sarah and Andrew, I believe, were sworn in less than 24 hours before they were shot on the street in Washington," Pirro said Thursday. Pirro and FBI Director Kash Patel say the charges against the suspect will hang on whether Beckstrom and Wolfe survive their injuries. Pirro says the two West Virginia guard members are Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24. Both servicemembers have received surgery but remain in critical condition, she said. They came here to protect the district," Pirro said. "Our nation's capital should not and must not be a place where evil comes to commit violence regardless of what their motives may be." Beckstrom and Wolfe had been sworn in as a National Guard member less than 24 hours before the attack. She went on to echo Attorney General Pam Bondi in saying the charges against the suspect depend on the condition of Backstrom and Wolfe, and she called on Americans to pray for their recovery. Lakanwal is an Afghan national who was granted entrance to the U.S. following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan under former President Joe Biden's "Operation Allies Welcome." FBI Director Kash Patel says authorities have executed a search warrant at Lakanwal's residence in Washington state, and interviews with residents there are ongoing. Attorney General Pam Bondi says the Justice Department will do "everything in our power" to seek the death penalty for the Afghan national alleged to have shot two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. Bondi made the comments during a Thursday morning appearance on "Fox & Friends," saying that the two victims are out of surgery but their prognosis remains unclear. The alleged attacker, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, remains in custody. "We will base our charges based on their prognosis, you know, they both came through surgery. I'm not going to talk about their conditions right now," Bondi said. "But if something happens, I will tell you right now. We will do everything in our power to seek the death penalty against that monster who should not have been in our country," she added. Bondi confirmed that the two West Virginia servicemembers are a man and a woman, but their identities are remaining private for the sake of their families. Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national, has been identified as the gunman accused of shooting two National Guard members just blocks from the White House on the day before Thanksgiving, law enforcement sources told Fox News Digital. Lakanwal was taken into custody Wednesday, while authorities said both Guard members were in critical condition. Officials said the shooting is being investigated as a possible act of international terrorism. Intelligence sources told Fox News Digital that Lakanwal had a prior relationship with various entities in the U.S. government, including the CIA, due to his work as a member of a partner force in Kandahar. Lakanwal had been living in Washington state, two law enforcement officials and a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. His former landlord, Kristina Widman, told the outlet that Lakamal arrived in Bellingham, Wash., about four years ago with his wife and five children. How he traveled the roughly 2,500 miles to Washington, D.C., ahead of Wednesday's shooting remains unclear. "Well, look, obviously, as I said, most of us certainly on the Democratic side in Congress don‘t think we should have National Guardsmen and women in our cities," Walkinshaw said. And one of my concerns that I intend to raise as a new member of the Homeland Security Committee is the way in which the Trump administration has taken its eye off the ball in a lot of critical public safety areas and shifted resources to their mass deportation efforts." And they need to get their eyes back on the ball and focus on keeping all of us here in the United States of America safe." Walkinshaw reiterated that he still does not believe National Guard members are needed in the city and urged the Trump administration to redirect those resources elsewhere. "There are a lot of things that the federal government could do to help keep Washington, D.C., safe, and other cities across the country safe," Walkinshaw said. They‘re taking their eyes off of that ball. I think that‘s a better use of the federal resources than National Guardsmen and women in American cities, including the District of Columbia." Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment. President Donald Trump expressed gratitude to the U.S. military following an attack on service members in Washington, D.C., that left two National Guard members in critical condition. "They have taken a selfless oath to defend our nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic," Trump said Wednesday night. "I want to express my extraordinary gratitude to every member of the United States military who is deployed tonight at home and abroad," he continued. "Fox News @ Night" host Kevin Corke said he thought Trump struck "the right tone" with his message. Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.V., said the federal government needs to immediately review every special visa applicant who was allowed to enter the country during the Biden administration, after an Afghan national was accused of shooting two National Guard members on Wednesday. "If these new reports are true, this 'Afghan national' ambushed West Virginia service members in broad daylight—the very ones defending my home state, DC, and beyond." "We need to immediately review each and every special visa applicant who was allowed in under the former administration. Fox News' Landon Mion contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FBI Director Kash Patel and U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro held a press conference on Thanksgiving, revealing a slew of details about the terrorist attack on National Guard members. Pirro added that both Beckstrom and Wolfe had been sworn in for duty less than 24 hours before they were shot. Authorities have identified 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national, as the shooter. Lakanwal allegedly drove to D.C. from his home in Seattle, Washington, before committing the attack. “This is an ongoing investigation of terrorism, make no mistake about it,” Patel said. “We have also executed multiple search warrants around the country, to include the subject's last known residence, which is in state of Washington.” President Donald Trump has blamed the violence on former President Joe Biden's administration, saying they let “unknown and unvetted foreigners” into the country. Lakanwal was let into the country in 2021 as part of Operation Allies Welcome, a program that brought 76,000 evacuated Afghans into the U.S. on humanitarian grounds. The government granted him asylum status earlier this year. Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki assured reporters in 2021 that the thousands of Afghan refugees would be thoroughly screened before arriving in the U.S. “I can absolutely assure you that no one is coming into the United States of America who has not been through a thorough screening and background check process,” Psaki said at the time. Patel told reporters at the Thursday press conference that Department of War officials have informed him of evidence that “the suspect had a relationship in Afghanistan with partner forces” and the FBI is “looking into it.” He added, “The prior administration made the decision to allow thousands of people into this country without doing a single piece of background checking or vetting — that's how you miss every single sign.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Kyrgyz counterpart Sadyr Zhaparov laid a wreath at the Bishkek memorial dedicated to the victory over Nazi Germany. U.S. proposals to end the war between Russia and Ukraine offer a starting point for talks, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday, as he told Ukrainian forces to pull back or be overrun by Russia's bigger army. “We need to sit down and discuss this seriously,” Putin told reporters at the end of a three-day visit to Kyrgyzstan. He described U.S. President Donald Trump's plan as “a set of issues put forward for discussion” rather than a draft agreement. “If Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they occupy, hostilities will cease. If they don't withdraw, we will achieve this by force,” the Russian leader said. Kremlin officials have had little to say so far about the peace plan put forward last week by Trump. Since Russia's invasion of its neighbor, Putin has shown no willingness to budge from his goals in Ukraine despite Trump's push for a settlement. He also wants to keep Ukraine from joining NATO and hosting any Western troops, allowing Moscow to gradually pull the country back into its orbit. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to visit Moscow next week, the Kremlin says, while U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, who in recent weeks has played a high-profile role in the peace efforts, may be heading to Kyiv. The initial U.S. peace proposals appeared heavily skewed toward Russian demands, but an amended version emerged from talks in Geneva on Sunday between American and Ukrainian officials. Trump has previously signaled he could walk away from efforts to stop the fighting if there is no progress. European officials say Putin is stalling because Russia wants to grab more of Ukraine before accepting any deal. Russian officials have claimed they have battlefield momentum in Ukraine, even though their slow progress has been costly in terms of casualties and armor. The Institute for the Study of War on Wednesday cast doubt on Russian claims that its invasion is unstoppable as it is still struggling to capture cities in the eastern Donetsk region. “Data on Russian forces' rate of advance indicates that a Russian military victory in Ukraine is not inevitable, and a rapid Russian seizure of the rest of Donetsk Oblast (region) is not imminent,” the Washington-based think tank said. “Recent Russian advances elsewhere on the front line have largely been opportunistic and exploited seasonal weather conditions.” In the latest example of tension between Moscow and European countries, Russia's Foreign Ministry said Thursday that it had ordered the closure of Poland's Consulate General in the eastern city of Irkutsk. In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that Moscow would not “allow such actions to go unanswered.” Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk later said that two Ukrainian citizens working for Russia were suspected of carrying out the attack. The diplomatic developments have come against a backdrop of continued fighting. Ukraine's army isn't only under pressure on the battlefield. In a development offering some relief, Ukraine reached an agreement for the International Monetary Fund to provide $8.1 billion over four years, according to a statement by the institution. The money comes from a fund that helps countries facing medium-term payment difficulties. Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</p>

As the United States advances a revised peace framework aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, officials and experts from Kyiv, Moscow and Washington tell Fox News Digital the effort is closer to a breakthrough than at any point since Russia's invasion — but still stalled by the same immovable obstacle: the Kremlin wants Ukrainian land, and Ukraine refuses to surrender any of it. President Donald Trump said this week that "tremendous progress" has been made, announcing that his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will meet Russian officials in Moscow while senior U.S. defense leaders sit down with their Ukrainian counterparts. A senior American official confirmed to Fox News Digital that Kyiv has accepted the "broad contours" of an emerging deal, with "minor details" still being negotiated. European allies say they are coordinating a new "Coalition of the Willing," with France calling for a "just and lasting peace." But as Russia launches fresh missile and drone strikes on Kyiv — killing civilians and damaging power infrastructure — negotiators warn that the territorial question remains the hard red line. Ukraine's 44th artillery brigade fires a self-propelled howitzer towards Russian positions at the frontline in the Zaporizhzhia region, Ukraine, Aug. 20, 2025. Oleksii Honcharenko, an opposition member of Ukraine's Parliament, told Fox News Digital he believes Ukraine must pursue peace "as soon as possible," even though large segments of Ukrainian society distrust the emerging plan. I don't like everything in it… some things are unacceptable. "For me, it doesn't matter who the initial author was. Honcharenko acknowledged that sanctions relief — one of Russia's core demands — would be painful for Ukrainians. There will not be a solution I like completely." Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., a House Foreign Affairs committee member, told Fox News Digital the situation reinforces the need for strong American leadership. "Russia invaded Ukraine because Joe Biden was the weakest president in American history." President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visits a flooded area after the Nova Kakhovka dam breached, in Kherson, Ukraine June 8, 2023. Barr, a candidate for U.S. Senate in Kentucky said, "President Trump's peace-through-strength leadership kept Putin fully contained. This war never would have happened under his watch. Trump is the peace president… the only leader who can end this war and bring stability back to Europe." Exiled Russian economist and former deputy finance minister Sergey Aleksashenko echoed the main roadblock: "The biggest difference is territorial," he told Fox News Digital. Ukraine does not want to give up. All other points could be resolved, but not territory." He said he sees no sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin is prepared to compromise, arguing the Kremlin believes Western support for Ukraine is weakening. Putin may be willing to fight "another two, three years," convinced he can outlast Kyiv and European governments struggling to maintain military aid. Retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, the former NATO supreme allied commander, told Fox News Digital he doesn't see Ukraine agreeing to give Russia land Russia has never conquered. Breedlove argued that Putin's goals extend far beyond Ukraine and that the Russian president has been clear about wanting to reshape the security order in Eastern Europe. He also warned that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is negotiating under heavy pressure from Western governments that control Ukraine's access to weapons and funding. "It's very clear he's being threatened with no support," Breedlove said. "If Mr. Zelenskyy loses the support of America and Europe, life's going to be really ugly for Ukraine. He said early versions of the U.S. proposal included "egregious" provisions that Ukraine never would have agreed to, but that the process has "improved" as Kyiv's input was incorporated. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and others join the Ukrainian delegation before closed-door talks on ending Russia's war in Ukraine, at the U.S. Mission in Geneva, Switzerland, Nov. 23, 2025. Breedlove pushed back on the claim that Kyiv is ready to concede territory, saying lawmakers want peace but not capitulation. "I believe there are many parliamentary hearings and many in Zelenskyy's group that want peace, but they want a durable, equitable peace. I'm not sure that they're ready to make a lot of concessions to do that," he said. As negotiators move toward what they hope will be a final round of talks, all sides agree on one point: the success or failure of this effort will depend on whether Ukraine and Russia — under pressure from allies, including incentives from Washington and the realities of the battlefield — can finally bridge the territorial divide that has defined the war from day one.

Former Yuma sector border patrol chief Chris Clem joins 'Fox News Live' to react to the attack on National Guards in Washington, D.C. and the impact of illegal immigration under the Biden administration. Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national, has been identified as the gunman accused of shooting two National Guard members just blocks from the White House on the day before Thanksgiving, law enforcement sources told Fox News Digital. Lakanwal was taken into custody Wednesday, while authorities said both Guard members were in critical condition. Officials said the shooting is being investigated as a possible act of international terrorism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spartanburg County, in South Carolina's Upstate region, has been fighting a measles outbreak since early October, with more than 50 cases identified. Health officials have encouraged people who are unvaccinated to get a shot by visiting its mobile vaccine clinic at any of its several stops throughout the county. But on a Monday afternoon in Boiling Springs, only one person showed up. “We had hoped to see a more robust uptake than that in our mobile health units.” As South Carolina tries to contain its measles outbreak, public health officials across the nation are concerned that the highly contagious virus is making a major comeback. The largest started in Texas, where hundreds of people were infected and two children died. For the first time in more than two decades, the United States is poised to lose its measles elimination status, a designation indicating that outbreaks are rare and rapidly contained. But it shows how a confluence of larger national trends — including historically low vaccination rates, skepticism fueled by the pandemic, misinformation, and “health freedom” ideologies proliferated by conservative politicians — have put some communities at risk for the reemergence of a preventable, potentially deadly virus. “Everyone talks about it being the canary in the coal mine because it's the most contagious infectious disease out there,” said Josh Michaud, associate director for global and public health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. “The logic is indisputable that we're likely to see more outbreaks.” Spartanburg's vaccination rate is among the lowest of South Carolina's 46 counties. And that was true “even before covid,” said Chris Lombardozzi, a senior vice president with the Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System. Nearly 6,000 children in Spartanburg County schools last year — 10% of the total enrollment — either received an exemption allowing them to forgo required vaccinations or did not meet vaccine requirements, according to data published by the state. Lombardozzi said the county's low vaccination rate is tied to misinformation not only published on social media but also spread by “a variety of nonmedical leaders over the years.” Michaud said that fear and misinformation surrounding covid vaccines “threw gasoline on the fire of people's vaccine skepticism.” In some cases, that skepticism transferred to childhood vaccines, which historically have been less controversial, he said. This made communities like Spartanburg County with low vaccination rates more vulnerable. “Which is why we're seeing constant, small brush fires of measles outbreaks,” Michaud said. Acting CDC director, citing Trump directive, calls for MMR shot to be split into three despite no evidence of benefit Children who attend public and private schools in South Carolina are required to show that they've received some vaccinations, including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, but religious exemptions are relatively easy to obtain. That's particularly true in the Upstate region, where religious exemptions have increased sixfold from a decade ago. By fall 2024, that number had jumped to more than 13,000. No one from Global Academy responded to interview requests. In April, after visiting a Texas family whose daughter had died from measles, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote on social media that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” He made a similar statement during an interview on “Dr. But these endorsements stand at odds with other statements Kennedy has made that cast doubt on vaccine safety and have falsely linked vaccines with autism. The CDC, under his authority, now claims such links “have been ignored by health authorities.” Throughout 2025, he has made other misleading or unsupported statements. During a congressional hearing in September, Kennedy defended his past claims that he was not anti-vaccine but affirmed his stated position that no vaccines are safe or effective. Meanwhile, Kennedy has frequently championed the idea of health freedom, or freedom of choice, regarding vaccines, a talking point that has taken root among Republicans. Canada loses its measles elimination status amid large outbreak Henry McMaster, said the governor was not available to be interviewed for this article but referenced McMaster's comment from October that measles “is a dangerous disease, but in terms of diseases, it's not one that we should panic about.” On a separate occasion that month, the Republican governor said he does not support vaccine mandates. During a legislative hearing in April, Republican state lawmakers voted against his permanent confirmation because of his past support for covid vaccines and masking. Public health officials in other states also have been blocked from new roles because of their covid response. In Missouri, where MMR vaccine rates have declined among kindergartners since 2020 and measles cases have been reported this year, Republican lawmakers rejected a public health director in 2022 after vaccine opponents protested his appointment. South Carolina Sen. Tom Davis of Beaufort was the only Republican on the Senate Medical Affairs Committee who voted to confirm Simmer in April. He told KFF Health News that his Republican colleagues raised valid questions about Simmer's past support for covid vaccines. The Department of Public Health had administered 44 doses of the MMR vaccine through its mobile health unit from October to mid-November. The agency's tracking system shows that providers across Spartanburg County administered more than twice as many measles vaccines in October as they did a year ago. Cases have also been linked to a church and Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport. KFF Health News correspondent Amy Maxmen contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>California's $12 billion budget deficit is not stopping state lawmakers from sending hundreds of millions for pet projects to their home districts this year, a decision that could shape the fate of at least two Democrats seeking higher elected office. In all, Golden State lawmakers spent at least $415 million on local projects to help curry favor with constituents and win their next election. There were nearly 100 earmarks tucked into just one of the state's budget bills for local projects and programs that had little to no benefit for anyone outside of the specific lawmaker's district. “Politicians across generations — and in every country — try to use some portion of the budget on these clear signals that they're directing the flow of government dollars to real people and real organizations right at home in their district,” said Thad Kousser, a former legislative staffer and political science professor at the University of California, San Diego. The pork spending this year went to general funds for museums, trails, and other amenities, some of which are in well-to-do communities. It also raised concerns about legislative priorities in a year where Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) has spoken repeatedly about tightening pursestrings due to funding cuts and the threat of funding cuts from the Trump administration. The earmarks arrived as Newsom and state lawmakers left key state jobs vacant, backed away from their universal healthcare pledges, controversially plugged budget holes with costly high-interest borrowing, and tapped billions from California's “rainy day” reserve, CalMatters reported. Lawmakers redirected $250 million from Proposition 4, a $10 billion climate bond approved in 2024 to fund projects related to the Safe Drinking Water, Wildfire Prevention, Drought Preparedness, and Clean Air Bond Act. After losing his legislative leadership seat earlier this year, Democratic state Sen. Mike McGuire, who is running for Congress next year, hauled in among the most funds of any state legislator. McGuire's district, which stretches from the San Francisco Bay to the Oregon border and includes parts of Sonoma, Marin, Mendocino, Lake, Humboldt, Trinity, and Del Norte counties, was the recipient of more than two dozen earmarks totaling more than $100 million. Wiener, who chairs the state's powerful Senate Budget Committee, secured $9 million in general fund earmarks that will directly help San Franciscans, many of whom will decide his congressional fate. Some other big-dollar projects across the state included $20 million to help the public access a Santa Barbara County beach gated off by rich celebrities, a cattle operation, and 8 miles of undeveloped Pacific Ocean shoreline, as well as $15 million for “geological heritage sites” including the La Brea Tar Pits, which has been used to study climate change.</p>

Longtime NBA veteran Kevin Love talks to Fox News Digital about the "stain" of gambling in professional sports and his hopes for a resolution. Odds are that most Thanksgiving dinners will include a heaping helping of Packers-Lions. A run back out to the fridge for a plate of stuffing alongside the nightcap game of Bengals-Ravens. But many fans are now lured by very specific bets. You can wager money on how many passing attempts Lamar Jackson has or how many penalties the Lions will commit. The American Gaming Association says sportsbooks scored a staggering $13.71 billion in revenue last year. Astonishing betting scandals recently rocked the NBA and Major League Baseball. Portland Trail Blazers head coach and Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups pleaded not guilty earlier this week to charges of taking part in an illegal poker scheme with possible ties to organized crime. Terry Rozier of the Miami Heat is due for arraignment on Dec. 8. But bettors placed hundreds of thousands of dollars in wagers on how many points Rozier might score, as well as rebounds and assists. And the feds busted Cleveland Guardians pitchers Luis Ortiz and Emmanuel Clase for allegedly conspiring with bettors to throw specific pitches at specific times during the games. Emmanuel Clase, left, and Luis Ortiz, were indicted in a federal gambling probe on Nov. 9, 2025. "You may not be able to throw a strike 10% of the time. But even a lousy pitcher as I am could throw a ball 100% of the time," said Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Cruz, R-Texas. "These cheating scandals threaten to undermine the integrity of sports." That's why Cruz and the top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Maria Cantwell, of Washington state, wrote to Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred. They want answers on suspicious wagers and whether there are any other instances of alleged rigging. Cruz and Cantwell fired off a letter to the NBA as well. "We need these organizations to make sure that there's rules and regulations in place that are followed," said Cantwell. "What you should do to make sure that people are complying." Ted Cruz and Maria Cantwell during a Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on April 2, 2025. "If you're watching a game and you think, ‘Is this the glorious uncertainty of sport, or is this some theater designed by gambling mobsters and their addicted athletes?' then the joy of sport is dead, ladies and gentlemen," said University of New Haven professor Declan Hill after a meeting with lawmakers. People don't wager on overall outcomes of games or who might win the division or conference, but instead place their money on individual events during the game. "We are a long way from the Black Sox scandal," said John Affleck, Knight Chair in Sports Journalism and Society at Penn State. "We're now in a place where the first corner kick or the number of points you score in the first half can be manipulated if you have a willing athlete," said Affleck. Sports leagues have all cozied up to commercial gambling operations over the past few years. Some lawmakers believe betting scandals were inevitable once the leagues and the gaming industry parlayed their fortunes together. "These growing scandals simply highlight the need for national standards that stop the sports betting industry from exploiting vulnerable gamblers and the potential corruption among the players themselves," said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. "The sports betting industry has grown huge without any kind of safeguards against the use of algorithms and micro bets to target individuals, whether they are gamblers or players in sports." Congress hasn't passed a gambling law since 2006. Lawmakers say the leagues should tread carefully with gambling. Fans could lose interest if they think the sports are rigged. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced in June that he wouldn't run for a third term in the Senate when he is up for re-election in 2026. "All these scandals," said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. "People are going to get tired of it and move on. I mean, my God, football, basketball, baseball should all be worried now that watching people play video games is a spectator sport." And we reside in a period when people routinely take to social media to claim that the leagues only want certain teams to succeed or that the refs or umpires are biased against their club. "It's impossible to ignore the similarities between sportsbooks today and the big tobacco efforts of decades earlier," said Rep. Paul Tonko, D-N.Y. "Instead of ads with doctors recommending cigarettes, it's celebrities teaching viewers how to bet." Tonko said one in five Americans bet on sports at least once a month and 7 million people have a gambling problem. He added that one in five of those addicted to gambling will attempt suicide. "In short, we are dealing with a massive and growing public health crisis involving a known addictive product," said Tonko. Affleck believes gaming apps have "a particular appeal to younger bettors, which raises some alarm bells about early addiction." So Congress is investigating, but it's unclear if anything will come of the inquiry into the recent pro-betting scandals. "I think there's a risk of Congress overstepping," said Eric Schmitt, arguing that regulation of gaming should be left to the states. So will much come of the congressional probe? Will we see gaming legislation from lawmakers? Considering the current dysfunction of Congress, don't bet on it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The suspected shooter of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday is a native of Afghanistan who previously worked in the United States for multiple government agencies, one of which was the Central Intelligence Agency. Two National Guard troops shot outside of Farragut West Metro station in D.C., the Washington Examiner is on the scene. CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed Lakanwal's previous association with the CIA and other U.S. government agencies in an interview with Fox News. ​​”The individual — and so many others — should have never been allowed to come here,” added Ratcliffe. “Our citizens and service members deserve far better than to endure the ongoing fallout from the Biden administration's catastrophic failures.” As the Washington Examiner previously reported, Lakanwal is accused of shooting two West Virginia National Guard members near the Farragut West Metro station, located in close proximity to the White House. Both victims were reportedly in critical condition and being treated at nearby hospitals. “The animal that shot the two National Guardsmen, with both being critically wounded, and now in two separate hospitals, is also severely wounded, but regardless, will pay a very steep price,” said Trump. Patrick Morrisey announced that both victims had died as a result of their injuries from the shooting. As of Thursday morning, there were conflicting reports about their survival.</p>

His vow came as authorities held a man Trump described as an Afghan national over the shooting of two West Virginia National Guard reservists in Washington, DC. “America will never bend and never yield in the face of terror, and at the same time, we will not be deterred from the mission these service members were so nobly fulfilling,” Trump said. But he also used the moment to drive home his campaign against other migrants in politically charged remarks that went far beyond Afghanistan — at a moment when his administration is moving to reinterview some refugees admitted under President Joe Biden and revoking temporary protected status for those from several dangerous world hot spots. Trump lashed out at Somali immigrants in Minnesota, despite there being no apparent connection with the DC shooting. But Trump's comments were characteristic of a president who rarely waits for full clarity before engaging politically. Scrutiny may also fall on any follow-up immigration proceedings for the suspect that stretched into Trump's second term. Then there's the question of whether there were intelligence failures by Trump's team ahead of Wednesday's attack, at a time when government agencies are accused by critics of diverting resources from national security to immigration enforcement. He vowed to “reexamine every single alien” who came to the US from Afghanistan, in remarks that will likely create fear among law-abiding immigrants — many of whom helped the US military and diplomats at considerable risk to themselves and their families during America's longest war. The president's senior White House adviser Stephen Miller said on Fox News after the attack that Trump had made a “historic announcement, a brave announcement.” “What you heard tonight from President Trump, the breaking news here tonight, is saying that his government is going to accelerate efforts to review every person added this country over the last four years,” Miller said. “But everybody else who was brought here, refugee, asylum status, whatever status … if you're not someone who loves this country, if you're not any benefit to this country, then we're going to send you out of this country.” Trump's extremely political remarks may also have been designed to shut down any suggestions that the National Guard soldiers patrolling Washington in their fatigues have been left vulnerable by an ill-defined mission. A political storm has raged around the National Guard since Trump ordered it into some US cities. The shootings in Washington, DC, were the latest shocking outburst of public violence in a wrenching year that saw the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and killing of a state lawmaker and her husband in Minnesota. Wednesday's tragedy took on extra poignancy as Americans gathered with their families ahead of the national holiday, and cut deep for the people of West Virginia, which is among several states to send volunteer reservists to DC. National Guard troops sent to Washington have been notable for their good humor and professionalism. But suddenly the possible danger that comes with their mission has come into sharp focus. In their military fatigues, National Guard troops are highly visible — as seems to be Trump's intent for deterrence purposes — but that can also leave them exposed. That theory will raise counter-terrorism concerns over whether the alleged shooter had a motivation to target US soldiers directly and whether other attacks are possible. The administration had also filed an emergency court order seeking to keep guard troops in the city after a federal judge last week ordered their removal, pending appeal. The National Guard's initial deployment to Washington was hugely controversial and is part of a wider strategy that has seen reservists sent to other cities, including Los Angeles. Trump, who cultivates a strongman image, has long appeared keen to deploy troops on domestic soil, despite laws limiting their use in law enforcement missions. He called the guard to Washington in August while placing the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control and mobilizing officers from other agencies, arguing the city was a “filthy and crime ridden embarrassment” despite official data showing that crime was falling. But critics warned that deploying troops was unnecessary and carried authoritarian overtones. That debate was already being revisited following Wednesday's shooting, with a White House official forcefully rebutting criticism over the necessity of the guard's presence in DC as an attempt to “politicize this tragedy.” Trump has argued that his Washington, DC, crackdown is a huge success, and that people now feel safe in the capital. It's unclear how the Thanksgiving shooting, which sent scores of people running from the scene, will influence perceptions of his strategy. Critics of Trump's approach have long worried that, far from making DC safer, the presence of uniformed troops on the streets could cause more tensions and that the soldiers could themselves be vulnerable. After the initial shock of seeing khaki-clad troops on the streets and vehicles in military livery, many Washingtonians have come to see Guard members as a largely benign presence. They are often seen milling outside Metro stations and even picking up litter in “beautification” projects. But federal District Judge Jia Cobb wrote last week, in an order ruling that the Guard was illegally deployed in Washington, that there was a “substantial risk” that their presence “is going to lead to a dangerous or deadly encounter that could be catastrophic for public safety.” Now that troops have been the victims of an attack, Democrats are sure to question Trump's decision-making. California Rep. Robert Garcia told CNN's Jim Sciutto that the attack was “horrific” and said he was thinking about “the entire Guard family.” He added that he wasn't sure Trump's ask for 500 additional troops was “the right call” and that decisions about the security situations should be left to local officials. “You've put National Guardsman in a bad position, now you have got them serving as law enforcement … that's not what they were trained to do,” former Washington, DC, Police Chief Charles Ramsey told CNN. “You have got to really stop and think about what is it that are you trying to accomplish,” Ramsey said. Nebraska Republican Rep. Don Bacon told CNN that in such an escalated political climate, everyone should react temperately to the horrific incident in Washington. “It is very incumbent on all of us, Democrats and Republicans, in the news, that we treat each other decently, we can disagree without being over the top, angry, throwing gas, lighting things on fire right now — our society, this hyper-partisanship that we have.” But a tragedy like this is sure to have political implications.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump criticized former President Joe Biden for overseeing the post-Afghanistan immigration policy. “He was flown in by the Biden administration in September 2021 on those infamous flights that everybody was talking about,” Trump said in a televised address from West Palm Beach, Florida. Nobody knew anything about it,” the president added. “His status was extended under legislation signed by President Biden, a disastrous president, the worst in the history of our country.” Lakanwal overstayed his visa, which reportedly expired in September this year. His last address was recorded in Washington state. Without naming the suspect, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed he was an Afghan national who took advantage of Biden's lax immigration policy. “The suspect who shot our brave National Guardsmen is an Afghan national who was one of the many unvetted, mass paroled into the United States under Operation Allies Welcome on September 8, 2021, under the Biden Administration,” she wrote on X. “I will not utter this depraved individual's name. In his speech, Trump said Wednesday's shooting “underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation,” addressing the Biden administration's admission of illegal immigrants. He then cited Minnesota as an example of a state that has been too lenient in letting in foreigners, particularly Somali nationals. “Gangs of Somalians come from a country that doesn't even have a government — no laws, no water, no military, no nothing — as their representatives in our country preach to us about our Constitution and how our country is no good,” he said, seemingly referencing Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who was born in Somalia. “We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country,” he continued. “Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” the agency said in a statement. Hours earlier, the suspected gunman fired shots at two West Virginia National Guard members with a handgun near the White House. The wounded suspect was swiftly apprehended, and the two troops remain in critical condition as they receive medical treatment at a local hospital.</p>
