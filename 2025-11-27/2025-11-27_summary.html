The administration has already begun to use the incident to stoke fears about Afghan immigrants.

Following Wednesday's shooting of two National Guard troops in Washington, DC, President Donald Trump has responded with a pair of authoritarian measures: flooding the city with hundreds more guard members and pledging a crackdown against Afghan immigrants.

A suspect is in custody after firing at the two guard members outside the White House, which left them in critical condition. The suspect — who was also shot and is now hospitalized — has been identified by law enforcement as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who relatives say served alongside US troops in Afghanistan during America's two-decade war. According to senior law enforcement agents, the shooting is being investigated as a potential act of terrorism.

Within hours of the shooting, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that the Trump administration was deploying an additional 500 National Guard troops to DC, adding to the 2,200 that are already present as part of what Trump has claimed is a crackdown on surging crime.

In reality, crime had fallen to record lows in the city for over a year before Trump sent in the troops this past August over the objections of DC officials. This week the president falsely claimed that the city had not had a single homicide since his troop surge began.

In comments to the Guardian, Gary Goodweather, a Democratic candidate in next year's mayoral election and a former US Army captain who served in the National Guard, said Trump's deployment of troops against US citizens made such a backlash inevitable.

“If I'm completely honest, we've been expecting this. It hurts me to the core,” he said. “Look around us. These are citizens, they're residents, they're human beings. Activating the United States military against people within our own country, within Washington, DC, is the wrong message.”

He added that he feared sending even more troops would just “inflame” tensions further.

David Janovsky, acting director of the Constitution Project at the Project on Government Oversight, described the response as an unnecessary overreach.

“No one should be harmed just for doing their job, and our thoughts are with them and their families,” he said of the two guard members. “At the same time, we do not believe that sending even more troops into the city is the solution. By sending more troops in, the administration risks inflaming tensions and undermining civil rights. As more information comes to light about this despicable tragedy, we urge against the administration putting more armed troops on our street corners.”

The new surge of federal troops follows a court ruling issued last week by US District Judge Jia Cobb, who wrote that the Trump administration “exceeded the bounds of their authority” and “acted contrary to law” by deploying the National Guard “for nonmilitary, crime-deterrence missions in the absence of a request from the city's civil authorities.”

That ruling barred the Trump administration from sending any more troops to DC. However, it is delayed from going into effect until December 11 to give the administration time to appeal.

Thus far, no motive for the attack has been determined. But Trump has already begun to use it to stoke fears about Afghan immigrants.

“We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under [former President Joe] Biden,” Trump said in an address Wednesday night in which he called the shooting an “act of terror.” The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) then announced that “effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols.”

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem claimed via social media that Lakanwal, the alleged shooter, was “mass paroled into the United States under Operation Allies Welcome,” the program to allow Afghans who served alongside the US military to seek refuge in the US following the Taliban's return to power in 2021. According to a June 2025 audit by the Office of the Inspector General, around 90,000 “vulnerable” Afghans were admitted to the US under the program.

While Noem said those admitted under the program were “unvetted,” this is untrue. As the audit shows, the program assigned several agencies to screen evacuees, check terror watch lists and criminal history, and attempt identity verification. It stated that in cases where it discovered evacuees on terror watch lists, “in each of these cases, we determined that the FBI notified the appropriate external agencies at the time of watch list identification and followed all required internal processes to mitigate any potential threat.”

Trump's pledge to reexamine every Afghan who entered the US under Biden came just days after his administration announced that it was freezing the distribution of green cards for over 235,000 refugees for what it said was “detailed screening and vetting,” even though residents who arrive through the refugee process are already among the most heavily vetted immigrants who enter the United States.

Speaking of the alleged DC shooter, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said: “We have no idea what this man's motive was at this point, and yet the Trump administration is already moving to paint every Afghan as a threat to this country. This comes as the country has dealt with dozens of mass shootings this year alone, carried out by people of varied origins.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

A new vision for the United States is being forced into place — one rooted not in liberty or justice, but in subjugation and the quiet normalization and acceptance of fascism. You can see it in the memes, the slogans, and the curated nostalgia flooding social media accounts aligned with the Trump administration. You can see it in the way frontier and 1950s iconographies have returned not as history but as aspiration. And you can see it in the current administration's campaign to control what young people learn about history, colonization, slavery, genocide, and the violent foundations of this country.

This revival is not about remembering the past or indulging in a trendy, nostalgic aesthetic. It's about promoting and embracing a version of “America” built on authoritarianism and white supremacy. It's a version that elevates conquest, cruelty, and dominance as virtue and heritage over liberty and justice. It's a digital-age rebranding of Manifest Destiny — the idea that the United States was ordained to expand across the North American continent, seizing land, displacing and eradicating Indigenous people in the name of progress — now crafted to make subjugation look like patriotism and to turn historical distortion into accepted truth.

That is why an incident like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's defense of the Medals of Honor awarded to the soldiers who carried out the Wounded Knee Massacre is dangerous. And that incident was far from an isolated example of the Trump administration actively embracing and defending the violent legacy of Manifest Destiny and the belief systems that justified genocide and land theft.

Indeed the official social media account of the Department of Homeland Security posted the painting American Progress by John Gast on X — a scene that portrays westward expansion as a noble mission, with a floating white woman carrying “civilization” toward the frontier, while settlers, soldiers, trains, and telegraph lines push Indigenous people and buffalo into darkness and out of the frame — alongside the text, “A Heritage to be proud of, a Homeland worth Defending.” Examples like these are evidence of a larger project that uses nostalgia as a political weapon and mythmaking as a tool to justify violence.

This narrative shapes policy, fuels immigration enforcement, and drives efforts to suppress education about Thanksgiving and the realities of colonization. It transforms federal agencies, social media, and public institutions into extensions of a worldview that treats Indigenous people as obstacles, the “Indian Problem” that the U.S. must still eradicate.

Across campaign-aligned pages, far right networks, and the administration's own digital channels, westward expansion has been recast as an aspirational identity. The genocide, land theft, forced removals, and destruction of Indigenous nations that built the frontier are erased, and what remains is a cinematic mythology built for political use.

Federal agencies have circulated frontier-themed memes meant to promote everything from joining ICE to pro-natalism.

This reframing is not limited to fringe accounts. Federal agencies have circulated frontier-themed memes meant to promote everything from joining Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to pro-natalism. When institutions tied to national security adopt the language of “restoring the frontier” and “taking back the country,” they lay the groundwork for violent policies that demand reclaiming and recreating an imagined past at any cost.

The nostalgia is intentional because it shapes how people feel before they decide what to believe. Once that groundwork is laid, the defense of injustice and violent authoritarianism, like Hegseth's insistence that Wounded Knee soldiers “deserved” their medals or violent ICE raids at daycare centers and workplaces, no longer shocks. It becomes an extension of the myth of American Exceptionalism wrapped in patriotism. As it becomes more normalized, injustice becomes inevitable, and inevitability becomes destiny.

The administration's modern Manifest Destiny stretches into the operations of federal agencies tasked with policing borders and communities. ICE has become one of the most powerful tools in this new frontier project, targeting Indigenous people under the guise of national restoration.

Navajo and Tohono O'odham leaders said the recent detentions mirror older federal efforts to control Indigenous movement and identity. They pointed to cases where Navajo citizens carrying state IDs and Certificates of Indian Blood were still detained or questioned by ICE, and where Tohono O'odham citizens were told that their ties to their own homelands did not matter because officials only recognized the border. These incidents reflect a long-standing pattern of dismissing tribal documents, Indigenous mobility, and Indigenous identity as invalid. In Iowa, a member of the Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community was nearly turned over to federal immigration agents after the Polk County Jail issued an ICE detainer meant for someone else. As Iowa Public Radio reported, police told the 24-year-old woman's family that she would be removed to a country she had never lived in. She avoided deportation only because the jail finally acknowledged the detainer was filed in error.

These cases reveal a pattern rather than isolated mistakes. The American Immigration Council recently warned that the Supreme Court's refusal to limit racial profiling in immigration enforcement has given officers even more room to target people based on appearance alone. This puts Indigenous people at particular risk, since tribal identification, Native languages, and even clear proof of citizenship are often ignored or treated as suspect by federal agents. The result is a system where Indigenous identity itself becomes grounds for questioning, detention, or removal, no matter how much documentation a person carries.

The Indian Law Resource Center has also sounded the alarm, noting that many of those targeted for removal are Indigenous migrants whose nations long predate the borders being used against them. The center points to the planned deportation of more than 600 Guatemalan children, at least 90 percent of whom are Maya, stressing that these children are Indigenous people with rights under both U.S. and international law.

These cases reveal a deeper reality. The same systems that once worked to erase Indigenous nations within the United States are now being used to remove Indigenous children and families from beyond its borders. It reflects the same thinking that once justified westward expansion. The ideology did not disappear; it simply learned to present itself in new ways.

The administration's revival of Manifest Destiny builds on this ongoing pattern of targeting Indigenous peoples, shifting it into the realm of imagery and narrative using a nostalgic blend of frontier myth and mid-century Americana to normalize subjugation and erase accountability. When that narrative takes root, it becomes easier to dismiss harm, ignore injustice, and discredit those who speak against it. This same narrative machinery is at work to shape how people in the U.S. understand Thanksgiving.

For many households, the holiday is a time to gather with loved ones, share a meal, watch football, and express gratitude. Many Native people celebrate in these ways too, because feasting is Indigenous, and we also enjoy good food and football. Yet the holiday carries a heavier weight for our communities. It marks the beginning of a violent era of colonization set in motion when European settlers arrived on these lands.

For generations, Thanksgiving has been offered as a simple tale of peace between settlers and Native peoples, a comforting story that reassures the country of its own goodness. This “friendly” version of Thanksgiving serves the broader strategies of historical revisionism used to justify settler colonialism by distorting, minimizing, or erasing the violence, exploitation, and resistance at the heart of this nation's formation. These myths reinforce settler identity and national pride, encouraging people to avoid uncomfortable truths and discouraging any critical engagement with our shared, complicated history.

Even so, Native communities have never stopped pushing back against the sanitized Thanksgiving narrative.

In Plymouth, the National Day of Mourning has gathered hundreds of participants each year since 1970 to confront the Thanksgiving myth at its origin point. On Alcatraz Island, the Indigenous Peoples Sunrise Gathering honors resistance, survival, and sovereignty. Across Native nations, youth-led teach-ins, community fasts, and cultural events counter the national narrative with history, presence, and truth.

These gatherings do more than disrupt the myth. They expose the fragility of American exceptionalism and the power of Indigenous memory, survival, and resistance.

The struggle over history, from Wounded Knee to Thanksgiving to ICE detentions, is not a debate about the past. It is a struggle over who defines America and whose humanity matters.

The struggle over history, from Wounded Knee to Thanksgiving to ICE detentions, is not a debate about the past. It is a struggle over who defines America and whose humanity matters. A nation that cannot face its own history cannot repair its present. A country that denies genocide cannot claim justice. A society that clings to myth will repeat the violence it refuses to see.

Telling the truth about the United States, the beauty and the brutality, the promises kept and the promises broken, is not destroying the country. Insisting on telling the truth asserts that we are capable of more than myth and refuse to accept a future shaped by denial, distortion, and the quiet normalization of authoritarianism. Honesty is the path that lets us reconcile with our complicated histories, repair the harm that continues, and choose a different way forward.

When we confront our history with honesty instead of lies, we create the possibility of a country where life, liberty, and justice are not privileges for the few but shared, inalienable rights for all. That is the measure of a nation brave enough to face itself. That is the only way the United States can ever live up to its own reputation as the land of the free, not as a slogan, but as a lived reality.

“I'm not against giving thanks. I'm against celebrating a falsehood,” says Choctaw historian A. S. Dillingham.

“The assault by the Trump administration on honest history is hitting everyone,” A. S. Dillingham, a tribal member of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma and a historian at Arizona State University, says.

This assault on history is particularly glaring this week, as repression and censorship push teachers and politicians alike to acquiesce to the celebration of a sanitized falsehood instead of using the Thanksgiving holiday as an opportunity to reckon with the dispossession and genocide that white settlers inflicted upon Indigenous peoples after arriving in the Americas.

In the interview that follows, Dillingham — the author of Oaxaca Resurgent: Indigeneity, Development, and Inequality in Twentieth-Century Mexico, who often shares his analysis on X at @asdillingham — explains how Thanksgiving functions to whitewash the history of settler colonialism. As a scholar whose work centers Indigenous history, colonialism, and education, Dillingham also has invaluable insights to share on how we can teach honestly about Indigenous history, even amid the current political climate.

The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity.

Jesse Hagopian: A couple of years ago you wrote a critique of the traditional Thanksgiving story that was published in The Washington Post. Can you talk about the reaction to it?

A. S. Dillingham: The reaction was revealing. After that piece ran, I got a wave of angry emails. One person even asked, “What do you have against being thankful?” — as if critiquing a national myth means I don't appreciate gratitude or sharing a good meal with family and friends.

When people frame my critique as an attack on gratitude, they're missing the point. I'm not against giving thanks. I'm against celebrating a falsehood instead of reckoning with the history Indigenous peoples have survived.

A single (largely inaccurate) tale of supposed harmony has been turned into a national origin story that hides the real foundations of the United States.

As a historian and a member of the Choctaw Nation, what do you see as the most damaging myths embedded in the Thanksgiving story? And what truths do those myths work to obscure about the real relationship between Indigenous nations and the U.S. settler state?

I think the Thanksgiving myth, like any myth, is based on some historical facts and then some lies and misrepresentations. The Thanksgiving story is based on real events that took place in 1621: a meal was shared between Pilgrims and the Wampanoag. But basically, the way that story is told in our public celebrations or in school pageants has very little to do with the historical reality.

There was a shared meal, but it wasn't a kind of Thanksgiving. The Wampanoag heard Pilgrims shooting off their rifles in celebration, and they came running to assist because there was a mutual defense pact between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag. And so it was basically a meal shared after a misunderstanding. What we celebrate today has very little to do with what actually happened. That mythologized version of those events was then taken up at the end of the U.S. Civil War: President Lincoln declared it an official holiday in 1863. And it was part of an effort to unite a brutally divided country.

“For much of the first few centuries of European settlement, Europeans were actually the weaker party, and they were trying to hold on to a continent they did not control.”

In terms of your question about what the myth obscures, I think one of the things it does is assert that there was a peaceful existence between Native people and Pilgrims in New England, and we celebrate that as the foundational story of the United States. That myth obscures some of the other central dynamics of early colonial history, which were that for the first century or two of European settlement in the Americas, Native Americans controlled the vast majority of the North American continent. European settlers, including the Pilgrims, were basically hanging on to the edges of the continent and were forced to stay in colonial outposts in which their security and often their material well-being were based on their ability to make alliances with Native Americans who were more powerful than them.

Native Americans and the Pilgrims were assisting each other and had a kind of working relationship, but for much of the first few centuries of European settlement, Europeans were actually the weaker party, and they were trying to hold on to a continent they did not control.

By centering the story of New England and Plymouth and the Pilgrims, it obscures other English settlements, like Jamestown, where one of the central dynamics was the African slave trade. The fact is, both African people and Indigenous people were enslaved, trafficked, and forced into servitude by the colonists. That's a key truth the Thanksgiving story erases.

That framework for understanding the origins of our country is so important — especially as next year marks the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States, and there will be so many celebrations of the nation that don't wrestle with these difficult truths. I also want to connect this to our current political moment. In an era of book bans, curriculum gag orders, and demands for “patriotic education,” how does the Thanksgiving narrative function within this broader struggle over who gets to define American history?

We are living in a period in which honest history is being attacked, particularly by the presidential administration. The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, universities across the country, PBS — institutions dedicated to telling truthful histories — are all being targeted. That includes Native American history.

I think on one level, in terms of popular culture, there has been a growing reconsideration of the Thanksgiving myth — in large part, because of Native American activism.

I think that myth was beginning to unravel, especially as you saw activism around water defenders and challenging pipeline construction. In recent years there was a renewed understanding that Native people were here before European conquest, resisted our dispossession, and are still here.

“Both African people and Indigenous people were enslaved, trafficked, and forced into servitude by the colonists. That's a key truth the Thanksgiving story erases.”

But we have witnessed a political backlash that insists on a narrative of a white Christian nation that has only done good. You can even see this in Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth doubling down on the Medals of Honor awarded to U.S. soldiers involved in the massacre at Wounded Knee in 1890. The Pentagon had begun a review to officially consider whether the massacre constituted a war crime — but instead of completing that process, we get an insistence by the secretary of defense of maintaining the myth of heroism. That's where we are.

Exactly. And speaking of violence, one of the most horrific parts of U.S. history is the legacy of Indian boarding schools. Recent revelations have uncovered unmarked graves and extensive documentation of abuse, cultural destruction, and genocide. How should these revelations reshape how Americans understand Thanksgiving — not as a moment of harmony, but part of a longer continuum of state policies aimed at erasure and assimilation?

I think it's really important. And when Deb Haaland was head of the Department of the Interior — a Native woman herself who oversaw the Bureau of Indian Affairs — some of that research was made more public. But it's important to understand that boarding schools weren't unique to the U.S. — Canada and several Latin American countries have had more robust public conversations about their own boarding school systems. The United States appears uniquely unwilling to reckon with this history.

Sometimes my students ask the question, “Where is it better to be an Indigenous person? Is it in the United States? Is it in Canada? Is it in Mexico, somewhere else?” I always find the question frustrating, because we have to think about how Indigenous people have navigated forms of colonial violence in all these different countries.

Yet there does seem to be something unique about the United States' inability to reckon with its history of violent dispossession and genocide. Educational institutions in Canada have had a much more robust public conversation about boarding schools. And I think there have been more interesting conversations in Latin American countries around the same things.

“There does seem to be something unique about the United States' inability to reckon with its history of violent dispossession and genocide.”

For most of U.S. history, Native and Black children were never meant to be full subjects in the public education system. They were segregated, exploited, or forcibly assimilated. Boarding schools inflicted sexual violence, cultural destruction, language loss, and the disappearance of children. The United States has a deep inability to confront the reality that its national project depended on Indigenous elimination and exclusion. The Thanksgiving myth is used to try to smooth all that over.

Yes. And in K-12 education, Native Americans are often discussed only in the past tense. Even when violence is acknowledged, it's framed as if Indigenous peoples were completely wiped out. That erases the ongoing settler-colonial project — land theft, water theft, the ongoing crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG). The Trump administration even recently removed the federal report on MMIWG, dismissing it as diversity, equity, and inclusion content. What does that tell you about how the government is not only erasing Indigenous history, but disappearing evidence of ongoing violence?

Even sympathetic teachers who try to narrate this history more honestly sometimes fall into the trap of talking about Native dispossession or genocide as if it were complete — as if we're not here anymore. And I think so many Native people have the experience of being in the classroom and hearing people say that while they're sitting right there, and thinking, “Who am I if we've been entirely erased?”

And yes, the violence is ongoing. I'm speaking to you from what is now Arizona, a place of many Native nations, and there are ongoing fights where mining companies want to take sacred Apache lands for private profit and exploitation. This is not something that ended in the 19th century — it's ongoing in the 21st.

The assault by the Trump administration on honest history is hitting everyone: people working on women's history, public health, Black history, and people working on murdered and missing Indigenous women, which has been one of the most important fights in Indian Country over the last couple decades. If you remove the evidence and documentation, it becomes harder for communities to make claims and fight back. And because the federal government played such a large role in Indigenous dispossession, it has a legal responsibility to address violence against Native women today. Erasing these reports is a way to attempt to avoid that responsibility

I often hear people describe the Trump administration as “unprecedented,” but Indigenous people have lived through the very things many Americans fear today — censorship, repression, family separation, land seizures, forced assimilation. In this moment of rising fascism, what can the country learn from the long Indigenous struggle against occupation and erasure?

I've been having this conversation with friends and family. We should start by acknowledging the real crisis that everyone is facing today. People are right to feel outraged by the attacks on our immigrant neighbors, the separation of families, people being detained arbitrarily by masked men — all of it.

For Native people, as you point out, this isn't as surprising as it is for other people in the country, because we have lived through forms of colonial violence — separation of families, erasure of our history, suppression of language and culture, political repression — for centuries, and we have nevertheless persisted. I think that is a lesson Native people can bring to the contemporary moment.

“Black and Native communities offer to all of society lessons in perseverance, in saying that we have to fight and we will not be defined by our oppressors.”

People of African descent, whose families and ancestors survived slavery, survived the dispossession of their own bodies and labor, have a lot to teach us in this moment too. Black and Native communities offer to all of society lessons in perseverance, in saying that we have to fight and we will not be defined by our oppressors, but by our ability to resist that oppression, by our ability to form bonds of community in contexts of extreme violence, in contexts where the powers that be are bent on our annihilation. We are still here. We have survived. We are here after hundreds of years.That resilience is a wellspring of courage for this moment.

One example of our resilience and resistance comes from boarding schools themselves. Despite the violence, Native children formed new bonds with one another across tribal nations. They came to see themselves not only as Choctaw or Diné or Wampanoag, but as Indigenous people with shared experiences. Many of the young people who later became activists in the 1960s and '70s — especially in the American Indian Movement — first forged those connections in boarding schools.

So even in places designed to destroy Indigenous identity, Native youth created solidarity, political consciousness, and resistance. The Thanksgiving story is often used to obscure this history of Native resistance, but that history is precisely what can help people navigate the current crisis.

Schools have always been a site of oppression and struggle for Native people. From racist mascots to sanitized textbooks to cases like the Choctaw high schooler who was recently banned from wearing regalia in his senior portrait — Indigenous students continue to face erasure and discrimination. How do these practices reflect anti-Indigenous racism, and what changes would you like to see in schools?

During the last decade, Indigenous activists made huge gains in removing racist mascots — in public schools and professional sports. Those were victories earned through generations of organizing. But now we're seeing a backlash. The administration has even pressured the Washington football team to return to its old name. And when I saw the Cleveland baseball team come play in Arizona, I saw fans wearing the old jerseys with the racist caricature.

“Even in places designed to destroy Indigenous identity, Native youth created solidarity, political consciousness, and resistance.”

At the same time, there's increasing Native representation in the media — shows like “Reservation Dogs” or Sterlin Harjo's new one, “The Lowdown.” So there's a contradiction: more representation, but also a resurgence of old racist symbols. Schools need to stand firmly against mascots and stereotypes and instead invite Native people into classrooms to teach from their own cultures, communities, and histories.

Finally, what should replace the sanitized Thanksgiving narrative? And given the backlash, how can teachers tell the truth about Indigenous history while staying as safe as possible, given the attacks on honest educators?

These are dangerous times for educators telling the truth. Teachers need to assess their own situations and do what keeps them safe. But those who have enough security — citizenship, union protection, tenure — should use that privilege to teach the truth.

There are plenty of resources that fit into November's themes without relying on myths. Teachers can focus on the actual Indigenous nations of their region — their histories, their achievements, their contemporary issues. There are two federally recognized Wampanoag tribes near Plymouth itself that people rarely learn about.

And there are Indigenous practices of giving thanks and expressing gratitude that people can learn, like the Haudenosaunee Thanksgiving Address. I've used that address with my own family. One of the beautiful things that Native history and cultural knowledge offer is the notion that we are all in relation with other people and other living beings. That we, as human beings, are in relationship with the earth, the rivers, the oceans, the trees. We have a reciprocal relationship to other living beings around us, including people and the natural world.

That's something to reflect on and to be grateful for and to cultivate a consciousness around. I think those are the kinds of activities that could replace the Thanksgiving myth with something much more truthful — and practices that would help us nurture a better future, not just a more honest reckoning with the past but a more just and kind future.

“We're very aware that things are awful … That means that we're alive, and that we want something different. That's a really important starting point, is just to even have that kind of repulsion and to have that awful feeling about things,” says Tamara Nopper. “So, I want more of that energy, but I want more of that energy to be connected to some more skills.” In this episode of “Movement Memos,” Nopper and host Kelly Hayes discuss the urgency of political education in our current fascist climate, what people are learning in the streets, and the importance of counter-recruiting for movements against policing and deportations.

Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity, and the work of making change. I'm your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. Today, we're going to talk about abolition in practice — how people learn through engagement with state violence, what gets in the way of developing shared analysis, and why abolitionists need to take recruitment and counter-recruitment seriously. We'll be hearing from Tamara K. Nopper. Tamara is a sociologist, writer, educator, and editor. She is the editor of Mariame Kaba's bestselling book We Do This 'Til We Free Us: Abolitionist Organizing and Transforming Justice, and a researcher and writer of several data stories for Colin Kaepernick's Abolition for the People series. Tamara has also created and produced political education lectures on crime data in collaboration with organizations such as the Asian American Writers' Workshop, Haymarket Books, and Interrupting Criminalization. 

I wanted to take this opportunity to talk with Tamara about political education, and the work of challenging our existing ideas — even as we are showing up, exhausted and imperfect, alongside other exhausted and imperfect people — because the violence of our enemies can often outpace our collective understanding, and it's important to ask questions and deepen our analysis.

KH: Tamara Nopper, welcome to “Movement Memos.”

Tamara Nopper: Hi, thanks so much for having me, Kelly.KH: How are you doing today?

TN: I'm exhausted, and everybody's getting on my fucking nerves, but I'm good. Thank you for asking.

KH: We love an honest answer on this show, and I'm sure a lot of people can relate. 

I am sure some of our audience will be familiar with your work, but for the unacquainted, can you tell us a bit about yourself and what you do?  

TN: Sure. I am a researcher, writer, editor, and educator. I'm a sociologist by training. I do a lot of work regarding issues around policing and abolition. I also think a lot about the themes of money, and punishment, and financialization, and a lot about data literacy. So, a lot of my, what I guess you call, public-facing work has to do with thinking about data literacy for organizing, and for kind of political activism. I'm also involved in different labor activism right now, so especially thinking about the impact of everything that's going on politically on higher ed workers, in which I am one of them.

KH: I appreciate the way you've pushed our understanding of data literacy. Our movements need that kind of rigor. 

You wrote something recently on Bluesky about political education that I wanted to explore, because political education is one of my favorite subjects. You said, “Part of the problem of claiming we're politically doing things to enlighten or organize ‘the people' is we can forget that we're part of the people and also need political ed and to be organized.” What kind of political education do you think the left needs most, right now, and how do we need to be organized?

TN: A couple of things. So, thank you for asking me about that. As a professional educator, in terms of being a college professor, but also as somebody who just, I kind of think about things as an educator a lot, whether I'm writing or kind of presenting. And I've done a lot of, as you've mentioned, workshops on data literacy for activists, and anybody who really wants to kind of learn. I often think that there's this kind of discourse about what it means to be “intellectual” or “a voice” or some type of expert.

And I believe in expertise, in the sense of I like people who really study something, and really understand something, and really know it well. But I find that a lot of times the idea is that the “role of the intellectual” or the “role of the researcher” or even the “role of the activist” is this idea that they're there to help enlighten others and organize others. But sometimes, a lot of us really need to also deepen our own understanding of different issues, whether it's issues we talk about, or just the issues that are impacting us. And I think a lot of us also need to know how to actually organize ourselves.

So, I've just been thinking about this a lot, particularly, as I mentioned, thinking about the political moment, what's happening to people who work in higher ed. And a lot of us are kind of used to being the experts on certain topics. And we've done a lot of research, and we might have studied a lot. And I think that work is important as a contribution. But a lot of us don't always know how to organize around our own kind of conditions.

And I've been thinking a lot about, you see these kind of essays or these statements about the role of the “intellectual.” And I believe in intellectualism, I believe in public intellectualism. But I think some of those pieces are written as if the intellectual just floats above, or is extracted from, the material conditions of everybody else. So, it often becomes this idea of, like, the intellectual has to take certain kinds of risk and be in solidarity with “the community.” But intellectuals are also part of the community. They're dealing with exorbitant real estate prices, and high rents, and predatory companies, and extremely expensive utility bills, and environmental dangers, in terms of climate change and the quality of the environment. And they're dealing with policing and political repression.

And so, I've become interested in this question about like, why is the intellectual often depicted as this kind of person removed from these material conditions? And why is the intellectual often depicted as somebody who does things in solidarity with others, but not as part of, and with, others as an impacted person? And I think that this political moment has exposed the limits of thinking about the intellectual that way, because as I'm trying to get involved more in terms of the labor activism regarding my own work conditions, I've just met and encountered many other researchers and faculty members who are accustomed to being the experts on a topic. And they often, sometimes, think that their role as an expert is to kind of be that intellectual, to help others understand the situation. But we're not often equipped to actually organize around our own conditions.

So, if you ask me, what is some of the kind of political ed that I think people who fancy ourselves as leftist radicals, enlightened people, and intellectuals, activists, whatever we call ourselves, right? I think a lot of us, one could get a better handle on the conditions themselves. I think there's various ways to do that. So, I don't think it's only about studying and reading books, but I do think there's a lot about our own literacy regarding conditions that could be useful.

So, I'll give you an example. I think a lot of us have really good critiques of the system, but we're not always that familiar with some of the mechanics or how it's actually organized. I actually think sometimes liberals and reformists are better equipped with just knowing some of the kind of institutional dynamic systems, sometimes because they work within them in a particular way. Maybe it's even because they have faith about them in a particular way.

But I've actually encountered more people that have what I might consider more boring, or milquetoast, politics, who actually have a better handle on kind of how an institution actually operates. And I think that that is important to be able to combine the political critique that I value, and that I think is a hard fought political critique of institutions and structural violence, but to match it with a clear understanding of how these institutions are actually set up, organized, who makes decisions, who pushes the button, right? Because I think it just helps us sometimes with our forms of resistance and our attempts to politically organize against these conditions and to change them.

I also think that a lot of us just need more literacy around actual skill building. I think that a lot of us have really useful critiques. We're very aware that things are awful, even if we don't totally know why they're awful, or the extent to which they're awful. That's a really important starting point, is just to even have that kind of repulsion and to have that awful feeling about things, right? That means that we're alive, and that we want something different. So, I want more of that energy, but I want more of that energy to be connected to some more skills.

So, part of why a lot of times my data literacy lectures have been set up like actual educational lectures, and not necessarily like panels, and this is not to take away from panels, panels are useful, is because I want to be able to really dig deep into unpacking a lot of the mechanics and a lot of the kind of aspects of something like data. And if you look at a lot of the educational material that's available on things like YouTube and TikTok, frankly, it's people with bad politics. But they're the ones who are sometimes taking the time to do educational videos, but they got terrible politics, and they have misinformation, sometimes, and disinformation, right?

And so, I think there's more room for, like, just breaking down certain kinds of material for a broader audience, in a very organized fashion, that's needed. But I also think a lot of us just need more skill building. What do we do with our anger, our rage, our fear, our commitment, our love? What do we do with all these emotions? And what do we do with our understanding of things? But what is the form that we take, right? How do we actually enact that? And I think that requires certain skill building regarding organizing skills.

So, I personally am also trying to brush up on some of that for myself. And I think that that's something I see a lot of other similarly politically minded people also needing when I'm in these spaces with them. I think a lot of us could level up our skills.

KH: This is definitely a moment when all of us need to level up. And I really appreciate what you're saying about how sometimes liberals actually have a better grasp of how certain systems function, in part due to their investment in those systems. I've found that to be true as well, and this is really a time to identify and bridge the gaps in our strategic knowledge. 

I've been really heartened by the political education efforts that have been underway here in Chicago. I remember one weekend, I was putting on a big base-building training, and I expected a low turnout, because there was another important training that I knew hundreds of people were going to attend that day, but the room actually wound up being so crowded that we needed to bring in more chairs. And when it comes to ICE watch, Know Your Rights, and community defense trainings, we've routinely seen hundreds of people showing up in-person, and a thousand or more at a time showing up virtually, every time there's a training. It's been incredible, and I am really encouraged by that participation, because it indicates that people are feeling the urgency of the moment and responding by seeking knowledge, and that's so crucial. 

And we're really fortunate here to be the beneficiaries of the long-term labor some people and groups have put into the strategies and analysis that are being shared with us. Groups like the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights and Organized Communities Against Deportation, which have gamed out what it means to resist ICE through engagement with the municipal system, and what state laws are in play, and how all of that affects how we move on the ground, and what our options are. I've been really grateful for the scope and scale of the work that's been happening.

It's also making me feel very awake to new possibilities, in terms of what mass participation in political education can look like in this political moment. 

TN: That's wonderful. I'm so glad to hear that. And I think that that is such an important contribution to the political struggle. So, yeah, I'm really happy to hear that that's happening in Chicago.

KH: And speaking of what we're going through here in Chicago, as you know, over the past couple of months, we have experienced a massive surge in arrests and violence perpetrated by ICE, and other federal agents operating under the banner of “Operation Midway Blitz.” You've characterized these actions as “a form of a federal government takeover of cities for the purpose of policing.” Can you say more about the sprawling presence of ICE as a form of authoritarian policing?

TN: Okay. So, a couple of things I want to kind of… Thank you for asking that. And I want to kind of take a step back before I get right to that question, but it's connected to it. The reason why I think it's really important to talk about, one, it's a federal takeover, but to be more specific about what that federal takeover is doing, is because in some cases, federal takeovers are good. And I think that that's getting lost in this moment in some ways.

So I've seen people sometimes say, “This is a form of the Civil War,” and use that as a way to kind of challenge what's happening with President Trump and the federal takeover. I actually think that's kind of a dangerous framing. I had actually posted that, and I thought about it, and I was like, “Bitch, why are you posting this?” And I deleted my post. And the reason why is because we actually needed a Civil War, because the Civil War was about, even with all the fuckery of Abraham Lincoln's presidency and his racism, it was an effort to stop the spread of slavery in different states.

If you think about things like reconstruction, that was a federal takeover. The majority of times where the military has been involved in urban areas is usually for racist, fucked-up things like repressing urban rebellions. The historian Elizabeth Hinton has talked about this in her work.

So, there's all these awful things that the federal government has done. But in many cases, we actually need a federal government takeover because of how racist, how segregationist, and how reactionary a lot of the politics have been at different states, and not just at the government level of states, but at the public level of racist residents. So, if you think about it, in some cases, the federal government sent in the National Guard to escort people to segregated schools because white people just didn't even want black students going to the school.

And I think the reason I bring this up is, it's important in this moment, I think, to sort out the difference between when has the federal government intervened and taken over in ways that were necessary, because of how racist, and segregationist, and discriminatory state governments or its residents were. And if we think about certain decisions of the Supreme Court, like gay marriage and so forth, right, interracial marriage, those could be seen as examples of the federal government kind of imposing itself. We need things like that sometimes, right?

But in this case, what is the function of the federal government? So, I think the question becomes, when a federal government decides to take over, and encroach on the jurisdiction of a state, what is the function of that? What is the purpose?

The purpose now is authoritarianism. It's a way of maintaining power and control. It's a way of making people have deference to the current administration. It's a way of flexing muscle. It's a way of enacting just fear and terror. It's a way of maintaining a white supremacist state. It's a way of extracting time, labor, resources, energy away from what could be more positive activities towards just self-defense or community defense.

And so, clearly, we need to condemn this federal government takeover for all those things. But I think we need to be very specific about what is happening with that, because what's happened is some people just see it as kind of a state's rights discussion. And, a lot of times, that's an assumption that the states inherently are good, or equal, about equality, or that they have an agenda that serves people. And it doesn't always do that, right? So, there's that.

But I think, in that case, we have to think about things like ICE. ICE is a part of the Department of Homeland Security, which is a federal government agency that was created after 9/11. ICE is something that took over kind of the functions of, let's say, the Immigration and Naturalization Service. So, a lot of people of certain generations don't even have never even heard of the term INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service]. So, you hear people say, “Oh, ICE is kind of fairly new, get rid of it.” I get the point, and I do think we should abolish ICE. But it's not just abolishing ICE, because it's only a couple decades old. It's whatever iteration before and after ICE that needs to be abolished. It's the function that needs to be abolished.

And I think that's part of it, but that is part of the federal government takeovers. You're using federal government workers, which ICE is, to basically take over states, and to enact terror and violence, and kidnapping people, and really just doing just terrible things.

KH: I appreciate what you're raising about the argument that ICE is a relatively new entity. That framing has always landed awkwardly with me, because when I was growing up, immigrant communities were terrorized by INS agents — and the INS was eventually dismantled, but it was dismantled to facilitate the creation of a less “bureaucratic,” more “national security” focused apparatus. And before INS was created in 1933, immigrant communities were being targeted by federal immigration agents under the Bureau of Immigration and by the U.S. Border Patrol, which was founded in 1924 and immediately became a racialized purveyor of extreme violence. And of course, immigrants have long been terrorized by local police — and we know that the control of immigrant populations drove the evolution of policing in some parts of the United States. So, when we get very restrictive in our analysis, around department names, or what's only been going on for two or three decades, we don't really have the analysis we need to ask the right questions or make the right demands. 

Which reminds me of the hyper focus on whether or not Trump will deploy troops in particular cities, including mine. There was a moment when the national media was very focused on the question of whether Trump would deploy troops here, in Chicago, and when it became clear that wasn't happening right away, the national media dropped the story — and a lot of people declared that J.B. Pritzker and the state of Illinois had won. Meanwhile, we had hundreds of federal agents unleashed on our city, neighborhoods across the city tear-gassed, and the federal government claiming to have abducted more than 3,000 immigrants. We've seen some of our local economies devastated, and communities utterly terrorized — and yet one form of militarized action holds a place in the popular political imagination that the other does not, as though some red line hasn't been crossed yet, when in my opinion, it well and truly has.

TN: Yeah, and I think that was some of the dangers of the discourse regarding Washington, D.C. So, on one hand, and I remember being on the Women's March panel with you, where you were trying to emphasize that, just focusing on military being deployed, or military personnel being deployed, loses sometimes the plot. And I think that that's part of what's important, is that I think it's about trying to understand different levels of specificity. 

So, what we're seeing is, we're seeing kind of different levels of people who work on behalf of the government, whether it's federal, local, who play different roles. And some of them are having political battles with each other over jurisdiction. So, there's debates about federalism and what's the federal government's kind of role. Sometimes, there's conflicts between local law enforcement and ICE. Sometimes, there's cooperation. Some of that cooperation has been institutionalized through things like 287(g) Programs, or it's been supposedly kind of separated in terms of certain distinctions with things like sanctuary cities, right? These are all formal kind of government programs.

So, this debate about what is the jurisdiction, what is not, that's important to an extent, but that debate can also lose the plot too. So, what happens is, people can get caught up in saying, “We just don't need the military in the city.” You saw a lot of people, for example, some of them who are Chicago folks, saying that, “We don't need the military in this city,” or, “We don't need certain types of police in the city,” but they're very pro-policing.

And so, if your only critique is that we just don't need these entities in the city to do policing, but you're not anti-policing, you're losing the plot. It means that you aren't really dealing with what is happening, is you have people who work for the government, are seen as enforcing “the law,” even though we should interrogate what that is, and it's ever-changing kind of use and targeting, but they see themselves as enforcing the law in some ways. And in doing so, they're ripping families apart. They're causing just tremendous pain and suffering and fear. And they're just changing life on such a large scale and at such a rapid pace these days.

So, we can say, “Get the military out of here,” but that doesn't deal with the fact that the ICE is not the military. Or you have local law enforcement who might say, “We're not going to cooperate with ICE,” but that doesn't mean local law enforcement isn't going to still… They could still be racially profiling, and targeting, and stopping, and frisking, and beating, and abusing, and killing people too.

And so, we have to think about the difference between understanding that there can be a shared goal among these government entities. And that, sometimes, what they're fighting over is jurisdiction over who has dominion, right? Who has dominion to be able to do these things?

So, just very quickly, Ida B. Wells-Barnett spent a large portion of her, unfortunately, very short life in Chicago. And she's been honored by different people in Chicago, and her legacy is very much part of Chicago. And one of the things that she really helped me understand, when I was reading her, was that she would talk about lynching as extrajudicial violence outside of the criminal legal system. But she also understood that extrajudicial lynching, it was a battle over dominion a lot of times. It was who's going to be allowed to basically enact the death penalty against somebody. Will it be the legal system, or will it be a bunch of vigilant entities in the mob, right?

So, they didn't have, always, opposing goals. They just fought over who had dominion. And I think that's what's happening right now, is you have a lot of different legal entities, government entities, they're involved in the captive… What are their jobs? It's to capture people. It's to put them into custody. And it's to put them into some type of custody that, basically, they're held against their will as punishment. And they're vulnerable to other forms of violence in the process, and other forms of violence that often get legally permitted, or socially permitted, or both.

And I think that it's really a battle over dominion and thinking that it's just a problem of, “Oh, this entity is here versus that entity.” It's not a competition between the entities, per se. And if we start to think about it as such, we lose the plot.

KH: What you're saying makes me think about the connection between stop and frisk and the so-called “Kavanaugh stops” of immigrants that we are seeing, that are wholly based on profiling, and how you really can't separate the evolution of what the violence of policing looks like into convenient categories. What we allow one group to experience will always be further operationalized and deployed according to the interests of those in power. 

But people get confused by notions of who they perceive to be guilty or innocent, or what they believe will apply to them, or who they think is on their side. That's something we've encountered here in Chicago, with so many newly activated folks in the streets. It's incredibly heartening, and it is absolutely necessary, but the number of people who are joining ICE patrol and rapid response in this moment — the sheer volume means that we have a lot of people who haven't spent a lot of time analyzing the nature and harms of policing working alongside people who have. And it means we wind up hearing people ask why we can't call the police when ICE is doing this or that, or insisting that the police are on our side, because the cops here are usually abiding by state law and not openly assisting ICE. 

I mean, we really have people here who believe that the Chicago police are part of some moral alliance against ICE, which is just absurd. The work we're actually doing, ICE watch, as it exists in Chicago, evolved out of cop watching. It is built on that lineage, the legacy and the lessons of cop watching, which comes from the Black Panthers and the Black liberation movement. So, I am hoping we can work toward an evolving understanding of the fundamental threats our neighbors face, from all forms of policing, and really bring this culture of vigilance full circle.

TN: Yeah, I'll be honest. One of the things I've been thinking a lot about lately is, on one hand, I'm just extremely inspired by the level of opposition to what ICE is doing, whether it's people showing up for these trainings, whether they're veteran activists, or people who are kind of newly activated. I mean, it's just really breathtaking to see the level of disgust, the level of risk that people are willing to take, these confrontations they're having with ICE agents, the whistles, the kind of coming out of their houses, the things they're trying to organize to kind of warn people. And so, from highly organized to kind of newly organized and newly activated, it's just really breathtaking, and it's really inspiring.

At the same time, I've been wondering what it means for abolition. And I don't know if it's actually taking a step back. I've been thinking about this, because there's a lot of ways where part of what was happening in the immigrant rights movement was an effort to kind of challenge the idea of the good immigrant versus bad immigrant, is about trying to make inroads to the immigrant rights movement regarding a lack of consideration about abolition, in terms of people have been targeted through the criminal justice system. These were hard-fought kind of battles.

I mean, I was in immigrant rights spaces, where you had these separations, and you still do, where people would say, “Well, these immigrants didn't commit crimes. These are innocent immigrants.” And wanting to kind of debate the difference between an immigration offense versus a crime that would get you a felony conviction. And those were hard-fought battles, and they are still going on in immigrant rights spaces.

And there's even been questions about have immigrant rights activists kind of co-opted some of the aspects of abolition. So, you also see the discourse of crimmigration in the legal scholarship, and in some of the activism, where people are saying how are immigrants getting criminalized, or so forth. And on one hand, there's a needed usefulness to the flexibility regarding the language of criminalization, right? It can be something that gets a lot of people to oppose certain things. It can be a basis of getting more people to try to rescue and save people from the jaws of this bullshit, and the structural violence. These are all things we need, right? We need more people activated to kind of think about those things.

But at the same time, and I don't have the answers for it right now, we're still very much relying on kind of discourses of innocence. We're still very much relying on kind of going to make sure that “good,” or “innocent,” or “hardworking” people can also be rounded up. And it's true, everybody can be rounded up, right? So, there are variations in terms of people's kind of stuff going on, right?

But there's ways where I've wondered, on one hand, we need self-defense right now. We need people activated. We need kind of just freeing people by any means necessary, frankly, with what's going on, and the level of aggression, chaos, and ramping up, and just a number of incidents that are happening right now against people. So, we need all of this activation.

But I do wonder what will happen. And I think there's going to be a lot of recovery work that the abolitionist movement is going to have to do, because in our attempts to rightly defend people, particularly immigrants right now, we're relying on a lot of these discourses of innocence, and about exceptionalism, and so forth. And we're kind of losing which direction to look from.

I've been thinking a lot about like, we often use these frameworks of like, “Okay, it happened to this group, it can happen to you,” and usually talk about like a so-called “respectable group,” and say, “If it can happen to a citizen, it can happen to you.” But really, it's, if it can happen to somebody at the bottom, it can always move upward. The target can always expand, right?

If you have a concept of a criminal, you can just keep expanding what is a crime. And it can always move upward. But we haven't been really encouraged to think about it that way, a lot of times, in our discourses, or even if we have been encouraged to think about it, the way, in real time, we try to get attention and support for people. And we should try to get attention and support for people and try to defend them. But the way we often do it in real time is to kind of start from the respectable, and say, “Oh…” And we actually re-entrenched the concept of “the criminal.”

And there are just a lot of people who, unfortunately, are rightly outraged at what ICE is doing, but they're partly outraged at what ICE is doing, because they see the people being targeted by ICE as distinct from the so-called criminals, and frankly, a lot of times from Black people, even though obviously ICE is targeting Black people too, right? And it always has been, and is definitely doing so now.

But there's a way where being able to kind of separate out, or say, “These people are different from these people.” There's always a specter of anti-Blackness. There's always a specter of criminality. And because we aren't really challenging, sometimes, just criminalization and the criminal punishment system and law enforcement, it means that sometimes we look at all these things as exceptions. And then, we also exceptionalize kind of people are being targeted that we do need to rescue. And we forget about both the existing logic that made these targets kind of possible now in this moment. But we also forget the people who've been targeted, and who are engaged, or who are still going through hell.

KH: As an abolitionist, I see a lot of opportunity in what's happening. Thousands and thousands of people across Chicago have attended ICE Watch and rapid response trainings. And embedded in all of those trainings is the rule that we don't call the police. People are being taught to respond to emergencies without calling the cops, because the cops aren't going to help, and bringing them to the scene introduces another threat to vulnerable people. 

Now, that's foreign to a lot of these newly activated people, especially folks who show up in the heat of the moment, without having attended a training, but even to some of the people who've been trained, it's a jarring deviation from something that's reflexive for them. But they are showing up, and they aren't calling the cops, and they're working in concert with their neighbors on the ground to create as much safety and justice as they can, at the community level. That is the work of abolition, regardless of whether people have a fully formed analysis, or what they call it — it's the work of building other ways of living and doing, in real time. I am so heartened by that, and I see so much potential in it. And I am honestly more heartened by people showing up to do that kind of work, even if they don't call themselves abolitionists, than I am by people who speak the language of abolition fluently, but aren't doing anything to rehearse the values they're talking about — and I think we've all seen a lot of that. 

I also think a lot of people learn through engagement with these systems. Like the people who've been getting brutalized by the state police at the Broadview ICE facility. For a while, it was federal agents brutalizing and gassing us outside that facility. For weeks now, it's been the state police, who Governor J.B. Pritzker insisted were being deployed there to protect protesters. He still says that. And yet, people are seeing and experiencing the brutality of those police on the ground. Most of the major movement moments I've been a part of have included some white people who came in seeing the police one way, and learned, through experience, that the police aren't what they thought they were, and I don't believe this moment is going to be an exception in that way. For me, the ongoing question is how we are going to meet people in those moments and what kind of analysis, understanding, and invitations we're going to extend.

People are taking radical actions that they've never taken before — in some cases, doing things they never imagined they would do. I've had people tell me this, that they never imagined they would do these things. They're doing those things to protect people from law enforcement — and they're helping each other, and learning from each other while they do it. When people are willing to fracture their relationship with the status quo to this degree, I think there's a lot that's up for grabs. People are willing to learn, think, act, and strategize in ways they haven't before. That's a huge opportunity. And I think it's incumbent upon us to seize that opportunity, and see what we can make of it.

I think there's a lot of work to do. Like when someone says, we can't call these kidnappings “arrests,” because arrest implies that someone did something wrong and that they are going to receive due process, when being arrested in the United States by your local police doesn't imply either of those things. Often, it just means that you were Black in the eye line of a cop when a particular impulse struck him. And even when we are “guilty” of a thing, we need to trouble a lot of notions of what kind of violence that justifies and who it empowers — which is why I tend to use the words “arrest” and “kidnapping” interchangeably when I talk about what ICE is doing. I think what you're raising is important, and I am definitely seizing opportunities to have those conversations right now, because I think those opportunities are deeply important.

And on the subject of opportunities, and figuring out how to meet the moment, the recent escalations we're seeing from ICE are occurring in a moment of mass expansion, amid a major recruiting boom for the agency. Notably, there hasn't been a major leftist counter recruiting campaign organized around this. You've noted that, unlike the anti-war movement, prison and police abolitionists have failed to prioritize counter recruitment. What do you think abolitionists can learn from the anti-war movement in this regard?

TN: So, I used to volunteer for years for the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors, which was an anti-war, peace organization that existed for about 60 years, and they folded in the 2000s. And they came out of organizing, regarding the draft, in trying to help people with draft resistance.

But it's in 1973 that President Nixon gets rid of the draft. And so, it becomes what is known as the all-volunteer force. And this is something where you start to see, one, just some changes in kind of like what would be considered military benefit. So, if you look at it, it turns into all-volunteer force. It gets rid of a draft. On one hand, that's a good thing, right? People aren't forced to be in the military in the same way. But what it does is, it also kind of plays, it challenges some of the resistance strategies, because there was a certain amount of opposition to the draft, and organized resistance to the draft, and organized resistance that came with a lot of penalties.

There's more scholarship being done about how different anti-colonial organizations, civil rights groups — a lot of people of color went to prison, because they refused to serve in the military during the draft. And so, there's just a lot of really important work that still needs to be done to bring more of that history to the surface.

But when it turned into all-volunteer force, it basically becomes kind of a job program. And one of the things that, when we think about it, being a service member is a government job. The Department of Defense, which houses the military, is [one of] the largest employer[s] in the world. I mean, in the world. And so, a good portion of just people who are employed in the United States, but who also are government workers, or public workers, work for the military.

And if you look at the military, the starting wages aren't that great. And I'm not necessarily advocating that they should get better wages. But they often get a lot of what we might consider benefits, but these are kind of employee benefits. One of the things I didn't mention when I introduced myself is some of my research is kind of increasingly about employee benefits, and thinking about the role of employee benefits as a form of labor control. Employers kind of give more and more benefits. Some of them that are not even legally required for them to do. But what is the function of giving employees more and more benefits?

It kind of takes the function of government, instead of having social services and programs just be freely available from the government, which they should be. They sometimes are offered through different ways, through kind of an employer-sponsored benefit, but also becomes a way of sometimes maintaining certain control. So, what you see is, you see this transition to all-volunteer force. You also see just kind of a ratcheting up of a military benefit.

So, the historian Jennifer Mittelstadt, and I hope I'm pronouncing their name correctly, has written about the military welfare state, and just like how large it is, and how much funding it goes into. But it creates this kind of major welfare state, not just only for service members, but also for their families in a particular way. And that's kind of some of the ways that it also becomes a recruitment tool. And so, when you turn to the all-volunteer force, you got to try to recruit people. And you often recruit them by talking about the job and job benefits. But you also use discourses about like honor, status, service, and so forth.

These are some of the same ways that people try to recruit people into ICE. And so, if you look at ICE's website and some of the recruitment, it's about like, “Here's what you can start with. Here's the starting salary. Here's the benefits and the bonuses that you can get.” So, it's all this kind of job recruitment stuff. But also, part of the way that they kind of market things like ICE, or law enforcement, or the military, is about honor and status.

And there's also a particular racial history to a lot of this stuff. So, for example, the military has been marketed as a way for, like President Lyndon Johnson, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the infamous Department of Labor Secretary who wrote the Moynihan Report, right? They would promote military service as a way for Black communities to become “disciplined” socially. So, it was seen as like both like a way to kind of get Black people to stop protesting so much. But it was also very much this fucked up racist discourse about like, “Oh, if Black people get in the military, they'll stop being so kind of culturally deviant in their behavior. It will get better.” And that will supposedly lead to better community outcomes.

So, there's also particular ways that these jobs get marketed by the military law enforcement, including ICE, towards particular communities, as kind of basically like, “Oh, you're a minority community, and this will help you get your shit together, and help you bring honor to your community.” And, in a racist society, where you're constantly being told you're pathological, deviant, have bad behavior, and racistly being blamed for your own social outcomes as a group, that shit is really appealing to some people. And you do have people that see a lot of honor in serving in some of these jobs.

But I think what we need to understand as abolitionists is these are marketed as jobs. And it's not the only way in which these positions have appeal to some people, but they are marketed as jobs with salaries, employee benefits, and so forth. And if you think about the fact that this economy is even worse in the toilet, and just the cost of living, that is often seen. And student debt is really high. All these things, right? Those are often very useful things for job recruiters who are trying to recruit more people into certain jobs.

KH: Some leftists argue that police and soldiers are agents of class repression, and are not workers. You've argued that this characterization romanticizes work, and ignores the fact that many jobs are bound up in carcerality and war. How can viewing police, and members of the military, as workers, help us form a more strategic analysis?

TN: Yeah, I've been saying for a couple of years now that I think more abolitionists and critics of policing need to deal with the fact that police are workers. And I have gotten this resistance to that from a lot of different people, actually, who will say what you're saying, “Well, they're not workers because their job is to protect capital, or to cause harm to the labor movement.” Or I've had people say, “Well, we don't want them in unions. And I don't consider them a union sibling,” and so forth. And I get all of those critiques.

But part of it is, the main way in which a lot of people are being recruited to do this work is as a job, and also more specifically government workers. And I keep stressing that they're government workers, because I'm somebody who believes in needing a government. I think that we need to have an apparatus that provides public goods and services, and that also has certain policies for the public good.

So, I might be different than somebody else who might say, “We don't need government,” or who assumes that the state can only be about violence. I don't assume that the state's only function can be violence. I understand that, unfortunately, a large portion of the state's function, as well as what it puts its funding and policies towards, is towards violence. So, what I would like is a government where government work has to be reimagined to be work that serves the public welfare, and the health, and the well-being of people. It also means, then, having to reimagine things like public safety, and so forth, right?

And so, one of the things is, the reason why I think more leftist and abolitionists need to deal with this is because if we just say, “We're going to ignore you as workers,” we're missing a big part of how people actually end up in those positions in the first place. They are heavily recruited. There's a lot of money.

When I used to work, or volunteer, for CCCO, we would talk about just the sheer amount of money and kind of cultural efforts into recruitment. There was just so much recruitment. And I volunteered with one of the programs at CCCO, it was the counter-military recruitment. And it was about how do you actually try to encourage people not to take the job of a service member, right? Well, that means we have to think about why would that job be appealing? And we used to talk about the concept of a poverty draft. Who does the military tend to recruit?

We were a little off base sometimes, because the military also recruits a lot of other people who are not in poverty, per se, like people to be officers, and so forth, right? But we're trying to get at the point that, a lot of times, the military is selling you the promise of a job. What that means is, a lot of us who want to think about counter-recruitment, right, we have to kind of first think about what's attracting you to that position.

Some of it is not only a job. There are people who are attracted, unfortunately, to certain work, because they get off on being violent, or they get off on the idea of being able to capture people, or because they're racist, right? So, there's a lot of things that attract people to certain types of work that you also have to politically work against. But a big function of how they even get into those positions is because they're hired to be employees.

So, I think just on a very logistical level, there's that. I think that this assumption that all workers are kind of good people, or that work is inherently good, I think we need to challenge that. So, there's this idea that you're speaking against the sanctity of work, or labor, if you call police workers. I don't assume that work and labor is sacred, right? I think that there's work that needs to be valued. I think that there's work that's exploited. I think that there's work that also needs to be questioned.

And so, this idea of… That's a labor… No shade. I believe in Labor Day. I understand the whole history of it getting kind of sanitized, right? I understand why people celebrate Labor Day, and I understand why people celebrate workers and unions, right? But there's a certain discourse of Labor Day that plays out with how we talk about police and law enforcement as workers. It's this idea that Labor Day has a kind of discourse of like, all laborer is sacred, and that's just meaningful, and that work is inherently good, and workers are good.

That's not true. There is a lot of what is considered violence work, and I'm using the phrase by Micol Seigel, and I hope I'm pronouncing their name correctly, but they have a book called Violence Work: State Power and the Limits of Police, and their definition of violence workers are people whose work rests on the premise and promise of violence. And the reality is a lot of the economy is built on violence work.

So, if we think about the concept of prison-industrial complex, there's competing definitions that people provided. But one of the things that I really appreciate about Ruth Wilson Gilmore, she was asked by Daniel Denver about her definition of the prison-industrial complex. And she gave a very detailed one, but she was talking about different labor and work that's done. And one of the things that she and her partner, and co-author, Craig Gilmore, talked about is, they said one of the problems of how people of conceptualized prison-industrial complex is they associate industrial with profit, and that we miss all of the different kind of socio-economic processes that actually play out that lead to profit, but we also miss the role of the state in all of this, and how it's connected to the economy.

And so, when we start to understand that a lot of these people working in law enforcement and the military are government workers, it means we bring into focus more how the economy is actually organized, and what role the state plays in its organization, and what are big functions of government jobs. So, again, I believe in government, I just think that the work of government needs to lean less towards violence work, and less towards carcerality and militarization, and more towards things that speak to the humanity of people, try to enrich and kind of lengthen people's lives, to increase the quality of life, instead of threatening the quality of life and inflicting violence.

And I think that what happens is this assumption that all workers need to be unionized, I think we need to question that. I see people say, I posted this myself, but I don't know if I totally believe it, things like, if you have a boss, you need a union. I don't know if that's true. Do we want all workers, paid workers, to be well organized, to become a political force? Well, the only way you can say that is if you think all the work is good.

But if you start to think about some of the workers, and what does their job actually help do in the world, right, what is the work that their work does, you have to start saying like, some of these workers might not be the ones we want well organized. And so, it means also having to challenge our kind of association with labor unions with work. I believe in labor unions. I'm a member of a labor union. I'm active with my labor union, right? But I believe that we have to rethink everybody being unionized, because do you want all paid workers to be organized? The only way you could come to that conclusion is if you think all paid workers are doing good work in the world, right? And I think we have to question that.

The other thing is, you can support capital and still be a paid worker. This idea that you're a paid worker, and that you have inherently good politics as an individual, or the job you're doing really misses, again, how the economy is organized and how a lot of it is organized around carceral work, right? If you think about just the sheer number of people who work for the Department of Homeland Security, which houses ICE, the Department of Homeland Security has over 260,000 employees, right? Carceral industries are some of the most unionized, and I'm including people who are correctional officers, law enforcement, right?

And I'll just say this, this idea of the police not being members of labor unions, one of the things that I think we also need to think about about challenging police officers as workers, and why it's useful, are abolitionists. Abolitionists talk a lot about budgets, and what we actually like spending to go towards. That doesn't mean we're always as versed in how budgeting works. I do think a lot more abolitionists, including myself, need to become more familiar with things like collective bargaining, and contract negotiations, and city planning, and budgets, because that's a big part of what determines what type of public services we're going to have, and where it tilts, in terms of like the type of work that government work and services offers us, right? And a large portion that goes to law enforcement right now.

Well, one of the things is that police officers are highly organized as a political force. We often think about those police officers being organized through things like the fraternal order of police, but we don't always focus as much on, like, the units that are involved in collective bargaining. And so, Fraternal Order of Police is a powerful institution, but they aren't involved in the collective bargaining in the way that, let's say, a local union chapter is. And it was after the urban rebellions that like, you start seeing more and more police officers kind of getting into collective bargaining. And that is a big part of how city budgets are swallowed up by law enforcement, is through the collective bargaining, right?

I would just recommend, for example, one author, is Ayesha Bell Hardaway. Professor Bell Hardaway is a law professor, and she wrote an article called the “Rise of Police Unions on the Back of the Black Liberation Movement.” And so, I highly recommend Ayesha Bell Hardaway's work, because she maps out how, in opposition to the Black liberation movement, you have the rise of police labor organizing. And that's been a pretty well-covered topic. But she really gets into some of the stuff regarding the collective bargaining units that emerge out of that.

And so, that's another reason why I think we need to kind of deal with the fact that police are workers, is part of the way that they organize and take up a large part of the budget is through unionization and collective bargaining. And they do that as workers, right?

So, just to recap, I don't think police and law enforcement, I'm not saying to unionize them, I'm not saying to lose the plot about what their function is politically in society, in terms of their function being to protect capital and white supremacy. I'm not saying to lose any of that insight, but it is to say, if you want to try to kind of target them as a force, you got to deal with part of the ways in which they're able to kind of do that. And that's as workers and as an organized workforce.

It also means, how do you get people to try to resist policing? While part of resisting policing is also encouraging people to, what does it mean to kind of see policing as a job? It's a very attractive job for some people, right? It's also something that there's more and more work to get policing professionalized. So, if you look at the history of police academies, if you look at the history of the development of criminal justice studies programs, if you look at the history of certain policing reforms, if you look at the history of crime data, if you look at the history of accreditation of policing, right? All of these are forms of police professionalization that is also part of the carceral economy. People make money professionalizing the police.

So, you have many people participating in the economy, some of them who are not in law enforcement, who are going to be pro-police as workers, partly because that's also part of how they make money and become kind of an institutional force. So, there's many layers of how to kind of dismantle this. And one angle is not the only angle, is to deal with the fact that they're workers, and that's how people end up a lot of times in the position of it.

And what would it mean to have a counter recruitment kind of process, or activism, towards law enforcement, the way that peace and justice groups had towards the military, in terms of counter military recruitment? Well, the first step would be just to recognize that police are workers. If you just say, “Well, I don't even think of them as workers,” you're probably not going to do much to try to counter recruit them from becoming police officers.

KH: I am really interested in this argument. I'm someone who's previously accepted and subscribed to the argument that police aren't workers, but I was also eager to interrogate it when I saw you speaking to the subject on social media. And I do find your arguments compelling.

We know that not all workers produce surplus value with their work, some facilitate the process of value becoming profit, and some maintain the conditions that make production, distribution and profit possible. We know that elements of the working class can be reactionary or counter revolutionary. I can see how stripping them of the status of worker might obscure a contradiction that needs to be explored.

I will say that I don't think I've ever heard anyone I'm in community with argue that being a worker imbues people with good politics, but I know some people believe that there is political potential and the basis for solidarity in and among people who share the status of worker. But I would agree that there are workers, well outside law enforcement, whose work is geared toward the control, abuse and exploitation of other people, in ways that I don't think can be redeemed. So, are there simply workers with whom we shouldn't be in solidarity, who we shouldn't want in unions? And are police among those workers? That's something I am going to continue to think about, and I would love to dig deeper, but unfortunately, we are running out of time. 

So, as we're winding things down, Tamara, is there anything else you would like to share with, or ask of the audience today?

TN: I would just end with saying, I think that, as we're kind of experimenting, which I love, I love that people are doing the things that you're talking about. I think that some of these experiments are also based in people who've been organizing for a long time, where it's an opportunity for them to think through some of these things.

So, when you were talking about with some of these anti-ICE trainings, and part of it being like, “We don't call the police,” right? That comes out of a lot of hard work, a lot of hard work in terms of analysis, a lot of hard work in terms of experimentation, a lot of hard work in terms of conversations, and kind of thinking through these things. And a lot of hard work of activists, and organizers, and organizations that some of them are no longer with us, that helped plant those seeds in the work they were doing, and that we might have learned about, or participate in.

And so, I think it's really exciting that that's happening. I think along with that happening, I think that we need to always balance experimentation with deep study, and with just getting clearer in what we're dealing with, and to figure out what to do with that clarity, right? We don't want to all turn into a bunch of consultants, or where we think that, “Oh, now we have like the research and the clarity, and now we're going to kind of use that to try to forestall political imagination and experiment.” So, I think it's a really delicate balance. I haven't totally figured that out yet, but I do think there's always room for us to have a better, deeper understanding of what we're dealing with, to not see study and political analysis as contradictory to the experimentation, to organizing, and to activation.

I don't think I'm the only one who thinks that. So, I don't want to say it's an original thought, but I would say that that's kind of the stuff I'm trying to balance in the world. And I have a feeling maybe some other people are trying to as well.

KH: I appreciate the shout out to people whose hard work has helped frame this moment of mass activation and experimentation. In Chicago, organizers with groups like the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights and Organized Communities Against Deportations, who have worked for years to limit ICE's reach in Illinois and Chicago — which has included fighting for protections for criminalized immigrants — these folks always acknowledge the lineages of Black struggle and the many decades of immigrant rights work that inform their efforts. And building upon that organizing, neighborhood groups like Protect Rogers Park, which started creating its community infrastructure back in 2017, have become touchstones for community defense projects that have sprung up over the last couple of months. And now, in a moment whenICE is scaling down its efforts in Chicago, over the winter, and attacking people in warmer cities, I hope we will take Tamara's advice and use this time to deepen our analysis and sharpen our skills. Of course, there will still be ICE attacks in Chicago. That violence was occurring before Operation Midway Blitz, and it will continue to occur. But as the constant alerts die down, we may have a moment on our hands to take a breath, regroup, learn together, and prepare together for what's ahead. 

In our next episode, we'll talk a bit about what we've learned so far, from what's happened in Chicago, over the last couple of months, in the hopes that our experiences here might be useful to people who are now being flung into the same situation – or soon will be.

Tamara, I want to thank you so much for joining me today. I really appreciate the opportunity to hear your perspective. And I think people are just going to learn so much from it.

TN: Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

KH: I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I'll see you in the streets.

Born of crisis but torn by years of tensions among its members, the group of 20 major economies scored a rare victory for multilateralism after overcoming the boycott and objections of its most powerful member, the US.

South Africa, this year's G20 president, rallied all but two member nations — the US and Argentina — to issue a declaration, ignoring Washington's warnings and quelling questions about the G20's future — at least for now. 

Many doubted Pretoria would secure a declaration, much less tackle issues such as helping poor nations cope with climate change and external debt.

That success strengthened a body which for years was struggling to reach meaningful agreements, and highlighted the power of multilateralism when it seemed in retreat, researchers and delegates said.

The outcome infuriated the US, next year's G20 host. The White House accused South Africa of weaponizing its presidency to undermine the G20's founding principles on unanimous consensus. 

US President Donald Trump would restore its “legitimacy” while hosting next year, it said. 

The White House had no immediate comment when asked if it planned to disinvite South Africa from next year's G20 events.

The declaration's final paragraph was carefully worded to commit to meeting in future G20 summits in the UK and South Korea, but only to “working together” under the US presidency, a South African delegate said. 

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa declined a US offer to hand over the rotating G20 presidency to a junior diplomat. That ceremony took place between equivalent diplomats this week. 

The summit had seemed hopelessly overshadowed by Trump's boycott over false allegations that South Africa's black majority government mistreats its white minority.

A South African delegate at the summit, who declined to be named, because they were not authorized to speak, said the agreement on a draft caused a visible ripple of relief among negotiators.

“News of the G20's demise is greatly exaggerated,” said Josh Lipsky, the Atlantic Council's international economics chair and ex-aide to former US president Barack Obama.

“In a crisis ... it will be there — regardless of which leaders are present at any ... summit,” he said. The declaration tackled issues such as climate and renewable energy that often divide G20 members. It proposed the first global panel to address inequality.

“This is the first meeting of world leaders ... which put the inequality emergency at the center of the international agenda,” Oxfam economic justice senior director Nabil Ahmed said.

Faced with Trump's ire, G20 leaders had a choice: “Do we butter him up or stand up to him?” Atlantic Council Eurasia Center nonresident senior fellow Michael Bociurkiw said. They chose the latter.

“Leaders were getting fed up,” he said. 

“This could set a new approach to dealing with Donald Trump,” he added, a view several delegates echoed.

Saturday's show of unity was aimed at supporting the hosts and decrying the US' refusal to engage in the G20's first African summit, one said.

The US' actions brought together countries at odds with Trump, such as India and South Africa, with others seeking to maintain good relations, including the UK and France, another said.

With the US taking up the mantle, there is a risk much of the work in Johannesburg could be undone. Washington is expected to narrow the G20's focus during its presidency, which coincides with the US' 250th anniversary, to just the leaders' summit and financial forum, jettisoning other working groups and ministers' meetings on energy, health and the environment. 

“The United States looks forward to emphasizing economic growth, deregulation and energy abundance as key pillars of its 2026 G20 host year,” a US Department of the Treasury spokesman said. “A back-to-basics approach at the G20 is long overdue.”

Entities including the IMF and the World Bank are still invited, but Washington plans to exclude UN organizations, a source familiar with the plans said.

Then again, it is only for a year. 

At worst, countries could “lay low” during the US presidency then resume work later, said one delegate who also declined to be named.

Despite the bitter differences, Washington's G20 agenda overlaps with Pretoria's in key areas such as development, economic growth and financial stability, UN adviser and Jubilee USA Network executive director Eric LeCompte said.

“I think there is going to be carry-over in certain areas with the US taking the mantle,” he said.



                                                                                There has been much catastrophizing in Taiwan recently about America becoming more unreliable as a bulwark against Chinese pressure. Some of this has been sparked by debates in Washington about whether the United States should defend Taiwan in event of conflict. There also were understandable anxieties about whether President Trump would sacrifice Taiwan's interests for a trade deal when he sat down with President Xi (習近平) in late October. On top of that, Taiwan's opposition political leaders have sought to score political points by attacking the Lai (賴清德) administration for mishandling relations with the United States.
Part of this budding anxiety                                    



                                                                                The diplomatic dispute between China and Japan over Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comments in the Japanese Diet continues to escalate.
In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, China's UN Ambassador Fu Cong (傅聰) wrote that, “if Japan dares to attempt an armed intervention in the cross-Strait situation, it would be an act of aggression.” 
There was no indication that Fu was aware of the irony implicit in the complaint. 
Until this point, Beijing had limited its remonstrations to diplomatic summonses and weaponization of economic levers, such as banning Japanese seafood imports, discouraging Chinese from traveling to Japan or issuing                                    



                                                                                Tokyo-Beijing relations have been rapidly deteriorating over the past two weeks as China tries to punish Japan over Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's remarks about Taiwan earlier this month, and the off-ramp to this conflict is yet to be seen.
Takaichi saying that a “Taiwan contingency” could cause a “situation threatening Japan's survival” — which would allow Japan to act in self-defense — has drawn Beijing's ire and sparked retaliatory measures. Her remark did not gain public attention until Chinese Consul General in Osaka Xue Jian (薛劍) made an apparent threat to behead her. 
The two sides lodged protests against each                                    



                                                                                The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Nov. 5 recalled more than 150,000 eggs found to contain three times the legal limit of the pesticide metabolite fipronil-sulfone. Nearly half of the 1,169 affected egg cartons, which had been distributed across 10 districts, had already been sold. Using the new traceability system, officials quickly urged the public to avoid consuming eggs with the traceability code “I47045,” while the remainder were successfully recalled.
Changhua County's Wenya Farm — the source of the tainted eggs — was fined NT$120,000, and the Ministry of Agriculture instructed the county's Animal Disease Control Center to require that

Raúl Rocha Cantú is under investigation for drug, gun and fuel trafficking while Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip is accused of fraud

This year's edition of Miss Universe, with its onstage injuries, dramatic walkouts and allegations of vote rigging, was already one for the ages.

But it turns out the drama had barely begun: just days after Fátima Bosch was crowned Miss Universe in Thailand, the co-owners of the organisation are both facing arrest warrants.

On Wednesday Mexican media revealed that Raúl Rocha Cantú, the Mexican businessman who owns half of the Miss Universe Organisation, was under investigation for drug, gun and fuel trafficking between Guatemala and Mexico.

Rocha, whose conglomerate spans industry, casinos and the beauty pageant, has denied wrongdoing. When asked about the case by El País, he said: “It is completely false that I have an arrest warrant.”

The attorney general's office later confirmed the existence of the investigation and said that arrest orders had been issued for 13 people, among them “Raúl R, about whom there have been various public reports”.

The other half of the Miss Universe Organisation is owned by the Thai media mogul Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip, for whom an arrest warrant was also this week issued by a Thai court.

Jakkaphong is accused of fraud by a plastic surgeon, who says she concealed information when persuading them to invest in her company, JKN Global Group.

A verdict for the case was due on Tuesday, but Jakkaphong failed to appear in court – prompting the judge to order her arrest, deeming her a flight risk. Her whereabouts are unclear.

They were the latest twists in a singularly dramatic edition of the Miss Universe competition.

At the start of November Bosch – then Miss Mexico – went viral when she staged a walkout after being berated as “dumb” by the pageant's director, who singled her out for failing to post promotional content.

After a public outcry, the director gave a tearful apology and claimed he had been misunderstood, and the Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, described Bosch as an “example of how we women should speak out”.

Bosch beat the crowd favourite, Miss Thailand, to win the crown – only for allegations of vote rigging to cast a shadow on her triumph.

Days before the final, two of the eight judges quit, with one suggesting that the vote was rigged. The other cited “unforeseen personal reasons”.

Mexican media have also reported on business ties between Rocha and Pemex, the Mexican state oil company where Bosch's father has worked for decades, prompting Rocha and Bosch's father to deny that there are any business ties between them personally.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Sheinbaum again came to Bosch's defence. “[Any investigation of Rocha] is independent of the young woman who won the competition. They want to connect them, but they are different. They want to detract from her achievement.”

The FBI's progress in obtaining intelligence on Antifa and tracing its financial networks has been boosted after the organization was labelled a domestic terror group, according to the agency's director, Kash Patel.

“We are following the money and mapping out this entire network,” Patel told The Epoch Times' senior editor Jan Jekielek.

            • 65 dead, many missing: The confirmed toll from Hong Kong's deadliest fire in decades rose to at least 65 people, with many more still missing. CNN is at the scene and we'll bring you the latest as we get it.
    


            • Survivor rescued:  Firefighters rescued a survivor from the 16th story of a high-rise building a day after the blaze broke out. Hong Kong's leader says fires are “basically under control” in the complex, home to a high percentage of elderly residents. Rescuers are still searching for the many missing residents.
    


            • Arrests made: The complex was under renovation and encased in bamboo scaffolding and safety netting. Three men who worked for a construction company have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter in relation to the fire.
    


            Black smoke is still billowing from the charred remains of several high-rise buildings in a Hong Kong apartment complex, more than 24 hours after the deadly blaze broke out.
    


            Many residents remain unaccounted for, and there are fears that the death toll could rise further. It is already Hong Kong's deadliest fire in seven decades.
    


Here are the latest developments:



• Dozens dead: At least 65 people have been killed in the blaze at Wang Fuk Court, which a building expert said surged 32 stories in just five minutes. The death toll has remained unchanged for several hours. Yesterday, authorities said 279 people were unaccounted for, and we don't know how many are still missing. It is not clear how many people were able to evacuate.
    


            • Survivor rescued: At around 6 p.m. local time, firefighters pulled a male survivor from the 16th story of Wang Tai House, one of the towers in the complex. No information has been provided about his health.
    


• Blaze “under control”: John Lee, the city's leader, said the fires across all seven buildings in the complex are “basically under control.” But live video footage shows pockets of fires still burning through apartment windows, indicating that the fight against the fire is not yet over.
    


• Financial aid: Lee said each household affected by the blaze will receive 10,000 Hong Kong dollars (about $1,200) in relief funds from the government. Hong Kong is also establishing an assistance fund for the housing estate, worth 300 million Hong Kong dollars ($38.5 million).
    


• Bamboo scaffolding: The deadly blaze has sparked a debate about Hong Kong's centuries-old use of bamboo scaffolding. Although bamboo is celebrated for its flexibility and low cost, construction experts are once again questioning the use of this flammable material in building projects. Lee said the government will inspect all bamboo scaffolding in the city, and official bodies will meet to discuss a move to metal scaffolding.
    


• Survivors share testimony: CNN reporters are on the ground and meeting those who have survived the disaster. One man recalled hearing people screaming for help on Wednesday afternoon, before seeing smoke billowing outside his window. Others have questioned the reliability of the complex's fire alarms.
    


• Evacuation centers: About 500 people are taking shelter in nine emergency centers, Lee said. The affected residents will be attended to by 250 doctors and 250 other medical professionals.
    


            Hong Kong's Hospital Authority (HA) said around 50 of its staff members have been left homeless by the blaze at the Wang Fuk Court complex.
    


            One staff member remains missing, while another was injured in the blaze, the authority said.
    


                    “The HA will provide full assistance and appropriate support to affected staff members, including temporary accommodation arrangements and compassionate leave for those in need,” it said Thursday evening.
                





            A survivor has been rescued from one of the towers in the Wang Fuk Court complex, Hong Kong's fire department said Thursday evening, as the death toll from the blaze climbed to at least 65 people.
    


            Firefighters found a male survivor on the 16th story of Wang Tai House, one of the towers in the complex, the fire department said in an update at 8 p.m. local time (7 a.m. ET), according to public broadcaster RTHK.
    


            A further 70 people have been injured, the department said. One firefighter is among the dead, and 10 other firefighters have been injured.
    


            Hong Kong leader John Lee said the city is arranging a “one social worker per household” policy to ensure that Wang Fuk Court residents get the help they need.
    


            The government will also provide psychologists to provide emotional support to residents, Lee said.
    


            Survivors of the blaze who have taken shelter in schools and sports centers have told CNN how they escaped as flames engulfed their homes yesterday, many with only the clothes they were wearing.
    


            One resident in his 40s told CNN he was watching television in his eighth-floor apartment when he heard people screaming for help. “The instant I opened the window, I saw the smoke,” said Wan, who CNN is identifying only by his surname.
    


            “There's no home to go back to,” said Wan, who spent the night at an emergency shelter with his wife, as volunteers and staff walked around distributing food and drinks. “We have nothing, not even clothes.”
    


            Another resident surnamed Yuen said he was most concerned about his parents – who are in their 70s and live in a separate apartment on the same floor as him and his wife. On Wednesday afternoon, Yuen rushed home from work when he heard the news, but wasn't allowed to enter the building, he said. He hasn't heard from his parents since.

            After a huge fire broke out in Hong Kong's Wang Fuk Court, debates about the safety of bamboo scaffolding resurfaced. CNN's Karina Tsui has more from the scene of the fire.

            Hong Kong leader John Lee said each household affected by the deadly ongoing blaze in the city will receive relief funds from the government.
    


            “To help affected residents, we will hand out 10,000 Hong Kong dollars (about $1,200) to each household,” Lee said Thursday night.
    


            The Hong Kong government will establish an assistance fund for the Wang Fuk Court housing estate, allocating 300 million Hong Kong dollars (about $38.5 million) in aid to affected residents, said city leader John Lee in an ongoing news conference.
    


            Speaking Thursday evening, he laid out several additional measures as the city mourns those killed and affected by the fire, including a memorial event.
    


            The government will cancel all celebratory events on the schedule, while government officials will avoid participating in “unnecessary” public events, Lee said.
    


            He called for the public and other organizations to send in donations for those impacted.
    


            Lee also thanks Chinese leader Xi Jinping for his “concern” over the fire.
    


            Hong Kong leader John Lee told reporters that the government is going to inspect all bamboo scaffolding in the city in the wake of the deadly ongoing blaze.
    


            “The development bureau is already meeting with the construction bureau to discuss that metal scaffolding will be used instead of bamboo scaffolding,” Lee said Thursday night.

            As firefighters work to extinguish the last of the flames in Hong Kong, about 500 people are using nine emergency shelters, according to the city's leader John Lee.
    


            He added that 250 doctors and 250 other medical professionals will be set up in medical centers at these temporary shelters, and that the government is working to support bereaved family members.
    


            “We are experiencing a collective pain,” he said, speaking at a news conference Thursday evening. “At this difficult moment, we need to face it with strength and get through this hard time together.”
    


            The fires across all seven buildings in Hong Kong's Wang Fuk Court are “basically under control,” the city's leader John Lee said at an ongoing news conference.
    


            Live video footage of the housing complex, which has been burning since Wednesday afternoon local time, still shows isolated pockets of fires burning through apartment windows.
    


            Hong Kong leader John Lee said the ongoing massive blaze in the city has killed 55 people — the same figure previously provided by fire officials.
    


            Firefighters will keep battling the blaze and searching for missing residents, he said.
    


            Hong Kong's leader John Lee is addressing reporters in his first televised remarks on the city's deadly blaze.
    


            Hong Kong's banking industry has been urged to help those affected by the fire at Wang Fuk Court to access funds, with HSBC announcing a raft of emergency measures to support the victims of the blaze and their families.
    


            The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) asked banks to help those affected to access their funds, replace lost banking documents, offer repayment grace periods and waive penalties and service charges.
    


            They also called on banks to increase staffing at their branches in the Tai Po region.
    


                    “The HKMA and the HKAB will continue to closely monitor the development of the situation and co-ordinate with the industry to address the affected families' needs for urgent banking services and liquidity,” the central bank said in a statement Thursday.
                





            HSBC – Hong Kong's largest bank – said it is “deeply saddened” by the fire and has implemented emergency measures including hotlines and increased staffing to support residents of Wang Fuk Court.
    


            As smoke is still rising from the remains of the Wang Fuk Court and emergency workers try to find survivors, volunteers have been scrambling to rescue residents' pets.
    


            Animal welfare agencies arrived with oxygenated pet carriers and animal ambulances to bring the pets to safety. Videos on social media have shown cats, dogs and even a tortoise being rescued.
    


                    “So far we have rescued around a dozen cats and seven to eight dogs. Some tortoises to,” Anson Cheng, a volunteer with Hong Kong Guardians, an animal welfare group, told Reuters Thursday.
                





            “From yesterday, we have around 20 volunteers here rescuing animals and people. There are also vets and veterinary nurses here helping too,” he added.
    


            Some animal welfare workers had to ask police to allow them through cordons keeping out the public, Reuters reported, as the fire still blazed in the complex.
    


            Flames surged 32 stories in just five minutes at Hong Kong's Wang Fuk Court, leaving residents facing a fierce struggle against a 20-minute evacuation time, a building expert said.
    


            “The time for people to evacuate from a 32-story building is essentially very slow,” said Xinyan Huang, associate professor at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University's Department of Building Environment and Energy Engineering.
    


                    “It takes at least ten, 20 minutes. But the fire spread to the top in five minutes or less.”
                





            When asked about the investigation into the fire, Huang suggested that the critical question concerns not the cause of the fire but its rapid spread.
    


                    “Overall, I think the cause of the fire is not so critical because the building is designed to handle random fire incidents, but it is not designed to handle such a fast fire spread outside the building and eventually spread back into the building,” he told CNN's Rosemary Church. “This is not something that's considered in the building fire code.”
                





            Huang said bamboo is “definitely a flammable material” that is likely to ignite in Hong Kong's current dry season, with vertically oriented poles allowing fire to spread upward with ease.
    


                    “And this is very similar to the other facade fire with flammable cladding. Once ignited, there is no time for firefighters to stop the fire spread.”
                





            He drew parallels to London's Grenfell fire, Britain's deadliest since WWII, which claimed 72 lives due to it being a 24-story residential building covered in flammable cladding.
    


            Mrs Dang said Wang Fuk Court was an ideal place to raise her growing family of four, after her husband won the public housing ballot that allowed them to buy a unit in the complex.
    


            That was more than 20 years ago, and her kids have since married and moved away. But she remained living at the apartment, in Block 4.
    


            Dang, 68, who gave only her surname, said she returned from a dance class Wednesday afternoon to see Block 6 consumed in flames.
    


            “After a few hours, the other buildings started catching fire,” she told CNN from outside the CCC Fung Leung Kit Memorial Secondary School in Tai Po. “My clothes are all black from the fire spit.”
    


                    “All I've done is watch my home burn to ashes,” she added.
                





            Dang said that, due to the recent renovation work, many windows outside the apartments were lined with plastic or polystyrene and scaffolding.
    


            “I couldn't even tell you if it was sunny or raining until I left my building,” she said.
    


            “It's difficult to imagine going back to living at the estate even if repairs are done. It all seems corrupt.”
    


Wang Fuk Court was home to a larger population of elderly residents than in many Hong Kong housing estates.
    


            As of 2021 — when the city's most recent census took place — 4,643 people called the estate their home.
    


            Roughly 36% of residents were 65 or older, according to Centaline Property Agency, which uses the city's government data.
    


            That's much higher than the percentage of elderly people in Hong Kong overall — 19.6%, according to Centaline.
    


            The median age of the tenants at Wang Fuk Court was 56, the data shows.
    


            Officials are investigating “potential corruption” linked to renovations at Wang Fuk Court, the Hong Kong complex afflicted by a massive blaze.
    


            The Independent Commission Against Corruption, Hong Kong's statutory anti-graft body, announced on Thursday that it had set up a dedicated task force “given the significant public interest in this matter.”
    


                    The ICAC pledged to “conduct a thorough investigation into potential corruption related to the major renovation project at Wang Fuk Court.”
                





Parallel inquiries: The fire spread in an “unusual” manner, other officials said, and a criminal investigation has been launched, Security Secretary Chris Tang said. Hong Kong Police said they arrested three men – two directors and a consultant of a construction company – on suspicion of manslaughter, and accused them of “gross negligence.” Authorities will also investigate whether building materials complied with fire safety standards.

BISHKEK, November 27. /TASS/. Moscow generally agrees that the US' list of points on Ukraine could form a basis for future agreements, Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters.

"In general, we agree that this could be the basis for future agreements," he said.

"It would be impolite of me to talk about any final options now as there aren't any. But some things are fundamental," Putin added.

The American side takes Russia's position, which was discussed before and after Anchorage, into account in some ways, he noted. "Somewhere we definitely need to sit down and seriously discuss some specific things," Putin said.

"We need to put everything into diplomatic language because it's one thing to state in general terms that Russia does not plan to attack Europe. Frankly, that sounds ridiculous. We never had any intention of doing that. But if they want to hear it from us, well, okay, we'll state it for the record, no problem," he said.

Editor's note: The story was updated with additional details.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Nov. 27 reiterated his demand that Ukrainian forces withdraw from their current positions as a condition for a ceasefire, even as the U.S. attempts to reinvigorate peace talks.

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, who faces scrutiny after a leak reportedly caught him coaching a Russian official on how to sway the White House, is expected to travel to Moscow to discuss the latest peace efforts with Putin. 

The Russian leader confirmed a visit by the U.S. delegation early next week.

"Ukrainian troops will withdraw from the territories they occupy, and then the fighting will cease," the Russian president told reporters. "If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this through military force."

Moscow has repeatedly rejected calls by Kyiv and its Western partners for a ceasefire, instead demanding that Ukraine cede the entire Donbas region.

Russia illegally declared all of the partially occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts as its territory during sham referenda in September 2022.

Putin stressed that the recognition of Russian rule over Crimea and Donbas — a demand Kyiv has ruled out — remains a key point in talks with the U.S.

The comments come after the Trump administration unveiled a 28-point peace plan for Ukraine last week, which imposed punishing conditions on Kyiv, including a limit on the military size, a ban on NATO membership, and a Ukrainian withdrawal from Donbas.

The plan came as the latest move in Trump's uneven strategy for brokering an end to the all-out war, which is nearing its fourth anniversary.

Speaking at the press briefing, Putin repeated that the U.S. peace plan — an original version of which is speculated to be based on a Russian document — could serve as the basis for future agreements, adding that the text needs further discussion.

The initial plan was met with pushback from Ukraine and Europe, and a revised version of the draft was compiled after consultations between U.S., European, and Ukrainian officials in Geneva on Nov. 23.

Putin claimed that after the Geneva negotiations, the plan was divided into four parts, but did not elaborate further. He also revealed that the Russian Foreign Ministry and Kremlin aides Yuri Ushakov and Vladimir Medinsky would oversee the negotiations.

Commenting on the leaked call between Witkoff and Ushakov, Putin said such disclosures could amount to a criminal offense, while not ruling out that the intercepts might be fabricated.

The Kremlin's chief alleged that those targeting Witkoff are the same actors who, alongside Ukraine's leadership, "want to fight until the last Ukrainian." He added, "As I've already said publicly, we're ready for that."

The Russian leader further declared that signing any documents with Ukraine is pointless, implying the Ukrainian leadership is not legitimate due to the postponement of elections.

Ukraine's constitution prohibits holding elections under martial law, which was declared at the outbreak of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022.

Putin also ridiculed parts of the proposed peace plan and rejected claims that Russia is preparing to attack European countries — though he said he would be willing to formally put that assurance in writing.

Tensions between European NATO members and Moscow have been surging in recent months, with allies accusing Russia of escalating hybrid operations and warning of an open conflict within the next five years.

Diplomatic row worsens after US president says member state will not be invited to 2026 summit

Donald Trump has said that South Africa will not be invited to G20 events in the United States when it presides over the forum next year, a measure the African nation described as “punitive”.

The US president repeated widely discredited claims that South Africa is “killing white people”, extending a diplomatic row between the countries after the US boycotted the summit in Johannesburg last weekend.

Trump posted on his Truth Social platform: “At the conclusion of the G20, South Africa refused to hand off the G20 Presidency to a Senior Representative from our U.S. Embassy, who attended the Closing Ceremony. Therefore, at my direction, South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20, which will be hosted in the Great City of Miami, Florida next year.

“South Africa has demonstrated to the World they are not a country worthy of Membership anywhere, and we are going to stop all payments and subsidies to them, effective immediately.”

Trump had already said in February he was stopping aid to South Africa, accusing the government of discriminating against white minority Afrikaners, who ruled the country during apartheid and remain on average many times wealthier than black South Africans, including inciting violence against white farmers and confiscating their land.

South Africa's government and many of its citizens have repeatedly pushed back against these claims, noting that land expropriation is only allowed under limited circumstances and that South Africa's high crime rate affects everyone in the country.

A statement released by South Africa's presidency said Trump's comments were “regrettable”. It continued: “South Africa is a member of the G20 in its own name and right. Its G20 membership is at the behest of all other members. South Africa is a sovereign constitutional democratic country and does not appreciate insults from another country about its membership and worth in participating in global platforms.

“South Africa … will never insult or demean another country … It is regrettable that despite the efforts and numerous attempts by President Ramaphosa and his administration to reset the diplomatic relationship with the US, President Trump continues to apply punitive measures against South Africa based on misinformation and distortions about our country.”

After the US confirmed it was boycotting the G20 leaders summit, the first in Africa, having also not attended other G20 events in South Africa, it demanded the presidency be handed over to their acting ambassador at the event's closing ceremony.

However, South Africa rejected this, saying it would be a breach of protocol for Ramaphosa to symbolically give the presidency to a “junior” diplomat. It hailed the summit as a success for multilateralism, with a leaders' communique that emphasised the importance of tackling issues including climate change and gender inequalities, all of which are anathema to Trump's administration.

Meanwhile, Trump and US officials have continued to repeat the false claims about South Africa's treatment of Afrikaners. In May, it began offering white South Africans refugee status in the US, while stopping all other refugee arrivals.

Trump said in his Truth Social post on Tuesday: “The United States did not attend the G20 in South Africa, because the South African Government refuses to acknowledge or address the horrific Human Right Abuses endured by Afrikaners, and other descendants of Dutch, French, and German settlers.

“To put it more bluntly, they are killing white people, and randomly allowing their farms to be taken from them.”

In the last quarter of 2024, South African police recorded 12 murders on farms, including black-owned smallholder plots, out of almost 7,000 murders across the country.

Private land ownership remains concentrated with the country's white minority. Land has been returned by courts to black owners displaced during the colonial and apartheid eras in just a handful of cases, after lengthy legal processes.

President called the shooting in Washington an ‘act of terror'. Plus, Hong Kong fire death toll rises to 65

Good morning.

Donald Trump has said the government should review every Afghan immigrant who entered the US during Joe Biden's administration, after authorities identified the suspect in the shooting of two national guard members in Washington as an Afghan national.

A statement from the Department of Homeland Security named the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old who came to the US after the withdrawal of its armed forces from Afghanistan in 2021. Immigration authorities granted Lakanwal asylum earlier this year, according to CNN. The shooting, which happened near the Farragut West metro station, close to the White House, took place amid the Trump administration's controversial deployment of troops to Washington DC.

What is the latest on the condition of the national guard members? They remained in critical condition overnight.

Police have alleged that the use of unsafe construction materials during maintenance work may be to blame for the rapid spread of a fire at a group of residential tower blocks that has killed at least 65 people in Hong Kong's deadliest blaze in decades.

Firefighters were still trying to reach people who could be trapped on the upper floors of the Wang Fuk Court housing complex on Thursday because of the fire's intense heat and thick smoke. More than 250 remained missing and a further 45 people have been taken to hospital in critical condition.

Have there been arrests? Yes – police have arrested two directors and an engineering consultant at a construction company.

The west is missing several “obscure” – but potentially key – sanctions that could impede Russia's war effort in Ukraine, research by a US civil society group has found.

While previous sanctions have focused on Russian energy companies, banks, military suppliers and oil tankers, Dekleptocracy's research has identified chemicals used to make mechanical lubricants and military-grade tires as an important vulnerability that US, UK and EU policymakers have so far failed to exploit.

Why might it be significant? A small number of companies manufacture the chemicals for mechanical lubricants – and almost all stopped selling to Russia after it invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Targeting its remaining main supplier would create a lubricant shortage that “would seriously damage Russia's war machine”.

Can't Russia produce these chemicals domestically? It currently lacks domestic producers of many key chemicals. Moscow launched an initiative this year to produce hundreds of chemicals itself – further evidence that the sector is a weakness, Dekeleptocracy says.

Georgia's state prosecutor has confirmed the last criminal case against Trump is “over”, after a superior court judge issued an order on Wednesday dismissing the 2020 racketeering case.

Karoline Leavitt's nephew's mother, who migrated from Brazil as a child, has been detained by US immigration agents in Massachusetts and is being held in custody in Louisiana.

A monthly injection could be used to control severe asthma, a clinical trial has found.

Trump reportedly asked the Japanese prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, to avoid further escalation in a dispute with China during a call this week.

The number of women in prisons around the world is approaching 1 million, with this figure rising at nearly three times the rate of men in recent decades. While women are a small minority in prison populations around the world, since 2000 the number imprisoned has grown by 57%, compared with a 22% increase in the men's prison population. Women are disproportionately jailed for petty crimes linked to poverty, and prisoners face sexual violence and forced labour in prisons, while pregnant women receive inadequate maternal care.

When X recently rolled out a new feature revealing the locations of popular accounts, it became clear that dozens of big “America first” and pro-Trump accounts were based overseas. Many are based in Asia – but experts are split over whether these accounts, many of which claim to be run by Americans, are part of state-backed influence campaigns, or just opportunists looking to make some fast cash.

Australia will need to drastically step up its climate policies to meet its recently announced 2035 emissions reduction target, according to an official projection. Under existing policies, the country will reduce emissions by 2035 by just 48% compared with 2005 levels – well below its target of a cut of between 62% and 70% by that year.

Planning – and hosting – a great party can seem daunting. While a few points in this guide might come too late if you're hosting today, the number one thing to remember is that, for you and your guests to have a good time, you need to not be stressed. (It really, really helps to avoid serving your guests a dish you've never attempted before.) As for being a good guest, Zoe Williams's guide has that covered, too: don't cancel at the last minute and don't be cliquey – talk to people you don't know.

Ukraine and the U.K. have signed a license agreement to produce Octopus interceptor drones, Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Nov. 27.

"This is a historical precedent and the next important step that will allow the production of Ukrainian interceptors in the United Kingdom, which have proven their effectiveness in the fight against (Russian attack drones)," Shmyhal said in a post on Telegram.

Russian Shahed-type drones, originally designed in Iran and mass-produced in Russia under the name Geran-2, have become a central weapon in Moscow's strikes against Ukraine.

Kyiv has rapidly developed its drone capabilities since 2022, evolving from modifying commercial aircraft to producing attack drones and reconnaissance systems on a large scale.

The Octopus drone is one of several interceptor drones in development.

"Mass production of interceptors is planned, which may reach several thousand per month," Shmyhal said, adding: "The manufactured means will be transferred to Ukraine to strengthen the protection of our skies."

Shmyhal said on Sept. 18 that Kyiv will be able to deploy at least 1,000 interceptor drones daily to repel Russian attacks "in the near future," without specifying the time range.

A senior US official warned European diplomats in Kiev last week that Russia's ability to produce long-range weaponry is increasing, and that failing to rapidly resolve the Ukraine conflict would only raise the chances of escalation, the New York Times reported on Wednesday.

According to the newspaper, US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said Russia's production capacity allows Moscow to not only continue striking Ukrainian targets with long-range weapons but also build up a surplus.

Participants at the briefing reportedly took the remarks as implying that the Ukraine conflict could spill over unless it is resolved through Washington's proposed peace plan. Moscow has repeatedly warned against any escalation of the conflict.

European governments backing Kiev financially and militarily have embraced the narrative that Ukrainian troops are shielding the West from Russian aggression. Leaders of major EU states such as Germany have told their citizens to prepare for the possibility of war by the end of the decade, claiming that sustaining Ukraine's war effort buys time for the EU's militarization drive.

Moscow maintains that the hostilities are a NATO proxy war sparked by the bloc's continued eastward expansion. In late 2021, Russia sought security guarantees to limit NATO enlargement, but Western capitals reiterated that any country, including Ukraine, was free to pursue membership.

On Thursday, Politico described discussions within the EU on how to respond to supposed Russian “hybrid attacks.” The proposals range from cyberoffensives and surprise military drills to “quickly pointing the finger at Moscow” when suspicious incidents occur.

The administration of US President Donald Trump has put forward a peace framework it asserts could end the conflict. Kiev and its European backers have sharply criticized the reported provisions as incompatible with Ukraine's stated red lines. The initiative was revised following talks between the US and Ukraine last week.

Russia has publicly distanced itself from the American proposal. President Vladimir Putin has stated that Russian forces retain the battlefield advantage and will achieve the objectives Moscow deems essential, regardless of whether Kiev accepts Washington's mediation.

The US has suspended the processing of all immigration requests from Afghan nationals after an Afghan asylum seeker was identified as the suspect in the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC.

The decision came after Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said the suspect was “an Afghan national who was one of the many unvetted, mass-paroled into the United States under Operation Allies Welcome on September 8, 2021, under the Biden administration.”

Multiple media outlets reported earlier that the suspect, who allegedly critically injured two guardsmen in an ambush-style attack on Wednesday, is Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who entered the US in 2021 and was granted asylum earlier this year.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced on Wednesday evening that it has “stopped processing all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals indefinitely, pending further review of security and vetting protocols.”

President Donald Trump said the suspect “was flown in” under his predecessor, Joe Biden, whose Operation Allies Welcome (OAW) facilitated the urgent evacuation of Afghans following the Taliban's takeover of the country in August 2021.

“We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country,” Trump said.

According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), around 90,000 Afghans entered the US under OAW and were allowed to remain in the country. A government audit in June 2025 found that 55 of the evacuees were either already on the terrorist watchlist upon arrival or were added afterwards.

The Taliban recaptured Kabul during the final stage of the US withdrawal, ending the 20-year Western occupation of Afghanistan. Trump described the chaotic exit as a “humiliation” and accused Biden of damaging America's reputation.

The Toronto-area lawyer for alleged drug kingpin Ryan Wedding and a Vancouver man accused of laundering money for the former Olympic snowboarder appeared in court Wednesday as part of proceedings to extradite them to the U.S. 

Two other men who are among the eight Canadians charged last week in relation to the alleged international drug-trafficking ring also had scheduled court appearances on Wednesday. 

Efforts to extradite the accused are expected to be complicated by questions about whether U.S. prosecutors will seek the death penalty. And as a recent ruling in a related case illustrates, the proceedings could be lengthy and hard-fought.

Long before Ryan Wedding was one of the FBI's most wanted, he was swept up in a U.S. drug case

Lawyer Deepak Paradkar, who faces multiple charges, including allegedly advising Mr. Wedding to kill a key witness who was set to testify against him, made a brief virtual court appearance in Ontario Superior Court in Toronto. Wearing an orange jail-issue shirt and with a grey beard, Mr. Paradkar was told his bail hearing is scheduled for Dec. 10. 

Meanwhile in British Columbia, Rasheed Pascua Hossain, who faces accusations of laundering hundreds of millions of dollars of the group's ill-gotten gains, appeared in court via video link with close-cropped hair and clad in a red jail jumpsuit. Mr. Hossain was ordered not to contact any of his co-accused and is to appear in court for his bail hearing next Thursday. 

The cases of two other co-accused, Rolan Sokolovski and Gursewak Singh Bal, were also before the Toronto court on Wednesday. They are scheduled to appear in court next month. 

Who are the Canadians facing charges connected to Ryan Wedding?

They are among eight men arrested last week who face charges in relation to their alleged roles in a murder-for-hire conspiracy that Mr. Wedding is accused of leading that resulted in the slaying of Jonathan Acevedo-Garcia, an associate who became a police informant. None of the allegations have been tested in court. Mr. Wedding is believed to be hiding in Mexico despite a multimillion-dollar reward and a manhunt lasting more than a year. 

The extradition of these Canadians “would happen tomorrow if it were up to me,” RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme said last week. 

However, a recent court decision in the case of two Toronto-area men who also face extradition to the U.S. in connection to Mr. Wedding's alleged drug ring illustrates the often-prolonged nature of such proceedings.

Ontario Superior Court Justice Ed Morgan on Friday ordered the RCMP to release notes and recordings related to an undercover operation that contributed to the arrest of Hardeep Ratte and Gurpreet Singh last year on charges of conspiracy to transport cocaine for Mr. Wedding. 

The ruling is a victory for the men, who are fighting prosecutors' efforts to put them on trial in Los Angeles. 

Justice Morgan's decision could also set the tone for extradition proceedings for the eight Canadians swept up last week. 

Extradition cases can drag on for years in Canadian courts and fights over disclosure of evidence further “stretch the proceedings out,” said Robert Currie, a law professor at Dalhousie University.

Under the extradition process, a judge must find that the alleged conduct is also a serious crime in Canada and that there is at least some evidence against the accused in the requesting country. 

The federal Justice Minister makes the final decision after considering several factors and can refuse to surrender an individual if they could face the death penalty abroad. 

A spokesperson for Justice Canada declined comment on specific cases, but said Canadian law broadly blocks extraditions of suspects if they might face the death penalty abroad. 

“Canada's extradition regime includes robust protections and safeguards,” said Ian McLeod. 

U.S. justice officials have not commented on questions about the possibility of prosecutors seeking the death penalty in the cases of the eight Canadians arrested last week. 

Who is Ryan Wedding, the former Canadian Olympic snowboarder on the FBI's Most Wanted list?

U.S. Attorney-General Pam Bondi said in February that Andrew Clark, a Canadian alleged to be Mr. Wedding's second-in-command who faces charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder and drug trafficking, could face “death or life imprisonment” if convicted. Mr. Clark is in jail in Los Angeles awaiting trial after his arrest in Mexico last year. 

However, in April, a U.S. prosecutor filed a notice in court saying that Mr. Clark would not face the death penalty. The reasons for the waiver are unclear. 

The U.S. case against many of the alleged Wedding operatives appears to rely heavily on evidence from a “co-operating witness” – a mole who helped police and conducted undercover operations targeting associates. 

The co-operating witness is believed to be Mr. Acebedo-Garcia, who was killed in Colombia on Jan. 31 after Mr. Wedding allegedly went on the hunt for an informant in his midst. Several of the eight Canadians recently arrested are charged with conspiracy to commit murder in relation to his death. 

The two men arrested last year, Mr. Ratte and his nephew, Mr. Singh, face charges of conspiracy to transport cocaine for a drug-trafficking organization. Police allege they ran the Wedding ring's Canada-based drug transportation network for the first half of 2024, helping to ship hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Southern California to Canada in long-haul semi-trucks.

According to Justice Morgan's decision last week, the co-operating witness met with Mr. Ratte and Mr. Singh at an auto-body shop in Brampton, Ont., on Feb. 22, 2024, in an undercover operation managed by the RCMP. 

Justice Morgan ordered Canadian prosecutors to provide defence lawyers with copies of RCMP officers' notes and memos as well as audio and video recordings made by the co-operating witness in Canada. 

“Not only do the Charter and Canadian rules of evidence gathering apply to Canadian state actors in the investigation, but the obligations of fundamental justice must apply to the [extradition] committal hearing,” the ruling says. 

Justice Morgan also ordered Canadian prosecutors to reveal the co-operating witness's identity to defence lawyers unless there are concerns for the safety of any family members. If that is the case, the judge said prosecutors must disclose whether the informant can ever be produced as a witness. 

Seven Canadians have been arrested for extradition to the United States in relation to a drug trafficking probe involving Ryan Wedding, a former Team Canada Olympian turned fugitive. Wedding is believed to be hiding in Mexico and the U.S. State Department has increased the reward for information leading to his arrest to US$15-million.

The Canadian Press

Justice Morgan noted that a revised record from last February outlining the U.S. investigation relies on evidence gathered by the co-operating witness but says the informant will not testify at trial, without explaining why. 

“His disappearance from the record in which he was previously the central figure and almost the sole source of the evidence raises an air of reality about the reliability of much of the evidence now described in the” document, he wrote. 

Justice Morgan also ordered prosecutors to give Mr. Singh's lawyers Canadian police records related to his kidnapping in Mexico in August, 2024, and “all information” related to the incident exchanged between Canadian and foreign authorities. 

Mr. Singh was captured by cartel members in relation to an apparent unpaid drug debt and was held until $400,000 was paid on his behalf and after the alleged intervention of Mr. Wedding, the ruling says. 

Mr. Singh's lawyers have alleged potential police abuse of process in relation to the kidnapping, saying investigators knew he was in danger but did not warn him. 

Justice Morgan did not make a finding about police conduct, saying more evidence is required. He noted that the FBI appeared to have been monitoring real-time communications in which the kidnapping was discussed. In addition, he said that U.S. and possibly Canadian authorities knew of Mr. Singh's plans to travel to Mexico and the reasons for his meeting. 

“Some further disclosure is called for. The prospect that an abuse of process has occurred is realistic enough to support the need for further investigation,” he wrote.

Two national guardsmen are in critical condition and a wounded suspect is in custody after what officials said was a targeted shooting near the White House, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to order 500 more troops to Washington and promise to expand his crackdown on immigration.

A man walked around a corner, raised a gun and opened fire around 2:15 p.m. Wednesday, according to local police, shooting two members of the West Virginia National Guard outside an entrance to the Farragut West metro station. The suspect was also shot, though it was not immediately clear by whom.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the suspect is an Afghan national who came to the U.S. as part of Operation Allies Welcome on Sept. 8, 2021. The program allowed Afghans who had worked with American forces in Afghanistan to come to the U.S. following the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country and the Taliban takeover. 

U.S. media, citing unnamed law-enforcement sources, identified the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, and said he had been living in Bellingham, Wash. The Reuters news agency reported that the attack was being investigated as a potential act of terrorism.

In a video address from Palm Beach, Fla., where he is spending the Thanksgiving holiday, Mr. Trump said he would clamp down on Afghan refugees.

“This attack underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation,” the President said, accusing former president Joe Biden of letting in “unknown and unvetted foreigners” from “places that you don't want to even know about.”

Mr. Trump said the U.S. government would now “re-examine every single alien” who entered the U.S. from Afghanistan under Mr. Biden's administration. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that it had suspended all immigration applications from Afghan nationals.

The wounded guardsmen were part of a wave of troop and federal police deployments by Mr. Trump across several U.S. cities, aimed at clamping down on crime, clearing homeless encampments and supporting efforts to round up undocumented immigrants for deportation.

The attack unfolded about two blocks from the White House. Mr. Trump and other top officials were away at the time.

CNN, citing police sources, reported that the suspect received U.S. asylum this year, during Mr. Trump's presidency. A relative of Mr. Lakanwal's told NBC that he served in the Afghan army for 10 years, including in Kandahar, and helped U.S. special forces. NBC, citing law enforcement sources, said the weapon used in the shooting was a handgun.

West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey initially said the two guardsmen had died before correcting himself, saying that he was hearing conflicting reports. Police later said both guardsmen are still alive but in critical condition.

“This is a targeted shooting. One individual who appeared to target these guardsmen,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said at the scene.

Jeffrey Carroll, executive assistant chief of the city's Metropolitan Police Department, said the motive for the shooting was still under investigation and that there is currently only one suspect. He said the guards who were shot were armed at the time. 

Other guards held the suspect down after the shooting until he could be arrested by police, Mr. Carroll said. He said it was not yet known what type of gun the suspect used.

“This is a matter of national security. This is a matter of pride,” FBI director Kash Patel said.

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said he had started the process of sending 500 more national guards to Washington on Mr. Trump's orders. “This will only stiffen our resolve. We will never back down. We will secure our capital, we will secure our cities,” he told reporters outside the Pentagon.

There are currently 2,000 national guards deployed to the city. Mr. Trump sent the troops in August, along with officers from several federal agencies. He also temporarily took control of the Metropolitan Police.

The crackdown has targeted undocumented immigrants, homeless encampments and street crime. It has entailed setting up checkpoints on busy streets and conducting spot patrols in bar districts. While police have taken the lead on most of these operations, guardsmen have at times been deployed to help them and also serve as sentinels at monuments and metro stations, and to clean up trash on the National Mall.

Mr. Trump has previously taken action against Afghan refugees by ending a temporary protected status program this past summer as part of a broader push to strip some groups of immigrants of the legal ability to stay in the U.S.

In his address on Wednesday, the President also directed unrelated criticism at Somali refugees in Minnesota, accusing them of “ripping off our country” and “ripping apart” the state.

Mr. Trump's deployment of troops to Washington – as well as other major cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland and Memphis – has drawn protests and lawsuits. Critics charge that it violates local autonomy and unnecessarily militarizes cities and law enforcement. They also accuse Mr. Trump of setting the stage for crackdowns on protests by normalizing the presence of troops in the streets.

A federal judge last week ruled that sending the National Guard into Washington was illegal because Mr. Trump does not have the power to take such a step unilaterally. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb suspended her ruling from taking effect until Dec. 11 to give the government time to appeal.

West Virginia deployed 300 National Guardsmen to Washington in August. Of those, 160 extended their deployment until the end of the year.

Two members of the National Guard were shot in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday near the White House, putting the building into lockdown with President Donald Trump away in Florida.

While Washington saw a spike in homicides after the height of COVID-19 lockdowns, violent crime plummeted to a 30-year low in 2024. And a daylight shooting at Farragut – a busy part of the city's central business district, heavily trafficked by tourists and office workers, and dominated by a large public square – came as a shock.

Bystander Mike Jones described the immediate aftermath of the shooting as “bedlam.” He said people coming out of the metro witnessed the gunfire and crowds rushed away from the scene. Nearby businesses were locked down.

“I haven't seen this kind of thing. It's unnerving,” said Mr. Jones, who works in the area. “It's a product of our current time, and we have to find a way to get past this, find a way for everyone to work together.”

He said it was particularly tragic happening on the eve of one of the U.S.'s most important holidays. “Two families are going to have to deal with this tomorrow. This shouldn't be the conversation happening around the table.”

Even before Mr. Trump's National Guard deployment, the area around the White House was heavily secured by several police agencies. The building itself is surrounded by a 3.6-metre wrought iron fence and the Secret Service, which protects the President and other officials, often closes off the adjacent street.

In addition to the Secret Service and Metropolitan Police, U.S. Park Police are deployed at the nearby National Mall.

BUENOS AIRES, November 27. /TASS/. Argentina has officially proposed chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi as candidate for United Nations Secretary General.

"The Republic of Argentina has the honor to propose Rafael Grossi, the IAEA Director General, as candidate for UN Secretary General in 2027-2031," the country's foreign ministry said.

The IAEA chief has demonstrated "the ability of promoting political dialogue amid conflicts and serious international crises," which makes his a right candidate for UN secretary general, it said.

On Wednesday, the UN Security Council and the General Assembly published a joint letter to initiate the procedure of electing the global organization's new secretary general.

Candidates to the post are nominated by member states, and each country can nominate only one contender. For the nomination, countries are to send relevant letters to the chairs of the Security Council and the General Assembly. In turn, candidates are to present their vision of the organization's development, and declare their sources of income. If a candidate is working at a UN body, he is to suspend his duties for the period of election to avoid conflict of interest.

The election itself is expected to take place in late July 2026.

The term of the current head of the global organization, Antonio Guterres, ends on December 31, 2026. Rafael Grossi and Rebeca Grynspan, Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), have declared their intention to run for UN secretary general.

The UN secretary-general is elected by the UN Security Council and approved by the General Assembly for a five-year term with a possibility of re-election. The number of terms is not limited, but the longest-serving secretaries served for ten years. In accordance with the existing practice, a secretary-general should not come from the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - Russia, the United Kingdom, China, the United States and France.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The brazen daytime shooting of two National Guard members in the nation's capital by a man authorities identified as an Afghan national has raised multiple questions. 

Officials have released the name of the suspect, who is in custody, and the names of the two Guard members who were shot, but the suspect's motive for the attack is not yet clear. 

Here's what we know so far, and what we don't know:

The Guard members, who have been identified as Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, were hospitalized in critical condition after Wednesday's shooting. 

They belong to the West Virginia National Guard, which deployed hundreds of troops to the nation's capital as part of President Donald Trump's crime-fighting mission that involved taking over the local police department. 

There were nearly 2,200 Guard members in D.C. for the mission.

West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey initially posted on social media that two of his state's Guard members were killed. He later walked that back, saying his office was “receiving conflicting reports” about their condition. Morrisey has not elaborated. 




Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, drove across the country to launch an “ambush-style” attack with a .357 Smith & Wesson revolver. 

Video reviewed by investigators showed the assailant “came around the corner” and immediately started firing at the troops, according to Jeffery Carroll, an executive assistant D.C. police chief. 

At least one Guard member exchanged gunfire with the shooter, a law enforcement official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. 

Troops ran over and held down the shooter, Carroll said, and he was taken into custody. Authorities believe he was the only gunman.




Carroll said that it was not clear whether one of the Guard members or a law enforcement officer shot the suspect and that investigators so far had no information on a motive. 

The suspect's wounds were not believed to be life-threatening, one of the officials said.

Lakanwal, 29, entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden administration program that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from the country, officials said.

The initiative brought roughly 76,000 people to the U.S., many of whom had worked alongside U.S. troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators. The program has drawn intense criticism from President Donald Trump and other Republicans over what they have argued are gaps in the vetting process and the speed of admissions. Supporters have said the initiative has offered a lifeline to people at risk of Taliban reprisals.

Prior to his arrival in the United States, the suspect worked with the U.S. government, including the CIA, “as a member of a partner force in Kandahar,” John Ratcliffe, the spy agency's director, said in a statement. 

Ratcliffe did not specify what work Lakanwal did, but said the relationship “ended shortly following the chaotic evacuation” of U.S. servicemembers from Afghanistan. 

A resident of the eastern Afghan province of Khost who identified himself as Lakanwal's cousin said Lakanwal was originally from the province. The cousin, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said Lakanwal had worked in a special Afghan Army unit known as Zero Units.

Zero Units were paramilitary units manned by Afghans but backed by the CIA and also served in front-line fighting with CIA paramilitary officers. Activists had attributed abuses to the units. They played a key role in the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from the country, providing security around Kabul International Airport as the Americans and others fell back during the Taliban offensive that seized the country.

The cousin said Lakanwal started out working as a security guard for the unit in 2012, and was later promoted to become a team leader and a GPS specialist. 

Lakanwal's former landlord, Kristina Widman, said Lakanwal had been living in Washington state with his wife and five children, according to his former landlord, Kristina Widman. 

Pirro said Lakanwal currently faces charges of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. The charges could be upgraded, she added.

“We are praying that they survive and that the highest charge will not have to be murder in the first degree. But make no mistake, if they do not, that will certainly be the charge,” she said. 

Pirro said that “it's too soon to say” what the suspect's motives were.

Soon after the shooting, Trump said he would send 500 more National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. It's not clear where the additional troops would come from. 

As of early November, the D.C. National Guard had the largest number on the ground, with 949 members. In addition to West Virginia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama also had forces in the capital early this month.

A federal judge last week ordered an end to the Guard deployment but also put her order on hold for 21 days to allow the Trump administration time to either remove the troops or appeal.

This story has been corrected to fix the spelling of the suspect's name. It is Lakanwal, not Lakamal.

U.S. President Donald Trump issued a video message after two West Virginia National Guard members deployed to Washington, D.C. were shot Wednesday afternoon just blocks from the White House. A suspect who was in custody also was shot and had wounds that were not believed to be life-threatening. Officials say the 29-year-old is an Afghan national who entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome.

WASHINGTON (AP) — An Afghan national who worked with the CIA in his native country and immigrated to the U.S. in 2021 drove from Washington state to shoot two West Virginia National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C., just blocks from the White House, U.S. officials said Thursday.

The suspect had worked in a special CIA-backed Afghan Army unit before emigrating from Afghanistan, according to a cousin who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, declined to provide a motive for Wednesday afternoon's brazen act of violence, which comes as the presence of troops in the nation's capital and other cities around the country has become a political flashpoint.

Pirro identified the guard members at a news conference as Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24. Both remained hospitalized in critical condition. 

Pirro said that the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, launched an “ambush-style” attack with a .357 Smith & Wesson revolver. The suspect currently faces charges of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. Pirro said that “it's too soon to say” what the suspect's motives were.

The charges could be upgraded, Pirro said, adding, “We are praying that they survive and that the highest charge will not have to be murder in the first degree. But make no mistake, if they do not, that will certainly be the charge.” 




The rare shooting of National Guard members on American soil, on the day before Thanksgiving, comes amid court fights and a broader public policy debate about the Trump administration's use of the military to combat what officials cast as an out-of-control crime problem.

The Trump administration quickly ordered 500 more National Guard members to Washington.

The suspect who was in custody also was shot and had wounds that were not believed to be life-threatening, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.

A resident of the eastern Afghan province of Khost who identified himself as Lakanwal's cousin said Lakanwal was originally from the province and that he and his brother had worked in a special Afghan Army unit known as Zero Unit in the southern province of Kandahar. He said he had last spoken to Lakanwal about six months ago.

The cousin spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

The cousin said both brothers had moved to the United States in 2021. He said Lakanwal had started out working as a security guard for the unit in 2012, and was later promoted to become a team leader and a GPS specialist.

Zero Units were paramilitary units manned by Afghans but backed by the CIA and also served in front-line fighting with CIA paramilitary officers. Activists had attributed abuses to the units. They played a key role in the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from the country, providing security around Kabul International Airport as the Americans and others fell back during the Taliban offensive that seized the country.

Lakanwal, 29, entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden administration program that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the U.S. withdrawal from the country, officials said.

The initiative brought roughly 76,000 people to the U.S., many of whom had worked alongside U.S. troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators. It has since faced intense scrutiny from Trump and his allies, congressional Republicans and some government watchdogs over allegations of gaps in the vetting process and the speed of admissions, even as advocates say it offered a lifeline to people at risk of Taliban reprisals.

Lakanwal has been living in Bellingham, Washington, about 79 miles (127 kilometers) north of Seattle, with his wife and five children, said his former landlord, Kristina Widman.

Prior to his 2021 arrival in the United States, the suspect worked with the U.S. government, including the CIA, “as a member of a partner force in Kandahar,” John Ratcliffe, the spy agency's director, said in a statement. He did not specify what work Lakanwal did, but said the relationship “ended shortly following the chaotic evacuation” of U.S. servicemembers from Afghanistan.

Kandahar in southern Afghanistan is in the Taliban heartland of the country. It saw fierce fighting between the Taliban and NATO forces after the U.S.-led invasion in 2001 following the al-Qaida attacks on Sept. 11. The CIA relied on Afghan staff for translation, administrative and front-line fighting with their own paramilitary officers in the war.

Wednesday night, in a video message released on social media, President Donald Trump called for the reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees who entered under the Biden administration.

“If they can't love our country, we don't want them,” he said, adding that the shooting was “a crime against our entire nation.”

FBI Director Kash Patel said the shooting is being investigated as an act of terrorism. Agents have served a series of search warrants, with Patel calling it a “coast-to-coast investigation.”

Pirro said: “We have been in constant contact with their families and have provided them with every resource needed during this difficult time.”

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser interpreted the shooting as a direct assault on America itself, rather than specifically on Trump's policies.

“Somebody drove across the country and came to Washington, D.C., to attack America,” Bower said. “That person will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.”

The shooting happened roughly two blocks northwest of the White House near a metro station. Hearing gunfire, other troops in the area ran over and held down the gunman after he was shot, Carroll said.




“It appears to be a lone gunman that raised a firearm and ambushed these members of the National Guard,” Carroll said, adding that it was not clear whether one of the guard members or a law enforcement officer shot the suspect.

“At this point, we have no other suspects,” Carroll said at a news conference.

At least one of the guard members exchanged gunfire with the shooter, said another law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Social media video shared in the immediate aftermath showed first responders performing CPR on one of the troops and treating the other on a sidewalk covered in broken glass.

Fuzzy Zoeller, a two-time major champion and one of golf's most gregarious characters whose career was tainted by a racially insensitive joke about Tiger Woods, has died, according to a longtime colleague. He was 74.

A cause of death was not immediately available. Brian Naugle, the tournament director of the Insperity Invitational in Houston, said Zoeller's daughter called him Thursday with the news.

Zoeller was the last player to win the Masters on his first attempt, a three-man playoff in 1979. He famously waved a white towel at Winged Foot in 1984 when he thought Greg Norman had beat him, only to defeat Norman in an 18-hole playoff the next day.

But it was the 1997 Masters that changed his popularity.

Woods was on his way to a watershed moment in golf with the most dominant victory in Augusta National history. Zoeller had finished his round and had a drink in hand under the oak tree by the clubhouse when he was stopped by CNN and asked for his thoughts on the 21-year-old Woods on his way to the most dominant win ever at Augusta National.

“That little boy is driving well and he's putting well. He's doing everything it takes to win. So, you know what you guys do when he gets in here? You pat him on the back and say congratulations and enjoy it and tell him not serve fried chicken next year. Got it?,” Zoeller said.

He smiled and snapped his fingers, and as he was walking away he turned and said, “Or collard greens or whatever the hell they serve.”




That moment haunted him the rest of his career. 

Zoeller apologized. Woods was traveling and it took two weeks for him to comment as the controversy festered. Zoeller later said he received death threats for years after that moment.

Writing for Golf Digest in 2008, he said it was “the worst thing I've gone through in my entire life.”

“If people wanted me to feel the same hurt I projected on others, I'm here to tell you they got their way,” Zoeller wrote. “I've cried many times. I've apologized countless times for words said in jest that just aren't a reflection of who I am. I have hundreds of friends, including people of color, who will attest to that.

“Still, I've come to terms with the fact that this incident will never, ever go away.”

It marred a career filled with two famous major titles, eight other PGA Tour titles and a Senior PGA Championship among his two PGA Tour Champions titles.

More than winning was how he went about it. Zoeller played fast and still had an easygoing nature to the way he approach the game, often whistling between shots.

He made his Masters debut in 1979 and got into a three-way playoff when Ed Sneed bogeyed the last three holes. Zoeller defeated Sneed and Tom Watson with a birdie on the second playoff hole, flinging his putter high in the air.

“I've never been to heaven, and thinking back on my life, I probably won't get a chance to go,” Zoeller once said. “I guess winning the Masters is as close as I'm going to get.”

Zoeller was locked in a duel with Norman at Winged Foot in the 1984, playing in the group behind and watching Norman make putt after putt. So when he saw Norman make a 40-footer on the 18th, he assumed it was for birdie and began waving a white towel in a moment of sportsmanship.

Only later did he realize it was for par, and Zoeller made par to force a playoff. Zoeller beat him by eight shots in the 18-hole playoff (67-75). Zoeller's lone regret was giving the towel to a kid after he finished in regulation.

“If you happen to see a grungy white towel hanging around, get it for me, will you?” he once said.

He was born Frank Urban Zoeller Jr. in New Albany, Indiana. Zoeller said his father was known only as “Fuzzy” and he was given the same name. He played at a junior college in Florida before joining the powerful Houston golf team before turning pro.

His wife, Diane, died in 2021. Zoeller has three children, including daughter Gretchen, with whom he used to play in the PNC Championship. Zoeller was awarded the Bob Jones Award by the USGA in 1985, the organization's highest honor given for distinguished sportsmanship.

Live Updates


• Federal agencies are leading a sprawling investigation into the suspect accused of critically injuring two West Virginia National Guard members in what officials called an “ambush-style” shooting yesterday in Washington, DC.
    


            • The suspect, identified as an Afghan national named Rahmanullah Lakanwal, drove across the country from his home in Bellingham, Washington,   and used a .357 revolver, according to DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro. He's in custody after being shot by another service member.
    


            • Lakanwal came to the US in 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome and was granted asylum in April. He had served as an Afghan partner to the CIA in Kandahar, the agency's director said.
    


            • In the wake of the shooting, President Donald Trump made the case for an even more intense immigration crackdown. While a motive is not yet clear, Trump has called the shooting an “act of terror.”
    


            After a gunman opened fire yesterday on two National Guard members in Washington, DC, President Donald Trump called for even more troops to be sent to the district.
    


            That all comes as a federal judge considers the legality of Trump's National Guard deployment in the first place.
    


Here's what you should know: 



DC under federal control: Back in August, Trump placed DC's police department “under direct federal control,” citing a public safety emergency after an assault on a former government worker. He announced he was deploying troops, and National Guard members began appearing in DC.
    


Legal action: DC's attorney general's office sued the Trump administration in early September over the National Guard deployment.
    


Recent ruling: Just last week, a federal judge ruled that Trump's Defense Department illegally deployed the National Guard in the district. While the order for that decision is delayed to allow time for an appeal, adding more troops would fly in the face of the order.
    


What we know about the new troops: Following the shooting, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said the president asked for 500 more service members to be deployed to DC. Hegseth will make the request to the secretary of the Army.
    


            The West Virginia National Guard today provided additional information about the two Guard members who were critically wounded in a shooting yesterday in Washington, DC.
    


            Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, began Guard service on June 26, 2023, and was assigned to the 863rd Military Police Company, 111th Engineer Brigade, West Virginia Army National Guard, a news release states.
    


            Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, joined the Guard on February 5, 2019, and was assigned to the Force Support Squadron, 167th Airlift Wing, West Virginia Air National Guard.
    


            Beckstrom, of Summersville, West Virginia, and Wolfe, of Martinsburg, West Virginia, had been deployed in the nation's capital since August when the mission there began, according to the Guard.
    


            Both remain hospitalized, state and federal officials said.
    


Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who has been identified by authorities as the suspect in the shooting, came to the US in 2021 under a program implemented by the Biden administration following the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan.
    


            He was granted asylum in April by the Trump administration, multiple law enforcement officials told CNN.
    


            Lakanwal arrived in the US on September 8, 2021, as part of a program called Operation Allies Welcome, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last night. Biden launched the program in August 2021 to protect vulnerable Afghans following the US withdrawal.
    


            Afghans admitted to the US under the program underwent extensive vetting, and those later granted asylum also underwent additional vetting before it was approved.
    


            Lakanwal was evacuated by the US military in August 2021 following the fall of Kabul and arrived under humanitarian parole, the temporary authority used to evacuate tens of thousands from the country, according to AfghanEvac, a volunteer run, non-profit organization that helped oversee the process.
    


            More than 190,000 Afghans have been resettled in the US, according to the State Department.



            Most Afghans were allowed to enter and remain in the US for two years without permanent immigration status. More than 40% of those admitted to the program were eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) because they took great risks to help the US, or were related to someone who did, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            In Lakanwal's case, he previously served in NDS-03, one of Afghanistan's elite counterterrorism units that was operated by the CIA with direct US intelligence and military support, according to AfghanEvac.
    


            Initially, Lakanwal had an active SIV application underway and had received Chief of Mission (COM) approval but had not yet been granted lawful permanent residence. Instead, he applied for asylum during the Biden administration, but application was approved under Trump.
    


            Both Lakanwal's Chief of Mission application and his asylum application required review and vetting by the US government, including the CIA, according to AfghanEvac.
    


            Before granting asylum, US Citizen and Immigration Services would have first reviewed Lakanwal's identity and background checks, biometric vetting, in-person interviews and an assessment of individualized risk and eligibility under US law, the group notes.
    


The suspect in the DC shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, had previously worked with US forces in Afghanistan, officials said Thursday, with CIA Director John Ratcliffe saying in a statement to Fox News that this included the CIA. Here's some context on the Afghans who worked with US partner forces there.



            Thousands of young Afghan men engaged in some of the most brutal operations of the American war in Afghanistan. They were often employed as contractors working directly for the US agencies like the CIA, sometimes fighting for the Afghan intelligence service, the NDS, and executing strikes based on US intelligence.
    


            Lakanwal would likely have been 18 in 2014, and so of legitimate fighting age by around 2017. By this point, the US presence in Afghanistan had reduced from hundreds of Forward Operating Bases across the country to rely more on targeted operations designed to hobble a growing Taliban insurgency by killing their leaders and key operators. These raids happened nightly, although by 2016 had reduced in intensity.
    


            Authorities have yet to specify a motivation for the attack, and scant details have been released by US officials or the CIA about Lakanwal's work for them.
    


            Still, Afghans employed by the CIA – through whatever proxy – to fight the Taliban would have been involved in some of the most high-risk and violent tasks the US military sought to execute. Afghan veterans from this fighting would be highly experienced and sullied by the conflict. The NDS ran a series of so-called “Zero Units,” which were well-trained and asked to perform some tasks the US government might have felt squeamish about.
    


            They often worked and even lived alongside US special forces, as the US presence in Afghanistan reduced and focused more on sustaining the central government's writ in the capital and regional hubs. Afghans who worked for the NDS and for US special forces can expect to have suffered the same acute combat stress and mental health issues that US veterans themselves have reported.
    


            When the Taliban swept into Kabul in August 2021, and a chaotic evacuation ensued, thousands of young men who had fought for the Americans joined the families and civilians trying to flee through the airport. Hundreds of US veterans also worked hard to ensure the Afghans they had fought alongside were among the hundred thousand people who were airlifted from Kabul.
    


            Much was made of the vetting of those who were flown from Afghanistan out to various third countries before they reached the United States. But the process on the ground in the chaos of the Kabul evacuation was, most witnesses said, hectic and partial, with planes often filled faster than the applicants could be assessed and processed. The US military had days in which to unwind its longest war, thousands of people to save, and limited time to assess the temperament, history and future prospects of every Afghan who needed to flee the Taliban.
    


            News of the shooting of two West Virginia National Guard members rattled the hometown of Andrew Wolfe, one of the victims who remains in critical condition.
    


            “It spread so quickly,” Tara Newcomb of Martinsburg, West Virginia, told CNN. She saw a post dedicated to Wolfe shared thousands of times online, she said.
    


                    “A lot of people liked him and knew him. I hope he's doing okay,” added Newcomb, who said 24-year-old Wolfe was just a few years behind her in school.
                





            Karen Moore, who works at a local diner, described Martinsburg as a “very friendly” community where “everybody wants to help everybody.”
    


            A lot of people in town are “hurt” and “upset” by the news of Wolfe's shooting, Newcomb said. “You know, they have the right to be. Something like this should have never happened.”
    


            Officials provided new details on yesterday's shooting in Washington, DC, that critically wounded two National Guard members.
    


Here's what we learned at the news conference, which wrapped up a short time ago: 



More on the suspect: The suspect, identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, lives in Bellingham, Washington, and drove across the country to carry out the attack, US Attorney for DC Jeanine Pirro said. He is a 29-year-old Afghan national admitted to the US as part of Operation Allies Welcome, and he was granted asylum in April. Lakanwal had connections to US forces in Afghanistan, according to FBI Director Kash Patel. The CIA director said earlier today that Lakanwal had worked with the agency in the country.
    


More on the victims: Pirro identified the wounded service members as 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom and 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe. Both are members of the West Virginia National Guard who were deployed in DC. They remain in critical condition and have undergone surgery.
    


Sprawling investigation: Multiple law enforcement agencies are working a “coast to coast” investigation into the shooting, according to Patel. Investigators aren't ready to name a motive for the attack, Pirro said. President Donald Trump has called the shooting “an act of terror” and quickly used the attack to make a case for an even more intense immigration crackdown.
    


Potential charges: Pirro said the suspect, who was armed with a .357 Smith and Wesson revolver, will be charged with three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. The full scope of the charges will depend in part on the condition of the service members, according to Pirro. Attorney General Pam Bondi suggested on Fox News earlier today that the administration could possibly pursue terrorism charges and the death penalty.
    


            US Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro had a message for the suspect in yesterday's shooting of two National Guard members.
    


            “You picked the wrong target, the wrong city and the wrong country, and you will be sorry for the violence and the evil that you perpetrated in our nation's capital,” she said at a news conference a short time ago.
    


Watch the moment here:



            Multiple law enforcement agencies are working a “coast to coast” investigation into how and why an Afghan national allegedly traveled from the state of Washington to Washington, DC, and shot two members of the National Guard.
    


            The suspect, identified as an Afghan national named Rahmanullah Lakanwal, drove across the country from his home in Bellingham, Washington, to DC, authorities say.
    


            “We immediately, with our law enforcement partners in the Metropolitan Police Department and the interagency, secured the scene, seized the weapon, sent in our Evidence Response Team immediately to collect evidence and started doing block-by-block canvases,” FBI Director Kash Patel said this morning.
    


            A firearm and other evidence were sent yesterday to the FBI laboratory in Quantico for analysis, Patel said.
    


            “Partnering with the DC United States Attorney's Office, we have also executed multiple … search warrants around the country to include the subject's last known residence,” said Patel.
    


            Investigators interviewed everyone in the suspect's home, he said.
    


            Interviews are also being conducted in San Diego “pursuant to our ongoing investigation,” he said.
    


            Investigators will also look into the suspect's connections to US forces in Afghanistan and any known associates in the US or overseas, the FBI director said.
    


            President Donald Trump has arrived at his West Palm Beach, Florida, golf club as the first family spends the Thanksgiving holiday at Mar-a-Lago.
    


            The president made the brief drive to Trump International Golf Club just before 10 a.m. ET.
    


            Trump was at his golf club on Wednesday when reports of a shooting near the White House began to emerge. He received regular briefings from Attorney General Pamela Bondi, she said during an appearance on Fox News Thursday morning.
    


            He delivered an address to the nation from his club late Thursday night. Trump is expected to hold the customary Thanksgiving call with US service members later Thursday.
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed that the suspect in the shooting of two US National Guard members had connections to US forces in Afghanistan.
    


            Suspect Rahmanulla Lakanwal “had a relationship in Afghanistan with partner forces,” Patel told reporters during a Thursday news conference. Lakanwal came to the United States in 2021 as part of “Operation Allies Welcome.” He applied for asylum in 2024 and it was granted in April 2025.
    


            His ties to the US in Afghanistan are part of the ongoing investigation, Patel said.
    


            “We are fully investigating that aspect of his background as well, to include any known associates that are either overseas or here in the United States of America,” he said.
    


            The two National Guard members who were shot yesterday in Washington, DC, had been on orders in the city since August, according to a statement from the West Virginia National Guard.
    


            DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro had earlier said the two service members, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom and 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, were “sworn in” just 24 hours before they were shot, but she didn't immediately clarify what she meant by that.
    


This post has been updated with details from the National Guard on the timing of the victims' deployment to Washington, DC.



            Investigators aren't ready to say what the motive was in the shooting of two members of the West Virginia National Guard in Washington, DC, according to the federal prosecutor leading the case against suspect Rahmanullah Lakanwal.
    


                    “This is a fluid investigation. People are working around the clock. It's too soon to say what the motive is, but there are definitely areas that we're looking into.”
                


                    US Attorney Jeanine Pirro
                


            Lakanwal is under guard at a DC hospital after being taken down, said Pirro.
    


            “He got shot by another guardsmen,” she said.
    


            The man authorities say opened fire on service members in Washington, DC, yesterday, gravely wounding two members of the West Virginia National Guard, will be charged with three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for the District of Columbia, said today.
    


            He faces 15 years under the assault with the intent to kill charge, Pirro said.
    


            The charges are subject to change depending on the well-being of the wounded Guard members, according to Pirro.
    


            “We are praying that they survive and that the highest charge will not have to be murder in the first degree,” she said, adding, “We will hold this perpetrator accountable under the full weight of the law.”
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News earlier today that the administration could pursue terrorism charges and possibly the death penalty in the case.
    


            The two National Guard members shot in Washington, DC, are in critical condition and have undergone surgery, US Attorney for DC Jeanine Pirro said this morning.
    


            Pirro identified the victims of yesterday's shooting as 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom and 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe. Both are members of the West Virginia National Guard who were deployed in DC.
    


            The two National Guard members shot in Washington, DC, are in critical condition and have undergone surgery, US Attorney for DC Jeanine Pirro said this morning.
    


                    “We pray for their well-being as they continue to be cared for in the best possible way. We have been in constant contact with their families, and have provided them with every resource needed during this difficult time,” Pirro said at a news conference.
                





This post has been updated with the names of the service members shot in DC yesterday.



            The suspect in the shooting of two members of the West Virginia National Guard on patrol in Washington, DC, on Wednesday lives in Bellingham, Washington, US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said in a news conference.
    


Rahmanullah Lakanwal is a 29-year-old Afghan national admitted to the US as part of Operation Allies Welcome, said Pirro.
    


                    “What we know about him is that he drove his vehicle across country from the state of Washington with the intended target of coming to our nation's capital,” Pirro said.
                





            Lakanwal resides in Bellingham with his wife and children, Pirro added.
    


            The suspected gunman in yesterday's shooting was armed with a .357 Smith and Wesson revolver, according to DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro.
    


            “Two uniformed guardsmen were ambushed in a brazen and targeted attack,” she said during a news conference today.
    


            “A lone gunman opened fire without provocation, ambush-style, armed with a .357 Smith and Wesson revolver. One guardsman is struck, goes down and then the shooter leans over and strikes the guardsman again. Another guardsman is struck several times,” Pirro said.
    


            Other National Guard members who were at the scene “responded immediately,” Pirro added.
    


            As two National Guard members lie in critical condition in DC-area hospitals, Attorney General Pamela Bondi said today she would seek the death penalty for their alleged shooter.
    


            “Pray today for these two soldiers, these two guards, the man and woman,” Bondi told Fox News.
    


                    “But if something happens, I will tell you right now, I will tell you early. We will do everything in our power to seek the death penalty against that monster who should not have been in our country.”
                





            The suspect in the shooting has been identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who officials say came to the US in 2021. He was also wounded and taken to a hospital yesterday, authorities said.
    


            “We're waiting right now, of course, on the prognosis of the young man and  woman who are in the hospital,” Bondi said.
    


            “So it is going to depend on, on what happens to them. Again we're praying for a recovery for them, but worst case scenario, minimum, life in prison with terrorism charges,” she said, adding there is still a very active investigation.
    


This post has been updated with additional information.



            Attorney General Pam Bondi shared new details on the robust federal investigation into the shooting of two National Guard members near the White House yesterday, involving multiple departments and agencies.
    


            Bondi said in an appearance on Fox News today that in addition to the National Guard and Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Department of Homeland Security, US Marshals, and the Department of Treasury are involved in the ongoing investigation.
    


                    “We are working together, and we will not be deterred,” Bondi said.
                





            The attorney general said she has spoken multiple times with President Donald Trump as well as DC Mayor Muriel Bowser. She praised the DC Metropolitan Police Department, who she said, “jumped in last night to have the backs of our Guard members, who have always had their backs.”
    


            One of the West Virginia National Guard members shot in Washington, DC, was female, Attorney General Pam Bondi said.
    


            Bondi told Fox News on Thursday that one of the victims was a “young woman” who had volunteered to work in the nation's capital over the Thanksgiving holiday.
    


            “She volunteered, as did many of those guardsmen and women, so other people could be home with their families, yet now their families are in hospital rooms with them while they are fighting for their lives,” she said.
    


            While the shooting of two members of the National Guard in Washington, DC, is at the top of mind, New York City's top police officer says there are “no known specific credible threats” to the city's Thanksgiving parade this year.
    


            “Unfortunately, (the DC shooting) is part of a growing trend that we've seen over the past year: increased attacks on our men and women in uniform,” Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch told NBC's “Today” show this morning. “That's baked into our planning already for this event.”
    


            Tisch said thousands of NYPD officers will be working to protect the parade route. “Some that you can see. Many that you won't be able to see,” she said.

LONDON (AP) — A rare crystal and diamond Fabergé egg crafted for Russia's ruling family before it was toppled by revolution is going up for auction, valued at more than 20 million pounds ($26.4 million).

Christie's auction house says the Winter Egg is just one of seven of the opulent ovoids remaining in private hands. It will be offered for sale at Christie's London headquarters on Tuesday.

The 4-inch (10-centimeter) tall egg is made from finely carved rock crystal, covered in a delicate snowflake motif wrought in platinum and 4,500 tiny diamonds. It opens to reveal a removable tiny basket of bejewelled quartz flowers symbolizing spring. 

Margo Oganesian, the head of Christie's Russian art department, likened it to a luxurious Kinder Surprise chocolate.

The Winter Egg is a superb example of craft and design, “the ‘Mona Lisa' for decorative arts,” Oganesian said.

One of just two created by female designer Alma Pihl, the egg was commissioned by Czar Nicholas II for his mother Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna as an Easter present in 1913. Pihl's other egg is owned by Britain's royal family.

Craftsman Peter Carl Fabergé and his company created more than 50 of the eggs for Russia's imperial family between 1885 and 1917, each elaborately unique and containing a hidden surprise. Czar Alexander III started the tradition by presenting an egg to his wife each Easter. His successor, Nicholas II, extended the gift to his wife and mother.

The Romanov royal family ruled Russia for 300 years before it was ousted by the 1917 revolution. Nicholas and his family were executed in 1918.




Bought by a London dealer for 450 pounds when the cash-strapped Communist authorities sold off some of Russia's artistic treasures in the 1920s, the egg changed hands several times. It was believed lost for two decades until it was auctioned by Christie's in 1994 for more than 7 million Swiss francs ($5.6 million at the time). It sold again in 2002 for $9.6 million.

Now it is expected to surpass the record $18.5 million paid at a 2007 Christie's auction for another Fabergé egg created for the Rothschild banking family.

There are 43 surviving imperial Fabergé eggs, most in museums.

Two National Guardsmen remain in critical condition Thursday after a "targeted shooting" in Washington, D.C., Wednesday afternoon. The alleged gunman, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, has been taken into custody. Lakanawal entered the U.S. under a visa program pushed by former President Joe Biden.

Covered by: Anders Hagstrom

Two West Virginia National Guard
 members remain in critical condition Thursday morning after being shot just blocks from the White House the day before Thanksgiving.

The servicemembers have been identified as Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24. They had been sworn in less than 24 hours before the attack.

FBI Director Kash Patel said both Guard members are in critical condition. Earlier Wednesday, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said they had died, but then said he had been receiving conflicting reports about their condition.

The suspect taken into custody has been identified as Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal, three law enforcement sources told Fox News Digital.


Lakanwal entered the U.S. legally in 2021 under humanitarian parole as part of the Biden administration's Operation Allies Welcome in the aftermath of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

The White House was placed on lockdown following the shooting, and President Donald Trump was in Florida during the incident.

Former DOJ prosecutor Jim Trusty joined "Fox News Live" to weigh in on the investigation into the D.C. shooting of two National Guardsmen, describing an FBI-led, multi-state investigation that could move into the federal court.

Trusty said investigators will be interviewing the suspect's friends, loved ones and current and past employers. The suspect, 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is currently in police custody.

Lakanwal entered the the country from Afghanistan in 2021 following the U.S. military withdrawal.



Sarah Beckstrom.



Sarah Beckstrom, one of the National Guard members shot in the nation's capital on Wednesday, suffered a mortal wound and is not likely to recover, her father told The New York Times on Thursday.

"I'm holding her hand right now," Gary Beckstrom told the outlet in a phone interview. "She has a mortal wound. It's not going to be a recovery."

The status of Andrew Wolfe, the other guard member shot on Wednesday, remains unclear, though he is also in critical condition.

U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro says charges against suspect Rahmanullah Lakanwal will be raised to first degree murder if either of the victims die.





The suspect in Wednesday's shooting of National Guard troops in the nation's capital was "clean on all checks" in a 2021 background check before he came to the U.S., a senior U.S. official told Fox News.

29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal
 entered the U.S. through former President Joe Biden's Operation Allies Welcome in 2021 during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. During that transition, officials say Lakanwal would have undergone a vetting check by the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC).

“In terms of vetting, nothing came up,” the official said. “He was clean on all checks.”

Prior to his arrival in the U.S., Lakanwal worked with the CIA in Afghanistan, beginning that work as early as 2011. Officials say was not uncommon for Afghans to falsify their age given the poor recordkeeping by the Afghan government.

The official said the U.S. continued an annual vetting process for Afghan evacuees even after they arrived in the U.S., an effort that was redoubled after a foiled terror plot in Oklahoma last year that was linked to another Afghan national.





New Yorker writer Jane Mayer was called out for her reaction to two members of the National Guard being shot in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, as she suggested the tragedy's blame lay at the feet of the Trump administration.

"This is so tragic, so unnecessary, these poor guardsmen should never have been deployed. I live in DC and watched as they had virtually nothing to do but pick up trash. It was for political show and at what a cost," Mayer said in a post for X.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national, has been identified as the gunman accused of shooting the two National Guard members just blocks from the White House on the day before Thanksgiving, law enforcement sources told Fox News Digital.


Trump White House Communications Director Steven Cheung responded to Mayer's post and said, "Jane, respectfully, shut the f--- up for trying to politicize this tragedy. They were protecting DC and trying to make the nation's capital safer. People like you who engage in ghoulish behavior lose all credibility. Not like you had any to begin with."

The administration's Rapid Response account on X criticized Mayer, calling the journalist a "disgusting ghoul."

Ben Williamson, the assistant director for public affairs at the FBI, also condemned Mayer's response.

"If you sat down and tried to come up with a disgraceful response it would be damn near impossible to hit this level. Two guardsmen shot in broad daylight and you not only blame their deployment but then lie to trash and downplay their successful service. Delete your account," he wrote.


Mayer also responded to a post that pointed to the number of homicides in D.C. this year, compared to the number from last year, and accused the person of "mansplaining."

"I've covered crime in Washington since 1981- let's skip the mansplaining. You can play with the stats but homicides were dropping before the troops got here," Mayer wrote. 





The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under former President Joe Biden promised to "swiftly and safely" resettle Afghan allies into the United States, but multiple sources have confirmed the D.C. National Guard shooter came in under that same Biden-era program in 2021.


Biden responded to the "targeted" attack in D.C. just before news broke of how the alleged shooter, 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal, entered the United States under humanitarian parole via Operation Allies Welcome, per DHS and FBI sources, giving him permission to be in the country legally. 

In 2021, amid the Afghan withdrawal debacle, Biden's Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas promised to "swiftly and safely" resettle thousands of Afghan allies into the United States and confirmed that DHS had denied evacuees from entering the U.S. due to "derogatory" information obtained during the vetting process.

After the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan that was followed by a Taliban takeover of the country, the Biden administration launched a large operation to support and resettle vulnerable Afghans, including those that had helped U.S. troops in the past. 


Due to the rushed nature of the evacuation, plus broader concerns over immigration and parole-release policies, fears arose over whom the country may have been letting in. 

Mayorkas said during a September 2021 press conference that 120,000 people had been evacuated from Afghanistan since the beginning of the U.S. withdrawal, just months earlier. The Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center found that nearly 800 aircraft evacuated thousands of people over just a 17-day period in August 2021.

At the time, Mayorkas touted the robust biometric screening and vetting process in place — in both the U.S. and transit countries — in order to make sure every individual entering the country was properly screened. 

In response to a question at the time from Fox News' Jake Gibson, Mayorkas confirmed that there already had been individuals flagged with "derogatory information" during the vetting process, but did not specify the number of people flagged.


Mayorkas assured that 400 U.S. Customs and Border Patrol employees and the Transportation Security Administration would be brought up to assist. Part of the effort included moving refugees from military bases designated by the Pentagon to house and vet refugees before they entered the United States.





The suspect in Wednesday's shooting of National Guard members in Washington, D.C., was vetted by the CIA in Afghanistan and was granted final asylum approval under President Donald Trump's administration, multiple sources told Fox News Digital.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed earlier Wednesday that the alleged shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, worked for the CIA in Afghanistan out of a base in Kandahar. Multiple sources tell Fox that prior to that work, Lakanwal was vetted by the National Counterterrorism Center.

During the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, the CIA and U.S. military airlifted many so-called Afghan allies out of the country. Priority was given to those who had badges and a history of working with the CIA, such as Lakanwal.

While further vetting took place for most Afghans who were airlifted out, sources say having a CIA badge would have placed Lakanwal in the "vetted" category. Sources said there was nothing in Lakanwal's history to suggest he had links to terrorism prior to his entry to the U.S. in September 2021.


Lakanwal applied for asylum in 2024 and reportedly received approval in April, under President Donald Trump's administration.

FBI Director 
Kash Patel and U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro had harsh words for the Biden-era program that allowed the suspect in the National Guard shooting to enter the U.S.

Patel and Pirro delivered an update on the case in a Thursday morning press conference. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, entered the country following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan under former President Joe Biden's "Operation Allies Welcome."

"This individual is in this country for one reason and one reason alone, because of the disastrous withdrawal from the Biden administration and the failure to vet in any way, in any way, shape or form this individual and countless others, and this administration has taken the rightful step to stop any further allowance of people with this similar background into the country," Patel said.


"You miss all the signs when you do absolutely zero vetting. And that's exactly what happened in this case when you in the prior administration, made the decision to allow thousands of people into this country without doing a single piece of background checking or vetting, that's how you miss every single sign," he continued.

Pirro likewise called the Biden-era program "ridiculous."





The two young National Guard members who were shot in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday were sworn into service less than 24 hours before the attack.

U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro made the announcement during a press conference Thursday morning. She identified the two servicemembers as Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24.

"Okay, I also want to say that both Sarah and Andrew, I believe, were sworn in less than 24 hours before they were shot on the street in Washington," Pirro said Thursday.

Both Beckstrom and Wolfe are out of surgery and remain in critical condition.

Pirro and FBI Director Kash Patel say the charges against the suspect will hang on whether Beckstrom and Wolfe survive their injuries.





U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro identified the two National Guard members who were shot in the nation's capital on Thursday.


Pirro says the two West Virginia guard members are Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24. Both servicemembers have received surgery but remain in critical condition, she said.

"Sarah and Andrew volunteered. They came here to protect the district," Pirro said. "Our nation's capital should not and must not be a place where evil comes to commit violence regardless of what their motives may be."

Beckstrom and Wolfe had been sworn in as a National Guard member less than 24 hours before the attack.

She went on to echo Attorney General Pam Bondi in saying the charges against the suspect depend on the condition of Backstrom and Wolfe, and she called on Americans to pray for their recovery.

Pirro also condemned the Biden-era immigration program that allowed the suspected shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, to enter the U.S.


Lakanwal is an Afghan national who was granted entrance to the U.S. following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan under former President Joe Biden's "Operation Allies Welcome."

FBI Director Kash Patel says authorities have executed a search warrant at Lakanwal's residence in Washington state, and interviews with residents there are ongoing.





Attorney General Pam Bondi
 says the Justice Department will do "everything in our power" to seek the death penalty for the Afghan national alleged to have shot two National Guard members in Washington, D.C.

Bondi made the comments during a Thursday morning appearance on "Fox & Friends," saying that the two victims are out of surgery but their prognosis remains unclear. The alleged attacker, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, remains in custody.

"We will base our charges based on their prognosis, you know, they both came through surgery. I'm not going to talk about their conditions right now," Bondi said.

"But if something happens, I will tell you right now. I will tell you early. We will do everything in our power to seek the death penalty against that monster who should not have been in our country," she added.


Bondi confirmed that the two West Virginia servicemembers are a man and a woman, but their identities are remaining private for the sake of their families. Bondi said the woman had volunteered to work in the nation's capital over Thanksgiving.


Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national, has been identified as the gunman accused of shooting two National Guard members just blocks from the White House on the day before Thanksgiving, law enforcement sources told Fox News Digital.

Lakanwal was taken into custody Wednesday, while authorities said both Guard members were in critical condition. Officials said the shooting is being investigated as a possible act of international terrorism.

More details about Lakanwal have slowly come to light in the hours after the shooting.


Lakanwal entered the U.S. legally in 2021 under humanitarian parole as part of the Biden administration's Operation Allies Welcome, following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban takeover of the country. The operation aimed to support and resettle vulnerable Afghans, including those that had helped U.S. troops in the past. 

The suspect reportedly had his asylum application approved during the Trump administration.

Intelligence sources told Fox News Digital that Lakanwal had a prior relationship with various entities in the U.S. government, including the CIA, due to his work as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.


"In the wake of the disastrous Biden withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Biden administration justified bringing the alleged shooter to the United States in September 2021 due to his prior work with the U.S. government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar, which ended shortly following the chaotic evacuation," CIA Director John Ratcliffe told Fox News Digital.

Lakanwal had been living in Washington state, two law enforcement officials and a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.

His former landlord, Kristina Widman, told the outlet that Lakamal arrived in Bellingham, Wash., about four years ago with his wife and five children.

How he traveled the roughly 2,500 miles to Washington, D.C., ahead of Wednesday's shooting remains unclear.

This is an excerpt from an article by Fox News' Stephen Sorace.





Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Va., accused the Trump administration of taking "its eye off the ball" on public safety following the Washington, D.C., shooting on Wednesday.

While appearing on CNN's "The Lead with Jake Tapper," Walkinshaw was asked about whether the recent shooting changed his thoughts about the safety of National Guard officers deployed in the city.


"Well, look, obviously, as I said, most of us certainly on the Democratic side in Congress don‘t think we should have National Guardsmen and women in our cities," Walkinshaw said. "But if that‘s going to happen and when that‘s going to happen, I think it‘s incumbent upon the administration to lay out a clear plan to ensure their protection. And one of my concerns that I intend to raise as a new member of the Homeland Security Committee is the way in which the Trump administration has taken its eye off the ball in a lot of critical public safety areas and shifted resources to their mass deportation efforts."

He continued, "So they‘re shifting resources away from illegal gun trafficking, from transnational crime, from anti-terrorism, both domestic and foreign. And they need to get their eyes back on the ball and focus on keeping all of us here in the United States of America safe."


Walkinshaw reiterated that he still does not believe National Guard members are needed in the city and urged the Trump administration to redirect those resources elsewhere.

"There are a lot of things that the federal government could do to help keep Washington, D.C., safe, and other cities across the country safe," Walkinshaw said. "I mentioned some of those things. They could do more, much more to crack down on illegal gun trafficking. They could do much more to prevent human trafficking and child sex trafficking. They‘re taking their eyes off of that ball. I think that‘s a better use of the federal resources than National Guardsmen and women in American cities, including the District of Columbia."

Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment.

President Donald Trump expressed gratitude to the U.S. military following an attack on service members in Washington, D.C., that left two National Guard members in critical condition.

"They have taken a selfless oath to defend our nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic," Trump said Wednesday night. "And that is exactly what they were doing when they were gunned down in a savage attack."

"I want to express my extraordinary gratitude to every member of the United States military who is deployed tonight at home and abroad," he continued.

"Fox News @ Night" host Kevin Corke said he thought Trump struck "the right tone" with his message.

U.S. Air Force Brigadier General (ret.) John Teichert called Wednesday's attack a "crime against our nation and against humanity."






Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.V., said the federal government needs to immediately review every special visa applicant who was allowed to enter the country during the Biden administration, after an Afghan national was accused of shooting two National Guard members on Wednesday.

"Absolutely sickening," Justice wrote on X. "If these new reports are true, this 'Afghan national' ambushed West Virginia service members in broad daylight—the very ones defending my home state, DC, and beyond."


"We need to immediately review each and every special visa applicant who was allowed in under the former administration. This can't happen again," he added.

The alleged gunman entered the U.S. legally in 2021 under humanitarian parole as part of the Biden administration's Operation Allies Welcome, following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The suspect reportedly had his asylum application approved during the Trump administration.

FBI Director Kash Patel and U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro held a press conference on Thanksgiving, revealing a slew of details about the terrorist attack on National Guard members.

Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, were shot in the head on Wednesday while patrolling the street immediately outside the White House in Washington, D.C. Both of them are now in critical condition.

“If one of them is to pass — and God forbid that happens — this is a murder one. Period. End of the story,” Pirro, the US Attorney for D.C., told reporters on Thursday.

Pirro added that both Beckstrom and Wolfe had been sworn in for duty less than 24 hours before they were shot.

Authorities have identified 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national, as the shooter. He was wounded during the attack and transported to the hospital.

Lakanwal allegedly drove to D.C. from his home in Seattle, Washington, before committing the attack. He is facing three counts of assault with intent to kill while armed and one count of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence.

Patel said his bureau is undertaking a “coast-to-coast investigation” based out of D.C., due to the cross-country nature of Lakanwal's route.

“This is an ongoing investigation of terrorism, make no mistake about it,” Patel said. “We have also executed multiple search warrants around the country, to include the subject's last known residence, which is in state of Washington.”

President Donald Trump has blamed the violence on former President Joe Biden's administration, saying they let “unknown and unvetted foreigners” into the country.

Lakanwal was let into the country in 2021 as part of Operation Allies Welcome, a program that brought 76,000 evacuated Afghans into the U.S. on humanitarian grounds. The government granted him asylum status earlier this year.

Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki assured reporters in 2021 that the thousands of Afghan refugees would be thoroughly screened before arriving in the U.S.

“I can absolutely assure you that no one is coming into the United States of America who has not been through a thorough screening and background check process,” Psaki said at the time.

Patel told reporters at the Thursday press conference that Department of War officials have informed him of evidence that “the suspect had a relationship in Afghanistan with partner forces” and the FBI is “looking into it.”

Asked at the Thursday press conference whether the U.S. government missed any warning signs when allowing Lakanwal into the country, Patel responded: “You miss all the signs when you do zero vetting.” 

ALLEGED DC NATIONAL GUARD SHOOTING SUSPECT PREVIOUSLY WORKED FOR CIA

He added, “The prior administration made the decision to allow thousands of people into this country without doing a single piece of background checking or vetting — that's how you miss every single sign.”

Vice President JD Vance also blamed the Biden administration on social media following the shooting, writing: “I remember back in 2021 criticizing the Biden policy of opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees. Friends sent me messages calling me a racist. It was a clarifying moment. They shouldn't have been in our country.”

U.S. proposals to end the war between Russia and Ukraine offer a starting point for talks, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday, as he told Ukrainian forces to pull back or be overrun by Russia's bigger army.

“We need to sit down and discuss this seriously,” Putin told reporters at the end of a three-day visit to Kyrgyzstan. “Every word matters.”

He described U.S. President Donald Trump's plan as “a set of issues put forward for discussion” rather than a draft agreement.

“If Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they occupy, hostilities will cease. If they don't withdraw, we will achieve this by force,” the Russian leader said.

Kremlin officials have had little to say so far about the peace plan put forward last week by Trump. Since Russia's invasion of its neighbor, Putin has shown no willingness to budge from his goals in Ukraine despite Trump's push for a settlement.

Putin has previously demanded that Ukraine completely withdraw from the entirety of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia regions before Russia considers any sort of “peace negotiations” — notably including areas of each of those oblasts that Russia does not occupy. He also wants to keep Ukraine from joining NATO and hosting any Western troops, allowing Moscow to gradually pull the country back into its orbit.

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to visit Moscow next week, the Kremlin says, while U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, who in recent weeks has played a high-profile role in the peace efforts, may be heading to Kyiv.




The initial U.S. peace proposals appeared heavily skewed toward Russian demands, but an amended version emerged from talks in Geneva on Sunday between American and Ukrainian officials. Sidelined European leaders, fearing for their own security amid Russian aggression, are angling for deeper involvement in the process.

Analysts say Putin is attempting to outwait the commitment of Western countries to supporting Ukraine's war effort. Trump has previously signaled he could walk away from efforts to stop the fighting if there is no progress. European officials say Putin is stalling because Russia wants to grab more of Ukraine before accepting any deal.

Russian officials have claimed they have battlefield momentum in Ukraine, even though their slow progress has been costly in terms of casualties and armor.

The Institute for the Study of War on Wednesday cast doubt on Russian claims that its invasion is unstoppable as it is still struggling to capture cities in the eastern Donetsk region.

“Data on Russian forces' rate of advance indicates that a Russian military victory in Ukraine is not inevitable, and a rapid Russian seizure of the rest of Donetsk Oblast (region) is not imminent,” the Washington-based think tank said. “Recent Russian advances elsewhere on the front line have largely been opportunistic and exploited seasonal weather conditions.”

In the latest example of tension between Moscow and European countries, Russia's Foreign Ministry said Thursday that it had ordered the closure of Poland's Consulate General in the eastern city of Irkutsk.

The tit-for-tat move follows the closure of Russia's Consulate General in the Polish city of Gdansk in November. In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that Moscow would not “allow such actions to go unanswered.”

Poland announced the closure of the Gdansk consulate after a railway line close to Warsaw was sabotaged in mid-November. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk later said that two Ukrainian citizens working for Russia were suspected of carrying out the attack.

The diplomatic developments have come against a backdrop of continued fighting.

A 53-year-old man was killed in a Russian drone attack in Ukraine's northern Sumy region, officials said Friday. Also, Russia attacked Ukraine's Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk regions early Thursday, injuring three people and starting fires, local authorities said. Russia launched 142 drones at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine's air force.

Meanwhile, Russian air defenses downed 118 Ukrainian drones overnight above various Russian regions and the Black Sea, the Russian Defense Ministry said.

Ukraine's army isn't only under pressure on the battlefield. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government is mired in a major corruption scandal and is short of money.

In a development offering some relief, Ukraine reached an agreement for the International Monetary Fund to provide $8.1 billion over four years, according to a statement by the institution. The money comes from a fund that helps countries facing medium-term payment difficulties.

But Ukraine's state budget and military needs for 2026 and 2027 are estimated at $153 billion.

Swapping turkeys for other animals was once a key part of North America's wildlife conservation efforts. Thanks to these trades, the wild turkey population has grown to about 7 million birds in 49 states.

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — No one wants a weasel on their Thanksgiving table, but swapping turkeys for other animals was once surprisingly common.

Trading turkeys – for wildlife management, not dinner – was a key part of one of North America's biggest conservation success stories. After dwindling to a few thousand birds in the late 1880s, the wild turkey population has grown to about 7 million birds in 49 states, plus more in Canada and Mexico, according to the National Wild Turkey Federation.

In many cases, restoration relied on trades. The exchange rates varied, but Oklahoma once swapped walleye and prairie chickens for turkeys from Arkansas and Missouri. Colorado traded mountain goats for turkeys from Idaho. The Canadian province of Ontario ended up with 274 turkeys from New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Michigan, Missouri and Iowa in exchange for moose, river otters, and partridge.

“Wildlife biologists don't suffer from a lack of creativity,” said Patt Dorsey, director of conservation for the National Wild Turkey Federation's western region.

West Virginia in particular appears to have had an abundance of turkeys to share. In 1969, it sent 26 turkeys to New Hampshire in exchange for 25 fishers, a member of the weasel family once prized for its pelt. Later trades involved otters and bobwhite quail.

“They were like our currency for all our wildlife that we restored,” said Holly Morris, furbearer and small game project leader at the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources. “It's just a way to help out other agencies. We're all in the same mission.”

Wild turkeys were abundant across the U.S. until the mid-1800s, when the clearing of forestland and unregulated hunting led the population to plummet. Early restoration efforts in the 1940s and 50s involved raising turkeys on farms, but that didn't work well, Dorsey said.




“Turkeys that had been raised in a pen didn't do very well in the wild,” she said. “That's when we started capturing them out of the wild and moving them around to other places to restore their population, and they really took off.”

In New Hampshire, wild turkeys hadn't been seen for more than 100 years when the state got the West Virginia flock. Though those birds quickly succumbed to a harsh winter, another flock sent from New York in 1975 fared better. With careful management that included moving birds around the state dozens of times over the ensuing decades, the population has grown to roughly 40,000 birds, said Dan Ellingwood, a biologist with the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department. That's likely well beyond the expectations at the time of reintroduction, he said.

“Turkeys are incredibly adaptive,” he said. “Winter severity has changed, the landscape has changed, and yet the population really took off.”

Turkeys play an important role in a healthy ecosystem as both predator and prey, he said, and are a popular draw for hunters. But the restoration effort also is important just for the sake of ensuring native species continue to persist, he said.

Dorsey, at the National Wild Turkey Federation agreed, noting that turkey restoration projects also helped states revive their populations of other species.

“A lot of good work gets done on the back of the wild turkey,” she said.

Ex-NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Philip Breedlove (Ret.) criticized the idea that Ukraine might concede territory to Russia under a U.S.-backed peace plan, arguing Putin views Ukraine as a Russian province and has no incentive to reverse course.

As the United States advances a revised peace framework aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, officials and experts from Kyiv, Moscow and Washington tell Fox News Digital the effort is closer to a breakthrough than at any point since Russia's invasion — but still stalled by the same immovable obstacle: the Kremlin wants Ukrainian land, and Ukraine refuses to surrender any of it.

President Donald Trump said this week that "tremendous progress" has been made, announcing that his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will meet Russian officials in Moscow while senior U.S. defense leaders sit down with their Ukrainian counterparts. A senior American official confirmed to Fox News Digital that Kyiv has accepted the "broad contours" of an emerging deal, with "minor details" still being negotiated. European allies say they are coordinating a new "Coalition of the Willing," with France calling for a "just and lasting peace."

But as Russia launches fresh missile and drone strikes on Kyiv — killing civilians and damaging power infrastructure — negotiators warn that the territorial question remains the hard red line.

US AND RUSSIA DRAFT PEACE PLAN FOR UKRAINE REQUIRING MAJOR CONCESSIONS FROM KYIV

Oleksii Honcharenko, an opposition member of Ukraine's Parliament, told Fox News Digital he believes Ukraine must pursue peace "as soon as possible," even though large segments of Ukrainian society distrust the emerging plan. "My personal position is that we need peace as soon as possible," he said. "This plan is a chance. I don't like everything in it… some things are unacceptable. But it is a workable framework."

He pushed back on criticism that the "peace proposal" is a U.S.-Russia blueprint imposed on Kyiv. "For me, it doesn't matter who the initial author was. There is a framework. Let's work on it."

Honcharenko acknowledged that sanctions relief — one of Russia's core demands — would be painful for Ukrainians. But he also underscored the reality of the battlefield: "We are not in the position where our tanks are near Moscow. There will not be a solution I like completely."

Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., a House Foreign Affairs committee member, told Fox News Digital the situation reinforces the need for strong American leadership. "Russia invaded Ukraine because Joe Biden was the weakest president in American history."

Barr, a candidate for U.S. Senate in Kentucky said, "President Trump's peace-through-strength leadership kept Putin fully contained. This war never would have happened under his watch. Trump is the peace president… the only leader who can end this war and bring stability back to Europe."

Exiled Russian economist and former deputy finance minister Sergey Aleksashenko echoed the main roadblock: "The biggest difference is territorial," he told Fox News Digital. "Russia wants to grab what it was not able to take by military means. Ukraine does not want to give up. All other points could be resolved, but not territory."

TRUMP TOUTS 'PROGRESS' ON UKRAINE-RUSSIA DEAL, ADMITS IT'S 'ONE OF THE MORE DIFFICULT' CONFLICTS TO SOLVE

He said he sees no sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin is prepared to compromise, arguing the Kremlin believes Western support for Ukraine is weakening. Putin may be willing to fight "another two, three years," convinced he can outlast Kyiv and European governments struggling to maintain military aid.

Retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, the former NATO supreme allied commander, told Fox News Digital he doesn't see Ukraine agreeing to give Russia land Russia has never conquered. "It is an incredibly, incredibly bad thought," he said.

Breedlove argued that Putin's goals extend far beyond Ukraine and that the Russian president has been clear about wanting to reshape the security order in Eastern Europe. He also warned that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is negotiating under heavy pressure from Western governments that control Ukraine's access to weapons and funding.

"It's very clear he's being threatened with no support," Breedlove said. "If Mr. Zelenskyy loses the support of America and Europe, life's going to be really ugly for Ukraine. But they will not stop fighting."

He said early versions of the U.S. proposal included "egregious" provisions that Ukraine never would have agreed to, but that the process has "improved" as Kyiv's input was incorporated. Still, "the things that are acceptable to Ukraine are not going to be acceptable to Mr. Putin," he said.

Breedlove pushed back on the claim that Kyiv is ready to concede territory, saying lawmakers want peace but not capitulation. "I believe there are many parliamentary hearings and many in Zelenskyy's group that want peace, but they want a durable, equitable peace. I'm not sure that they're ready to make a lot of concessions to do that," he said.

As negotiators move toward what they hope will be a final round of talks, all sides agree on one point: the success or failure of this effort will depend on whether Ukraine and Russia — under pressure from allies, including incentives from Washington and the realities of the battlefield — can finally bridge the territorial divide that has defined the war from day one.

Former Yuma sector border patrol chief Chris Clem joins 'Fox News Live' to react to the attack on National Guards in Washington, D.C. and the impact of illegal immigration under the Biden administration.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national, has been identified as the gunman accused of shooting two National Guard members just blocks from the White House on the day before Thanksgiving, law enforcement sources told Fox News Digital.

Lakanwal was taken into custody Wednesday, while authorities said both Guard members were in critical condition. Officials said the shooting is being investigated as a possible act of international terrorism.

More details about Lakanwal have slowly come to light in the hours after the shooting.

Lakanwal entered the U.S. legally in 2021 under humanitarian parole as part of the Biden administration's Operation Allies Welcome, following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban takeover of the country. The operation aimed to support and resettle vulnerable Afghans, including those that had helped U.S. troops in the past. 

The suspect reportedly had his asylum application approved during the Trump administration.

Intelligence sources told Fox News Digital that Lakanwal had a prior relationship with various entities in the U.S. government, including the CIA, due to his work as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.

WHITE HOUSE BLASTS MS NOW CORRESPONDENT'S 'BEYOND SICK' REACTION TO DC SHOOTING OF NATIONAL GUARDSMEN

"In the wake of the disastrous Biden withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Biden administration justified bringing the alleged shooter to the United States in September 2021 due to his prior work with the U.S. government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar, which ended shortly following the chaotic evacuation," CIA Director John Ratcliffe told Fox News Digital.

Lakanwal had been living in Bellingham, Washington with his wife and five children, federal authorities said Thursday.

He drove his vehicle roughly 2,500 miles across the country to Washington, D.C., before Wednesday's shooting, officials said.

Jeffery Carroll, an executive assistant D.C. police chief, said investigators reviewed video that shows the attacker "came around the corner" and immediately started firing at the Guardsmen. Other Guardsmen ran over and tackled the shooter, and he was taken into custody. Investigators believe he was the only gunman.

U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said a responding Guardsman shot and wounded the suspect. He was hospitalized and placed under "heavy guard," she said.

No motive has been established in the shooting as of Thursday morning.

The alleged gunman was "severely wounded" before being taken into custody, President Donald Trump posted to his Truth Social account Wednesday afternoon.

Trump later said the "heinous assault" was an "act of evil and [an] act of hatred and an act of terror. It was a crime against our entire nation. It was a crime against humanity."

Pope Leo XIV is in Turkey on his first foreign trip, fulfilling the late Pope Francis' plans to mark an important Christian anniversary and bring a message of peace to the region at a crucial time for efforts to end the war in Ukraine and ease Mideast tensions.

Speaking to reporters on board his plane, Leo acknowledged the historic nature of his first foreign trip and said he has been looking forward to it because of what it means for Christians and for peace in the world.

Leo's visit comes as Turkey, a country of more than 85 million people of predominantly Sunni Muslims, has cast itself as a key intermediary in peace negotiations for the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.

What to know:








Pope Leo XIV's plane left for Istanbul after the completion of official engagements in the capital Ankara.

Turkey's Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy bid him farewell on the tarmac. 

On Friday, the pope will visit a Catholic church, a hospice and the Vatican's representation in Istanbul before traveling to Iznik, southeast of Istanbul, to participate in the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke out against discrimination of Muslims, which he said was fueled by populist politicians, the media and social platforms.

“This sensitive issue, often ignored due to political concerns, must be considered carefully, as it could reach a more serious dimensions in the future,” Erdogan said in his address to Pope Leo XIV and other dignitaries at the library of the Turkish presidential palace complex.

Erdogan welcomed the fact that Leo would visit Istanbul's Blue Mosque on Friday — as did his predecessor, Pope Francis — saying he regarded it as a “symbol” of the pontiff's intension to build “constructive ties with Muslims.”

In his speech, the Turkish leader said predominantly Muslim Turkey had a long history of coexistence among diverse communities, stating that mosques, churches and synagogues stand side by side in various cities. Since coming to power in 2002, his government had completed the restoration of nearly 100 churches, monasteries, and other places of worship, Erdogan said.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the Palestinian issue is central to achieving peace in the region and praised the Vatican's stance on it. 

“At the heart of a lasting peace in our region lies the Palestinian issue,” Erdogan said in an address to Pope Leo XIV and members of the diplomatic corps in the Turkish capital, Ankara.

“I want it to be known that we have always appreciated the steadfast stance of our distinguished guest and his predecessors, especially regarding the Palestinian issue,” he said. 

The Turkish leader again criticized the killings of civilians in Gaza, and noted that one of the places of worship struck by Israel was a Catholic church. “I once again extend my condolences to them on this occasion,” Erdogan said.

He reiterated his call for a two-state solution to the Palestinian issue and said immediate steps must be taken to strengthen the Gaza ceasefire, protect civilians and ensure the uninterrupted delivery of humanitarian aid.

Pope Leo XIV warned on Thursday that the world is moving toward a heightened level of conflict, driven by economic and military power, and called on humanity to resist it.

Leo stressed that the energy and resources consumed by war should be directed toward the real challenges facing humanity: building peace, fighting hunger and poverty, improving health and education, and the “protection of creation.”

“We are now experiencing a phase marked by a heightened level of conflict on the global level, fueled by prevailing strategies of economic and military power” Leo said. “This is enabling what Pope Francis called ‘a third world war fought piecemeal.' We must in no way give in to this!”

He was addressing members of the diplomatic corps in the Turkish capital Ankara, after holding talks Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

In his address in the Turkish capital, Leo recalled that four popes had visited Turkey: Paul VI in 1967, John Paul II in 1979, Benedict XVI in 2006, and Francis in 2014.

“The visits by four popes ... show that the Holy See not only maintains good relations with (Turkey) but also desires to cooperate in building a better world with the contribution of this country,” he said.

Leo also pointed to the historical significance of Turkey as the site of the early ecumenical councils, including the Council of Nicaea.

On Friday, Leo will join Istanbul-based Greek Orthodox Patriarch Bartholomew to commemorate the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, which took place in today's Iznik, some 90 kilometers (54 miles) southeast of Istanbul.

The American pope emphasized a message of peace in a speech alongside President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Speaking to Erdogan and the country's diplomatic corps at a library in the palace complex, Leo praised Turkey's historic role as a bridge between East and West and the crossroads of religions and cultures.

“May Turkey be a source of stability and rapprochement between peoples, in services of a just and lasting peace,” he said, speaking in front of a giant globe. “Today, more than ever, we need people who will promote dialogue and practice it with firm will and patient resolve.”

Pope Leo XIV said Turkey's tiny Christian minority sees itself as part of the country's identity and wants to contribute positively to its unity.

In an address in Ankara following talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Leo spoke of the example of Saint John XXIII, known as the “Turkish pope.” 

Leo said Saint John XXIII had worked to ensure Catholics were included in the development of modern Turkey and rejected the idea that religious groups should isolate themselves within their own communities.

Pope Leo XIV says the Vatican has chosen the Dardanelles Bridge — a large suspension bridge connecting Europe to Asia — as the logo for his visit and a metaphor highlighting Turkey's role in connecting not only continents and cultures and its own diverse communities.

In a speech in the capital, Ankara, Leo said Turkey's strength lies in its internal diversity, which makes it a “crossroads of sensibilities.”

“You have an important place in both the present and future of the Mediterranean, and of the whole world, above all by valuing your internal diversity. Even before linking Asia with Europe, and East with West, this bridge connects Türkiye to itself,” Leo said, using the Turkish government's preferred spelling for the country.

He later used the metaphor of the bridge to explain how God's revelation creates a connection between heaven and earth. “The image of your great bridge is also helpful in this sense, for God, in revealing himself, established a bridge between heaven and earth. He did so in order that our hearts might change, becoming like his.”

Ankara residents on Thursday expressed their appreciation of Pope Leo XIV's decision to pay his respects at the mausoleum of modern Turkey's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.

Nilgun Altinsoy described it as significant, saying some leaders opposed to Ataturk's secular reforms — introduced following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire — refrain from paying their respects.“I congratulate the pope for this reason,” she said.

Bayram Alibastanbel said the pope's visit resonates with Ataturk's message of peace, which he said was relevant in the current climate of conflict. 

“Ataturk is a world-renowned leader who said ‘Peace at home, peace in the world,'” Alibastanbel said. “We are already going through a difficult time globally, a period with wars. Since this is a time when the world needs peace, I think this is a meaningful visit.”

Leo's Mercedes limousine received a horse-mounted escort to the presidential palace, where he was greeted by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

As is traditional for official guests to the palace, Leo paused in front of a guard of honor and addressed them with the words “Merhaba asker,” or “Greetings soldiers.”

He was then welcomed by officials and senior church members.

Leaving a message in the Book of Honor at the mausoleum, Leo wrote: “I give thanks to God for being able to visit Türkiye (Turkey), and I invoke upon this country and its people an abundance of peace and prosperity.”

Shopkeeper Ekim Erdogan, 47, said Leo's visit will have practical benefits for ordinary people, especially businesses like his. “There will be some employment; everyone will earn something for themselves. So yes, the pope's visit is good, of course, whoever contributes to this country, whoever it may be, it's good for shopkeepers.” 

Fatma Cicek Geyik, a 57-year-old artist, said the visit should not be exaggerated. She said Turkey is a land with a powerful history and she didn't see the need to “elevate” others' presence.

“He's welcome, his visit will bring joy. But I don't see it as something to exaggerate too much,” she said. “They will leave just as they came.” 

Leo is scheduled to leave for Istanbul later on Thursday following his meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the capital, Ankara.

Pope Leo XIV has arrived at the mausoleum of modern Turkey's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.

Leo strolled along a path lined with statues of lions — the Lion Path — behind a military detachment carrying a red-and-while floral tribute bearing his papal title.

He later laid the floral arrangement bearing the colors of the Turkish flag in front of the marble grave with the help of two honor guards and observed a minute a silence.

Pope Leo XIV was welcomed on the tarmac of Ankara's Esenboga Airport by a military guard of honor. 

Strolling along a turquoise carpet, he shook hands with Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy, other officials and senior church figures from Turkey. He was later scheduled to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and address members of the diplomatic corps in Ankara.

Despite an early wakeup, Pope Leo XIV said he had already done his Wordle online game before embarking on his first foreign trip.

Leo said he got Thursday's word in three tries.

Leo revealed last week that he opts for the challenging strategy in the popular New York Times puzzle of changing his start word each day. 

Leo revealed his Thursday score when he came to the back of the papal plane to greet journalists. Soon after he was elected in May, the pope's brother John Prevost revealed that the brothers play Wordle each day and compare scores, as many friends and family do.

Leo spoke to reporters Thursday as he traveled to Turkey on the first leg of a six-day trip that will also bring him to Lebanon.

Leo said he knows the visit to commemorate a key ecumenical anniversary was important for Christians. But he said he hoped his broader message of peace would resonate worldwide.

“We hope to also announce, transmit and proclaim how important peace is throughout the world. And to invite all people to come together to search for greater unity, greater harmony, and to look for the ways that all men and women can truly be brothers and sisters inspite of differences, inspite of different religions, inspite of different beliefs.”

The doyenne of the Vatican press corps, Mexican correspondent Valentina Alazraki, welcomed Leo aboard the ITA charter and presented him with a religious icon.

She reminded Leo that when Pope Francis first encountered reporters on his maiden voyage, in 2013 to Rio de Janeiro, she assured him that he needn't be afraid of reporters. It was a reference to Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio's well-known reluctance to engage with the Argentine media while he was archbishop of Buenos Aires.

Francis went on to enjoy a lively relationship with the press during his 12-year papacy, especially during his foreign trips, something Alazraki said the Vatican press corps hoped for with Leo.

Leo has engaged now on a weekly basis with a gaggle of press who gather each Tuesday evening outside the papal vacation retreat in Castel Gandolfo, where he goes on his days off.

“At Castel Gandolfo, you have already broken the ice,” Alazraki said, assuring Leo that the media can be useful to him and the Vatican to relay news of the papacy to the world.

Leo offered a word of thanks at the start of the flight when he came to the back of the papal plane to greet the estimated 80 journalists who are travelling with the Vatican delegation.

“To the Americans here, Happy Thanksgiving!” he said. “It's a wonderful day to celebrate.”

History's first American pope thanked the journalists for their work, saying it was important today to transmit information “that really reveals the truth and the harmony that the world needs.”

At least two journalists presented Leo with pumpkin pies. He was also gifted a baseball bat once owned by legendary White Sox player Nellie Fox, and a pair of White Sox-branded slippers and socks.

The latter gift was a reference to Leo's quip last week that he only wears white socks, a play on words about his beloved Chicago baseball team.

Pope Leo XIV has landed in Ankara to kick off a trip to Turkey and Lebanon until Tuesday.

There has been a surge of renewed optimism over the possible reopening of a Greek Orthodox religious seminary that has been closed since 1971.

The Halki Theological School has become a symbol of Orthodox heritage and a focal point in the push for religious freedoms in Turkey.

Located on Heybeliada Island, off the coast of Istanbul, the seminary once trained generations of Greek Orthodox patriarchs and clergy. They include Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader of some 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide.

Turkey closed the school under laws restricting private higher education, and despite repeated appeals from international religious leaders and human rights advocates — as well as subsequent legal changes that allowed private universities to flourish — it has remained shut ever since.

Momentum for reopening it appeared to grow after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed the issue with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in September. Erdogan said Turkey would “do our part” regarding its reopening. Erdogan had previously linked the move to reciprocal measures from Greece to improve the rights of Muslims there.

The fourth visit of a pope to Lebanon sends a powerful message of support at a time when regional instability and deepening internal crises have left the country in a precarious situation.

Since 2019, Lebanon has been battered by political unrest, the collapse of its currency and banking system, the port explosion and, most recently, a war between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group. The war decimated large swaths of southern and eastern Lebanon, leaving more than 4,000 dead, including hundreds of civilians, and causing an estimated $11 billion worth of destruction.

To many Lebanese, it feels like divine intervention is the only solution for their country.

The highlight of the Lebanese visit will come on Leo's last day, Dec. 2, when he spends time in silent prayer at the site of the Aug. 4, 2020, Beirut port blast.

The explosion tore through the Lebanese capital, killing at least 218 people, wounding more than 6,000 and devastating large swaths of Beirut.

Lebanese citizens were enraged by the blast, which appeared to be the result of government negligence, coming on top of an economic crisis spurred by decades of corruption and financial crimes. But an investigation has repeatedly stalled, and five years on, no official has been convicted.

Another important moment will come when Leo meets with young Lebanese. He is expected to give them words of encouragement, amid the decades-long flight of Lebanese abroad, while also acknowledging their disillusionment over the failures of generations before them.

Leo will visit the Blue Mosque in Istanbul and preside over an interfaith meeting in both Istanbul and in Beirut. Significantly, he will not visit the landmark Hagia Sophia monument in Istanbul as previous popes have done.

In July 2020, Turkey converted Hagia Sophia — once one of the most important historic cathedrals in Christianity and a United Nations-designated world heritage site — from a museum back into a mosque, a move that drew widespread international criticism. At the time, Francis said he was “deeply pained” by the decision.

Clergy in the region say the Vatican's strong support for Palestinians in Gaza during the Israel-Hamas war, first under Francis and now Leo, has bolstered the church's credibility among Muslims.

Security, though, is expected to be tight, as the regional conflicts have not abated. Israel fired an airstrike on Lebanon's capital on Sunday that killed Hezbollah's chief of staff and four others.

Leo said this week such attacks were “always a concern,” but he appealed for all to pursue dialogue, not violence.

Pope Leo XIV is heading to Turkey on Thursday on his first foreign trip, fulfilling the late Pope Francis' plans to mark an important Orthodox anniversary and bring a message of peace to the region at a crucial time for efforts to end the war in Ukraine and ease Mideast tensions.

The main impetus for Leo to travel to Turkey is to mark the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, Christianity's first ecumenical council.

Leo will pray with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, at the site of the 325 AD gathering, today's Iznik in northwestern Turkey, and sign a joint declaration in a visible sign of Christian unity.

Eastern and Western churches were united until the Great Schism of 1054, a divide precipitated largely by disagreements over the primacy of the pope.

While the visit is timed for the important Catholic-Orthodox anniversary, it will also allow Leo to reinforce the church's relations with Muslims. Leo is due to visit the Blue Mosque and preside over an interfaith meeting in Istanbul.

            Near the back corner of the local library's parking lot, largely out of view from the main road, the South Carolina Department of Public Health opened a pop-up clinic in early November, offering free measles vaccines to adults and children.
    


            Spartanburg County, in South Carolina's Upstate region, has been fighting a measles outbreak since early October, with more than 50 cases identified. Health officials have encouraged people who are unvaccinated to get a shot by visiting its mobile vaccine clinic at any of its several stops throughout the county.
    


            But on a Monday afternoon in Boiling Springs, only one person showed up.
    


            “It's progress. That progress is slow,” Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist with the Department of Public Health, said during a recent press briefing. “We had hoped to see a more robust uptake than that in our mobile health units.”
    


            As South Carolina tries to contain its measles outbreak, public health officials across the nation are concerned that the highly contagious virus is making a major comeback. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied more than 1,700 measles cases and 45 outbreaks in 2025. The largest started in Texas, where hundreds of people were infected and two children died.
    


            For the first time in more than two decades, the United States is poised to lose its measles elimination status, a designation indicating that outbreaks are rare and rapidly contained.
    


            South Carolina's measles outbreak isn't yet as large as those in other states, such as New Mexico, Arizona, and Kansas. But it shows how a confluence of larger national trends — including historically low vaccination rates, skepticism fueled by the pandemic, misinformation, and “health freedom” ideologies proliferated by conservative politicians — have put some communities at risk for the reemergence of a preventable, potentially deadly virus.
    


            “Everyone talks about it being the canary in the coal mine because it's the most contagious infectious disease out there,” said Josh Michaud, associate director for global and public health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. “The logic is indisputable that we're likely to see more outbreaks.”
    


            Spartanburg's vaccination rate is among the lowest of South Carolina's 46 counties. And that was true “even before covid,” said Chris Lombardozzi, a senior vice president with the Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System.
    


            Nearly 6,000 children in Spartanburg County schools last year — 10% of the total enrollment — either received an exemption allowing them to forgo required vaccinations or did not meet vaccine requirements, according to data published by the state.
    


            Lombardozzi said the county's low vaccination rate is tied to misinformation not only published on social media but also spread by “a variety of nonmedical leaders over the years.”
    


            The pandemic made things worse. Michaud said that fear and misinformation surrounding covid vaccines “threw gasoline on the fire of people's vaccine skepticism.” In some cases, that skepticism transferred to childhood vaccines, which historically have been less controversial, he said.
    


            This made communities like Spartanburg County with low vaccination rates more vulnerable. “Which is why we're seeing constant, small brush fires of measles outbreaks,” Michaud said.
    


Acting CDC director, citing Trump directive, calls for MMR shot to be split into three despite no evidence of benefit



            In Spartanburg, the overall percentage of students with required immunizations fell from 95.1% to 90% between the 2020-21 and 2024-25 academic years. Public health officials say a minimum of 95% is required to prevent significant spread of measles.
    


            Children who attend public and private schools in South Carolina are required to show that they've received some vaccinations, including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, but religious exemptions are relatively easy to obtain. The exemption form must be notarized, but it does not require a doctor's note or any disclosure about the family's religious beliefs.
    


            The number of students in South Carolina who have been granted religious exemptions has increased dramatically over the past decade. That's particularly true in the Upstate region, where religious exemptions have increased sixfold from a decade ago. During the 2013-14 school year, 2,044 students in the Upstate were granted a religious exemption to the vaccine requirements, according to data published by The Post and Courier. By fall 2024, that number had jumped to more than 13,000.
    


            Some schools are more exposed than others. The beginning of the South Carolina outbreak was largely linked to one public charter school, Global Academy of South Carolina, where only 17% of the 605 students enrolled during the 2024-25 school year provided documentation showing they had received their required vaccinations, according to data published by the Department of Public Health.
    


            No one from Global Academy responded to interview requests.
    


            In April, after visiting a Texas family whose daughter had died from measles, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote on social media that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” He made a similar statement during an interview on “Dr. Phil” later that month.
    


            But these endorsements stand at odds with other statements Kennedy has made that cast doubt on vaccine safety and have falsely linked vaccines with autism. The CDC, under his authority, now claims such links “have been ignored by health authorities.”
    


            “What would I do if I could go back in time and I could avoid giving my children the vaccines that I gave them?” he said on a podcast in 2020. “I would do anything for that. I would pay anything to be able to do that.”
    


            Throughout 2025, he has made other misleading or unsupported statements. During a congressional hearing in September, Kennedy defended his past claims that he was not anti-vaccine but affirmed his stated position that no vaccines are safe or effective.
    


            Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, told KFF Health News that Kennedy is “pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability.” Hilliard said HHS is working with “state and local partners in South Carolina” and in other states to provide support during the measles outbreaks.
    


            Meanwhile, Kennedy has frequently championed the idea of health freedom, or freedom of choice, regarding vaccines, a talking point that has taken root among Republicans.
    


            That has had a “chilling effect all the way down through state and local lawmakers,” Michaud said, making some leaders hesitant to talk about the threat that the ongoing measles outbreaks poses or the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccine.
    


Canada loses its measles elimination status amid large outbreak



            Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, said the governor was not available to be interviewed for this article but referenced McMaster's comment from October that measles “is a dangerous disease, but in terms of diseases, it's not one that we should panic about.”
    


            On a separate occasion that month, the Republican governor said he does not support vaccine mandates. “We're not going to have mandates,” he said, “and I think we are responding properly.”
    


            Even though the South Carolina Department of Public Health has repeatedly encouraged measles vaccines, the push has been notably quieter than the agency's covid vaccine outreach efforts.
    


            In 2021, for example, the agency partnered with breweries throughout the state for a campaign called “Shot and a Chaser,” which rewarded people who got a covid vaccine with a free beer or soda. By contrast, the pop-up measles vaccine clinic at the Boiling Springs Library featured no flashy signage, no freebies, and wasn't visible from the library's main entrance.
    


            Edward Simmer, interim director of the Department of Public Health, would not speak to KFF Health News about the measles outbreak. During a legislative hearing in April, Republican state lawmakers voted against his permanent confirmation because of his past support for covid vaccines and masking. One lawmaker specifically criticized the agency during that hearing for the Shot and a Chaser campaign.
    


            Public health officials in other states also have been blocked from new roles because of their covid response. In Missouri, where MMR vaccine rates have declined among kindergartners since 2020 and measles cases have been reported this year, Republican lawmakers rejected a public health director in 2022 after vaccine opponents protested his appointment.
    


            In South Carolina, Simmer, lacking lawmakers' confirmation, leads the public health agency in an interim capacity.
    


            South Carolina Sen. Tom Davis of Beaufort was the only Republican on the Senate Medical Affairs Committee who voted to confirm Simmer in April. He told KFF Health News that his Republican colleagues raised valid questions about Simmer's past support for covid vaccines.
    


            But, Davis said, it would be “tremendously unfortunate and not beneficial from a public health perspective” if the Republican Party just took a stance against vaccines “as a matter of policy.”
    


            The Department of Public Health had administered 44 doses of the MMR vaccine through its mobile health unit from October to mid-November. The last mobile vaccine clinic was scheduled for Nov. 24. But health officials are encouraged that patients are seeking vaccines elsewhere. The agency's tracking system shows that providers across Spartanburg County administered more than twice as many measles vaccines in October as they did a year ago.
    


            As of mid-November, more than 130 people remained in quarantine, most of them students at local elementary and middle schools. Cases have also been linked to a church and Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport.
    


            “We're reminding people that travel for the upcoming holidays increases the risk of exposures greatly,” said Bell, the state epidemiologist. “Due to that risk, we're encouraging people to consider getting vaccinated now.”

California's $12 billion budget deficit is not stopping state lawmakers from sending hundreds of millions for pet projects to their home districts this year, a decision that could shape the fate of at least two Democrats seeking higher elected office.

In all, Golden State lawmakers spent at least $415 million on local projects to help curry favor with constituents and win their next election. There were nearly 100 earmarks tucked into just one of the state's budget bills for local projects and programs that had little to no benefit for anyone outside of the specific lawmaker's district.

“Politicians across generations — and in every country — try to use some portion of the budget on these clear signals that they're directing the flow of government dollars to real people and real organizations right at home in their district,” said Thad Kousser, a former legislative staffer and political science professor at the University of California, San Diego. “Voters reward that.”

The pork spending this year went to general funds for museums, trails, and other amenities, some of which are in well-to-do communities. It also raised concerns about legislative priorities in a year where Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) has spoken repeatedly about tightening pursestrings due to funding cuts and the threat of funding cuts from the Trump administration.

The earmarks arrived as Newsom and state lawmakers left key state jobs vacant, backed away from their universal healthcare pledges, controversially plugged budget holes with costly high-interest borrowing, and tapped billions from California's “rainy day” reserve, CalMatters reported.

Lawmakers redirected $250 million from Proposition 4, a $10 billion climate bond approved in 2024 to fund projects related to the Safe Drinking Water, Wildfire Prevention, Drought Preparedness, and Clean Air Bond Act. The funds were instead channeled toward district-specific projects, prompting concerns over misuse of voter-backed funds.

After losing his legislative leadership seat earlier this year, Democratic state Sen. Mike McGuire, who is running for Congress next year, hauled in among the most funds of any state legislator.

McGuire's district, which stretches from the San Francisco Bay to the Oregon border and includes parts of Sonoma, Marin, Mendocino, Lake, Humboldt, Trinity, and Del Norte counties, was the recipient of more than two dozen earmarks totaling more than $100 million. That's about a quarter of the earmark funds for the state. Money went to fund everything from harbors to habitat projects and a $250,000 farm-animal rescue.

McGuire, who will be running for Rep. Doug LaMalfa's (R-CA) First Congressional District, secured $50 million for a redwood trail that cuts through his district.

McGuire told KRCB that his accomplishments in the state Senate have given him the credibility to become an effective member of Congress: “We've delivered $3 billion for the North Coast and the North Bay, rebuilding and modernizing schools, investing record funding for our kids, passing the largest affordability package in our state's history, [and] making life more affordable for every Californian.”

Another Democratic lawmaker funneling millions to his district is state Sen. Scott Wiener, who recently announced his candidacy for Rep. Nancy Pelosi's (D-CA) House seat. Wiener, who chairs the state's powerful Senate Budget Committee, secured $9 million in general fund earmarks that will directly help San Franciscans, many of whom will decide his congressional fate.

The money will go toward parks, restroom improvements, and to “support the preservation and revitalization of a historic LGBTQ+ venue” in the city's Castro area. The Castro is known as one of the most prominent symbols of LGBT activism in the world.

San Francisco will also get $1 million for a new clinic for the Chinese Hospital and $250,000 for improvements to the Wah Mei child development center, according to CalMatters.

Some other big-dollar projects across the state included $20 million to help the public access a Santa Barbara County beach gated off by rich celebrities, a cattle operation, and 8 miles of undeveloped Pacific Ocean shoreline, as well as $15 million for “geological heritage sites” including the La Brea Tar Pits, which has been used to study climate change.

Longtime NBA veteran Kevin Love talks to Fox News Digital about the "stain" of gambling in professional sports and his hopes for a resolution.

Odds are that most Thanksgiving dinners will include a heaping helping of Packers-Lions. A side of Chiefs-Cowboys. A run back out to the fridge for a plate of stuffing alongside the nightcap game of Bengals-Ravens. A veritable football smorgasbord paired with mashed potatoes, green bean casserole and a slab of pumpkin pie.

But the real side dish to go with the games may be your wagers. Drop the dark meat. Put your money where your mouth is.

More and more Americans are placing wagers on practically anything related to sports. You can take the over-under on individual games or see if the Lions cover the point spread. But many fans are now lured by very specific bets. You can wager money on how many passing attempts Lamar Jackson has or how many penalties the Lions will commit. Maybe bet how many times they'll show Taylor Swift on the screen during the Chiefs contest. The American Gaming Association says sportsbooks scored a staggering $13.71 billion in revenue last year. Heightened gambling interest is what worries lawmakers.

Astonishing betting scandals recently rocked the NBA and Major League Baseball.

Portland Trail Blazers head coach and Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups pleaded not guilty earlier this week to charges of taking part in an illegal poker scheme with possible ties to organized crime.

Terry Rozier of the Miami Heat is due for arraignment on Dec. 8. Prosecutors accuse Rozier of yanking himself out of a game two years ago because of a foot injury. But bettors placed hundreds of thousands of dollars in wagers on how many points Rozier might score, as well as rebounds and assists. The feds allege that Rozier benched himself to help a gambling ring that bet on the paucity of his performance that night.

And the feds busted Cleveland Guardians pitchers Luis Ortiz and Emmanuel Clase for allegedly conspiring with bettors to throw specific pitches at specific times during the games. It's believed this resulted in bettors pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars.

So there's the gaming of the games.

That's why lawmakers question whether fans can trust what they see on the field or the court.

"People have to have faith in the product, and they have to have the belief that the players are playing, and the coaches are on the up and up and the refs are on the up and up," said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo.

"You may not be able to throw a strike 10% of the time. But even a lousy pitcher as I am could throw a ball 100% of the time," said Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Cruz, R-Texas. "These cheating scandals threaten to undermine the integrity of sports."

That's why Cruz and the top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Maria Cantwell, of Washington state, wrote to Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred. They want answers on suspicious wagers and whether there are any other instances of alleged rigging. Cruz and Cantwell fired off a letter to the NBA as well.

"We need these organizations to make sure that there's rules and regulations in place that are followed," said Cantwell. "What you should do to make sure that people are complying."

"If you're watching a game and you think, ‘Is this the glorious uncertainty of sport, or is this some theater designed by gambling mobsters and their addicted athletes?' then the joy of sport is dead, ladies and gentlemen," said University of New Haven professor Declan Hill after a meeting with lawmakers.

The latest line is on the emerging phenomenon of prop bets. People don't wager on overall outcomes of games or who might win the division or conference, but instead place their money on individual events during the game.

"We are a long way from the Black Sox scandal," said John Affleck, Knight Chair in Sports Journalism and Society at Penn State.

That's where eight members of the Chicago White Sox allegedly took money to throw the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds – although the evidence of what the White Sox players may have done is mixed at best.

"We're now in a place where the first corner kick or the number of points you score in the first half can be manipulated if you have a willing athlete," said Affleck.

Sports leagues have all cozied up to commercial gambling operations over the past few years. Many established partnerships. Some lawmakers believe betting scandals were inevitable once the leagues and the gaming industry parlayed their fortunes together.

"These growing scandals simply highlight the need for national standards that stop the sports betting industry from exploiting vulnerable gamblers and the potential corruption among the players themselves," said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. "The sports betting industry has grown huge without any kind of safeguards against the use of algorithms and micro bets to target individuals, whether they are gamblers or players in sports."

Congress hasn't passed a gambling law since 2006.

Lawmakers say the leagues should tread carefully with gambling. Fans could lose interest if they think the sports are rigged.

"All these scandals," said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. "People are going to get tired of it and move on. I mean, my God, football, basketball, baseball should all be worried now that watching people play video games is a spectator sport."

And we reside in a period when people routinely take to social media to claim that the leagues only want certain teams to succeed or that the refs or umpires are biased against their club.

"I think of the proclivity of conspiracy theories in our modern world. It just sort of fits that as soon as you get a bad call as a fan, you go ‘Fix!,'" said Affleck. "That's what the leagues have to be worried about — a sense that everybody's on the take."

There are also worries about how gaming apps are designed to lure people.

"It's impossible to ignore the similarities between sportsbooks today and the big tobacco efforts of decades earlier," said Rep. Paul Tonko, D-N.Y. "Instead of ads with doctors recommending cigarettes, it's celebrities teaching viewers how to bet."

Tonko said one in five Americans bet on sports at least once a month and 7 million people have a gambling problem. He added that one in five of those addicted to gambling will attempt suicide.

"In short, we are dealing with a massive and growing public health crisis involving a known addictive product," said Tonko.

Affleck believes gaming apps have "a particular appeal to younger bettors, which raises some alarm bells about early addiction."

So Congress is investigating, but it's unclear if anything will come of the inquiry into the recent pro-betting scandals.

"I think there's a risk of Congress overstepping," said Eric Schmitt, arguing that regulation of gaming should be left to the states.

So will much come of the congressional probe? Will we see gaming legislation from lawmakers?

Considering the current dysfunction of Congress, don't bet on it.

The suspected shooter of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday is a native of Afghanistan who previously worked in the United States for multiple government agencies, one of which was the Central Intelligence Agency.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the suspected shooter, entered the U.S. in 2021 as part of the initiative of the Joe Biden presidential administration known as “Operation Allies Welcome.” Fox News reported that he was a member of a partner force in Kandahar, Afghanistan and worked for U.S. government agencies, one of which was the CIA. 

CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed Lakanwal's previous association with the CIA and other U.S. government agencies in an interview with Fox News.

“In the wake of the disastrous Biden withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Biden administration justified bringing the alleged shooter to the United States in September 2021 due to his prior work with the U.S. government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar, which ended shortly following the chaotic evacuation,” said Ratcliffe.

​​”The individual — and so many others — should have never been allowed to come here,” added Ratcliffe. “Our citizens and service members deserve far better than to endure the ongoing fallout from the Biden administration's catastrophic failures.” 

As the Washington Examiner previously reported, Lakanwal is accused of shooting two West Virginia National Guard members near the Farragut West Metro station, located in close proximity to the White House. Both victims were reportedly in critical condition and being treated at nearby hospitals. 

President Donald Trump posted about the shooting on his Truth Social account on Wednesday afternoon. 

“The animal that shot the two National Guardsmen, with both being critically wounded, and now in two separate hospitals, is also severely wounded, but regardless, will pay a very steep price,” said Trump. “God bless our Great National Guard, and all of our Military and Law Enforcement. These are truly Great People. I, as President of the United States, and everyone associated with the Office of the Presidency, am with you!”

TWO NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS CRITICALLY INJURED IN SHOOTING NEAR WHITE HOUSE

Previously, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced that both victims had died as a result of their injuries from the shooting. However, he later issued a retraction and clarification, saying that he had received “conflicting reports.”

As of Thursday morning, there were conflicting reports about their survival.

            It took only a few hours for President Donald Trump to turn what he called “an act of evil, and an act of terror” into a full-blown argument for an even more intense crackdown on immigration.
    


            His vow came as authorities held a man Trump described as an Afghan national over the shooting of two West Virginia National Guard reservists in Washington, DC. They were in the capital as part of Trump's controversial deployment of troops to bolster law enforcement.
    


             “America will never bend and never yield in the face of terror, and at the same time, we will not be deterred from the mission these service members were so nobly fulfilling,” Trump said.
    


            The president, speaking on video from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, pivoted quickly from paying tribute to the victims of the tragedy to blaming the Biden administration for bringing the alleged shooter to the United States after the withdrawal of American troops in 2021. He claimed the incident “underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation.”
    


            But he also used the moment to drive home his campaign against other migrants in politically charged remarks that went far beyond Afghanistan — at a moment when his administration is moving to reinterview some refugees admitted under President Joe Biden and revoking temporary protected status for those from several dangerous world hot spots.
    


            Trump lashed out at Somali immigrants in Minnesota, despite there being no apparent connection with the DC shooting. He claimed they were “ripping off our country and ripping apart that once-great state.” Trump described Somalia as a country that has “no laws, no water, no military, no nothing.”
    


            The full details of the incident in Washington are not yet known. But Trump's comments were characteristic of a president who rarely waits for full clarity before engaging politically.
    


            But there will certainly be urgent questions about the vetting of Afghan immigrants — many of whom came to the US during the Biden administration after helping American forces during the country's longest war. While the exact circumstances of Wednesday's incident are not fully known, the FBI has long warned about the danger of self-radicalized individuals from immigrant communities becoming inspired by groups such as ISIS or online propaganda and carrying out attacks on the US homeland.
    


            Scrutiny may also fall on any follow-up immigration proceedings for the suspect that stretched into Trump's second term. Then there's the question of whether there were intelligence failures by Trump's team ahead of Wednesday's attack, at a time when government agencies are accused by critics of diverting resources from national security to immigration enforcement.
    


            Politically, Trump seemed to be keen to define the debate that is sure to unfold over the shootings.
    


            He vowed to “reexamine every single alien” who came to the US from Afghanistan, in remarks that will likely create fear among law-abiding immigrants — many of whom helped the US military and diplomats at considerable risk to themselves and their families during America's longest war.
    


            The president's senior White House adviser Stephen Miller said on Fox News after the attack that Trump had made a “historic announcement, a brave announcement.”
    


            “What you heard tonight from President Trump, the breaking news here tonight, is saying that his government is going to accelerate efforts to review every person added this country over the last four years,” Miller said.
    


            “Now obviously, if you are illegal you are out automatically,” Miller continued. “But everybody else who was brought here, refugee, asylum status, whatever status … if you're not someone who loves this country, if you're not any benefit to this country, then we're going to send you out of this country.”
    


            Trump's extremely political remarks may also have been designed to shut down any suggestions that the National Guard soldiers patrolling Washington in their fatigues have been left vulnerable by an ill-defined mission.
    


            A political storm has raged around the National Guard since Trump ordered it into some US cities. Now, debate will sharpen over the guard's role and the administration's attempts to militarize law enforcement in what officials described as a “targeted shooting” on the eve of Thanksgiving.
    


            The shootings in Washington, DC, were the latest shocking outburst of public violence in a wrenching year that saw the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and killing of a state lawmaker and her husband in Minnesota.
    


            Wednesday's tragedy took on extra poignancy as Americans gathered with their families ahead of the national holiday, and cut deep for the people of West Virginia, which is among several states to send volunteer reservists to DC.
    


            For National Guard troops on the streets of the capital Wednesday night, the shootings raised immediate and traumatic questions over their safety and protection, as their comrades lay in critical condition in the hospital. National Guard troops sent to Washington have been notable for their good humor and professionalism. But suddenly the possible danger that comes with their mission has come into sharp focus.
    


            More broadly, and once the motive of the assailant has been established, there will be scrutiny about the unusual nature of the mission that the troops are being asked to undertake, in peacetime, on domestic soil. In their military fatigues, National Guard troops are highly visible — as seems to be Trump's intent for deterrence purposes — but that can also leave them exposed.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security has identified the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal. Officials briefed on the investigation said that they believe the shooter's initial identification matches a man from Washington state who appears to have immigrated to the US from Afghanistan in August 2021. That theory will raise counter-terrorism concerns over whether the alleged shooter had a motivation to target US soldiers directly and whether other attacks are possible. US forces left Afghanistan for the last time in a chaotic withdrawal in August 2021.
    


            The administration responded swiftly to the horror by doubling down on the deployment. Trump asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to mobilize 500 additional National Guard service members to the capital. The administration had also filed an emergency court order seeking to keep guard troops in the city after a federal judge last week ordered their removal, pending appeal.
    


            The National Guard's initial deployment to Washington was hugely controversial and is part of a wider strategy that has seen reservists sent to other cities, including Los Angeles. Trump, who cultivates a strongman image, has long appeared keen to deploy troops on domestic soil, despite laws limiting their use in law enforcement missions. He called the guard to Washington in August while placing the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control and mobilizing officers from other agencies, arguing the city was a “filthy and crime ridden embarrassment” despite official data showing that crime was falling.
    


            But critics warned that deploying troops was unnecessary and carried authoritarian overtones. Washington, DC, officials sued the administration, arguing that it had violated the city's limited home rule and the authority of Congress, while flouting laws that prohibit the use of the military in domestic law enforcement in all but the most extreme circumstances. “The deployment also risks inflaming tensions and fueling distrust toward local law enforcement,” the lawsuit said.
    


            That debate was already being revisited following Wednesday's shooting, with a White House official forcefully rebutting criticism over the necessity of the guard's presence in DC as an attempt to “politicize this tragedy.”
    


            Police and the FBI were searching for a motive for the attack. City Mayor Muriel Bowser said that the guards were victims of a “targeted shooting.” With that in mind, the investigation will be important to establishing whether this was a politicized attack or whether the guard members were a target of opportunity — factors that are likely to shape how the politics of the incident's aftermath develop.
    


            Neither possibility will lessen the heinous nature of the shooting or detract from the tragedy of two volunteer reservists being shot while serving their country.
    


            Trump has argued that his Washington, DC, crackdown is a huge success, and that people now feel safe in the capital. It's unclear how the Thanksgiving shooting, which sent scores of people running from the scene, will influence perceptions of his strategy.
    


            Critics of Trump's approach have long worried that, far from making DC safer, the presence of uniformed troops on the streets could cause more tensions and that the soldiers could themselves be vulnerable. After the initial shock of seeing khaki-clad troops on the streets and vehicles in military livery, many Washingtonians have come to see Guard members as a largely benign presence. They are often seen milling outside Metro stations and even picking up litter in “beautification” projects. They have typically not been in combat posture, even though some have been armed.
    


            But federal District Judge Jia Cobb wrote last week, in an order ruling that the Guard was illegally deployed in Washington, that there was a “substantial risk” that their presence “is going to lead to a dangerous or deadly encounter that could be catastrophic for public safety.”
    


            Cobb, however, delayed her order 21 days to allow the Trump administration to file an appeal.
    


            Now that troops have been the victims of an attack, Democrats are sure to question Trump's decision-making.
    


            California Rep. Robert Garcia told CNN's Jim Sciutto that the attack was “horrific” and said he was thinking about “the entire Guard family.” He added that he wasn't sure Trump's ask for 500 additional troops was “the right call” and that decisions about the security situations should be left to local officials.
    


            Democratic Rep. James Walkinshaw of Virginia told CNN's Erica Hill the shootings were “shocking and horrific.” He noted that many people in the DC region admired the professionalism of the guard and have had positive interactions with them.
    


            “Most of us in the Democratic side in Congress don't think we should have National Guard men and women in our cities. But if that is going to happen, and when that is going to happen, I think it is incumbent on the administration to lay out a clear plan to ensure their protection,” said Walkinshaw, who just joined the House Homeland Security Committee.
    


            Since officials are calling the shooting “targeted,” there will be questions over whether Guard troops have the necessary force protection measures and training to deal with risks they face on the streets. “You've put National Guardsman in a bad position, now you have got them serving as law enforcement … that's not what they were trained to do,” former Washington, DC, Police Chief Charles Ramsey told CNN.
    


            “You have got to really stop and think about what is it that are you trying to accomplish,” Ramsey said. “What is the mission?”
    


            Nebraska Republican Rep. Don Bacon told CNN that in such an escalated political climate, everyone should react temperately to the horrific incident in Washington. “It is very incumbent on all of us, Democrats and Republicans, in the news, that we treat each other decently, we can disagree without being over the top, angry, throwing gas, lighting things on fire right now — our society, this hyper-partisanship that we have.”
    


            Most leading politicians were taking Bacon's advice, issuing statements calling for prayers for the injured service members.
    


            But a tragedy like this is sure to have political implications.

President Donald Trump blamed his predecessor on Wednesday for letting the suspected gunman linked to the National Guard shooting in Washington, D.C., enter the United States four years ago.

The suspect has been identified as 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who reportedly arrived in the U.S. under the Biden administration's Operation Allies Welcome. The operation was established following the U.S. military's withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021.

Trump criticized former President Joe Biden for overseeing the post-Afghanistan immigration policy.

“He was flown in by the Biden administration in September 2021 on those infamous flights that everybody was talking about,” Trump said in a televised address from West Palm Beach, Florida. He was not present at the White House when the shooting occurred shortly after 2 p.m. on Wednesday.

“Nobody knew who was coming in. Nobody knew anything about it,” the president added. “His status was extended under legislation signed by President Biden, a disastrous president, the worst in the history of our country.”

Lakanwal overstayed his visa, which reportedly expired in September this year. His last address was recorded in Washington state.

Without naming the suspect, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed he was an Afghan national who took advantage of Biden's lax immigration policy.

“The suspect who shot our brave National Guardsmen is an Afghan national who was one of the many unvetted, mass paroled into the United States under Operation Allies Welcome on September 8, 2021, under the Biden Administration,” she wrote on X. “I will not utter this depraved individual's name. He should be starved of the glory he so desperately wants.”

In his speech, Trump said Wednesday's shooting “underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation,” addressing the Biden administration's admission of illegal immigrants.

He then cited Minnesota as an example of a state that has been too lenient in letting in foreigners, particularly Somali nationals.

“Gangs of Somalians come from a country that doesn't even have a government — no laws, no water, no military, no nothing — as their representatives in our country preach to us about our Constitution and how our country is no good,” he said, seemingly referencing Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who was born in Somalia.

Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the U.S., with estimates as high as 80,000 people.

Trump went on to say the U.S. won't tolerate assaults on law enforcement by illegal immigrants.

“We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country,” he continued. “If they can't love our country, we don't want them.”

Following Trump's lead, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services halted all immigration requests coming from Afghanistan.

“Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” the agency said in a statement. “The protections and safety of our homeland and of the American people remains our singular focus and mission.”

SUSPECTED GUNMAN IN DC NATIONAL GUARD SHOOTING IDENTIFIED AS AFGHAN NATIONAL

Hours earlier, the suspected gunman fired shots at two West Virginia National Guard members with a handgun near the White House. The wounded suspect was swiftly apprehended, and the two troops remain in critical condition as they receive medical treatment at a local hospital.

The motive for the attack remains unclear, but officials have described the incident as a “targeted shooting” aimed at the National Guard. Steven Nordhaus, the chief of the National Guard Bureau, is traveling from Guantanamo Bay to Washington, D.C., to be present with troops in the aftermath of the shooting.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Jefferies' relationship into bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands Group, The Financial Times reported Thursday. 

The newspaper, citing people with knowledge of the matter, said the regulator is looking into whether Jefferies gave investors enough information on its Point Bonita fund's exposure to the failed auto business. 

The inquiry into internal controls and potential conflicts within the bank is at an early stage, the report said. It's not clear whether it will result in any allegations of wrongdoing. 

Jefferies came under pressure last month after its exposure to First Brands — which collapsed under a series of complex debt agreements — raised fears of other bad loans on Wall Street. 

Shares of Jefferies are down more than 12% this quarter and 27% this year. 

When asked for comment, an SEC spokesperson said the agency "does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation."

Jefferies did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Black Friday is the biggest shopping holiday of the year, and Disney Plus and Hulu are celebrating in style. The best Disney Plus and Hulu Black Friday deals in 2025 can help you save on some of the streaming service's most popular bundles.

The flashiest component of the Disney Plus and Hulu bundle deals is the ad-supported bundle. From now through Cyber Monday, new and eligible returning subscribers can get their first 12 months of service for just $4.99 a month. This is about 62% off the standard $12.99 a month price, making it one of the best Black Friday streaming deals of 2025.

There are a few other Disney Plus bundle deals that are can't-miss, including the ad-free Disney Plus and Hulu bundle, which discounts the bundle price down from $19.99 a month to $14.99 a month for 12 months. While the ad-free Black Friday deal is technically only 25% off, this is a stellar deal considering how rarely the bundle is on sale (and how pricey ad-free streaming services can get).


                      There's a huge double-saving on these two bundled popular ad-supported streaming platforms. The plan offers all content from both Hulu and Disney Plus at a fraction of what it would cost to pay for them separately.
                    


                      If you're planning to get Disney+ and Hulu ad-free, you'll find major savings by bundling the two together.
                    

If you're looking for something a little more sports-friendly, you might be interested in one of the Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Unlimited bundle deals. The ad-supported Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Unlimited deal typically costs $35.99 a month, but the current deal knocks it down to $29.99 a month for 12 months, which shakes out to 17% off.

The premium Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Unlimited (ad-free Disney Plus and Hulu, plus ESPN Unlimited, which features ad-supported live streams) usually costs $44.99 a month, but the deal brings it down to $38.99 a month (13% off) for 12 months. These special offers run until January, so customers have a little bit more time to cash in on them beyond Black Friday and Cyber Monday.


                      This bundle combines ad-supported Disney Plus and Hulu with ESPN Unlimited, pulling together three massive libraries for one discounted price.
                    


                      The Premium tier of this bundle combines ESPN Unlimited with ad-free Disney Plus and Hulu. This plan also unlocks the ability to download content.
                    

Keep reading to learn everything you need to know about the Disney Plus and Hulu deals, including specific end dates and eligibility requirements. For even more deals, check out all of our early Black Friday coverage across top categories.

The Black Friday Disney Plus and Hulu bundle deals will run through December 1, 2025. The offers end at 11:59 p.m. PST on Cyber Monday. As we mentioned above, the Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Unlimited bundle deals are expected to stick around until January 5, 2026.

The Disney Plus and Hulu Black Friday bundle deals are available to new and eligible returning subscribers. Current Disney Plus, ESPN, Hulu, and bundle subscribers are not eligible for the Disney Plus and Hulu bundle offers. If you got the Disney Plus Black Friday promotional deal last year, you'll be able to sign up for the deal again this year as long as your subscription ended before November 25, 2025, and has been fully canceled. The best way to confirm exactly what offers are available to you is to start the sign-up process.

There are several other bundles in addition to the four deals we've highlighted today, which you can read about in our Disney Plus bundles guide. There are ad-supported and ad-free Disney Plus, Hulu, and HBO Max bundles for those seeking the ultimate entertainment package. Additionally, there are bundles for Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Select, which are cheaper than the ESPN Unlimited bundles and offer a pared-down sports streaming experience.

While these bundles aren't a part of the limited-time Black Friday deals, we still think they're worth checking out. We already consider the Disney Plus bundles to be stellar offers (even without a special limited-time deal), since they offer such significant savings each month compared to subscribing to two or three services separately.

For more bundles and eligibility information, you can explore these deals directly through the Disney Plus website. Shopping for additional discounts today? Check out the rest of our Black Friday coverage.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has broken his silence on a U.S.-backed peace plan to end the war in Ukraine, saying Moscow is ready for "serious" discussions about the draft proposals.

Putin said Thursday that the outlines of a draft peace plan that has been reached by the U.S. and Ukraine could be the basis of a deal that ends the almost four-year long conflict.

"In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements," Putin said in comments made during a trip to Kyrgyzstan and translated by Reuters.

The president added that the U.S. appeared to be taking Russia's position on a peace settlement "into account" and that Moscow was ready for "serious discussions" when U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff travels to Moscow next week for talks.

It's the first time Putin has publicly addressed a peace plan since a flurry of diplomacy between the U.S. and Ukraine in the last few days. Those talks came after reports last week of a U.S.-Russia devised 28-point peace plan, which appeared to heavily favor Russia's demands.  

Ukraine and its European allies' scrambled to mount a response, amending the plan and inserting counter proposals which were discussed in Geneva last weekend with a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. 

The current draft plan, which has reportedly been slimmed down to 19 key proposals, appears to have received Ukraine's tentative backing, putting the ball back in Russia's court as to whether it could accept the framework to build upon.

On Wednesday, Putin's close aide Yuri Ushakov had claimed that Russia had not even seen an official version of the latest U.S.-backed draft deal for Ukraine, but that it had seen an unofficial version.

Regarding the plan it had seen, Ushakov said the Kremlin viewed some aspects of the plan positively while "several of its points require serious analysis."

Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said Moscow welcomed U.S. efforts on peace proposals but said "there are no concessions on key issues on the Ukraine settlement," suggesting there could be some distance to travel before a deal is actually reached. 

On Thursday, Putin praised Russian advances in Ukraine and told reporters that the fighting in Ukraine would stops once Ukrainian troops withdraw from their positions in key areas. If they did not do so, then Russian forces will achieve their objectives by force, he added.

Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov warned on Wednesday against jumping to conclusions regarding an end to the war, which Russia launched when it invaded Ukraine in Feb. 2022.

"Wait. It's too early to say that," Peskov told reporters, state news agency TASS reported, when asked whether this was the closest Russia and Ukraine had ever been to concluding a peace agreement. 

CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for further comment and is awaiting a response.

Multiple outlets reported Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation that had held talks with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday appeared to tentatively support the basis of a U.S.-backed peace plan — though key details remained unresolved.

ABC News and CBS News both reported an unnamed U.S. official had said that the Ukrainians "have agreed" to the deal, while adding there were still points that had to be ironed out. It was unclear if both stories quoted the same U.S. official.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said later Tuesday that Kyiv was ready to advance the peace framework, Reuters reported, citing a copy of a speech the president gave to a coalition of allied countries.

U.S. President Donald Trump said at the White House on Tuesday, "I think we're getting very close to a deal. We'll find out ... I think we're making progress."

In a Truth Social post later Tuesday afternoon, Trump said, "there are only a few remaining points of disagreement."

Apple has filed a case in the Delhi High Court against the country's antitrust body because of how it considers global turnover when calculating penalties.

The iPhone maker, which is among the fastest-growing smartphone brands in India, is challenging India's new antitrust law under which the U.S. company could face fines of up to $38 billion, according to a report by Reuters.

Apple added that it was "unconstitutional, grossly disproportionate, unjust" for the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to use turnover when calculating penalties.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

The CCI has been investigating complaints from an alliance of Indian startups and Tinder-owner Match Group that accuse Apple of "abusive conduct," which forces developers to pay high commissions for in-app purchases. 

Apple denied the charges.

The CCI's final verdict is still pending, but it said its "prima facie view [is] that mandatory use of Apple's IAP for paid apps and in-app purchases restricts the choice available to the app developers to select a payment processing system of their choice," in an order in December 2021.

Apple recorded its highest-ever quarterly shipments in India of 5 million units in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from IDC. 

The company is expected to sell about 15 million iPhones in India this year and could rank among the top five smartphone companies there, Navkendar Singh, associate vice president with IDC India,  on Nov. 18.

Apple is among the global companies diversifying their manufacturing supply chains away from China to India. In 2024, Apple's exports from India hit a record of $12.8 billion, up more than 42% from a year earlier.

Puma shares finished 18.9% higher on Thursday following a report that China's Anta Sports is among a number of firms looking to buy the struggling German athletic brand.

Puma is in the middle of what is calls a "reset," as sales growth has dramatically dropped after a revenue bump during Covid-19. Post-pandemic, however, the brand has wrestled with fading customer resonance with customers and resulting high inventories.

Earlier this month, shares hit their lowest level in more than 10 years, while year-to-date losses amount to more than 50% amid an increasingly competitive sportswear market and tariffs hitting customer sentiment. 

The company is now reportedly considering a buy-out, according to a report from Bloomberg citing unnamed sources. Hong Kong-listed Anta Sports is said to weigh a potential bid for the sportswear maker, the outlet reported. 

Puma declined to comment and Anta Sports didn't immediately to respond to a CNBC request for comment.

For Anta, acquiring Puma could be a gateway to the Western world, said Metzler analyst Felix Dennl, noting the Chinese company's strong track record in turning around underperforming assets. "On the one hand, Anta already has broad-based international market exposure via its stake in Amer Group, hence the additional value add from Puma is expected to add to the portfolio is not completely clear," he added.

Puma may also attract interest from Chinese apparel firm Li Ning and Japan's Asics Corp, the Bloomberg report said. 

"As of now, the company has not engaged in any substantive negotiations or evaluations regarding the transaction mentioned in the news," Li Ning said in an emailed statement. Asics didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Puma's Frankfurt-listed shares were up 13.7% by 12:30 p.m. London time (7:30 a.m. ET), before ending the session up 18.9%.

Puma CEO Arthur Hoeld, who was appointed on July 1, is tasked with reviving the ailing brand. His turnaround plan involves cutting jobs, narrowing its product range, and improving marketing operations.

"At the end of July, we stated that 2025 would be a year of reset," Hoeld said in a statement on Oct. 30. "Since then, we have taken important steps to clean up PUMA's distribution, improve our cash management and reset our operational expenses. By expanding our cost efficiency programme, we are moving quickly to address challenges and make the business more efficient and resilient."

The company also said it is aiming to establish itself as a "Top 3 global sports brand," as it reported quarterly sales that fell on a double digit basis. 

Puma acknowledged that key challenges included a muted brand momentum, U.S. tariffs, and high inventory levels.

In July, the company cut its 2025 guidance, saying its now expecting a sales decline at a low double-digit percentage rate, from a previous guide of sales growth at a low- to mid-single digit percentage rate. 

It also said it expects to post an operating profit loss in 2025 — a huge swing from the previously expected profit of between 445 million euros ($516 million) and 525 million euros — due to the impact of tariffs. 

Puma's biggest shareholder is currently Artemis which holds a 29% stake in the company. Artemis — the holding company of France's billionaire Pinault family as well as the largest shareholder of Gucci-owner Kering — has been on a spending spree and has seen its debt balloon. 

Artemis' valuation expectations for Puma may be a major hurdle to any transaction involving the athletic brand, Bloomberg reported.

Monday - Friday, 11:00 - 12:00 SIN/HK  |  0500 - 06:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's "Inside India" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse. Subscribe here.

India lives in contradictions — think landing a spacecraft on moon but not getting basic infrastructure right, or being the world's fastest growing economy that has millions struggling to make ends meet. The country's labor market is yet another area emblematic of that paradox. 

While big businesses have bemoaned rigid labor market laws in the country, several startups have fast become unicorns, making use of the flexibility that came with employing vast armies of gig workers, many of whom have no employment protection or social welfare. 

Last Friday, when the Indian government announced labor reforms, consolidating 29 separate labor laws into four comprehensive codes, it attempted to address these incongruities — balancing business interests with employee welfare.

The implementation of labor codes is the second big reform from the Indian government in less than 90 days, as it strives to boost an economy facing headwinds from U.S. tariffs.

The goods and services tax rationalization in September sought to boost domestic consumption and the labor reform is expected to catalyze industrialization and attract more investments.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a post on X hailed the measures, saying the new codes "will build a future-ready ecosystem that protects the rights of workers and strengthens India's economic growth."

The reform is important for India as it addresses the problem of labor rigidity due to which "firms find it expensive to grow," unable to benefit from economies of scale, HSBC said in a note on Wednesday. 

India aims to be a developed country, with a $10 trillion economy, by 2047. To achieve that target, it needs to ramp up industrial production and attract investments from local and foreign companies. The country's complex web of labor laws have been a key hurdle to realizing those goals.

"Global companies would like to expand domestic manufacturing in India and sourcing from India," said Richard Rossow, senior advisor and chair, India and Emerging Asia Economics, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But for that to happen, companies need to see policy reforms including easing of "rigid labor laws," Rossow said. 

India-based policy think tank Observer Research Foundation has called the labor code changes "the biggest structural reform in India" since the country liberalized its economy in 1991. 

The recent GST reform impacted 12 million enterprises while the labor codes potentially engage 63 million enterprises, of which only 1 million are in the formal sector, ORF said. "The compliance leap from informal to formal will now be easier, as the ease of maintaining registers and filling forms reduces the tyranny of a corrupt and rent-seeking bureaucracy."

Under the new policy, gig workers will gain access to social security benefits, and startups will be required to allocate up to 2% of their turnover toward building a social security net for these workers.

Additionally, fixed term or contract employees will now qualify for benefits available to permanent workers, including leave, medical, and social security. 

On the flip side, according to a report by Nomura Research, the code makes it easier to retrench workers and "harder for workers to legally conduct strikes."

On Wednesday, trade unions backed by opposition political parties organized sporadic protest across the country, calling for a roll back of the reforms.

G. Sanjeeva Reddy, president of the Indian National Trade Union Congress, who led a protest in Hyderabad, a major IT hub in India, told CNBC they want the reforms to be repealed, claiming the measures were "unilaterally approved by the government."

India's Ministry of Labor and Employment did not respond to CNBC's request for comments. 

The new code has raised the threshold for requiring government permission to undertake retrenchments to 300 employees from 100 and allows states to raise that further. 

That flexibility will give an edge to states as they compete to attract large foreign and local industrial investments, similar to how provinces in China do, experts said. 

Under the wage code, the central government will soon fix a minimum base rate, with states also having the option to set their minimum wage above this rate.

"While the codes aim to create a unified national framework, states retain the power to frame many operational rules," said Preeti Sharma, partner, global employer services at business advisory firm BDO India.

"Given the competitive investment climate, some divergences are possible especially around threshold and local procedural requirements," she added.

Each state could implement the code differently and it "may be an initial headache for employers" but that is likely to be a transitory issue, said Arjun Paleri, partner at Mumbai-based law firm BTG Advaya. Both state and central governments can draft labor rules in India.

The labor reforms are also expected to lead to higher operational costs for companies that rely on fixed term employees such as those in the manufacturing or construction sectors, as well as for firms that employ gig workers.  

Over the last few years, India has seen a steep rise in the number of startups that employ gig workers for food and goods delivery, quick commerce, personal concierge and home services. 

According to government estimates, the number of gig workers in India is expected to rise to 23.5 million by fiscal year 2030, from about 10 million in fiscal year 2025.

The new rules around minimum wage, with states having the flexibility to set their own thresholds could impact this growth in the gig economy. 

"The e-commerce industries are going to get impacted heavily with much higher running costs given formal recognition of gig workers and platform workers," said Gerald Manoharan, partner at legal firm JSA.

Social benefits and contribution to welfare funds by aggregators are bound to affect the operating margin of such companies, before the costs are passed on to the customers, he added.

Big aggregators such as Zomato, Swiggy and Amazon, however, have "welcomed" the reforms, saying that they are evaluating the changes.

Under the new labor codes, fixed-term employees will be eligible to receive benefits equal to permanent workers, including leave, medical, and social security, potentially raising costs for manufacturing, infrastructure and real estate companies that employ a higher share of fixed-term or contract employees.

"Labour cost already makes up close to 25%-30% of our overall project cost," said Sujay Kalele, founder and CEO of Mumbai-based real estate firm Tru Realty, adding that his firm is expecting baseline labor cost to increase by 5%-10% over the next 18 months.

However, he said that updated provisions around workforce flexibility, smoother exit thresholds and longer shift options of 8-12 hours, could partly offset the cost escalation through productivity gains.

Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst at Kpler, said that Indian refiners will be adjusting their purchases of Russian oil rather than stopping them entirely.

Tan Teck Leng, UBS Global Wealth Management's executive director and APAC FX and macro strategist, said that his base case is for the Reserve Bank of India to cut rates one more time. 

Aditya Suresh, Macquarie Capital's head of India equity research, expects the country's quick-commerce companies to suffer to losses for "several years," beyond the one-year horizon that other analysts expect.

India's $33 billion defense production ambition is on track. Despite the recent crash of the India-made Tejas fighter jet at an airshow in Dubai, investors are bullish on New Delhi's defense ambitions as the country seeks to double its military production to 3 trillion rupees (about $33 billion) by 2029.

Global companies want to list their India units. Global companies are rushing to list their local business units in one of the world's busiest IPO markets.

Apple is contesting India's new antitrust penalty law. The law, enacted in 2024, allows India's Competition Commission to use a company's global turnover while imposing fines and it could expose the iPhone maker to a penalty of up to $38 billion, according to a report by Reuters.

We have more than 20 exporters coming to our office, because they are losing orders from Europe and America over the last couple of months. They [exporters] want to shift their business to domestic players, which is benefitting us.

— Akash Agarwal, chief executive officer, V2 Retail

A huge fire still burning in a Hong Kong apartment complex that has killed at least 55 people and left nearly 300 missing may have been caused by a "grossly negligent" construction firm using unsafe materials, police said on Thursday.

Almost a full day after the fire began, firefighters were struggling to reach residents potentially trapped on the upper floors of the Wang Fuk Court housing complex due to intense heat and thick smoke from the blaze that erupted on Wednesday afternoon.

The tightly packed complex in the northern Tai Po district has 2,000 apartments in eight blocks that are home to more than 4,600 people in a city struggling with chronic shortages of affordable housing.

"We bought in this building more than 20 years ago. All of our belongings were in this building, and now that it has all burned like this, what's left? asked a 51-year-old resident with the surname Wan.

"There's nothing left. What are we supposed to do?"

A woman surnamed Ng, 52, was distraught as she searched for her daughter outside a shelter.

"She and her father are still not out yet. They didn't have water to save our building," she sobbed, carrying her daughter's graduation photo.

Video from the scene showed flames leaping from at least two of the 32-storey towers sheathed in green construction mesh and bamboo scaffolding.

The fire was still burning on Thursday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it started. Authorities said they had brought the blaze in four of seven blocks under control, with operations continuing in three.

Bamboo scaffolding is a mainstay of traditional Chinese architecture but has been subject to a phase-out in Hong Kong since March for safety reasons.

Police officers searched the housing estate's building maintenance company on Thursday morning, seizing documents that mention Wang Fuk Court, local media reported. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"We have reason to believe that the company's responsible parties were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties," said Eileen Chung, a Hong Kong police superintendent.

Three men from the construction company, two directors and one engineering consultant, had been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter over the fire, she added.

Police said in addition to the buildings being covered with protective mesh sheets and plastic that may not meet fire standards, they discovered some windows on one unaffected building were sealed with a foam material, installed by a construction company carrying out year-long maintenance work.

A firefighter was among the 55 killed with dozens in hospital in critical condition, Hong Kong authorities said on Thursday afternoon. Around 279 people remain uncontactable.

Chung said 900 residents were spread across eight shelters.

Indonesia's foreign ministry said on Thursday that two Indonesian migrant workers "in the domestic sector" died in the fire and two others were injured.

The death toll is now the highest in a Hong Kong fire since 1948, when 176 people were killed in a warehouse blaze.

"The priority is to extinguish the fire and rescue the residents who are trapped," Hong Kong Hong Kong's corruption body said it has launched an investigation into suspected corruption related to the renovation. Lee told reporters. "The second is to support the injured. The third is to support and recover. Then, we'll launch a thorough investigation."

Harry Cheung, 66, who has lived at Block Two in one of the complexes for more than 40 years, said he heard a loud noise at about 2:45 p.m. (0645 GMT) and saw fire erupt in a nearby block.

"I immediately went back to pack up my things," he said.

"I don't even know how I feel right now. I'm just thinking about where I'm going to sleep tonight."

Another long-time resident, a woman surnamed Chu, said she still had not been able to contact her friends who live in the next block. After staying over at a friend's place on Wednesday night, the 70-year-old came back to see her home still burning.

"We don't know what to do," she said.

An online app showed missing persons reports submitted through a linked Google document that detailed residents of individual towers and rooms.

It includes descriptions like "Mother-in-law in her 70s, missing" or "one boy and one girl" or "Rooftop: 33-year-old male."

One description simply says "27th floor, room 1: He is dead." Reuters could not independently verify the information on the app.

The fire has prompted comparisons to the Grenfell Tower inferno that killed 72 people in London in 2017. That fire was blamed on firms fitting the exterior with flammable cladding, as well as failings by the government and the construction industry.

"Our hearts go out to all those affected by the horrific fire in Hong Kong," the Grenfell United survivors' group said on social media. "To the families, friends and communities, we stand with you. You are not alone."

Many residents took to social media to criticise what they saw as negligence and cost-cutting as a cause of the fire. One video showed several construction workers smoking on the bamboo scaffolding surrounding one of the complex's blocks during the renovation process.

From the mainland, China's President Xi Jinping urged an "all-out effort" to extinguish the fire and to minimise casualties and losses, China's state broadcaster CCTV said.

Hong Kong's Transport Department said that a number of roads would remain closed in the area on Thursday morning and 39 bus routes have been diverted, while nearby schools have been closed.

Hong Kong's sky-high property prices have long been a trigger for social discontent in the city and the fire tragedy could further stoke resentment towards authorities ahead of a city-wide legislative election in early December.

Wang Fuk Court is one of many high-rise housing complexes in Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Tai Po, located near the border with mainland China, is an established suburban district with some 300,000 residents.

Occupied since 1983, the complex is under the government's subsidised home ownership scheme, according to property agency websites. According to online posts, it has been undergoing renovations for a year at a cost of HK$330 million ($42.43 million), with each unit paying between HK$160,000 and HK$180,000.

Hong Kong's corruption body said it has launched an investigation into suspected corruption related to the renovation.

Animoca Brands co-founder Yat Siu says the company is preparing to become one of the most comprehensive vehicles for investors seeking exposure to altcoins and Web3 ecosystems, as the firm aims to go public via a reverse merger next year. Speaking with Cointelegraph, Siu argued that altcoins collectively will outperform Bitcoin over the long term because they capture the broader economic activity happening across crypto applications.

“We believe that altcoins, ultimately, over the largest space, are going to outperform Bitcoin as a collective,” he said, drawing a parallel between Bitcoin's role in crypto and gold's role in traditional markets. While gold remains a dominant store of value, Siu noted that the combined market capitalization of all public companies is “five to six times gold,” underscoring how a diverse set of growth-focused assets can surpass a single reserve asset.

Siu clarified that while Bitcoin may function effectively as a reserve asset, most real industry activity—gaming, DeFi, gas fees, blockchain infrastructure, and even memecoins—occurs through altcoins. For investors seeking exposure to the growth side of Web3, he said, Bitcoin alone does not capture the opportunity set.

Siu described Animoca's strategy as similar to the venture opportunities available at the dawn of the internet. Investors in the early 2000s could back Amazon, Google, eBay, Alibaba, and dozens of other emerging platforms at formative stages. The difference today, Siu said, is that crypto is unlikely to produce a “winner-takes-all” dynamic. Instead, the industry will support a wide ecosystem of specialized networks and tokens—a landscape where exposure to multiple altcoins may produce better outcomes than betting on a single chain or protocol.

“All of these applications are actually altcoins,” he emphasized, adding that even memecoins fall under the same umbrella as long as they power ecosystems or serve particular communities. Animoca's thesis is that a long-tail portfolio—spanning gaming, infrastructure, DeFi, and new Web3 categories—offers the best chance to capture the highest-performing assets.

The company already holds stakes in 628 projects, with 230 in gaming alone. Other strong verticals include artificial intelligence, decentralized finance, and blockchain infrastructure. Siu said that Animoca's investment scale gives it access to tokens at lower entry points than retail or even institutional secondary markets, and the company intends to “pass that benefit” to shareholders once it goes public.

Animoca Brands is expected to pursue a Nasdaq listing via a reverse merger with Currenc Group, an AI-focused fintech company. The listing route offers a faster, more flexible path than a traditional IPO at a time when U.S. markets are warming back up to selected crypto-adjacent companies. A public listing would also give Animoca a new capital base to expand its investment portfolio and potentially acquire more Web3 projects at scale.

Siu said the company's strategy is to build a diversified treasury of altcoins that mirrors how a technology conglomerate would accumulate early-stage stakes in internet companies. The idea is not to pick one dominant blockchain, but to invest widely enough that Animoca captures a meaningful share of future winners—whether in gaming, identity, infrastructure, tokenized experiences, or decentralized compute (DePIN).

He also noted that Bitcoin's role is fundamentally different: strong as collateral and a reserve asset, but not where the majority of Web3 application development happens. “We didn't join crypto to just hold Bitcoin,” he said. “Its utility is limited for the kind of ecosystem growth we're investing in.”

If Animoca succeeds with its U.S. listing, the company may become a benchmark for public-market exposure to diversified crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its altcoin-heavy strategy aligns with emerging narratives in Web3 where application-layer tokens—gaming assets, L2 governance tokens, DeFi protocols, payment networks, and digital identity systems—could outperform larger, more mature assets during the next adoption wave.

Animoca's bet is that Web3 will mirror the internet era: not one dominant network, but thousands of applications with specific use cases and their own economic models. With hundreds of investments already on its balance sheet, Animoca is positioning itself to catch whichever tokens or sectors break out next.

As the crypto market transitions from speculative cycles to more structured investment themes—gaming, user-owned networks, decentralized compute, AI-Web3 convergence—Animoca Brands is trying to place itself at the center of the altcoin opportunity. Whether the reverse merger accelerates that strategy will likely be a key storyline for crypto investors in 2025.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has donated approximately $765,000 in ETH to two privacy messaging apps, Session and SimpleX—two apps looking to break past sector leaders Signal and Telegram.

Buterin has become an increasingly vocal advocate for privacy solutions in the crypto industry, as global policies have expanded fears of global surveillance states and irked those wanting to keep their personal lives private.

“Encrypted messaging, like Signal, is critical for preserving our digital privacy,” Buterin tweeted. “Two important next steps for the space are (i) permissionless account creation and (ii) metadata privacy. Session and SimpleX are two messaging apps pushing these directions forward.”

Session brands itself as a decentralized “end-to-end encrypted messenger” that aims to have “minimum metadata leakage”—metadata is information that surrounds a piece of content, such as an IP address or the time it was sent. It also has a token, SESH, which is up 371% on the day to a market capitalization of $15 million, according to CoinGecko.

SimpleX is also a decentralized end-to-end encrypted messenger, although its focus is on users owning their “identities, contacts, and communities.” Next year, it will introduce “vouchers” that users will be required to purchase and donate to communities, such as the Bitcoin community, to host the required servers.

“Neither of the two are perfect pieces of software,” Buterin cautioned, adding that both “have a way to go” to optimize user experience and security.

“Strong metadata privacy requires decentralization, decentralization is hard, users expecting multi-device support makes everything harder,” he continued. “Sybil / DoS resistance, both in the message routing network and on the user side (without forcing phone number dependence) adds further difficulty.”

Interest in privacy-focused apps and crypto projects has surged in recent months, as it appears that governments are cracking down on the digital landscape.

"People are increasingly living their lives in digital spaces. These spaces are vulnerable to a level of surveillance that has no equivalent in the physical world," Zac Williamson, co-founder of privacy-focused Ethereum layer-2 network Aztec Network, told Decrypt. "Privacy is important so that individuals can act as free agents in their online interactions, as opposed to being digital commodities whose data is harvested, sold to the highest bidder and weaponised against the user's interests.”

'Privacy Is Hygiene,' Says Ethereum Creator Vitalik Buterin After Bank Data Leak

Maybe most notably, earlier this year, the UK government started to require its citizens to show identification if they want to access adult content online, and is looking to introduce a digital ID scheme. Equally, on Wednesday, the Council of the European Union agreed to allow messaging apps to scan content to protect children online in what skeptics have labeled “Chat Control.”

Earlier this month, Buterin said that “privacy is hygiene,” following a security breach that impacted several major U.S. banks. In October, the Ethereum Foundation launched a new privacy team with 28 members, with plans to expand its privacy-related projects and initiatives.

Throughout this period, privacy-focused crypto tokens have surged. Zcash, for example, has soared a dizzying 793% to $501 over the past year, according to CoinGecko, despite a 27% decline over the past week.

Peter Schiff is once again sounding the alarm, this time warning that companies using Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) or Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) as corporate treasury strategies are ultimately doomed.

What Happened: Speaking on Schwab Network, Schiff argued that Strategy's (NASDAQ:MSTR) Bitcoin-leveraged model is structurally unsound.

He said the company generates no meaningful earnings, piles on losses, and survives only by issuing new debt or equity to buy more Bitcoin, an asset that yields no cash flow.

Don't Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

According to Schiff, the moment Strategy's stock trades below the value of its Bitcoin holdings, the entire "yield loop" breaks.

At that point, the firm can no longer raise fresh capital, triggering a debt-driven unwind that forces BTC sales and potentially accelerates a broader market crash.

He also claimed Bitcoin's inability to rally despite a wave of bullish catalysts, spot ETFs, a crypto-friendly president, and heavy political support, shows the market is exhausted.

In his view, whales used the hype to exit while retail investors absorbed the top.

As a result, Schiff warns that today's market is dominated by leveraged, weak-hand buyers, a setup he believes could lead to a rapid collapse unless the government intervenes.

Why It Matters: Schiff compared the current crypto landscape to past speculative bubbles, arguing that the digital-asset boom is larger than the dot-com mania and "built on nothing."

By contrast, he says AI is a real but overheated sector that will undergo a shakeout before reshaping the global economy.

He predicts most crypto assets will ultimately go to zero, with tokenized gold emerging as the only sustainable blockchain application.

Schiff concluded by saying that every corporation running a Bitcoin- or Ethereum-based treasury model will eventually end up insolvent because their business hinges entirely on speculative enthusiasm rather than a viable revenue engine.

Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen

Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.

For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.

Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.

Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.

For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.

Hold onto your hats, because the cryptocurrency landscape is anything but stable. At the heart of this storm lies Bitcoin, witnessing waves of both exhilaration and anxiety among investors. Recent market shifts expose a turbulent relationship with Bitcoin's value and its associated ETFs. Traditional titans, like BlackRock, feel the tremors of these upheavals, while up-and-coming players such as Solana and XRP are emerging as fascinating alternatives for optimistic investors.

Once revered as the gold standard, Bitcoin now provokes caution amongst serious investors. Just recently, a staggering $255 million flowed out of Bitcoin ETFs, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust suffering a dramatic one-day withdrawal of $146 million. These incidents send shockwaves through the market, as macroeconomic fears—like unpredictable interest rates and pending regulations—loom large over even the most trusted investment pathways. This flight of capital points to a seismic shift: the unshakable belief in Bitcoin is proving fragile.

Despite Bitcoin maintaining a semblance of price steadiness, the trend of significant outflows is a clear signal of wavering investor sentiment. It compels many to rethink their strategies—are alternative investments slipping through their fingers? Major players are cautiously reevaluating their positions, bringing into question whether Bitcoin-centric strategies can endure in this landscape of uncertainty.

While Bitcoin wrestles with its own volatility, altcoin ETFs are beginning to shine. Take, for instance, the remarkable $55.61 million inflow into Solana ETFs on November 19, a striking contrast to the prevailing trend. This increasing attention toward altcoins hints at a potential turning tide in the investment arena. With its innovative framework and enthusiastic community backing, Solana offers a beacon of stability in a stormy market.

XRP isn't just trailing in Solana's wake; it is also making waves, demonstrating solid net inflows that reflect growing market confidence. In a single week alone, XRP attracted $221 million in net inflows, capturing the interest of investors eager for robust and reliable investments. These altcoins are increasingly perceived as viable diversifiers, capitalizing on their distinct technological advancements as an antidote to Bitcoin's recent turbulence.

Investors are not mere spectators in this evolving theater of finance; they are reshaping their investment narratives. A notable trend reflects a growing inclination toward diversification within cryptocurrency ETFs instead of relying solely on Bitcoin. The development of new financial instruments, such as the Vanguard Bitcoin ETF, signals that portfolio managers are adjusting their strategies, creating a more balanced investment landscape that invites diverse capital.

This evolution towards alternative assets illustrates an acute recognition of the risks associated with Bitcoin's volatility. It signifies an intelligent, adaptive approach to managing assets, showcasing how both individual investors and institutions are recognizing risk management as imperative amid fluctuating market conditions.

Yet, navigating this vibrant cryptocurrency ecosystem is rife with challenges. Regulatory compliance looms as a daunting barrier for many burgeoning firms in the U.S. The continuously shifting market environment presents its own set of complications, with innovative solutions often stifled by legal entanglements. This results in operational inefficiencies, leaving many to question whether decentralized finance (DeFi) could serve as a viable framework.

Signs of a shift toward DeFi solutions are emerging, with their promise of smoother compatibility with existing financial infrastructures, reducing liquidity and compliance challenges. As innovation takes center stage, the future of cryptocurrency investments may hinge on successfully balancing transformative technologies with regulatory considerations.

Bitcoin's tumultuous journey juxtaposes sharply against the growing enthusiasm for altcoins, as evidenced by the rising tide of investment in Solana and XRP. This evolving narrative beckons investors to broaden their horizons while contending with the inherent risks linked to Bitcoin and traditional assets. The market is changing, and success will demand adaptability and strategic foresight in this dynamic digital landscape.

In this exciting new chapter, we aren't just witnessing incremental shifts but a profound metamorphosis in asset strategies. The pursuit of stability amidst the unpredictability of cryptocurrency heralds a new era of portfolio diversification, emphasizing the vital need for a more engaged and savvy approach to these digital investments. The moment to seize these opportunities is upon us, presenting a fertile ground for those bold enough to brave the waves.

Oops, something went wrong

Metaplanet's shares surged by about 7% on Thursday after the digital asset treasury firm revealed it has loaned $130 million to buy even more Bitcoin.

And the Japanese hotel operator-turned Bitcoin treasury firm isn't alone: Other DAT shares also surged on the back of the news, even outpacing the Nikkei 225, an index of leading Tokyo Stock Exchange shares, which rose just over 1% on Thursday.

Remixpoint, an energy provider and former crypto exchange operator, has also seen its share prices rise by 8.7% in the past 24 hours. The company holds Bitcoin worth $128 million.

Rival DATs SBC Medical Group Holdings, Gumi, and Agile Media Network saw their own share prices grow by 5%, 3%, and 1% respectively.

The share price rise also outstrips the growth of Bitcoin prices, which rose by around 0.24% in the same period.

This appears to suggest that the market was reacting positively to the news of Metaplanet's intention to ramp up its Bitcoin buying despite recent crypto market price drops.

The deal also comes as traders are growing weary of DATs.

While the business plan pioneered by Michael Saylor's Strategy attracted hundreds of copycats earlier this year, many of these firms' shares are now worth less than their underlying assets. This raises questions about their viability as businesses.

The interest rate on Metaplanet's latest loan is floating, and will renew on a daily basis, Metaplanet wrote in a filing declaration.

This is the second such loan Metaplanet has taken to buy additional Bitcoin, although the lender's identity “has not been disclosed due to their own wishes,” the Japanese crypto journalist K. Kobayashi wrote in the Japanese publication CoinPost.

Metaplanet said the terms of the loan allow the firm to pay its debt “at any time.”

The Japanese company has previously established a $500 million credit facility to help it continue its aggressive Bitcoin buying strategy.

Japanese firms are growing increasingly bullish on crypto adoption. Earlier this month, six of the country's biggest asset managers signalled their interest in launching crypto funds for retail and institutional investors.

The group has assets under management worth a combined $2.5 trillion, and includes the wealth management arm of the Japanese megabank Mitsubishi UFJ.

Regulators are also mulling proposals to green-light the inclusion of crypto in mutual funds, in addition to pro-business crypto tax reforms.

By CryptoNinjas Editorial Team

Kraken just made its move into the public market spotlight. The crypto exchange confirmed Wednesday that it had filed paperwork with the SEC to go public, setting the stage for what could be one of the year's most-watched digital currency IPOs. 



The timing wasn't random. Just hours before announcing the IPO filing, Kraken closed an $800 million funding round, valuing the company at $20 billion. Ken Griffin's Citadel Securities threw in $200 million, signaling serious Wall Street interest in the crypto exchange business.

The Wyoming-based platform plans to use that cash to push into new markets outside the US and build out payment features. As crypto adoption broadens, investors are paying closer attention to which platforms are best positioned to support the growing range of use cases, from cross-border payments and tokenized real-world assets to on-chain gaming and decentralized identity tools. Even the entertainment sector is leaning in, with online casinos adopting digital assets to enable faster payouts and global access. In that space, operators are routinely reviewed and ranked for security, licensing, and user trust, a level of scrutiny that is increasingly being applied to crypto exchanges as competition intensifies. And as more casinos experiment with provably fair systems and blockchain-based payment rails, they offer a glimpse into how digital assets can streamline user experiences across other sectors as well.

Kraken was founded in 2011 and has survived many crypto winters. It has benefited from regulatory relief, especially after it transitioned to a publicly traded company, following the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) dismissing a complaint against Kraken in March 2025 regarding staking. This dismissal allowed the company to move forward with its next phase.

Kraken allows users to buy/sell/trade the largest cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether, and, in Europe, it also provides tokenized equities trading, enabling European customers with another way to access equity markets.

Kraken won't be alone on Wall Street. Before Trump's return to office in January, Coinbase was the only crypto exchange with publicly traded shares. That changed fast in 2025. Gemini Space Station hit the market in September, while Bullish made its debut in August. Circle, the stablecoin issuer, also went public in June with a $1 billion raise.

The initial excitement around these listings has cooled considerably. Bullish shares shot past $118 during their August IPO but have since dropped to around $35.66. Gemini's story is even rougher as its stock has fallen by more than 68% from its September debut to about $11.70, hurt by weak third-quarter results.

The fact that this price drop is raising serious concerns about whether a new major cryptocurrency exchange IPO (Initial Public Offering) can proceed. There are no details from Kraken on how many shares will be sold or the price range at which they will be offered. According to a Kraken release, the public offering will be made by Kraken only after we receive a response from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding our registration statement, provided that market conditions are favorable.

As mentioned above, the latter point makes more sense than one may think. Although the broader IPO market is improving in terms of volume in 2025, historically, we've seen crypto equities to be very volatile, regardless of how well a business is doing financially.



Kraken's filing represents more than just another company going public. It reflects how much the relationship between crypto and traditional finance has shifted in the past year. When major players like Citadel Securities write nine-figure checks for crypto platforms, it signals that digital assets have moved well past their fringe status.

The question now is whether public market investors will see Kraken differently than they've treated Gemini and Bullish. The exchange has size and history on its side, plus that fresh $20 billion valuation backed by serious institutional money. But recent track records suggest the market isn't just handing out wins to crypto companies with good stories anymore.

Seoul, Korea, November 27th, 2025, Chainwire

IntelliQuant CEO Lee Jong‑kwon officially introduced LUMINT, a decentralized distributed reward system, during his keynote address at the “AI & Blockchain Conference” held in Cheongju, Chungcheongbuk-do.

In his presentation, Lee described LUMINT as “a decentralized distributed reward system based on a hybrid-incentive model of node staking,” positioning it as “a new model that ensures both sustainability and fairness.”

He also identified key structural issues affecting the current cryptocurrency ecosystem, including resource inefficiencies and centralization in PoW mining, complexity and liquidity risks in PoS and DeFi models, high price volatility, short-term speculation, and a lack of practical utility—factors he said continue to impact the long-term sustainability of the industry.

To address these issues, Lumint was designed with a “hybrid structure” that preserves strengths while improving weaknesses. For example, instead of a simple ICO during fundraising, Lumint uses a node-purchase model to prevent early investors from leaving after quick profits; staking ensures rewards over 900 days. Another distinguishing feature is that, rather than enforcing a strict lock-up period, the structure allows users to start earning profit immediately after staking. 
		



Additionally, funds gathered through staking are connected to AI-based investment services to generate additional financial returns, and a “smart mining” system that automatically adjusts mining output is applied. Lee explained that the smart mining system is “a mechanism that reduces resource waste and efficiently controls coin circulation.” 

The Lumint Node Staking Framework (LNSF) is characterized by: node-based coin distribution, performance-based incentives, an automatic adjustment mechanism, and an initial 100% node-based allocation system. 



System development is also being pursued on a Web3 foundation with additional features: “Web3 first,” dynamic translation system to support global service, minimal maintenance points for rapid scaling, deterministic algorithm-based fair rewards, and UX built on Next.js. Lee added that Lumint embodies four values: transparency, scalability, accessibility, and fairness. 

A hybrid platform combining Web3 technology with Web2-friendly usability is under development. The platform aims to support familiar user experiences like Google or Apple email login or SMS OTP, while reward logic is verifiable on-chain. Especially, with account abstraction technology, it reduces complex account management and can support gas fee sponsorship. 
		



Moreover, an AI-powered investment platform is being prepared, which will offer services such as intelligent investment signal alerts, AI-powered automated investment management (robo-advisor), and customized crypto trend report alerts.  Lee said the plan is to manage funds by diversifying and controlling risk using four foundations: portfolio management, quantitative trading, professional staff, and platform technology. 

Currently, the crypto robo-advisor is in prototype testing. In addition, Lumint was recently selected as a broker partner by global exchange OKX — laying the groundwork for overseas market expansion.

In the high-stakes theater of modern warfare, the reliability of artificial intelligence has transitioned from a theoretical computer science problem to a matter of national security. As the Department of Defense accelerates its push toward autonomous systems, a critical vulnerability has emerged: the inability to verify that an AI model deployed on a drone or missile system hasn't been tampered with by adversaries. Addressing this trust deficit, Raytheon, a titan of the defense industrial base, has formally integrated cryptographic startup Lagrange into its vendor network. The move signals a pivotal shift in how defense primes approach software procurement, moving beyond perimeter security to intrinsic algorithmic verification.
The integration centers on Lagrange's proprietary “DeepProve” technology, a system rooted in Zero-Knowledge (ZK) cryptography—a field previously dominated by blockchain privacy applications. According to a disclosure released by the startup, the technology is now embedded within Raytheon's broader ecosystem, specifically targeting the verification of defense applications where data integrity is paramount. This partnership positions Lagrange to capture a slice of the estimated $30 billion currently allocated for U.S. military AI contracts, a figure that reflects the Pentagon's aggressive pivot toward software-defined warfare under initiatives like the Replicator program.
 


 
Cryptographic Certainty in Kinetic Warfare
The core of this collaboration addresses the “black box” dilemma inherent in deep learning models. Unlike traditional code, which follows explicit logic, modern AI operates on probabilistic weights derived from vast datasets. If an adversary were to “poison” this training data or subtly alter the model's weights during transmission to a tactical edge device, the consequences could be catastrophic—ranging from fratricide to the failure of critical intelligence gathering. According to Lagrange's announcement, their DeepProve technology ensures tamper-resistant intelligence, effectively creating a digital fingerprint for AI models that proves their integrity without revealing the underlying proprietary algorithms or classified data.
Industry observers note that Raytheon's decision to onboard a cryptographic specialist underscores a broader anxiety within the defense sector regarding supply chain security. As reported by Defense News, the Department of Defense has increasingly scrutinized the software bill of materials (SBOM) for all vendors. However, Lagrange offers something distinct: mathematical proof of execution. By utilizing Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), Raytheon can theoretically verify that a specific output—such as a target identification—was generated by a specific, authorized model version, ensuring that the system has not been hijacked by electronic warfare tactics or cyber-intrusion.
The Thirty-Billion-Dollar Trust Gap
The financial contours of this partnership highlight the immense capital flowing into trusted autonomy. With the U.S. military's AI budget swelling to encompass everything from predictive maintenance to autonomous wingmen, the market for “AI assurance” is rapidly expanding. The Wall Street Journal has previously reported on the Pentagon's struggle to bridge the gap between Silicon Valley innovation and Beltway bureaucracy. The Raytheon-Lagrange integration represents a successful bridging of this divide, allowing a legacy prime contractor to leverage agile, cutting-edge cryptography to meet the rigorous compliance standards of the DoD's Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC).
For Raytheon, the stakes are competitive as well as tactical. As new entrants like Anduril and Palantir challenge the dominance of traditional defense contractors, the incumbents are under pressure to demonstrate that their hardware is not just kinetic, but intelligent and secure. By integrating DeepProve, Raytheon effectively insures its AI products against the growing threat of adversarial machine learning. This capability is likely to become a standard requirement in future procurement cycles, where the provenance of an algorithm will be scrutinized as heavily as the physical components of a munition.
Securing the Digital Kill Chain
The operational implication of this technology extends to the tactical edge—the remote, disconnected environments where bandwidth is low and jamming is frequent. In these scenarios, verifying the integrity of a command is difficult. Lagrange's technology allows for “lightweight” proofs that can be verified on hardware with limited processing power. This means a drone swarm could theoretically verify updates to its targeting logic mid-flight without needing a persistent, high-bandwidth connection to a central command server, a capability that Aviation Week describes as essential for future near-peer conflicts.
Furthermore, this integration speaks to the rising threat of “data poisoning,” where adversaries subtly manipulate training data to create backdoors in AI models. A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) highlighted this as a top-tier threat to national security. DeepProve's architecture mitigates this by creating a cryptographic chain of custody for the model's evolution. If the weights of the neural network are altered by a byte, the proof fails, and the system can automatically revert to a safe mode or reject the command, providing a fail-safe that is mathematically guaranteed rather than just firewalled.
From Blockchain to Battlefield
The trajectory of Lagrange from a cryptographic startup, likely rooted in the decentralized finance or Web3 sector, to a Raytheon vendor illustrates the increasing dual-use nature of privacy-preserving technologies. Zero-Knowledge proofs were originally popularized to scale blockchains like Ethereum. However, the underlying mathematics—proving knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself—maps perfectly to classified environments. The military needs to verify that allies or contractors are running the correct software without necessarily exposing the source code or the classified training data to every node in the network.
This “need-to-know” architecture is central to the Pentagon's Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) strategy. As disparate systems from the Air Force, Navy, and Army attempt to share data in real-time, the attack surface expands exponentially. Bloomberg Government analysis suggests that the next generation of defense contracts will favor vendors who can demonstrate “Zero Trust” architectures not just in network access, but in computational integrity. Lagrange's entry into the Raytheon ecosystem is a bellwether for this trend, suggesting that the future of defense contracting will require deep cryptographic competency.
Auditability as a Strategic Advantage
Beyond immediate security, the partnership addresses a looming regulatory hurdle: AI auditability. As the U.S. government moves toward regulating AI safety, defense agencies must ensure their autonomous systems adhere to the Laws of Armed Conflict. This requires an immutable audit trail of why an AI made a specific decision. Lagrange's technology facilitates this by generating verifiable proofs of the computation process. If a drone strikes a target, commanders can mathematically prove that the system was executing valid, authorized code at the moment of engagement, offering a layer of legal and ethical cover that is currently missing in black-box AI systems.
This capability serves as a significant differentiator for Raytheon in competitive bidding processes. While other contractors may offer higher performance or lower costs, the ability to offer “provable security” creates a moat around their offerings. In an era where cyber-warfare is constant, the assurance that a weapon system cannot be hacked to turn against its operators is a value proposition that commands a premium. The $30 billion market opportunity is not just about building better AI, but about building AI that the Pentagon can trust implicitly.
The Evolution of Defense Procurement
The integration of a niche cryptographic player into a massive defense conglomerate also highlights the evolving procurement strategies of the “Big Five” defense contractors. Historically, companies like Raytheon would attempt to build such capabilities in-house, a process that is often slow and costly. By acting as a platform integrator for specialized startups like Lagrange, Raytheon accelerates its time-to-market for secure AI solutions. This mirrors the commercial tech sector's approach, where giants like Microsoft or Google acquire or partner with specialized security firms to bolster their cloud offerings.
This shift is likely to spur further M&A activity and partnerships within the defense technology space. Startups specializing in homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, and other privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) are now viewing the Department of Defense not as a bureaucratic labyrinth, but as a viable, high-revenue customer. As TechCrunch has noted in its defense tech coverage, the “valley of death”—the gap between a pilot program and a program of record—is being bridged by these strategic partnerships with prime contractors who already hold the keys to the kingdom.
A New Standard for Algorithmic Warfare
Ultimately, the Raytheon-Lagrange alliance sets a precedent for the industry. It establishes that functional performance is no longer the sole metric for military AI; verification is now equally critical. As adversaries develop more sophisticated methods to spoof, jam, and subvert autonomous systems, the layer of protection provided by cryptographic proofs will transition from a luxury to a necessity. The “DeepProve” integration is an early indicator of a future where every algorithm deployed in a conflict zone will carry a cryptographic certificate of authenticity.
For the broader market, this signals that the intersection of cryptography and artificial intelligence is the next frontier for defense investment. The $30 billion earmarked for AI contracts is likely just the beginning, with a significant portion of future funding diverted specifically toward AI assurance and security. As the fog of war becomes increasingly digital, the ability to pierce that fog with mathematical certainty becomes the ultimate strategic asset.


In the high-stakes theater of modern warfare, the reliability of artificial intelligence has transitioned from a theoretical computer science problem to a matter of national security. As the Department of Defense accelerates its push toward autonomous systems, a critical vulnerability has emerged: the inability to verify that an AI model deployed on a drone or missile system hasn't been tampered with by adversaries. Addressing this trust deficit, Raytheon, a titan of the defense industrial base, has formally integrated cryptographic startup Lagrange into its vendor network. The move signals a pivotal shift in how defense primes approach software procurement, moving beyond perimeter security to intrinsic algorithmic verification.

The integration centers on Lagrange's proprietary “DeepProve” technology, a system rooted in Zero-Knowledge (ZK) cryptography—a field previously dominated by blockchain privacy applications. According to a disclosure released by the startup, the technology is now embedded within Raytheon's broader ecosystem, specifically targeting the verification of defense applications where data integrity is paramount. This partnership positions Lagrange to capture a slice of the estimated $30 billion currently allocated for U.S. military AI contracts, a figure that reflects the Pentagon's aggressive pivot toward software-defined warfare under initiatives like the Replicator program.
 


 
Cryptographic Certainty in Kinetic Warfare
The core of this collaboration addresses the “black box” dilemma inherent in deep learning models. Unlike traditional code, which follows explicit logic, modern AI operates on probabilistic weights derived from vast datasets. If an adversary were to “poison” this training data or subtly alter the model's weights during transmission to a tactical edge device, the consequences could be catastrophic—ranging from fratricide to the failure of critical intelligence gathering. According to Lagrange's announcement, their DeepProve technology ensures tamper-resistant intelligence, effectively creating a digital fingerprint for AI models that proves their integrity without revealing the underlying proprietary algorithms or classified data.
Industry observers note that Raytheon's decision to onboard a cryptographic specialist underscores a broader anxiety within the defense sector regarding supply chain security. As reported by Defense News, the Department of Defense has increasingly scrutinized the software bill of materials (SBOM) for all vendors. However, Lagrange offers something distinct: mathematical proof of execution. By utilizing Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), Raytheon can theoretically verify that a specific output—such as a target identification—was generated by a specific, authorized model version, ensuring that the system has not been hijacked by electronic warfare tactics or cyber-intrusion.
The Thirty-Billion-Dollar Trust Gap
The financial contours of this partnership highlight the immense capital flowing into trusted autonomy. With the U.S. military's AI budget swelling to encompass everything from predictive maintenance to autonomous wingmen, the market for “AI assurance” is rapidly expanding. The Wall Street Journal has previously reported on the Pentagon's struggle to bridge the gap between Silicon Valley innovation and Beltway bureaucracy. The Raytheon-Lagrange integration represents a successful bridging of this divide, allowing a legacy prime contractor to leverage agile, cutting-edge cryptography to meet the rigorous compliance standards of the DoD's Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC).
For Raytheon, the stakes are competitive as well as tactical. As new entrants like Anduril and Palantir challenge the dominance of traditional defense contractors, the incumbents are under pressure to demonstrate that their hardware is not just kinetic, but intelligent and secure. By integrating DeepProve, Raytheon effectively insures its AI products against the growing threat of adversarial machine learning. This capability is likely to become a standard requirement in future procurement cycles, where the provenance of an algorithm will be scrutinized as heavily as the physical components of a munition.
Securing the Digital Kill Chain
The operational implication of this technology extends to the tactical edge—the remote, disconnected environments where bandwidth is low and jamming is frequent. In these scenarios, verifying the integrity of a command is difficult. Lagrange's technology allows for “lightweight” proofs that can be verified on hardware with limited processing power. This means a drone swarm could theoretically verify updates to its targeting logic mid-flight without needing a persistent, high-bandwidth connection to a central command server, a capability that Aviation Week describes as essential for future near-peer conflicts.
Furthermore, this integration speaks to the rising threat of “data poisoning,” where adversaries subtly manipulate training data to create backdoors in AI models. A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) highlighted this as a top-tier threat to national security. DeepProve's architecture mitigates this by creating a cryptographic chain of custody for the model's evolution. If the weights of the neural network are altered by a byte, the proof fails, and the system can automatically revert to a safe mode or reject the command, providing a fail-safe that is mathematically guaranteed rather than just firewalled.

The $30 billion earmarked for AI contracts is likely just the beginning, with a significant portion of future funding diverted specifically toward AI assurance and security. As the fog of war becomes increasingly digital, the ability to pierce that fog with mathematical certainty becomes the ultimate strategic asset.


Industry observers note that Raytheon's decision to onboard a cryptographic specialist underscores a broader anxiety within the defense sector regarding supply chain security. As reported by Defense News, the Department of Defense has increasingly scrutinized the software bill of materials (SBOM) for all vendors. However, Lagrange offers something distinct: mathematical proof of execution. By utilizing Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), Raytheon can theoretically verify that a specific output—such as a target identification—was generated by a specific, authorized model version, ensuring that the system has not been hijacked by electronic warfare tactics or cyber-intrusion.

The Thirty-Billion-Dollar Trust Gap
The financial contours of this partnership highlight the immense capital flowing into trusted autonomy. With the U.S. military's AI budget swelling to encompass everything from predictive maintenance to autonomous wingmen, the market for “AI assurance” is rapidly expanding. The Wall Street Journal has previously reported on the Pentagon's struggle to bridge the gap between Silicon Valley innovation and Beltway bureaucracy. The Raytheon-Lagrange integration represents a successful bridging of this divide, allowing a legacy prime contractor to leverage agile, cutting-edge cryptography to meet the rigorous compliance standards of the DoD's Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC).
For Raytheon, the stakes are competitive as well as tactical. As new entrants like Anduril and Palantir challenge the dominance of traditional defense contractors, the incumbents are under pressure to demonstrate that their hardware is not just kinetic, but intelligent and secure. By integrating DeepProve, Raytheon effectively insures its AI products against the growing threat of adversarial machine learning. This capability is likely to become a standard requirement in future procurement cycles, where the provenance of an algorithm will be scrutinized as heavily as the physical components of a munition.
Securing the Digital Kill Chain
The operational implication of this technology extends to the tactical edge—the remote, disconnected environments where bandwidth is low and jamming is frequent. In these scenarios, verifying the integrity of a command is difficult. Lagrange's technology allows for “lightweight” proofs that can be verified on hardware with limited processing power. This means a drone swarm could theoretically verify updates to its targeting logic mid-flight without needing a persistent, high-bandwidth connection to a central command server, a capability that Aviation Week describes as essential for future near-peer conflicts.
Furthermore, this integration speaks to the rising threat of “data poisoning,” where adversaries subtly manipulate training data to create backdoors in AI models. A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) highlighted this as a top-tier threat to national security. DeepProve's architecture mitigates this by creating a cryptographic chain of custody for the model's evolution. If the weights of the neural network are altered by a byte, the proof fails, and the system can automatically revert to a safe mode or reject the command, providing a fail-safe that is mathematically guaranteed rather than just firewalled.
From Blockchain to Battlefield
The trajectory of Lagrange from a cryptographic startup, likely rooted in the decentralized finance or Web3 sector, to a Raytheon vendor illustrates the increasing dual-use nature of privacy-preserving technologies. Zero-Knowledge proofs were originally popularized to scale blockchains like Ethereum. However, the underlying mathematics—proving knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself—maps perfectly to classified environments. The military needs to verify that allies or contractors are running the correct software without necessarily exposing the source code or the classified training data to every node in the network.
This “need-to-know” architecture is central to the Pentagon's Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) strategy. As disparate systems from the Air Force, Navy, and Army attempt to share data in real-time, the attack surface expands exponentially. Bloomberg Government analysis suggests that the next generation of defense contracts will favor vendors who can demonstrate “Zero Trust” architectures not just in network access, but in computational integrity. Lagrange's entry into the Raytheon ecosystem is a bellwether for this trend, suggesting that the future of defense contracting will require deep cryptographic competency.
Auditability as a Strategic Advantage
Beyond immediate security, the partnership addresses a looming regulatory hurdle: AI auditability. As the U.S. government moves toward regulating AI safety, defense agencies must ensure their autonomous systems adhere to the Laws of Armed Conflict. This requires an immutable audit trail of why an AI made a specific decision. Lagrange's technology facilitates this by generating verifiable proofs of the computation process. If a drone strikes a target, commanders can mathematically prove that the system was executing valid, authorized code at the moment of engagement, offering a layer of legal and ethical cover that is currently missing in black-box AI systems.
This capability serves as a significant differentiator for Raytheon in competitive bidding processes. While other contractors may offer higher performance or lower costs, the ability to offer “provable security” creates a moat around their offerings. In an era where cyber-warfare is constant, the assurance that a weapon system cannot be hacked to turn against its operators is a value proposition that commands a premium. The $30 billion market opportunity is not just about building better AI, but about building AI that the Pentagon can trust implicitly.
The Evolution of Defense Procurement
The integration of a niche cryptographic player into a massive defense conglomerate also highlights the evolving procurement strategies of the “Big Five” defense contractors. Historically, companies like Raytheon would attempt to build such capabilities in-house, a process that is often slow and costly. By acting as a platform integrator for specialized startups like Lagrange, Raytheon accelerates its time-to-market for secure AI solutions. This mirrors the commercial tech sector's approach, where giants like Microsoft or Google acquire or partner with specialized security firms to bolster their cloud offerings.
This shift is likely to spur further M&A activity and partnerships within the defense technology space. Startups specializing in homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, and other privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) are now viewing the Department of Defense not as a bureaucratic labyrinth, but as a viable, high-revenue customer. As TechCrunch has noted in its defense tech coverage, the “valley of death”—the gap between a pilot program and a program of record—is being bridged by these strategic partnerships with prime contractors who already hold the keys to the kingdom.
A New Standard for Algorithmic Warfare
Ultimately, the Raytheon-Lagrange alliance sets a precedent for the industry. It establishes that functional performance is no longer the sole metric for military AI; verification is now equally critical. As adversaries develop more sophisticated methods to spoof, jam, and subvert autonomous systems, the layer of protection provided by cryptographic proofs will transition from a luxury to a necessity. The “DeepProve” integration is an early indicator of a future where every algorithm deployed in a conflict zone will carry a cryptographic certificate of authenticity.

For the broader market, this signals that the intersection of cryptography and artificial intelligence is the next frontier for defense investment. The $30 billion earmarked for AI contracts is likely just the beginning, with a significant portion of future funding diverted specifically toward AI assurance and security. As the fog of war becomes increasingly digital, the ability to pierce that fog with mathematical certainty becomes the ultimate strategic asset.


Furthermore, this integration speaks to the rising threat of “data poisoning,” where adversaries subtly manipulate training data to create backdoors in AI models. A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) highlighted this as a top-tier threat to national security. DeepProve's architecture mitigates this by creating a cryptographic chain of custody for the model's evolution. If the weights of the neural network are altered by a byte, the proof fails, and the system can automatically revert to a safe mode or reject the command, providing a fail-safe that is mathematically guaranteed rather than just firewalled.

From Blockchain to Battlefield
The trajectory of Lagrange from a cryptographic startup, likely rooted in the decentralized finance or Web3 sector, to a Raytheon vendor illustrates the increasing dual-use nature of privacy-preserving technologies. Zero-Knowledge proofs were originally popularized to scale blockchains like Ethereum. However, the underlying mathematics—proving knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself—maps perfectly to classified environments. The military needs to verify that allies or contractors are running the correct software without necessarily exposing the source code or the classified training data to every node in the network.
This “need-to-know” architecture is central to the Pentagon's Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) strategy. As disparate systems from the Air Force, Navy, and Army attempt to share data in real-time, the attack surface expands exponentially. Bloomberg Government analysis suggests that the next generation of defense contracts will favor vendors who can demonstrate “Zero Trust” architectures not just in network access, but in computational integrity. Lagrange's entry into the Raytheon ecosystem is a bellwether for this trend, suggesting that the future of defense contracting will require deep cryptographic competency.
Auditability as a Strategic Advantage
Beyond immediate security, the partnership addresses a looming regulatory hurdle: AI auditability. As the U.S. government moves toward regulating AI safety, defense agencies must ensure their autonomous systems adhere to the Laws of Armed Conflict. This requires an immutable audit trail of why an AI made a specific decision. Lagrange's technology facilitates this by generating verifiable proofs of the computation process. If a drone strikes a target, commanders can mathematically prove that the system was executing valid, authorized code at the moment of engagement, offering a layer of legal and ethical cover that is currently missing in black-box AI systems.
This capability serves as a significant differentiator for Raytheon in competitive bidding processes. While other contractors may offer higher performance or lower costs, the ability to offer “provable security” creates a moat around their offerings. In an era where cyber-warfare is constant, the assurance that a weapon system cannot be hacked to turn against its operators is a value proposition that commands a premium. The $30 billion market opportunity is not just about building better AI, but about building AI that the Pentagon can trust implicitly.
The Evolution of Defense Procurement
The integration of a niche cryptographic player into a massive defense conglomerate also highlights the evolving procurement strategies of the “Big Five” defense contractors. Historically, companies like Raytheon would attempt to build such capabilities in-house, a process that is often slow and costly. By acting as a platform integrator for specialized startups like Lagrange, Raytheon accelerates its time-to-market for secure AI solutions. This mirrors the commercial tech sector's approach, where giants like Microsoft or Google acquire or partner with specialized security firms to bolster their cloud offerings.
This shift is likely to spur further M&A activity and partnerships within the defense technology space. Startups specializing in homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, and other privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) are now viewing the Department of Defense not as a bureaucratic labyrinth, but as a viable, high-revenue customer. As TechCrunch has noted in its defense tech coverage, the “valley of death”—the gap between a pilot program and a program of record—is being bridged by these strategic partnerships with prime contractors who already hold the keys to the kingdom.
A New Standard for Algorithmic Warfare
Ultimately, the Raytheon-Lagrange alliance sets a precedent for the industry. It establishes that functional performance is no longer the sole metric for military AI; verification is now equally critical. As adversaries develop more sophisticated methods to spoof, jam, and subvert autonomous systems, the layer of protection provided by cryptographic proofs will transition from a luxury to a necessity. The “DeepProve” integration is an early indicator of a future where every algorithm deployed in a conflict zone will carry a cryptographic certificate of authenticity.

Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum White Paper is often credited as one of the foundational texts of the modern cryptocurrency sector.

But according to Ethereum and Polkadot co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood, Buterin's original document required significant work before the blockchain design could be implemented.

When Buterin first published the Ethereum White Paper online  in early 2014, he was just 19 years old, and crypto was still characterized by a small community of Bitcoin enthusiasts.

The platform's original co-founders assembled more or less organically, with Wood joining specifically to help formalize Buterin's idea.

As he explained in an interview published on Wednesday, Nov. 26, the white paper was more of a “vision document.” 

However, “work needed to be done” to turn it into “an actual formal specification for the protocol.”

That work, which Wood undertook in the spring of 2014, led to the Ethereum Yellow Paper.

While Buterin conceived the vision for Ethereum and sketched its general outline, Wood's yellow paper provided the precise, mathematical details required for developers to build independent client implementations. 

It remains the authoritative technical reference for the Ethereum protocol today.

More than a decade after Ethereum launched, Wood and other co-founders have parted ways, leaving Buterin as its leading figurehead.

Wood and Charles Hoskinson both went off to found rival platforms, Polkadot and Cardano. 

But although they attempted to learn from Ethereum's early challenges to build more scalable blockchain networks, neither has ever surpassed the original smart contract platform in terms of adoption.

Despite technical advances, no Ethereum-killers ever materialized, and today, Buterin's vision document is considered a seminal piece of crypto history.

Oops, something went wrong

The long-standing rivalry between Conor McGregor and Khabib Nurmagomedov has resurfaced in an unexpected arena, igniting a controversy that blends personal history, digital collectibles, and renewed criticism over celebrity involvement in crypto projects.

What began as a jab from McGregor over Khabib's recent NFT drop has evolved into a wider debate involving blockchain investigator ZachXBT, who publicly accused the Irish fighter of hypocrisy over his own failed meme coin launch.

The dispute intensified on November 26 after McGregor accused Nurmagomedov of orchestrating a “multi-million dollar scam” tied to a Telegram-based NFT collection known as the “Papakha” drop.

The project featured 29,000 digital versions of the traditional Dagestani hat Khabib famously wore during his UFC walkouts, marketed as a cultural tribute to his late father, Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov.

The NFTs reportedly sold out in just 25 hours. Controversy followed when promotional posts disappeared from Khabib's Instagram and X pages, prompting McGregor to claim that fans were misled.

Nurmagomedov responded, insisting that the collection was legitimate and designed as an “exclusive digital gift” symbolizing Dagestani traditions.

He defended the distribution through Telegram and dismissed any claims of wrongdoing. The exchange revived tensions between the two athletes, but the debate escalated further when on-chain investigator ZachXBT entered the discussion.

Hours after McGregor's post, on-chain investigator ZachXBT reignited the controversy by turning McGregor's own criticisms against him.

ZachXBT reminded the public of McGregor's April 2025 meme coin, $REAL, which was offered in a sealed-bid auction with staking rewards for participants.

Despite the ambitious launch, the project raised only 39% of its targeted goal, prompting full refunds to investors.

ZachXBT's post questioned whether it was credible to label Khabib a scammer while McGregor himself had previously failed to deliver on a digital token project, effectively drawing parallels between the two fighters' crypto endeavors.

Both McGregor and Nurmagomedov have histories of controversial crypto ventures. Nurmagomedov faced criticism in 2023 for promoting a potentially fraudulent NFT in partnership with GoMining.

He also faced mixed reactions for promoting the Sharia-compliant finance platform Wahed.

Meanwhile, McGregor has had his own setbacks, including the 2022 McGregor Realm NFT project and the failed $REAL meme coin. These prior incidents have amplified the current dispute, as each fighter references the other's past failures to strengthen their narrative.

ZachXBT's participation in the McGregor–Khabib spat coincides with a broader surge in enforcement against undisclosed promotions.

Notably, in September, the investigator published documents revealing that more than 150 crypto influencers failed to label paid advertisements in token campaigns, raising concerns about market integrity.

Meme coins were among the hottest narratives and top-performing sectors in crypto in 2024. However, their rapid surge came to an abrupt halt in 2025 amid broader turbulence across the meme and NFT markets.

After peaking at $116.7 billion in early January, the sector collapsed to $39.4 billion in November, marking a 66% decline as several political and celebrity-backed launches rapidly lost value or were accused of misconduct.

The downturn was compounded by a sharp contraction in speculative appetite across NFTs and low-liquidity tokens.

While the meme coin market has shown brief signs of stabilization by recently rising to $46.64 billion with a 1.3% daily gain and a 24-hour trading volume of $5.05 billion, the sector remains far below its earlier highs.

The ongoing dispute between McGregor and Nurmagomedov shows the renewed scrutiny facing celebrity crypto promotions, especially at a time when failures, stalled presales, and alleged misrepresentations continue to attract attention.

Recent controversies have included the $433 million BlockDAG presale, which ZachXBT linked to an undisclosed founder, and the WEB3 token sale, which he tied to individuals associated with past NFT rug pulls.

How many people watched early crypto projects climb and then wished they took action at the right time instead of scrolling? Every cycle has those who hesitated and then saw life changing runs from the sidelines. Q4 2025 is shaping up the same way, and LivLive ($LIVE) is now entering the best crypto to buy under $1 spotlight.

LivLive ($LIVE) entered November with a powerful presale start that raised strong attention with a huge user focused model. The market also saw rising activity from names like Optimism (OP), where price action and news updates kept momentum flowing across the sector. These shifts set the stage for one of the most active buying seasons of the year.

Optimism (OP) launched with an ICO price many ignored. Some community members believed it would not survive strong competition. Yet OP took that small launch level and multiplied it many times, turning early positions into life changing outcomes. Those who got in early watched OP rise faster than anyone predicted.

People who doubted OP now look back wishing they joined when entries were low. OP's early cycle created stories of large returns for those who acted at the right moment. The crypto market keeps proving that missed chances always return in new forms. Q4 2025 is offering another major chance for new entries.

LivLive ($LIVE) is a global real world operating system that turns simple daily actions into digital rewards. Walking, checking in, shopping, or attending events creates XP, $LIVE tokens, and RWA bonuses. This gives daily life real value that early adopters can tap into across missions, wearables, quests, and social engagement.

LivLive merges AR, RWA integration, and real user activity into a gamified system that benefits buyers on multiple levels. Businesses gain verified engagement, while users gain tokens, XP, and real items. This creates a full value loop that strengthens demand for $LIVE over time.

• Pokémon GO style AR missions reward $LIVE tokens and NFTs• GPS verified actions ensure accurate participation• Flash drops, streak goals, and daily quests keep rewards active• RWA bonuses include merchandise, events, tickets, and more• AI powered personalization raises engagement for every user• Leaderboards add competition, ranks, and multipliers for better returns

Stage 1 of the LivLive ($LIVE) presale sold fast due to strong interest in its real world value approach.

Price growth is tied to rising demand. More users mean more missions, more quests, and more real life brands joining the system. This creates natural pressure on supply and gives early buyers an entry far below the expected launch level at $0.25.

LivLive unlocked a special Black Friday bonus code that boosts rewards for early adopters.

• Gives 300% extra $LIVE• Works instantly inside the presale• Limited time access• No other project offers this much token value in Q4 2025

This code gives a huge early boost before Stage 2 pricing rises. Early adopters who activate BLACK300 instantly start ahead of the next wave of buyers.

Join the presale now, activate BLACK300, and secure extra $LIVE before Stage 2 moves to higher levels.

The market saw OP rise from a doubted ICO to a major success. LivLive ($LIVE) is now building a similar path with a breakout presale, AR gameplay, RWA rewards, and a launch price far above today's entry. The LivLive presale is open with BLACK300 and a two sided Refer and Earn model for extra value. This opportunity stays active for a short time, and those who act now position themselves ahead of the next stage.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, has radically changed his stance towards the crypto industry: after years of skepticism, he now validates blockchain technology and stablecoins as essential tools for banking efficiency and profitability.

Those who have followed the market in recent years will have heard Dimon say that he didn't give a damn about Bitcoin and that if anyone was foolish enough to buy it, they would eventually pay the price. This aggressive rhetoric, which even included warnings about a potential price surge to $100.000 only to have it plummet to zero, long defined the ideological divide between traditional banking and digital finance. 

However, the landscape has changed dramatically. During the Mega Investment Summit held in Saudi Arabia, the executive offered a vision that contrasts sharply with his previous statements, marking a strategic shift at the largest financial institution in the United States.

The initial hostility, which practically labeled the sector a fraud destined to fail, has given way to a pragmatic recognition of the technology. Dimon no longer speaks from absolute contempt, but from operational evaluation. 

Although he remains a critic of Bitcoin, in his speech, the banker emphasized that Cryptographic technology is real and, above all, useful.This shift in narrative is significant coming from Dimon. The evolution of his discourse reflects a broader trend on Wall Street, where denial has been replaced by integration and the pursuit of efficiency through the digital channels that were once criticized.

The key distinction now being made by the JPMorgan CEO lies in separating speculative assets from technological infrastructure. While in 2017 his comments lumped the entire ecosystem together under a single label of risk, in 2025 his analysis is much more granular. 

Dimon has begun to clearly differentiate between the volatility of decentralized cryptocurrencies and the operational utility of blockchain technology and stablecoins. His recognition It focuses on the ability of these tools to solve historical banking problems, such as the speed of cross-border transactions and asset settlement.

For industry experts, this distinction is fundamental to understanding the bank's current strategy. By calling blockchain technology "real," Dimon validates what many in the industry already consider: Blockchain offers significant advantages over traditional accounting systemsThis recognition does not represent an ideological surrender to Bitcoin's decentralized philosophy, but rather a practical acceptance that this technology can optimize how financial value moves and is managed today.

The central argument for this new phase of JPMorgan is practical applicability. Dimon specifically highlighted the role of JPM CoinThe digital currency developed by the bank itself serves as a tangible example of this utility. Unlike public cryptocurrencies, whose value fluctuates based on market supply and demand, tools like JPM Coin and smart contracts are designed to execute specific functions with mathematical precision. The executive noted that these instruments are vital for asset transfers and improving profitability in trading, areas where traditional banking often faces friction due to intermediaries and waiting times.

The smart contractsThese self-executing codes, also mentioned by Dimon in his presentation, represent a significant advance in the automation of financial processes. They allow transactions to be executed and settled automatically when certain conditions are met, reducing human error and operating costs. 

Thus, Dimon's discourse moves away from the ideological debate surrounding cryptocurrencies and focuses on tangible business results. For an institution the size of JPMorgan, incorporating blockchain is not an ideological stance, but a clear strategy to optimize its balance sheets and profitability.

Finally, the mention of the stablecoins Stablecoins also reinforce this utilitarian view. These assets, designed to maintain parity with fiat currencies like the dollar, serve as the necessary bridge between the traditional and digital economies. By acknowledging their value, Dimon implicitly admits that the current payments system requires an urgent upgrade that only this technology can provide. 

Thus, the infrastructure that was once considered a threat to the banking business model has paradoxically become the tool that could ensure its survival and evolution in the next decade.

The bank is collaborating on this project with the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) and PwC, the organizations said in a Tuesday (Nov. 25) blog post.

“It's another way to move money on a blockchain, and we look at blockchain as an alternative payment rail, and we're very interested to see what use cases are going to manifest from that and what customers are most interested in,” Mike Villano, senior vice president, head of digital asset products at U.S. Bank, said in a video included with the post.

Villano said in the post that Stellar has protections that are needed for a project like this.

“For bank customers, we have to think about other protections around know your customers, the ability to unwind transactions, the ability to claw back transactions, and one of the great things about the Stellar platform as we did some more research and development on it was learning that they have the ability at their base operating layer to freeze assets and unwind transactions,” Villano said.

Stellar was designed to meet the needs of regulated institutions with things like 99.99% uptime over a decade, billions in annual payment volume, built-in asset controls and 3- to 5-second settlement, according to the post.

“When you are doing mission critical systems, when you are doing financial services, and you are moving customers' money, you need to make sure that your blockchain is going to be there,” José Fernández da Ponte, president and chief growth officer at SDF, said in the post. “So we are very honored to have the confidence of U.S. Bank and our partners at PwC.”

U.S. Bancorp CEO Gunjan Kedia said in October that the bank was looking to pilot stablecoin transactions this year through partnerships.

When it comes to stablecoins as a payment rail, the bank's efforts are twofold, Kedia said.

“One is to just be ready to onboard and offboard a stablecoin into the banking system, and we are working on that in conjunction with the industry consortiums,” Kedia said Oct. 16 during an earnings call. “And then the second is just being ready to provide stablecoin services as a payment vehicle should that market take off within our client base.”

A day earlier, on Oct. 15, U.S. Bank announced that it had established an organization that will focus on emerging digital products and services like stablecoin issuance, cryptocurrency custody, asset tokenization and digital money movement.

What can researchers do if they suspect that their manuscripts have been peer reviewed using artificial intelligence (AI)? Dozens of academics have raised concerns on social media about manuscripts and peer reviews submitted to the organizers of next year's International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), an annual gathering of specialists in machine learning. Among other things, they flagged hallucinated citations and suspiciously long and vague feedback on their work.

Graham Neubig, an AI researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was one of those who received peer reviews that seemed to have been produced using large language models (LLMs). The reports, he says, were “very verbose with lots of bullet points” and requested analyses that were not “the standard statistical analyses that reviewers ask for in typical AI or machine-learning papers.”

But Neubig needed help proving that the reports were AI-generated. So, he posted on X (formerly Twitter) and offered a reward for anyone who could scan all the conference submissions and their peer reviews for AI-generated text. The next day, he got a response from Max Spero, chief executive of Pangram Labs in New York City, which develops tools to detect AI-generated text. Pangram screened all 19,490 studies and 75,800 peer reviews submitted for ICLR 2026, which will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in April. Neubig and more than 11,000 other AI researchers will be attending.

Pangram's analysis revealed that around 21% of the ICLR peer reviews were fully AI-generated, and more than half contained signs of AI use. The findings were posted online by Pangram Labs. “People were suspicious, but they didn't have any concrete proof,” says Spero. “Over the course of 12 hours, we wrote some code to parse out all of the text content from these paper submissions,” he adds. 

The conference organizers say they will now use automated tools to assess whether submissions and peer reviews breached policies on using AI in submissions and peer reviews. This is the first time that the conference has faced this issue at scale, says Bharath Hariharan, a computer scientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and senior programme chair for ICLR 2026. “After we go through all this process … that will give us a better notion of trust.” 

The Pangram team used one of its own tools, which predicts whether text is generated or edited by LLMs. Pangram's analysis flagged 15,899 peer reviews that were fully AI-generated. But it also identified many manuscripts that had been submitted to the conference with suspected cases of AI-generated text: 199 manuscripts (1%) were found to be fully AI-generated; 61% of submissions were mostly human-written; but 9% contained more than 50% AI-generated text. 

Pangram described the model in a preprint1, which it submitted to ICLR 2026. Of the four peer reviews received for the manuscript, one was flagged as fully AI-generated and another as lightly AI-edited, the team's analysis found.

For many researchers who received peer reviews for their submissions to ICLR, the Pangram analysis confirmed what they had suspected. Desmond Elliott, a computer scientist at the University of Copenhagen, says that one of three reviews he received seemed to have missed “the point of the paper”. His PhD student who led the work suspected that the review was generated by LLMs, because it mentioned numerical results from the manuscript that were incorrect and contained odd expressions. 

When Pangram released its findings, Elliott adds, “the first thing I did was I typed in the title of our paper because I wanted to know whether my student's gut instinct was correct”. The suspect peer review, which Pangram's analysis flagged as fully AI-generated, gave the manuscript the lowest rating, leaving it “on the borderline between accept and reject”, says Elliott. “It's deeply frustrating”.

Many RNAs rely on their 3D structures for function. While acquiring functional 3D structures, certain RNAs form misfolded, non-functional states (‘kinetic traps'). Instead, other RNAs sequentially assemble into their functional conformations over pre-folded scaffolds. Elucidating the principles of RNA sequential assembly is thus important to understand how RNAs avoid the formation of misfolded, non-functional states. Integrating single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM), image processing, in solution small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), EM-driven molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, structure-based mutagenesis, and enzymatic assays, we have visualized the sequential multidomain assembly of a self-splicing ribozyme of biomedical and bioengineering significance. Our work reveals a distinct dynamic interplay of helical subdomains in the ribozyme's 5'-terminal scaffold, which acts as a gate to control the docking of 3'-terminal domains. We identify specific conserved and functionally important secondary structure motifs as the key players for orchestrating the energetically inexpensive conformational changes that lead to the productive formation of the catalytic pocket. Our work provides a near-atomic resolution molecular movie of a large multidomain RNA assembling into its functionally active conformation and establishes a basis for understanding how RNA avoids the formation of non-functional ‘kinetic traps'.

RNA catalyzes vital biochemical reactions, such as splicing or protein synthesis, and regulates gene expression and metabolic adaptation to the environment, with important implications for human health1,2,3,4. To enable such fundamental processes, RNA molecules often need to assemble into functional three-dimensional (3D) structures by exploring complex conformational landscapes5,6. RNA structural assembly can occur via two main pathways7, known as the ‘kinetic trap' and the ‘sequential' folding pathways.

Frequently, RNA folding involves the formation of stable misfolded states, i.e., so-called ‘kinetic traps', which are functionally unproductive8,9,10,11. For instance, tRNAs form misfolded states that cannot be recognized by their cognate aminoacyl transferases unless denatured and refolded12,13. Ribosomal RNAs form alternative stable conformations with different abilities to bind ribosomal proteins and thus reconstitute a functional ribosome14. The M1 catalytic subunit of Escherichia coli ribonuclease P forms a transiently inactive conformation that needs to refold before it can catalyze its reaction15. Finally, certain hammerhead ribozymes form kinetically-trapped conformations that have low catalytic efficiency16. Mechanistically, the process of kinetic trap formation is best studied in group I introns, which are self-splicing ribozymes that fold, generating a variety of misfolded species7. The structural basis for the formation of ‘kinetic traps' in these model systems has been recently elucidated thanks to the determination of a number of cryo-EM structures of the Tetrahymena group I intron in the catalytically active and in misfolded states9,17,18,19,20.

In some cases, though, RNAs are able to fold sequentially into their functional structures, without forming ‘kinetic traps'. These latter RNAs crucially form stable, well-folded core scaffolds that guide the sequential docking of peripheral RNA domains. Elucidating how RNAs can mechanistically avoid the formation of ‘kinetic traps' would open new avenues for deriving quantitative models for predicting RNA structures and RNA thermodynamic behaviors, with important impacts on RNA engineering and related technological developments. However, to date, we still lack a direct visualization and a mechanistic model of how RNAs can assemble sequentially, avoiding misfolded, non-functional states8,9.

The prototypical systems used to study sequential RNA assembly are group II introns, another class of highly-conserved self-splicing ribozymes of biomedical and bioengineering relevance21. Group II introns are validated drug targets for antifungal antibiotics, potentially powerful vectors for genetic engineering, and the evolutionary ancestors of the catalytic RNA core of the eukaryotic spliceosome22,23. Notably, from biochemical work on the yeast ai5γ group II intron from Saccharomyces (S.) cerevisiae, it is well established that the 5'-terminal domain 1 (D1, ~300 nucleotide length, ~90 kDa) first folds autonomously into a stable scaffold. Then, folding of D1 is followed by the assembly of 3'-terminal domains (D2-D5), without generating kinetic traps, to eventually form highly-conserved tertiary interactions that stabilize the catalytically-active structure, formed by domains D1-524,25,26,27. Although mechanistically unclear, this assembly process is highly conserved in evolution, throughout all classes of group II introns28.

The crystal structure of D1 from the bacterial I1 group II intron of Oceanobacillus (O.) iheyensis confirmed the formation of the D1 assembly scaffold as the first step for intron folding28. Nevertheless, comparison of the D1 structure with structures of D1-5 at various catalytic stages29,30 revealed that in isolation D1 adopts a “closed” conformation unable to accommodate in its core the active site motifs, provided by D2-D528. This observation raises the question of how D1 opens its core without acting as a ‘kinetic trap', and how it adopts its “catalytic” conformation in the full-length functionally active ribozyme, guided by the assembly of D2-D5. The mechanism regulating the conformational changes of D1, the energetics of this transition, and the hierarchy by which D2-D5 dock on D1 still remain unknown.

Here, to shed light on the molecular mechanism of group II intron assembly, we have set out to visualize the D1 dynamics in the presence of D2, D2 and D3, and D2, D3, and D4, respectively. We have integrated electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM), single-particle image analysis, in-solution small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our data reveal conformational dynamics of conserved D1 hinge residues, which were not apparent from the existing crystal structures of the group II intron ribozyme. These hinge residues emerge as the structural determinants that enable group II intron assembly by acting as a gate to regulate the energetically inexpensive formation of the active site. Our proposed ‘dynamic gating' mechanism is evolutionarily conserved across group II introns, because structure-based mutagenesis aimed to rigidify the D1 hinge residues causes severe catalytic defects on homologous bacterial and yeast introns. Our mechanism thus sets a paradigm to understand how large multi-domain RNAs assemble, avoiding non-functional ‘kinetic traps'.

To understand the mechanism by which the group II intron domain D1 transitions between its “closed” and its “catalytic” conformations, we first set out to identify the critical structural differences between these two states by comparing the corresponding crystal structures. We have compared PDB id 4Y1O (isolated D1 in the “closed” state) and PDB id 4FAQ (D1-5 intron immediately preceding the first step of splicing, where D1 is in the “catalytic” state)28,29. Comparison of pseudo-torsional angles of D1 residues in these two structures had previously identified two hinge motifs, formed by residues 71–73 and 115–116 (hinge 1) and residues 217 and 223–224 (hinge 2), respectively, as the control hubs regulating D1 dynamics28 (Fig. 1A).

Secondary structure elements of D1 described in the text are depicted with respective labels and colors corresponding to all subsequent subpanels. Tertiary interactions and active site motifs are depicted in Roman letters. B Same map highlighting key RNA helices and geometric descriptors used in the text, i.e., ‘angles A-D' and ‘gate distance'. C D1 crystal structure (PDB id 4Y1O) in which each subdomain discussed in the text is represented with a distinctive color, as in panel A. The position of the hinge 1 and 2 residues is indicated. D Same structure as in (C), where the helical axes of ‘core D1c' (orange) and D1d1 (violet), used to calculate ‘angle A', are indicated by the black lines. E Same structure as in (C), where the helical axes of ‘core D1c' (orange), ‘peripheral D1c' (light green) and i1-i2 (dark green), used to calculate ‘angle B' and ‘angle C', respectively, are indicated by the black lines. F Same structure as in (C), where the helical axes of D1d1 (violet) and i1-i2 (dark green), used to calculate ‘angle D', are indicated by the black lines. G Superposition of “closed” D1 (PDB id 4Y1O, colored as in panel C) and “catalytic” D1 (PDB id 4FAQ, light yellow). H Same representation as in (G), rotated by 90° with respect to the right subpanel G, and showing here the steric clash between the “closed” D1 structure and D5. I) Zoom into the hinge 1 residues from “closed” D1 (PDB id 4Y1O, orange) and “catalytic” D1 (PDB id 4FAQ, light yellow). J Highlight into the steric clash (red label) between A72 (orange, “closed” state) and nucleotides of the Z-anchor motif (yellow, “catalytic open” state). Z-anchor nucleotides are flexible in the “closed” state. In this latter state, the first nucleotides flanking the Z-anchor and visible in the structure are C102 (light green) and G108 (grey).

Through closer inspection of pairwise phosphate atom distances, here we have quantified the magnitude of structural displacement of each residue between the “closed” and “catalytic” states. We superposed “closed” D1 over “catalytic” D1 by performing an all-atom alignment and then calculating pairwise phosphate distances between analogous phosphate atoms in the two structures, in PyMOL (v 1.8.0.4, Schrodinger LLC). The least structurally-displaced residues correspond to nucleotides 124–133 and 230–242 forming the so-called D1d1 subdomain (see the group II intron secondary structure map in Fig. 1A). By contrast, the most structurally-displaced residues correspond to nucleotides 6–23 and 250–267 in i1-i2 and to nucleotides 76–111 in D1c, around hinge 1 (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. 1A, B). At this location, we have further observed that residues A72 and C116 in hinge 1 change conformation around the phosphate-ribose backbone between the two states. In the “closed” state, the nucleobases of A72 and C116 bulge outwards with respect to the helical axis of D1c. By contrast, in the “catalytic” state, these nucleobases are oriented towards the center of the helix (Fig. 1I). Importantly, in the bulged-out conformation, A72 displays a steric clash with the so-called Z-anchor and λ motifs, inducing them to be unstructured in the “closed” state (Fig. 1J). These unstructured residues define a boundary between two subdomains of D1c. The D1c subdomain closer to the D1 core (hereafter ‘core D1c') encompasses residues 66–75 and 112–121, while the more peripheral subdomain (hereafter ‘peripheral D1c') encompasses residues 80–102 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The relative position of ‘core D1c' and ‘peripheral D1c', and their orientation with respect to neighboring subdomains i1-i2 and D1d1 crucially determine the overall geometry of the D1 scaffold and the accessibility of its inner cavity to active site nucleotides.

To quantitatively describe the geometry of the D1 scaffold and in line with previous literature discussing conformational changes in biological macromolecules31,32,33, we have defined the following specific descriptors. ‘Angles A-D' are the angles between the helical axes of ‘core D1c' and D1d1, ‘core D1c' and ‘peripheral D1c', ‘core D1c' and i1-i2, and D1d1 and i1-i2, respectively. ‘Gate distance' is the interatomic distance between the C1' atoms of two residues (G75 and U238) in D1 and serves as a measurement for the size of the D1 pocket (Fig. 1B–F and Supplementary Table 1). We have then monitored how these angles and distances vary between the “closed” and “catalytic” states of D1. Our analysis shows that in the “closed” state ‘core D1c' is closer to D1d1 than in the “catalytic” state, while ‘peripheral D1c' displaces the laterally stacked i1-i2 helix. As a consequence, in the “closed” state, the i1-i2 helix occupies a position that would clash with D5 residues in the “catalytic” state, creating a steric hindrance that prevents the “closed” D1 from accommodating D5 into the active site pocket (Fig. 1G, H, and Supplementary Movie 1).

To experimentally characterize the absolutely required transition of D1 between its “closed” and its “catalytic” state, we have first studied the behavior of D1 in solution. We have produced and purified D1 by in vitro transcription followed by our previously described non-denaturing RNA purification protocol [see Materials and Methods and refs. 28,34]. We have obtained a pure and homogeneous preparation of D1 as judged by agarose gel electrophoresis, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and mass photometry (MP, Supplementary Fig. 2). Size-exclusion chromatography coupled to SAXS (SEC-SAXS) further confirmed that purified D1 in solution has dimensions and a conformation similar to the ones captured by its crystal structure (PDB id 4Y1O, Χ2crysol = 1.77, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables 2, 3). To characterize the dynamics of D1 and the bulged-in vs bulged-out conformations of nucleotides A72 and C116 between the “catalytic” and “closed” state, we have then performed SAXS-driven metainference metadynamics simulations. The MD-generated conformational ensemble of D1 agrees with the experimental hydrodynamic behavior of D1 determined by SEC-SAXS (Χ2MD = 1.62 ± 0.42, Supplementary Fig. 4). Our simulations also estimated that the Gibbs free energy required to exchange between the bulged-in and bulged-out conformations of A72 and C116 is ~10 kcal•mol-1, which is in line with similar conformational changes observed previously for catalytic intermediates of the same ribozyme30 and much smaller than conformational transitions required to refold kinetically trapped RNA conformers14,15,16. Most importantly, simulations show that the conformation of A72 and C116 strongly affects the structural dynamics of D1. When A72 and C116 are bulged-in, D1 is flexible and explores two metastable conformations in one main free-energy basin corresponding to the “catalytic” state (Fig. 2A, states 1 and 2, Χ2 = 1.09 and Χ2 = 1.83, respectively). Instead, when both A72 and C116 are bulged out of the D1c helix, D1 only explores “closed” conformations (Fig. 2A, state 3, Χ2 = 1.93).

B Free energy surface estimated with SAXS-driven metainference metadynamics simulations for D1-2 (coordinates extracted from PDB id 4FAQ). In both panels, the free energy surface is reported as a contour plot every 2 kcal•mol−1. The x-axes report the distance of the simulated system from the A72 and C116 bulged in/out conformations, which are shown as 2D structures below the axes. The y-axes report the Rg of D1. Reference “catalytic” and “closed” states are represented as a star and a square, respectively.

Then, we analyzed how the metastable states observed during D1 dynamics differ in terms of the critical structural angles and distances that define the position of the D1 helices (‘angles A-D' and ‘gate distance', see previous paragraph, Supplementary Fig. 4). From state 1 to state 3, both ‘angle A' and ‘angle D' gradually decrease. This observation suggests that the dynamics of both ‘core D1c' and i1-i2 contribute to the opening and closing of the D1 core, as shown also by the progressive narrowing of the ‘gate distance' from state 1 to state 3. Furthermore, ‘angle B' gradually increases, revealing a change in the angular orientation of the ‘peripheral D1c' helix with respect to the ‘core D1c' helix (Supplementary Fig. 4).

In summary, in isolation, the D1 scaffold is stabilized in the “closed” conformation, as captured by the corresponding crystal structure, because A72 and C116 in hinge 1 adopt a bulged-out state, which positions ‘peripheral D1c' and i1-i2 in an orientation that closes the D1 core.

Interestingly, in the “closed” state, ‘peripheral D1c' is located in the space that is occupied by D2 in the “catalytic” state (Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, we went ahead to determine whether the addition of D2 to D1 could facilitate the transition from the “closed” to the “catalytic” state.

Using the same non-denaturing purification protocol as for D128,34, we obtained pure, folded, and homogeneous preparations of D1-2, as confirmed by gel electrophoresis, SEC, MP, and SEC-SAXS (Supplementary Fig. 2, 3 and Supplementary Tables 2, 3). Then, we used the experimental scattering data to perform SAXS-driven metainference metadynamics simulations (using a model structure of D1-D2, extracted from the structure of the “catalytic” state, i.e., PDB id: 4FAQ). These simulations agreed with the properties of D1-2 experimentally observed in solution by SEC-SAXS (Χ2MD = 1.70 ± 0.46, Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Tables 2, 3), and estimated a free energy barrier of ~12 kcal•mol-1 between the bulged-in and bulged-out conformations of hinge 1, similar to the barrier we observed when simulating D1 in isolation (see above). Importantly, simulations showed that the inclusion of D2 still allows D1 to explore three metastable states, but with an altered conformational landscape suggesting that D2 modifies the structural dynamics of D1. Indeed, in the presence of D2, when A72 and C116 are bulged-out, D1 only samples the “closed” state, as for D1 in isolation (state 3, Χ2 = 2.20, Fig. 2B). But when A72 and C116 are bulged-in, D1 samples both the “catalytic” state (state 2, Χ2 = 1.23) and a distinct state with larger Rg that is not sampled by D1 in isolation (state 1, Χ2 = 1.67, Fig. 2B). These dynamics are quantitatively described by the D1 descriptors, ‘angles A-D' and ‘gate distance' (Supplementary Fig. 4).

In summary, our SAXS-driven MD simulations suggest that D2 is both required and sufficient to induce D1 to sample “open” states, not explored by D1 in isolation.

To validate the mechanistic hypothesis suggested by SAXS-driven MD simulations and visualize the putative D1 state characterized by larger Rg values, we set out to experimentally determine the 3D structure of D1-2 using cryo-EM. To obtain a complete picture of the multi-domain assembly mechanism of group II introns, we also determined the cryo-EM structures of D1-3 and D1-4, which we could purify using analogous non-denaturing purification protocols28,34, to the same degree of purity and homogeneity as D1 and D1-2 (Supplementary Fig. 2). All these assembly intermediates are catalytically inactive as they lack the active site residues contributed by D521.

Through SAXS studies, we first confirmed that all constructs are homogenous in solution and suitable for cryo-EM grid vitrification (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables 2, 3). Vitrified grids displayed sufficiently homogenous particle distribution and particles density on the micrographs to enable particle picking, although a tendency to form more aggregates and sparser particles was observed for the larger constructs (Supplementary Figs. 5–7).

Through 3D reconstruction of 300,000-600,000 particles for each data set in CryoSPARC35,36,37, we obtained Coulomb potential maps at ~4 Å resolution for D1-2 and D1-3, enabling us to distinguish the major and minor groves of the RNA helices, and at ~7 Å resolution for D1-4, likely correlating to the inherent flexibility of this construct (Fig. 3). These datasets enabled us to properly orient the D1 coordinates into all resulting maps and to identify the D1 subdomains, using the available D1 crystal structures as reference models (Supplementary Figs. 5–7).

F Density of the “fully open” state of D1-4 at 6.67 Å resolution. In all panels, thick lines represent the helical axes of ‘core D1c' (orange), ‘peripheral D1c' (light green), and i1-i2 (dark green), respectively. The expected position of D2 and D3 is indicated with a black dashed encircled region.

Importantly, subsequent 3D classification yielded two distinct cryo-EM maps for each construct, which differ in the relative orientation of the ‘core D1c' and the i1-i2 helices (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, in these constructs, D1 never forms the “closed” or the “catalytic” conformations, but rather adopts two distinct conformations (see values of ‘angles A-D' and ‘gate distance' in Supplementary Table 1). One conformation, hereafter referred to as the “partly open” state, displays a distinct orientation of ‘peripheral D1c', which differs clearly from the “catalytic” state despite laterally flanking i1-i2 and D2 (Supplementary Fig. 8). The other conformation, hereafter referred to as the “fully open” state, displays an even larger separation between D1c and i1-i2, a weak density for the ‘peripheral D1c' motif, and disordered Z-anchor and θ nucleotides, which engage in tertiary contacts between D1 and D2 (Supplementary Fig. 8).

In summary, our cryo-EM data revealed that in the presence of 3'-terminal domains, D1 adopts previously uncharacterized conformations characterized by distinct orientations of RNA helices. These conformations originate from the relative displacement of the two D1 helical subdomains, D1c and i1-i2.

To better characterize the conformational space sampled by D1 in the presence of 3'-terminal domains, we have employed 3D variability (3DVA) classification on the particles extracted from the D1-2, D1-3, and D1-4 datasets (Supplementary Fig. 9). We have generated 20 sub-states for each construct. Based on the angular orientation of the D1c and i1-i2 helices, we defined sub-state 1 as the state corresponding to the “partly open” state, and sub-state 20 as the state corresponding to the “fully open” state.

We then refined the structural coordinates of D1 into each of the 3DVA sub-states for the D1-2 and D1-3 datasets. We obtained models characterized by accurate geometry and fit to the respective cryo-EM maps, although some peripheral nucleotides in each construct are structured only in certain, but not all sub-states (Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. 10–12). For the D1-4 dataset, we could not obtain a resolution better than 5 Å from 3DVA. Thus, despite unequivocally observing a progressive separation between D1c and i1-i2 helices from sub-states 1 to 20, we could not visualize further structural details with sufficient confidence for this construct (Supplementary Fig. 7).

Notably, the resulting 3DVA conformational ensembles of D1-2 and D1-3 fit the respective SAXS scattering curves with an improved Χ2 value compared to the fits obtained using the crystal structures of D1 or the MD computational ensembles (Χ23DVA = 1.26 for D1-2, and Χ23DVA = 1.04 for D1-3, Supplementary Tables 2, 3). We then selected three parameters to describe the conformation of D1 in each sub-state, namely the pairwise root mean square deviation (RMSD) value of the models, and the previously-defined ‘angle A' and ‘gate distance'. For reference, the RMSD between the “closed” and “catalytic” conformations of D1 is 2.4 Å. Moreover, in the “closed” conformation of D1 (PDB id 4Y1O), ‘angle A' = 62.9° and ‘gate distance' = 32.0 Å, while in the “catalytic” conformation of D1 (PDB id 4FAQ), ‘angle A' = 57° and ‘gate distance' = 34.0 Å.

The pairwise RMSD value ranged between 0.1 to 1.2 Å for the 20 sub-states of D1-2, and between 0.1 to 0.5 Å for the 20 sub-states of D1-3 (Fig. 4A, B). These values suggest that D1-3 undergoes less pronounced conformational dynamics compared to D1-2. Furthermore, ‘angle A' progressively increases from 65.8° for sub-state model 1 to 80.5° for sub-state model 20 for the D1-2 dataset, and from 66.9° for sub-state model 1 to 75.1° for sub-state model 20 for the D1-3 dataset, respectively (Fig. 4C). Finally, the ‘gate distance' progressively increases from 33.8 Å for sub-state model 1 to 37.8 Å for sub-state model 20 for the D1-2 dataset, and from 34.6 Å for sub-state model 1 to 36.5 Å for sub-state model 20 for the D1-3 dataset, respectively (Fig. 4D). These displacements correspond to movements at the tip of helices D1c and D1d1 of 51.2 Å (Figs. 5, 6).

In summary, 3DVA analysis confirms the observations made during heterogeneous-refinement 3D classification. In the presence of 3'-terminal domains, the D1 conformation is significantly different from the “closed” state adopted by D1 in isolation. Indeed, in these constructs, D1 explores a range of previously-unobserved conformations that continuously connect the “partly open” (sub-state 1) to the “fully open” state (sub-state 20). Moreover, 3DVA analysis showed that the D1-3 construct is characterized by less-pronounced conformational changes with respect to D1-2, due to reduced angular motion of the ‘core D1c' helix.

Establishing that D2, D3, and D4 affect the D1 dynamics and induce the opening of its core to prepare for harboring the active site residues, we then sought to understand how these 3'-terminal domains dock onto D1.

In the D1-2 dataset, we can observe complete density for D2 in the “partly open” state, but not in the “fully open” state. More precisely, D2 density is visible in 3DVA sub-states 1 to 6, while in states 7-20 the θ-θ' tertiary interaction is broken and D2 becomes structurally disordered, along with ‘peripheral D1c' (Fig. 5A).

Analogously, in the D1-3 dataset, we can observe density for D2 in the “partly open”, but not in the “fully open” states. Moreover, we cannot observe density for D3 in either of the two states. Curiously, despite being disordered, D3 does have an impact on the D1 conformational dynamics, as observed in our 3DVA analysis (see above). More precisely, D2 density is visible in 3DVA sub-states 1 to 8, while from sub-state 9 to 20, density corresponding to i2, D2, and ‘peripheral D1c' gradually disappears (Fig. 5B).

Finally, in the D1-4 dataset, we can observe density for D2 and D3, but not for D4, in the “partly open” state (Fig. 3E).

In summary, these structural data suggest that D2, D3, and D4 dock one after the other onto D1, depicting the following sequence of events for the multi-domain assembly of group II introns. Steric clashes occurring between the D1 scaffold (specifically, the ‘peripheral D1c' motif) and D2, the domain that is transcribed immediately after the scaffold, trigger the opening of D1. However, D2 is not stably bound to D1 in this state, but only transiently docks onto D1 by establishing the θ-θ' interaction in the ‘partly open' state. Subsequently, each domain sequentially docks onto D1, but only if the preceding domains are already docked and only in the presence of the following domain. For instance, in the D1-3 state, D2 is stably docked onto D1, but not D3. D3 only docks onto D1 in the D1-4 constructs, where however, D4 remains flexible and does not establish tertiary interactions with the rest of the molecule (Figs. 3–5 and Supplementary Table 1). Surprisingly, though, this sequential multi-domain assembly process is not accomplished through the opening of the D1 pocket from the “closed” conformation progressively to the “catalytic” conformation. Instead, D1 first transits from its “closed” state into “open” states, characterized by a pocket much wider than the “catalytic” state. These “open” states are in equilibrium between two extreme conformations, the “partly” and the “fully” open states. D1 closes back into its “catalytic” state only upon D5 docking, positioning all domains in place for catalysis.

Established that D2, D3, and D4 affect D1 dynamics and sequentially dock onto this scaffold domain, we then investigated the molecular bases for the opening of D1.

To obtain detailed molecular insights into the D1 dynamics in the presence of the 3'-terminal domains, we have employed a pipeline that iteratively combines highly-selective particle exclusion and CryoSPARC 3D reconstruction, followed up by angular refinement. By selectively excluding low-resolution particles, we increased the proportion of high-quality particles and drastically reduced the number of particles per class, allowing us to obtain highly-resolved maps for the two herein identified “partly open” and “fully open” states of D1-2 and D1-3, respectively (Table 1).

We then reconstructed the models of the “partly open” and “fully open” states of D1-2 and D1-3 (Fig. 6). These models matched those obtained from heterogeneous refinement in CryoSPARC and from the 3DVA analysis, as judged by the D1 geometry (‘angle A', ‘gate distance', Supplementary Table 1). Importantly, the most highly-resolved maps show that, in the “partly open” conformation of both D1-2 and D1-3, hinge 1 residue A72 orients towards the core of the D1c helix, as in the “catalytic” state, but C116 bulges out of the helix, as in the “closed” state, and its solvent-exposed nucleobase remains disordered (Fig. 6A, B). In the “fully open” state of D1-3, though, both A72 and C116 orients towards the core of the D1c helix, as in the “catalytic” state (Fig. 6C, D). Hinge 2 residues (A217 and A223-A224), instead, do not show major conformational changes between the two states in either construct. Finally, the ζ and κ nucleotides remain flexible and displaced in both states of both constructs, as observed in the heterogeneous refinement and 3DVA models, and in agreement with the previously proposed induced-fit mechanism for the formation of these long-range tertiary interactions (Supplementary Fig. 13).

Next, we conducted multiple walker well-tempered metadynamics (MW-MetaD) simulations using the cryo-EM coordinates of both the “partly open” and the “fully open” states of D1-3 as starting models, to sample the conformational space and identify the lowest energy pathway connecting the cryo-EM models (Fig. 7, see also the description of the structural models used for MD simulations in the Materials and Methods section). Mechanistically, these simulations revealed that the interaction between the tertiary Z-anchor motif and the residues in the i1-i2 segment appears to play a key role for the transition. In the “partly open” conformation, the tertiary Z-anchor motif is stabilized by stacking interactions between A12 and A110 and between G108 and C262, respectively. Hydrogen bond interactions are formed and maintained between A110 and U259 and between C11 and G108, respectively (Fig. 7C). For the transition from “partly open” to “fully open” to occur, this network of molecular interactions needs to change to generate an “intermediate” state. In this “intermediate” state, residue U13 plays a crucial role by replacing residue A12, forming a stacking interaction with A110 (Fig. 7C). During this transition, the Z-anchor nucleotides makes fewer interactions with the i1-i2 segment, but more local interactions with other D1c residues. Specifically, within the Z-anchor motif, residues G108 and A110 now form stacking interactions. Finally, in the “fully open” structure, the stacking interaction between U13 and A110 is maintained. In summary, despite rearranging intramolecular interactions, the energetic cost for D1 to transit between “partly open” and “fully open” conformations is minimal, explaining the continuum equilibrium of “open” states that we experimentally captured by cryo-EM.

C Cartoon representation of the molecular structure of the Z-anchor (grey) and i1-i2 (green) for the “partly open”, “intermediate”, and “fully open” states.

More quantitatively, from our free energy surface (FES) estimation, the “partly open” state is the deepest energy minimum, ~2 kcal•mol−1 lower in energy than the “fully open” state, passing through a metastable “intermediate” state, ~4 kcal•mol−1 higher than the “partly open”. Notably, conformational transitions between such minima are separated by activation barriers of 6–8 kcal•mol−1 from “partly open” to “intermediate” and 8–10 kcal•mol−1 from “fully open” to “intermediate”, similar in magnitude to the transitions observed in the D1 and D1-2 simulations (see above and Fig. 7A). The fact that these energy barriers are nearly equivalent explains why all minima are observed during our enhanced sampling simulations. These barrier heights are consistent with our observation of a continuum of intermediate conformations, including the “partly open” and “fully open” principal states, observed during cryo-EM cooling38, as identified by the 3DVA analysis.

In summary, the energy landscape features distinct basins that are connected by accessible pathways, enabling D1 to sample a wide range of dynamic “open” conformations when D2, D3, and D4 are present. These results point to a finely orchestrated conformational change of key conserved residues in and around hinge 1, which directly correlates with the orientation of the ‘core D1c', ‘peripheral D1c' and i1-i2 helices, and thus with the size and shape of the D1 pocket that has to prepare for accommodating the active site residues.

Establishing how hinge 1 residues mechanistically control the D1 dynamics, and thus the assembly of the group II intron structure into its functionally active conformation, we set out to determine if hinge 1 mutations have an impact on catalysis. In the past, hinge 1 had already been identified as a control hub for group II intron compaction, but in the absence of structural data, mutations designed to change the sequence of this motif could not identify functional defects39. Here, we revisited those earlier studies in light of our structural data and specifically hypothesized that the structural dynamics of hinge 1, rather than the sequence identity of hinge 1 residues, are important to control group II intron assembly (Fig. 8).

First, we mutated the O. iheyensis I1 intron to reduce the dynamics of hinge 1 by locking into Watson-Crick base pairs the 5'- and the 3'-sides of this internal loop (residues 71–73 and 114–116, respectively). Splicing kinetics reveal that the mutant performs the first step of splicing 6-fold slower than the wild type (k1-pOiA = 0.016 ± 0.003 min−1; k1-pOiA-hinge1mut = 0.003 ± 0.000 min−1) and the second step of splicing 2-fold slower than the wild type (k2-pOiA = 0.041 ± 0.007 min−1; k2-pOiA-hinge1mut = 0.028 ± 0.005 min−1, Fig. 8A, B and Supplementary Table 4).

Second, to probe the evolutionary sequence, structural and functional conservation of hinge 1, we introduced homologous mutations also in the yeast ai5γ group II intron. We detected equally severe functional defects. Specifically, the mutant (ai5γ-D135-hinge1mut) has a vmax = 0.75 ± 0.06 nmol•L-1•min−1, corresponding to 3 % of the vmax of wild-type (ai5γ-D135, vmax = 22.47 ± 9.49 nmol•L-1•min−1), and a KM = 7.87 ± 3.24 nmol•L−1, corresponding to 4 % of the KM of wild-type (KM = 192.67 ± 80.93 nmol•L−1, Fig. 8D, E and Supplementary Table 4).

In summary, our systematic structural characterization of group II introns assembly enabled us to identify specific, conserved residues that allosterically control catalysis by regulating the folding dynamics of this ribozyme. The second step splicing defect of the O. iheyensis intron mutant further suggests that these dynamics also control previously described conformational rearrangements that need to occur during catalysis, between the first and the second steps of splicing23,30.

In this work, we have visualized the multidomain assembly pathway of a large non-coding RNA of biomedical and bioengineering significance, the group II self-splicing intron, in the process of forming a catalytically active tertiary structure. The distinctive property of our target is its ability to position peripheral domains onto a pre-assembled structural scaffold without forming inactive, misfolded states (‘kinetic traps'), which are instead commonly generated by many naturally-occurring RNAs6. Understanding the molecular mechanism by which large RNAs avoid ‘kinetic traps' is important to improve RNA engineering and enhance the design of more efficient RNA molecular machines.

Setting a distinctive mark with respect to recent studies that visualized static snapshots of kinetically-trapped RNAs9,17,18,19, our cryo-EM study now captured the dynamic assembly of a large RNA into its functional conformation. We present an ensemble of 3D structures of group II intron intermediates, corroborated and mechanistically enriched by in-solution SAXS data and extended MD simulations and free energy calculations, which reflect the complex dynamic conformational space explored by our target. Our structures offer molecular insights and a precise quantitative description of the structural dynamics of the group II intron scaffold, formed by domain D1, and how such dynamics facilitate the assembly of the catalytically-active ribozyme. We define this assembly mechanism as the ‘dynamic gate mechanism' to highlight the crucial role of D1 dynamics in regulating the docking of the active site motifs into its core (Fig. 9 and Supplementary Movie 1).

D1 transitions from a “closed” state (grey) to a continuum of “open” states in equilibrium between two extreme conformations, i.e., the “partly open” (dark wheat) and “fully open” (light wheat) states. The middle arrow in wheat color represents the continuous dynamics of the D1 between “partly open” and “fully open” states. Upon D5 docking (red), D1 closes back into its “catalytic” state (orange).

Our data show that such a ‘dynamic gate mechanism' relies on two fundamental and distinctive principles, which seem strategic for all RNAs that fold onto a pre-assembled scaffold, avoiding ‘kinetic traps', and may thus represent general RNA folding paradigms.

The first principle consists of the fact that the assembly of peripheral domains onto a pre-assembled scaffold needs to be precisely organized and hierarchically regulated. In the group II intron, our structural data show that D2, D3, and D4 dock one after the other onto D1, in a sequential manner from the 5'- to the 3'-end of the molecule, according to the previously-proposed “first come, first fold” mechanism28 (Figs. 3–5 and Supplementary Table 1). This strategy likely ensures that peripheral domains do not cause misfolding of the scaffold. In group II introns, this strategy is specifically needed to avoid D4 interfering with the folding of D1, because D4 harbors a long open reading frame encoding for the intron-associated protein maturase21. Only in the last assembly step, when D5 enters the “open” core of D1, the molecule locks into a single “catalytic” conformation capable of catalysis, as previously captured crystallographically29.

Unexpectedly, though, our work also shows that such a sequential multi-domain assembly process is not accomplished through the progressive opening of the D1 pocket from the “closed” to the “catalytic” state. Instead, D1 first transits from its “closed” state into “open” states, characterized by a pocket much wider than the “catalytic” state. This observation defines the second distinctive principle for RNAs to avoid ‘kinetic traps'. The pre-assembled scaffold needs to be dynamic and able to sample a wide range of conformations separated by low energy barriers. In our work, we have specifically captured a continuum of previously-unrecognized D1 “open” conformations – in equilibrium between two extreme and energetically slightly favored states, the “partly open” and the “fully open” states. These “open” states are sampled by D1 only in the presence of 3'-terminal domains (D2-D4), and differ from the conformations of both D1 in isolation (“closed” state), and of D1 in the functionally active ribozyme (“catalytic” state). These “open” D1 conformations are absolutely required for group II intron assembly, because they widen the D1 pocket largely to receive the active site residues. As such, RNA follows the same principles of a nutcracker. Intuitively, one would open a nutcracker widely to comfortably insert the nuts before cracking them. Similarly, the group II intron scaffold opens widely to recruit the active site and splice junctions in its core, before splicing. A rigid scaffold that explores only conformations similar to the fully folded molecule would be much less suited to guide the folding process and would increase the risk of forming unproductive interactions and kinetically trapped conformations. In group II introns, the dynamics displayed by the “open” conformations, toggling between “partly” and “fully” open states, is likely beneficial to facilitate the efficient formation of long-range tertiary contacts, such as θ-θ' (between D1c and D2), and λ-λ' and κ-κ' (between D1c and D5), which form by induced fit and lock-and-key mechanisms, respectively21. These observations help explain a conundrum in group II intron folding, i.e., the combination of their slow folding rate (minutes26) and the lack of kinetic traps26,40. Possibly, establishing a conformational equilibrium between “open” states is a useful strategy that group II introns adopt to control the slow formation of long-range tertiary contacts between regions located far apart from each other in the secondary structure26. The small but not negligible energy barriers that we capture by MD simulations may be functional to coordinate these steps. With respect to long-range interactions, our results specifically explain at the molecular level many biochemical experiments previously reported on group II intron folding8,41. For instance, those earlier studies had observed by hydroxyl radical footprinting and dimethyl sulfide probing that the θ-θ' interaction between D1c and D2 is only stably established in the presence of D5. In line with these chemical probing data, here we show that θ-θ' is not stably formed in the “open” conformations of D1-2, D1-3, and D1-4. Moreover, our structures reveal that the tertiary motifs κ, ζ, and λ also remain flexible throughout the group II intron assembly process, in line with other previously reported chemical probing experiments, which had established that these motifs are chemically reactive under near-physiological conditions, until D5 has docked onto D1 to form the catalytically-active intron27,42. Thus, our data confirm the existence and provide a direct visualization via cryo-EM of dynamic group II intron assembly intermediates postulated two decades ago.

It has to be said that not observing ‘kinetic traps' does not necessarily exclude their formation. As a matter of fact, during grid optimization, we observed particle unfolding, aggregation clusters, and non-specific ice behaviors, e.g., leopard ice, which we minimized by optimizing RNA concentration, blot force, and blot time at the plunge freezing step. We also optimized each data set by manually curating the micrographs, excluding unfolded and aggregated particles and retaining the high-quality images most suitable for particle picking, 2D classification, and 3D reconstruction (see Materials and Methods for more details). But crucially, to determine the structure of all constructs, we maintained close-to-neutral pH and close-to-intracellular concentrations of physiological ions, and in general, we used biochemical conditions that are optimal for splicing. The fact that our structure-based design of hinge 1 mutations led to the production of a catalytically inefficient construct suggests that our structural work captures functionally meaningful molecular mechanisms.

From our data, the hinge 1 motif emerges as a crucial determinant for the allosteric modulation of the splicing reaction, as also suggested by recent studies that structurally characterized the first step of the splicing reaction via the branching pathway43. Within hinge 1, residues A72 and C116 specifically stand out as the pivot point that regulates the opening and closing of the D1 ‘dynamic gate'. These residues transition from a bulged-out conformation characteristic of the “closed” state (the isolated D1 scaffold), to a hybrid bulged-in/bulged-out conformation characteristic of the “open” states (D1 in the presence of D2 and D3), to a fully bulged-in conformation characteristic of the “catalytic” state. Notably, hinge 1 residues are conserved and adopt an internal loop structure across all classes of group II introns, from bacteria to yeast and plant organelles, suggesting that the conformation of the D1c stem and its internal loop separating ‘core D1c' from ‘peripheral D1c' is important. Interestingly, in many introns, the hinge 1 motif contains insertions that form additional long-range interactions (Supplementary Fig. 14). For instance, long helical insertions at positions homologous to C116 in group IIA and IIB introns establish kissing loop interactions (β-β') within D1. Instead, short single-nucleotide insertions in the group IIC intron from Eubacterium rectalis form interactions with D543. These evolutionary considerations – along with the functional defects that we observed for hinge 1 mutants in homologous bacterial and yeast introns – point to the fact that the hinge 1 motif is a critical functional element for regulating access to the D1 core and for positioning peripheral D1 nucleotides in the correct orientation to form stabilizing long-range interactions needed for catalysis.

The hinge 1 motif, and particularly the toggling nucleotides A72 and C116, thus emerges as a potentially vulnerable site, which could be exploited to trap group II introns in unproductive conformations, for instance, using small molecule inhibitors. Complementary to direct targeting of the intron active site23, such RNA-directed drug design strategy could be of important relevance for human health, because the self-splicing group II introns are validated therapeutic targets to treat fungal infections44.

Besides highlighting the complex D1 dynamics, our group II intron assembly study also provides specific mechanistic insights of potentially broader relevance for other RNAs. The dynamic interplay between RNA helices, which is a characteristic feature of our ‘dynamic gate mechanism', represents a more-generalizable fundamental principle to guide RNA assembly across biological systems, and ensure that functional RNA components are assembled precisely, in a tightly-controlled fashion. For instance, in riboswitches – which represent another class of regulatory non-coding RNAs – the assembly and dynamics of helices in the aptamer domain dictate the specific conformation adopted by the RNA and decide the transcription fate. This concept is well exemplified by the manganese-sensing transcriptional riboswitches, whose aptamer subdomain helices acquire undocked, semi-docked, or docked conformations in different assembly states45. Structurally and functionally important angular movements of RNA helices also occur in larger RNAs, like the ribosome. For example, during processome assembly, helical rRNA subdomains undergo substantial angular motion to acquire their pre-40S conformation46. Analogously, during co-transcriptional translation, helix H44 in the bacterial rRNA undergoes a pronounced angular motion to facilitate the entry of newly transcribed mRNA emerging from the RNA polymerase47.

Finally, besides elucidating key aspects of RNA assembly and evolution, our data also showcase the power of cryo-EM to resolve the complex dynamic behavior of large RNA molecules, based on established 3D classification approaches. These approaches remain essential, as RNA structure prediction algorithms, including AI-based ones like AlphaFold3, may not always reflect the dynamic behavior of RNA48,49,50. By employing manually curated 3D classification, we achieved robust and reliable structural interpretations while minimizing the likelihood of hallucinations associated with self-supervised learning frameworks, such as variational autoencoders employed in cryo-EM data processing methods like CryoDRGN, particularly under conditions of low signal-to-noise ratios37,51,52. Through our work, we demonstrate the feasibility of using and acquiring biologically relevant information from 3D variability analysis for protein-free RNA samples.

In summary, by integrating the latest advances in single particle cryo-EM and image processing with enzymatic, biochemical, biophysical and MD simulation studies to determine the assembly mechanism and resolve the complex structural dynamics of a group II self-splicing intron, our work provides a near-atomic resolution molecular movie of a large multidomain RNA in the process of acquiring its functionally active conformation and establishes a basis for understanding how RNA uses the conformational dynamics of its helical and junction motifs to avoid the formation of non-functional ‘kinetic traps' (Supplementary Movie 1).

The D1, D1-5, and pOiA constructs of the O. iheyensis group II intron and the D135 construct of the S. cerevisiae ai5γ group II intron (ai5γ-D135) have been described previously28,29,39. Here, we have generated the O. iheyensis group II intron D1-2 and D1-3 constructs from the D1 vector using sequence- and ligation-independent cloning (SLIC) to add domains D2 and D2-3 before the BamHI site, respectively. Moreover, we have generated the O. iheyensis group II intron D1-4 construct from the D1-5 vector by SLIC by removing D5. We note that we have used a group II intron crystallization construct to design the constructs of the domain assembly intermediate. In the crystallization construct, D2, D3, and D4 have truncated sequences and not the wild-type sequence. The truncated regions are not required to stabilize the D1 in “catalytic” state, as it can be observed from the previous crystal structure of group II intron (PDB id: 4FAQ). Finally, we have generated the O. iheyensis group II intron hinge 1 mutant (pOiA-hinge1mut) from pOiA by mutating residues U71A72A73 to GUC to base pair with complementary nucleotides G114A115C116 and lock hinge 1; and we have generated the S. cerevisiae ai5γ group II intron hinge 1 mutant (ai5γ-D135-hinge1mut) from ai5γ-D135 by exchanging residues G124A125C126 to a U, to base pair with A77 and lock hinge 1. We validated the sequence of all vectors by DNA sequencing (Eurofins). We used E. coli Mach1 competent cells for cloning and plasmid amplification. We extracted plasmids with mini and maxi prep kits (QIAGEN) from single colonies. All primers used for cloning are listed in Supplementary Table 5.

We produced and purified D1, D1-2, D1-3, D1-4, pOiA, pOiA-hinge1mut, ai5γ-D135, and ai5γ-D135-hinge1mut by non-denaturing methods34. Briefly, we linearized all vectors using the BamHI restriction enzyme (NEB). Then, we used linearized vectors for in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase in the buffer containing 22 mM MgCl2, 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mM spermidine, 10 mM DTT, and 0.01% Triton X-100 100%. Following transcription, we sequentially removed template DNA and proteins using Turbo DNase (Thermo Scientific) and proteinase K (Promega), respectively. Finally, we rebuffered RNA into 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Na-MES pH 6.5 buffer using Amicon Ultra-0.5 centrifugal concentrators (molecular weight cut-off of 100 kDa).

We performed gel electrophoresis using 2% agarose gels containing 5 µL of SYBR Safe dye. Before loading the RNA sample in the gel, we diluted the sample 10 times with rebuffering buffer to a final volume of 10 μL. Then, we added 2 µL of 6x RNA native gel dye (0.5x TB buffer, 40% sucrose, 0.5% w/V Orange G). We ran all the gels in 1x TB buffer (89 mM Tris base, 89 mM boric acid) at 110 V for 30 min. After electrophoresis, we imaged the gels on a Gel DocTM XR+ (Bio-Rad).

We used purified RNA at concentrations of 10 μM to inject on a SEC column using Tricorn columns (GE Healthcare) self-packed with Sephacryl S400 resin. We pre-equilibrated the column in 10 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM Na-MES pH 6.5 buffer and performed the chromatographic run in the same buffer.

We performed size exclusion chromatography coupled to small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS)53,54 using centrifugal filters (pore size 0.22 mm) to filter the RNA before injection. We injected 10 µM RNA on Tricorn columns (GE Healthcare) self-packed with Sephacryl S400 resin. We used 50 mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl, and 5 mM Na-MES pH 6.5 as running buffer. We acquired SEC-SAXS data at the BioSAXS beamline BM29 at ESRF, Grenoble. We analyzed the data using ATSAS modules CHROMIXS, PRIMUS, CRYOSOL, GAJOE, and DAMMIF55. We used CHROMIXS to visualize the SEC-SAXS output of scattering intensity and UV absorbance. We selected suitable frames for buffer subtraction and suitable frames corresponding to the elution of the sample to obtain the scattering curves. We used PRIMUS to visualize the scattering curves and obtain hydrodynamic parameters, such as the radius of gyration (Rg) and maximum pairwise distance (Dmax). We used CRYOSOL to compare the available D1 crystal structures with the scattering intensity curves. We used GAJOE to compare the “partly open” and “fully open” ensembles of D1 obtained from 3DVA analysis with the scattering curves.

We carried out MP experiment56,57 by thoroughly cleaning coverslips using MilliQ water and isopropanol. Then, we coated the coverslip with 0.01 % poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich). We used 2–20 nM concentrations of RNAs for our measurements. We used the RNA CenturyTM Markers ladder (Applied Biosystems) to generate standard curves. We acquired MP data using the Acquire MP software and the Acquire Measure software to determine the molecular weight of the samples.

We in vitro transcribed radiolabeled intron precursors (pOiA and pOiA-hinge1mut) in the presence of α-32P UTP (Revvity), purified them by gel electrophoresis, refolded them by denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min in the presence of 40 mM Na-MOPS pH 7.5, and cooled them at room temperature for 2 min29. Then, we added KCl to a final concentration of 150 mM and MgCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mM29. We took aliquots at the indicated time points, quenched them with urea, and analyzed them on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel29. We quantified the gels in QuantityOne (v 4.6.6, Biorad) and calculated the kinetic rate constants (k1, k2) of wild type and mutated intron using Kintek Explorer (v 8.0.190104, Kintek Global). For representation purposes, we plotted the data using the Prism8 package (GraphPad Software)29. We run all experiments in triplicate. We report the data as average ± standard error of the mean (s.e.m.).

We performed the FRET-based SER assay23 using refolded purified ai5γ-D135 and ai5γ-D135-hinge1mut by denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min in the presence of 50 mM K-MOPS pH 7.5, and then cooled them to room temperature for 2 min. We added KCl to a final concentration of 150 mM to reach a concentration of 200 nM intron. We prepared the fluorescently labeled RNA oligo substrate [Integrated DNA Technologies, CGUGGUGGGACAUUU/iAlex555N/CGA/3BHQ_2/23] as 10x concentrated stocks at concentrations of 0, 40, 80, 120, 160, 240, 320, and 640 nM in reaction buffer consisting of 50 mM K-MOPS pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl and 300 mM MgCl2. We prepared 96-well PCR plates (Azenta Life Sciences) by pipetting 9 μL of a mixture of the purified and refolded intron plus 10% DMSO at the bottom of each well, and 1 μL of 10x oligo solution on the side of each well. We then spun the plate immediately before the run in a vertical table-top centrifuge to mix the intron and oligo solutions and reach a final concentration of 160 nM intron, 50 mM K-MOPS pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 30 mM MgCl2, and 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, and 64 nM oligo, respectively. We incubated the 96-well plate at 37 °C in an RT-PCR machine (Biorad), measuring the HEX channel fluorescence of each well every 30 s. We measured each condition in technical triplicate in the same plate. Additionally, we performed three independent replicas for each plate (a total of nine measurements per data point). We normalized the data by subtracting the averaged blank signal (no oligo). We calculated the vmax and KM values by measuring the initial slope (first 10 cycles) of the response curves and by fitting the data using Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk plots. We report the data as average ± s.e.m.

A complete checklist and data for MD simulations are provided in Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Data 1. We have used two systems to perform SAXS-driven metainference metadynamics simulations of the isolated D1: the D1 group II intron in the “closed” and “catalytic” conformations as obtained from PDB id 4Y1O and 4FAQ, respectively. To use the same topology for both conformations and perform multiple-replica simulations, we modeled the “closed” state by performing a steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation starting from the “catalytic” structure. We used the RMSD relative to the “closed” state as a collective variable, which was linearly decreased to reach 0 nm value using a force constant k = ~25 kcal•mol−1. We used the same approach to generate the seed models for the simulations of the construct D1-2. In both cases, we replaced every Ca2+ ion in 4FAQ with Mg2+ to simulate catalytically compatible conditions. Importantly, the structural positions of these ions are strictly conserved across group II intron catalytic states29,58, and we had already confirmed in previous studies that such ionic replacement does not affect the behavior of the molecule in MD simulations23,30. Nonetheless, here, to further check whether the replacement of Ca2+ with Mg2+ in 4FAQ accurately mimics the conditions that lead to capturing 4Y1O, we have performed additional equilibrium MD simulations starting from our modeled D1 in isolation (i.e., D1 coordinates from 4FAQ, Ca2+ replaced with Mg2+). Our simulations show that in these conditions, D1 spontaneously collapses into a closed conformation similar to that found in 4Y1O, suggesting that replacing Ca2+ with Mg2+ reproduces the behavior of D1 in isolation (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Similarly, we have used two systems for MD simulations: the D1-3 group II intron in the “partly open” conformation and in the “fully open” conformation obtained from cryo-EM experiments. Both molecular structures had unresolved residues. In the “partly open” structure, the missing residues were modeled outward from the helix. Since the “fully open” structure had a greater number of experimentally unresolved bases, we performed steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation starting from the “partly open” model. During the SMD, we used two collective variables (CVs). The first CV was the RMSD relative to the resolved residues of the “fully open” cryo-EM structure. The second CV utilized 20 configurations extrapolated from cryo-EM data using CryoSPARC. We employed these configurations to create a molecular path for the conformational transition under investigation. We based this molecular path on the positions of the P atoms in the backbone of a portion of D1, using the PATHMSD CV implemented in PLUMED59,60, defined as follows:

During the SMD, we decreased the RMSD linearly over the simulation time until it reached a value of 0 nm, using a force constant k = ~25 kcal•mol−1. In contrast, we kept the second CV, zpath, fixed at 0 using a force constant k = ~500 kcal•mol−1.

For the parametrization of RNA, we used the AMBER-ff12SB (ff99 + bsc0 + χOL3), incorporating the Joung–Cheatham parameters61 for monovalent metal ions (K+) and the parameters by Li et al62. for divalent metal ions (Mg2+)63. We enclosed each system within a box measuring approximately 127 x 129 x 113 Å3, which was filled with a 20 Å layer of TIP3P water molecules. The simulation boxes contained approximately 59,000 water molecules, bringing the total atom count for each system to about 190,000. We added magnesium and potassium ions to neutralize the systems in a ratio of about 1:3 to mimic ionic concentrations of 50 mM for magnesium ions and 150 mM for potassium ions as used in our SAXS experiments. We first energetically minimized each molecular complex. To equilibrate each system, we sequentially performed 1 ns in NVT ensemble at 310 K, and 5 ns in NPT ensemble at 1 bar and 310 K simulations starting from each initial minimized structure. We controlled the temperature and pressure of all systems using the v-rescale thermostat64 and Parrinello−Rahman barostat65, respectively. We calculated the electrostatic interactions using the particle mesh Ewald method66 with a real space cut-off of 11 Å. We set the cut-off value for van der Waals interactions at 11 Å. We performed the MD simulations with the GROMACS 2023 software package patched with PLUMED 2.960. We performed analyses on production trajectories, i.e., after the equilibration of the systems.

We have performed metainference metadynamics simulations on the isolated D1 and the construct D1-2 with well-tempered, parallel-bias, and multiple walker protocols, using 6 parallel replicas starting from both the “catalytic” and “closed” conformations (three replicas, each)67,68,69,70. We have used 3 collective variables. The Z and S components of one path collective variable are defined by 15 equally spaced intermediate conformations of the nucleotides 71–73 and 115–116 (hinge 1), going from bulge-in to bulge-out states as captured by PDB id 4Y1O and 4FAQ, respectively. The third collective variable is represented by the Rg of D1. We biased the S and Z components and the Rg by depositing Gaussians of 0.3 kJ/mol height every 500 steps, using a bias factor of 15, and using a sigma of 0.5, 0.01, and 0.033 in the appropriate unit for each coordinate, respectively. Each replica spans ~250 ns for D1, and ~400 ns for D1-2, summing up to ~3.9 µs total simulation time.

We calculated a set of 15 representative SAXS intensities at different scattering angles, ranging between 0.01 and 0.5 nm−1 and equally spaced, with PLUMED using atomistic structure factors71,72. We applied SAXS restraints every 10 steps and used atomic scattering factors to back-calculate the 15 SAXS intensities. Both \({\sigma }_{i}^{{SEM}}\) and the \({\sigma }_{r,i}^{B}\) were automatically estimated. SAXS restraints were applied every 2 MD steps, and atomic scattering factors were used to back-calculate the 15 SAXS intensities67.

To improve the sampling of the conformational space during the transition between the “partly open” and “fully open” state of the D1-3 system, we employed multiple walker well-tempered metadynamics (MW-MetaD) simulations. Specifically, we simulated two molecular systems for 1 μs of simulation time, one corresponding to the “partly open” state and the other to the “fully open” state. During MW-MetaD, the simulations shared the deposited bias, allowing for faster convergence. We applied the bias to the spath CV (see Eq. 1) based on a new path derived from the SMD simulations described above. The reference path involves only the positions of the P atoms in the backbone, which rearrange as defined by the SMD data, and uses the spath as the CV that tracks the progress of the system along the reference path. Constraining only the P atoms in the backbone provided freedom to the orientation of the nucleotide bases, allowing them to explore the conformational space freely. Additionally, we maintained the zpath CV (see Eq. 2), which accounts for the distance of sampled conformations from the reference path, below 0.2 nm (with a force constant k = ~5000 kcal•mol-1) to explore conformations closely aligned with the reference path. In this manner, the MW-MetaD simulations sampled the conformational space to identify the lowest energy pathway for the conformational change under examination. We constructed this new path by extracting 20 configurations evenly spaced along the RMSD variable relative to the wide-open conformation. The spath CV has a value of 1 in the “partly open” state and a value of 20 in the “fully open” state. We used a bias factor of 8 and a σ = 0.5.

We applied 1.6 μL of the samples on both sides of glow-discharged 300-mesh R 1.2/1.3 Quantifoil Cu (copper) grids. We blotted the grids for 1 s and then vitrified them in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the chamber at a temperature of 22 °C and at 100% humidity. We acquired 26,214 micrographs of the D1-2 sample at ESRF CM01 at a dose rate of 38.07 e/Å2. We acquired 16,719 micrographs of the D1-3 sample at the EMBL Heidelberg imaging center facility at a dose rate of 40 e/Å2 on a 300 KeV Titan Krios with a Gatan K3 camera. Finally, we acquired 12,225 micrographs of the D1-4 sample at the EMBL Heidelberg Imaging Center facility at a dose rate of 40 e/Å2 on a 300 KeV Titan Krios with a K2 camera.

We used CryoSPARC versions 3.0 and 4.0 for data processing. Processing consisted of motion correction, CTF estimation, manual curation, particle picking, extraction (250 Å box size), 2D classification, ab initio modeling, and 3D classification.

Upon obtaining a homogenous-refined single model, we used 3D variability analysis to obtain the ensemble of cryo-EM maps for the D1-2, D1-3, and D1-4 samples with 3 components and filter resolution settings at 4.0, 4.0, and 6.0 Å, respectively. We built models for the 20 3DVA cryo-EM maps of each construct, following the hierarchical rigid-body protocol outlined in ref. 73 using the X-ray structure PDB id 4FAQ as a starting model. We performed rigid-body restraints defined using RIBFIND274, and then flexibly fit the models into the cryo-EM maps using the software TEMPy-ReFF75.

For highly-selective particle exclusion, we employed an in-house procedure to iteratively score, rank, and select targeted individual particles of the D1-2 and the D1-3 datasets. This approach aimed to maximize the proportion of high-quality particles using iterative scoring of each individual particle against re-projected map of each conformational state of group II intron domain constructs, followed by particle re-ranking and re-selection. We confirmed the overall enhanced quality of the selected particles by re-estimating positional and angular parameters using the non-uniform refinement and 3D reconstruction in CryoSPARC. Then, we used coordinates extracted from PDB id 4FAQ as a starting model to manually fit into the sharpened cryo-EM density map obtained with DeepEMhancer. Successively, we performed real-space refinement in Phenix to obtain the map-to-model cross-correlation scores. We used these latter models to correct RNA geometry using the software ERRASER76, and we finalized refinement with TEMPy-ReFF using the GMM (Gaussian mixture model) fitting mode (Supplementary Figs. 5–6).

For D1-4, due to the lower resolution of this dataset, after 3D classification, we have performed non-uniform refinement to obtain maps for the “partly-open” and the “fully-open” states. We then used the coordinates of D1-2 obtained as described above, and TEMPy-ReFF to flexibly fit the models into the cryo-EM maps. We then performed real-space refinement in Phenix to obtain the map-to-model cross-correlation scores and directly finalized refinement with TEMPy-ReFF using the GMM fitting mode (Supplementary Fig. 7).

We validated each of the resultant atomic models using TEMPy SMOC score73 to assess nucleic acid fit-to-map quality (averages across nucleic acids are reported in Table 1) and using Phenix77 to assess overall fit-to-map and validate geometry.

All distances and angles reported in the text were measured between independently refined atomic models, not directly from raw density. Helical axes were defined by a least-squares fit of all sugar–phosphate backbone atoms to a central line78,79.

Scientists secretly wired dogs' brains to steer their behavior, revealing just how far the agency was willing to push its Cold War ambitions.

THANKS TO A CACHE OF DECLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS, the public is now well aware of the Central Intelligent Agency's misadventures in mind control throughout the 1950s and 1960s. MKUltra—the agency's top-secret and wide-ranging human experimentation program—involved 149 subprojects that made test subjects out of thousands of unsuspecting Americans, jolting them with high-voltage shocks, zapping them with radio waves, and dosing them with psychedelic drugs in a bid to develop brainwashing techniques for use on Soviet adversaries. 

But humans weren't MKUltra's only non-consenting participants. Animal subjects also played a starring role in research designed to enhance espionage efforts during the Cold War. Surgeons implanted microphones into cats' ears. An elephant was allegedly injected with a massive amount of LSD. And, in one particularly grisly endeavor, scientists implanted electrodes into the brains of six dogs in an attempt to control their movement and turn them into remote-controlled assassins. 

The goal of that last initiative, Subproject 94, which took place in 1961 and 1962, “was to examine the feasibility of controlling the behavior of a dog, in an open field, by means of remotely triggered electrical stimulation of the brain,” according to heavily redacted documents declassified in 2002. 

Perhaps more remarkably, the experiments were largely successful. “You could, in fact, remotely control the behavior of these animals, especially using positive feedback,” says John Lisle, a historian and author of the book Project Mind Control: Sidney Gottlieb, the CIA, and the Tragedy of MK Ultra.

The project did face some setbacks. Dogs developed infections and researchers struggled to find a suitable secluded space to test out their mutant puppies. The agency cancelled Subproject 94 before the technique was ever used in a real operation. Yet by the end of the program, Lisle says, the CIA was weighing the creation of even bigger, braver remote-controlled mercenaries: bears, yaks, and even man himself. 

Employing animals to aid and abet espionage was nothing new for the country's intelligence agencies, according to Lisle. 

During World War II, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the CIA, looked to wildlife for help in defeating the Japanese. In one explosive project, scientists in the agency's research and development branch attached incendiary devices to bats they planned to set loose in the Axis nation—where they would roost in buildings before detonating—essentially transforming the flying mammals into tiny, guided missiles. 

During Operation Fantasia, in an effort to scare the Japanese into surrender, OSS scientists painted foxes with radioactive paint that glowed in the dark, hoping to recreate a Shinto portent of doom: the kitsune, a shapeshifting, supernatural fox spirit with the ability to possess humans. The plan was eventually scrapped, but not before a trial run in which the OSS released 30 glowing foxes into Washington D.C.'s Rock Creek Park. 

Under the banner of MKUltra, the CIA continued tapping the animal kingdom for accomplices, training red-tailed hawks to transport cameras over enemy territory and ravens to deposit recording devices on windowsills. Eventually, though, these animal experiments took a Frankenstein-like turn when researchers decided to transform a house cat into a clandestine recording device—by implanting an audio transmitter into the base of its skull and braiding the long antenna into the fur down its back. Operation Acoustic Kitty met a quick and tragic end when its eponymous kitty was taken out for its first training run—and promptly run over by a taxi.  

But Acoustic Kitty may have signaled MKUltra researchers' willingness “to take it to the extreme,” says Lisle. “Previous experiments were just to train animals. Now they are specifically going to control them,” the thinking went.

The 1961 budget for Subproject 94 covered about $55,000 in expenses (about $600,000 today), including $1,000 for “animal food & veterinary services” and $2,000 in “experimental organisms,” which encompassed six dogs of “several different breeds,” according to the experiment's declassified final report. 

To run the experiment, the researchers attached electrodes onto the pleasure centers of the dog's brain and then unleashed the animal in an open field. When the dog moved in the desired direction, it would receive up to 50 volts of electrical stimulation directly to that pleasure center to reinforce the behavior. If the dog stopped or deviated from the desired route, the researcher would end the stimulation. 

“Then it would turn its head to look for that pleasure feeling,” Lisle explains. “Once its head turned to the direction you desired, you would stimulate it again.”

A text from someone you were just thinking about. A dream predicting the future. Coincidence? Or something deeper? Across four chapters, we investigate the science and speculation behind those “gut feelings.” Go Down the Rabbit Hole With Us 

The concept worked well for the humans; the final report details “the relative ease with which a dog may be trained to respond.” For the canines, however, the process was far less pleasant. After some dogs developed infections where their surgical wounds failed to heal, researchers undertook a more invasive procedure, “embedding the electrode entirely within a mound of dental cement on the skull,” running the cords under the skin to a point between the dog's shoulder blades where they were brought to the surface and attached to a harness with a battery pack and stimulator. 

Dogs clearly enjoy the happy zaps that stimulator provided, but when researchers experimented with negative feedback—jolts to electrodes placed on the pain centers—the animal would “stop, ball up, and not want to go anywhere,” says Lisle. 

Researchers working on Subproject 94 envisioned a myriad of ways a remote-controlled dog could assist in warfighting. The pup could be used as a scout to detect radiation, chemical agents, or enemy troops. It could also carry messages and ammunition “over terrain too dangerous, or for some other reason, inaccessible to man.”

And then there was this: “A dog may be used as a guided missile in destroying small strategic structures,” the researchers wrote. “In this case, the dog would carry explosive charges which can be detonated from a distance by means of a radio signal.”

These applications “involve destruction of the animal,” the researchers admitted.  

By the time the final report was written, however, it seems that excitement for the idea had waned, thanks to limited space to practice these experiments out of the public eye—and the dogs' proclivity for distraction.

Regardless, the research seems to have inspired even wilder ideas, as the anonymous author of the report imagines the “interesting possibility […] of an automated control procedure, i.e., instead of guiding the animal continuously by hand from point A to point B, the animal is guided by means of an automatic direction system,” and future experiments “on a range of species.”

Based on documents he's reviewed, Lisle explains the CIA had bigger, hairier species in mind—bears and yaks—who would be “capable of carrying heavy payloads over great distances under adverse climatic conditions,” he writes in his book. 

In other words, the agency hoped the animals might carry chemical and biological weapons into the Soviet Union, making them, “essentially assassination drones.” The ultimate goal, however, was even more audacious.

“Ultimately it was to apply this [technique] to humans, to have Manchurian candidates out there,” Lisle says. “Not that that ever happened, but that was the thinking.”

Scientists have long recognized that conditions affecting the body can also influence the brain. Issues such as obesity, high blood pressure and insulin resistance place strain on the body's metabolic and vascular systems. Over time, this buildup of stress can accelerate cognitive decline and raise the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease.

Researchers at Arizona State University, working with partners at several institutions, now report that these effects may appear much earlier than expected. In young adults with obesity, the team identified biological markers linked to inflammation, liver strain and early injury to brain cells. These small but measurable shifts resemble patterns seen in older adults with cognitive impairment.

The study uncovered another important finding. Many of the young adults showed unusually low blood levels of choline, a nutrient essential for supporting liver health, regulating inflammation and protecting long-term brain function.

"This research adds to the growing evidence that choline is a valuable marker of metabolic and brain dysfunction -- and reinforces the importance of sufficient daily intake, as it is essential for human health," says Ramon Velazquez. "Several new reports published this month further link reduced blood choline levels to behavioral changes, including anxiety and memory impairment, as well as broader metabolic dysfunction."

Velazquez leads the study as part of the ASU-Banner Neurodegenerative Disease Research Center, working with colleagues from the ASU School of Life Sciences, Banner Sun Health Research Institute and Mayo Clinic, AZ. The findings were published in Aging and Disease.

Obesity's Early Impact on Brain Biology

Although obesity is widely known to increase the risk of chronic conditions such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, this study suggests its influence on the brain may develop much earlier. The researchers measured elevated levels of inflammation-promoting proteins and enzymes that indicate liver stress. They also detected higher levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), a protein released when neurons are damaged. NfL was linked to low blood choline levels in these young adults, even though no behavioral changes would typically be expected at this age.

NfL has emerged as an important early signal of neurodegeneration. It is found at elevated levels in people with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Observing these markers in young adults is significant and suggests that obesity may create measurable effects in the brain well before symptoms appear.

The results support the idea that inflammation, metabolic strain and early neuronal changes may be connected in a way that starts much earlier in life than once believed.

Choline's Influence on Brain and Metabolic Health

A central aspect of the study involves choline, a nutrient essential for cell-membrane structure, inflammation control, liver function and the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter important for memory. Participants with obesity had substantially lower levels of circulating choline, and these reductions corresponded with stronger signs of inflammation, insulin resistance, liver-enzyme elevation and NfL.

Although the liver produces some choline, most must come from food. Rich dietary sources include eggs, poultry, fish, beans and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower and brussels sprouts. The researchers also observed that women in the study had lower choline levels than men, a notable finding because women experience higher rates of cognitive aging and Alzheimer's disease.

National nutrition surveys show that many Americans do not meet recommended choline intake, especially teenagers and young adults. Since choline supports the brain and liver, long-term shortages may heighten vulnerability to metabolic stress and intensify the effect obesity has on the brain.

"Most people don't realize they aren't getting enough choline," said Wendy Winslow, first co-author. "Adding choline-rich foods to your routine can help reduce inflammation and support both your body and brain as you age."

Nutrient Considerations for New Weight-Loss Drugs

Modern weight-loss drugs have transformed obesity treatment because of their effectiveness in reducing weight and improving metabolic and cardiovascular health. However, the appetite-suppressing effects of GLP-1 medications significantly reduce food intake. This may lead to inadequate consumption of choline and other key nutrients. The authors note the need for future studies to explore whether pairing GLP-1 therapies with adequate dietary choline can help maintain metabolic resilience and overall health.

Study Design and Key Measurements

The research involved 30 adults in their 20s and 30s, split evenly between those with obesity and those of healthy weight. Each participant provided a fasting blood sample. The samples were analyzed for circulating choline, inflammatory cytokines, insulin, glucose, liver enzymes, additional metabolic measures and NfL.

Comparisons between groups revealed consistent patterns: lower choline levels, greater inflammation, metabolic stress and signs of neuronal damage in young adults with obesity. To understand how these findings relate to brain aging, the team compared their results with data from older adults diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease.

The same pairing of low choline and high NfL was found in both young and older adults. This suggests that biological changes associated with Alzheimer's may begin many years before symptoms arise, especially in people experiencing metabolic stress or obesity.

Early Indicators of Long-Term Cognitive Risk

Overall, the study highlights a strong link among obesity, inflammation, choline status and early neuronal stress. This combination may help explain why metabolic disorders increase the likelihood of cognitive decline later in life.

Although the study does not establish causation, it reveals a group of biomarkers that closely resemble those found in older adults with cognitive impairment. The results also align with earlier rodent studies showing that inadequate choline intake in mice can lead to obesity, metabolic problems and increased Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.

"Our results suggest that, in young adults, good metabolic health and adequate choline contribute to neuronal health, laying the groundwork for healthy aging," says Jessica Judd, co-author of the study.

Ongoing research will continue exploring how early metabolic stress may shape long-term risk for neurodegenerative disease and could eventually inform new strategies to protect brain health across the lifespan.

Even the CIA has publicly released data on the psychic phenomenon. 

ON AN OCTOBER night in 1989, a 4-year-old girl was shocked awake by a phone ringing and then a scream. She crept out of her bedroom and tiptoed barefoot along the hallway's clammy vinyl tile, stumbling upon her mother. “He died in a car accident?” she overheard Mom yelp, voice cracking. The girl's dark, shining eyes stared ahead, blank. From the moment she'd thrown her arms around her father as he boarded his flight for that fateful business trip, she knew she would never see him alive again.

That little girl was me, and the strange phenomenon I experienced that night was one of my earliest episodes of precognition.

It was in the shadows of that hallway—while I was awake in a way I'd never been before—when I realized that the dread I'd swallowed during that final goodbye at the airport was more than my imagination. What kind of deranged child stands completely still and tearless after overhearing that her father had died thousands of miles away? Maybe the child who already knew she would never again make tents out of his flannel shirts or breathe in his Pierre Cardin cologne.

Though I had some fear of being seen as delusional, I shared this account over the phone with cognitive neuroscientist Julia Mossbridge, PhD. She listened intently. Afterward, she launched into an impromptu interview, asking me questions as if I were one of her research subjects. Was that your earliest memory of precognition? Do you have frequent precognitive episodes? How can you tell one of these predictions is coming on? She then revealed that she had asked these questions because she could relate. It was her own experience with these strange, sometimes unnerving psychic gut feelings that led her to study them in the first place.

Mossbridge says she has experienced this phenomenon in two distinct ways since she was 7 years old: through precognitive dreams, during which she could gain knowledge about future events, and in waking episodes, when she consciously felt a sense of knowing about a future event. These have helped Mossbridge foretell events of the future that she would have had no other way of knowing. She says these memories of the future could mean the notion of time might not be as linear as we imagine.

“It's not hard to understand precognition,” says Mossbridge, a distinguished senior fellow in human potential at Florida Atlantic University's Center for the Future of AI, Mind & Society. “It's just hard to believe for people who haven't experienced it. We don't understand how time works. Even physicists are admitting they really don't know how it works. We are stuck on this idea that if you're truly scientific, you are going to think about time linearly, but is it really linear? A lot of the resistance to ideas about precognition and psychic phenomena is about fear—the fear of the unknown or the fear that things aren't the way they appear to be.”

Far from the carnival-style fortune tellers whose clairvoyance comes from glancing at their customers' social media accounts in a haze of incense, psychologists and neuroscientists have been trying to figure out what exactly is behind precognition, which is considered a type of extrasensory perception, commonly called ESP. This unshakable feeling that something will transpire in the future is long held among shamans and mystics, yet it remains unexplained by science.

🔮 Ready to go deeper? Check out our new video series, Pop Mech Explains: Precognition.You've probably had that eerie feeling before—knowing what's about to happen before it actually does. Flashes of deja vu. A text from someone you were just thinking about. A dream predicting the future. Coincidence? Or something deeper? Across four chapters, we investigate the science and speculation behind those “gut feelings.” Go Down the Rabbit Hole With Us 

Precognition suggests that our consciousness might actually reach beyond the linear perception of time, according to parapsychologist Dean Radin, PhD, chief scientist at the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS), a nonprofit based in Novato, California, dedicated to the study of unexplained phenomena. Radin has been probing consciousness for decades and is the author of several books on the topic, including Entangled Minds, the award-winning Supernormal, and Real Magic. 

Radin and Mossbridge are IONS colleagues who have collaborated in the past. Both want to show the validity of precognition through statistics gathered from experiments, and they support the view of nonlinear time.

“Time is not how we experience it on an everyday level,” says Radin, who is also an associate distinguished professor of integral and transpersonal psychology at the California Institute of Integral Studies. “In quantum mechanics, time may not even be part of our physical reality. It's not that time doesn't exist. It just behaves in a much stranger way than how it is seen through the lens of the human experience. It suggests there's something probably associated with our consciousness that is different from our everyday experience of time. It's able to jump outside ordinary experience and receive information from the past or future.”

While he was at the University of Nevada in the mid-1990s, Radin created an experiment to prove it. His hypothesis was that if awareness transcended time, responses to an upcoming stimulus would appear before the stimulus itself appeared. Each participant was wired to an EEG machine and then told to press a button to display a random image on a computer screen. The image would either be positive, such as a sunrise, or negative, like a car crash.

The EEG would gauge brain activity within the five seconds between the prompt and the image. Predictions of seeing a positive image elicited little to no emotion or change in brain activity; however, negative images caused increases in brain activity—spikes that would occur before the negative images were even shown.

Since then, this type of presentiment study has been successfully replicated about four dozen times. And in 1995, the CIA even declassified its own precognition research after statisticians were hired to review its work and declared it statistically reliable.

When statistics keep pointing to the existence of a phenomenon, that should be enough proof, says Mossbridge, who is also founder of the Mossbridge Institute, where she and her team of researchers delve into experimental psychology and psychopathology, cognitive neuroscience, AI, and the physics of time. She recalls a physicist doubting her experiment results because he believed in linear time. But Mossbridge's research has shown that most people are capable of some level of precognition. She thinks that more people would actually be aware of this ability—which is often looked at by society as delusional—if it were considered more mainstream. 

Other cultures view precognition differently. Radin has studied Tibetan oracles who anticipated the future, for instance. He realized that clairvoyance, more scientifically known as “remote viewing,” is the ability to see not only through time but also space. Long before news updates and weather forecasts, shamans who were able to perceive the future through time and space would be able to predict whether it would rain or where their enemies were advancing from. Some cultures use psychoactive substances such as psilocybin mushrooms or South American ayahuasca tea to awaken the second sight or “third eye.”

Further, precognition could be explained as a form of quantum entanglement, Radin says. Particles that are entangled share the same information and behave the same way, even from far away, which is what Einstein called “spooky action at a distance.”

Radin says this may explain why we can recall things that have not happened yet. “Some people hypothesize that precognition is your brain entangled with itself in the future, because entanglement is not only things separated in space, but also separated in time,” he explains. “If it can be entangled with itself in the future, in the present you'd be feeling something like a memory that is going to happen in the future.”

Still, skeptics point to other explanations for precognition and parapsychology in general. Unexplained mental phenomena could merely translate to a self-fulfilling prophecy, a concept in social psychology that says our own beliefs can influence our actions and fulfill the original prediction. To those who think the concept of precognition is questionable, it would seem as if I had some anxiety about my dad leaving, which turned into a lingering dread; the fatal accident was therefore a coincidence, and my prediction would be interpreted as a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Mossbridge and Radin stand by their explanations of precognition. It's backed by statistics, Mossbridge claims. It's just a matter of proving what the mechanism could be.

There was a reason the 4-year-old version of myself had no tears welling up in her eyes when she found out her father died. When Mossbridge explained that consciousness might be able to travel through nonlinear time, I began to realize that what I had experienced the night of my father's accident was possibly a quantum phenomenon, something that the mind of a preschooler would have never been able to process. Maybe I was, in fact, remembering something—except it was a memory of the future.

And what if he joked about stabbing his girlfriend/boyfriend? Would the school report him to the police? What the police would do in this case?

The policy and legal frameworks used by US schools clearly state that school district staff are not allowed to remotely activate the microphone or camera on a student's device.There's also legal precedence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbins_v._Lower_Merion_School...When the Robbins case occurred, school districts everywhere took notice. In the organizations I've worked with since then, we no longer activate the microphone or webcam, regardless of the Chromebook's location. However, I can't speak for every school district, whose morals and ethics may vary greatly.> It not too far from what they did when the monitoring software sent the screenshots of an email that never existed.It did exist but it wasn't never sent. The software runs as an agent on the student device and inspects the DOM tree for text phrases it considers alert-worthy: self-harm, threats, drug use, etc.> And what if he joked about stabbing his girlfriend/boyfriend? Would the school report him to the police? What the police would do in this case?This entirely depends on the school and police personalities involved, but the answer is "possibly" or "probably", depending on the jurisidiction.Regardless of the outcome, I think what's really important include the following:- There ARE bad actors employed in every school district! Many of them would love to spy on students, collect naked photos and share them.- School districts need STRICT AND ENFORCED use policy and minimal "need to know" access for TRAINED district staff. No hand slaps. Termination of employment, and legal and criminal consequences are in order.- Auditing flipped on for everything possible (for CYA, if anything). If school staff flips on a webcam, that should be logged somewhere that cannot be scrubbed. In the case of a webcam activation, I'd have it auto-notify key personnel and probably legal. Those audit logs should be reviewed often by multiple auditors -- preferable a third party. Audit events should be backed by extensive documentation, such as a help desk ticket, if anything.- If possible, students should obscure the webcam when not in use to protect themselves. If feasible, I also suggest they get a cheap dummy mic off of Amazon and keep that plugged in.If this type of product survives litigation, we need to move toward assurances of privacy (eg. verifiable Private Cloud Compute model), so this doesn't turn into another Flock situation where certain government entities may have a global/national single-pane-of-glass.I almost said "on-premises" there, but that would be a disaster because school districts don't patch their stuff.

I know fellow millenials that use their work computers for personal reasons. And thats some of the stupidest things you can do. Dont use work or school hardware for personal reasons.I'd also say, if you're running Windows you're also surveilled to hell and back as well. Linux is basically the only platform thats not.And as to larger surveillance, its pervading everywhere. Work. School. Driving (Flock). Commercial web. "Free" services.I'm glad I grew up in one of the last generations that wasn't habitually online. I did loads of "troublesome behavior", that never followed me. Now, some thing will be captured with a smartphone and memorialized forever. And that... Alas. (Old man yelling at cloud, I guess?)

Near memory computing could do wonders.

Wei Shaojun, vice chairman of the China Semiconductor Industry Association and professor at Tsinghua University, said at an industry event that AI accelerators consisting of 14nm logic chiplets and 18nm-based DRAMs developed in China could rival Nvidia's Blackwell processors that are made using a custom 4nm-class process technology at TSMC, reports DigiTimes.

Speaking at the ICC Global CEO Summit, Wei Shaojun indicated that the key to performance efficiency breakthrough would be advanced 3D stacking used to build Chinese accelerators.

Wei Shaojun — who previously said that goals set by China in the 'Made in China 2025' program were unachievable and who later called on the country to cease using foreign AI accelerators like Nvidia H20 and use domestic solutions instead — described a hypothetical 'fully controllable domestic solution' that would combine 14nm logic with 18nm DRAM using 3D hybrid bonding. There is no evidence that such a solution exists or could be built using technologies that are available in China, so the speech is strictly hypothetical.

According to Wei, this hypothetical configuration is intended to approach the performance of Nvidia's '4nm GPUs' despite using outdated technologies. He believes that such a solution could offer performance of 120 TFLOPS, without revealing specific precision. Furthermore, he claims that it would consume only about 60W of power, thus offering higher performance efficiency (2 TFLOPS per Watt) compared to Intel's Xeon CPUs, according to Wei. To put the number into context: Nvidia's B200 processor delivers 10,000 NVFP4 TFLOPS at 1200W, thus delivering 8.33 NVFP4 TFLOPS per Watt. B300 delivers 10.7 NVFP4 TFLOPS per Watt, which is five times higher than what the non-existent AI accelerator could offer.

The key technologies that are meant to significantly improve the performance efficiency of a hypothetical AI accelerator developed in China are 3D hybrid bonding (copper-to-copper and oxide bonding), which replaces solder bumps with direct copper interconnects at sub-10 µm pitches, as well as near-memory computing. Hybrid bonding with sub-10 µm pitches can enable tens to hundreds of thousands of vertical connections per mm^2, alongside micrometer-scale signal paths for high-bandwidth low-latency interconnects.

One of the best examples of 3D hybrid bonding design is AMD's 3D V-Cache, which delivers 2.5 TB/s of bandwidth at 0.05 pJ/bit I/O energy, so Wei is likely looking toward a similar figure for his hypothetical design. 2.5 TB/s per device is considerably higher than what HBM3E can deliver, so it could be a breakthrough for AI accelerators that rely on the near-memory computing concept. Wei also said that the concept could theoretically scale toward ZetaFLOPS-level performance, though he did not outline when and how such levels could be reached.

Wei identified Nvidia's CUDA platform as a key risk not only for the hypothetical alternative he described, but also for non-Nvidia hardware platforms, as once software, models, and hardware converge on a single proprietary platform, alternative processors become difficult to deploy. Keeping in mind that he envisioned near-memory computing as a way to significantly increase the competitiveness of AI hardware being developed in China, any alternative platform that does not rely on this concept (including Chinese AI accelerators like Huawei's Ascend series or Biren's GPUs) may be considered a problem.

They're bending to an imaginary threat that hasn't even been made yet. Nobody said they would sue them over quoting that line. If anyone it would be Rutger Bregman that gets sued by the Trump administration for saying it, not others reporting on it.And even that seems unlikely as it could make this the biggest example of the Streisand effect in history. Bregman would say "See how corrupt he is? He's silencing journalists discussing his corruption" and get 100x more publicity than his lecture ever got.

Black Friday's not just the biggest sale day of the year, it's also the day your home is recovering from the Thanksgiving horde and preparing for the rest of the holiday season. If your old-school upright vacuum and mop or robot cleaner aren't going to be able to keep up, now's your moment to make the biggest upgrade possible — to a Dreame robot cleaner.

Dreame's Black Friday sale is taking up to $800 off the price of their amazingly smart, technologically advanced cleaning machines. If the “technologically advanced” part gives you pause, don't worry — Dreame's floor cleaning robots are among the most autonomous on the market, ready to take as much of the cleaning duties out of your hands as you allow.

The holiday season has just begun and has weeks to go. These Black Friday deals from Dreame are your signal to call in the big guns. Let's check out the five best deals:

With this huge $800-off Black Friday deal, the only shock you'll get from the Dreame X50 Ultra is future shock, because the X50 Ultra seems like it could have beamed in from years into the future. The X50 Ultra was Dreame's big drop for 2025, and it remains the undisputed flagship of the Dreame fleet, and possibly the entire sector.

The biggest of many huge leaps forward made by the X50 Ultra is the ProLeap System, a swing arm paired with two sensors that allows the robot to scale steps and thresholds up to 2.36 inches in height. By far the most common human intervention required by robot vacuums is to rescue it after it's beached on an obstacle, but the X50 Ultra's ProLeap system and VersaLift Navigation virtually eliminate that need. VersaLift is Dreame's highly advanced LiDAR system that scans from different heights to give the robot superior mapping and obstacle avoidance abilities. With a clear path charted, the X50 Ultra puts its exceptionally powerful 20,000Pa of Vormax suction power to work, extracting dirt and dust from thick carpets and hard surfaces.

The ProLeap arm isn't the Ultra X50's only useful limb. It comes with the revolutionary Dual Flex Arm and MopExtend system that reaches into corners and tight spots for comprehensive cleaning. Once finished, the X50 Ultra heads to the AceClean DryBoard dock for recharging and dirt-emptying, plus a fully-automated hot-water wash, rinse, and heated dry of its mop pads. What's left for you to do? Sit back, relax, and watch the Dreame X50 Ultra do its thing, content in the knowledge it was your best Black Friday splurge at 50% off.

We're not a fan of sibling rivalries, especially when the big brother is the peerless X50 Ultra. But the L50 Ultra isn't one to stay in the shadows, not with its stellar array of cleaning power and advanced tech, and definitely not with a $550 price break for Black Friday that makes it an outstanding deal at just $850.

Everything about the L50 Ultra is premium, if perhaps a half-step below the X50 Ultra. But that still ranks it very, very highly on the overall list of robot cleaners on the market. The threshold-beating ProLeap retractable legs and corner-cleansing Dual Flex Arm systems are present and accounted for, along with a stout 19,500Pa of Vormax suction power and a HyperStream Detangling DuoBrush that conquers hair up to nearly a foot long without suffering those work-stopping brush tangles.

Like the X50 Ultra, the L50 Ultra calls the ultra-advanced AceClean DryBoard dock its home, and takes advantage of the 167-degree hot water cleaning for its mop heads and warm-air drying that spares you from the lingering smell of damp, dirty mop heads. The 3.2L dustbag won't need changing for up to 100 days — between 3 and 4 times per year. AI-aided obstacle avoidance using RGB and 3D structured light and LED path illumination means next to no attention is necessary from you, which is the whole point of a robot cleaner. In any other fleet, this is the flagship. With this Black Friday deal, it's most definitely not priced like one.

Remember when the mop features on robot vacuums were interesting novelties that functioned far better as conversation pieces than actual cleaning machines? Sure you do, because it was only a few years ago. As the robot vacuum has made enormous strides in technology, the robot mop has followed along. Unsurprisingly, Dreame's at the tip of this spear, creating the Aqua10 Ultra Roller and its market-setting fresh-water mopping system.

The AquaRoll system sends a continuous stream of clean water through the roller while the dirty water is removed, which keeps the roller fresher for far longer than virtually any other robot mop. FluffRoll technology helps keep it clean with a counter-rotating fluffy roller module, and while many robots have retractable mop heads to protect your carpets, the Aqua10 Ultra Roller has Dreame's AutoSeal Roller Guard — an automatically closing cover that creates a barrier between the wet mop and your carpets, and also catches the inevitable drips before they reach your carpet.

The Aqua10 Ultra Roller is all about cleanliness — not just of your hard-surfaced floors, but also of itself. The ThermoHub self-cleaning feature uses water heated to 212 degrees — the boiling point of water. The roller module isn't just cleaned, it's virtually sanitized. And it wouldn't be a Dreame machine without a highly advanced navigation system, in this case the Astrovision NVIDIA-powered obstacle intelligence that commits hazards like chair legs, toys, and even pets to memory and remembers them for future avoidance.

Is the Dreame Aqua10 Ultra Roller the best robot roller on the consumer market? It's certainly at or very near the top of the list. And with a 38% Black Friday deal, it should be at the top of yours as well.

The most effective way to clean greasy, grimy, or sticky messes is with heat, preferably hot water. If you're still stuck in full-manual cleaning mode, that's adding more steps and more drudgery — heating water, filling a bucket, hauling the bucket, dealing with the dirty water, etc. Dreame's H15 Pro Heat wet-dry vacuum creates the heat all on its own, with 185 degrees Fahrenheit ThermoRinse cleaning that delivers piping-hot clean water to the mess and puts its heat-resistant spinning brush to work to cut through it and lift it away.

It takes the H15 Pro Heat only one pass to not only tackle the wet sticky messes but also the loose dry debris. (It's a wet-dry vacuum, after all.) It's not robotic — although it does have an AI-powered robotic arm that reaches for edges, baseboards, and corners —  so you do have to push, but beyond that, all you need to do is fill its clean water tank before you start and then dump the dirty water tank when you're done. Place the H15 Pro Heat back on its charging base, and Dreame's ability to create 212 degrees Fahrenheit boiling water awaits. In a short time, the H15 Pro Heat self-cleans and dries, and with quick recharging, it's ready to roll out again.

Hardwood- and marble-floor enthusiasts, this one's for you. The Dreame H15 Pro Heat wet-dry vac takes some of the worst floor-cleaning work off your plate and quickly bounces back for more, and it's one of Dreame's better Black Friday deals at just $570.

Stick vacuums aren't new, and they have a longstanding rep for being affordable and easy to store. However, they also have a longstanding rep for being short on power and not all that effective. Dreame's Z30 keeps the affordable and easy-to-store parts of the stick vacuum, but adds them to a powerhouse 150,000 RPM TurboMotor that creates 310AW of suction to create a stick-on-steroids cleaning machine.

Interchangeable multi-surface and soft roller brushes are part of the Z30 package, with a deshedding tool that prevents hair and fur wraps from knotting up the brush. The Z30 also adds a formidable brain to its cleaning brawn, with intelligent dirt detection that automatically adjusts the suction power and brush speed based on the amount of dirt it encounters. The LED display at the top of the unit is both your control panel and your readout screen, giving you useful cleaning reports.

The Black Friday market is going to be jammed with stick vacuums, many in that $250 sweet-spot pricing range. But it's a very safe bet none of them will come with the awesome suction power and smart features of the Dreame Z30.

I've been onboard the wireless charging train for nearly a decade, and still remember being excited to finally have a device I could try it with when I bought my iPhone 8 in 2017. Wireless charging felt like magic,despite the fact that it was slow and unreliable, that it wasn't all that unusual to pick up your phone to find it was both way too hot and hadn't charged at all. We've come a long, long way since then.

The most recent innovation is Qi2.2, the latest version of the Wireless Charging Consortium's MagSafe-based standard that requires chargers to feature a magnetic ring and be capable of outputting up to 25 watts of power to Qi2.2-compatible phones. That's really good for wireless charging, although without some additional cooling, you can't expect it to hit that rate for very long, if at all.

Enter the new Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station, one of the first Qi2.2 chargers on the market—and priced like it's the only one, at $230. At first glance, it's no different than any other 3-in-1 stand that you can hang iPhones, Apple Watches, and AirPods on for simultaneous charging. Yet there's more to it than that: it's got a cooling fan to keep your phone from throttling the charging rate. It also has a touchscreen, so you can check the charging power going to each device. You can also see that same info in an app that lets you tweak settings, set the time (its timeout screen shows a clock), and even update its firmware.

Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station (3-in-1, MagGo, AirCool, Dock Stand)

Anker's 3-in-1 Prime Wireless Charging Station great multipurpose wireless charger held back by an obscene price.

Pros

Cons

That's all a lot, but the good news is that the Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station works well, especially when it comes to its big banner feature of fast wireless charging for your smartphone. I confirmed with my partner's iPhone 16 that this charger can get up to 22.5W, as Apple says it and others in the 16 line can. And my own iPhone 15 Pro, which isn't explicitly capable of that, still reached about 17W and held it for long-ish stretches. That's all according to the stand's own display; there's not a good way to check it, otherwise. But the end result was a phone that could fully charge nearly as fast as when I charged with USB-C, yet was still cool—and sometimes cold—to the touch when I pulled it off the charging pad.

These sorts of charging stands—the kind with two stalks, one for a phone and one for an Apple Watch and a wireless charging pad for AirPods—aren't usually pretty, but Anker sure tried! It's sturdy and weighty, and the company used soft touch materials for the base and magnetic pad for iPhone charging. Its stalks are encased in shiny, reflective metal, the base has nicely grippy feet, and its display seems to sit beneath glass.

The phone pad is thick to accommodate the cooling fan and sports vents at the top and bottom to eject hot air through, and you can tilt it up and down for better viewing. The Apple Watch charger, like the AirPods pad, charges at up to 5 watts. Powering this apparatus are a braided USB-C cable and a 65W Anker USB-C wall adapter.

See Anker Charging Stand at Amazon

I am a sucker for screens on devices that don't usually have them, even when they're extraneous; thankfully, the one on the Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station is anything but. Besides offering key info about the charging wattage of each device sitting on it, you can also cycle through a few options to set things like the charging mode, the time and date, and screen brightness. The clock function is a little under-baked; it doesn't account for daylight savings time in the U.S. (which happened to start while I was testing it), and if you unplug the device and plug it back in, it loses the time completely. You know, like a stove clock. Thankfully, all you have to do is connect to the charger via the Anker app and the time corrects itself. As for the display, it was barely visible under the bright fluorescents of IFA 2025, where I first saw it, but, thankfully, it's perfectly visible in normal indoor lighting conditions.

As for those charging modes, they are Ice Mode, which sets the phone charging pad's cooling fan to full blast; Boost Mode, which is a balanced charging mode in which the fan doesn't run as high; and Sleep Mode, which turns the fan off and is probably best if you use the charger at your bedside. It's nice to have the choice, but also, the fan is already so quiet even in Ice Mode that I didn't bother changing it after testing the various options.

It's my firmly held belief that the screen is good enough that the Anker Prime Wireless Charging Station never needed an app at all, but the Anker app connects to it, so we might as well talk about it. When using the app, you'll connect to the charger via Bluetooth, giving you a screen that shows you a picture of the Prime Charging Station, current output wattage, voltage, and amperage, and a “Real-Time Data” line graph. Tap on that, and you can see a few hours' worth of charging history for each of the charging points.

It's great that Anker has decided to come out of the gate swinging with its first Qi2.2 charging station. The Prime Wireless Charging Station is inarguably nice and certainly worth more than your average no-name Amazon charger. And the company seems like it's really trying to justify the price with the features that this thing comes with. I really like this charging stand and don't mind calling it one of the best 3-in-1 charging stands you can buy today.

The thing that Anker has to contend with here is that the vast bulk of its value is derived from the raw convenience of its tree-style form factor, not from its fast charging, its cooling fan, its touchscreen display, or any of the other niceties. It's just too convenient to have one easy place to plop an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods case at the end of the day, and the bar to improve on that is a lot higher than I think any of Anker's extra features reach. I just can't see myself paying $230 for this.

Anker seems to know that's perhaps too much, and has already discounted the charger to $150 (as of this writing) within less than two months of it being announced. But that's still more than what competing 3-in-1 Qi2.2 chargers cost; see Belkin and its own cooling fan-equipped Qi2.2 charging stand for $130, or Kuxiu, with its tri-fold Qi2.2 travel charger that's fanless and much more vulnerable to thermal throttling in my testing, but also only costs $100. I think you'd have to be a real Anker super fan to buy the Prime Wireless Charging Station for full price or anywhere close to it. Still, it's a great device, and it's totally worth checking its price during Black Friday.

I have not heard of bonsai_web before.Could you feasibly use this to build both web apps and TUI apps simultaneously? If this is the case, I find this extremely interesting. The examples look well fleshed out and interesting.OCAML seems like a perfect language to accomplish this. Ocsigen is pretty complex, but also seems wildly ahead of its time. PPX is a wonderful metaprogramming paradigm and I would love to know how this is being used in production

Govee has evolved into a major player in smart lighting and competes directly with Philips Hue across product categories while consistently undercutting their premium pricing. TV backlighting creates truly immersive viewing experiences by extending on-screen colors onto the wall behind your display and makes action scenes feel more engaging and atmospheric content more enveloping.

At $58, down from $89, the TV Backlight 3 Lite designed for 55 to 65-inch TVs has hit a record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday. Govee offers multiple size variants to match different TV dimensions (40-50″ and 75-85″ are also available) with all configurations receiving Black Friday discounts, though this particular model serves the most common living room TV sizes currently dominating the market.

The camera system records what appears on your TV screen using a wide-angle lens that takes in the entire screen from a single mounting spot. Conventional camera sync systems have issues with the disruptions in the edge colors due to optical distortions in the lenses, especially when the screens are large and the camera systems use wider-angle lenses.

The fish-eye correction algorithm remedies this issue using image processing where distorted inputs are converted to the proper outputs. The technology provides optimal color matching between the images on the screen and the backlight on the entire perimeter of the TV, ensuring that the explosion images on the wall accurately reflect orange and red and that ocean images on the wall and on the TV correctly reflect blue rather than generic blues.

The RGBICW LED arrangement combines red, green, blue, independent control, and white LEDs in a single light bead and provides much better color definition than the typical RGB LEDs. The independent control enables different parts of the LED light strip to provide different color displays at the same time, producing flowing gradients and dynamic effects that reflect the action on the screen.

The length of 11.8 feet can be considered adequate when routing it through the back perimeter to cover 55-65-inch screens. Unpacking and mounting the product takes anywhere between 20-30 minutes. The mounting process includes cleaning the back side of the TV, mounting the strip on the edges, fixing the camera above and/or below the TV, and then wiring the power using the adapter provided.

The WiFi connectivity feature enables the user to operate the lights using the Govee Home application, through which they can customize aspects such as brightness, colors, sync settings, and pre-programmed light scenes. Voice-control functionality via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant enables hands-free switching on and off, and adjustments in the brightness setting, or the execution of pre-programmed light scenes.

With a price tag of $58, the Govee's TV backlight comes with camera-enabled screen syncing, fish-eye correction and has a coverage range of 11.8 feet when paired with 55-65 inches screens, all offered at 34% markdown on Black Friday sales. The Govee offer now brings affordable ambient lighting solutions within the reach of the masses.

Quentin Tarantino hasn't released a feature since 2019's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and fans of the filmmaker are still waiting to hear what his next film (his 10th, and purportedly his last) will be. (We've long since stopped speculating about his Star Trek movie.) However, there sure has been a lot of Kill Bill talk lately, hasn't there?

Fresh interest in the Uma Thurman-starring revenge flick—an epic kung fu and yakuza riff that pays homage to Bruce Lee, Sonny Chiba, and beyond, with an anime interlude, sword fights, training montages, rock n' roll sequences, and gore galore—started with the release of Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair in theaters. The special presentation edits together the two-part movie (originally released separately in 2003 and 2004) and will soon be hitting theaters nationwide—meaning you don't have to travel to a Tarantino-owned cinema to get your eyeballs around it.

But if you crave more Kill Bill and long to witness more slicing blades featuring the Bride and her foes, Fortnite is here to serve. The game, long a curious source of exclusive and/or oddball pop culture content, will be rolling out The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge this weekend.

“Visionary director Quentin Tarantino had a dream of a Kill Bill chapter that never made it to the silver screen, a chapter known as ‘Yuki's Revenge,'” explains the official Fortnite blog. “Over 20 years later, Tarantino and Epic have come together to bring the story to life in Fortnite. Built with Unreal Engine and character models from Fortnite, Tarantino's The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge stars Uma Thurman.”

And yes, there's a trailer, which gives us a glimpse of Yuki Yubari herself—the sister of Gogo Yubari, the cute yet terrifying schoolgirl played by Battle Royale standout Chiaki Kuriyama in Kill Bill. It definitely appears that Yuki is just as adorably sadistic as her sister.

Even with all those weapons… our money's still on the Bride.

If you want to watch Yuki's Revenge in Fortnite, it premieres November 30 at 2 p.m.; as the blog explains, “You'll be able to find it in the top row of Discover. Doors for the viewing experience open 30 minutes before the show starts.”

But if gaming's not your thing, “starting December 5, participating theaters in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom will show Yuki's Revenge as part of an exclusive limited theatrical run of Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair.”

If Tarantino announces Kill Bill: Volume 3 as his swan song, we can say we saw the signs. Either way, the Kill Bill revival is here to wreck your wedding, bury you alive, rev up your Pussy Wagon, and send you on a cross-country mission to get your daughter back while you plan to (see title). Will you be checking out Yuki's Revenge in Fortnite or making it part of your big-screen re-watch of The Whole Bloody Affair?

His-tagging is a popular approach for protein purification, screening, and assay development because it enables simple affinity-based capture while preserving protein function.

His-tagged proteins have applications in structural biology, binding studies, and medicinal research. Measuring their concentration is critical for assessing expression, maximizing production, and monitoring construct stability.

While conventional methods such as SDS-PAGE or nickel-affinity columns can yield reasonable estimations, they frequently necessitate purification, are time-consuming, or lack measurable precision. Amperia™ provides a practical solution for quantifying His-tagged proteins in crude samples utilizing a premix competition assay.

The sensor-based format provides quick, repeatable results without the need for complex equipment or purification stages.

Amperia uses a premix competition assay format to quantify His-tagged proteins. The sensor surface has anti-His capture sites, allowing for selective detection of His-tagged objects. During the test, the material is combined with an HRP-labeled His-tag detection reagent.

The analyte and detection reagent compete for the sensor's anti-His capture sites. Higher analyte concentrations occupy more sites, lowering detection reagent binding and signal intensity. This inverse signal relationship allows for precise quantification over a wide dynamic range.

Amperia allows for the accurate quantification of various His-tagged proteins, with consistent performance across a wide variety of molecular weights and tag configurations. The assay works in complicated matrices, including crude lysates, and provides reliable standard curves for many recombinant targets.

Abselion started in 2018, at that time under the name HexagonFab, in a small corner of a laboratory at the University of Cambridge.

We set out with the humble goal to make protein research simpler. Scientists should be able to pursue their passion for discovery and innovation, rather than spend their valuable time with tedious, manual tasks. With RED we had access to the ideal technology to create this product. A product that is so compact that it could fit on every bench, and so affordable that it is accessible to everyone. Over the years we have designed, built and tested our first product Amperia and we're proud to introduce it to the world.​

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are major global causes of death. However, their global incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years remain largely unknown, despite their importance for disease prevention and resource allocation. We therefore examined the global epidemiology of ALS/MNDs.

This study analyzed data from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 database for 204 regions (1990–2021), focusing on ALS/MNDs. Data from the world, China, and the G8 countries were analyzed separately. Age-standardized incidence rates were reported for the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s.

A rising global burden of ALS/MNDs, with significant variations across regions and levels of the social development index, was observed in the Global Burden of Disease database. A significant overlap of etiology between neurological diseases and ALS was also identified. Among the G8 countries and China, China and the USA exhibited the highest prevalence rates in the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s, with China showing 3.3 per 10,000 and the USA 4.0 per 10,000 in the 2020s.

This burden exhibits significant variations across different regions and at different stages of social and demographic development, with numerous and diverse factors contributing to these diseases. Through in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the GBD database and related studies, it has been found that there is a high degree of overlap in ALS/MNDs. This discovery lays an important foundation for further research into neurological diseases, particularly the pathogenesis of ALS. In the coming period, research efforts on neurological diseases need to be strengthened further, medical resources optimized, and the increasingly heavy burden of neurological diseases effectively addressed.

The p53–MDM2 regulatory pathway is crucial for genomic integrity, with its dysregulation contributing to over half of all cancers.

MDM2 overexpression suppresses p53's tumor-suppressive activity by promoting its degradation. This study aimed to identify natural product inhibitors of the p53–MDM2 interaction using computational methods.

Phytochemicals from traditional medicinal plants with anticancer potential were screened using BIOVIA Discovery Studio. Lipinski and ADMET filters prioritized compounds with favourable drug-like properties.

Molecular docking (CDOCKER, LibDock) identified potential binders to MDM2 (PDB: 1YCR). Molecular dynamics simulations assessed binding stability (RMSD/RMSF).

Toxicity was predicted using TopKat. Binding energies were compared with clinical MDM2 inhibitors.

Octanamide, n-(2- mercaptoethyl)- emerged as the top candidate, showing strong binding affinity, excellent dynamic stability, favorable predicted safety, and comparable binding energy to several clinical candidates.

This study highlights Octanamide, n-(2-mercaptoethyl)- as a promising natural scaffold for developing safer p53-reactivating cancer therapeutics.

Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality, often linked to the failure of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, which normally eliminates damaged cells.

The p53 protein, known as the "guardian of the genome," plays a vital role by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to cellular stress, thereby maintaining genomic integrity.

Dysfunction in the p53 pathway contributes to over 50 % of human cancers.

MDM2 acts as a key negative regulator, binding to p53's N-terminal domain to inhibit its activity and target it for ubiquitin-mediated degradation.

Overexpression or amplification of MDM2 silences p53, promoting tumor progression. Therefore, inhibiting the p53-MDM2 interaction represents an effective therapeutic strategy to reactivate p53.

While synthetic small-molecule MDM2 inhibitors, such as Nutlins, have shown efficacy, their clinical utility is often limited by issues including toxicity and the development of resistance.

Consequently, natural products, particularly phytochemicals from medicinal plants, are being explored as alternative scaffolds due to their vast structural diversity and potentially favorable safety profiles.

Integrating traditional knowledge of medicinal plants with modern computational drug discovery techniques offers a powerful approach to accelerate the identification of novel therapeutic agents.

Targeting the p53-MDM2 interaction remains a key strategy in oncology, but clinical translation of synthetic inhibitors is challenged by toxicity and limited efficacy

Natural products offer a vast chemical diversity for identifying novel scaffolds. Previous studies identified compounds like Lineariifolianoid A and lignans as potential MDM2 inhibitors

This study employed a rigorous computational approach, combining filtering, docking, MD simulations, and toxicity prediction to screen phytochemicals from anticancer plants

Octanamide, n-(2-mercaptoethyl)-, identified from Vitis vinifera, emerged as the top candidate. It demonstrated:

These findings highlight the potential of computationally screened natural products as starting points for developing safer and effective p53-reactivating therapies.

This computational investigation successfully employed a multi-faceted in silico workflow to identify promising natural product-based inhibitors targeting the p53-MDM2 interaction.

Among the evaluated phytochemicals, Octanamide, n-(2-mercaptoethyl)- from Vitis vinifera distinguished itself through strong predicted binding affinity, excellent stability in the MDM2 binding pocket confirmed by MD simulations, and a favorable predicted safety profile.

These findings strongly support its potential as a lead candidate for restoring p53 function.

This study highlights the importance of combining traditional plant-based medicine knowledge with modern computational chemistry to identify and prioritize natural compounds, such as Octanamide, n-(2-mercaptoethyl)-, for the development of safer anticancer therapeutics. Further experimental validation and structure-based optimization are warranted to advance this promising natural scaffold.

Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecological cancer the second most common female cancer, after breast cancer, in the developed world (1). In the UK EC is the 4th most common cancer and accounts for around 5 % of all new cancer cases in women. In the UK Mortality rates for EC are projected to rise by 12 % between 2025 and 2040 (2)(3). This increasing burden of EC, combined with the limitations of current treatments highlights the need for research into new treatment options that address issues with current treatment for women of all age groups such as fertility-preservation, drug resistance and recurrent/advanced cases (4)(5)(6) RSV, a polyphenol found in grape skin and seeds with properties including anti-cancer activity has demonstrated its effectiveness in enhancing the efficacy of anticancer drugs such as chloroquine (7)(8). Artesunate, is a semi-synthetic, monomeric compound derived from artemisinin a natural product (9). ART is an anti-malarial drug that has promising anti-cancer effects and has shown therapeutic synergy with anti-cancer agents such as paclitaxel and navitoclax in breast cancer cells and 2D and 3D ovarian cancer cell models (10). Despite both drugs being well known for their anti-cancer properties, to our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the effects of ART and RSV in combination on Ishikawa EC cells. Given ART and RSVs individual anti-cancer effects we hypothesised that the combination of ART and RSV will significantly reduce cell viability and enhance apoptosis in Ishikawa EC cells compared the effects of each drug alone.



Figure 1. Dose–response curve of resveratrol (0–200 μM) Ishikawa cells seeded at a density of 1 × 10⁴ cells per well in 96-well plates. Cells were treated for 72 hours, after which cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay. Each concentration was tested in triplicate across three independent experiments (n = 9 /concentration). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance determined by Student's t-test: RSV vs ART (p = 0.002), RSV vs Combo (p = 0.002), ART vs Combo (p < 0.001).

Figure 2. Dose–response curve of artesunate (0–100 μM) Ishikawa cells seeded at a density of 1 × 10⁴ cells per well in 96-well plates Cell viability was determined using the MTT assay after 72 hours of treatment. Each concentration was tested in triplicate across three independent experiments (n = 9/concentration). Data represent the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. Statistical significance determined by Student's t-test: RSV vs ART (p = 0.002), RSV vs Combo (p = 0.002), ART vs Combo (p < 0.001).

Figure 3. HSA, Loewe, ZIP, and Bliss synergy maps for artesunate (ART) and resveratrol (RSV) combinations (0–34.4 μM). Synergy was determined from MTT assay results in Ishikawa cells after 72 h of treatment. Data represent three independent experiments. Green areas indicate concentrations where ART and RSV show synergy. SynergyFinder identified specific regions of high synergy at lower, untested concentrations. Image Credit: Image courtesy of Dixon C. et al., in partnership with ELRIG (UK) Ltd.

We established our baseline the MTT assay showed that both drugs are effective. ART is significantly more potent on its own, with an IC50 value of 7.8 μM (p=0.002), compared to RSV's IC50 of 34.4 μM. We used the IC50 values as the concentrations to conduct another MTT assay to determine whether there was a synergistic interaction between the drugs To investigate synergy, we utilised the SynergyFinder platform to analyse the interaction across four established mathematical models: Bliss, Loewe, HSA, and ZIP. The synergistic relationship between ART and RSV was consistent across all four models: the large green area in each plot confirms that ART and RSV are synergistic across a range of concentrations.



Figure 4. Changes in cell morphology following treatment with ART 7.8 μM, RSV 34.4 μM, and both drugs in combination compared with the effects of no treatment. All treatments exhibit an antiproliferative effect on Ishikawa EC cells. The combination treatment appears to inhibit proliferation the most effectively after treatment for 72 hours.

Figure 5. Human TNF-α levels measured by ELISA at 450 nm. All samples were below the detection limit. Data represent three independent experiments; each performed in triplicate. Image Credit: Image courtesy of Dixon C. et al., in partnership with ELRIG (UK) Ltd.



Figure 6. Flow cytometry analysis of Ishikawa cells treated with artesunate (7.8 μM), resveratrol (34.4 μM), and their combination. Plots show cell size vs caspase-3/7 activity, distinguishing live, apoptotic, and dead populations. The combination treatment induced higher apoptosis than single treatments. Data: 3 independent experiments (RSV, Combo, Control) and 2 experiments (ART), each with triplicate samples. Image Credit: Image courtesy of Dixon C. et al., in partnership with ELRIG (UK) Ltd.

We visually validated this synergy with microscopy. Here, we see the cell morphology after 72 hours. While individual treatments showed some effect, the combination treatment resulted in the most pronounced morphological changes including cell detachment.

We hypothesised the combination works by inducing apoptosis, we assessed using flow cytometry to investigate Caspase 3/7 activity. This confirmed that all treatments induced some level of apoptosis. The combination and RSV treatment achieved similar total apoptotic rates at 4.035 % and 4.025 %. We also assessed if the combination had any anti-inflammatory effect by measuring TNF-α levels using an ELISA assay. Here, all samples fell below the assay's level of detection.

Preliminary results of a national survey conducted by researchers at the Simon Fraser University Faculty of Health Sciences (SFU FHS) has found that Canadians with Long COVID identified virtual healthcare services as essential to their care.

"Many of the 621 survey respondents from across the country shared how lifesaving and essential these virtual services are in providing accessibility to care that reduces risk of infections, travel time, and PEM", shared FHS Research Fellow Kayli Jamieson, who also has Long COVID herself. 

PEM, or Post-Exertional Malaise, is common in many people with Long COVID, meaning that physical, mental, or sensory activity triggers can cause a flare-up in symptoms lasting from hours to weeks. It is one of many factors that contributes to the chronic and frequently disabling nature of Long COVID.

The study, led by FHS Assistant Professor Dr. Julia Smith, aims to analyze experiences with virtual care through an intersectional lens and ultimately produce a national guidebook providing recommendations on improving virtual care access for people with Long COVID.

A research brief detailing the findings to date from the national survey was issued this fall. In addition to the identification of the importance of virtual care, 69 per cent of respondents shared that their primary care provider had low-to-no awareness of Long COVID, identifying another immediate and significant barrier to accessing health care

These preliminary results suggest that virtual care is particularly helpful for people with Long COVID who face barriers accessing health services such as rural, racialized and 2SLGBTQIA+ patients. We are conducting further research to better understand how virtual healthcare can better serve these groups."

Dr. Julia Smith, FHS Assistant Professor 

Additional recommendations include increasing availability of specialized Long COVID services in Canada-a suggestion that will require training more specialists and care providers on Long COVID management for informed, effective, and safe care.

The next phases of the study will include conducting focus groups with equity-deserving populations who have Long COVID and hosting a deliberative dialogue session among patients, clinicians, and policymakers to better identify systemic solutions to address this growing gap in health care.

The race to develop safer, longer lasting, and less invasive treatments is accelerating, and at the heart of that challenge lies drug delivery.

Eli Lilly's move to acquire Adverum Biotechnologies signals industry confidence in long-acting intravitreal gene therapy as a path to durable vision correction and improved adherence.

Adverum's lead program, Ixo-vec, is a Phase 3 gene therapy designed to treat vision loss associated with wet age-related macular degeneration with a single intravitreal dose 

This acquisition aligns Lilly's genetic medicine capabilities with opportunity to expand gene therapy's potential to alleviate the burden of age-related diseases 

Adverum is developing a pipeline of intravitreal single-administration gene therapies with the aspiration of developing functional cures to restore vision and prevent blindness. Its lead product candidate, Ixo-vec, is an intravitreal gene therapy being developed for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD). This serious, chronic and progressive retinal disease affects millions of people worldwide. Ixo-vec is designed as a single one-time treatment to deliver continuous and stable intraocular aflibercept levels, thereby reducing the significant patient burden associated with current chronic anti-VEGF therapies, while also potentially leading to improved vision outcomes.

Ixo-vec is being evaluated in the ARTEMIS Phase 3 clinical trial, which has completed screening. The program has been granted Fast Track and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as well as PRIME designation by the European Medicines Agency and the Innovation Passport from the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency for the treatment of wAMD.

Nerve damage is one of the most common and burdensome complications of diabetes. Millions of patients worldwide suffer from pain, numbness, and restricted movement, largely because damaged nerve fibres do not regenerate sufficiently. The reasons for this are unclear. A research team led by Professor Dr Dietmar Fischer, Professor of Pharmacology at the University of Cologne's Faculty of Medicine, and Director of the Center for Pharmacology at University Hospital Cologne, has now identified a central mechanism that explains limited regeneration in diabetes. Building on this, the researchers have developed a promising therapeutic approach that can be used to increase regeneration. Their findings were published in the Science Translational Medicine journal under the title 'Failure of nerve regeneration in mouse models of diabetes is caused by p35-mediated CDK5 hyperactivity'.

Using mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, the team demonstrated a high accumulation of the p35 protein in nerve cells. This protein activates an enzyme that triggers a signalling cascade, which in turn blocks the regrowth of nerve fibres. This considerably restricts the nerves' natural regenerative capacity. Through targeted interventions in this signalling pathway – either using genetic methods or, pharmacologically, with newly developed small protein building blocks (peptides) that can be administered systemically – the scientists succeeded in removing the block. In the preclinical models, the nerve fibres then grew again at a similar rate to that observed in healthy animals. This was accompanied by significant motor and sensory improvements.

For the first time, our results show that diabetic nerve healing can be brought back to a level that compares with that of healthy animals if the excessive activation of the signalling pathway is inhibited. Even when diabetic neuropathy has already manifested, an improvement in regeneration occurs."

Dr. Dietmar Fischer, Professor of Pharmacology, University of Cologne's Faculty of Medicine

A peptide developed and patented by his research group shows particular promise in this respect, as it targets the underlying cause directly and could, in principle, be developed into a drug.

It is also worth noting that the regeneration weakness caused by diabetes occurs even before the onset of diabetic neuropathy, a common complication that affects almost half of all patients. In a further study, Professor Fischer and his team are currently investigating whether the mechanism they discovered contributes directly to the development of this nerve disease, or whether the risk can be reduced through the new treatment options.

The current study thus opens up new perspectives for the treatment and, potentially, the prevention of diabetic nerve damage, also known as diabetic neuropathy, which is one of the most common and currently incurable secondary diseases worldwide.

It's been 15 years since the U.S. women's national team has faced off against the Italian women's national team, and a lot has changed since then. But on Nov. 28 and Dec. 1, the two sides will face off in two friendlies in Florida to end the year.

Since their last meeting, the U.S. women's national team has won two World Cups and two Olympic gold medals, but Le Azzurre have not found the same success on the international stage. If the Italians have anything to say about it, that's all about to change—and these friendlies against the U.S. are part of the strategy.

“The United States remain one of the most iconic teams in world football and for Italy the real victory is being on that stage, competing against the very best and showing that we belong in these environments,” says Alessandro Orlandi, an Italian FIFA agent and founder of Assist Women, the agency representing Italians Sofia Cantore and Lisa Boattin who have recently joined National Women's Soccer League teams. 

“For an Italian, seeing our players face the U.S. is already a milestone, a signal of how far the movement has come. The result will speak for itself, but the message is bigger than the scoreline. Because once you step into arenas like this, there is no going back. Rise to the level, and the level rises with you.”

With the recent hiring of manager Andrea Soncin, the Italians have started to rise to that level. Their storybook run to the semifinals in last summer's Women's Euro catapulted them onto the national stage. It was the first time that Italy made the semifinals in 28 years, a marked improvement for the storied side. In the intervening months, many players have begun to find playing opportunities abroad when previously, leaving Serie A Women was seen as a rarity.

“This matters because football, especially in the women's game, grows through cross-pollination,” says Orlandi. “When Italian players move abroad, they are exposed to new training methods, different tactical cultures and higher levels of competition. They come back stronger, more complete and more confident. In the long term, this elevates the entire Italian system.”

This summer, Cantore and Boattin joined the NWSL at the Washington Spirit and Houston Dash, respectively. These new journeys are aimed at not only growing their own games, but bringing new elements to Italy's game during a big growth moment for the team. Of the 28 players on the Italian roster this international break, four currently play outside of Italy—a number that continues to grow. 

“They want to challenge themselves,” Orlandi says. “Many of them are driven by curiosity and the desire to test their limits in the most competitive environments. They want faster rhythms, more intensity, bigger stadiums and a stronger global spotlight. Others are attracted by the lifestyle, the structure of the leagues and the opportunity to grow outside their comfort zone.”

The players themselves—like star striker Cristiana Girelli at Juventus, Arianna Caruso at FC Bayern Munich, Elena Linari at the London City Lionesses and Aurora Galli at Everton—are keenly aware of the moment in which they find themselves. After their success at the Women's Euro, they know the sky is the limit, and challenging themselves against big competition like the USWNT will be necessary in the team's ability to seize the moment.

“We have been on a journey since the new head coach [Soncin] arrived, he believed and made us believe that we can compete against even the strongest teams,” said Boattin to Equalizer Soccer earlier this year after joining the Houston Dash. “Obviously we were disappointed with how the [semifinal game] against England went, but I must say it left us with this internal understanding that we have grown, worked hard, and have a strong ground. 

“We were sad, but we believe we're on the right track. We have to keep working. Overall, I especially hope that in Italy they can understand that there's a need to invest—we can't do everything on our own.”

As the program continues to grow, the conversation around the team has grown right along with it. In Italy, women's sports have struggled to find the same foothold as men's, even with the sport of soccer being somewhat of a religion for the country whose men's team brought home the glory of a World Cup in 2006. 

“The narrative has definitely evolved,” says Orlandi. “A few years ago the conversation was mostly about potential, now it is about performance, investment and long-term planning. Media attention is growing, clubs are becoming more structured and fans are increasingly engaged. We are not at the finish line yet, but the tone is more positive, more ambitious and more aligned with what the players truly deserve. There is a cultural shift underway and it is irreversible.”

As the U.S. prepares to take on the Italians, they will be a unfamiliar opponents. Even so, the USWNT has demonstrated success against Italy, notching 11 wins, one draw and only four losses against Le Azzurre. There is also a bit of history between the two sides with Italy being the USWNT's first international match in history in 1985, resulting in a 1–0 win for the Italians.

Italy's playing style has certainly evolved since that first matchup in 1985. Culturally, both the men's and women's side have been known for catenaccio, quite literally a door-bolt, locking things down defensively. The USWNT is used to playing teams who employ a low block, but Italy is not so one-dimensional. 

With the attacking duo of Girelli and Cantore, both of whom were 2025 Ballon d'Or Féminin nominees, plus dynamic midfielders like Roma's Manuela Giugliano, the USWNT will face a side hungry to prove itself on the international stage to end the year on a high. 

For Orlandi, seeing the players he represents succeed for both club and country is all part of growing the larger ecosystem around women's soccer in Italy. 

“Players who experience top environments abroad bring back a mentality shift,” Orlandi says. “They raise standards inside their clubs, influence younger teammates and expand the expectations around professionalism. Their success stories create a cultural wake behind them. Italy benefits twice, because these experiences fuel both the national team and the domestic league. It's a chain reaction that pushes everyone forward.”

Liverpool boss Arne Slot has opened up on his future at Anfield after meeting with the club's owners. The Reds are currently on a dreadful run of form and were beaten yet again on Wednesday night in the Champions League by PSV. Slot's side have now lost nine of their last 12 matches in all competitions, piling pressure on the Dutchman in his second season in charge.

Liverpool's form has collapsed this season, culminating in the Champions League humiliation by PSV, a defeat which marked the club's worst run in over 70 years. The Reds' diabolical form includes being dumped out of the League Cup at home by Crystal Palace and consecutive 3-0 Premier League defeats by Nottingham Forest and Manchester City, followed by the humbling by the Dutch outfit. Fans and pundits alike are questioning the team's lack of fight and individual errors, and the failure of high-profile summer signing to integrate successfully into the team. But Slot has spoken with the Anfield hierarchy and fully believes his job is safe for now.

Slot faced the press on Thursday ahead of Liverpool's next game against West Ham in the Premier League and was grilled on his future. The Dutchman admitted he has spoken with the owners at Liverpool and vowed to fight on. He told reporters: "We've had the same conversations that we've had since I got here. We fight on. We try to improve, but the conversations have been the same as they have been for the last one and a half years." 

And when pressed on what he can change to arrest the dreadful run of results, Slot added: "That's not so easy to say. It's normal to reflect on a game with decisions you have made. Maybe you do it a little bit more if you lose. In the end, it's about doing what this club is about. Keep fighting no matter how difficult it is I would be nice if we rewards ourselves in he moments we play well. People are focused on he parts we don't play well but there are large parts where we do play well."

Anfield legend Jamie Carragher was caught on camera deep in conversation from the TV studio during the match, discussing Slot's decision to continue picking Ibrahima Konate, who was at fault for the third PSV goal. 

Carragher said: "Honest to god, I've had enough of them. That Konate, I mean, that's a sackable offence for the manager for f******g keep picking him. He should be sacked for that." 

Slot had been urged to drop some of his misfiring stars amid Liverpool's run of form and was also asked if he would be making changes to his team for the game against the Hammers. He replied: "Everyone trains with us every single day, and they can prove themselves in that moment. It's always a balance. There was a period where I lost, and I made a few changes and people complained that I made too many changes. Of course, I consider but I can not tell you the end decision of what I've considered for Sunday."

Liverpool head south to West Ham on Sunday in a crucial Premier League match at the London Stadium as both teams are struggling with poor form and mounting injuries. The Hammers are currently 17th in the table, but unbeaten in their last three outings and are hoping to capitalise on the Reds' recent slump. But Slot's side have history on their side against the east Londoners, winning 86 of their 153 total meetings, and are heavily backed as favourites despite their current form. Slot has admitted it will be a difficult test: "It's a tough team to beat at the moment, West Ham. We definitely need to be ready for a challenge."

It is confirmed that Italy will be in pot 4 if they qualify for the 2026 World Cup, so we take a look at the best and worst-case scenarios if the Azzurri qualify.

Italy will need to go through the World Cup play-off to qualify for the competition in 2026 after missing the 2018 and 2022 editions.

Earlier this week, it was confirmed that countries qualifying through play-offs would go into pot 4, which means the Azzurri will theoretically have a quite tough group if they make it to the 2026 World Cup.

The three host countries, Canada, Mexico and the USMNT are in pot one alongside European and South American heavyweights.

Even pot 2 has some solid contenders, including 2018 finalists and 2022 semi-finalists Croatia.

Erling Haaland's Norway already forced Italy to go through the qualifying play-offs by winning Group I and are in pot 3 alongside Mohamed Salah's Egypt and Scott McTominay's Scotland.

Luckily, however, there can be a maximum of two European teams in each group (one from other confederations), so, for example, if Italy draw Spain from pot 1, they can't get Scotland from pot 3.

So, what would be Italy's best- and worst-case scenarios look like if they qualify for the World Cup? Let's take a look, keeping in mind that the absolute worst outcome for the Azzurri would be failing to reach yet another World Cup altogether.

Best-case scenario (based on FIFA Ranking): Canada, Australia, South Africa.

Worst-case scenario (based on FIFA Ranking): Spain, Morocco, Panama

Spain are currently the top-ranked team in the FIFA Ranking, with defending champions Argentina sitting second.

If the Azzurri pick Argentina or Brazil from pot 1, then they could be paired with Croatia (pot 2), or Scotland and Norway (pot 3), making it not necessarily easier to qualify for the Round of 16.

Possibly, the worst-case scenario if Italy get a South American opponent from pot 1 will be: Argentina (or Brazil), Morocco, Norway (or Scotland).

Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany

Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, IR Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia

Pot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa

Pot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2

Why are we talking about this before they even make it ? They have a long shot to make it and we discussing possible groups ?

Already worried before Morocco and Panama before they even get there. That's why Italy is in decline.

Jeff Carlisle reports on the UCL performances of Timothy Weah, Weston McKennie and Malik Tillman. (0:58)

Winter is coming for the U.S. men's national team.

The just-concluded November international window witnessed a pair of impressive performances for Mauricio Pochettino's crew. The 5-1 pasting of Uruguay in particular caught the eye. With plenty of players sidelined by injuries, it opened the door for others such as the Vancouver Whitecaps' Sebastian Berhalter and Orlando City's Alex Freeman to restate their cases for inclusion on the World Cup roster.

And what do they get as a reward? A four-month break until the next international get-together in March. In that time, just about anything can happen, with player fortunes rising and falling. At minimum, the players will get back to the hard slog of performing for their clubs, or in the case of those plying their trade in MLS, getting some time off to rest and recover from a long season. Regardless of where a player is, the stakes have never been higher, and plenty of hard work remains.

The momentum that the USMNT has created over the past couple of windows has been impressive, burying the worries that existed last June into the cold storage of the team's psyche. But momentum can be halted by a few injuries. So Pochettino and his staff will be traversing the globe -- OK, Europe mostly -- to see which players are on the rise and which are falling off.

The break between international windows -- with a few games' worth of club performances since the November camp -- makes this the perfect time to roll out another edition of ESPN's USMNT Big Board, complete with a predicted 26-man squad, and which bubble players might still make a breakthrough.

Freese still has a grip on the No. 1 goalkeeper spot, having started 12 matches in a row. But his error that led to Uruguay's goal last week sows just enough doubt to conclude that his status is not iron-clad. The fact that NYCFC is still in the playoffs, with Freese coming up with some huge saves in the Eastern Conference semifinals win over the Philadelphia Union, will extend his season a bit. But under Pochettino, there are no guarantees of anything.

Turner told ESPN a few months ago that he's "confident that I'll be back in October if I continue the level I'm playing at." And he was. But then, come November, he was nowhere to be found, as Pochettino opted for players who either went deeper in the playoffs or were playing abroad. Could Pochettino really leave Turner at home? Given the Revs keeper's experience, that seems unlikely, but the U.S. manager is very much a "What have you done for me lately?" kind of guy. Turner needs to get out of the blocks quickly in 2026.

- Hernandez: How Roldan went from afterthought to Pochettino favorite

Schulte is the pick here for no other reason than he has been around. It's easy to forget that had he not sustained an injury in June, it might have been him starting in the Gold Cup and not Freese. Every game matters and the new year will determine much in terms of whether he cements the No. 3 keeper spot.

Richards' absence from the November window means little, as he remains a locked-in starter when healthy. He's operating from a position of strength with his club as well, although Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner and Pochettino engaged in a bit of a tug-of-war over Richards' availability. The bottom line is that Richards is wanted for both club and country, which is a great spot.

Ream turned 38 last month, yet he remains a vital players on the U.S. backline, with his positioning, passing and leadership remaining at a high level. Pochettino's recent tactical approach of defending with four and building out of the back with three still plays to Ream's strengths, although he's shielded a bit more when wingbacks are part of the equation. No one has yet come close to pushing him out. He'll get a much-deserved rest now that Charlotte's MLS season is over.

McKenzie enjoyed a solid outing against Uruguay, reminding Pochettino of how his physical presence, and even his ability to carry the ball out of the back, has value to the U.S. squad. McKenzie is also getting steady playing time at Toulouse, which should go far in terms of keeping him in good standing with Pochettino.

Robinson's spot on the roster looked to be vulnerable for a spell, especially when injury ruled him out of the September window. But over the past two camps, he has steadily plugged away and made the most of his opportunities. He even played for a spell at right back against Australia, and that kind of versatility helps when it comes down to roster decisions.

Because of an Achilles injury to Cameron Carter-Vickers, Trusty has taken advantage of opportunities at both the club and international level. The Philadelphia Union academy product has reclaimed his spot in the starting lineup at Celtic, and he put in a steady shift for the U.S. against Uruguay. His spot is vulnerable with Tristan Blackmon returning to health, but Trusty will be playing during the December/January period, while Blackmon won't, giving him a chance to put some distance between himself and his competition.

So what is Dest at this point: an outside back or an out-and-out winger? He was the latter against both Paraguay and Uruguay, although against La Celeste, he was a bit more inverted. The positional switch does play to Dest's strengths more, as it shields him from defensive responsibilities that aren't his forte. His status at PSV remains secure, even after he arrived late for a UEFA Champions League match. Where he plays for the U.S. in 2026 remains an intriguing question. Left back is a bit thin at the moment, and that could be an option.

Scally was among the big beneficiaries of the November window. When he was left off the roster in October, his spot seemed under threat, but he showed off his ability to play multiple positions along the back for both club and country -- he could even play as a right-sided center back if necessary -- and that has been enough to get him back in the 26.

It has been quite a 2025 for Freeman, who broke into the Orlando City lineup, made his national team debut in June, and finished on a high, scoring twice against Uruguay. Pochettino has been an admirer throughout Freeman's ascension up the international ranks, and the performance against La Celeste has created some separation between Freeman and his competition.

At this point, Arfsten is the only out-and-out left back on the roster, although Dest and Timothy Weah are plenty capable of lining up there. The Columbus Crew defender continues to show steady improvement on the defensive end of the field, and his ability to get forward and deliver crosses into the box remains a strength.

Adams was another player to miss out on the November window, in his case because of a head injury, but he continues to play at a high level for Bournemouth, where his range and tackling are vital. The same is true with the U.S. team, where his leadership, both on and off the field, cements his status within the squad.

On the surface, McKennie appears to be doing everything right. Despite the revolving door of managers at Juventus, the U.S. midfielder has forced his way into the starting XI on a consistent basis, with his versatility proving invaluable. His goal in the Champions League against Bodo/Glimt is just one example.

That Pochettino opted to leave McKennie at home for November so he could prove himself to new manager Luciano Spalletti makes some sense, but it also leaves one to wonder just how secure McKennie's spot is. Where he plays with the U.S. is an open question as well.

Roldan continues to impress in a U.S. shirt, and his relentless work against Paraguay helped tilt the game to the advantage of the U.S. There remain midfielders in the pool with more international experience than Roldan (thinking Johnny Cardoso and Yunus Musah here), but Roldan has proved himself to Pochettino, and even if everyone is healthy, it won't be a surprise to see the Seattle midfielder called up in March.

Morris' on-field value has risen in the past two months in what is an extremely competitive pool of midfielders. He's also a mainstay with a Middlesbrough side that has cooled off a bit -- and changed managers -- but still finds itself in third place in the English Championship. Pochettino appreciates the grind, and as long as Morris continues to compete on that front, he should keep his spot with the USMNT.

Tessmann is another who has seen his stock rise since his omission for the September window. His performance against Paraguay saw his influence increase as the game progressed, and he even chipped in with a goal as a substitute against Uruguay. Tessmann's recent performances for Lyon have drawn less-than-stellar reviews, but he seems back in Pochettino's good graces, and steady playing time with his club should see him remain in the U.S. fold come March.

The hamstring injury Pulisic sustained during the October window lingered into November, meaning he missed out on the two recent victories. Yet Pulisic has regained his sharpness quickly and delivered in a critical moment, scoring the only goal in Milan's 1-0 win over city rival Inter Milan. As much as Pochettino says no one is guaranteed a spot, Pulisic figures to be the exception to the rule, that is, if he remains healthy and keeps delivering for his club.

Herculez Gomez speaks after Christian Pulisic's winner for AC Milan vs. Inter Milan in Serie A.

Weah continues to gain steady playing time for Marseille, with his ability to play multiple positions an asset in that regard. It remains to be seen where Weah will line up for the U.S., although don't be surprised if a wingback role is where he ultimately lands, especially if that area of the field continues to be affected by injuries. But the U.S. will be well served if he is deployed farther up the field.

Tillman has continued to make his mark with Leverkusen and scored the third goal in last weekend's 3-1 win over Wolfsburg, which saw the club take over second place in the Bundesliga. He also delivered a complete performance in the 2-0 victory over Manchester City in the Champions League. He has excelled in an attacking midfield role for the U.S. and looked sharp in the 1-1 draw against Ecuador in October. That figures to be where he'll compete for playing time, and if he continues to shine for one of Germany's better sides, he'll be on the final roster.

Luna appeared to be leveling out in September, but he has made the most of his minutes in October and November, even contributing a goal in the win over Uruguay. That ability to finish plays had been missing from some of his other performances of late, so that goal will help his chances. His ability to make the final roster might be dependent on how many strikers Pochettino ends up taking. If the manager goes with three, Luna is likely to make it. If Pochettino opts for four, Luna might be the odd man out.

Zendejas' September boost from a man-of-the-match performance against Japan gave way to some injuries in October and November, allowing other players to step forward. Zendejas is probably still ahead of Luna in the pecking order, given what is asked of him at Club América, but he'll need to make the most of Liga MX playing through the winter months to cement his spot.

Reyna won the "Man Who Came In From the Cold" award during the November window thanks to some impressive performances, especially against Uruguay. But his task isn't done. He needs to get on the field consistently for Gladbach, something he hasn't yet quite achieved. The upcoming months, even with the Bundesliga's winter break, will be a time for Reyna to solidify his standing for his club. If that happens, a similar rise at international level will follow.

Balogun remains in the lead for the starting striker spot, scoring the winner against Paraguay, his third goal for the U.S. since Sept. 1. The U.S. attack also looks more fluid when Balogun is on the field because of his ability to get behind defenses and link up with teammates. Matters have improved at the club level as well, with his minutes at Monaco steadily increasing.

If there was one player who took a step back during the November window, it was Pepi, who squandered a glorious late chance against Paraguay, and overall played less than either Balogun or Haji Wright. That would appear to leave an opening for any member of the chasing pack behind him. There also seems to be no dislodging of Guus Til from the starting lineup at PSV. There's still time, of course, but Pepi is another player needing to make the most of the winter months ahead.

Wright wasn't at his best for the U.S. in November, but his two-goal performance against Australia was recent enough to give him a solid grip on a roster spot. His once-torrid scoring pace at the club level has eased a bit as well, so he'll need to continue to deliver as Coventry push for automatic promotion.

Alas for Celentano, the last memory people will have of 2025 is Inter Miami sticking four past the Cincy keeper in the MLS Cup playoffs. Celentano's overall season was much more impressive than that, and he's still in the running for a spot, but for him to make it, he'll need to have the form of some of his competitors fall off.

Steffen is among those hurt the most by the lack of a January camp in 2026. It was last January that his national team career appeared to be revived, but some injuries have been his undoing. Now he faces an uphill climb to get back on Pochettino's radar and make a case for inclusion.

Blackmon can't catch a break. A knee injury meant that he missed much of Vancouver's playoff run, and now a red card against LAFC means he'll miss the Western Conference final. His capable performance against Japan in September seems like a long time ago, and he now faces a tough slog to get back into Pochettino's rotation.

Banks continues to get minutes in the Bundesliga for Augsburg, having appeared in the club's past seven league games; heady stuff for an 18-year-old. Banks has the look of a young John Brooks, the good and the not-so-good of that. He has terrific size and is calm on the ball, but sometimes loses concentration, which can lead to critical mistakes. But he has shown growth and was called in for the September window. Still, it seems like a cycle too early for Banks to have an impact at the international level.

Carter-Vickers' scheduled return in March from an Achilles injury seemed optimistic from the start, and last week Celtic interim manager Martin O'Neill confirmed that the U.S. defender was out for the season. Adding to the sobering assessment was O'Neill's statement that the player wouldn't touch grass until April. It's a tough blow for Carter-Vickers, and one that probably will result in him missing out on a second consecutive World Cup.

Robinson's placement in the "bubble" category has nothing to do with ability. If that was the only criteria, he'd be a near lock for the final roster. But Robinson's continued struggles with a knee injury that required surgery last May is alarming. Pochettino waits for no one, but hopefully a March return is in the works, at which point we can see how far away from top form Robinson is.

Tolkin has shown well on those occasions when he has played, and showed he could take plenty of abuse against Uruguay. Given that the pool of left backs is wafer thin at the moment, Tolkin isn't completely out of the picture, but given how players such as Dest, Scally and Weah can operate on the opposite wing, the odds still seem long for Tolkin to make the final roster.

Wiley was making progress for a spell, but a recurrence of a back injury has meant that the outside back hasn't suited up for the Hornets in over a month. With other players such as Arfsten continuing to impress Pochettino, it will take some doing to even get back on the U.S. manager's radar.

Cardoso is back healthy, and even put in a 59-minute stint in Atléti's 2-1 win over Inter Milan in the Champions League on Wednesday. It's a welcome development given that it was Cardoso's first appearance since Aug. 30, but the reality at international level is that other U.S. players have leaped over him on the USMNT depth chart. Wednesday was a start, but it will take more than just one UCL performance to change Cardoso's fortunes.

Musah's loan move to Atalanta hasn't come close to working out, at least so far. A change in manager from Ivan Juric to Raffaele Palladino has resulted in U.S. international mostly riding the bench, although he did see the field as a substitute in his side's 3-0 Champions League win over Eintracht Frankfurt. In fact, Musah has logged more minutes in league play this season with previous club AC Milan (90) than he has with Atalanta (55). Unless that changes, there doesn't appear to be a way into the USMNT for Musah.

De la Torre is another player who has slid down the depth chart. Although he received plenty of playing time with San Diego for much of the season, by season's end, he had been used as a sub and hadn't started a game in two months. Meanwhile, the likes of Berhalter and Roldan have moved past him. Time is running out for De la Torre.

To be clear, Berhalter has made the most of his opportunities, none more so than in the aforementioned demolition of Uruguay, when he scored a goal and assisted on another. His service on set pieces is arguably the best in the pool. The fact that he's in the running at all is a testament to his growth and tenacity. But if players such as Adams and McKennie return to the fold -- which seems likely -- it looks as if Berhalter will be on the outside looking in. That said, he should remain on standby.

Mauricio Pochettino talks about his USMNT squad ahead of their clash vs. Paraguay.

Aaronson's World Cup hopes seemed to be at a low ebb, considering he barely played in the Gold Cup, as well as the October window. But a solid 80-minute stint against Paraguay revived his push to make a second consecutive World Cup roster. There is still a passel of players that he needs to climb over, but he's back in Pochettino's thoughts with plenty of potential games with Leeds United to make his case.

If Pochettino opts to take four forwards to the World Cup, Agyemang is the likely beneficiary. His size would give the U.S. a different look, the kind of player who could brute force a goal if the situation demanded. His link play is improving as well, and he seems to have adapted to life in the English Championship. The question is: Will Pochettino take that extra forward? His recent rosters would suggest not, but it's still possible.

Sargent and Norwich City are in free fall in the English Championship. Sargent hasn't scored since Aug. 30, and the Canaries are now mired in the relegation zone. The fact that he hasn't scored for the U.S. since 2019 works against him as well. None of this is a recipe for getting an international call-up.

Downs is still seeking his first goal in England's second tier, although he remains in the Saints' rotation in a substitute role. Given Agyemang's relative success with Derby, it will take a special confluence of circumstances -- injuries -- to get him back in Pochettino's reckoning.

The 2025 schedule for the U.S. women's national team will finally come to a close this week. A year of intentional rotation and experimentation under the guidance of head coach Emma Hayes will get one more camp before reaching its conclusion, and there are still two more games to evaluate. 

With a focus on expanding the player pool and establishing program principles with less experienced players, the squad has navigated a year with plenty of lessons. The Stars and Stripes have a 10-3-0 record heading into their two-game series against Italy. Their three losses came against Brazil, Portugal, and Japan, and the USWNT will try to avoid any additional losses as the program hasn't lost more than three games in a year since 2001. 

It's been almost 15 years since the U.S. and Italy faced each other, and while the USWNT have a winning record against the Italians (11-1-4), this is a European side still surging from their 2025 UEFA Euro semifinals appearance. 

Here's how to watch the upcoming match:

Date: Friday, Nov. 28 | Time: 7 p.m. ETLocation: Inter & Co Stadium -- Orlando, Fla.TV: TNT

The USWNT capped off the fall season with a three-match window in October that included a shocking loss to Portugal, an immediate rematch for revenge, and a thrashing of New Zealand that reminded everyone about the squad's ability. The October friendlies were the first for the group since July, and after 113 days away from the pitch, naturally, there was some rust. Emma Hayes and the roster did a good job of recognizing the limitations of their isolated play in the earlier match, and by the time the window was over, it was back to hard decisions for Hayes moving forward. 

With so many players in and out of the talent pool, Hayes has earned her wish of wanting the hard coaching decisions. Now, with the final international window of the year, the staff will be intentional with future camp rosters with World Cup qualifying for the region in November 2026. 

Ahead of the Italy matches, Hayes named a 26-player roster. The group is a solid mix of veterans, with the return of some familiar faces, and promising young talents. 

Chelsea FC defender Naomi Girma returns to the roster after a lengthy absence due to a lingering calf injury. Rose Lavelle is also among the veteran core of players but returns to camps fresh off winning the 2025 NWSL Championship. She is one of seven players who participated in the league's biggest game of the year, alongside Gotham FC teammates Lilly Reale, Emily Sonnett, Jaedyn Shaw, and Jaelin Howell. Kate Wiesner and Croix Bethune represent Washington Spirit as runners-up.

Hayes is still following the trend that she set with more first-time call-ups and players who are on the brink of debuts. Bay FC goalkeeper Jordan Silkowitz earned a call-up after an eyes ocket fracture to Phallon Tullis-Joyce kept the Manchester United starter unavailable for selection. Chicago Stars FC forward Jameese Joseph earned her first senior team call-up after making U-23 rosters nearly all year. 

Defensive midfielder Howell marks her USWNT return for the first time since October 2022. She had a career season with Gotham FC and capped it off with a shiny new NWSL Championship trophy. Howell joined the NWSL in 2022 from Florida State University after being drafted No. 2 overall (behind Girma) as a two-time Mac Hermann Trophy winner, with some early comparisons to Julie Ertz as a more bruising type midfielder. 

She made her senior team debut in 2020 and spent some time in camps till 2022, though during her early years as a pro, she had to manage a string of injuries that kept her on the sidelines for both club and country. Now, her fourth year in NWSL, she's put together a standout season where she led the club in recoveries (172), tackles (84), and interceptions (51). She also finished second in total touches (1772) and third in goals scored (four). 

Howell has finally combined the right club with a healthy season for success. She's also worked alongside USWNT stalwarts in Lavelle and Sonnett the entire year, and the payoff is a return to the USWNT.

"I always knew she was a phenomenal player, but watching [Rose] work in the middle and having her help me, what I learned from her, just watching her in practice or on the field, and what she teaches me, when she's talking to me. has just been a huge game changer for my career," Howell told CBS Sports. 

"Having her in the middle and then having Sonnett behind me, instructing me, they've just been two totally huge game changers for me as a player this year. They've been huge. I give a lot of credit to them for being back in camp, just learning from them, me asking questions to them. I think just helping everybody on Gotham, just coaching us up on the field. And experience, with us leaning into them. I try to tell them all the time how much it's meant to me, but I'll continue to say it just because I think that they're not only great players, but great teammates, who try to help everybody around them. Specifically me. Obviously, playing in between them has been huge for me this year."

The final matches of the year against a top European opponent will be a perfect measuring stick for the USWNT's growth. The Italians are currently ranked 12th by FIFA, and their inspirational run to the UEFA Women's Euro semifinals wasn't a success that happened overnight. Though they're ascending at the moment, games against the USWNT will be a challenge for their program as well, and head coach Andrea Soncin will want to test his defense against the dynamic attacking USWNT.

Getting Cristiano Ronaldo off is a genuine disgrace – but Gianni Infantino has plenty of form for being an awful, narcissistic dick.

Infantino is approaching a decade as FIFA president, in which time he has shown himself to be a shameless, power-hungry sycophant.

We've picked out seven times he showed his true colours. There are many more, but the internet is only so big.

Let's start with the most recent act of bastardry…

 

Infantino would doubtless claim he had nothing to do with Ronaldo being reprieved to allow him to feature in Portugal's first two matches at the World Cup finals. But his slimy tentacles will extend to the FIFA disciplinary committee which, almost without precedent – certainly a relevant one – suspended two-thirds of the Portugal superstar's suspension for violent conduct.

Let's not forget, his elbow into Dara O'Shea's ribs and the subsequent cry-arsing as he left the stage in Dublin was completely blatant. It gave FIFA and Infantino a problem, because we couldn't possibly have a World Cup without Ronaldo front and centre at every available opportunity, could we?

How did they wriggle out of it? By blowing the dust off Article 27 of their disciplinary code, allowing them to suspend most of Ronaldo's ban while him and Infantino indulged in a spot of mutual back-scratching.

A one-game suspension saw Ronaldo miss the final qualifier against Armenia – Portugal coped by winning 9-1, offering further evidence that they might be a more fluid side without the 40-year-old – freeing him up instead to escort Infantino to perhaps the worst dinner party imaginable in the White House, with Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and a cast of other truly dreadful people.

Whaddya know, less than a week after rubbing the grubbiest of shoulders, Ronaldo was off the hook. Which absolutely f***ing stinks. Especially for Roberto Martinez.

 

In the run up to the World Cup, Infantino has been so far up Trump's rectum that the president can taste the FIFA chief's bald balm.

The sycophancy has been horrifyingly shameless. It was bad enough when, in August, Infantino took the World Cup trophy to the White House and, talking in a tone usually reserved for spoilt children or despotic autocrats, passed it to the US president.

“Only the FIFA president, presidents of countries, and then those who win can touch it, because it's for winners only. And since you are a winner, of course you can as well touch it.”

“Can I keep it?” replied Trump, almost certainly not joking.

As face-cavingly cringeworthy as that exchange was, Infantino took the toadying to a whole new level last month.

While his new BFF was bitching about not winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Infantino again took the approach he might with an overindulged toddler. He grabbed the shiniest object to hand and presented it to Trump as the first ever, made-up-on-the-spot FIFA Peace Prize.

“In an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it's fundamental to recognise the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace,” Infantino said. “Football stands for peace, and on behalf of the entire global football community, this prize will recognise the enormous efforts of those individuals who unite people, bringing hope for future generations.”

Thank Christ Infantino wasn't around in 1936.

 

Infantino has shown he is happy to expand his tournaments and bend their rules to make sure his bezzie mates don't miss out. But even when those nefarious methods don't work, he'll bring them anyway.

“Congratulations on your wonderful 2024 Supporters' Shield success!” Infantino exclaimed to Inter Miami at the end of the MLS 2024 regular season. “You have shown that in the United States, you are consistently the best club on the field of play. Therefore, I am proud to announce that as one of the best clubs in the world, you are deserved participants in the new FIFA Club World Cup 2025 as the host club representing the United States.”

A lot to unpack there. Seattle Sounders were already representing the home nation on merit. And Inter Miami were not the best team in the US last season. A fact proven when they immediately fell at the first hurdle in the MLS play-offs. As winners of the MLS Cup, crowned on the same weekend as the Club World Cup draw, LA Galaxy were.

But Lionel Messi doesn't play for the Galaxy. And like Ronaldo at the World Cup, regardless of merit, Messi simply had to be a headliner at Infantino Fest 2025.

 

It's been a while, a little over three years, so remind yourself of the chops on this fella on the eve of the Qatar World Cup…



If it's not convenient to watch the video, or you don't trust yourself not to destroy your device once you have, let us relay his opening remarks, after which most of those present were too busy choking on their own vomit to listen on.

Today I have very strong feelings. Today I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arab. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel a migrant worker.

I feel like them because I know what it feels like to be discriminated, to be bullied as a foreigner in a country. At school I was bullied because I had red hair and freckles. I was bullied, plus I was Italian, so imagine.

Yeah, imagine… imagine the level of c*ntiness necessary to compare his experiences as a wee ginger to those of the properly persecuted.

From there, he went on to accuse critics of Qatar's human rights record of hypocrisy and the media of racism for, among other things, exposing that some ‘fans' were paid props on the set of the most gratuitous sportswashing project to date.

It would have been funny if it wasn't so tragic. Literally, for many migrant workers.

Not content with making the World Cup a 427-team competition, Infantino wants to make it a biannual event. Not because he's a creepy megalomaniac, but because it will stop migrants dying in the ocean, apparently…

“This topic is not about whether we want a World Cup every two years, but about what do we want to do for the future of football. If we think about rest of world and the vast majority of Europe, then we have to think about what football brings. Football is about opportunity, about hope, about the national teams. We cannot say to the rest of world give us your money, but watch us on TV. We need to include them.

“We need to find ways to include the whole world to give hope to Africans so that they don't need to cross the Mediterranean in order to find maybe a better life but, more probably, death in the sea.

“We need to give opportunities, to give dignity. Not by charity but by allowing the rest of the world to participate. Maybe the World Cup every two years is not the answer.”

No, no it's not. For many, many good reasons. None, though, that might make a cretinous egotist take a pause.

 

Infantino has made a habit of sticking his pristine-white size 9s right in it when it comes to what many with a smidgen of self-awareness might consider a thorny issue around Africans and death…

For in 2023, before a deferent crowd in Kigali while sweeping unelected to a third term as president – no wonder Trump relates – Infantino took the acclaim before likening his rise to the top of FIFA with Rwanda's recovery from genocide.

Infantino said his personal mission to drive the FIFA gravy train was inspired by a visit to the African country's memorial to the horrors of summer 1994 when 800,000 people were slaughtered in 100 days.

“I said, ‘Who am I to give up,'” he recalled. “What this country has suffered and how this country came back up is inspiring for the entire world. So, I certainly couldn't give up because someone was telling me something. I stayed, I continued to campaign, I was elected FIFA president.”

Truly, this pr*ck's narcissism knows no bounds.

 

Remember when Infantino formed half of 2022's hottest power couple – him and that steak shagger?

That was weird.

Is it as simple as Liverpool being so rotten because they are grieving Diogo Jota? There is an argument that no coach could combat that.


It seems Jurgen Klopp has already given Liverpool two names to replace Arne Slot and one of them is Steven Gerrard.


Are Liverpool about to sack Arne Slot? They actually really might be after that absolute sh*t-show against PSV.


Liverpool fans are split about whether Arne Slot should still be the manager, but they are united in thinking change must come.

Ale Moreno tells Herc Gomez that MLS should avoid the "headache" that comes with bringing in Neymar. (2:09)

Wind the film back to the end of January. Estêvão, with four brief substitute appearances under his belt, was a promise and a possibility for Brazil's 2026 World Cup squad. Neymar, meanwhile, was a certainty. The one-time boy prince was returning to Santos, where the story started, and his old club was going to give him a platform to round off the narrative with one final attempt at World Cup glory.

Fast forward 10 months, and things have turned out very differently. Estêvão is going from strength to strength and was given his first Brazil start in Carlo Ancelotti's debut match in charge. He is making an extreme case to be an integral part of the World Cup team, helping himself to five goals between September and November.

And the wonder strike -- off his weak foot -- in Tuesday's 3-0 win over Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League merely reinforces the point that Chelsea would seem to have signed the most brilliant talent to come out of Brazil since ... Neymar.

- Source: Neymar wants to play on despite pain
- Estêvão has Chelsea looking deserving 'world champions' tag
- Can Vinícius Júnior find a spark to his season by playing for Brazil?

The original wonderkid, meanwhile, has had a 2025 to forget, rounded off by the news on Tuesday that a knee injury may well keep him out of the last three games of the season. With Santos in the relegation zone, that is bad news for him and bad news for the club.

The expectations were probably always too high for a couple of reasons.

First, there is the extraordinary, nigh on miraculous, history of Santos. In the late 1950s and through the early 1960s, Pelé and his wonderful supporting cast formed arguably the greatest team in the world, and certainly the most easy on the eye. Excellent youth development brought back the glory years in the 21st century, and lightning appeared to have struck twice when a baby-faced Neymar emerged and led them to the Copa Libertadores in 2011.

But this history can be something of a burden for a club representing a city of under half a million, tiny by the standards of Brazil's big clubs. As financial gaps have opened up, it has become harder for Santos to compete. In 2023, the first season since Pelé's passing, they suffered their first-ever relegation to the second division. They bounced straight back, and the hope was that the return of Neymar would add plenty more positive momentum. Some saw them as possible title contenders, but they were aiming too high.

This is especially true since Neymar was still trying to shake off the effects of a serious knee injury he suffered while playing for Brazil in October 2023. He was free to go back to Brazil after Jorge Jesus, his coach at Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, refused to register him for the club's league campaign. He simply was not fit enough, said the coach.

At the beginning of 2025, Neymar was an unknown quantity as a footballer. And if that was true at the end of January, it remains the case in late November. Judging him as a player still seems harsh; he has never been able to put together a sequence of games that would enable him to get up to full match fitness.

After such a long layoff, muscular problems were to be expected, and he broke down in April after a couple of early rounds of the Brazilian Serie A.

There were two more games before the pause for the Club World Cup, and then a two-month, nine-game sequence when the action resumed in July. He was then out for another six weeks before returning early this month, but then, worryingly, given the original problem, he went down with a knee injury that threatens to end his season.

But when has he played? In those 17 rounds (of 35 played so far) in which he has been on the field, how has he done? Neymar has not lost the ability to see and to execute a pass that opens up the field and his proficiency as a striker of a dead ball remains. But the standout feature of peak Neymar was his skill as a dribbler, his talent to change direction and improvise solutions at top pace.

This has not been seen, as he has found it hard to get away from his marker. And without this, it has not been easy for Santos' coaches to find a way to make him useful. A low point was the 6-0 defeat to Vasco da Gama in August. The lesson -- and it cost coach Cleber Xavier his job -- was that it was not feasible to play Neymar, a center forward and two wingers. With no balance between attack and defence, Vasco carved Santos to pieces.

The solution found by the new boss, Juan Pablo Vojvoda, has been to use Neymar as a free-roaming center forward, left upfield to avoid defensive responsibilities, and also able to drop and organize the play from deep.

This arrangement has had its moments, like when he scored in the last game he played, against Mirassol. But for Brazil's all-time top scorer, three league goals is a disappointing return and very frustrating.

This has been a keynote of Neymar's return, the sense of frustration that frequently comes close to boiling over.

Stewart Robson and Craig Burley discuss Estêvão's performance vs. Barcelona and his contribution in Chelsea's attack.

It might have been hoped that the time away from the pitch would have focused his mind on ways that he needed to change to reach his immense potential. Instead, he seems at war with everyone. With the referee (of course), with his opponents, and, earlier this month, with his own teammates.

Against Flamengo, he strutted around the Maracanã pitch, blaming everyone and anyone for the opposition's 3-0 lead. He threw a mini-fit when he was substituted -- and it came across as poetic justice -- when, in his absence, Santos pulled two goals back.

This was extremely disappointing from a player who, whatever the public perception, has usually been very popular in the various dressing rooms he has been a part of. But now, if he really is ruled out of the last three games of the season, he needs his teammates to come to his rescue.

What happens if Santos are relegated? It is far from clear that the club could afford to keep Neymar, as there are already grumblings about his cost and benefit. But there is surely no way that he could play his way back into the Brazil squad from the second division. He would presumably be forced to hurriedly fix himself up with another club.

The career of Neymar has been full of the kind of twists and turns that he once performed in his exhilarating dribbles. Another one is called for now if he is not to spend the 2026 World Cup on the sidelines, watching the twists and turns of Estêvão.

The top of the table clash between Arsenal and Chelsea on Sunday has the potential to blow the Premier League title race wide open. 

Alternatively, it could leave it in danger of turning into a procession. 

Arsenal, six points clear at the top, heads to Stamford Bridge on a wave of optimism and a growing belief it will end its long wait for a first league title since 2004. With a squad regarded as possibly the strongest in Europe, Mikel Arteta's team is undefeated in 16 games in all competitions, with 14 wins on that run. 

After three straight years as runner up, it feels like Arsenal's time has come and Wednesday's demolition of European powerhouse Bayern Munich was further evidence of its credentials to win the biggest prizes, not only the title but perhaps the Champions League as well. 

With defending champion Liverpool in freefall and Manchester City also off the pace, it could be Arsenal's title to lose. 

The closest challenger is second-place Chelsea, winner of the Club World Cup in July and with a squad that cost more than $1 billion. But it is possibly ahead of the curve in terms of mounting a serious title charge.

Coach Enzo Maresca is only in his second season in the Premier League and has a squad packed with inexperience, but Chelsea produced its standout performance of the campaign to beat Barcelona 3-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday.

The clash with Arsenal will be the sternest test yet of its title credentials. 

While Chelsea vs. Arsenal is the biggest match of the weekend, there are key clashes elsewhere for teams hoping to stay in touch at the top. 

City can temporarily move up to second with a win against Leeds while Liverpool, on the back of six losses in seven in the league, is at West Ham. 

Brazil forward Estevao has quickly established himself at Chelsea and has been one of the most exciting players this season, with nine goals in his last 13 games for club and country. That included his outstanding strike against Barcelona this week and his late winner against Liverpool last month. 

Hugo Ekitike was substituted in Liverpool's game against PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday because of a back complaint. 

Matheus Cunha missed Manchester United's defeat against Everton because of what was described as a knock in training. Benjamin Sesko is out with a knee injury.

Leandro Trossard limped off in the first half of Arsenal's game against Bayern, with Arteta saying afterwards he did not know the extent of the injury. 

Liverpool's title defense is at crisis point, with growing scrutiny on coach Arne Slot after a run of nine defeats in 12 games in all competitions. 

Slot said he was still “feeling safe” after the latest loss, but it is clear he needs to turn Liverpool's form around after its damaging run. 

The pressure could mount further if Liverpool slips up again at an upwardly mobile West Ham.

Neymar has been spotted in Santos training despite reportedly being told by club doctors that he risks worsening his injury. The Brazil icon has a knee issue that will rule him out for the rest of the season if he has surgery. But with the Brazilian outfit in the midst of a relegation battle, the 33-year-old may try and play through the pain to secure his team top-flight safety.

The former Barcelona star has had an injury-hit season, with the veteran only recently returning to action from a hamstring problem. This week, it emerged that Neymar had been struggling with knee discomfort, ruling him out of their 1-1 draw with Internacional on Monday. They currently sit one place above the relegation zone (17th) in the Brasileiro Serie A with three matches remaining. Shortly after picking up that valuable point, Santos manager Juan Pablo Vojvoda revealed what the club have planned for their "leader". 

He told reporters: "The plan is for him to be in the match against Sport. I have to talk to him, I'm not in his physical presence and I will respect Neymar's decisions. But his commitment is to be there, he always wants to be there. Before the Mirassol game, he felt discomfort in his knee. He also felt it during the game. The following day he was experiencing significant discomfort in that knee. We know we have games every three days. With travel, we'll arrive in Santos tomorrow afternoon… He's a player we need for all three rounds and he'll help us. He's our leader on the field. He'll be there. He felt he wouldn't be able to meet the demands of today's game."

Footage from Santos has shown that Neymar trained with his team-mates on Wednesday but it is clear he is not at 100 per cent. According to Globo, he has a tear in the meniscus region of his left knee and the medical recommendation is to have an arthroscopy - a minimally invasive surgical procedure that involves inserting a small camera into a joint through a tiny incision. This allows the surgeon to see inside the joint on a video monitor and perform necessary repairs. This injury is said to be causing Neymar 'persistent pain' when exercising but he is considering playing 'in the sacrifice' of Santos. 

The report adds that Neymar's knee 'can burst at any major impact' and the doctors are advising that he stop playing/training and undergo an arthroscopy. However, that would end his season, with the Brazilian likely to be out for a month as a result. Incidentally, when Neymar took part in team training, he avoided contact, and he played with support on his left knee. The fear is that if he doesn't rest his knee, this issue could become a lot worse, potentially ruling him out for the start of 2026 and jeopardising his chances of a Brazil national team call-up in March. Despite that, Neymar is reportedly mulling over what to do, as a potential return to the second division beckons.

The former Paris Saint-Germain star, who joined Santos at the start of 2025 after having his Al-Hilal contract cancelled, has had a mixed second spell at his boyhood club so far. The ex-Barca ace has been on the sidelines for lengthy periods and a return of seven goals and three assists in 25 matches in all competitions is nothing special. Moreover, he is out of contract at the end of the year, so if he does have the procedure, Neymar may not play for the club again. While Santos are keen to keep him, that will only likely be possible if they stay in the Brazilian top-flight. Next up, they host Sport Recife on Friday, who are rock bottom of the division. This is, arguably, a must-win game for Santos, particularly as Fortaleza have won two matches in a row and are just one point behind the Brazilian giants. It's crunch time for Santos and Neymar.

The 2025 cadet championship is poised to crown a new winner, and Flashscore takes a closer look at how European teams have performed in past finals.

Portugal will face Austria in the final of the 2025 FIFA U17 World Cup at the Khalifa International Stadium. 

A second-half brace from Johannes Moser fired Austria past Italy, while reigning European champions Portugal edged four-time world champions Brazil on penalties to book their place in the showpiece.

Beyond the fireworks expected in Qatar's football cathedral, what makes this final truly special is that the tournament is set to crown a brand-new champion.

As anticipation grows for what promises to be a thrilling contest, this piece takes a closer look at Europe's long and varied history in U17 World Cup finals.

Europe's first appearance in a FIFA U17 World Cup final came in the inaugural tournament in China. West Germany, led by the prolific Marcel Witeczek, who had scored back-to-back hat-tricks in the quarter-final and semi-final, advanced to face a relatively unknown Nigerian side that had edged Guinea in the last four.

Despite the Germans' firepower, the Golden Eaglets stunned the favourites in the final at Beijing's Workers' Stadium. 

Nigeria produced a fearless performance, sealing a historic 2–0 victory with goals from Jonathan Akpoborie and Victor Igbinoba.

In Canada, Europe won their first U17 World Cup title when the Soviet Union defeated defending champions Nigeria at the University of Toronto's Varsity Stadium. 

The match was a repeat of their group-stage meeting, which ended 1–1, but this time Aleksandr Piskaryov's team came out on top. 

Yuriy Nikiforov put the Soviets ahead in the sixth minute, but Nigeria hit back five minutes later with a fine goal from Philip Osondu. With neither side able to find a winner in normal or extra time, the final went to penalties, where the Soviet Union scored four kicks to the Africans' two to claim the trophy.

Europe reached the U17 World Cup final for the third consecutive edition when hosts Scotland made it through, but the Scots were unable to replicate the Soviet Union's title-winning form from two years earlier. 

Fuelled by a 1-0 semi-final win over Portugal, Scotland took an early lead in the final at Hampden Park, Glasgow, with Ian Downie scoring in the seventh minute, followed by Paul Dickov doubling the advantage in the 25th minute.

However, Saudi Arabia came back strongly in the second half, with Alreshoudi Sulaiman scoring in the 49th minute and Waleed Al Terair equalizing in the 65th.

In the decisive penalty shootout, Dickov and Brian O'Neil missed their kicks, allowing Saudi Arabia to stun the football world and become the first Asian nation to lift the FIFA U17 World Cup.

Europe's hopes of claiming the U17 World Cup were dashed as Spain fell to Ghana in the final held in Florence. 

Both teams had entered the decider unbeaten, having previously played out a 1-1 draw in the group stage, with Pepe Galvez cancelling Nana Opoku's opener. 

The final promised a historic first title for either side, but in a grueling encounter, it was the Africans who had the edge. Emmanuel Duah's decisive 77th-minute strike proved the difference, securing Black Starlets' victory and leaving Spain's dream of U17 glory unfulfilled.

After a 12-year absence from the U17 World Cup final, Europe returned in style as France claimed the title, overwhelming Musa Abdullahi's Nigeria at Hasely Crawford Stadium in Port of Spain. 

The final was a rematch of their group stage encounter, where the Golden Eaglets had edged Les Bleus 2-1, with Florent Sinama Pongolle's goal unable to overturn strikes from Karimu Shuaibu and Victor Brown. 

This time, French team dominated, with Sinama Pongolle, Anthony Le Tallec, and Samuel Pietre all finding the net to secure Europe's second U17 World Cup triumph. 

Spain came close to claiming the tournament in Finland, but a decisive goal from Leonardo gave Brazil a 1-0 victory in Helsinki. 

The only goal arrived just seven minutes in when Brazilian captain Joao curled a 20-metre free-kick against the post, leaving Leonardo to tap in from close range. 

Spain created several promising chances but were repeatedly denied by goalkeeper Bruno, who was in superb form. The final held at Helsinki's Toolo Stadium, was also the first FIFA U-17 final played on artificial turf. 

It was another heartbreak for Europe as Spain fell to Nigeria in the final. After a thrilling 0-0 stalemate through extra time, the title was decided on penalties, where Nigeria triumphed 3-0 at the Seoul World Cup Stadium.

Goalkeeper Oladele Ajiboye emerged as the hero, saving two crucial spot-kicks and securing the Golden Eaglets' third U-17 crown, following their wins in China (1985) and Japan (1993). 

Matthew Edile, Daniel Joshua, and Ganiyu Oseni converted for Nigeria, while Spain's Asier Illaramendi missed, and Fran Merida and Iago had their penalties saved.

Debutants Switzerland stunned hosts Nigeria with a 1-0 victory to claim the world title in Abuja. Haris Seferovic's 63rd-minute header proved decisive, securing the Europeans' first-ever World Cup title at any level. 

The Swiss, who had won every match in the tournament, held off late Eaglets chances with Nasim Ben Khalifa and Pajtim Kasami holding sway in the midfield.

Europe celebrated as the Swiss lifted the trophy with Spain completing the continent's strong showing by defeating Colombia 1-0 in the third-place match.

England made history in the first all-European U-17 World Cup final by defeating Spain 5-2 in Kolkata.

In the seven-goal thriller, the Spaniards had taken a two-goal lead through early goals from Sergio Gomez in the 10th and 31st minutes, having previously beaten England on penalties in the UEFA U-17 Championship final. 

The English team responded before half-time with Rhian Brewster scoring, followed by Morgan Gibbs-White's equaliser. Phil Foden then scored twice around a Marc Guehi strike to seal the victory and ensured Europe claimed a fourth triumph. 

Germany won the title for the first time after a dramatic 4-3 penalty shootout win over France in Surakarta, marking the second all-European final in the U17 World Cup history. 

Paris Brunner and Noah Darvich had given Germany a two-goal lead, but the French fought back through Saimon Bouabre and an 85th-minute equaliser from Mathis Amougou.

During kicks from the penalty mark, goalkeeper Konstantin Heide saved two penalties to secure the shootout victory to cement Europe's growing dominance at youth level.

A little over a year ago, Gianni Infantino announced that Inter Miami would participate in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. He said the Herons were "deserved participants", having supposedly proven themselves "the best club" in MLS. Only they hadn't. Miami may have finished top of the regular-season standings, but the play-offs had yet to get under way.

Infantino, though, couldn't run the risk of Miami failing to win the MLS Cup, so he moved quickly to capitalise on their Supporters' Shield success, using it as an excuse to justify their selection as the 'hosts' for the Club World Cup (which was a smart move, as Miami were eliminated in the first round of the MLS play-offs).

Everybody knew why Miami had really been included: Lionel Messi. Infantino was so desperate to drum up interest in the Club World Cup that he came up with a way to get the GOAT involved.

The complaints weren't particularly vociferous then, largely owing to the scheduling of the Club World Cup and it being predominantly viewed as a pre-season tournament. The World Cup, though, is something very different, something special, and supposedly something sacrosanct - which is why there has been such a bitter backlash to FIFA bending the rules to ensure that another global superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo, will be able to play in all of Portugal's matches and next summer's finals in North America.

Ronaldo promised that he was "going to try to be a good boy" before Portugal's World Cup qualifier with Ireland in Dublin on November 13 - but, with just over an hour of the game gone, and the Seleccao trailing to two unanswered goals from Troy Parrott, the frustrated forward thrust his elbow into the back of Dara O'Shea. Ronaldo was initially issued a yellow card by the match official, but it was rightly upgraded to a red following the intervention of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR).

As is always the case with Ronaldo, nothing is ever his fault, and the blame game began before he'd even made it to the tunnel at the Aviva Stadium, with the 40-year-old first insinuating that O'Shea had made too much of the incident with a crying-eyes gesture before then bizarrely blaming Ireland manager Heimir Hallgrimsson for his dismissal during a heated touchline exchange.

"He complimented me for putting pressure on the referee," revealed the Icelandic, who, in his pre-match press conference, had accused Ronaldo of influencing the officials during the two teams' meeting in Lisbon the month beforehand. "But it had nothing to do with me – unless I got into his head. This was just a moment of a little silliness from him, I would say. It was his action on the pitch that cost him the red card."

It should also have cost Ronaldo two games at next summer's World Cup.

Any red card for violent conduct usually brings with it an automatic three-match suspension, meaning Ronaldo should have been suspended not only for his country's final World Cup qualifier against Armenia, on November 16, but also their first two matches at the tournament proper. It was a clear case of serious foul play. The standard sentence should have been a formality.

However, Portugal coach Roberto Martinez initially claimed, "I think the action looks worse than what it actually is. I don't think it's an elbow but from where the camera is, it looks like an elbow." 

Then, the Spaniard would change tack, arguing that Ronaldo deserved "credit" rather than criticism for never having previously been sent off at international level.  This fact formed the basis of Portugal's argument against a three-match ban and, incredibly, it worked.

FIFA's disciplinary committee revealed on Tuesday that the final two games of Ronaldo's three-match ban had been suspended for a year - unless he "commits another infringement of a similar nature and gravity during the probationary period". In such a scenario, "the suspension set out in the disciplinary decision shall be deemed automatically revoked and the remaining two matches must be served immediately."

It was a staggering decision, completely unprecedented and yet utterly unsurprising. Indeed, what's truly depressing about the Ronaldo ruling is everybody saw it coming.

There was simply no way FIFA were going to prevent the man with the most social media followers on the planet from playing a full part in their flagship event. He's just too important to the brand, as illustrated by the presence of Ronaldo at a White House dinner last week alongside his 'boss', Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Infantino and U.S. president Donald Trump.

As a result, FIFA was seemingly left with no option but to make a mockery of its own disciplinary committee, because it would have been a lot more difficult to do commercial deals and sell match tickets without Ronaldo, the most famous face in the world, fronting every possible advertising campaign. 

FIFA's determination to stack their competitions full of stars explains why they've made it easier than ever for the nations with the biggest TV audiences to qualify for the World Cup by expanding the finals to 48 participants, thus running the risk of diluting the quality while increasing revenue streams. It's also worth remembering the failed attempt to try and shoehorn Ronaldo into the Club World Cup by having him sign for one of the participants on a short-term deal, such was the desperation for him to join Messi in gracing the tournament.

It was also telling that on the same day Ronaldo was given a reprieve, FIFA also announced that for the first time ever the top-four seeded countries at the tournament - Spain, Argentina, France and England - will be kept apart until the semi-finals if they all win their respective groups - a flagrant attempt to avoid any of the nations with the biggest fanbases from suffering an earlier-than-expected elimination (just as UEFA did with the Champions League many, many years ago).

It begs the question: If it's not broken, why fix it?

There is some scope for a national federation or player to challenge the Ronaldo ruling - or even just cite it as a precedent as they appeal against a future ban for violent conduct. Someone sent off in the World Cup play-offs could well immediately move to have their mandatory suspension overturned on the grounds of prior good behaviour.

In that sense, perhaps FIFA have opened a can of worms here that could end up making a real mess - and it is worth mentioning that the special treatment Ronaldo has received has provoked outrage among supporters all across the globe.

Despite the outcries of anger at the Ronaldo decision, that's likely to be forgotten about soon and replaced by anticipation, as the build-up begins to the greatest show on earth, starting with the group-stage draw in Washington D.C. on December 5.

FIFA have essentially ignored their own rulebook to suit themselves - and one very important player. Ronaldo now needs to hold up his end of the bargain and continue to be a 'good boy' going forward.

A little over a year ago, Gianni Infantino announced that Inter Miami would participate in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. He said the Herons were "deserved participants", having supposedly proven themselves "the best club" in MLS. Only they hadn't. Miami may have finished top of the regular-season standings, but the play-offs had yet to get under way.

Infantino, though, couldn't run the risk of Miami failing to win the MLS Cup, so he moved quickly to capitalise on their Supporters' Shield success, using it as an excuse to justify their selection as the 'hosts' for the Club World Cup (which was a smart move, as Miami were eliminated in the first round of the MLS play-offs).

Everybody knew why Miami had really been included: Lionel Messi. Infantino was so desperate to drum up interest in the Club World Cup that he came up with a way to get the GOAT involved.

The complaints weren't particularly vociferous then, largely owing to the scheduling of the Club World Cup and it being predominantly viewed as a pre-season tournament. The World Cup, though, is something very different, something special, and supposedly something sacrosanct - which is why there has been such a bitter backlash to FIFA bending the rules to ensure that another global superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo, will be able to play in all of Portugal's matches and next summer's finals in North America.

Ronaldo promised that he was "going to try to be a good boy" before Portugal's World Cup qualifier with Ireland in Dublin on November 13 - but, with just over an hour of the game gone, and the Seleccao trailing to two unanswered goals from Troy Parrott, the frustrated forward thrust his elbow into the back of Dara O'Shea. Ronaldo was initially issued a yellow card by the match official, but it was rightly upgraded to a red following the intervention of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR).

As is always the case with Ronaldo, nothing is ever his fault, and the blame game began before he'd even made it to the tunnel at the Aviva Stadium, with the 40-year-old first insinuating that O'Shea had made too much of the incident with a crying-eyes gesture before then bizarrely blaming Ireland manager Heimir Hallgrimsson for his dismissal during a heated touchline exchange.

"He complimented me for putting pressure on the referee," revealed the Icelandic, who, in his pre-match press conference, had accused Ronaldo of influencing the officials during the two teams' meeting in Lisbon the month beforehand. "But it had nothing to do with me – unless I got into his head. This was just a moment of a little silliness from him, I would say. It was his action on the pitch that cost him the red card."

It should also have cost Ronaldo two games at next summer's World Cup.

Any red card for violent conduct usually brings with it an automatic three-match suspension, meaning Ronaldo should have been suspended not only for his country's final World Cup qualifier against Armenia, on November 16, but also their first two matches at the tournament proper. It was a clear case of serious foul play. The standard sentence should have been a formality.

However, Portugal coach Roberto Martinez initially claimed, "I think the action looks worse than what it actually is. I don't think it's an elbow but from where the camera is, it looks like an elbow." 

Then, the Spaniard would change tack, arguing that Ronaldo deserved "credit" rather than criticism for never having previously been sent off at international level.  This fact formed the basis of Portugal's argument against a three-match ban and, incredibly, it worked.

FIFA's disciplinary committee revealed on Tuesday that the final two games of Ronaldo's three-match ban had been suspended for a year - unless he "commits another infringement of a similar nature and gravity during the probationary period". In such a scenario, "the suspension set out in the disciplinary decision shall be deemed automatically revoked and the remaining two matches must be served immediately."

It was a staggering decision, completely unprecedented and yet utterly unsurprising. Indeed, what's truly depressing about the Ronaldo ruling is everybody saw it coming.

There was simply no way FIFA were going to prevent the man with the most social media followers on the planet from playing a full part in their flagship event. He's just too important to the brand, as illustrated by the presence of Ronaldo at a White House dinner last week alongside his 'boss', Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Infantino and U.S. president Donald Trump.

As a result, FIFA was seemingly left with no option but to make a mockery of its own disciplinary committee, because it would have been a lot more difficult to do commercial deals and sell match tickets without Ronaldo, the most famous face in the world, fronting every possible advertising campaign. 

FIFA's determination to stack their competitions full of stars explains why they've made it easier than ever for the nations with the biggest TV audiences to qualify for the World Cup by expanding the finals to 48 participants, thus running the risk of diluting the quality while increasing revenue streams. It's also worth remembering the failed attempt to try and shoehorn Ronaldo into the Club World Cup by having him sign for one of the participants on a short-term deal, such was the desperation for him to join Messi in gracing the tournament.

It was also telling that on the same day Ronaldo was given a reprieve, FIFA also announced that for the first time ever the top-four seeded countries at the tournament - Spain, Argentina, France and England - will be kept apart until the semi-finals if they all win their respective groups - a flagrant attempt to avoid any of the nations with the biggest fanbases from suffering an earlier-than-expected elimination (just as UEFA did with the Champions League many, many years ago).

It begs the question: If it's not broken, why fix it?

There is some scope for a national federation or player to challenge the Ronaldo ruling - or even just cite it as a precedent as they appeal against a future ban for violent conduct. Someone sent off in the World Cup play-offs could well immediately move to have their mandatory suspension overturned on the grounds of prior good behaviour.

In that sense, perhaps FIFA have opened a can of worms here that could end up making a real mess - and it is worth mentioning that the special treatment Ronaldo has received has provoked outrage among supporters all across the globe.

Despite the outcries of anger at the Ronaldo decision, that's likely to be forgotten about soon and replaced by anticipation, as the build-up begins to the greatest show on earth, starting with the group-stage draw in Washington D.C. on December 5.

FIFA have essentially ignored their own rulebook to suit themselves - and one very important player. Ronaldo now needs to hold up his end of the bargain and continue to be a 'good boy' going forward.

Weston McKennie and Jonathan David are in different situations for their club and, with the World Cup around the corner, need to start playing their best soccer.

On Tuesday evening, two CONCACAF stars finally made the difference for Juventus in the Champions League. Their influence was overdue in a 3-2 win that flirted with embarrassment, but when Juve needed someone to steady the ship, first Weston McKennie and then Jonathan David delivered.

McKennie struck first, smashing home a 60th-minute equalizer against Bodo/Glimt. David followed with a stoppage-time winner that secured three points — and, frankly, spared Juve from dropping points in a game they had no business complicating. It was about time for both. McKennie remains an enigma in Turin: ever-present, yet often difficult to pinpoint in terms of tangible impact. David, meanwhile, chose a club with two established strikers and has spent the autumn trying to carve out space for himself. It's only November, but both feel like they're approaching a crossroads.

And in recent weeks, that has only gotten worse. Juve did what Italian clubs often do and fired their manager, Igor Tudor, after a poor start to the season. They then responded by hiring Luciano Spalletti, a coach of immaculate pedigree but seemingly a poor fit for the squad.

It is a puzzling situation for both. Spalletti has done little to indicate that he rates David. McKennie has been a regular, but far from the star he could perhaps be elsewhere. In short, the American and the Canadian are struggling - albeit in different ways. And at an unpredictable club quickly falling out of Serie A contention, something has to change.

Spalletti should have made sense. In truth, he still might. This is a frighteningly early time to jump to any conclusions. But what Juventus have is a Serie A–proven manager who showed he can do a lot with a little when he won the league with Napoli in 2023. That team was propelled by Victor Osimhen and a young Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, but it was also wonderfully balanced, with legs in midfield and solidity at the back. Spalletti's sides can attack, but they can also defend.

His time with the Italian national team was admittedly mixed. The talent pool had dried up, and he argued that he didn't have the time to shape the squad before Euro 2024. Italy lost in the Round of 16, and he took responsibility:

“We failed because of my team selection; it is never down to the players.”

It was expected that he might leave after the exit, but instead stuck around for another year. He was let go for good in June after losing to Norway in Italy's first World Cup qualifying fixture. 

When Juve appointed him, they hoped for the Napoli version of Spalletti. There could yet be some magic here.

The early results have been somewhat mixed. Spalletti looks very much like a coach still figuring it out - tinkering with his personnel despite having a recognized system. There is, however, one major constraint to his game. Juve's squad has been assembled to play in some version of a 3-4-3. There will, in whatever tactical vision Spalletti ultimately holds, a base construction of three central defenders, wing backs and two central midfielders. 

That's a problem. At Napoli, he used a 4-3-3 of sorts. For Italy, he tinkered but tended to favor a back four system. He has been given a squad, then, that doesn't quite fit his usual needs. That is not necessarily Spalletti's fault. Juventus have only had a director of football for five months. They are, structurally, a mess, and have appointed three managers in just over a year. He's not been given the best tools here. 

He started his reign by beating Cremonese, 2-1. That was followed by three straight draws in which Juve scored just twice. On Tuesday evening, he had his first big win. The Bianconeri conceded first against last year's Europa League darlings Bodo/Glimt and mounted a second-half comeback to seal three vital points in the Champions League. 

There have been some tactical innovations here. With too many central midfielders to get into his side - and a feeling that Khephren Thuram, Manuel Locatelli, and Teun Koopmeiners are all undroppable - Spalletti moved Koopmeiners into his back three, and tasked the midfielder with playing a crucial role in build-up play. That has certainly made his side more dynamic on the ball - yet the end product is yet to be seen. 

 What this means for McKennie, though, remains unclear. Every summer brings the same message: the American is no longer valued at Juve, a move is imminent, his time is up. And yet, somehow, he always works his way back into the fold. Sometimes out of necessity, but more often because of his quality. McKennie is a gifted, versatile footballer who should be more than a utility man, though a succession of managers have been reluctant to leave him out.

Spalletti has treated him much the same way, using the Texas native as a right-sided player in various roles. McKennie has started all five of Spalletti's games so far and has played all but five minutes. Three starts have come at right wing-back; two have come as either a winger or an advanced midfielder. And McKennie has been entirely agreeable. He does everything right without quite standing out. He hasn't scored or assisted, but he's a steady 7/10: winning more tackles than he loses, completing passes at a solid rate, and creating a couple of chances each game.

Then, on Tuesday, he came alive. Juve were struggling and trailed Bodo/Glimt 1-0 at half-time. Lois Openda pulled one back early in the second half. And McKennie came up with the next crucial moment. His go-ahead goal wasn't particularly pretty, but he timed his run perfectly and rose to meet a lofted ball. Juve went on to win 3-2.

And David also got in on the fun. It has been a frustrating few months for the former Lille man. He was linked with plenty of high-profile moves after scoring for fun in the French league. Arsenal and Liverpool were both reportedly in the mix. A few other big names were mentioned here and there. Juve, in truth, seemed an odd choice, especially given that they had Dusan Vlahovic up front. David needed to start, and it didn't seem like the club could offer him many minutes. 

So far, those doubts have proven valid. Thus far, David has started five out of 11 Serie A games, registering one goal and one assist in league play. He was bright in the first month of the season, but Spalletti has been reluctant to use him. Davif hasn't started a domestic game under the new boss, and played just four minutes against Sporting CP in the Champions League on Nov. 4. 

His underlying numbers, though, look pretty good. David is in the 90th percentile for shot-creating actions and 99th in pass completion percentage according to FBRef. His defensive numbers are as reliable as ever. These are small sample sizes, but the player is still very much there. 

And he proved it in style Tuesday evening. Juve seemed set to kick on after McKennie's second goal. But the home side grabbed an equalizer in the 87th minute. A point wouldn't have been disastrous. Still, in these games, you need all three. David's goal was all instinct. Kenan Yildiz had a shot well parried, and David floated in, reacted first, and turned home. Whether that goal kicks off his Juve career in full remains to be seen, but it was a solid moment for a struggling player.  

Canada manager Jesse Marsch said last year that David was the best striker he has ever coached. That's important, mostly because Marsch coached an admittedly young Erling Haaland. But his point was that David isn't a better goalscorer. He isn't faster. He certainly isn't as freakishly athletic. What David does have, though, is a complete package - an arsenal of weapons that can be used on and off the ball. He isn't a Haaland as much as a Roberto Firmino - the kind of false 9 adjacent player who can do a bit of everything. That is why, for all of his struggles in a Juventus shirt, he remains a key component of the Canadian National setup. And while Marsch has noted that club form is important when he pieces together his team, David's raw quality simply cannot be ignored. 

McKennie, meanwhile, is facing a less certain future. He has been given chances by Pochettino, yet failed to seize the moment under the Argentine manager. He was left out of the U.S. squad in November, with the manager pointing out he was eager for McKennie to get to know his new boss during the international break.

"These next few weeks, with the possibility for the new coach to work with the players there, I think it's important for Weston to be there and to convince the coach to keep playing [him],” said the Argentinian. "I think that's more important than to be with us, because we already know what he can provide the team."

Those words seem to suggest that McKennie's involvement in the squad itself is safe. But whether he will start remains to be seen. Unlike David, at present, he doesn't seem poised to be a regular for his country. 

What we have here, then, are two CONCACAF players facing very different situations. McKennie, for all the annual uncertainty around his future, remains a regular for Juve. Every manager he has played under has found a place for him. He isn't spectacular, but he fills gaps, does jobs, and keeps getting picked. His contract is up at the end of the season, and whether he stays is unclear - he has even been linked with MLS. Yet despite being a regular, that isn't enough to guarantee him a spot on the USMNT. 

David, meanwhile, is in the opposite scenario. He joined a Juve side heavy on strikers and without a natural false 9 role available that he could thrive in. Yet Marsch and Canada continue to rely on him for goals and assists - and will surely need him to produce if Les Rouges are to make any sort of noise at the 2026 World Cup on home soil. 

Ultimately, more broadly, this is what modern football looks like. McKennie is indispensable for club - yet in and out for country. David can barely get a kick for his club side, but is one of the first names on the teamsheet for his national team. So few are able to have both. But for a duo of teams looking to make some noise next summer, performances like that on Tuesday have to become a regularity.

'I certainly would've liked to have a 30-point gap instead of 24' - Norris on title challenge

'We'll go all in' - Verstappen aiming to make title fight 'exciting until the end' 

The award-winning global exhibition has arrived in Melbourne, offering Australian fans an unprecedented journey through 75 years of Formula 1 history.

The internationally acclaimed Formula 1 Exhibition opened in Melbourne last night with an exclusive preview event welcoming special guests, media, and motorsport personalities for an unforgettable first look at the immersive experience.

Making its Asia-Pacific debut at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre (MCEC), the F1 Exhibition opens to the public this Saturday, 29 November.

The exhibition brings one of the world's most celebrated motorsport experiences to Australia after record-breaking tours across Europe – in Madrid, Vienna, London, and Amsterdam – and successful runs in Toronto and Buenos Aires. The global showcase transforms the MCEC into an immersive exploration of Formula 1's past, present, and future.

Brought to Melbourne by Sony Music and TEG Experiences, and produced by Round Room Live, the exhibition spans over 22,000 square feet across seven purpose-built immersive rooms, showcasing the evolution, innovation and emotion that have defined Formula 1 for more than seven decades.

The experience features five iconic F1 cars including Drivers' and Constructors' Championship winners, 60+ helmets, 25+ race suits, 100 exclusive interviews, and 10 racing simulators – giving fans a unique opportunity to step inside the world of Formula 1.

Exclusive to Melbourne, the exhibition also showcases Aussie Drive – a dedicated space celebrating Australia's rich legacy in Formula 1. From Jack Brabham's pioneering success in the 1950s and Alan Jones' dominance in the 1980 season to the rise of Australia's new championship contender, Oscar Piastri, the exhibition traces the nation's remarkable journey through F1 history.

Visitors are invited to explore the stories of local heroes, iconic circuits, and unforgettable moments that have defined Australia's place in the sport. With 39 races held across two circuits, the Australian Grand Prix has remained a beloved and near-permanent highlight of the Formula 1 calendar since 1985.

Highlights include five legendary cars on display in Melbourne:

Visitors will start their journey with Once Upon A Time In Formula 1, a gallery experience that brings the sport's defining moments to life through rare photography, video, and personal stories. From there, fans move into the Design Lab, which provides a behind-the-scenes look at how F1 teams create, test and refine the world's fastest race machines.

Drivers and Duels tells the stories of legendary drivers and rivalries that have shaped F1, with highlights including the Hall of Fame, which features over 60 helmets and the most iconic race suits from Formula 1's 75-year history.

Revolution By Design explores the sport's groundbreaking innovations and the future of F1, with contributions from Lotus, McLaren, Ferrari, Mercedes, Honda, and F1 ACADEMY's Managing Director Susie Wolff, plus more.

Visitors then enter Survival, where previously unseen remains of parts of Romain Grosjean's burnt out Haas car – including the steering wheel and a tyre – and his boots and gloves from his dramatic 2020 crash in Bahrain will be displayed.

The exhibition then concludes with The Pit Wall – a cinematic and immersive experience that allows fans to relive the greatest moments in Formula 1 history.

The exhibition also supports Race Against Dementia as the official charity partner, which was founded by Sir Jackie Stewart in 2016. Teamwork, ingenuity, and an unrelenting drive for excellence – the same qualities that propelled Stewart to three World Championships – now fuel his mission off the track.

Race Against Dementia accelerates the search for preventions, diagnoses and cures for dementia. As official charity partner to the exhibition, donations will help fund Race Against Dementia researchers and scientists worldwide, equipping them with Formula 1-inspired mindset training, mentoring and collaboration tools to fast-track discoveries in dementia research.

Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer of Formula 1, said: “Melbourne is the perfect venue to host the first-ever F1 Exhibition show in the Asia-Pacific.

"Every year we see Australia's huge passion for speed and Formula 1, and this show is a true celebration of the country's outstanding contribution to motor racing. I can't wait for fans to visit the show and be immersed in the world of F1.”

'I certainly would've liked to have a 30-point gap instead of 24' - Norris on title challenge

'We'll go all in' - Verstappen aiming to make title fight 'exciting until the end' 

Lando Norris saw his championship lead cut to 24 points due to McLaren's double disqualification in Las Vegas.

Lando Norris has admitted that despite the frustrating double disqualification for McLaren in Las Vegas, nothing has changed within himself or the team as he continues to target his maiden Drivers' Championship crown.

The Standings leader and his team mate Oscar Piastri originally finished the Las Vegas Grand Prix in second and fourth respectively, but they were later disqualified from the final result due to excessive skid wear on both cars.

Norris' points advantage over the Australian and Red Bull's Max Verstappen was subsequently cut down to 24, but he can nevertheless secure the title if he outscores his rivals by two points over the Qatar Grand Prix weekend.

Asked whether he was angered by the disqualification in Las Vegas, Norris replied: “No. It doesn't help. I think from what I had to do in the race, there was already some expectation that it might happen so it wasn't a shock or a surprise.

“We knew we were having a lot more issues than we ever expected during the race. Maybe it would have hurt more if we won the race, but we didn't so it doesn't change anything. There's no point being too sad about it.

“Of course, everyone in the team was a bit gutted about the result because there's a lot of effort that goes into it. It was frustrating, but actually I was quite okay. I'm just excited to go again this weekend. It doesn't change anything – I want to try and win here in Qatar and I want to try and win in Abu Dhabi. It sucks, but that's life sometimes.”

Following the disqualification, both drivers mentioned that the ride height will be adjusted to guard against any further wear to the plank, with Norris adding that the change will most likely improve their speed in Qatar.

He said: “We'll probably be quicker now we have to put it up because I won't have to back off everywhere. Everyone thinks it'll make us slow but it'll probably make us quicker. I'm excited for all of it.

“I've never been in this situation before but I'm excited. I think it's exciting for everyone. I certainly would have liked to have the 30-point gap instead of 24 to whoever it is, but it makes it more exciting for you guys I guess, so good for you.

“I think I'll just go and try to do the same thing – I'll focus on trying to get a good Qualifying and have a good race and just take it one step at a time. I don't mind but of course the earlier I can do it, the better.

"At the same time, that doesn't change how I do anything. I just need to try and win and it's as simple as that.”

The 26-year-old is within touching distance of his first drivers' title, but he is insistent that his focus is more on extracting the best performance he can across the final two races, even with Piastri and Verstappen close behind.

Although the Red Bull driver was over 100 points adrift of the lead at one point, a run of magnificent form has allowed him to rapidly close the gap, leaving Norris more than aware that anything can still happen.

“Max won last year and I think he won the year before,” the Briton said of previous races in Qatar. “We come in with the same expectations of thinking it's going to be close. Red Bull over the last six, seven races have been, in general, the best.

“We expect a good battle and we expect it to be tough. I don't think we come into it expecting anything to be easy. We work hard, we focus on ourselves and the goal is to qualify on pole and win both races.

“We didn't do a good enough job [in Las Vegas] so it's quite simple. We accept the mistake but nothing changes. For now, I'm fine and relaxed. I just want to go and drive – especially after last weekend there's even more desire to just get on track and try and make up for last weekend. I feel ready to try and continue the good run that we've had.”

The best Taylor Sheridan shows have accumulated their loyal, and large, followings for fairly obvious reasons: They're just damn good. The 55-year-old actor turned writer-producer knows how to write compelling characters and play them off each other in distinctive settings. And he has a knack for channeling and showing off star power, whether it's Sylvester Stallone in “Tulsa King,” Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren in “1923,” or Billy Bob Thornton in “Landman.”

But stretching his empire into eight series has resulted in a feeling that Sheridan has spread himself a little too thin as a writer, and more recent seasons of his shows have shown the signs of a creator pulled in a few too many directions. Notorious for flying solo and exerting tremendous control over his projects, Sheridan's said he's usually on set during the week and then writes an entire episode of one of his shows on Saturdays — all fueled by regular B-12 shots, of course.

Sheridan might do well to value quality over quantity a bit more, and perhaps, with the shrinkage of the streaming ecosystem and his departure from Paramount for NBCUniversal, he'll have an opportunity to reset. Ranking Taylor Sheridan's shows is not massively difficult because there are some that clearly stand out and others that sink to the bottom. Though exactly which is which is up for some debate, so that's exactly what we've done. 

IndieWire Digital Director Christian Blauvelt is an admirer of Sheridan and appreciative of his work. He thinks it's impressive what an actor who had a bit part in “Star Trek: Enterprise” and played a villain on “Veronica Mars” has achieved as a creator, while mostly maintaining a respectable level of quality. Head TV Critic Ben Travers is more of a skeptic — he certainly doesn't agree that Sheridan's success stems from great writing (great casting seems more likely, plus a convenient dearth of prestige-flavored westerns) — and he's only found one or two of Sheridan's shows worthy of weekly viewing.

Who's right? Who's wrong? And what shows are worth your time? We'll let you decide.

IndieWire's list of Taylor Sheridan's shows, ranked from best to worst, is below.

Ben Travers: Not to overextend whatever credit I have as our resident “hater,” but “Tulsa King” is my preferred Taylor Sheridan show because it's the least like all of Taylor Sheridan's other shows. The first season is funny! The episodes hum! The main characters actually like each other! “Tulsa King” is about a rag-tag group of outcasts who try to build something together, rather than a haunted family who fights all the time as their long-sullied legacy falls apart. Which one of those options sounds better to you?

For Sheridan, it's not “Tulsa King.” Despite sky-high viewership, the creator (whose work on the series ended when he co-wrote the pilot) wasn't pleased with the first season and tried to oust the showrunner, Terence Winter (“Boardwalk Empire”). Thankfully, Winter made his way back to the fray (off and on), and “Tulsa King” was able to preserve parts of its original tone, while still getting Sylvester Stallone's hands dirty enough to fit in with Sheridan's other tough guys. 

Is it perfect? No. It's far from the best of either writer (Winter or Stallone), and there's certainly a more serious crime drama stirring somewhere within this silly one. But when so many of Sheridan's shows feel like medieval torture chambers (misery, violence, more misery), I'm going to savor whatever time I can get with a kingly court jester.

Christian Blauvelt: The turn away from miserabilism that “Tulsa King” represents for Sheridan is a welcome one, though I can't help think that this “crime comedy” series gets a little too silly for its own good on many occasions. And I wonder how much it would hold together at all if not for the star power of Stallone at its center. I also think that the show gets better once Sheridan left: I found the early part of Season 1 to be kind of a tract-in-show-form where Sheridan could spew his anti-woke sentiments without necessarily giving them much dramatic structure. It was annoying. I found those early eps to be as performatively about the “culture wars” as anything Sheridan has ever done, and given an added degree of inauthenticity because it feels at times that he's really a lefty just dressed in MAGA clothing.

Similarly, I found that some of the culture warrior things he said on “The Joe Rogan Experience” ended up verbatim in “Lioness” Season 2. More on that in the “Lioness” blurb, but yes, this is where I can acknowledge that I was so high on the Sheridan-verse I literally listened to his entire three-hour-plus Joe Rogan podcast, which was another reminder about what a terrible interviewer Rogan is and a massive missed opportunity given how few interviews Sheridan grants. Anyway, once “Tulsa King” actually became a show about its characters rather than making a point to ruffle PC sensibilities it became the fun romp you describe. Is it churlish to say that Sheridan's best show is one he barely had involvement with after its beginning? Of course. But though we are not here to bury Sheridan, we can certainly be clear-eyed about the limitations of his work as well.

Christian: I mean, if any series brings tears to my eyes for the entire final episode that has to be a massive success, and for me “1883” is in every sense Sheridan's most perfectly formed show. This is the rare 10-episode series that actually does feel like a 10-hour movie, one devoid of flab and filler but that also never puts plot before character even as it's exquisitely plotted.

A wagon-train Western for the ages, “1883” gives us our chronological first glimpse of the Dutton family as an impoverished first-generation Irish clan in Tennessee heading to parts West for a better life. Yes, it focuses on the trip's grind and misery, but not for the sake of miserabilism; more to establish real stakes, meaning, and purpose. It takes five episodes just for the wagon train to get out of Texas, and though that may be partly due to Sheridan being able to film that much more on his Texas ranch, it emphasizes what those seeking a better life in the West were willing to endure – largely on foot. And like any immigrant story, there's something incredibly hopeful at its core — a hope that justifies the grind.

This is also one of the only Westerns other than “Heaven's Gate” to delve deep into the extraordinary diversity of those heading West — that they were very often immigrants from Germany, Sweden, Poland, the Balkans, and all over Eastern Europe, including persecuted Roma. Like “Heaven's Gate,” there isn't much English dialogue you hear from these characters and “1883” focuses on the misunderstandings that arise simply from the language barrier.

Sheridan's writing of women can also be very bad across his work… and yet, he delivered the single most complex characterization of his entire writing career in Elsa (Isabel May), whose poetic narration anchors the series. There's also a reason why Sam Elliott got the most prominent acting award ever for a Sheridan show for his work on “1883” — a SAG Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries. As a classic Western gunslinger who suffers the loss of his entire family from smallpox before deciding to embark on one last journey to the Pacific as a wagon train boss, he ends up tugging at your heartstrings like no one else.

Ben: Well, what you find poetic I find grating. Elsa's narration is a crutch, and her observations are too often vague platitudes that betray the insight she should have as a storyteller who knows the whole narrative.

To that end, “1883” may acknowledge the American melting pot as it spills out across the plains, but its perspective remains rooted in a white family, which makes it familiar and limited. Women characters rank second only to Native Americans when it comes to Sheridan's vexing portrayals, and “1883” doesn't exactly work to acknowledge the ways in which the country's original settlers built a functioning society. That may not be fair to the story it does tell — with passion, earnestness, and ambition — but it's a historical fact that seems to butt against the writer's preferred American origin story. (And it makes his sadistic streak harder to stomach when the pioneers start dying off in disparate droves.)

Elsewhere, James and Margaret Dutton (Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, respectively) don't do much for me as protagonists (or performers), which elevates Elliott's work almost by default. (I say almost because he is quite affecting, even if that SAG Award Actors Award should've gone to Steve Carell for “The Patient.”) Perhaps if “1883” weren't tied to “Yellowstone” — if it had been a true standalone project — some of these slights may have softened. But as it is, I still feel them.

Christian: What's so invigorating about “1923” Season 1 is how much Sheridan works in pure adventure mode. It's not miserabilism for miserabilism's sake, even in the repeated, brutal beatings suffered by Aminah Nieves' Teonna, an Indigenous girl forced to live in an abusive Catholic boarding school. That misery has a point: to illuminate a particular injustice rarely shown before on American screens. And of course, it's all to set up a thrilling, cross-country revenge story for Teonna, which becomes the best part of Season 2 — maybe the only genuinely satisfying part of Season 2, when all is said and done.

Yes, this show fizzles a bit by the end of its 16-episode run, and it's hard not to think that it would have been better served with less. But there's no storyline more purely fun and exciting in Sheridan's canon than that of big game hunter Spencer Dutton (Brandon Sklenar, in a breakout performance for the ages) finding romance with runaway British royal Alexandra (Julia Schlaepfer) on the East African savannah. Together, they're menaced by lions, sharks, and a consumptive tugboat captain trying to ferry them to Suez when Spencer gets the call to return to Montana lest his family empire be overrun by a mustache-twirling Timothy Dalton.

Here, Sheridan thinks in terms of images for his storytelling in a way he doesn't always: When Spencer and Alexandra are adrift on the high seas following the aforementioned tugboat captain's death, they run afoul of an abandoned ocean liner “ghost ship” that causes them to wreck as well. A couple episodes later, after they're rescued, Alex runs afoul of the aristocrats who tried to force her into a loveless marriage and a shipboard duel with Spencer wearing a tux ensues. All of this is the kind of spectacle that even most big-screen entertainments haven't offered in years, and it's Sheridan making the absolute most of Paramount's budget-largesse at the time. The money is on the screen.

Unfortunately, Season 2, with the exception of Teonna's revenge arc, does see Sheridan slipping back into his miserabilist tendencies. There's a godawful storyline where Dalton's land baron endlessly engages in sadomasochistic sex with two sex workers he's hired and is trying to turn against each other: Yes, it's trying to make a point about the entanglement of economic power and sexual abuse, but the point is established early and its continued elaboration calls into question Sheridan's own motives. There are still some great moments here and there — Spencer running afoul of evil hobos when hitching a ride on a boxcar and him freeing a tarred-and-feathered sex worker from a puritanical mob in Fort Worth come to mind — but the series ends on a note of such anguish that I can't ever imagine watching “1923” again. “1883” ends tragically but feels earned (rather than just it being “Oh, let's put our audience through as much agony as possible”). This show, however, hooks you with adventure and romance and a gripping revenge plot only to leave you totally shattered.

Ben: You've done most of my hater work for me, Christian, so I'll just say Harrison Ford does a lot to make this grim western tolerable. In a rare cowboy role for the movie star, Ford's Jacob Dutton sports a perpetual grimace that's softened by our decades of affection for the actor himself. I don't know if I'd go as far as to say Sheridan relies on that endearing quality — he's going to tell his story, his way, no matter who's in the saddle — but it's certainly helpful to his audience. There's just something about that face, no matter what horrors it witnesses or perpetuates, that triggers your humanity.

Ben: “Yellowstone” aside (kind of), Taylor Sheridan doesn't exactly have an established track record when it comes to creating sustainable TV series. That makes sense, to a degree, given he started in movies (and still often writes like he's making movies). But between “1883” (limited series), “Bass Reeves” (canceled after one season), and the relative infancy of his other “hit” shows, it's worth wondering whether any of his TV ideas are built to last. (Even “Tulsa King,” which is about to shoot its fourth season, has faced production issues every year! Season 4 doesn't even have a showrunner!)

So the nicest thing I can say about “Mayor of Kingstown” is that it's proven it can go the distance. Relying on its star “Avenger” (if not a star “Avenger”) and a premiere episode twist straight out of “Game of Thrones,” the dark-and-gritty Michigan crime drama has produced four seasons in five years, all of which star Jeremy Renner's ex-con turned unofficial warden of a prison (Kings)town, Mike McLusky. Along the way, it's employed legends like Dianne Wiest and Edie Falco to bring emotional nuance to a series mired in merciless pain. It's antihero show in an age that's moved on from antiheroes, but hey, at least it's a legitimate show!

Christian: It is an antihero show in an age of that's moved on from antiheroes — though I would argue that the Duttons in “Yellowstone” have basically become a crime family by that point, unlike their noble presentation in “1883” and “1923” — but the reason for that may also be that “Mayor of Kingstown” was the first series Sheridan wrote even though it wasn't the first to air. So it strangely has a whiff of the mid-2010s in many respects.

I think this is peak middle-of-the-road Sheridan. Not particularly memorable, but, as you've said, oddly sustainable? This is probably the closest he comes to the CBS or TNT model of shows that people watch for years on end but that don't in any way move the culture.

Ben: Ah, “Yellowstone.” The unexpected hit that became the backbone of an entire network (and then its streamer, and then, come 2029, another streamer). The Kevin Costner-starring Western certainly benefited from his star power, helping to lure an audience eager for the sweeping American grandeur captured in “Dances with Wolves” and the next iteration of iconic cowboys glimpsed in “Silverado,” “Wyatt Earp,” and “Open Range.”

While Sheridan's breakthrough series certainly delivered on those fronts — John Dutton's existential battle against progress, time, and death itself proved to be the series' most arresting conflict, which was only emphasized by Sheridan's many, many, many montages of cowboys riding across the ranch's purple mountain majesty — the behind-the-scenes battles between “Yellowstone's” principal patriarchs ruined a delayed, extended, and ultimately nonsensical final season.

And when I say “ruined,” I mean the best of “Yellowstone” fell to Earth alongside its omnipresent worst traits: uneven pacing, clichéd, redundant character development, and a brutal streak that made scenes too silly to take seriously and too nasty to savor. Even for those who thought parts of “Yellowstone” were worthy of the awards love that never came, the ending emphasized exactly why Sheridan's first TV series deserved exactly what it got: big ratings, little relevance.

Christian: I do agree that the way “Yellowstone” ended was so disastrous it mars the entire show — to me it's far worse than what happened with the “Lost” or “Game of Thrones” finales, and there's part of me that thinks “Yellowstone” should be ranked last here as a result. Especially since “1883” and “1923” do so many more interesting things with this kind of material. “Yellowstone” is, above all, a ridiculous soap opera.

That said, there are times throughout its run that you can see very clearly why it became such a phenomenon, and I think part of it is due to its pacing: This could be as languid a series as any on TV, one largely about character rather than plot (which is why the plot-heavy contortions of its final season are such a betrayal). This is a show where you suddenly could have Gil Birmingham giving a long monologue about the relationship between men and wolves, and how each exist to keep the population of the other in check — several minutes in, I let out an audible “This is great.” 

Same goes for the frequent musical performances (only Cheo Hodari Coker's “Luke Cage” in recent vintage embraced putting plot on the skids like this) and “hangout moments” with the cowboys in the bunk house. “Yellowstone” worked best when it was a mood, a vibe. Having Sheridan himself appear as a sex-god horse trader who counts Bella Hadid as his girlfriend actually contributed to that vibe. Having the endless mean-spiritedness of Jamie (Wes Bentley) and Beth (Kelly Reilly) curdle into conspiracy nonsense and an ultimate knife fight very much did not.

Christian: I personally would rank “Lawmen: Bass Reeves” much higher on this list and I protest Ben's placement of it here! This is one of the most perceptive depictions in American media of that precise moment that Reconstruction transitioned into Jim Crow. And it did so via the first actual historical retelling of a real-life lawman in the Sheridan canon (though the series was created and showrun by Chad Sheehan).

Bass Reeves was a real-life Black lawman who patrolled the Arkansas-Oklahoma border in the 1870s, and the exceptionally gifted David Oyelowo disappeared into this role as effectively as any actor in Sheridan's TV shows. The eight-part series tells an effective story about Reeves going from enslavement to the life of wearing a badge and building a family. It's overarching plot then concerns strange rumors of a “Mr. Sundown” who is spiriting away Black men accused of (often spurious) crimes, and Reeves' investigation has compelling implications for whether slavery ever fully went away or just became the culture of incarceration that's defined American judicial life ever since.

The series is given some of the richest period specificity of any of Sheridan's shows via the extraordinary production design of “Do the Right Thing” and “Malcolm X” legend Wynn Thomas (who just received a richly deserved Honorary Oscar). Did “Bass Reeves” need Dennis Quaid as a wily foil for Reeves? Possibly not. But this is one of the more coherent and fully realized series on this list.

Ben: I gotta say, you're making it sound a whole lot better than it looks. The premiere is a regurgitation of Bass Reeves' Wikipedia page, the legendary lawman's characterization is as broad and accessible as any stock cop on CBS, and the whole show only came to be because Sheridan thought he could fit Reeves into the “Yellowstone” universe, couldn't quite make it work, and then stuck his name on a seasonal anthology that only lasted one season. (They should really change the title from “Lawmen” to “Lawman,” but I guess they're holding out hope for a follow-up.)

Like much of Sheridan's work, it may have good ideas and great production values, but it struggles with the core of great television: characters. I love Oyelowo, and he does his darnedest to liven up a rudimentary historic retelling, but his good-hearted lawman is too disengaged from the world around him. Everyone is too eager to agree with each other and get on with it, whether it's a man of faith conversing with an atheist or an old-school judge and a new-era officer. The series isn't interested in the nuanced internal conflicts that must have roiled inside a former slave who chose to protect and serve slave owners, a Black man forced to fight for the Confederate army, or even a pacifist who picked up a gun every single day. It's interested in tropes. And Bass deserves better.

Christian: One of Sheridan's greatest skills is spotting rising talent to champion: Isabel May in “1883,” Brandon Sklenar in “1923,” and I'd argue Laysla de Oliveira in “Lioness.” The spectrum of material she's asked to play in Season 1 is extraordinary: Stuck in an abusive relationship and working as a fast-food fryer, de Oliveira's Cruz finds a way out when, during a fight with her hateful significant other, she literally stumbles into a Marine recruiting office. And she enlists. It puts her on a journey to becoming a covert operative in the CIA's Lioness division, where certain women agents go undercover in terrorist organizations, drug cartels, and more.

Of Mexican and Syrian heritage, Cruz, who can speak Arabic, is perfect to go undercover inside an Al-Qaeda-style terrorist organization. She's to befriend the daughter of its leader, who, along with her father, leads a luxe life of designer apparel and luxury goods. So Cruz, coming from grinding poverty, has to act accustomed to that life in addition to achieving her mission objectives. I'm not sure there's an actor in any of these shows who's been asked to do more than de Oliveira.

It all boils down to a remarkably critical take on U.S. adventurism abroad, down to the inspired choice of casting “Egyptian Jon Stewart” Bassem Youssef as the amiable terrorist leader. Nicole Kidman as a CIA operative with a disturbingly husky “American” accent does not lend sympathy to the U.S. cause, nor does Zoe Saldana as an operative almost pathologically capable of severing the brutality of her job from her cozy private life. Season 2 then goes in a similar direction, casting a critical eye on the U.S. drug war. It's all full of Sheridan indulgences, including him playing a devil-may-care Special Forces operative who can't keep his shirt on and spouts lines he spoke verbatim about “not being able to have a conversation” about trans issues on “The Joe Rogan Experience.” But working in an “action mode” suits Sheridan, especially as he doesn't indulge in jingoism.

Ben: I'm not sure if I'm fully sold on “Lioness” as a critical take on America's international policy — for all the moral hesitancy over what their missions ultimately accomplish, there's still too much “rah rah” support for the military industrial complex to be seen as a full-on condemnation — but I have to say, as a pure narrative, I find it tremendously dull. The suspense is cheap, the characterizations are clichéd, and the action is hampered because — like way too many Sheridan shows — it's all so freaking dark! 

In the Season 1 finale, it takes more than 40 minutes to pull the pin on the grenade (so to speak), and once they do, the explosion can't even be seen through the black of night. That, and Nicole Kidman gets stuck with one of the worst line readings of her career, while Zoe Saldana barely survives her heated confrontation with the titular lioness. There's something to be said for men sitting and shouting at each other in rooms, stirring up trouble until it nearly starts a war, while the women do the real work outside in the field… but “Lioness” doesn't fit that feminist interpretation, as much as it wants you to believe it can. 

Ben: Before you even get into the ugliness within “Landman's” story, you have to first consider how fundamentally irresponsible it is, even as a piece of fiction. Here's a show so in love with the sound of its own ultra-conservative voice, not only is it happy to prop up the oil industry by spouting lies about clean energy, it's also happy to cash the checks Big Oil throws its way to keep spreading misinformation about why oilfields are the future and wind turbines are for weaklings.

Which brings us to the nauseating nature of the narrative itself. A bitter, hardened story about a bitter, hardened oil lobbyist, the series is built on provocation. Tommy Norris (Billy Bob Thornton) loves to mock anyone and everyone he meets for knowing less than he does. That includes the many… uninformed women populating “Landman” (be it his impetuous ex-wife, his sexed-up daughter, or his “big city” attorney), as well as Tommy's white collar boss and any other authority figure who makes the mistake of knocking on his door. No one measures up to Tommy's standards, and he may like it that way, but it makes for an exhausting viewing experience — who wants to let some old, stuck-up asshole bullshit for hours on end, when he's so sure he knows better than everyone but remains completely oblivious that he's blabbing out of his ass?

It's a testament to Thornton's tough-talking charms that “Landman” is still watchable, just as it's a black mark against Taylor Sheridan that he can't see the tragedy inherent to Tommy's story — a man trapped in the American dream as it rots beneath his feet. Instead, his creator only sees a hero, when by any objective measure, there only stands a fool.

Christian: Sheridan has written some incredible women in these shows: Helen Mirren's Cara in “1923,” Laysla de Oliveira's Cruz in “Lioness,” Aminah Nieves' Teonna in “1923,” and Isabel May's Elsa in “1883” (the single most compelling character he's written, full-stop). Then there's “Landman.” Stephen Rodrick summed it up best in Rolling Stone when he asked of “Landman,” “Why does Jerry Jones have better lines than Demi Moore?” And that's even before considering the unfortunate writing for Ali Larter and Michelle Randolph's characters.

Frankly, much of what I dislike about “Landman” is what similarly rubbed me the wrong way about those early eps of “Tulsa King”: You're right, Ben, that this series is “built on provocation.” It's almost like if Billy Bob Thornton's evil assassin character in the first season of “Fargo” was suddenly given a heroic reframing — Sheridan is all-in on valorizing the petro economy. It speaks to how muddled, perhaps deliberately, his politics are that he can have the entire Dutton franchise be about preserving and respecting the land (and demonizing miners at multiple turns) and then make a show with basically the theme “fuck the environment.” It's also just incredibly wasteful when it comes to its cast: That's what you do with Jon Hamm? Slap a carbon tax on this one.

Benedict Cumberbatch has confirmed that he remains committed to adapting Rogue Male, the classic British novel that he says inspired Ian Fleming to write James Bond.


	Cumberbatch and his production company SunnyMarch announced in 2016 that they planned to adapt Geoffrey Household's book, but the feature film has yet to get off the ground. 


	Speaking on the SmartLess podcast, hosted by Sean Hayes, Jason Bateman, and Will Arnett, Cumberbatch said he hoped to slate the shoot for 2026.


	He warned, however, that “there are other huge commitments involving cloaks floating about,” which appeared to be confirmation that he is reprising his role as Doctor Strange in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

	“We haven't got a filming date yet, but it's something we're trying to slate for next year,” Cumberbatch said. “We will make it, definitely.”

	Published in 1939, Rogue Male follows an unnamed English sportsman who attempts to assassinate a European dictator, strongly implied to be Adolf Hitler. He is caught, tortured and left for dead, but escapes back to England, where he hides out in the countryside with enemy agents and police in pursuit.


	“It's the original fugitive novel and a huge inspiration for Ian Fleming for Bond,” Cumberbatch continued. “When we first sat down to talk about this, [we thought] is this a bit of a guy's film? 


	“The longer we were exploring the themes of it and the motivation behind the guy's actions, and the outcome, and how he's turned on by his own side, as well as the side he's tried to take down, it's fascinating how it plays into the political spectrum of what's going on in the world right now.”

	











	When the project was first announced, Michael Lesslie (Macbeth, Assassin's Creed) was hired to write the screenplay. It was set up at Fox Searchlight, and Cumberbatch was slated to star.


	Peter O'Toole appeared in a BBC adaptation of Rogue Male made for television in 1977. Twentieth Century Fox adapted the novel in 1940 as Man Hunt.

Recently, I was compelled to do a hard thing: I turned down a grant. The decision was painful because, right now, the organization I lead — Black Public Media — really needs funding. Congress' rescission of $1.1 billion in public media support stripped $1.8 million of committed funding from our budget. Like many others in the public media sector, and the greater arts community, my team and I are now scrambling to accelerate our fundraising efforts. To stay afloat, we've had to do other hard things: trim staff, decrease grant-making, and cut programs. Fortunately, BPM also has private sector support, so we're not closing our doors. Some of our donors are stepping up in remarkable ways, but in today's anti-DEI climate, others are choosing to lie low. As grateful as we are for the help we received, it is unclear whether private philanthropy alone can fill the $1.8 million gap.  For nearly 50 years, BPM has helped independent media makers bring stories about the global Black experience to the public. We've long served as a vital funding source for content creators whose projects make other funders uneasy. “Hip Hop: Beyond Beats & Rhymes,” “I Am Not Your Negro,” “Red Summers VR,” and “Mama Gloria” are among the hundreds of projects we've supported. Projects we fund sometimes provide source material for narrative films, video games and XR experiences, reaching even broader audiences. BPM's collaborations with PBS bring groundbreaking broadcasts, streaming projects, and community engagement initiatives to the public free of charge. These projects often do the difficult but necessary job of challenging norms and sparking lively, essential conversations. Pursuing BPM's mission has never been easy, but lately it has become especially fraught. The $35K NEA grant we walked away from was modest, but it would have supported our community screenings program. I made the difficult decision to decline the funding to safeguard BPM's independence. If we accepted the grant, I worried we'd end up clashing with the federal agency over films that don't conform with the current administration's priorities. Earlier this year, we were advised to avoid using words included on the government's growing list of disfavored words. The so-called “woke” terms include: diversity, inclusion, climate crisis, equity, systemic, racism, LGBTQ, social justice, minority-serving institution, pronouns, and Black, the first word in our name! The makers we serve frequently pursue stories addressing the themes on this list. Avoiding those words to placate a funder would compromise our very mission — one hard thing we just won't do. Independent media makers are experiencing hardships, too. The fact that so many are small business owners and job creators in communities across the United States — and that public funding is a force multiplier in stimulating local economies — is too often missed in this discussion.

Earlier this year, the National Science Foundation abruptly terminated parts of a $3.2 million grant it had awarded to a Scientists in the Family project, which includes a documentary titled, “My Mom the Scientist.” The award-winning filmmaker, Thomas Allen Harris, has over 30 years of experience in the industry. The film is about his mother's perseverance in a field that didn't openly welcome people who looked like her. This financial setback affects not only Harris, but ripples through to hurt all the subcontractors he would have supported and the engagement activities that would have highlighted other Black scientists in local communities. Globally, the $13.64 billion documentary film and television industry creates jobs and benefits a wide range of small businesses. Firms that provide equipment, editing services, graphic design, AV, lighting, catering, costuming, transportation, marketing, publicity — the list goes on. Our sister organizations that support stories from the Asian American, Latinx, Native American, Pacific Islander, and other underrepresented communities face similar challenges. The artists we all work with create content reflecting the rich diversity of this nation. We're certainly not the only members of the creative economy going through hard times. But as public media producers and distributors, our artists' work is accessible in all corners of the nation, at no expense to viewers. It contributes to the cultural enrichment and connectedness of all Americans on a scale unparalleled by most other art forms. That's something to be cherished, not dismissed. The United States is at its best and most prosperous when creative freedom rings, knowledge is shared and intolerance finds no shelter. Preserving these ideals requires more of us to be willing to do the hard things. Leslie Fields-Cruz is the executive director of Black Public Media, the nation's only nonprofit solely dedicated to the development of nonfiction Black content for distribution on public media. Fields-Cruz joined BPM in 2001 to manage its program development fund. She served as director of programs from 2005-2008 and as VP of programs and operations from 2008-2014 before being named BPM's third executive director in 2014.

Days before real-life Hallmark couple Erin Krakow and Ben Rosenbaum revealed they're expecting their first baby — thrilling “When Calls The Heart” fans with the news on November 26, 2025 — Rosenbaum gave EntertainmentNow a little glimpse into their private life. 

His comments, it turns out, included a sweet hint that he and Krakow, who've been married since June, have been focused on their newest roles as parents-to-be since wrapping filming on season 13. 

Rosenbaum, who stars in Hallmark Channel's Thanksgiving weekend premiere of “The Christmas Cup,” had to reschedule his initial interview with EntertainmentNow about the upcoming movie because he was stuck at an appointment. 

No big deal, of course — but now it's clear the dad-to-be has likely been to quite a few appointments lately, evidenced in part by the adorable pics Krakow posted of them with their dog, Willoughby, while holding up sonogram images to reveal their baby news. 

Rosenbaum also mentioned that they'd been catching up on doctor's appointments when he did sit down with EntertainmentNow, noting that since “When Calls the Heart” recently wrapped filming in Vancouver, he and Krakow have been settling back into “boring life stuff” at home in Los Angeles. 

“We do try to maintain some privacy away from set,” Rosenbaum said. “But in general, I can say we go from filming ‘When Calls the Heart,' where we're very focused; our attention is on work when we're up there, we know what our job is to do, and it demands a lot of time, especially for Erin. So our hiatus time is really the time that we get to, like, relax.” 

“And also, unfortunately, it gets pretty busy pretty quick,” he continued. “But with all good things, you know — travel, visit and see family, and then just the boring life stuff of, like, all the things that we've neglected while we've been up in Canada. We have to come back to L.A. and kind of pay attention to things around the house and doctor's appointments, and all that kind of stuff. It's just kind of back to normal life, plus the fun of travel.” 

Krakow, who plays WCTH lead Elizabeth Thornton, and Rosenbaum, who plays Mike Hickam on the show, have both been on the series since its start in 2014. But the couple met in 2009 when they were both cast in “The Importance of Being Earnest” at the renowned Guthrie Theater in Rosenbaum's hometown of Minneapolis, he told EntertainmentNow. 

“Honestly, when Erin and I first met, I actually saw her working the first time we met, and really just developed a crush on her talent,” Rosenbaum said. “She's just so good on stage and on screen.”

The two were able to spend time together in her native New York when a touring stage production he was in opened and closed there, he said, noting that gave them “more opportunities to connect, and a romance developed from there.” 

Rosenbaum and Krakow kept their romance quiet for years, but they began hinting at their relationship in social media photos several years ago, including taking trips with fellow “When Calls The Heart” couple Kevin McGarry and Kayla Wallace (who are also expecting their first baby) and adopting their dog Willoughby. 

They surprised fans by posting wedding photos on June 23 and have shocked Hearties once again with their baby news five months later. As Rosenbaum prepares for the premiere of his first starring role in a Hallmark movie — another big achievement in 2025 — he told EntertainmentNow that his wife is his “biggest cheerleader.” 

Season 13 of “When Calls The Heart” is set to premiere on January 4, while “The Christmas Cup” starring Rosenbaum, Rhiannon Fish, and several WCTH castmates premieres on November 30 at 6 p.m. Eastern time.

	Among the many members of this Trump Administration to be spoofed on this season of South Park — easily one of the wildest yet — Secretary of War Pete Hegseth has so far been spared. That is, until last night. During a Thanksgiving-themed episode titled “Turkey Trot,” Hegseth, a former Fox News anchor and military general, was depicted as an Instagram Reels-obsessed content creator sent to town on Trump's orders to free Peter Thiel, who you might recall was arrested in the previous episode. “Don't just make a bunch of content. Like, actually go and do something,” South Park's Trump tells Hegseth. 


	Elsewhere, the town is planning to host a 5k Turkey Trot that is, naturally, sponsored by Saudi Arabia. The only caveat? Contestants can't speak ill of the royal family. Cartman recruits Token to his team in hopes of winning the $5,000 prize. In a send-up of the increasingly prevalent ideas of race science permeating through conservative circles, Cartman describes himself as a “racing scientist,” noting that Token's race always wins races.

	The stage is thus set for an Eddington-style standoff, as Hegseth arrives in South Park and immediately mistakes the race for an Antifa uprising. The quick-thinking Secretary of War immediately starts live-streaming the event before being accosted by Director of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who ends up shooting a dog in a scenario seemingly plucked from Noem's memoir, which caused a stir during the 2024 election. The episode ends with Hegseth botching the Peter Thiel extraction and ending up in jail himself right alongside Thiel.

	This latest season of South Park has consistently raised eyebrows as it takes on the current administration's key figures head-on. All the while, they've battled their network, Paramount+, which recently completed a merger with David Ellison's Skydance in a deal that many believe came with political assurances to the current administration. For more than twenty years, South Park has made skewering pop culture its defining ethos. Co-creator Trey Parker recently told the New York Times that “It's not that we got all political, it's that politics became pop culture.”

It turned out to be a historic night for the Irwins! Fan-favorite Robert Irwin has officially won “Dancing with the Stars.” 

His sister Bindi Irwin marked the milestone with a loving message and a celebratory photo. “TWO MIRRORBALLS NOW CALL AUSTRALIA ZOO HOME!!!! Congratulations and all the love in the world to @robertirwinphotography and @witneycarson. What. A. Night,” she wrote.

The win arrives ten years after Bindi earned her own historic Mirrorball trophy during season 21 with Derek Hough. 

Now, Robert has added a second shining prize to the family's legacy. 

The siblings each made “DWTS” history in their own way, drawing global love as they honored their late father, Steve Irwin, through their performances.

Robert's victory capped a heated three-round, three-hour live finale in Los Angeles on Tuesday evening. The 21-year-old overcame a painful rib injury to defeat fellow finalists Jordan Chiles, Alix Earle, Dylan Efron, and Elaine Hendrix. 

His emotional season, which began with a visit to his father's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in August, made him a fan favorite from the start.

The unexpected elimination of frontrunner Whitney Leavitt the week before pushed the momentum even further in Robert's direction. By the final night, his win felt inevitable.

Robert delivered some of his best dances of the season during the finale. His judges' choice quickstep to “Are You Gonna Be My Girl” by Jet showed clean footwork and a strong frame. His freestyle, performed to Avicii's “The Nights” and Sam Sparro's “Black & Gold,” leaned into full-throttle choreography and explosive lifts. 

He also excelled in the “instant dance challenge,” where he and partner Witney Carson received their style and song only minutes before performing.

Despite entering the show with no dance background, Robert leaned into his natural charisma and physicality. He embraced the lighthearted moments, including ripping his shirt mid-salsa, while still honoring his family values and his father's legacy.

After taking the Mirrorball trophy, Robert said he is heading into an even busier chapter of life. “I go to New York and then straight to South Africa to film another show over there,” he told E! News. “And then, I'm back home.”

Witney chimed in that she will be with him soon. “Witney's coming down to Australia,” Robert said, as the dancer joked, “You're not getting rid of me that easy.”

Robert reflected on the meaning of the season. “I've been able to write my own legacy with Witney as we tell stories of positivity, vulnerability, passion and fun.” He also shared that this journey has been years in the making. 

A recently resurfaced 2015 video showed young Robert backstage during Bindi's winning season, saying he hoped to compete on the show someday.

That dream just came true—along with a family celebration that now includes two Mirrorball trophies at Australia Zoo.

Xochitl Gomez claims she's “single” — but fueled speculation she's dating Robert Irwin with a pointed social media move.

During Tuesday night's finale of “Dancing With the Stars” Season 34, which saw Irwin win the dance competition, Gomez, who won Season 32, was asked in an interview with “DWTS” pro Jan Ravnik whether she's “single.”

Giggling, the actress insisted, “Yes, I am. I am. Yes, I am.”

However, on Wednesday, she took to Instagram to post a carousel from finale night.

“What a season! Congratulations to all the finalists ♥️🪩🫂,” Gomez, 19, captioned the photos, which included a cozy close-up shot with Irwin, 21.

Gomez concluded her slideshow with a picture of a much-younger Irwin holding the Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy his older sister, Bindi Irwin, won in 2015's “DWTS” Season 21.

“The last picture though,” he commented.

Robert, for his part, hasn't done much to dispel the romance rumors, which sparked after he and Gomez displayed undeniable chemistry while performing on “DWTS” together earlier this month. (The show's current contestants were paired with past champions for a dance relay.)

“Everyone's asking if you and Xochitl are an item!” a TMZ paparazzo said to Robert as he arrived for practice.

Swerving the question, the wildlife conservationist replied, “Oh, my gosh. We had the best time! That dance was so much fun.”

He marveled at the energetic routine, going on to gush that “she's the best.”

Asked once again whether the pair are “an item or just friends,” Robert smiled and walked into the studio.

Then ahead of Tuesday's show, Gomez was photographed paying the zookeeper a private visit outside his trailer.

The “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” star presented Robert with a massive bouquet of flowers, gave him an affectionate side hug and laughed as she chatted with him.

After the seemingly flirty exchange, a source told Page Six that the duo have been enjoying each other's company since connecting through the dance competition.

“They are having a lot of fun. They're both extroverts with a lot of energy,” the source said, calling Gomez “the sweetest person.”

Together for Palestine, the humanitarian operation that put on a massive benefit concert in September, has announced a benefit single featuring Brian Eno, Neneh Cherry, and many more. “Lullaby,” a version of the traditional Palestinian song “Yamma Mweel El Hawa,” will be released on December 12, with designs on the coveted UK Christmas No. 1 slot. Others in the ensemble include Nadine Shah, Mabel, Celeste, and Bastille's Dan Smith. Peter Gabriel wrote an English-language lyric for the cover, and the Palestinian musician Nai Barghouti arranged and recomposed the song alongside Shards' Kieran Brunt.

Eno said in a press release, “After a year defined by unimaginable loss, grief and injustice, we want to end with an act of love for Palestine's children. Lullaby reflects their beauty, their longing and their hope. If we rally together and download it, we have a real shot at landing Christmas No. 1—and turning that moment into vital life-saving support for Gaza's families.”

Barghouti adds, “This lullaby from our Palestinian musical heritage has been with me since early childhood. Today, it returns at a much-needed time as a reminder of what Palestinians will never lose: hope, defiance, beauty, and dignity.”

Kieran Brunt co-produced “Lullaby” alongside Benji B and Henri Davies. Also featured on the track are Amena, Lana Lubany, Leigh-Anne, London Community Gospel Choir, Sura Abdo, Tyson, Yasmeen Ayyashi, and Ysee. Together for Palestine's T4P label will release the song, via distributor Empire. All proceeds go to Choose Love's Together for Palestine Fund, which supports the Palestinian-led organisations Taawon, Palestine Children's Relief Fund and Palestine Medical Relief Service.

In Los Angeles, meanwhile, another benefit concert, Artists for Aid, has been detailed ahead of its January 10 staging. Organized for the second year by Mustafa, the concert will feature Geese, Blood Orange, Alex G, Clairo, Faye Webster, Noname, Ravyn Lenae, Daniel Cesar, and more, with hosts Bella Hadid and Pedro Pascal.

A new batch of artists has also signed up to geoblock their music from streaming in Israel. My Bloody Valentine, Saba, Shygirl, YHWH Nailgun, and Denzel Curry are among the additions to No Music for Genocide.

Kevin Spacey will face civil claims of sexual assault from three men at the High Court in London next October.


	A British performer named Ruari Cannon, who has waived his right to anonymity, and two other claimants who have not, have alleged Spacey abused them between 2000 and 2015.


	A judge set the provisional trial date of 12 October 2026 for the cases at a hearing earlier this week. Spacey denies all the allegations.


	Spacey was cleared of nine sexual offence charges at a criminal trial in 2023. He was also found not liable in a U.S. civil case brought by actor Anthony Rapp, who alleged Spacey molested him when he was 14.

	Spacey made headlines last week with an interview with The Telegraph newspaper during which he described his financial situation as “not great,” adding, “I'm living in hotels, I'm living in Airbnbs, I'm going where the work is. I literally have no home, that's what I'm attempting to explain.”

	In a social post a few days later, Spacey expanded on his comments from The Telegraph interview and explained that he was not homeless in the literal sense.

	The House of Cards alum, who last year appeared on Piers Morgan Uncensored to discuss his debts, including the foreclosure of his Baltimore abode, said, “The costs over these last seven years have been astronomical. I've had very little coming in and everything going out.”


	Spacey likened his predicament to the experiences of actors of yore, who were swept into the Hollywood blacklist as a result of McCarthyism. He cited Kirk Douglas' willingness to work with screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, then blacklisted, as the type of strategic allyship that could help him right the ship.

	











	“So, my feeling is if Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino call Evan [Lowenstein, Spacey's manager] tomorrow, it will be over,” he posited. “I will be incredibly honored and delighted when that level of talent picks up the phone. And I believe it's going to happen.”


	Most recently, Spacey wrapped production in the U.K. on an under-the-radar sci-fi thriller called The Tenth Planet. The project was on sale at this year's American Film Market.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce may be reconsidering a key detail in their upcoming wedding.

On Wednesday, Page Six reported that the couple is considering a change to their original wedding venue due to a potentially larger guest list than they initially planned.

Sources claimed Swift and Kelce are reviewing the list and may want to invite more people.

The outlet added that Kelce maintains strong ties with many of his childhood friends from Cleveland, Ohio, in addition to having a wide circle of teammates and NFL acquaintances.

Swift, on the other hand, has a plethora of music industry friends she is considering for her guest list.

Previously, it was reported that Swift and Kelce plan to host an intimate wedding in Rhode Island next summer. According to The US Sun, the “Cruel Summer” singer and the NFL star are prepared to drop $1.2 million into the landscaping alone in Swift's $32 million pad for the big day.

But a new report from Page Six claimed that Swift and Kelce are contemplating keeping the Rhode Island plans and might host a second wedding venue elsewhere.

Sources told the outlet that the couple is eyeing the Ocean House Hotel in Watch Hill, which is located right next to Swift's estate.

Page Six further reported that Swift and Kelce could scrap their original plan and go “all out” at a larger venue. Among the potential locations is Blackberry Farm, a 4,200-acre luxury resort in Tennessee.

The outlet added that Swift and Kelce are also exploring the idea of a destination wedding abroad, with options including private islands like Necker in the British Virgin Islands or elsewhere in the Caribbean.

Reps for Swift and Kelce have yet to confirm these reports.

Earlier this month, rumors swirled that Taylor Swift is lining up a star-studded squad of A-list bridesmaids for her wedding.

According to a report by The US Sun, the mega-pop star already asked her longtime friend, Gigi Hadid, to be part of the bridal party. The outlet claimed that the supermodel was “thrilled” and “wasn't expecting” to be asked and accepted immediately.

In addition to Hadid, Swift reportedly asked her fellow pop star Selena Gomez to be one of her bridesmaids. The outlet noted that the “Opalite” singer hopes to get advice from Gomez, who married Benny Blanco earlier this year.

The band wrote the 2016 track "Demagogue" when Trump was still a candidate for the presidential election.

Franz Ferdinand and Donald Trump share almost nothing in common, apart from their Scottish heritage, and an unexpected interaction on social media.


	The alternative rock outfit is currently in Australia for a national tour, kicking Wednesday, Nov. 26 at Red Hill Auditorium in Perth, Western Australia, and visiting Brisbane, Thirroul and Melbourne, before wrapping up in Sydney. 


	As the “Take Me Out” singers bang the drum for those dates, frontman Alex Kapronos stopped by Triple M for a chat with WA-based breakfast show hosts Robbie & Carly.

	Conversation, naturally, turned to the weather — where the band has come from, and the blazing heat they've arrived in — and the political climate.


	The band penned the 2016 track “Demagogue” when Trump was still a candidate for the presidential election, which he went on to win, against most political observers' predictions.


	With “Demagogue,” Franz Ferdinand proved once more that Scots don't mince their words.


	“From the wall straight to la cuenta/Those pussy grabbing fingers won't let go of me now,” the sing early on. And later, “From the mob to chapter eleven/Those tiny vulgar fingers on the nuclear bomb.”


	When asked the band had heard from Trump's camp, Kapronos quipped: “He's a sensitive chap, isn't he? When we wrote that song, he was only just going forward as a candidate. We were writing from the perspective of, ‘Oh God, imagine if…' And here we are… we don't need to imagine anymore.”


	Kapronos “didn't hear anything back from him personally, although years ago he replied to a tweet of mine, which was bizarre,” he reveals. Also, one of Trump's daughters “crashed backstage at one of our shows back in 2004,” he recounts. “It was like, ‘Who's this woman in our dressing room?'”

	











	The band has begun their tour down under at the best possible time. “We left a very rainy, cold, dark Europe to come to a beautiful springtime Australia — and you feel that energy,” Kapronos remarks. “It lifts you up. Even if you're hungover or jet-lagged, the energy of the crowd is transformative.”


	Also, Kapranos notes, the group's Perth show will something of a family affair. “My sister's husband is a Perth boy, so we know quite a few folk here. I think we've got a guest list of 60! Perth feels like nowhere else on earth: the trees, the plants, the wildlife, it's so unique.”


	Formed in Glasgow in 2002, Franz Ferdinand has landed seven U.K. top 10 albums, including a No. 1 with 2005's You Could Have It So Much Better, and scooped best British group and best rock act at the BRIT Award in the same year.


	Their U.S. chart story includes two hits on the Billboard Hot 100, and five appearances on the Billboard 200, including two top 10s.

Never let it be said that South Park isn't grateful for its ability to be a lot more timely than almost any other animated show on television, allowing the Comedy Central series to tackle almost any aspect of our modern political and social clusterfuck (that isn't the influence of any billionaires who might be personal friends with Trey Parker and Matt Stone, anyway). Certainly, no other cartoon on TV has now dived in more gleefully in tackling recent criticisms of American athletes and artists taking money from the government of Saudi Arabia, as the series did with its pre-Thanksgiving installment, “Turkey Trot.”

The episode—reportedly the penultimate episode of South Park‘s bizarrely truncated 28th season—dealt with a bunch of the usual suspects, lightly touching on the show's ongoing Trump plotline (albeit without going to the graphic lengths it recently achieved), and allowing Eric Cartman to once again be a force of town-wide menace. (In this case, getting obsessed with “race science,” which involves him recruiting South Park's one Black kid onto his team to try to win the titular event.) Oh, and it got some swipes at Pete Hesgeth in there, but Hesgeth is so obviously buffoonish that even the series seems to realize that clowning on him—by depicting him as a rampant attention seeker in a fight with Kristi Noem to see who can milk more attention out of any given situation—is at least a little bit redundant.

As it usually has over the last few months, South Park reserved its actual satire for chunkier material, in this case the controversy surrounding the recent Riyadh Comedy Festival, and some of the comedians who participated in it. To some extent, the show drew from an older playbook, doing a bit of the old “both sides” maneuver: Having usual moral voice Token repeatedly try to drop out of the town's Saudi-backed Turkey Trot over the queasy feelings associated with taking Saudi money, only to have Cartman point out that ostracized regimes rarely improve on topics like human rights abuses. Or, to put it in the show's terms, asking if he wouldn't prefer “them to pay America for sports rather than hacking up reporters and paying Pete Davidson to do comedy?” (Kevin Hart also took a similar hit.) Putting the words in Cartman's mouth certainly suggests that the series is ascribing cynical motivations somewhere, but it still makes South Park one of the only mainstream American TV shows—outside of, like the news, and the late-night programs—that's directly addressing the controversy.

	Gaines helmed the movie from a script he co-wrote with Qasim Basir that is based on Amiri Baraka's play Dutchman. Gaines produces the project alongside Jonathan T. Baker. Stephen McKinley Henderson, Aldis Hodge, Lauren E. Banks and Lenny Platt round out the cast for the film that premiered earlier this year at SXSW.


	“The Dutchman is a bold, electrifying adaptation that captures the raw power of Amiri Baraka's play with unflinching style and urgency — exactly the kind of provocative, conversation-starting cinema that audiences are starving for right now,” says Inaugural Entertainment founder Kevin Weisberg. “For Inaugural Entertainment it is the exact type of film we can't wait to put in theater.” 

	











	Adds Gaines, “Rogue and Inaugural are the perfect partners to bring The Dutchman to audiences across the country. Marc [Danon], Mike [Arrieta], Kevin and Ryan [Adams] have been champions of this film since day one, which means the world to me. Bringing The Dutchman to theaters nationwide is not just a dream come true — it's an opportunity for audiences to engage with a story that demands to be felt, enjoyed and discussed.” 


	In her review of The Dutchman for The Hollywood Reporter, critic Lovia Gyarkye wrote that Gaines “intensifies the dramatic work's surrealist undertones and takes the central couple's story above ground.” Gyarkye added that moving the narrative beyond the play's train car gives the film “greater contemporary resonance.”

SPOILER ALERT: This post spoils Volume 1 of Stranger Things Season 5 – the entire first four episodes.


	Father and daughter duo Jim Hopper (David Harbour) and Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) are back in action in the fifth and final season of Stranger Things.


	Following behind-the-scenes rumors of tension between the costars with a reported harassment and bullying complaint filed against Harbour by Brown, the actress reflected on her working relationship with Harbour given that most of her scenes in the first four episodes of Stranger Things Season 5 Volume 1 take place with him in The Upside Down.

	











	“David and I have a great relationship. We work really closely together in the scenes and in preparing for the scenes. I really am excited for everyone to see the labor of love and hard work we've put into the closure of our relationship and what that looks like and to give some of the fans,” she told Deadline. “Especially the Hopper and Eleven fans. Those scenes that I feel, I think, are going to be quite impactful. I love it. It makes me want to bring my A game every single time I see that I'm on the call sheet working with him because I know he's bringing it right back.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Brown affirmed that she felt safe going to emotional depths with Harbour when Eleven is compromised by what they call “kryptonite” or the satellite technology that paralyzes her and renders her powers useless.


	“Of course, I felt safe. We've worked together for 10 years. I feel safe with everyone on that set. Naturally [we]'ve been doing it for so long,” she said. “We also play father and daughter, so naturally you have a closer bond than the rest because we have had some really intense scenes together, especially in Season 2.”

	Season 2 watched the start of Hopper and El's relationship when he took her in after she disappeared saving the four boys from a Demogorgon in the Season 1 finale. At one point, Eleven compared Hop to Dr. Brenner, who she calls Papa, because he wouldn't let her leave his cabin, and the scene is known to be a heated one.


	“It's definitely sometimes a wake up call because it's a year-long filming, so every scene you go, ‘Okay, am I gonna give it 150% today? Because I have this huge scene tomorrow.' And you have to be honest with yourself,” Brown said. “I would have been exhausted. It's very taxing. So you really have to choose the moments that you are going to lock in and the moments that you go, ‘Okay. This is more emotional today. This is more expositional today.' You have to map it out, and I do physically. I highlight my pages by color, with emotion, and also weekdays and that helps me plan out what my week looks like and what kind of emotions I have to harness.”


	In addition to mentally emotional scenes, Brown also has some very involved stunts because Eleven has leveled up her powers.

	“I love stunts. I love that element of El. I can't lie. It taught me a lot about stamina. It just helped me train entirely with stamina. Doing that for 13 hours a day outside when it's cold, your body doesn't know it's acting,” she said. “Your body does physically think it's being thrown in the air. Your body does think it's going through something traumatic. So it's it's kind of connecting your mind, body and spirit, and really locking in to that.”


	“I can be thrown in the air, [but] if my face isn't doing the thing I need it to, then it doesn't work. But then also ‘Okay, you throw your left hand behind the wire. You're entirely twisted in the whole take is off,” Brown continued. “It's like riding a horse. The horse knows exactly what the human is doing on top of the horse, they can feel every single limb. So you have to lock in to yourself and stay in tune with yourself. And that, I have never done more in my work, so this season, I think I've threw myself into that quite heavily.”

SPOILER ALERT! This post contains major plot details from the first four episodes of Netflix‘s Stranger Things 5.


	The Duffer Brothers drop a huge bombshell on audiences in the final moments of Stranger Things 5 Vol. 1, and it has to do with Will Byers (Noah Schnapp).


	Will has always had a connection to the Upside Down, considering he was the first kid in Hawkins to disappear into Vecna's clutches. Since his mom Joyce (Winona Ryder) and Hawkins Police Chief Jim Hopper (David Harbour) found him in the Hawkins Library at the end of Season 1, he's continued to have a sixth sense for everything relating to the alternate dimension. But, even though his kidnapping is the catalyst for the entire series, Will has taken somewhat of a backseat in recent seasons.

	That's not the case anymore, as evidenced by the final moments of Season 5 Vol. 1. As Demogorgons are wreaking havoc on the MAC-Z, and Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) is preoccupied in the Upside Down, the rest of the Hawkins crew is left to figure this hellish situation one out on their own. Just as it seems like all hope is lost and the monsters are about to overpower them, something strange happens. All of the Demogorgons freeze mid-air…and Will is the one telekinetically holding them back. As the episode ends, Will looks up and wipes the blood dripping from his nose.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In our story on crafting that final scene, Schnapp and Brown make it clear the Will's super powers will manifest differently than Eleven's, though they possess some similarities.

	











	The revelation about Will possessing some sort of powers comes amid what Schnapp describes as Will's “self-acceptance journey” throughout the first four episodes of the final season, particularly as it related to the interest he's taken in Robin (Maya Hawke) and her relationship with Vickie (Amybeth McNulty). 


	“When we first started talking about Season 5, we started talking about Will. He was a little bit more out of the picture in Season 4, but he's a central character. He's the character who kicked it all off, and a lot of this season was about going full circle and going back to the beginning, which raised questions about how he vanished and whatnot,” Matt Duffer tells Deadline. “But more than that, this was about Will's journey in terms of finding out really who he was, and coming to terms with that. So we liked the idea of tying that into some of the more supernatural elements, that in order to become his most powerful self, he had to also really come to terms with who he is. We thought there would be no one better to help him with that than Robin, who had gone through that journey herself in Season 3. So that was an early idea to pair the two of them together. In real life, Maya and Noah have a very sweet bond. So it we knew that the two of them were going to work really well together.”


	In the conversation below, Schnapp unpacks how Will's arc in Vol. 1 leads to that face off with Vecna in the final moments of Episode 4 and teases what we should expect from the remainder of Stranger Things 5.


DEADLINE: The season opens with a flashback to right after Will gets kidnapped in the Upside Down. How much did you know about where this all was headed over the course of filming?


NOAH SCHNAPP: I did not really know much at all until we read the scripts at the table read, really. I mean, I had an idea, maybe, after Season 4. We finished, and we talked on the phone about wanting to explore the whys of why I was taken in the first place, but not to the extent we see, until I really read the script.


DEADLINE: So, how did that flashback aid you in your performance in Season 5?


SCHNAPP: Well, knowing that definitely helped me play, in Season 5, this stronger version of him, when we realize he is a lot stronger than we thought, and trying to get to that point.


DEADLINE: I think that's an important point, because at the end of Episode 4, Vecna says he's been targeting ‘weak' children and he says that Will folded so easily. But we see that is not entirely the case. Do you think Vecna underestimates Will?


SCHNAPP: Oh, absolutely. I think people mistake fear for weakness. Will has had a lot of fear through the years, because of what he's had to endure, but that doesn't mean he's weak. He's pushed through that and come out stronger, and he does it scared every time. He always comes back, and he never crumbles. So that is his strength, and I think he shows that in the end, that he is stronger than we all think. 


DEADLINE: How do you think that conversation with Joyce (Winona Ryder) earlier in Vol. 1, when he tells her he needs to put himself in danger if it means saving his friends, leads him to this moment at the end of 504?


SCHNAPP: Joyce has always been such an overly protective figure for him, which, I mean, in good reason. He was kidnapped from such a young age, but I think her being able to believe in him, and Robin giving him those words of affirmation helped him believe in himself. I think it was nice. It kind of mirrored my relationship with Winona in real life, where I kind of wasn't the kid looking up to her as much as seeing eye-to-eye at this point.

	











DEADLINE: After Mike spends so much time telling Will that he thinks he has powers…what's going through Will's head in that moment he looks up and wipes the blood off his nose?


SCHNAPP: I think he's just so wrapped up in the other world, he's not [aware]. I tried to show that it's not that scared Will, like he is stronger than we've seen before. I kind of channeled, like, a gorilla to feel that power and that strength. 


DEADLINE: How was it logistically to film that scene?


SCHNAPP:  It was insane. We did rehearsals for weeks before, which we'd never done before. The VFX Department made a pre-vis video where they animated out the whole sequence to map it, and then the stunt department filmed a version on their iPhones to map it out. So we had all these guides to follow through the rehearsals. Then on that day, we did a oner so we really had to have rehearsed it perfectly to get it done. Then [for] another week, it was just me kind of having fun on the playground that was that set.


DEADLINE: What did you make of the growing connection between Will and Robin this season?


SCHNAPP: I loved it. I was always wanting to work with Maya, so getting to be paired with her this season was such a joy, and I feel like our friendship on the show kind of mirrored our real-life friendship as well. I always looked up to her, and she was really a role model for me.


DEADLINE: What do you think is making Will gravitate toward her this season?


SCHNAPP:  I mean, he sees a little bit of himself in her and sees a confident, more assured version of himself. So he wants to emulate that. How does he do that? He has to get to know her and learn how she reached that. 


DEADLINE: We obviously see Will's memories and the words from Robin replaying in his head right before he flexes his powers for the first time…but what do you think that her speech about having all the answers inside herself unlocked for him?


SCHNAPP: I mean, it was kind of his self-acceptance journey had come to a close, and he finally made acceptance with who he really was. Once he allowed that, he could fly and he could unleash the power within him. I think it really resonates, not just with our queer audience, but with anyone who learns to believe in themselves and accept them wholeheartedly for who they are, they can do great things. It tells a beautiful message.


DEADLINE: You've spoken quite a bit about Will's sexuality. How is that and his growing relationship with Robin connected to him coming into his own with his powers?


SCHNAPP: He sees someone who overcame what he wants to overcome. So he's trying to learn more about that. He really sees a role model in Robin. So just trying to get any information he can out of her without explicitly saying why is kind of the goal for him.


DEADLINE: Will he ever be confident enough to speak that truth?


SCHNAPP: I guess we will have to wait and see.


DEADLINE: What do you think audiences should be thinking and feeling heading into Vol. 2?


SCHNAPP: Well, for Will, we start to learn the parallels between Will and Vecna, and it almost felt very Harry Potter to me that I had to go back and re-watch the movies, because the Harry Potter-Voldemort relationship felt very close to Will and Vecna. So just exploring those parallels and what that means.


DEADLINE: Did you rewatch any of the early Stranger Things seasons?


SCHNAPP: Yes, definitely that too was prep for the season, because we tie so much back to Seasons 1 and 2. So I did rewatch the whole thing, and just [tried] to manufacture these full circle moments in scenes or settings or in costumes, to make it feel nostalgic to the beginning.

	











DEADLINE: What was it like to rewatch those early seasons?


SCHNAPP: Oh, it's so special. Even watching Season 5. I'm watching Episode 1 like, ‘Whoa.' I was in such a different place. It really helps you reflect and get taken right back to that point in your life. But it's so special that I get to have this kind of 4k resolution filmed video footage of myself as a 10-year-old that I get to keep with me forever.


DEADLINE: How have you reflected on being part of this franchise for 10 years?


SCHNAPP:  I definitely have grown with each season and with more experience. I'm never perfect, and I'm still figuring and learning new things out, but I feel like grown in the fact that I'm more confident and sure of what works and what doesn't, and have grown to have a real point of view on what I believe should be done, whereas when I was younger, I was kind of just like going with the flow and being told what to do.


DEADLINE: Are you feeling satisfied with the conclusion of the series?


SCHNAPP: Of course, I feel very satisfied and excited for all our characters and how the show wraps up. I think it does a great job closing everyone's individual story and doing a service to all of them.

The Japanese film was released more than a decade before the first 'Hunger Games' installment.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Quentin Tarantino has some strong opinions about the billion-dollar-grossing Hunger Games franchise.


	During a recent interview on The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast, the two-time Oscar-winning filmmaker accused The Hunger Games of ripping off the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale. Tarantino has regularly placed the movie, which was based on author Koushun Takami's 1999 novel of the same name, on his favorite movies list.




	“I do not understand how the Japanese writer didn't sue Suzanne Collins for every fucking thing she owns,” he said. “They just ripped off the fuckin' book. Stupid book critics are not going to go watch a Japanese movie called Battle Royale so the stupid book critics never called her on it. They talked about how it was the most original fuckin' thing they'd ever read. As soon as the film critics saw the film, they said, ‘What the fuck? This is just Battle Royale except PG!'”

	The similarities between the two stories have long been compared since the first Hunger Games installment, led by Jennifer Lawrence, dropped in 2012.


Battle Royale was set in a dystopian future in Japan and followed a group of junior high students who are forced by a totalitarian government to fight to the death in a competition until only one remains. The Hunger Games is also a dystopian series, which centers on a televised competition in which two teens from each of the twelve districts in the fictional nation of Panem are chosen at random to fight to the death.

	











	Collins, who wrote The Hunger Games books, has previously denied that her series was based on Battle Royale. “I had never heard of that book or that author until my book was turned in,” she told The New York Times in 2011. “At that point, it was mentioned to me, and I asked my editor if I should read it. He said, ‘No, I don't want that world in your head. Just continue with what you're doing.'”


	After Battle Royale was released in 2000, a sequel followed in 2003 called Battle Royale II: Requiem. As for The Hunger Games, five films have been released in the franchise since the first installment in 2012, with a sixth one, Sunrise on the Reaping, set to his theaters in 2026.

One of the knock-on effects of a new generation of TV and film creators recreating, rebooting, or simply reviving the work of earlier writers and directors is that the new breed often turn out to have been outright fans of what the old guard was up to. That's certainly the case with Chloé Zhao's efforts to revive Buffy The Vampire Slayer, with the Hamnet co-writer and director taking some time out of her press tour (for the very somber Shakespearean child-death drama) to wrestle with equally weighty issues of a more modern vintage: Angel, or Spike?

This is per an interview Zhao recently did with Lauren Veneziani, a.k.a. DC Film Girl, who immediately turned the conversation away from Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, and toward Buffy ‘shipping talk. Zhao was just as game, though, especially on the topic of which of Buffy Summers' various boyfriends she rooted for in the series—provoking a possible schism when she revealed that she was in the camp of James Marsters' Spike, not Veneziani's preferred bloodsucker, David Boreanaz's Angel. (Détente was reached when both women acknowledged that Marc Blucas' Riley has grown on them over the years, for the basic reason of not being an emotionally repressed 300-year-old adolescent.)

Mostly, though, it's just interesting to see Zhao fully fan out about the original series, speaking in a way that makes it clear that she's still super-invested in its stories of supernatural horror blending into young adult angst. That includes a very sweet story she told about the wrap for the revived show's pilot episode: After being told by Sarah Michelle Gellar—the only cast member from the original who's been confirmed to appear in the revival—that she hadn't kept the “Class Protector” trophy from the show's famous prom episode, Zhao got her prop department to whip up a new version of the glittery little umbrella, and presented it to Gellar on the final day of shooting. (Complete with delivering her version of Danny Strong's speech from one of the show's most heartwarming moments. Very sweet!)

Zhao's Buffy revival—which she's described as a “continuation” of the original series—is set to land on Hulu. No release date has been offered.

The podcaster, who is happily married to Jelly Roll, recounts her own experience with domestic violence in 2013-2016.

	While many of us are kicking back, feet up and chomping down on roast turkey with all the trimmings, Bunnie Xo is on a different type of mission this Thanksgiving.

	Bunnie is knuckling down to help women escaping domestic violence.


	The podcaster and her team are providing Thanksgiving dinner and care packages for women in transitional housing at the Mary Parrish Center, in search of a fresh start, a safer life.

	“Thanksgiving is about giving back. And that's exactly what we're doing today,” Bunnie tells Extra.


	Bunnie tells Extra she knows from experience how tough it can be out there. “Going through a situation personally around 2013 to 2016 with my own domestic violence relationship has just made this mission for myself,” she remarks, “even more of wanting to give back and wanting to be there for the women and the children that are going through this because I know how hard it is to get out.”


	Now happily married now to country star Jelly Roll, Bunnie hasn't forgotten those harrowing days, which she recounts in her new book “Stripped Down.”


	As Thanksgiving approaches, Bunnie shared a stark image of spousal abuse — a photo of her with a swollen black eye. The intention of posting the shocking photo, she says, is “that women could see like, ‘Okay, she's been where I'm at and she gets it.' I want somebody that I can relate to, and I hope that these women know that I have been exactly where they are and I just want to lift them up and just make them feel so good and loved and know that they're doing the right thing.”

	











	She adds, “I just want them to keep going. Don't ever look back. Smash the rearview mirror.”


	Just a week ago, Bunnie put up her hand and confessed to some past errors of her own, which could result in jail time. Speaking on her Dumb Blonde podcast, the host admitted that she has to turn herself in to serve time for unknowingly driving for years with a suspended license, those issues apparently tying back to a minor driving incident from half a decade ago.


	“I got my lawyer on it, whatever,” she explained. “It looks like your girl is gonna have to go book herself in. If I do — you guys have seen all my past mug shots — I'm going in glammed the f–k up, baby, and I'm going to vlog it.”


	Watch the full piece on Bunnie's Thanksgiving mission below on Extra, now in its 32nd with host Derek Hough.

Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas addressed their controversial “Dancing With the Stars” elimination during their appearance on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast Wednesday.

Leavitt and Ballas were shockingly eliminated in the semi-finals of Season 34 of “DWTS,” after receiving high scores from the judges all season. However, the “Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” star, 32, didn't score well in the fan vote and she received intense backlash for having previous dance experience.

Leavitt laughed off the criticism when asked about it by “Call Your Daddy” host Alex Cooper. She noted that while she did have a modern dance degree from Brigham Young University, the style of dancing on “DWTS” was definitely foreign to her.

“Dancing with a partner in this capacity is so new to me, so different,” she insisted. “Of course, that background helped learning different techniques but this was still very new to me.”

She also said she stopped dancing after having her three kids.

“I'd like, go take a class maybe once in a while, but no I was not actively dancing,” she said.

Ballas pointed out that there hasn't been a season of “DWTS” where there wasn't a contestant with previous dancing experience, like past winners Nicole Scherzinger and Jordan Fisher. He said fans noticed it more with Leavitt because of her natural performance abilities.

“She is a dynamic performer and that's something I can't teach,” he said.

The conversation later took a dark turn when Ballas shared how the hate he and Leavitt received this season affected him. Leavitt was criticized after admitting on Season 3 of “The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” that she only agreed to come back to the reality show for a chance to audition for “DWTS.”

Ballas said that in all of his past seasons on “DWTS,” he had never seen fans actively band together to vote for every other couple just to force them out of the competition. He also got emotional while reading a hateful comment directed toward him online that called him “a c—nt,” “worthless” and wished he burned in hell.

Ballas said he didn't sign up for that type of hate and only wanted to be on a fun dancing competition that brought people joy.

For her part, Leavitt said she was used to the hate but was more affected by seeing Ballas experience it for the first time. She gave a feisty response when Cooper asked if she had a message for her haters.

“I don't know because what I would want to say is, ‘F—k you,'” she said as she and Ballas laughed.

As Leavitt was indisputably one of the best dancers, technique-wise, in the competition, plenty of fans were disappointed when she and Ballas didn't get to perform their freestyle dance — one of the most anticipated performances all season long due to its anything-goes nature — in the finals.

The podcast and ABC actually built a set for the two to perform what would have been their freestyle dance, and they performed a dazzling routine to Frank Sinatra's “My Way.”

Leavitt appeared in a showgirl costume before stripping down to a bedazzled long-sleeved leotard. At one point, she smeared red lipstick on her face during the dramatic dance.

The performance ended with a message reading, “Social media is bad for your health.”

Robert Irwin ended up winning the Mirrorball Trophy on Tuesday with his partner, Witney Carson, after an epic three-hour finale. Irwin — a frontrunner all season long — praised his older sister, Bindi Irwin, who won the Mirrorball Trophy in 2015 with her partner, Derek Hough.

“To follow in those footsteps and to do the same has meant everything to me,” the 21-year-old Australian conservationist told People after the show's finale. “This has absolutely changed my life.”

Robert told the outlet Bindi's win a decade ago was special because it allowed their family to inform the public about their conservation work, charity and the Australia Zoo and Wildlife Warriors.

“It's about making the world a better place. And when I watched her lift that Mirrorball, I saw her lifting that message,” he said.

[Note: This article contains spoilers for this week's episode of Pluribus.]

There's a whole long and complicated conversation to be had about tricking actors into getting particular reactions out of them, much of it rooted in the sense that, if you've hired a bunch of professionals to pretend to say and feel things, surprising them to get more “genuine” responses is kind of questionable. That being said, sometimes it's done simply for the fun of the prank, which was apparently the case with a recent joke pulled on star Rhea Seehorn on the set of her new Apple TV+ show Pluribus.

Specifically, Seehorn was not informed that, when she picked up an on-set phone to hear an answering machine message left for her by the rest of the world—with the show's psychically Joined populace explaining they need some “space” from Carol Sturka's general hostility—that it'd be the voice of one of her old Better Call Saul castmates on the other end of the line. “They surprised me. I did not know about this,” Seehorn told TV Guide when she realized that Patrick “Howard Hamlin” Fabian had been tapped to play the voice on the other end of the line.

“They were hoping to get some kind of blooper take from me, but I was so terrified to mess up a take,” Seehorn said. “Not terrified, but I just didn't want to—because I knew it was a long take, too, the first time she hears it.” Seehorn says she didn't know which take of the scene made it into the episode's cut, but “I think if you got one of those psychologists or psychiatrists that study micro facial muscle changes, I'm pretty sure you could see me go, “What? Patrick?“ But then I tried to cover and play the scene.” Once the work was done, Seehorn allowed herself a reaction: “They called cut, and I started laughing and ran out and said, ‘That's Patrick! You got Patrick!' And they said they'd been sitting on it for a long time, just to screw with me.” (Seehorn also noted that, besides the Vince Gilligan connection, “Patrick Fabian does have one of the all-time great voices that I would imagine that the Others would have voted as one of the most soothing voices to be on the outgoing message. So I understand the decision.”)

[Editor's note: The recap of episodes three and four publishes November 27.]   

Raise your hand if you're a Stranger Things viewer who has complained about how long it's been since the show last aired. It would be impossible not to, considering the three-and-a-half-year hiatus between seasons four and five, or the series' overall lengthy run. It premiered in the sweaty summer of 2016, the same year when The Good Place, This Is Us, Westworld, Insecure, Better Things, and Lucifer debuted. Each of those other shows' multi-season runs are over, but not Stranger Things, which has aired only 34 episodes in almost 10 years (not counting anything in 2025). If that's not damning evidence of the current streaming era's issues, what is? Then again, ST launched when our TV landscape was figuring all this out, considering Netflix had blown up with House Of Cards and Orange Is The New Black, Hulu and Prime Video originals were finding their footing, and platforms like Apple TV, Peacock, and Disney+ didn't even exist. 

In many ways, Stranger Things was once emblematic of the binge-watching norm. I vividly remember completing season one the day it dropped and being enamored by its '80s nostalgia, terrific young performers, gripping storyline, and Winona Ryder. Of course, I realized I'd have to wait for a while for more, and that has morphed into a defining Stranger Things experience, particularly with how grown-up the kids look. The show is an example of why not to drag something out past its peak. Even this final run—which has good things going for it—is divided into three parts to dull the fun. If they wanted to keep the momentum during the holidays, why not opt for a sensible one-episode-per-week schedule? Netflix (seemingly) would never. So we have less than half a season out, most of which feels like entertaining table-setting for another showdown between our favorite Hawkins residents and Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower), who apparently went missing after his physical body was set ablaze by Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer) and Robin Buckley (Maya Hawke) in the season-four finale.  

“The Crawl” and “The Vanishing Of Holly Wheeler” save his onscreen reappearance till the last minute, when he drops in his human form, Henry Creel, and not as the veiny mouthbreather. That doesn't mean his evil plans aren't taking root or that his disgusting demogorgon pets aren't wreaking bloody havoc—just ask the Wheelers. Those elements remain the driving force of the action, as seen in episode two's thrilling opening scene at their home. But the co-creators, brothers Matt and Ross Duffer, don't stray from a well-defined routine. It's classic Stranger Things at this point: The whole group discovers the latest mess they're in before splitting into teams (either on purpose or by accident) with separate tasks that end in a common goal of saving someone and destroying the enemy. Throw in lighthearted banter, pop-culture references galore, Hopper (David Harbour) losing his patience, Joyce (Ryder) worrying for her kids, at least one friend being distant (this time it's Dustin, not Max), and Nancy trapped in ridiculous relationship drama. Actually, it's unforgivable that precious time is still being spent on a battle of the brawn between Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) and Steve (Joe Keery). Their love triangle remains one of the show's least interesting parts, especially now that Nancy has emerged as a badass leader. Why is her arc getting bogged down by the dudes? At least Steve's character development has been commendable, but the writers have had no idea what to do with Jonathan for a long time. 

But back to “The Crawl.” Rockin' Robin catches us up through her radio show, which she uses as a way to send messages to her secret girlfriend, candy striper Vickie (Amybeth McNulty), and her pals. In the 18 months since the Upside Down gates opened up, Hawkins has been under lockdown. That hasn't stopped our crew from commandeering “crawls.” Specifically, Hop takes trips to the flipside, hiding in the back of government cars that go into the Upside Down because, yes, the military has established an entire base there. Gone are the days when Nancy discovered secret, gooey entrances in trees or when El's powers were needed to open a portal. Now, Nancy orchestrates the mission, making plans and taking notes. Joyce (Ryder) communicates with everyone through the walkie-talkies; Mike (Finn Wolfhard) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) are the spotters; Steve is the driver; Dustin operates the telemetry tracker to keep up with Hop in the Upside Down. They've done this 36 times with the hope that Hop will figure out where Vecna is hiding. For her part, El has been obsessively training and strengthening her powers for their upcoming fight. 

The 37th crawl, as it plays out in the episode, goes haywire quickly. Dustin is MIA, having been beaten up by bullies at Eddie Munson's (Joseph Quinn) grave because he won't stop wearing the Hellfire T-shirt and provoking his seniors to bully him. In his absence, Jonathan takes over the job. But the van Hop jumps into gets run over by demogorgons in the Upside Down, sending him to hide in the woods by himself. In the real Hawkins, Will still gets the “goosies” when Vecna is around. So he knows the entity is close. In fact, his abilities go a step further now, so he can do more than sense a presence. He can literally see through Vecna's eyes or the demogorgons when they're bracing to attack. This fits into his evolution; he was in Vecna's grasp—as seen in the premiere's cold open—in ways beyond his comprehension. And since he's been freed, he's developed heightened abilities. That's how he knows that a creature is about to tear through the Wheeler house to kidnap sweet, young Holly. Nancy and Mike's sister is Vecna's latest target because she's lonely and vulnerable, much like Will was when he was taken in season one. Vecna has been popping up in her life as her imaginary friend, whom she dubs Mr. Whatsit after Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle In Time. 

Holly tells her brother that Mr. Whatsit has been warning her about the monsters living in Hawkins and that they're coming after her. The scene they share seems essential for many reasons. It reminds us of their bond, sure, but also of the fact that most people in town are unaware of the true danger lurking around the corner. Even now, Mike doesn't warn his sister. Instead of prepping her, he gives her a D&D figurine, dubbing her Heroic Holly. Everything he says about this character—she has divine powers, can cast spells, can teleport to a dimension door—feels like foreshadowing in the same vein as Will saying in the series premiere that “the demogorgon got me” before getting on his bicycle to go home.  

Mike and Nancy are unable to stop a Demogorgon from attacking their family. By the time Will alerts Nancy, and she reaches home with El in tow, it's too late. In a spectacular fight, Karen finally learns about these “monsters,” going into Joyce Byers mode to protect her young daughter. Unfortunately, I chuckled when the weapon she confidently goes for is her wine bottle, using it to repeatedly injure the demogorgon—all while wearing a soaking wet nightgown. This is the only time I'll be saying these words: go Karen! The buildup and payoff to this scene in both episodes is exactly why Stranger Things still hits. Karen's fighting spirit doesn't help because the demogorgon slashes her throat, so when Nancy walks in, she finds her mother badly hurt on the kitchen floor and her sibling gone. She sends El straight into an Upside Down, where she reunites with her father figure. As frustrated as Hop is that El came out of hiding, the show gives them a significant bonding moment as they follow the demogorgon's trail. Except they hit a dead end when they come face to face with a giant wall—think Game Of Thrones level—made of the slimy goo found in this realm. We don't know what's behind it, but it's safe to assume that it's the place where Henry/Vecna takes Holly, a sort of sunny mind palace that resembles his house when he was alive. 

For their part, Nancy, Mike, and Lucas conclude that Mr. Whatsit might not be so imaginary and could provide answers—if only they could figure out who he is. So it takes a needlessly complicated scene, in which the Wheeler siblings are forced to dress up as a nurse and patient, for them to see their own recovering mother. (Seriously, some of this stuff could've been edited out so the episodes aren't as long.) Karen spells out the name she's heard Holly call her “pal,” and…dun, dun, dun. Will also learns that Vecna's next target is Holly's classmate Derek Turnbow (Jake Connelly). And now, everyone knows Henry Creel has definitely set his sights on a new generation of kids. As I said, it's more of the same with Stranger Things, but at least our faves now know what they're up against and will prepare for the impending war accordingly.

Robert Irwin and Xochitl Gomez shared a special moment just hours before his “Dancing With the Stars” victory.

Ahead of Tuesday night's Season 34 finale, the actress was spotted visiting Irwin on set and gifting him a bouquet of flowers.

Gomez, chic in a long black strapless dress with gold buttons and a detached collar, looked giddy while conversing with the zookeeper outside of his trailer.

Irwin was sporting his first dance costume of the night — a sparkly black button-up with coordinating bejeweled pants — while chatting with Gomez.

The encounter appeared to be filled with smiles and laughter between the two, which naturally fueled fan speculation that the pair could be romantically involved.

A source told Page Six that Irwin, 21, and Gomez, 19, have been enjoying each other's company since connecting through the dance competition show.

It's unclear, however, whether they're anything more than just close friends.

“Xochitl is the sweetest person,” the source said, adding, “They are having a lot of fun. They're both extroverts with a lot of energy.”

Despite fans of the show “shipping” them online, Gomez confirmed she was “single” on the show's TikTok livestream moments before the finale, according to People. 

The livestream was co-hosted by “DWTS” pros Jan Ravnik and Brandon Armstrong, who asked Gomez point-blank if she was single.

“Yes, I am,” the actress confirmed, laughing. “Yes, yes, I am.”

Reps for Irwin and Gomez did not immediately respond to Page Six's requests for comment.

Meanwhile, another insider expressed how happy “everyone” is for Irwin and his dance partner, Witney Carson, after their exciting win.

“Everyone around Robert is so happy he won the Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy,” the source gushed. “You can tell he was well-liked on set amongst the cast and crew.”

Robert was in Los Angeles Tuesday night for the finale and flew to New York City overnight for an early “Good Morning America” appearance on Wednesday.

We're told he is heading to Africa and will be back in his native Australia by Thursday.

Gomez gushed over Irwin and Carson's victory in a video of the winning moment shared via her Instagram Story.

“I'm so incredibly proud of you two! What a season!❤️✨,” the “Marvel” star captioned the post. 

Fans started speculating about a possible romance between the two after Gomez — who won Season 32 of the dance competition series — returned to the ballroom for the series' 20th anniversary episode.

She and Irwin lit up the dance floor with an exciting routine at the time.

The duo performed an energetic jive to “Dance With Me Tonight” by Olly Murs — winning the dance relay against Alix Earle and former “DWTS” champion Joey Graziadei. 

Last month, Irwin exclusively spoke with Page Six about his dating life, addressing the influx of messages he's received from fans and potential suitors on his quest to find an “American girl.”

“Oh my goodness, the DMs,” Irwin said, laughing. “First of all, it just means so, so much. But, yeah, I'm on the lookout and it'll happen when it happens … keep it coming!”

He's not the only one catching extra attention from viewers. Both his pro dance partner and his sister, former “DWTS” champion Bindi Irwin, have also been flooded with messages from girls since the show aired — asking them to connect them to Robert.

“We are so busy right now, girls, OK?” Carson joked. “We're trying to win a Mirrorball. So, settle down! Maybe don't email me a hundred times a day.”

Robert secured the coveted trophy 10 years after Bindi, 27, won the Season 21 championship with her dance partner, Derek Hough. She was in the ballroom Tuesday night to celebrate her bro's big win.

	The estate of Johnny Cash is suing Coca-Cola, accusing the company of hiring a tribute singer to imitate the country singer's voice illegally for a college football ad, as Billboard reports.


	The federal complaint filed Tuesday in Nashville is the first major case to come under Tennessee's Ensuring Likeness Voice and Image Security Act (ELVIS) Act. Enacted in 2024, the ELVIS Act expanded the state's statutory right of publicity to protect a person's voice from being exploited.


	The manager of Cash's estate, the John R. Cash Revocable Trust, cited a song in a commercial, which has been airing since August during college football games. In the lawsuit, the estate claims that the voice in the ad sounds “remarkably” like Cash's, and that it is the voice of a performer named Shawn Barker, who is a professional Cash tribute performer.

	“Stealing the voice of an artist is theft. It is theft of his integrity, identity and humanity,” Tim Warnock of Loeb & Loeb, a lawyer for Cash's estate, wrote. “The trust brings this lawsuit to protect the voice of Johnny Cash — and to send a message that protects the voice of all of the artists whose music enriches our lives.”

	











	While the Cash estate does license the late performer's intellectual property — such as his songs “Ragged Old Flag” and “Personal Jesus,” which were used in Super Bowl telecasts — the estate claims Coca-Cola “never even bothered to ask the trust for a license” in the case of this ad where they used a voice sounding like Cash that aired during college football games.

	











	According to the complaint, “This case arises from Coca-Cola's pirating Johnny Cash's voice in a nationwide advertising campaign to enrich itself — without asking for permission or providing any compensation to the humble man and artist who created the goodwill from which Coca-Cola now profits.”


	A rep for Coca-Cola did not immediately return Rolling Stone's request for comment.

	The estate is seeking a court injunction that would remove the ad from airing alongside financial damages over alleged violations of Cash's rights under the ELVIS Act, among seeking other damages.


	While this is the first major case to be brought under the ELVIS Act, the legislation was intended to protect artists against artificial intelligence deepfakes and voice clones. The Cash estate's complaint against Coca-Cola does not allege artificial intelligence was used in the commercial, as Billboard notes.

	You can catch eleven-time Olympic medalist Simone Biles nailing her signature triple-double on the floor in all kinds of sparkling leotards — but one color she returns to again and again is purple. So naturally, when the GOAT of gymnastics launched her fifth collection with clothing company Athleta, she took that iconic hue and wove it through an elevated lineup of leggings, crop tops, and sports bras — all of which you can now score online.


	Freshly released, the new Simone Biles x Athleta collab infuses her personal style into the brand's performance apparel, offering eighteen pieces for women and girls. And while the collection usually goes for full price, it's currently up to 40% off for Athleta's Black Friday Sale.


Rolling Stone sat down with Biles to talk about the collection, whether she'll compete in the 2028 Summer Olympics, and her ongoing work in mental health advocacy and the foster care community. Read the full interview below, and grab the collab while it's still marked down for the biggest shopping holiday of the year. It might just make you feel like a 25-time World Champion.




What made you partner with Athleta?This is my fifth collection with Athleta, and it's definitely the boldest yet. I really wanted it to feel unique and fashion-forward, and I feel like over the past couple of years, I've developed my own sense of style. This collection really reflects that.


Do you have a favorite piece in this new collection?We have a fun accessory, the sateen bucket bag, and I feel like it's a great collaboration. My signature color is purple, so that's why we implemented that color throughout as well.

How do you decide which brands you want to partner with?For this one specifically, they believed in Simone — not just Simone Biles. When you see Simone Biles in the media, it's really easy to jump on board and follow that trend, but they truly believed in me as a person. So it was a very easy partnership. I've been a long-time fan of Athleta since I was twelve years old, and it's a brand by women, so I thought it was a perfect fit. We support each other in the best, most positive way.




Was there anything about the brand that surprised you?I thought the inclusivity factor was amazing. They go from XXS all the way to XL, and they also have tall and petite sizing. For me, as a gymnast, not everyone fits the exact mold, so you have to break those barriers. I wanted my audience to feel included.


How would you describe your personal style?It has fallen into more of an athleisure category, because I'm not in the gym as consistently as when I was training for the Olympics. Right now, my hobbies include horseback riding, and I still get to wear leggings and tight tops. Whenever someone asks what I'm wearing, I'll always tell people about it, but that's just like a girl's girl thing.

Speaking of being in the gym, what's your number-one hype song before you compete?It was always something by Beyoncé or Cardi B, or Megan Thee Stallion.


What do you think of Cardi B's new album, Am I the Drama?Oh, I love it. Every time I get in the car, that's the first thing I put on. It gets me going. I feel like a badass.


I know you haven't committed to the 2028 Summer Olympics yet in Los Angeles, but is there any update?It's only been a year since the last Olympics, so I need to give my body and my mind the break that they need and deserve.

Will you show up to the Winter Olympics this year?I'm trying to go to the Winter Games, so we'll see how I make it work. I want to see some skiing, and I want to go to the ice skating. The Olympics — that's my thing. It's so fun to watch and to show up when I've never been able to do that before. I'm so excited, and I have to get my outfits ready.


You've become a role model for millions. How do you balance that responsibility while staying true to yourself?For me, it's easy. If you had asked when I was 16, it would've been tougher — I was more nervous. But now I try to stay true to my authentic self, and that's what people can relate to: being open, vulnerable, and honest about the things we go through. At the end of the day, most people can't relate to going to the Olympics or winning medals. So on my channels, I try to be myself. It's a huge honor to be a role model to so many young women, girls, and boys across the globe.




Ideally, what would you want the future of women's sports to look like?Oh my God, if you're watching women's sports right now, we're already up on the horizon. We're doing so many amazing things. I think the main thing for women's sports is the conversation around it. If we keep talking about it, they'll continue to get the respect they deserve, which is super exciting. I feel like women's sports have been better these last couple of years than they've ever been before. It's so exciting to watch, to support, to show up — and hopefully to be part of that movement, helping them get the recognition and the pay they deserve. So I'm in support of all of it. It's amazing.

The way you were treated after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the public scrutiny you faced — did that change your opinion on how women are treated in media and sports?I definitely knew what the landscape was like, but now it feels like it's on a different level. It feels heavier. You can't control how people portray you. I'm always going to stay true to myself, to what I do, what I love, what I support, and what I speak out about. Sometimes that comes with scrutiny. In therapy, I just remind myself that I have to look after myself, and that's what matters most at the end of the day.




If you weren't a gymnast, what do you think you would do?I definitely would be a children's pediatric nurse or a NICU nurse. That would have been my dream.


What kind of legacy do you hope to leave behind beyond the medals and titles?Gymnastics will always be part of the conversation, because I've done it for so long and made huge strides in the sport. But I hope that when people look at me and talk about me, they think of the work I've done in the mental health space and within the foster care community. I was a foster child, so I know what these kids go through and what that looks like. Hopefully, my legacy includes the work I do for that community.

Elaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten lit up the ballroom on finale night of “Dancing with the Stars,” closing their season with elegance, storytelling, and a true performer's heart. They opened the evening with a rumba to “Take My Breath Away” by Jae Hall for the Judges' Choice Round — a routine that leaned into sensuality, fluidity, and emotional control. Elaine moved with stunning lines and deliberate intention, hitting every extension with the poise of someone who knows how to command an audience. Alan guided her across the floor with grounding presence and seamless partnering, helping their rumba land with sincerity and warmth. The judges praised her improvement, confidence, and ability to evolve as a dancer, awarding them strong finale-night scores.

They receive a perfect score for their first Rumba performance.

They will return for two more dances tonight. Elaine pulls the quickstep and song “You can't hurry love” by The Supremes. Hendrix and Bersten receive three nines for a total of 27.

For the Freestyle Round, Elaine and Alan transformed the stage with a dramatic, Broadway-inspired freestyle to “I Hope I Get It (from ‘A Chorus Line')” by District 78. Elaine embraced the theater-kid energy in full force — sharp kicks, ensemble-style choreography, and a sense of urgency that mirrored the emotion of the song. It was bold, competitive, and deeply personal. Alan built elements into the choreography that showcased her performer instincts: big staging, precise musicality, and storytelling that fit her natural artistic strengths. Their freestyle earned cheers and admiration from the judges, who applauded her commitment and her ability to deliver a character-driven performance in the most high-pressure moment of the season. Hendrix and Bersten receive another perfect score of 30 out of 30.

Before taking the stage one last time, Elaine Hendrix shared a heartfelt thank-you message to fans during an interview with WBIR. She spoke directly to viewers who had voted, commented, and cheered for her all season long. Elaine emphasized how meaningful the fan support had been during such an intense and transformative experience, saying that the encouragement carried her through long rehearsals and emotional challenges.

She expressed her gratitude with humility, noting that joining “Dancing with the Stars” pushed her far outside her comfort zone. The journey required vulnerability and resilience, and she credited the audience for helping her stay grounded and motivated. Elaine made it clear that every vote mattered, every message lifted her spirits, and every fan played a role in getting her to finale night. Her message reflected genuine appreciation — a reminder that, beyond the glitter and ballroom spectacle, she stayed connected to the people who believed in her every step.

Throughout her time on the show, fans frequently highlighted Elaine Hendrix's playful chemistry and public interactions with her longtime friend and “Parent Trap” co-star Lisa Ann Walter. After years of social media jokes, red-carpet banter, and supportive appearances, many fans began wondering whether the two were romantically involved. Elaine addressed that speculation directly in a recent Complex interview, clarifying that she and Lisa Ann Walter are not a couple.

Instead, she emphasized that their bond is rooted in deep friendship and creative partnership. The two have supported each other's careers for decades, but Elaine made it clear that the relationship remains platonic. She celebrated their connection as an example of strong female friendship — loving, loyal, and free from romantic expectation. The clarification didn't diminish fan enthusiasm; if anything, it highlighted how rare and meaningful long-term friendships can be in Hollywood.

The following contains spoilers for Supernatural #2, on sale now from Dynamite Entertainment

As I was just noting in a recent preview of Star Wars: Legacy of Vader #11, one of the cool aspects of licensed comic books is that you can flesh out details that occur between films, and show certain character developments in more depth. However, that is generally more of a film situation, since there is relatively little time spent in each film, while TV shows obviously spend a lot more time each season on the characters.

However, even with that extra time, there is still room for certain aspects of the show to be explored that don't get AS much attention, and one of the areas that Greg Pak has been looking in this new Supernatural series at Dynamite is to explore the practicalities of Sam and Dean Winchester being demon hunters. Namely, where do they get the money to fund their hunt?

 Supernatural #2 is from writer Greg Pak, artists Pasquale Qualano, Alessandro Rannadi, Vincenzo Federici, and Eder Messias, colorist Ellie Wright, and letterer Jeff Eckleberry, and it follows the "Between episodes" approach of this series (the entire series takes place between episodes towards the end of Season 1 of Supernatural) as the brother head to Las Vegas to try to win some money to help fund their hunt.

After Eder Messias did the full issue by himself, this issue is fascinating in that there are FOUR different artists involved in the issue. Now, that sort of thing tends to work really well when you have a story split into distinctive sections, but is often a bigger issue when you just have different artists come and go in the issue.

However, perhaps it is just a matter of their styles going together well or not, but for whatever reason, I really didn't mind the changes in the artists. I think they all did a good job on the storytelling, and more importantly, the character work of this issue, as this was very much a character-driven issue, and I really loved the message that we got in this issue in terms of character.

What really stood out to me was how the artists were able to get across so much character while actually sort of simplifying the style used on each of the characters. It is fascinating to see how much emotion you can wring out of a character with the simplest of lines. A furrowed brow here, a clench of teeth there, it's amazing just how much artists can get across in their work.

Ellie Wright debuts as a colorist on this issue (it might be a one-off, who knows), and she did a fantastic job, with the glitz of Las Vegas perfectly contrasted with the darker colors of the behind-the-scenes pages when the casino owners start to freak out about Sam and Dean's ghost-aided winning streak.

This issue takes place at a time when Sam Winchester is still a bit lost in his life. He has just gotten dragged back into the world of demon hunting, and he and his brother have also only recently learned that their mother's death was due to a demon (this series all takes place sometime after the 11th episode of season 1 of the show, which is when their father let them know about the demon being responsible for their mom's death). So he is flailing a bit, and that's why it is so cool to see instances like this issue where we can spotlight how cool of a guy Sam is.

The series always made a point of showing how compassionate Sam is of other people and their problems, and this issue is bassed on that concept, as well, but, like I said, it has more meaning when he is in the middle of such a strange time in his life. How many times have you snapped at someone because they happen to get in your way when you were going through a tough time? Sam's ability to rise above that is really impressive.

In this issue, the "monster of the week" is a ghost who is stuck at a casino in Las Vegas, where she hopes to get her revenge on the casino owner who played a part in her murder in 1961. She uses her ghost powers to help Sam and Dean start winning at gambling. She asks them to find her earring at a pawn shop.

They discover it, which is when they discover that she is a ghost. She had likely sent other people to the pawn shop over the years, but only Sam and Dean were able to get to the earring that her killer had pawned all those years ago. With the earring, she is able to make it so that EVERYONE in the casino has good luck.

However, the very nature of "Good luck" is often a misnomer, as good luck for one means bad luck for someone else, and Pak plays with that thought here, as Cassie gets her revenge, but it is done through some really good luck for other people, and some very BAD luck for the casino owner.

"Good" comes into play, too, when Cassie tries to cut a deal with the brothers, and, of course, Sam is not interested in using her powers to make a lot of money, but it is interesting that even Dean doesn't want to do anything on a grand scale. They just need what they need, and that's all that they need. It's a fascinating insight into the Winchesters at this point in their lives.

This has been a fun series so far, and I look forward to seeing what misadventures the brothers get into next, and I particularly enjoy seeing Pak expand the Supernatural universe with characters that we could theoretically revisit in future stories, both villains and heroes.

Conspiracy theories have spread online about Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the man identified as the suspect in the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, and his CIA ties.

Speculation has spread about Lakanwal, an Afghan national, after officials confirmed that he had once worked with the CIA, and social media users pointed to unusual Google Trends search activity. 

Newsweek has contacted the CIA  via the contact form on its website and Google via email on Thursday.

Many Afghan nationals, like Lakanwal, worked with U.S. forces, including the CIA, while assisting American operations during the war in Afghanistan. However, the revelation of his links to the agency combined with unexplained Google search activity has sparked widespread online speculation. 

While there is no evidence linking his previous work to the attack, the incident highlights how gaps in public understanding of national security partnerships and data patterns can fuel misinformation.

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that Lakanwal came to the U.S. on September 8, 2021 under the Biden administration's "Operation Allies Welcome program," which brought over Afghans who assisted U.S. forces following the fall of Kabul.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed to Fox News Digital that Lakanwal had worked with the U.S. government in Afghanistan, "including [with the] CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar," prior to the U.S. withdrawal from the country.

Following Lakanwal's links to the CIA being revealed, conspiracy theories spread on social media, particularly as some users pointed to unusual Google Trends activity that appeared to show his name being searched in the D.C. area prior to Wednesday's shooting.

X user Louis Montoya shared a screenshot of Google Trends which appeared to show a spike in Lakanwal's name being searched in D.C. in the hours before the shooting.

Another X user, James Li, noted a small amount of searches on November 20 in the D.C. area.

A search on Google Trends by Newsweek did not find the search activity shared by the posters on X, but did find a small volume of searches of Lakanwal's name in the D.C. area on October 30 and November 4.

Newsweek contacted Google for information about how search data is collected, and whether this could be an error or unrelated searches, for example of people with the same or similar names.

Some social media users have circulated unfounded claims suggesting that these unrelated details could imply CIA involvement in Wednesday's shooting.

X user Lara Logan wrote: "Is the CIA behind the murder of two US soldiers near the White House? Did they direct/orchestrate this act of war?"

Another X account The Patriot Voice wrote about Lakanwal's CIA links and the Google Trends data: "You NO longer have to guess if this is a FALSE FLAG operation, it is smacking us right in the face!!!"

Another X user Fabian Marta wrote: "His name spiked in DC searches hours before the shooting. Inside job."

CIA director John Ratcliffe told Fox News Digital: "In the wake of the disastrous Biden withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Biden administration justified bringing the alleged shooter to the United States in September 2021 due to his prior work with the U.S. government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar, which ended shortly following the chaotic evacuation." 

Lakanwal is in custody, and it remains to be seen whether more information about his past work with the CIA will be disclosed. So far, no officials have addressed the conspiracy theories circulating online.

Update, 27/11/25, 11.24 a.m. ET. This article has been updated with an image of the suspect.

The self-proclaimed "modern-day Nostradamus", Athos Salome, is back with more Royal family predictions - this time, he's zeroing in on Meghan Markle.

Athos, a 38-year-old psychic influencer known worldwide for allegedly predicting the Covid-19 pandemic, Queen Elizabeth's passing, and even Elon Musk's acquisition of X (formerly Twitter), gave an exclusive interview to the Daily Mail. He discussed the rocky professional road he believes Meghan is about to traverse.

The Duchess, who launched her With Love, Meghan Netflix series in March, and her lifestyle brand As Ever in 2024, has faced challenging public reactions.

Her show, which features recipes and decor discussions with celebrity guests, was met with criticism upon its release. Meanwhile, stock issues with As Ever led to order cancellations and disgruntled customers.

But according to Athos, Meghan's struggles are far from over. He claims to have "seen" a particularly tough remainder of the year for Meghan, including professional obstacles, public scrutiny, and bombshell revelations, reports the Express.

The psychic predicts a "growing conflict" between the Duchess and Netflix, leading to a permanent split between the two parties. He also mentioned in July that he foresees more "logistical setbacks" for As Ever, intense criticism, and a loss of credibility.

"Meghan's image will face its harshest trial by the end of 2025. [I] foresee explosive revelations from former staff or estranged allies. Criticism will reach a boiling point - and Meghan, in response, will retreat from the spotlight throughout 2026", he predicts.

However, according to Athos, this hiatus won't last too long. By the end of 2026, he anticipates Meghan will make a comeback, but with a renewed emphasis on social causes, particularly girls' education and mental health.

He suggests she will then transition into a new role as a hands-on producer, stepping away from the "lifestyle aesthetic".

He even goes so far as to predict that she'll return to the screen, albeit without any "no blockbusters, no red carpets". He adds: "Instead, an independent film, directed by a renowned female filmmaker - possibly European or Iranian - will mark her return to the camera".

"Her role? A woman who abandons a life of privilege to rediscover her essence. A metaphor? Absolutely. A confession? Quite possibly", Athos speculates.

He further suggests her performance will pleasantly surprise critics and put her on the radar for major film festivals in 2027.

This comes as the psychic claims the Royal Family should brace themselves for a "health issue" that will alter relationships but maintain some tension, such as the one between Harry and William, which he believes will only be resolved "in the next generation".
