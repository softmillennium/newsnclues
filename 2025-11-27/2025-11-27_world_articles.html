Following Wednesday's shooting of two National Guard troops in Washington, DC, President Donald Trump has responded with a pair of authoritarian measures: flooding the city with hundreds more guard members and pledging a crackdown against Afghan immigrants. A suspect is in custody after firing at the two guard members outside the White House, which left them in critical condition. The suspect — who was also shot and is now hospitalized — has been identified by law enforcement as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who relatives say served alongside US troops in Afghanistan during America's two-decade war. According to senior law enforcement agents, the shooting is being investigated as a potential act of terrorism. Within hours of the shooting, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that the Trump administration was deploying an additional 500 National Guard troops to DC, adding to the 2,200 that are already present as part of what Trump has claimed is a crackdown on surging crime. In comments to the Guardian, Gary Goodweather, a Democratic candidate in next year's mayoral election and a former US Army captain who served in the National Guard, said Trump's deployment of troops against US citizens made such a backlash inevitable. “No one should be harmed just for doing their job, and our thoughts are with them and their families,” he said of the two guard members. By sending more troops in, the administration risks inflaming tensions and undermining civil rights. As more information comes to light about this despicable tragedy, we urge against the administration putting more armed troops on our street corners.” That ruling barred the Trump administration from sending any more troops to DC. Thus far, no motive for the attack has been determined. “We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under [former President Joe] Biden,” Trump said in an address Wednesday night in which he called the shooting an “act of terror.” The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) then announced that “effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols.” While Noem said those admitted under the program were “unvetted,” this is untrue. As the audit shows, the program assigned several agencies to screen evacuees, check terror watch lists and criminal history, and attempt identity verification. It stated that in cases where it discovered evacuees on terror watch lists, “in each of these cases, we determined that the FBI notified the appropriate external agencies at the time of watch list identification and followed all required internal processes to mitigate any potential threat.” Speaking of the alleged DC shooter, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said: “We have no idea what this man's motive was at this point, and yet the Trump administration is already moving to paint every Afghan as a threat to this country. This comes as the country has dealt with dozens of mass shootings this year alone, carried out by people of varied origins.” As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

A new vision for the United States is being forced into place — one rooted not in liberty or justice, but in subjugation and the quiet normalization and acceptance of fascism. And you can see it in the current administration's campaign to control what young people learn about history, colonization, slavery, genocide, and the violent foundations of this country. This revival is not about remembering the past or indulging in a trendy, nostalgic aesthetic. It's a digital-age rebranding of Manifest Destiny — the idea that the United States was ordained to expand across the North American continent, seizing land, displacing and eradicating Indigenous people in the name of progress — now crafted to make subjugation look like patriotism and to turn historical distortion into accepted truth. Indeed the official social media account of the Department of Homeland Security posted the painting American Progress by John Gast on X — a scene that portrays westward expansion as a noble mission, with a floating white woman carrying “civilization” toward the frontier, while settlers, soldiers, trains, and telegraph lines push Indigenous people and buffalo into darkness and out of the frame — alongside the text, “A Heritage to be proud of, a Homeland worth Defending.” Examples like these are evidence of a larger project that uses nostalgia as a political weapon and mythmaking as a tool to justify violence. This narrative shapes policy, fuels immigration enforcement, and drives efforts to suppress education about Thanksgiving and the realities of colonization. It transforms federal agencies, social media, and public institutions into extensions of a worldview that treats Indigenous people as obstacles, the “Indian Problem” that the U.S. must still eradicate. Across campaign-aligned pages, far right networks, and the administration's own digital channels, westward expansion has been recast as an aspirational identity. The genocide, land theft, forced removals, and destruction of Indigenous nations that built the frontier are erased, and what remains is a cinematic mythology built for political use. The nostalgia is intentional because it shapes how people feel before they decide what to believe. Once that groundwork is laid, the defense of injustice and violent authoritarianism, like Hegseth's insistence that Wounded Knee soldiers “deserved” their medals or violent ICE raids at daycare centers and workplaces, no longer shocks. ICE has become one of the most powerful tools in this new frontier project, targeting Indigenous people under the guise of national restoration. They pointed to cases where Navajo citizens carrying state IDs and Certificates of Indian Blood were still detained or questioned by ICE, and where Tohono O'odham citizens were told that their ties to their own homelands did not matter because officials only recognized the border. In Iowa, a member of the Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community was nearly turned over to federal immigration agents after the Polk County Jail issued an ICE detainer meant for someone else. As Iowa Public Radio reported, police told the 24-year-old woman's family that she would be removed to a country she had never lived in. These cases reveal a pattern rather than isolated mistakes. The American Immigration Council recently warned that the Supreme Court's refusal to limit racial profiling in immigration enforcement has given officers even more room to target people based on appearance alone. This puts Indigenous people at particular risk, since tribal identification, Native languages, and even clear proof of citizenship are often ignored or treated as suspect by federal agents. The result is a system where Indigenous identity itself becomes grounds for questioning, detention, or removal, no matter how much documentation a person carries. The center points to the planned deportation of more than 600 Guatemalan children, at least 90 percent of whom are Maya, stressing that these children are Indigenous people with rights under both U.S. and international law. The same systems that once worked to erase Indigenous nations within the United States are now being used to remove Indigenous children and families from beyond its borders. It reflects the same thinking that once justified westward expansion. The ideology did not disappear; it simply learned to present itself in new ways. When that narrative takes root, it becomes easier to dismiss harm, ignore injustice, and discredit those who speak against it. This same narrative machinery is at work to shape how people in the U.S. understand Thanksgiving. For many households, the holiday is a time to gather with loved ones, share a meal, watch football, and express gratitude. Yet the holiday carries a heavier weight for our communities. It marks the beginning of a violent era of colonization set in motion when European settlers arrived on these lands. For generations, Thanksgiving has been offered as a simple tale of peace between settlers and Native peoples, a comforting story that reassures the country of its own goodness. This “friendly” version of Thanksgiving serves the broader strategies of historical revisionism used to justify settler colonialism by distorting, minimizing, or erasing the violence, exploitation, and resistance at the heart of this nation's formation. These myths reinforce settler identity and national pride, encouraging people to avoid uncomfortable truths and discouraging any critical engagement with our shared, complicated history. Even so, Native communities have never stopped pushing back against the sanitized Thanksgiving narrative. In Plymouth, the National Day of Mourning has gathered hundreds of participants each year since 1970 to confront the Thanksgiving myth at its origin point. On Alcatraz Island, the Indigenous Peoples Sunrise Gathering honors resistance, survival, and sovereignty. It is a struggle over who defines America and whose humanity matters. It is a struggle over who defines America and whose humanity matters. A country that denies genocide cannot claim justice. Insisting on telling the truth asserts that we are capable of more than myth and refuse to accept a future shaped by denial, distortion, and the quiet normalization of authoritarianism. Honesty is the path that lets us reconcile with our complicated histories, repair the harm that continues, and choose a different way forward. When we confront our history with honesty instead of lies, we create the possibility of a country where life, liberty, and justice are not privileges for the few but shared, inalienable rights for all. That is the measure of a nation brave enough to face itself. Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Africa, this year's G20 president, rallied all but two member nations — the US and Argentina — to issue a declaration, ignoring Washington's warnings and quelling questions about the G20's future — at least for now. Many doubted Pretoria would secure a declaration, much less tackle issues such as helping poor nations cope with climate change and external debt. That success strengthened a body which for years was struggling to reach meaningful agreements, and highlighted the power of multilateralism when it seemed in retreat, researchers and delegates said. US President Donald Trump would restore its “legitimacy” while hosting next year, it said. The White House had no immediate comment when asked if it planned to disinvite South Africa from next year's G20 events. The declaration's final paragraph was carefully worded to commit to meeting in future G20 summits in the UK and South Korea, but only to “working together” under the US presidency, a South African delegate said. That ceremony took place between equivalent diplomats this week. The summit had seemed hopelessly overshadowed by Trump's boycott over false allegations that South Africa's black majority government mistreats its white minority. “News of the G20's demise is greatly exaggerated,” said Josh Lipsky, the Atlantic Council's international economics chair and ex-aide to former US president Barack Obama. “In a crisis ... it will be there — regardless of which leaders are present at any ... summit,” he said. The declaration tackled issues such as climate and renewable energy that often divide G20 members. It proposed the first global panel to address inequality. Faced with Trump's ire, G20 leaders had a choice: “Do we butter him up or stand up to him?” Atlantic Council Eurasia Center nonresident senior fellow Michael Bociurkiw said. The US' actions brought together countries at odds with Trump, such as India and South Africa, with others seeking to maintain good relations, including the UK and France, another said. “The United States looks forward to emphasizing economic growth, deregulation and energy abundance as key pillars of its 2026 G20 host year,” a US Department of the Treasury spokesman said. At worst, countries could “lay low” during the US presidency then resume work later, said one delegate who also declined to be named. Despite the bitter differences, Washington's G20 agenda overlaps with Pretoria's in key areas such as development, economic growth and financial stability, UN adviser and Jubilee USA Network executive director Eric LeCompte said. There has been much catastrophizing in Taiwan recently about America becoming more unreliable as a bulwark against Chinese pressure. Some of this has been sparked by debates in Washington about whether the United States should defend Taiwan in event of conflict. There also were understandable anxieties about whether President Trump would sacrifice Taiwan's interests for a trade deal when he sat down with President Xi (習近平) in late October. On top of that, Taiwan's opposition political leaders have sought to score political points by attacking the Lai (賴清德) administration for mishandling relations with the United States. The diplomatic dispute between China and Japan over Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comments in the Japanese Diet continues to escalate. In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, China's UN Ambassador Fu Cong (傅聰) wrote that, “if Japan dares to attempt an armed intervention in the cross-Strait situation, it would be an act of aggression.” There was no indication that Fu was aware of the irony implicit in the complaint. Until this point, Beijing had limited its remonstrations to diplomatic summonses and weaponization of economic levers, such as banning Japanese seafood imports, discouraging Chinese from traveling to Japan or issuing Tokyo-Beijing relations have been rapidly deteriorating over the past two weeks as China tries to punish Japan over Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's remarks about Taiwan earlier this month, and the off-ramp to this conflict is yet to be seen. Takaichi saying that a “Taiwan contingency” could cause a “situation threatening Japan's survival” — which would allow Japan to act in self-defense — has drawn Beijing's ire and sparked retaliatory measures. Her remark did not gain public attention until Chinese Consul General in Osaka Xue Jian (薛劍) made an apparent threat to behead her.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This year's edition of Miss Universe, with its onstage injuries, dramatic walkouts and allegations of vote rigging, was already one for the ages. On Wednesday Mexican media revealed that Raúl Rocha Cantú, the Mexican businessman who owns half of the Miss Universe Organisation, was under investigation for drug, gun and fuel trafficking between Guatemala and Mexico. Rocha, whose conglomerate spans industry, casinos and the beauty pageant, has denied wrongdoing. When asked about the case by El País, he said: “It is completely false that I have an arrest warrant.” The attorney general's office later confirmed the existence of the investigation and said that arrest orders had been issued for 13 people, among them “Raúl R, about whom there have been various public reports”. Jakkaphong is accused of fraud by a plastic surgeon, who says she concealed information when persuading them to invest in her company, JKN Global Group. A verdict for the case was due on Tuesday, but Jakkaphong failed to appear in court – prompting the judge to order her arrest, deeming her a flight risk. At the start of November Bosch – then Miss Mexico – went viral when she staged a walkout after being berated as “dumb” by the pageant's director, who singled her out for failing to post promotional content. After a public outcry, the director gave a tearful apology and claimed he had been misunderstood, and the Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, described Bosch as an “example of how we women should speak out”. Bosch beat the crowd favourite, Miss Thailand, to win the crown – only for allegations of vote rigging to cast a shadow on her triumph. Mexican media have also reported on business ties between Rocha and Pemex, the Mexican state oil company where Bosch's father has worked for decades, prompting Rocha and Bosch's father to deny that there are any business ties between them personally. At a press conference on Wednesday, Sheinbaum again came to Bosch's defence.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• 65 dead, many missing: The confirmed toll from Hong Kong's deadliest fire in decades rose to at least 65 people, with many more still missing. Hong Kong's leader says fires are “basically under control” in the complex, home to a high percentage of elderly residents. Rescuers are still searching for the many missing residents. Three men who worked for a construction company have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter in relation to the fire. Black smoke is still billowing from the charred remains of several high-rise buildings in a Hong Kong apartment complex, more than 24 hours after the deadly blaze broke out. Many residents remain unaccounted for, and there are fears that the death toll could rise further. It is already Hong Kong's deadliest fire in seven decades. • Dozens dead: At least 65 people have been killed in the blaze at Wang Fuk Court, which a building expert said surged 32 stories in just five minutes. The death toll has remained unchanged for several hours. Yesterday, authorities said 279 people were unaccounted for, and we don't know how many are still missing. It is not clear how many people were able to evacuate. Although bamboo is celebrated for its flexibility and low cost, construction experts are once again questioning the use of this flammable material in building projects. Lee said the government will inspect all bamboo scaffolding in the city, and official bodies will meet to discuss a move to metal scaffolding. One man recalled hearing people screaming for help on Wednesday afternoon, before seeing smoke billowing outside his window. The affected residents will be attended to by 250 doctors and 250 other medical professionals. Hong Kong's Hospital Authority (HA) said around 50 of its staff members have been left homeless by the blaze at the Wang Fuk Court complex. “The HA will provide full assistance and appropriate support to affected staff members, including temporary accommodation arrangements and compassionate leave for those in need,” it said Thursday evening. One firefighter is among the dead, and 10 other firefighters have been injured. Hong Kong leader John Lee said the city is arranging a “one social worker per household” policy to ensure that Wang Fuk Court residents get the help they need. Survivors of the blaze who have taken shelter in schools and sports centers have told CNN how they escaped as flames engulfed their homes yesterday, many with only the clothes they were wearing. “There's no home to go back to,” said Wan, who spent the night at an emergency shelter with his wife, as volunteers and staff walked around distributing food and drinks. Another resident surnamed Yuen said he was most concerned about his parents – who are in their 70s and live in a separate apartment on the same floor as him and his wife. On Wednesday afternoon, Yuen rushed home from work when he heard the news, but wasn't allowed to enter the building, he said. Read more from survivors who spoke to CNN here. After a huge fire broke out in Hong Kong's Wang Fuk Court, debates about the safety of bamboo scaffolding resurfaced. After a huge fire broke out in Hong Kong's Wang Fuk Court, debates arose about the safety of bamboo scaffolding. The Hong Kong government will establish an assistance fund for the Wang Fuk Court housing estate, allocating 300 million Hong Kong dollars (about $38.5 million) in aid to affected residents, said city leader John Lee in an ongoing news conference. Speaking Thursday evening, he laid out several additional measures as the city mourns those killed and affected by the fire, including a memorial event. The government will cancel all celebratory events on the schedule, while government officials will avoid participating in “unnecessary” public events, Lee said. Lee also thanks Chinese leader Xi Jinping for his “concern” over the fire. “The development bureau is already meeting with the construction bureau to discuss that metal scaffolding will be used instead of bamboo scaffolding,” Lee said Thursday night. Read more about the debate around bamboo scaffolding in Hong Kong here. He added that 250 doctors and 250 other medical professionals will be set up in medical centers at these temporary shelters, and that the government is working to support bereaved family members. The fires across all seven buildings in Hong Kong's Wang Fuk Court are “basically under control,” the city's leader John Lee said at an ongoing news conference. Live video footage of the housing complex, which has been burning since Wednesday afternoon local time, still shows isolated pockets of fires burning through apartment windows. Firefighters will keep battling the blaze and searching for missing residents, he said. Hong Kong's leader John Lee is addressing reporters in his first televised remarks on the city's deadly blaze. Hong Kong's banking industry has been urged to help those affected by the fire at Wang Fuk Court to access funds, with HSBC announcing a raft of emergency measures to support the victims of the blaze and their families. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) asked banks to help those affected to access their funds, replace lost banking documents, offer repayment grace periods and waive penalties and service charges. They also called on banks to increase staffing at their branches in the Tai Po region. HSBC – Hong Kong's largest bank – said it is “deeply saddened” by the fire and has implemented emergency measures including hotlines and increased staffing to support residents of Wang Fuk Court. As smoke is still rising from the remains of the Wang Fuk Court and emergency workers try to find survivors, volunteers have been scrambling to rescue residents' pets. Videos on social media have shown cats, dogs and even a tortoise being rescued. “So far we have rescued around a dozen cats and seven to eight dogs. Some tortoises to,” Anson Cheng, a volunteer with Hong Kong Guardians, an animal welfare group, told Reuters Thursday. “From yesterday, we have around 20 volunteers here rescuing animals and people. There are also vets and veterinary nurses here helping too,” he added. “The time for people to evacuate from a 32-story building is essentially very slow,” said Xinyan Huang, associate professor at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University's Department of Building Environment and Energy Engineering. “This is not something that's considered in the building fire code.” Huang said bamboo is “definitely a flammable material” that is likely to ignite in Hong Kong's current dry season, with vertically oriented poles allowing fire to spread upward with ease. “And this is very similar to the other facade fire with flammable cladding. Once ignited, there is no time for firefighters to stop the fire spread.” He drew parallels to London's Grenfell fire, Britain's deadliest since WWII, which claimed 72 lives due to it being a 24-story residential building covered in flammable cladding. Mrs Dang said Wang Fuk Court was an ideal place to raise her growing family of four, after her husband won the public housing ballot that allowed them to buy a unit in the complex. But she remained living at the apartment, in Block 4. Dang, 68, who gave only her surname, said she returned from a dance class Wednesday afternoon to see Block 6 consumed in flames. “After a few hours, the other buildings started catching fire,” she told CNN from outside the CCC Fung Leung Kit Memorial Secondary School in Tai Po. “All I've done is watch my home burn to ashes,” she added. Wang Fuk Court was home to a larger population of elderly residents than in many Hong Kong housing estates. Roughly 36% of residents were 65 or older, according to Centaline Property Agency, which uses the city's government data. That's much higher than the percentage of elderly people in Hong Kong overall — 19.6%, according to Centaline. Officials are investigating “potential corruption” linked to renovations at Wang Fuk Court, the Hong Kong complex afflicted by a massive blaze. The Independent Commission Against Corruption, Hong Kong's statutory anti-graft body, announced on Thursday that it had set up a dedicated task force “given the significant public interest in this matter.” Parallel inquiries: The fire spread in an “unusual” manner, other officials said, and a criminal investigation has been launched, Security Secretary Chris Tang said. Hong Kong Police said they arrested three men – two directors and a consultant of a construction company – on suspicion of manslaughter, and accused them of “gross negligence.” Authorities will also investigate whether building materials complied with fire safety standards.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moscow generally agrees that the US' list of points on Ukraine could form a basis for future agreements, Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters. "In general, we agree that this could be the basis for future agreements," he said. "It would be impolite of me to talk about any final options now as there aren't any. But some things are fundamental," Putin added. The American side takes Russia's position, which was discussed before and after Anchorage, into account in some ways, he noted. "Somewhere we definitely need to sit down and seriously discuss some specific things," Putin said. "We need to put everything into diplomatic language because it's one thing to state in general terms that Russia does not plan to attack Europe. Frankly, that sounds ridiculous. We never had any intention of doing that. But if they want to hear it from us, well, okay, we'll state it for the record, no problem," he said.</p>

Editor's note: The story was updated with additional details. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Nov. 27 reiterated his demand that Ukrainian forces withdraw from their current positions as a condition for a ceasefire, even as the U.S. attempts to reinvigorate peace talks. "If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this through military force." Moscow has repeatedly rejected calls by Kyiv and its Western partners for a ceasefire, instead demanding that Ukraine cede the entire Donbas region. Russia illegally declared all of the partially occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts as its territory during sham referenda in September 2022. Putin stressed that the recognition of Russian rule over Crimea and Donbas — a demand Kyiv has ruled out — remains a key point in talks with the U.S. Putin claimed that after the Geneva negotiations, the plan was divided into four parts, but did not elaborate further. He also revealed that the Russian Foreign Ministry and Kremlin aides Yuri Ushakov and Vladimir Medinsky would oversee the negotiations. Commenting on the leaked call between Witkoff and Ushakov, Putin said such disclosures could amount to a criminal offense, while not ruling out that the intercepts might be fabricated. He added, "As I've already said publicly, we're ready for that." Ukraine's constitution prohibits holding elections under martial law, which was declared at the outbreak of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. Putin also ridiculed parts of the proposed peace plan and rejected claims that Russia is preparing to attack European countries — though he said he would be willing to formally put that assurance in writing. Tensions between European NATO members and Moscow have been surging in recent months, with allies accusing Russia of escalating hybrid operations and warning of an open conflict within the next five years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Diplomatic row worsens after US president says member state will not be invited to 2026 summit Therefore, at my direction, South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20, which will be hosted in the Great City of Miami, Florida next year. Trump had already said in February he was stopping aid to South Africa, accusing the government of discriminating against white minority Afrikaners, who ruled the country during apartheid and remain on average many times wealthier than black South Africans, including inciting violence against white farmers and confiscating their land. South Africa's government and many of its citizens have repeatedly pushed back against these claims, noting that land expropriation is only allowed under limited circumstances and that South Africa's high crime rate affects everyone in the country. A statement released by South Africa's presidency said Trump's comments were “regrettable”. It continued: “South Africa is a member of the G20 in its own name and right. South Africa is a sovereign constitutional democratic country and does not appreciate insults from another country about its membership and worth in participating in global platforms. “South Africa … will never insult or demean another country … It is regrettable that despite the efforts and numerous attempts by President Ramaphosa and his administration to reset the diplomatic relationship with the US, President Trump continues to apply punitive measures against South Africa based on misinformation and distortions about our country.” It hailed the summit as a success for multilateralism, with a leaders' communique that emphasised the importance of tackling issues including climate change and gender inequalities, all of which are anathema to Trump's administration. Meanwhile, Trump and US officials have continued to repeat the false claims about South Africa's treatment of Afrikaners. Land has been returned by courts to black owners displaced during the colonial and apartheid eras in just a handful of cases, after lengthy legal processes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. Ukraine and the U.K. have signed a license agreement to produce Octopus interceptor drones, Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on Nov. 27. Kyiv has rapidly developed its drone capabilities since 2022, evolving from modifying commercial aircraft to producing attack drones and reconnaissance systems on a large scale. The Octopus drone is one of several interceptor drones in development. "Mass production of interceptors is planned, which may reach several thousand per month," Shmyhal said, adding: "The manufactured means will be transferred to Ukraine to strengthen the protection of our skies." Shmyhal said on Sept. 18 that Kyiv will be able to deploy at least 1,000 interceptor drones daily to repel Russian attacks "in the near future," without specifying the time range.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A senior US official warned European diplomats in Kiev last week that Russia's ability to produce long-range weaponry is increasing, and that failing to rapidly resolve the Ukraine conflict would only raise the chances of escalation, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. According to the newspaper, US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said Russia's production capacity allows Moscow to not only continue striking Ukrainian targets with long-range weapons but also build up a surplus. Moscow has repeatedly warned against any escalation of the conflict. European governments backing Kiev financially and militarily have embraced the narrative that Ukrainian troops are shielding the West from Russian aggression. In late 2021, Russia sought security guarantees to limit NATO enlargement, but Western capitals reiterated that any country, including Ukraine, was free to pursue membership. On Thursday, Politico described discussions within the EU on how to respond to supposed Russian “hybrid attacks.” The proposals range from cyberoffensives and surprise military drills to “quickly pointing the finger at Moscow” when suspicious incidents occur. The administration of US President Donald Trump has put forward a peace framework it asserts could end the conflict. Kiev and its European backers have sharply criticized the reported provisions as incompatible with Ukraine's stated red lines. Russia has publicly distanced itself from the American proposal. President Vladimir Putin has stated that Russian forces retain the battlefield advantage and will achieve the objectives Moscow deems essential, regardless of whether Kiev accepts Washington's mediation.

The decision came after Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said the suspect was “an Afghan national who was one of the many unvetted, mass-paroled into the United States under Operation Allies Welcome on September 8, 2021, under the Biden administration.” Multiple media outlets reported earlier that the suspect, who allegedly critically injured two guardsmen in an ambush-style attack on Wednesday, is Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who entered the US in 2021 and was granted asylum earlier this year. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced on Wednesday evening that it has “stopped processing all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals indefinitely, pending further review of security and vetting protocols.” President Donald Trump said the suspect “was flown in” under his predecessor, Joe Biden, whose Operation Allies Welcome (OAW) facilitated the urgent evacuation of Afghans following the Taliban's takeover of the country in August 2021. “We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country,” Trump said. According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), around 90,000 Afghans entered the US under OAW and were allowed to remain in the country. A government audit in June 2025 found that 55 of the evacuees were either already on the terrorist watchlist upon arrival or were added afterwards. Trump described the chaotic exit as a “humiliation” and accused Biden of damaging America's reputation. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A reward poster for the arrest of Ryan Wedding at a news conference at the U.S. Justice Department announcing his indictment, charging him with murder and money laundering in connection to a drug trafficking organization. None of the allegations have been tested in court.Andrew Harnik/Getty Images The Toronto-area lawyer for alleged drug kingpin Ryan Wedding and a Vancouver man accused of laundering money for the former Olympic snowboarder appeared in court Wednesday as part of proceedings to extradite them to the U.S. Two other men who are among the eight Canadians charged last week in relation to the alleged international drug-trafficking ring also had scheduled court appearances on Wednesday. Efforts to extradite the accused are expected to be complicated by questions about whether U.S. prosecutors will seek the death penalty. Lawyer Deepak Paradkar, who faces multiple charges, including allegedly advising Mr. Wedding to kill a key witness who was set to testify against him, made a brief virtual court appearance in Ontario Superior Court in Toronto. Wearing an orange jail-issue shirt and with a grey beard, Mr. Paradkar was told his bail hearing is scheduled for Dec. 10. Mr. Hossain was ordered not to contact any of his co-accused and is to appear in court for his bail hearing next Thursday. They are scheduled to appear in court next month. Who are the Canadians facing charges connected to Ryan Wedding? They are among eight men arrested last week who face charges in relation to their alleged roles in a murder-for-hire conspiracy that Mr. None of the allegations have been tested in court. The extradition of these Canadians “would happen tomorrow if it were up to me,” RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme said last week. However, a recent court decision in the case of two Toronto-area men who also face extradition to the U.S. in connection to Mr. Wedding's alleged drug ring illustrates the often-prolonged nature of such proceedings. Gurpreet Singh, left, and Hardeep Ratte are two out of Wedding's 15 co-defendants.Supplied The ruling is a victory for the men, who are fighting prosecutors' efforts to put them on trial in Los Angeles. Extradition cases can drag on for years in Canadian courts and fights over disclosure of evidence further “stretch the proceedings out,” said Robert Currie, a law professor at Dalhousie University. A spokesperson for Justice Canada declined comment on specific cases, but said Canadian law broadly blocks extraditions of suspects if they might face the death penalty abroad. “Canada's extradition regime includes robust protections and safeguards,” said Ian McLeod. U.S. Attorney-General Pam Bondi said in February that Andrew Clark, a Canadian alleged to be Mr. Wedding's second-in-command who faces charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder and drug trafficking, could face “death or life imprisonment” if convicted. The U.S. case against many of the alleged Wedding operatives appears to rely heavily on evidence from a “co-operating witness” – a mole who helped police and conducted undercover operations targeting associates. The co-operating witness is believed to be Mr. Acebedo-Garcia, who was killed in Colombia on Jan. 31 after Mr. Wedding allegedly went on the hunt for an informant in his midst. The two men arrested last year, Mr. Ratte and his nephew, Mr. Singh, face charges of conspiracy to transport cocaine for a drug-trafficking organization. A timeline of Ryan Wedding's shift from Olympic snowboarder to alleged drug kingpin and FBI fugitive According to Justice Morgan's decision last week, the co-operating witness met with Mr. Ratte and Mr. Singh at an auto-body shop in Brampton, Ont., on Feb. 22, 2024, in an undercover operation managed by the RCMP. Justice Morgan ordered Canadian prosecutors to provide defence lawyers with copies of RCMP officers' notes and memos as well as audio and video recordings made by the co-operating witness in Canada. Justice Morgan also ordered Canadian prosecutors to reveal the co-operating witness's identity to defence lawyers unless there are concerns for the safety of any family members. Seven Canadians have been arrested for extradition to the United States in relation to a drug trafficking probe involving Ryan Wedding, a former Team Canada Olympian turned fugitive. Justice Morgan also ordered prosecutors to give Mr. Singh's lawyers Canadian police records related to his kidnapping in Mexico in August, 2024, and “all information” related to the incident exchanged between Canadian and foreign authorities. Mr. Singh's lawyers have alleged potential police abuse of process in relation to the kidnapping, saying investigators knew he was in danger but did not warn him. Justice Morgan did not make a finding about police conduct, saying more evidence is required. In addition, he said that U.S. and possibly Canadian authorities knew of Mr. Singh's plans to travel to Mexico and the reasons for his meeting. The prospect that an abuse of process has occurred is realistic enough to support the need for further investigation,” he wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A National Guard soldier secures the area with crime scene tape after a shooting in downtown Washington on Wednesday.DREW ANGERER/AFP/Getty Images Two national guardsmen are in critical condition and a wounded suspect is in custody after what officials said was a targeted shooting near the White House, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to order 500 more troops to Washington and promise to expand his crackdown on immigration. A man walked around a corner, raised a gun and opened fire around 2:15 p.m. Wednesday, according to local police, shooting two members of the West Virginia National Guard outside an entrance to the Farragut West metro station. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the suspect is an Afghan national who came to the U.S. as part of Operation Allies Welcome on Sept. 8, 2021. U.S. media, citing unnamed law-enforcement sources, identified the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, and said he had been living in Bellingham, Wash. In a video address from Palm Beach, Fla., where he is spending the Thanksgiving holiday, Mr. Trump said he would clamp down on Afghan refugees. “This attack underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation,” the President said, accusing former president Joe Biden of letting in “unknown and unvetted foreigners” from “places that you don't want to even know about.” Mr. Trump said the U.S. government would now “re-examine every single alien” who entered the U.S. from Afghanistan under Mr. Biden's administration. The wounded guardsmen were part of a wave of troop and federal police deployments by Mr. Trump across several U.S. cities, aimed at clamping down on crime, clearing homeless encampments and supporting efforts to round up undocumented immigrants for deportation. Mr. Trump and other top officials were away at the time. CNN, citing police sources, reported that the suspect received U.S. asylum this year, during Mr. Trump's presidency. A relative of Mr. Lakanwal's told NBC that he served in the Afghan army for 10 years, including in Kandahar, and helped U.S. special forces. West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey initially said the two guardsmen had died before correcting himself, saying that he was hearing conflicting reports. Police later said both guardsmen are still alive but in critical condition. One individual who appeared to target these guardsmen,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said at the scene. Other guards held the suspect down after the shooting until he could be arrested by police, Mr. Carroll said. He said it was not yet known what type of gun the suspect used. This is a matter of pride,” FBI director Kash Patel said. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said he had started the process of sending 500 more national guards to Washington on Mr. Trump's orders. There are currently 2,000 national guards deployed to the city. Mr. Trump sent the troops in August, along with officers from several federal agencies. He also temporarily took control of the Metropolitan Police. The crackdown has targeted undocumented immigrants, homeless encampments and street crime. It has entailed setting up checkpoints on busy streets and conducting spot patrols in bar districts. While police have taken the lead on most of these operations, guardsmen have at times been deployed to help them and also serve as sentinels at monuments and metro stations, and to clean up trash on the National Mall. Mr. Trump has previously taken action against Afghan refugees by ending a temporary protected status program this past summer as part of a broader push to strip some groups of immigrants of the legal ability to stay in the U.S. In his address on Wednesday, the President also directed unrelated criticism at Somali refugees in Minnesota, accusing them of “ripping off our country” and “ripping apart” the state. A federal judge last week ruled that sending the National Guard into Washington was illegal because Mr. Trump does not have the power to take such a step unilaterally. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb suspended her ruling from taking effect until Dec. 11 to give the government time to appeal. West Virginia deployed 300 National Guardsmen to Washington in August. While Washington saw a spike in homicides after the height of COVID-19 lockdowns, violent crime plummeted to a 30-year low in 2024. “I haven't seen this kind of thing. It's unnerving,” said Mr. Jones, who works in the area. Even before Mr. Trump's National Guard deployment, the area around the White House was heavily secured by several police agencies. In addition to the Secret Service and Metropolitan Police, U.S. Park Police are deployed at the nearby National Mall.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Argentina has officially proposed chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi as candidate for United Nations Secretary General. "The Republic of Argentina has the honor to propose Rafael Grossi, the IAEA Director General, as candidate for UN Secretary General in 2027-2031," the country's foreign ministry said. The IAEA chief has demonstrated "the ability of promoting political dialogue amid conflicts and serious international crises," which makes his a right candidate for UN secretary general, it said. Candidates to the post are nominated by member states, and each country can nominate only one contender. In turn, candidates are to present their vision of the organization's development, and declare their sources of income. If a candidate is working at a UN body, he is to suspend his duties for the period of election to avoid conflict of interest. The election itself is expected to take place in late July 2026. Rafael Grossi and Rebeca Grynspan, Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), have declared their intention to run for UN secretary general. The UN secretary-general is elected by the UN Security Council and approved by the General Assembly for a five-year term with a possibility of re-election. The number of terms is not limited, but the longest-serving secretaries served for ten years.</p>
