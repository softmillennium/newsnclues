                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been 15 years since the U.S. women's national team has faced off against the Italian women's national team, and a lot has changed since then. But on Nov. 28 and Dec. 1, the two sides will face off in two friendlies in Florida to end the year. Since their last meeting, the U.S. women's national team has won two World Cups and two Olympic gold medals, but Le Azzurre have not found the same success on the international stage. “The United States remain one of the most iconic teams in world football and for Italy the real victory is being on that stage, competing against the very best and showing that we belong in these environments,” says Alessandro Orlandi, an Italian FIFA agent and founder of Assist Women, the agency representing Italians Sofia Cantore and Lisa Boattin who have recently joined National Women's Soccer League teams. “For an Italian, seeing our players face the U.S. is already a milestone, a signal of how far the movement has come. Because once you step into arenas like this, there is no going back. With the recent hiring of manager Andrea Soncin, the Italians have started to rise to that level. In the intervening months, many players have begun to find playing opportunities abroad when previously, leaving Serie A Women was seen as a rarity. “This matters because football, especially in the women's game, grows through cross-pollination,” says Orlandi. “When Italian players move abroad, they are exposed to new training methods, different tactical cultures and higher levels of competition. These new journeys are aimed at not only growing their own games, but bringing new elements to Italy's game during a big growth moment for the team. Of the 28 players on the Italian roster this international break, four currently play outside of Italy—a number that continues to grow. “Many of them are driven by curiosity and the desire to test their limits in the most competitive environments. They want faster rhythms, more intensity, bigger stadiums and a stronger global spotlight. “We have been on a journey since the new head coach [Soncin] arrived, he believed and made us believe that we can compete against even the strongest teams,” said Boattin to Equalizer Soccer earlier this year after joining the Houston Dash. “Obviously we were disappointed with how the [semifinal game] against England went, but I must say it left us with this internal understanding that we have grown, worked hard, and have a strong ground. Overall, I especially hope that in Italy they can understand that there's a need to invest—we can't do everything on our own.” In Italy, women's sports have struggled to find the same foothold as men's, even with the sport of soccer being somewhat of a religion for the country whose men's team brought home the glory of a World Cup in 2006. “A few years ago the conversation was mostly about potential, now it is about performance, investment and long-term planning. Even so, the USWNT has demonstrated success against Italy, notching 11 wins, one draw and only four losses against Le Azzurre. There is also a bit of history between the two sides with Italy being the USWNT's first international match in history in 1985, resulting in a 1–0 win for the Italians. Italy's playing style has certainly evolved since that first matchup in 1985. Culturally, both the men's and women's side have been known for catenaccio, quite literally a door-bolt, locking things down defensively. The USWNT is used to playing teams who employ a low block, but Italy is not so one-dimensional. With the attacking duo of Girelli and Cantore, both of whom were 2025 Ballon d'Or Féminin nominees, plus dynamic midfielders like Roma's Manuela Giugliano, the USWNT will face a side hungry to prove itself on the international stage to end the year on a high. For Orlandi, seeing the players he represents succeed for both club and country is all part of growing the larger ecosystem around women's soccer in Italy. “Players who experience top environments abroad bring back a mentality shift,” Orlandi says. “They raise standards inside their clubs, influence younger teammates and expand the expectations around professionalism. Their success stories create a cultural wake behind them. It's a chain reaction that pushes everyone forward.” Jenna Tonelli is a writer for Sports Illustrated Soccer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liverpool boss Arne Slot has opened up on his future at Anfield after meeting with the club's owners. The Reds are currently on a dreadful run of form and were beaten yet again on Wednesday night in the Champions League by PSV. Liverpool's form has collapsed this season, culminating in the Champions League humiliation by PSV, a defeat which marked the club's worst run in over 70 years. The Reds' diabolical form includes being dumped out of the League Cup at home by Crystal Palace and consecutive 3-0 Premier League defeats by Nottingham Forest and Manchester City, followed by the humbling by the Dutch outfit. Fans and pundits alike are questioning the team's lack of fight and individual errors, and the failure of high-profile summer signing to integrate successfully into the team. But Slot has spoken with the Anfield hierarchy and fully believes his job is safe for now. Slot faced the press on Thursday ahead of Liverpool's next game against West Ham in the Premier League and was grilled on his future. And when pressed on what he can change to arrest the dreadful run of results, Slot added: "That's not so easy to say. It's normal to reflect on a game with decisions you have made. Keep fighting no matter how difficult it is I would be nice if we rewards ourselves in he moments we play well. People are focused on he parts we don't play well but there are large parts where we do play well." Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Anfield legend Jamie Carragher was caught on camera deep in conversation from the TV studio during the match, discussing Slot's decision to continue picking Ibrahima Konate, who was at fault for the third PSV goal. Carragher said: "Honest to god, I've had enough of them. That Konate, I mean, that's a sackable offence for the manager for f******g keep picking him. Slot had been urged to drop some of his misfiring stars amid Liverpool's run of form and was also asked if he would be making changes to his team for the game against the Hammers. He replied: "Everyone trains with us every single day, and they can prove themselves in that moment. Liverpool head south to West Ham on Sunday in a crucial Premier League match at the London Stadium as both teams are struggling with poor form and mounting injuries. But Slot's side have history on their side against the east Londoners, winning 86 of their 153 total meetings, and are heavily backed as favourites despite their current form. Slot has admitted it will be a difficult test: "It's a tough team to beat at the moment, West Ham. We definitely need to be ready for a challenge."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier this week, it was confirmed that countries qualifying through play-offs would go into pot 4, which means the Azzurri will theoretically have a quite tough group if they make it to the 2026 World Cup. Even pot 2 has some solid contenders, including 2018 finalists and 2022 semi-finalists Croatia. Erling Haaland's Norway already forced Italy to go through the qualifying play-offs by winning Group I and are in pot 3 alongside Mohamed Salah's Egypt and Scott McTominay's Scotland. Luckily, however, there can be a maximum of two European teams in each group (one from other confederations), so, for example, if Italy draw Spain from pot 1, they can't get Scotland from pot 3. So, what would be Italy's best- and worst-case scenarios look like if they qualify for the World Cup? Let's take a look, keeping in mind that the absolute worst outcome for the Azzurri would be failing to reach yet another World Cup altogether. Best-case scenario (based on FIFA Ranking): Canada, Australia, South Africa. Worst-case scenario (based on FIFA Ranking): Spain, Morocco, Panama Possibly, the worst-case scenario if Italy get a South American opponent from pot 1 will be: Argentina (or Brazil), Morocco, Norway (or Scotland). Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, IR Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia Pot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa Why are we talking about this before they even make it ? They have a long shot to make it and we discussing possible groups ?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeff Carlisle reports on the UCL performances of Timothy Weah, Weston McKennie and Malik Tillman. The just-concluded November international window witnessed a pair of impressive performances for Mauricio Pochettino's crew. With plenty of players sidelined by injuries, it opened the door for others such as the Vancouver Whitecaps' Sebastian Berhalter and Orlando City's Alex Freeman to restate their cases for inclusion on the World Cup roster. A four-month break until the next international get-together in March. In that time, just about anything can happen, with player fortunes rising and falling. At minimum, the players will get back to the hard slog of performing for their clubs, or in the case of those plying their trade in MLS, getting some time off to rest and recover from a long season. But momentum can be halted by a few injuries. So Pochettino and his staff will be traversing the globe -- OK, Europe mostly -- to see which players are on the rise and which are falling off. The break between international windows -- with a few games' worth of club performances since the November camp -- makes this the perfect time to roll out another edition of ESPN's USMNT Big Board, complete with a predicted 26-man squad, and which bubble players might still make a breakthrough. But his error that led to Uruguay's goal last week sows just enough doubt to conclude that his status is not iron-clad. But under Pochettino, there are no guarantees of anything. But then, come November, he was nowhere to be found, as Pochettino opted for players who either went deeper in the playoffs or were playing abroad. Given the Revs keeper's experience, that seems unlikely, but the U.S. manager is very much a "What have you done for me lately?" Turner needs to get out of the blocks quickly in 2026. - Carlisle: Win over Uruguay shows USMNT has come a long way in 16 months - O'Hanlon: Predicting the USMNT's starting lineup at the 2026 World Cup - Hernandez: How Roldan went from afterthought to Pochettino favorite Schulte is the pick here for no other reason than he has been around. It's easy to forget that had he not sustained an injury in June, it might have been him starting in the Gold Cup and not Freese. Richards' absence from the November window means little, as he remains a locked-in starter when healthy. Ream turned 38 last month, yet he remains a vital players on the U.S. backline, with his positioning, passing and leadership remaining at a high level. Pochettino's recent tactical approach of defending with four and building out of the back with three still plays to Ream's strengths, although he's shielded a bit more when wingbacks are part of the equation. No one has yet come close to pushing him out. He'll get a much-deserved rest now that Charlotte's MLS season is over. McKenzie is also getting steady playing time at Toulouse, which should go far in terms of keeping him in good standing with Pochettino. Robinson's spot on the roster looked to be vulnerable for a spell, especially when injury ruled him out of the September window. He even played for a spell at right back against Australia, and that kind of versatility helps when it comes down to roster decisions. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Because of an Achilles injury to Cameron Carter-Vickers, Trusty has taken advantage of opportunities at both the club and international level. His spot is vulnerable with Tristan Blackmon returning to health, but Trusty will be playing during the December/January period, while Blackmon won't, giving him a chance to put some distance between himself and his competition. He was the latter against both Paraguay and Uruguay, although against La Celeste, he was a bit more inverted. The positional switch does play to Dest's strengths more, as it shields him from defensive responsibilities that aren't his forte. His status at PSV remains secure, even after he arrived late for a UEFA Champions League match. Where he plays for the U.S. in 2026 remains an intriguing question. Left back is a bit thin at the moment, and that could be an option. When he was left off the roster in October, his spot seemed under threat, but he showed off his ability to play multiple positions along the back for both club and country -- he could even play as a right-sided center back if necessary -- and that has been enough to get him back in the 26. It has been quite a 2025 for Freeman, who broke into the Orlando City lineup, made his national team debut in June, and finished on a high, scoring twice against Uruguay. Pochettino has been an admirer throughout Freeman's ascension up the international ranks, and the performance against La Celeste has created some separation between Freeman and his competition. At this point, Arfsten is the only out-and-out left back on the roster, although Dest and Timothy Weah are plenty capable of lining up there. Adams was another player to miss out on the November window, in his case because of a head injury, but he continues to play at a high level for Bournemouth, where his range and tackling are vital. On the surface, McKennie appears to be doing everything right. His goal in the Champions League against Bodo/Glimt is just one example. That Pochettino opted to leave McKennie at home for November so he could prove himself to new manager Luciano Spalletti makes some sense, but it also leaves one to wonder just how secure McKennie's spot is. Where he plays with the U.S. is an open question as well. There remain midfielders in the pool with more international experience than Roldan (thinking Johnny Cardoso and Yunus Musah here), but Roldan has proved himself to Pochettino, and even if everyone is healthy, it won't be a surprise to see the Seattle midfielder called up in March. Pochettino appreciates the grind, and as long as Morris continues to compete on that front, he should keep his spot with the USMNT. His performance against Paraguay saw his influence increase as the game progressed, and he even chipped in with a goal as a substitute against Uruguay. Tessmann's recent performances for Lyon have drawn less-than-stellar reviews, but he seems back in Pochettino's good graces, and steady playing time with his club should see him remain in the U.S. fold come March. Yet Pulisic has regained his sharpness quickly and delivered in a critical moment, scoring the only goal in Milan's 1-0 win over city rival Inter Milan. As much as Pochettino says no one is guaranteed a spot, Pulisic figures to be the exception to the rule, that is, if he remains healthy and keeps delivering for his club. Weah continues to gain steady playing time for Marseille, with his ability to play multiple positions an asset in that regard. It remains to be seen where Weah will line up for the U.S., although don't be surprised if a wingback role is where he ultimately lands, especially if that area of the field continues to be affected by injuries. That ability to finish plays had been missing from some of his other performances of late, so that goal will help his chances. His ability to make the final roster might be dependent on how many strikers Pochettino ends up taking. If the manager goes with three, Luna is likely to make it. If Pochettino opts for four, Luna might be the odd man out. Zendejas' September boost from a man-of-the-match performance against Japan gave way to some injuries in October and November, allowing other players to step forward. Zendejas is probably still ahead of Luna in the pecking order, given what is asked of him at Club América, but he'll need to make the most of Liga MX playing through the winter months to cement his spot. The upcoming months, even with the Bundesliga's winter break, will be a time for Reyna to solidify his standing for his club. If that happens, a similar rise at international level will follow. The U.S. attack also looks more fluid when Balogun is on the field because of his ability to get behind defenses and link up with teammates. If there was one player who took a step back during the November window, it was Pepi, who squandered a glorious late chance against Paraguay, and overall played less than either Balogun or Haji Wright. That would appear to leave an opening for any member of the chasing pack behind him. There also seems to be no dislodging of Guus Til from the starting lineup at PSV. There's still time, of course, but Pepi is another player needing to make the most of the winter months ahead. Wright wasn't at his best for the U.S. in November, but his two-goal performance against Australia was recent enough to give him a solid grip on a roster spot. His once-torrid scoring pace at the club level has eased a bit as well, so he'll need to continue to deliver as Coventry push for automatic promotion. Celentano's overall season was much more impressive than that, and he's still in the running for a spot, but for him to make it, he'll need to have the form of some of his competitors fall off. Now he faces an uphill climb to get back on Pochettino's radar and make a case for inclusion. A knee injury meant that he missed much of Vancouver's playoff run, and now a red card against LAFC means he'll miss the Western Conference final. His capable performance against Japan in September seems like a long time ago, and he now faces a tough slog to get back into Pochettino's rotation. Banks continues to get minutes in the Bundesliga for Augsburg, having appeared in the club's past seven league games; heady stuff for an 18-year-old. He has terrific size and is calm on the ball, but sometimes loses concentration, which can lead to critical mistakes. But he has shown growth and was called in for the September window. Still, it seems like a cycle too early for Banks to have an impact at the international level. It's a tough blow for Carter-Vickers, and one that probably will result in him missing out on a second consecutive World Cup. Robinson's placement in the "bubble" category has nothing to do with ability. But Robinson's continued struggles with a knee injury that required surgery last May is alarming. Pochettino waits for no one, but hopefully a March return is in the works, at which point we can see how far away from top form Robinson is. Tolkin has shown well on those occasions when he has played, and showed he could take plenty of abuse against Uruguay. With other players such as Arfsten continuing to impress Pochettino, it will take some doing to even get back on the U.S. manager's radar. It's a welcome development given that it was Cardoso's first appearance since Aug. 30, but the reality at international level is that other U.S. players have leaped over him on the USMNT depth chart. Wednesday was a start, but it will take more than just one UCL performance to change Cardoso's fortunes. A change in manager from Ivan Juric to Raffaele Palladino has resulted in U.S. international mostly riding the bench, although he did see the field as a substitute in his side's 3-0 Champions League win over Eintracht Frankfurt. In fact, Musah has logged more minutes in league play this season with previous club AC Milan (90) than he has with Atalanta (55). Unless that changes, there doesn't appear to be a way into the USMNT for Musah. De la Torre is another player who has slid down the depth chart. Although he received plenty of playing time with San Diego for much of the season, by season's end, he had been used as a sub and hadn't started a game in two months. Meanwhile, the likes of Berhalter and Roldan have moved past him. To be clear, Berhalter has made the most of his opportunities, none more so than in the aforementioned demolition of Uruguay, when he scored a goal and assisted on another. But if players such as Adams and McKennie return to the fold -- which seems likely -- it looks as if Berhalter will be on the outside looking in. Mauricio Pochettino talks about his USMNT squad ahead of their clash vs. Paraguay. Aaronson's World Cup hopes seemed to be at a low ebb, considering he barely played in the Gold Cup, as well as the October window. There is still a passel of players that he needs to climb over, but he's back in Pochettino's thoughts with plenty of potential games with Leeds United to make his case. The question is: Will Pochettino take that extra forward? His recent rosters would suggest not, but it's still possible. None of this is a recipe for getting an international call-up. Given Agyemang's relative success with Derby, it will take a special confluence of circumstances -- injuries -- to get him back in Pochettino's reckoning.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If not listed, please contact your TV provider. A year of intentional rotation and experimentation under the guidance of head coach Emma Hayes will get one more camp before reaching its conclusion, and there are still two more games to evaluate. The Stars and Stripes have a 10-3-0 record heading into their two-game series against Italy. Their three losses came against Brazil, Portugal, and Japan, and the USWNT will try to avoid any additional losses as the program hasn't lost more than three games in a year since 2001. It's been almost 15 years since the U.S. and Italy faced each other, and while the USWNT have a winning record against the Italians (11-1-4), this is a European side still surging from their 2025 UEFA Euro semifinals appearance. Date: Friday, Nov. 28 | Time: 7 p.m. ETLocation: Inter & Co Stadium -- Orlando, Fla.TV: TNT The USWNT capped off the fall season with a three-match window in October that included a shocking loss to Portugal, an immediate rematch for revenge, and a thrashing of New Zealand that reminded everyone about the squad's ability. With so many players in and out of the talent pool, Hayes has earned her wish of wanting the hard coaching decisions. Ahead of the Italy matches, Hayes named a 26-player roster. The group is a solid mix of veterans, with the return of some familiar faces, and promising young talents. Chelsea FC defender Naomi Girma returns to the roster after a lengthy absence due to a lingering calf injury. Rose Lavelle is also among the veteran core of players but returns to camps fresh off winning the 2025 NWSL Championship. She is one of seven players who participated in the league's biggest game of the year, alongside Gotham FC teammates Lilly Reale, Emily Sonnett, Jaedyn Shaw, and Jaelin Howell. Kate Wiesner and Croix Bethune represent Washington Spirit as runners-up. Hayes is still following the trend that she set with more first-time call-ups and players who are on the brink of debuts. Bay FC goalkeeper Jordan Silkowitz earned a call-up after an eyes ocket fracture to Phallon Tullis-Joyce kept the Manchester United starter unavailable for selection. Chicago Stars FC forward Jameese Joseph earned her first senior team call-up after making U-23 rosters nearly all year. Defensive midfielder Howell marks her USWNT return for the first time since October 2022. She had a career season with Gotham FC and capped it off with a shiny new NWSL Championship trophy. Howell joined the NWSL in 2022 from Florida State University after being drafted No. 2 overall (behind Girma) as a two-time Mac Hermann Trophy winner, with some early comparisons to Julie Ertz as a more bruising type midfielder. She made her senior team debut in 2020 and spent some time in camps till 2022, though during her early years as a pro, she had to manage a string of injuries that kept her on the sidelines for both club and country. Now, her fourth year in NWSL, she's put together a standout season where she led the club in recoveries (172), tackles (84), and interceptions (51). Howell has finally combined the right club with a healthy season for success. "I always knew she was a phenomenal player, but watching [Rose] work in the middle and having her help me, what I learned from her, just watching her in practice or on the field, and what she teaches me, when she's talking to me. has just been a huge game changer for my career," Howell told CBS Sports. I try to tell them all the time how much it's meant to me, but I'll continue to say it just because I think that they're not only great players, but great teammates, who try to help everybody around them. Obviously, playing in between them has been huge for me this year." The Italians are currently ranked 12th by FIFA, and their inspirational run to the UEFA Women's Euro semifinals wasn't a success that happened overnight. Though they're ascending at the moment, games against the USWNT will be a challenge for their program as well, and head coach Andrea Soncin will want to test his defense against the dynamic attacking USWNT.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Getting Cristiano Ronaldo off is a genuine disgrace – but Gianni Infantino has plenty of form for being an awful, narcissistic dick. Infantino is approaching a decade as FIFA president, in which time he has shown himself to be a shameless, power-hungry sycophant. We've picked out seven times he showed his true colours. There are many more, but the internet is only so big. Let's start with the most recent act of bastardry… Infantino would doubtless claim he had nothing to do with Ronaldo being reprieved to allow him to feature in Portugal's first two matches at the World Cup finals. But his slimy tentacles will extend to the FIFA disciplinary committee which, almost without precedent – certainly a relevant one – suspended two-thirds of the Portugal superstar's suspension for violent conduct. Let's not forget, his elbow into Dara O'Shea's ribs and the subsequent cry-arsing as he left the stage in Dublin was completely blatant. It gave FIFA and Infantino a problem, because we couldn't possibly have a World Cup without Ronaldo front and centre at every available opportunity, could we? How did they wriggle out of it? By blowing the dust off Article 27 of their disciplinary code, allowing them to suspend most of Ronaldo's ban while him and Infantino indulged in a spot of mutual back-scratching. A one-game suspension saw Ronaldo miss the final qualifier against Armenia – Portugal coped by winning 9-1, offering further evidence that they might be a more fluid side without the 40-year-old – freeing him up instead to escort Infantino to perhaps the worst dinner party imaginable in the White House, with Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and a cast of other truly dreadful people. It was bad enough when, in August, Infantino took the World Cup trophy to the White House and, talking in a tone usually reserved for spoilt children or despotic autocrats, passed it to the US president. “Only the FIFA president, presidents of countries, and then those who win can touch it, because it's for winners only. “Can I keep it?” replied Trump, almost certainly not joking. As face-cavingly cringeworthy as that exchange was, Infantino took the toadying to a whole new level last month. While his new BFF was bitching about not winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Infantino again took the approach he might with an overindulged toddler. He grabbed the shiniest object to hand and presented it to Trump as the first ever, made-up-on-the-spot FIFA Peace Prize. “In an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it's fundamental to recognise the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace,” Infantino said. “Football stands for peace, and on behalf of the entire global football community, this prize will recognise the enormous efforts of those individuals who unite people, bringing hope for future generations.” Thank Christ Infantino wasn't around in 1936. Infantino has shown he is happy to expand his tournaments and bend their rules to make sure his bezzie mates don't miss out. But even when those nefarious methods don't work, he'll bring them anyway. “Congratulations on your wonderful 2024 Supporters' Shield success!” Infantino exclaimed to Inter Miami at the end of the MLS 2024 regular season. Seattle Sounders were already representing the home nation on merit. But Lionel Messi doesn't play for the Galaxy. And like Ronaldo at the World Cup, regardless of merit, Messi simply had to be a headliner at Infantino Fest 2025. If it's not convenient to watch the video, or you don't trust yourself not to destroy your device once you have, let us relay his opening remarks, after which most of those present were too busy choking on their own vomit to listen on. I feel like them because I know what it feels like to be discriminated, to be bullied as a foreigner in a country. Yeah, imagine… imagine the level of c*ntiness necessary to compare his experiences as a wee ginger to those of the properly persecuted. From there, he went on to accuse critics of Qatar's human rights record of hypocrisy and the media of racism for, among other things, exposing that some ‘fans' were paid props on the set of the most gratuitous sportswashing project to date. MORE: F365 in The Room Next Door to Infantino for that clusterf*** of a press conference “This topic is not about whether we want a World Cup every two years, but about what do we want to do for the future of football. If we think about rest of world and the vast majority of Europe, then we have to think about what football brings. We cannot say to the rest of world give us your money, but watch us on TV. Infantino has made a habit of sticking his pristine-white size 9s right in it when it comes to what many with a smidgen of self-awareness might consider a thorny issue around Africans and death… For in 2023, before a deferent crowd in Kigali while sweeping unelected to a third term as president – no wonder Trump relates – Infantino took the acclaim before likening his rise to the top of FIFA with Rwanda's recovery from genocide. Infantino said his personal mission to drive the FIFA gravy train was inspired by a visit to the African country's memorial to the horrors of summer 1994 when 800,000 people were slaughtered in 100 days. “What this country has suffered and how this country came back up is inspiring for the entire world. So, I certainly couldn't give up because someone was telling me something. Truly, this pr*ck's narcissism knows no bounds. Remember when Infantino formed half of 2022's hottest power couple – him and that steak shagger? With racism in football refusing to f*** all the way off, we want to hear your views and your experiences on one of the thorniest issues in the game… It seems Jurgen Klopp has already given Liverpool two names to replace Arne Slot and one of them is Steven Gerrard. Are Liverpool about to sack Arne Slot? They actually really might be after that absolute sh*t-show against PSV. Liverpool fans are split about whether Arne Slot should still be the manager, but they are united in thinking change must come.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stay on current site or go to US version. Estêvão, with four brief substitute appearances under his belt, was a promise and a possibility for Brazil's 2026 World Cup squad. The one-time boy prince was returning to Santos, where the story started, and his old club was going to give him a platform to round off the narrative with one final attempt at World Cup glory. Fast forward 10 months, and things have turned out very differently. Estêvão is going from strength to strength and was given his first Brazil start in Carlo Ancelotti's debut match in charge. He is making an extreme case to be an integral part of the World Cup team, helping himself to five goals between September and November. - Source: Neymar wants to play on despite pain - Estêvão has Chelsea looking deserving 'world champions' tag - Can Vinícius Júnior find a spark to his season by playing for Brazil? With Santos in the relegation zone, that is bad news for him and bad news for the club. The expectations were probably always too high for a couple of reasons. First, there is the extraordinary, nigh on miraculous, history of Santos. Excellent youth development brought back the glory years in the 21st century, and lightning appeared to have struck twice when a baby-faced Neymar emerged and led them to the Copa Libertadores in 2011. As financial gaps have opened up, it has become harder for Santos to compete. They bounced straight back, and the hope was that the return of Neymar would add plenty more positive momentum. Some saw them as possible title contenders, but they were aiming too high. This is especially true since Neymar was still trying to shake off the effects of a serious knee injury he suffered while playing for Brazil in October 2023. He simply was not fit enough, said the coach. At the beginning of 2025, Neymar was an unknown quantity as a footballer. Judging him as a player still seems harsh; he has never been able to put together a sequence of games that would enable him to get up to full match fitness. He was then out for another six weeks before returning early this month, but then, worryingly, given the original problem, he went down with a knee injury that threatens to end his season. Watch your favorite events in the newly upgraded ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. In those 17 rounds (of 35 played so far) in which he has been on the field, how has he done? But the standout feature of peak Neymar was his skill as a dribbler, his talent to change direction and improvise solutions at top pace. And without this, it has not been easy for Santos' coaches to find a way to make him useful. A low point was the 6-0 defeat to Vasco da Gama in August. The lesson -- and it cost coach Cleber Xavier his job -- was that it was not feasible to play Neymar, a center forward and two wingers. With no balance between attack and defence, Vasco carved Santos to pieces. The solution found by the new boss, Juan Pablo Vojvoda, has been to use Neymar as a free-roaming center forward, left upfield to avoid defensive responsibilities, and also able to drop and organize the play from deep. But for Brazil's all-time top scorer, three league goals is a disappointing return and very frustrating. This has been a keynote of Neymar's return, the sense of frustration that frequently comes close to boiling over. It might have been hoped that the time away from the pitch would have focused his mind on ways that he needed to change to reach his immense potential. He threw a mini-fit when he was substituted -- and it came across as poetic justice -- when, in his absence, Santos pulled two goals back. This was extremely disappointing from a player who, whatever the public perception, has usually been very popular in the various dressing rooms he has been a part of. But now, if he really is ruled out of the last three games of the season, he needs his teammates to come to his rescue. It is far from clear that the club could afford to keep Neymar, as there are already grumblings about his cost and benefit. But there is surely no way that he could play his way back into the Brazil squad from the second division. He would presumably be forced to hurriedly fix himself up with another club.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arsenal, six points clear at the top, heads to Stamford Bridge on a wave of optimism and a growing belief it will end its long wait for a first league title since 2004. After three straight years as runner up, it feels like Arsenal's time has come and Wednesday's demolition of European powerhouse Bayern Munich was further evidence of its credentials to win the biggest prizes, not only the title but perhaps the Champions League as well. With defending champion Liverpool in freefall and Manchester City also off the pace, it could be Arsenal's title to lose. The closest challenger is second-place Chelsea, winner of the Club World Cup in July and with a squad that cost more than $1 billion. Coach Enzo Maresca is only in his second season in the Premier League and has a squad packed with inexperience, but Chelsea produced its standout performance of the campaign to beat Barcelona 3-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday. City can temporarily move up to second with a win against Leeds while Liverpool, on the back of six losses in seven in the league, is at West Ham. Brazil forward Estevao has quickly established himself at Chelsea and has been one of the most exciting players this season, with nine goals in his last 13 games for club and country. Hugo Ekitike was substituted in Liverpool's game against PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday because of a back complaint. Matheus Cunha missed Manchester United's defeat against Everton because of what was described as a knock in training. Benjamin Sesko is out with a knee injury. Liverpool's title defense is at crisis point, with growing scrutiny on coach Arne Slot after a run of nine defeats in 12 games in all competitions. Slot said he was still “feeling safe” after the latest loss, but it is clear he needs to turn Liverpool's form around after its damaging run. The pressure could mount further if Liverpool slips up again at an upwardly mobile West Ham.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Neymar has been spotted in Santos training despite reportedly being told by club doctors that he risks worsening his injury. The former Barcelona star has had an injury-hit season, with the veteran only recently returning to action from a hamstring problem. This week, it emerged that Neymar had been struggling with knee discomfort, ruling him out of their 1-1 draw with Internacional on Monday. They currently sit one place above the relegation zone (17th) in the Brasileiro Serie A with three matches remaining. Shortly after picking up that valuable point, Santos manager Juan Pablo Vojvoda revealed what the club have planned for their "leader". Before the Mirassol game, he felt discomfort in his knee. The following day he was experiencing significant discomfort in that knee. With travel, we'll arrive in Santos tomorrow afternoon… He's a player we need for all three rounds and he'll help us. Footage from Santos has shown that Neymar trained with his team-mates on Wednesday but it is clear he is not at 100 per cent. This injury is said to be causing Neymar 'persistent pain' when exercising but he is considering playing 'in the sacrifice' of Santos. The report adds that Neymar's knee 'can burst at any major impact' and the doctors are advising that he stop playing/training and undergo an arthroscopy. However, that would end his season, with the Brazilian likely to be out for a month as a result. Incidentally, when Neymar took part in team training, he avoided contact, and he played with support on his left knee. The fear is that if he doesn't rest his knee, this issue could become a lot worse, potentially ruling him out for the start of 2026 and jeopardising his chances of a Brazil national team call-up in March. Despite that, Neymar is reportedly mulling over what to do, as a potential return to the second division beckons. The former Paris Saint-Germain star, who joined Santos at the start of 2025 after having his Al-Hilal contract cancelled, has had a mixed second spell at his boyhood club so far. The ex-Barca ace has been on the sidelines for lengthy periods and a return of seven goals and three assists in 25 matches in all competitions is nothing special. While Santos are keen to keep him, that will only likely be possible if they stay in the Brazilian top-flight. Next up, they host Sport Recife on Friday, who are rock bottom of the division. This is, arguably, a must-win game for Santos, particularly as Fortaleza have won two matches in a row and are just one point behind the Brazilian giants.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 cadet championship is poised to crown a new winner, and Flashscore takes a closer look at how European teams have performed in past finals. A second-half brace from Johannes Moser fired Austria past Italy, while reigning European champions Portugal edged four-time world champions Brazil on penalties to book their place in the showpiece. Beyond the fireworks expected in Qatar's football cathedral, what makes this final truly special is that the tournament is set to crown a brand-new champion. As anticipation grows for what promises to be a thrilling contest, this piece takes a closer look at Europe's long and varied history in U17 World Cup finals. West Germany, led by the prolific Marcel Witeczek, who had scored back-to-back hat-tricks in the quarter-final and semi-final, advanced to face a relatively unknown Nigerian side that had edged Guinea in the last four. In Canada, Europe won their first U17 World Cup title when the Soviet Union defeated defending champions Nigeria at the University of Toronto's Varsity Stadium. The match was a repeat of their group-stage meeting, which ended 1–1, but this time Aleksandr Piskaryov's team came out on top. Yuriy Nikiforov put the Soviets ahead in the sixth minute, but Nigeria hit back five minutes later with a fine goal from Philip Osondu. Europe's hopes of claiming the U17 World Cup were dashed as Spain fell to Ghana in the final held in Florence. Both teams had entered the decider unbeaten, having previously played out a 1-1 draw in the group stage, with Pepe Galvez cancelling Nana Opoku's opener. Emmanuel Duah's decisive 77th-minute strike proved the difference, securing Black Starlets' victory and leaving Spain's dream of U17 glory unfulfilled. After a 12-year absence from the U17 World Cup final, Europe returned in style as France claimed the title, overwhelming Musa Abdullahi's Nigeria at Hasely Crawford Stadium in Port of Spain. The final was a rematch of their group stage encounter, where the Golden Eaglets had edged Les Bleus 2-1, with Florent Sinama Pongolle's goal unable to overturn strikes from Karimu Shuaibu and Victor Brown. This time, French team dominated, with Sinama Pongolle, Anthony Le Tallec, and Samuel Pietre all finding the net to secure Europe's second U17 World Cup triumph. Spain came close to claiming the tournament in Finland, but a decisive goal from Leonardo gave Brazil a 1-0 victory in Helsinki. The only goal arrived just seven minutes in when Brazilian captain Joao curled a 20-metre free-kick against the post, leaving Leonardo to tap in from close range. Spain created several promising chances but were repeatedly denied by goalkeeper Bruno, who was in superb form. It was another heartbreak for Europe as Spain fell to Nigeria in the final. After a thrilling 0-0 stalemate through extra time, the title was decided on penalties, where Nigeria triumphed 3-0 at the Seoul World Cup Stadium. Goalkeeper Oladele Ajiboye emerged as the hero, saving two crucial spot-kicks and securing the Golden Eaglets' third U-17 crown, following their wins in China (1985) and Japan (1993). Debutants Switzerland stunned hosts Nigeria with a 1-0 victory to claim the world title in Abuja. Haris Seferovic's 63rd-minute header proved decisive, securing the Europeans' first-ever World Cup title at any level. The English team responded before half-time with Rhian Brewster scoring, followed by Morgan Gibbs-White's equaliser. Phil Foden then scored twice around a Marc Guehi strike to seal the victory and ensured Europe claimed a fourth triumph. Paris Brunner and Noah Darvich had given Germany a two-goal lead, but the French fought back through Saimon Bouabre and an 85th-minute equaliser from Mathis Amougou. During kicks from the penalty mark, goalkeeper Konstantin Heide saved two penalties to secure the shootout victory to cement Europe's growing dominance at youth level.</p>
