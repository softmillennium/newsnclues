The best Taylor Sheridan shows have accumulated their loyal, and large, followings for fairly obvious reasons: They're just damn good. The 55-year-old actor turned writer-producer knows how to write compelling characters and play them off each other in distinctive settings. Notorious for flying solo and exerting tremendous control over his projects, Sheridan's said he's usually on set during the week and then writes an entire episode of one of his shows on Saturdays — all fueled by regular B-12 shots, of course. Sheridan might do well to value quality over quantity a bit more, and perhaps, with the shrinkage of the streaming ecosystem and his departure from Paramount for NBCUniversal, he'll have an opportunity to reset. Ranking Taylor Sheridan's shows is not massively difficult because there are some that clearly stand out and others that sink to the bottom. Head TV Critic Ben Travers is more of a skeptic — he certainly doesn't agree that Sheridan's success stems from great writing (great casting seems more likely, plus a convenient dearth of prestige-flavored westerns) — and he's only found one or two of Sheridan's shows worthy of weekly viewing. IndieWire's list of Taylor Sheridan's shows, ranked from best to worst, is below. Ben Travers: Not to overextend whatever credit I have as our resident “hater,” but “Tulsa King” is my preferred Taylor Sheridan show because it's the least like all of Taylor Sheridan's other shows. “Tulsa King” is about a rag-tag group of outcasts who try to build something together, rather than a haunted family who fights all the time as their long-sullied legacy falls apart. Which one of those options sounds better to you? Thankfully, Winter made his way back to the fray (off and on), and “Tulsa King” was able to preserve parts of its original tone, while still getting Sylvester Stallone's hands dirty enough to fit in with Sheridan's other tough guys. It's far from the best of either writer (Winter or Stallone), and there's certainly a more serious crime drama stirring somewhere within this silly one. But when so many of Sheridan's shows feel like medieval torture chambers (misery, violence, more misery), I'm going to savor whatever time I can get with a kingly court jester. Christian Blauvelt: The turn away from miserabilism that “Tulsa King” represents for Sheridan is a welcome one, though I can't help think that this “crime comedy” series gets a little too silly for its own good on many occasions. And I wonder how much it would hold together at all if not for the star power of Stallone at its center. I also think that the show gets better once Sheridan left: I found the early part of Season 1 to be kind of a tract-in-show-form where Sheridan could spew his anti-woke sentiments without necessarily giving them much dramatic structure. I found those early eps to be as performatively about the “culture wars” as anything Sheridan has ever done, and given an added degree of inauthenticity because it feels at times that he's really a lefty just dressed in MAGA clothing. Similarly, I found that some of the culture warrior things he said on “The Joe Rogan Experience” ended up verbatim in “Lioness” Season 2. More on that in the “Lioness” blurb, but yes, this is where I can acknowledge that I was so high on the Sheridan-verse I literally listened to his entire three-hour-plus Joe Rogan podcast, which was another reminder about what a terrible interviewer Rogan is and a massive missed opportunity given how few interviews Sheridan grants. Anyway, once “Tulsa King” actually became a show about its characters rather than making a point to ruffle PC sensibilities it became the fun romp you describe. But though we are not here to bury Sheridan, we can certainly be clear-eyed about the limitations of his work as well. Christian: I mean, if any series brings tears to my eyes for the entire final episode that has to be a massive success, and for me “1883” is in every sense Sheridan's most perfectly formed show. This is the rare 10-episode series that actually does feel like a 10-hour movie, one devoid of flab and filler but that also never puts plot before character even as it's exquisitely plotted. A wagon-train Western for the ages, “1883” gives us our chronological first glimpse of the Dutton family as an impoverished first-generation Irish clan in Tennessee heading to parts West for a better life. Yes, it focuses on the trip's grind and misery, but not for the sake of miserabilism; more to establish real stakes, meaning, and purpose. It takes five episodes just for the wagon train to get out of Texas, and though that may be partly due to Sheridan being able to film that much more on his Texas ranch, it emphasizes what those seeking a better life in the West were willing to endure – largely on foot. And like any immigrant story, there's something incredibly hopeful at its core — a hope that justifies the grind. This is also one of the only Westerns other than “Heaven's Gate” to delve deep into the extraordinary diversity of those heading West — that they were very often immigrants from Germany, Sweden, Poland, the Balkans, and all over Eastern Europe, including persecuted Roma. Like “Heaven's Gate,” there isn't much English dialogue you hear from these characters and “1883” focuses on the misunderstandings that arise simply from the language barrier. Sheridan's writing of women can also be very bad across his work… and yet, he delivered the single most complex characterization of his entire writing career in Elsa (Isabel May), whose poetic narration anchors the series. As a classic Western gunslinger who suffers the loss of his entire family from smallpox before deciding to embark on one last journey to the Pacific as a wagon train boss, he ends up tugging at your heartstrings like no one else. Elsa's narration is a crutch, and her observations are too often vague platitudes that betray the insight she should have as a storyteller who knows the whole narrative. To that end, “1883” may acknowledge the American melting pot as it spills out across the plains, but its perspective remains rooted in a white family, which makes it familiar and limited. Women characters rank second only to Native Americans when it comes to Sheridan's vexing portrayals, and “1883” doesn't exactly work to acknowledge the ways in which the country's original settlers built a functioning society. That may not be fair to the story it does tell — with passion, earnestness, and ambition — but it's a historical fact that seems to butt against the writer's preferred American origin story. (And it makes his sadistic streak harder to stomach when the pioneers start dying off in disparate droves.) Elsewhere, James and Margaret Dutton (Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, respectively) don't do much for me as protagonists (or performers), which elevates Elliott's work almost by default. (I say almost because he is quite affecting, even if that SAG Award Actors Award should've gone to Steve Carell for “The Patient.”) Perhaps if “1883” weren't tied to “Yellowstone” — if it had been a true standalone project — some of these slights may have softened. Christian: What's so invigorating about “1923” Season 1 is how much Sheridan works in pure adventure mode. It's not miserabilism for miserabilism's sake, even in the repeated, brutal beatings suffered by Aminah Nieves' Teonna, an Indigenous girl forced to live in an abusive Catholic boarding school. And of course, it's all to set up a thrilling, cross-country revenge story for Teonna, which becomes the best part of Season 2 — maybe the only genuinely satisfying part of Season 2, when all is said and done. Yes, this show fizzles a bit by the end of its 16-episode run, and it's hard not to think that it would have been better served with less. But there's no storyline more purely fun and exciting in Sheridan's canon than that of big game hunter Spencer Dutton (Brandon Sklenar, in a breakout performance for the ages) finding romance with runaway British royal Alexandra (Julia Schlaepfer) on the East African savannah. Here, Sheridan thinks in terms of images for his storytelling in a way he doesn't always: When Spencer and Alexandra are adrift on the high seas following the aforementioned tugboat captain's death, they run afoul of an abandoned ocean liner “ghost ship” that causes them to wreck as well. Unfortunately, Season 2, with the exception of Teonna's revenge arc, does see Sheridan slipping back into his miserabilist tendencies. There's a godawful storyline where Dalton's land baron endlessly engages in sadomasochistic sex with two sex workers he's hired and is trying to turn against each other: Yes, it's trying to make a point about the entanglement of economic power and sexual abuse, but the point is established early and its continued elaboration calls into question Sheridan's own motives. Ben: You've done most of my hater work for me, Christian, so I'll just say Harrison Ford does a lot to make this grim western tolerable. In a rare cowboy role for the movie star, Ford's Jacob Dutton sports a perpetual grimace that's softened by our decades of affection for the actor himself. I don't know if I'd go as far as to say Sheridan relies on that endearing quality — he's going to tell his story, his way, no matter who's in the saddle — but it's certainly helpful to his audience. Ben: “Yellowstone” aside (kind of), Taylor Sheridan doesn't exactly have an established track record when it comes to creating sustainable TV series. But between “1883” (limited series), “Bass Reeves” (canceled after one season), and the relative infancy of his other “hit” shows, it's worth wondering whether any of his TV ideas are built to last. (Even “Tulsa King,” which is about to shoot its fourth season, has faced production issues every year! So the nicest thing I can say about “Mayor of Kingstown” is that it's proven it can go the distance. Relying on its star “Avenger” (if not a star “Avenger”) and a premiere episode twist straight out of “Game of Thrones,” the dark-and-gritty Michigan crime drama has produced four seasons in five years, all of which star Jeremy Renner's ex-con turned unofficial warden of a prison (Kings)town, Mike McLusky. Along the way, it's employed legends like Dianne Wiest and Edie Falco to bring emotional nuance to a series mired in merciless pain. Christian: It is an antihero show in an age of that's moved on from antiheroes — though I would argue that the Duttons in “Yellowstone” have basically become a crime family by that point, unlike their noble presentation in “1883” and “1923” — but the reason for that may also be that “Mayor of Kingstown” was the first series Sheridan wrote even though it wasn't the first to air. So it strangely has a whiff of the mid-2010s in many respects. Not particularly memorable, but, as you've said, oddly sustainable? Ben: Ah, “Yellowstone.” The unexpected hit that became the backbone of an entire network (and then its streamer, and then, come 2029, another streamer). The Kevin Costner-starring Western certainly benefited from his star power, helping to lure an audience eager for the sweeping American grandeur captured in “Dances with Wolves” and the next iteration of iconic cowboys glimpsed in “Silverado,” “Wyatt Earp,” and “Open Range.” While Sheridan's breakthrough series certainly delivered on those fronts — John Dutton's existential battle against progress, time, and death itself proved to be the series' most arresting conflict, which was only emphasized by Sheridan's many, many, many montages of cowboys riding across the ranch's purple mountain majesty — the behind-the-scenes battles between “Yellowstone's” principal patriarchs ruined a delayed, extended, and ultimately nonsensical final season. And when I say “ruined,” I mean the best of “Yellowstone” fell to Earth alongside its omnipresent worst traits: uneven pacing, clichéd, redundant character development, and a brutal streak that made scenes too silly to take seriously and too nasty to savor. Even for those who thought parts of “Yellowstone” were worthy of the awards love that never came, the ending emphasized exactly why Sheridan's first TV series deserved exactly what it got: big ratings, little relevance. Christian: I do agree that the way “Yellowstone” ended was so disastrous it mars the entire show — to me it's far worse than what happened with the “Lost” or “Game of Thrones” finales, and there's part of me that thinks “Yellowstone” should be ranked last here as a result. Especially since “1883” and “1923” do so many more interesting things with this kind of material. That said, there are times throughout its run that you can see very clearly why it became such a phenomenon, and I think part of it is due to its pacing: This could be as languid a series as any on TV, one largely about character rather than plot (which is why the plot-heavy contortions of its final season are such a betrayal). This is a show where you suddenly could have Gil Birmingham giving a long monologue about the relationship between men and wolves, and how each exist to keep the population of the other in check — several minutes in, I let out an audible “This is great.” Having the endless mean-spiritedness of Jamie (Wes Bentley) and Beth (Kelly Reilly) curdle into conspiracy nonsense and an ultimate knife fight very much did not. This is one of the most perceptive depictions in American media of that precise moment that Reconstruction transitioned into Jim Crow. The eight-part series tells an effective story about Reeves going from enslavement to the life of wearing a badge and building a family. It's overarching plot then concerns strange rumors of a “Mr. Sundown” who is spiriting away Black men accused of (often spurious) crimes, and Reeves' investigation has compelling implications for whether slavery ever fully went away or just became the culture of incarceration that's defined American judicial life ever since. The premiere is a regurgitation of Bass Reeves' Wikipedia page, the legendary lawman's characterization is as broad and accessible as any stock cop on CBS, and the whole show only came to be because Sheridan thought he could fit Reeves into the “Yellowstone” universe, couldn't quite make it work, and then stuck his name on a seasonal anthology that only lasted one season. Like much of Sheridan's work, it may have good ideas and great production values, but it struggles with the core of great television: characters. I love Oyelowo, and he does his darnedest to liven up a rudimentary historic retelling, but his good-hearted lawman is too disengaged from the world around him. The series isn't interested in the nuanced internal conflicts that must have roiled inside a former slave who chose to protect and serve slave owners, a Black man forced to fight for the Confederate army, or even a pacifist who picked up a gun every single day. Christian: One of Sheridan's greatest skills is spotting rising talent to champion: Isabel May in “1883,” Brandon Sklenar in “1923,” and I'd argue Laysla de Oliveira in “Lioness.” The spectrum of material she's asked to play in Season 1 is extraordinary: Stuck in an abusive relationship and working as a fast-food fryer, de Oliveira's Cruz finds a way out when, during a fight with her hateful significant other, she literally stumbles into a Marine recruiting office. It puts her on a journey to becoming a covert operative in the CIA's Lioness division, where certain women agents go undercover in terrorist organizations, drug cartels, and more. Of Mexican and Syrian heritage, Cruz, who can speak Arabic, is perfect to go undercover inside an Al-Qaeda-style terrorist organization. She's to befriend the daughter of its leader, who, along with her father, leads a luxe life of designer apparel and luxury goods. I'm not sure there's an actor in any of these shows who's been asked to do more than de Oliveira. It all boils down to a remarkably critical take on U.S. adventurism abroad, down to the inspired choice of casting “Egyptian Jon Stewart” Bassem Youssef as the amiable terrorist leader. Nicole Kidman as a CIA operative with a disturbingly husky “American” accent does not lend sympathy to the U.S. cause, nor does Zoe Saldana as an operative almost pathologically capable of severing the brutality of her job from her cozy private life. It's all full of Sheridan indulgences, including him playing a devil-may-care Special Forces operative who can't keep his shirt on and spouts lines he spoke verbatim about “not being able to have a conversation” about trans issues on “The Joe Rogan Experience.” But working in an “action mode” suits Sheridan, especially as he doesn't indulge in jingoism. Ben: I'm not sure if I'm fully sold on “Lioness” as a critical take on America's international policy — for all the moral hesitancy over what their missions ultimately accomplish, there's still too much “rah rah” support for the military industrial complex to be seen as a full-on condemnation — but I have to say, as a pure narrative, I find it tremendously dull. That, and Nicole Kidman gets stuck with one of the worst line readings of her career, while Zoe Saldana barely survives her heated confrontation with the titular lioness. There's something to be said for men sitting and shouting at each other in rooms, stirring up trouble until it nearly starts a war, while the women do the real work outside in the field… but “Lioness” doesn't fit that feminist interpretation, as much as it wants you to believe it can. Ben: Before you even get into the ugliness within “Landman's” story, you have to first consider how fundamentally irresponsible it is, even as a piece of fiction. Here's a show so in love with the sound of its own ultra-conservative voice, not only is it happy to prop up the oil industry by spouting lies about clean energy, it's also happy to cash the checks Big Oil throws its way to keep spreading misinformation about why oilfields are the future and wind turbines are for weaklings. No one measures up to Tommy's standards, and he may like it that way, but it makes for an exhausting viewing experience — who wants to let some old, stuck-up asshole bullshit for hours on end, when he's so sure he knows better than everyone but remains completely oblivious that he's blabbing out of his ass? It's a testament to Thornton's tough-talking charms that “Landman” is still watchable, just as it's a black mark against Taylor Sheridan that he can't see the tragedy inherent to Tommy's story — a man trapped in the American dream as it rots beneath his feet. Then there's “Landman.” Stephen Rodrick summed it up best in Rolling Stone when he asked of “Landman,” “Why does Jerry Jones have better lines than Demi Moore?” And that's even before considering the unfortunate writing for Ali Larter and Michelle Randolph's characters. Frankly, much of what I dislike about “Landman” is what similarly rubbed me the wrong way about those early eps of “Tulsa King”: You're right, Ben, that this series is “built on provocation.” It's almost like if Billy Bob Thornton's evil assassin character in the first season of “Fargo” was suddenly given a heroic reframing — Sheridan is all-in on valorizing the petro economy. It speaks to how muddled, perhaps deliberately, his politics are that he can have the entire Dutton franchise be about preserving and respecting the land (and demonizing miners at multiple turns) and then make a show with basically the theme “fuck the environment.” It's also just incredibly wasteful when it comes to its cast: That's what you do with Jon Hamm?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Benedict Cumberbatch has confirmed that he remains committed to adapting Rogue Male, the classic British novel that he says inspired Ian Fleming to write James Bond. Cumberbatch and his production company SunnyMarch announced in 2016 that they planned to adapt Geoffrey Household's book, but the feature film has yet to get off the ground. Speaking on the SmartLess podcast, hosted by Sean Hayes, Jason Bateman, and Will Arnett, Cumberbatch said he hoped to slate the shoot for 2026. He warned, however, that “there are other huge commitments involving cloaks floating about,” which appeared to be confirmation that he is reprising his role as Doctor Strange in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Miles Teller Blames "One Really Important Person" On 'Fantastic Four' For "F***ing It All Up" Elizabeth Olsen Says She's "Excited To See" Marvel's 'VisionQuest': "It Really Sounds Like A Trifecta" “We haven't got a filming date yet, but it's something we're trying to slate for next year,” Cumberbatch said. Published in 1939, Rogue Male follows an unnamed English sportsman who attempts to assassinate a European dictator, strongly implied to be Adolf Hitler. He is caught, tortured and left for dead, but escapes back to England, where he hides out in the countryside with enemy agents and police in pursuit. “When we first sat down to talk about this, [we thought] is this a bit of a guy's film?

Like many others in the public media sector, and the greater arts community, my team and I are now scrambling to accelerate our fundraising efforts. Fortunately, BPM also has private sector support, so we're not closing our doors. Some of our donors are stepping up in remarkable ways, but in today's anti-DEI climate, others are choosing to lie low. As grateful as we are for the help we received, it is unclear whether private philanthropy alone can fill the $1.8 million gap. For nearly 50 years, BPM has helped independent media makers bring stories about the global Black experience to the public. We've long served as a vital funding source for content creators whose projects make other funders uneasy. “Hip Hop: Beyond Beats & Rhymes,” “I Am Not Your Negro,” “Red Summers VR,” and “Mama Gloria” are among the hundreds of projects we've supported. Projects we fund sometimes provide source material for narrative films, video games and XR experiences, reaching even broader audiences. BPM's collaborations with PBS bring groundbreaking broadcasts, streaming projects, and community engagement initiatives to the public free of charge. These projects often do the difficult but necessary job of challenging norms and sparking lively, essential conversations. The $35K NEA grant we walked away from was modest, but it would have supported our community screenings program. Earlier this year, we were advised to avoid using words included on the government's growing list of disfavored words. The so-called “woke” terms include: diversity, inclusion, climate crisis, equity, systemic, racism, LGBTQ, social justice, minority-serving institution, pronouns, and Black, the first word in our name! Avoiding those words to placate a funder would compromise our very mission — one hard thing we just won't do. The fact that so many are small business owners and job creators in communities across the United States — and that public funding is a force multiplier in stimulating local economies — is too often missed in this discussion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Days before real-life Hallmark couple Erin Krakow and Ben Rosenbaum revealed they're expecting their first baby — thrilling “When Calls The Heart” fans with the news on November 26, 2025 — Rosenbaum gave EntertainmentNow a little glimpse into their private life. His comments, it turns out, included a sweet hint that he and Krakow, who've been married since June, have been focused on their newest roles as parents-to-be since wrapping filming on season 13. Rosenbaum, who stars in Hallmark Channel's Thanksgiving weekend premiere of “The Christmas Cup,” had to reschedule his initial interview with EntertainmentNow about the upcoming movie because he was stuck at an appointment. No big deal, of course — but now it's clear the dad-to-be has likely been to quite a few appointments lately, evidenced in part by the adorable pics Krakow posted of them with their dog, Willoughby, while holding up sonogram images to reveal their baby news. Rosenbaum also mentioned that they'd been catching up on doctor's appointments when he did sit down with EntertainmentNow, noting that since “When Calls the Heart” recently wrapped filming in Vancouver, he and Krakow have been settling back into “boring life stuff” at home in Los Angeles. “We do try to maintain some privacy away from set,” Rosenbaum said. “But with all good things, you know — travel, visit and see family, and then just the boring life stuff of, like, all the things that we've neglected while we've been up in Canada. “Honestly, when Erin and I first met, I actually saw her working the first time we met, and really just developed a crush on her talent,” Rosenbaum said. The two were able to spend time together in her native New York when a touring stage production he was in opened and closed there, he said, noting that gave them “more opportunities to connect, and a romance developed from there.” They surprised fans by posting wedding photos on June 23 and have shocked Hearties once again with their baby news five months later. Season 13 of “When Calls The Heart” is set to premiere on January 4, while “The Christmas Cup” starring Rosenbaum, Rhiannon Fish, and several WCTH castmates premieres on November 30 at 6 p.m. Eastern time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During a Thanksgiving-themed episode titled “Turkey Trot,” Hegseth, a former Fox News anchor and military general, was depicted as an Instagram Reels-obsessed content creator sent to town on Trump's orders to free Peter Thiel, who you might recall was arrested in the previous episode. Like, actually go and do something,” South Park's Trump tells Hegseth. Contestants can't speak ill of the royal family. Cartman recruits Token to his team in hopes of winning the $5,000 prize. In a send-up of the increasingly prevalent ideas of race science permeating through conservative circles, Cartman describes himself as a “racing scientist,” noting that Token's race always wins races. How a Mac-and-Cheese Recipe Turned Chef Tini Into TikTok's Thanksgiving Queen Katy Perry Poised to Recover $1.8 Million in Wild Montecito Mansion War The stage is thus set for an Eddington-style standoff, as Hegseth arrives in South Park and immediately mistakes the race for an Antifa uprising. The quick-thinking Secretary of War immediately starts live-streaming the event before being accosted by Director of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who ends up shooting a dog in a scenario seemingly plucked from Noem's memoir, which caused a stir during the 2024 election. This latest season of South Park has consistently raised eyebrows as it takes on the current administration's key figures head-on. All the while, they've battled their network, Paramount+, which recently completed a merger with David Ellison's Skydance in a deal that many believe came with political assurances to the current administration. For more than twenty years, South Park has made skewering pop culture its defining ethos. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It turned out to be a historic night for the Irwins! Fan-favorite Robert Irwin has officially won “Dancing with the Stars.” The win arrives ten years after Bindi earned her own historic Mirrorball trophy during season 21 with Derek Hough. Now, Robert has added a second shining prize to the family's legacy. Robert's victory capped a heated three-round, three-hour live finale in Los Angeles on Tuesday evening. The 21-year-old overcame a painful rib injury to defeat fellow finalists Jordan Chiles, Alix Earle, Dylan Efron, and Elaine Hendrix. His emotional season, which began with a visit to his father's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in August, made him a fan favorite from the start. By the final night, his win felt inevitable. His judges' choice quickstep to “Are You Gonna Be My Girl” by Jet showed clean footwork and a strong frame. His freestyle, performed to Avicii's “The Nights” and Sam Sparro's “Black & Gold,” leaned into full-throttle choreography and explosive lifts. He also excelled in the “instant dance challenge,” where he and partner Witney Carson received their style and song only minutes before performing. Despite entering the show with no dance background, Robert leaned into his natural charisma and physicality. After taking the Mirrorball trophy, Robert said he is heading into an even busier chapter of life. Witney chimed in that she will be with him soon. “Witney's coming down to Australia,” Robert said, as the dancer joked, “You're not getting rid of me that easy.” “I've been able to write my own legacy with Witney as we tell stories of positivity, vulnerability, passion and fun.” He also shared that this journey has been years in the making. A recently resurfaced 2015 video showed young Robert backstage during Bindi's winning season, saying he hoped to compete on the show someday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Xochitl Gomez claims she's “single” — but fueled speculation she's dating Robert Irwin with a pointed social media move. During Tuesday night's finale of “Dancing With the Stars” Season 34, which saw Irwin win the dance competition, Gomez, who won Season 32, was asked in an interview with “DWTS” pro Jan Ravnik whether she's “single.” Giggling, the actress insisted, “Yes, I am. Gomez concluded her slideshow with a picture of a much-younger Irwin holding the Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy his older sister, Bindi Irwin, won in 2015's “DWTS” Season 21. Robert, for his part, hasn't done much to dispel the romance rumors, which sparked after he and Gomez displayed undeniable chemistry while performing on “DWTS” together earlier this month. (The show's current contestants were paired with past champions for a dance relay.) “Everyone's asking if you and Xochitl are an item!” a TMZ paparazzo said to Robert as he arrived for practice.

Asked once again whether the pair are “an item or just friends,” Robert smiled and walked into the studio. Then ahead of Tuesday's show, Gomez was photographed paying the zookeeper a private visit outside his trailer.

Eno said in a press release, “After a year defined by unimaginable loss, grief and injustice, we want to end with an act of love for Palestine's children. 1—and turning that moment into vital life-saving support for Gaza's families.” Barghouti adds, “This lullaby from our Palestinian musical heritage has been with me since early childhood.

The alternative rock outfit is currently in Australia for a national tour, kicking Wednesday, Nov. 26 at Red Hill Auditorium in Perth, Western Australia, and visiting Brisbane, Thirroul and Melbourne, before wrapping up in Sydney. As the “Take Me Out” singers bang the drum for those dates, frontman Alex Kapronos stopped by Triple M for a chat with WA-based breakfast show hosts Robbie & Carly. Here's Why Tems Says She Won't Return to Uganda Any Time Soon With “Demagogue,” Franz Ferdinand proved once more that Scots don't mince their words. “From the wall straight to la cuenta/Those pussy grabbing fingers won't let go of me now,” the sing early on. When we wrote that song, he was only just going forward as a candidate. Kapronos “didn't hear anything back from him personally, although years ago he replied to a tweet of mine, which was bizarre,” he reveals. “It was like, ‘Who's this woman in our dressing room? “We left a very rainy, cold, dark Europe to come to a beautiful springtime Australia — and you feel that energy,” Kapronos remarks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Never let it be said that South Park isn't grateful for its ability to be a lot more timely than almost any other animated show on television, allowing the Comedy Central series to tackle almost any aspect of our modern political and social clusterfuck (that isn't the influence of any billionaires who might be personal friends with Trey Parker and Matt Stone, anyway). Certainly, no other cartoon on TV has now dived in more gleefully in tackling recent criticisms of American athletes and artists taking money from the government of Saudi Arabia, as the series did with its pre-Thanksgiving installment, “Turkey Trot.” (In this case, getting obsessed with “race science,” which involves him recruiting South Park's one Black kid onto his team to try to win the titular event.) Oh, and it got some swipes at Pete Hesgeth in there, but Hesgeth is so obviously buffoonish that even the series seems to realize that clowning on him—by depicting him as a rampant attention seeker in a fight with Kristi Noem to see who can milk more attention out of any given situation—is at least a little bit redundant. To some extent, the show drew from an older playbook, doing a bit of the old “both sides” maneuver: Having usual moral voice Token repeatedly try to drop out of the town's Saudi-backed Turkey Trot over the queasy feelings associated with taking Saudi money, only to have Cartman point out that ostracized regimes rarely improve on topics like human rights abuses. Or, to put it in the show's terms, asking if he wouldn't prefer “them to pay America for sports rather than hacking up reporters and paying Pete Davidson to do comedy?” (Kevin Hart also took a similar hit.)

Benjamin Flaherty's Feature Doc 'Shuffle,' a SXSW Grand Jury Winner, Debuts Theatrical Trailer Gaines helmed the movie from a script he co-wrote with Qasim Basir that is based on Amiri Baraka's play Dutchman. “The Dutchman is a bold, electrifying adaptation that captures the raw power of Amiri Baraka's play with unflinching style and urgency — exactly the kind of provocative, conversation-starting cinema that audiences are starving for right now,” says Inaugural Entertainment founder Kevin Weisberg. “For Inaugural Entertainment it is the exact type of film we can't wait to put in theater.” Marc [Danon], Mike [Arrieta], Kevin and Ryan [Adams] have been champions of this film since day one, which means the world to me.

Tarantino has regularly placed the movie, which was based on author Koushun Takami's 1999 novel of the same name, on his favorite movies list. “I do not understand how the Japanese writer didn't sue Suzanne Collins for every fucking thing she owns,” he said. Stupid book critics are not going to go watch a Japanese movie called Battle Royale so the stupid book critics never called her on it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's certainly the case with Chloé Zhao's efforts to revive Buffy The Vampire Slayer, with the Hamnet co-writer and director taking some time out of her press tour (for the very somber Shakespearean child-death drama) to wrestle with equally weighty issues of a more modern vintage: Angel, or Spike? This is per an interview Zhao recently did with Lauren Veneziani, a.k.a. DC Film Girl, who immediately turned the conversation away from Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, and toward Buffy ‘shipping talk. Zhao was just as game, though, especially on the topic of which of Buffy Summers' various boyfriends she rooted for in the series—provoking a possible schism when she revealed that she was in the camp of James Marsters' Spike, not Veneziani's preferred bloodsucker, David Boreanaz's Angel. (Détente was reached when both women acknowledged that Marc Blucas' Riley has grown on them over the years, for the basic reason of not being an emotionally repressed 300-year-old adolescent.) Mostly, though, it's just interesting to see Zhao fully fan out about the original series, speaking in a way that makes it clear that she's still super-invested in its stories of supernatural horror blending into young adult angst. Zhao's Buffy revival—which she's described as a “continuation” of the original series—is set to land on Hulu.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The podcaster, who is happily married to Jelly Roll, recounts her own experience with domestic violence in 2013-2016. While many of us are kicking back, feet up and chomping down on roast turkey with all the trimmings, Bunnie Xo is on a different type of mission this Thanksgiving. Bunnie is knuckling down to help women escaping domestic violence. The podcaster and her team are providing Thanksgiving dinner and care packages for women in transitional housing at the Mary Parrish Center, in search of a fresh start, a safer life. Here's Why Tems Says She Won't Return to Uganda Any Time Soon And that's exactly what we're doing today,” Bunnie tells Extra. Bunnie tells Extra she knows from experience how tough it can be out there. “Going through a situation personally around 2013 to 2016 with my own domestic violence relationship has just made this mission for myself,” she remarks, “even more of wanting to give back and wanting to be there for the women and the children that are going through this because I know how hard it is to get out.” Now happily married now to country star Jelly Roll, Bunnie hasn't forgotten those harrowing days, which she recounts in her new book “Stripped Down.” Speaking on her Dumb Blonde podcast, the host admitted that she has to turn herself in to serve time for unknowingly driving for years with a suspended license, those issues apparently tying back to a minor driving incident from half a decade ago. “It looks like your girl is gonna have to go book herself in.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas addressed their controversial “Dancing With the Stars” elimination during their appearance on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast Wednesday. Leavitt and Ballas were shockingly eliminated in the semi-finals of Season 34 of “DWTS,” after receiving high scores from the judges all season. However, the “Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” star, 32, didn't score well in the fan vote and she received intense backlash for having previous dance experience. Leavitt laughed off the criticism when asked about it by “Call Your Daddy” host Alex Cooper. She noted that while she did have a modern dance degree from Brigham Young University, the style of dancing on “DWTS” was definitely foreign to her. “Of course, that background helped learning different techniques but this was still very new to me.” Ballas pointed out that there hasn't been a season of “DWTS” where there wasn't a contestant with previous dancing experience, like past winners Nicole Scherzinger and Jordan Fisher. He said fans noticed it more with Leavitt because of her natural performance abilities. “She is a dynamic performer and that's something I can't teach,” he said. Ballas said that in all of his past seasons on “DWTS,” he had never seen fans actively band together to vote for every other couple just to force them out of the competition. He also got emotional while reading a hateful comment directed toward him online that called him “a c—nt,” “worthless” and wished he burned in hell. Ballas said he didn't sign up for that type of hate and only wanted to be on a fun dancing competition that brought people joy. For her part, Leavitt said she was used to the hate but was more affected by seeing Ballas experience it for the first time. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

The performance ended with a message reading, “Social media is bad for your health.” Robert Irwin ended up winning the Mirrorball Trophy on Tuesday with his partner, Witney Carson, after an epic three-hour finale. Irwin — a frontrunner all season long — praised his older sister, Bindi Irwin, who won the Mirrorball Trophy in 2015 with her partner, Derek Hough.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The federal complaint filed Tuesday in Nashville is the first major case to come under Tennessee's Ensuring Likeness Voice and Image Security Act (ELVIS) Act. Enacted in 2024, the ELVIS Act expanded the state's statutory right of publicity to protect a person's voice from being exploited. The manager of Cash's estate, the John R. Cash Revocable Trust, cited a song in a commercial, which has been airing since August during college football games. It is theft of his integrity, identity and humanity,” Tim Warnock of Loeb & Loeb, a lawyer for Cash's estate, wrote. While the Cash estate does license the late performer's intellectual property — such as his songs “Ragged Old Flag” and “Personal Jesus,” which were used in Super Bowl telecasts — the estate claims Coca-Cola “never even bothered to ask the trust for a license” in the case of this ad where they used a voice sounding like Cash that aired during college football games. According to the complaint, “This case arises from Coca-Cola's pirating Johnny Cash's voice in a nationwide advertising campaign to enrich itself — without asking for permission or providing any compensation to the humble man and artist who created the goodwill from which Coca-Cola now profits.” How a Mac-and-Cheese Recipe Turned Chef Tini Into TikTok's Thanksgiving Queen Katy Perry Poised to Recover $1.8 Million in Wild Montecito Mansion War Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
