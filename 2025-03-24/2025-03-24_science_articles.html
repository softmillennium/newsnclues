Donald Trump has shut down the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM) due to its alleged "radical propaganda".

Critics have long accused the agency of promoting anti-American ideas, but this contradicts previous criticisms that it was a propaganda arm of US foreign policy.

The Moscow Times reported Russian officials were elated by the demise of the "purely propagandistic" outlets, while China's Global Times celebrated the closure of a "lie factory".

The European Commission hailed USAGM outlets as a "beacon of truth, democracy and hope", leaving the average person confused about the purpose of Voice of America.

Voice of America was established during World War II to promote American interests abroad, but its current role is more complex.

The USAGM is one of several international public service media outlets based in western democracies, including Australia's ABC International, the BBC World Service, and Deutsche Welle in Germany.

These outlets are similar to national public service media, funded by taxpayers to uphold democratic ideals of universal access to news and information.

Unlike national public media, they typically provide news to countries without reliable independent media due to censorship or state-run media monopolies.

The USAGM provides news in 63 languages to more than 100 countries and has been credited with bringing attention to issues such as protests against COVID-19 lockdowns in China.

However, the independence of USAGM outlets has been questioned, particularly as they are required to share government-mandated editorials.

Voice of America has been criticized for its focus on perceived ideological adversaries such as Russia and Iran, and for perpetuating stereotypes and neglecting African nations in its news coverage.

These global media outlets wouldn't exist if there weren't benefits for the governments that fund them, sharing stories and perspectives that support or promote certain values and policies is an effective form of "public diplomacy".

The Voice of America's "firewall" prohibits interference by US government officials in reporting, allowing journalists to report on their own governments objectively.

In contrast, outlets such as China Media Group (CMG), RT from Russia, and PressTV from Iran reach a global audience through direct government involvement.

China has increased funding for its state-run news outlets, spending over $6.6 billion over 13 years, and CMG is one of the largest media conglomerates in the world.

After the ABC stopped broadcasting Radio Australia, China Radio International took over its frequencies, filling a media gap left by western democracies.

The differences between USAGM outlets and more overtly state-run outlets aren't immediately clear to audiences, as government ownership isn't advertised.

An Australian senator had to apologize after speaking with PressTV, not knowing it was affiliated with the Iranian government or sanctioned in Australia.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Asteroid 2014 TN17 is wider than the Great Pyramid of Giza is tall, and if it impacted our planet, it could wipe out a large city.

 
On Wednesday (March 26), at around 7:30 a.m. ET, asteroid 2014 TN17 will come within 3.2 million miles (5.1 million kilometers) of Earth — or around 13 times further away than the moon.

Researchers estimate that it is around 540 feet (165 meters) wide.

That is slightly wider than the height of Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza and makes it large enough to wipe out a city if it impacted our planet.

NASA classifies 2014 TN17 as "potentially hazardous" because of its size and occasional proximity to Earth. 

However, that does not mean it is dangerous.

During the upcoming flyby, the asteroid will be too far away to be observed with a backyard telescope or stargazing binoculars .

The space rock is currently scheduled to be observed by NASA's Goldstone Solar System Radar (GSSR) system in California, which specializes in observing nearby solar system objects as they pass us by.

There are currently around 2,500 known potentially hazardous asteroids, according to the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center .

One such space rock is the potential city-killer asteroid 2024 YR4, which made headlines earlier this year when the chances of it hitting our planet in 2032 rose as high as 3.1% . 

The odds of impact have since dropped to zero.

However, there is still a slim chance that it may crash into the moon .

GSSR images of asteroid 2024 MK revealed that the space rock's orbit had shifted after a close approach to Earth on June 29, 2024.

Another asteroid that will have a near-miss of Earth is the hefty "god of chaos" asteroid Apophis, which will come closer to our planet than some satellites in 2029.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Turkey is in turmoil after Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, was arrested on March 19 on charges of corruption.

The arrest has sparked protests, with over 1,000 people detained for demonstrating against it. Hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets, saying it's a major blow to democracy.

İmamoğlu denies all charges and has since been endorsed as the candidate for the 2028 presidential elections for the Republican People's Party (CHP).

Central to the allegations is "naylon faturacılık," or "nylon invoicing," which refers to issuing fake invoices. It doesn't just refer to simple errors, but deliberate attempts to fabricate transactions.

The practice is widespread in Turkey and forms part of the country's informal economy, which spans everything from street vending to complex tax evasion schemes.

Naylon faturacılık exposes how corruption thrives within formal systems, with a blurry boundary between formal and informal economic activity.

Turkey's Ministry of Finance uncovered 3 billion Turkish Lira worth of fake invoices in an investigation targeting around 4,500 large taxpayers in September 2024.

Over the past four years, more than 60 business owners, workers, and entrepreneurs across Turkey have described naylon faturacılık as "just part of doing business" in the informal economy.

It's a normalised practice that has become socially expected due to patchy enforcement and institutional fragility. Issuing or using fake invoices is punishable by three to eight years in prison under Turkish law.

Opposition leaders argue that İmamoğlu's arrest is politically motivated – an attempt to discredit their candidate ahead of the presidential election.

The leader of the CHP, Özgür Özel, condemned the operation as a "coup attempt" against Turkey's democratic future. He revealed that most of those detained are linked to companies that won public contracts from the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (İBB) under İmamoğlu's control.

Some detainees have no actual involvement in procurement decisions or public bids, according to Özel. The key accusation is that these companies issued fake invoices for work never done or exaggerated services.

Özel contends that no concrete evidence has been presented thus far and much of the government's case comprises testimony and vague associations from secret witnesses.

Critics say this reflects politically selective justice, as serious corruption allegations against former Ankara mayor Melih Gökçek remain uninvestigated.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The UK's 2015 Modern Slavery Act is ten years old on March 26.

The evidence tells a different story: the numbers of people identified as potential victims are higher than they have ever been, yet very few people have been prosecuted.

The Modern Slavery Act was championed by then home secretary Theresa May and primarily aimed to make it easier to identify and prosecute traffickers while offering protection to their victims.

It included a role for the private sector through a "transparency" clause requiring bigger businesses to report what they are doing to prevent modern slavery in their supply chains.

The act created an Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner, a legal defence for victims who had been forced to commit crimes, and gave law enforcement new powers to confiscate assets from traffickers.

However, the prevention strategy mainly consisted of poster campaigns in airports and immigration processing centres.

Some argued that the act dodged the big issues around work and immigration by not addressing weaknesses in labour protections and migrant workers' additional vulnerabilities.

The act has raised the issue's profile over the last ten years, with businesses now reporting on steps taken to tackle modern slavery.

Despite this, there are no penalties for non-compliance and limited progress on exploitation in supply chains.

Recent cases involving McDonald's and other supermarkets show that businesses are not spotting signs or acting effectively to prevent the issue.

The number of people identified as potential victims of modern slavery has increased significantly over the last ten years: 19,125 in 2024, nearly six times as many as in 2015.

This is partly because the act has improved awareness among frontline responders who refer potential victims for support.

However, prosecutions are very low: only 64 adult offenders were sentenced between 2017-19 for over 22,756 potential victims of modern slavery identified during that period.

Many reasons contribute to this, including victims not coming forward due to fear of detention or deportation.

Immigration policies passed by the last Conservative government have rolled back protections for modern slavery victims.

The Nationality and Borders Act and Illegal Migration Act argued that people arriving on small boats were abusing Modern Slavery Act protections to evade deportation.

The UK became non-compliant with international anti-trafficking and human rights laws as a result.

Many concerns raised during the drafting of the legislation have proven accurate, including repeated commitments to create a unified labour inspectorate.

Despite this, successive governments have dodged reform of labour market regulation.

The UK's immigration and work visa system has led to potential exploitation, even in legal migration routes and sponsorship visas.

Legal migration schemes like agriculture or social care have created conditions for people to be exploited due to intermediaries selling false promises.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Founded in 1870 as Missouri School of Mines, Missouri University of Science and Technology primarily educated mining engineers and surveyors.

The campus really started to grow right after World War II. As the need for engineers and scientists grew, so did the university. The campus evolved into a world-class technological research university, one that was making an impact beyond the state and nation.

In 1964, the institution’s name was changed to the University of Missouri-Rolla. UMR was the technology flagship of the four-campus University of Missouri System.

Then, in 2008, the name officially became Missouri University of Science and Technology. As a technological research university, Missouri S&T is a member of a small but elite group of American institutions that distinguish themselves by having a mission-based commitment to improving the world through the study and application of advanced sciences and technology.

There are 16 technological research universities in the nation, including MIT, Caltech, Missouri S&T, Rensselaer, Georgia Tech and the Colorado School of Mines.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silicon-tomatoes-kill-pests-pinworms'>How silicon turns tomato plants into mean, green, pest-killing machines</a></h2><b>Source:</b> sciencenews&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 15:00:00 <p>
Tomato plants on four continents are currently under attack from the South American tomato pinworm (Tuta absoluta), which destroys billions of dollars of crops each year.

These pinworms, also known as tomato leaf miners, have become resistant to heavily used chemical pesticides.

Researchers knew that adding silicon to soil can fortify some crops against pests. Some plants use the element to physically strengthen their cells; tomatoes use silicon to kick-start a complex array of biochemical and genetic defense systems.


When the researchers supplemented tomato plants' soil with silicon-containing nanoparticles and exposed the plants to pinworm moths, the tomato stems produced a mysterious dark goo at the base of hairlike structures called trichomes.

This dark substance appeared to lure pinworm mothers into laying eggs more frequently on tomato stems, instead of mostly on leaves. When pinworm caterpillars hatched and ate this "larval toffee," they often did not survive.


The researchers analyzed the gooey substance and found a blend of sugars and wax. This mix was enticingly sweet but contained the wrong blend of nutrients to support caterpillar growth.

To make matters worse for the pinworms, this plant potion also altered caterpillar microbiomes. Droppings from pinworms that ate the substance released a blend of gases that attracted two different species of pinworm-killing insects.


The researchers say that this study is the first step toward testing various silicon formulations for optimal crop yield and pest resistance, which could ultimately apply to other similar insects as well as the tomato pinworm.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Canadians head to the polls on April 28. Like other recent general elections, both in Canada and around the world, this federal election campaign is sure to be characterized by polarized misinformation.

We all have someone in our families or social circles who has political opinions grounded in false or misleading information. Whether the source of that information is Russian bots on social media, high-profile podcasters or Fox News, it’s easy to dread election-time conversations as misinformation strains our most important relationships.

My research shows that polarization and misinformation often go hand in hand, and when they do, the information being spread is strongly resistant to being corrected by way of evidence. But when we truly begin to listen to the people who believe misinformation, we can often help counter false claims.

So in this upcoming election, how can we push back against election misinformation when we hear it? Let’s examine some strategies.

Most people think that others who believe misinformation will change their minds if provided with the right evidence, but that’s simply not true. People have good reasons for not wanting to change their minds, even when confronted with contradictory facts.

One of the key personality traits linked to the belief in misinformation turns out to be anxiety. This can manifest in ways that resist correction. For example, most of us feel anxious when we have to hold two conflicting beliefs at the same time.

Anxiety about the future can drive people to accept misinformation that helps to relieve those fears. Taken together, this means that correcting political misinformation cannot be accomplished solely by providing evidence.

We need to mitigate these anxieties while engaging in gentle correction since outright correcting can make the anxieties worse. The ‘AIMS’ method is a proven approach for pushing back against polarizing misinformation.

The AIMS method stands for Announce, Inquire, Mirror and Secure. It provides a way to address misinformation while building the sort of connection and trust that people need to reduce the anxiety that is the trigger for believing misinformation in the first place.

Announce occurs when the topic is approached, often when someone announces a piece of political misinformation. This usually happens naturally during conversations about politics.

Inquire is where motivational interviewing really begins to differ from a conventional approach of simply providing evidence to back up a false claim. In this step, it’s essential to ask questions and approach the misinformation with curiosity.

As you probe more deeply, you engage in the Mirror step, checking in and repeating what you’re hearing so that the person recognizes they're being heard.

The Mirror step also allows you to introduce pieces of evidence that disprove the claims being made, but only after understanding the person’s concerns and reflecting them back.

Managing how you introduce contradictory evidence is crucial. It must be done with compassion and a gentle but reassuring manner.

Finally, when all concerns have been addressed, you can begin the Secure trust step. Here, you follow up on the announcement that sparked the discussion and see if the person now feels differently than they did before.

Combating any misinformation, especially political misinformation, is not a quick or easy process. It may require repeated discussions over an extended period.

Political misinformation is particularly challenging to counter because it's often tied deeply to people’s self-identity, and shared within social groups.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

George Franklin was convicted of murder in 1990 based on his daughter Eileen's testimony, who described seeing him rape her best friend and then smash her skull with a rock.

Eileen testified about the murder when she was 28 years old, but it had happened 20 years earlier when she was 8 years old. 

According to the prosecution, Eileen repressed her memory of the murder, which she later recovered in complete detail.

Memory researchers argue that there is no credible scientific evidence that repressed memories exist.

The concept of repression originated with Sigmund Freud, who considered it a defense mechanism people use to protect themselves from traumatic experiences.

Freud's view was that repressed memories make themselves known by leaking out in mental and physical symptoms, which can be relieved only through recovering the traumatic memory.

In the 1980s, therapists began using techniques such as hypnosis, suggestive questioning, and group sessions to help clients recover repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse.

Many people who entered therapy for common mental health issues came out with new and unexpected memories of childhood sexual abuse and other trauma, without physical evidence or corroboration from others.

However, scientists argue that traumatic events tend to be very well remembered over long intervals of time.

Trauma sometimes is too well remembered, as in the case of post-traumatic stress disorder.

Recurrent and intrusive traumatic memories are a core symptom of PTSD.

Not remembering traumatic experiences doesn't necessarily mean the memory has been repressed.

There are alternative explanations for not remembering traumatic events, such as memory decay or motivated forgetting.

Biological causes of forgetting, such as brain injury and substance abuse, can also occur.

Trauma can interfere with the making of a memory in the first place, resulting in little to no memory of what happened.

If science rejects the notion of repressed memories, researchers are left with the question: Where do newly recollected trauma memories come from?

Memory researchers contend that memory recovery techniques might actually create false memories of things that never happened rather than resurrect existing memories of real experiences.

To study this possibility, researchers asked participants to elaborate on events that never happened using suggestive questioning techniques.

What they found was startling: almost one-third of participants were able to induce richly detailed false memories of a wide range of childhood traumatic experiences.

The belief in repressed memories remains well entrenched among the general public and mental health professionals.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

President Donald Trump wants Ukraine to repay the United States for helping to defend the country against Russia’s invasion.

Since 2022, Congress has provided about US$174 billion to Ukraine and neighboring countries to assist its war effort. Trump inflated this figure to $350 billion in a March 2025 White House meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. 

Ukraine is rich in titanium, graphite, manganese and other rare earth metals used to produce electric vehicle batteries and other tech devices.

Mining and refining these critical mineral resources would require major investment in infrastructure and economic development, including in parts of Ukraine severely damaged by fighting.


For the U.S., the economic gains of the Marshall Plan did not come from European countries’ repaying loans or allowing the U.S. to extract their raw materials. Rather, the U.S. has benefited enormously from a half-century of goodwill, democratic stability and economic success in Europe.

European nations turn inward

After World War II ended in 1945, Western Europe faced a staggering burden of destruction and upheaval.

Allied bombardment of major industrial areas and German cities such as Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne had created massive housing shortages. Meanwhile, fighting through agricultural areas and a critical manpower shortage had curtailed food production.


The continent was politically and militarily divided, too. Europe’s western half was influenced by the democratic, capitalistic forces led by the U.S. Eastern Europe was beholden to the communist, command-economy forces of the Soviet Union.

In a 1946 speech at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill articulated Europe’s growing postwar divide. Over the ruins of proud nations, he said, “an iron curtain” had “descended across the continent.”

US looks abroad

Unlike Europe, the U.S. emerged from World War II as the wealthiest nation in the world, with its territory intact and unharmed. Its steel and oil industries were booming.


President Harry Truman feared the ambitions of the war’s other great victor – the Soviet Union. In March 1947, he announced a new doctrine to contain communist expansion southward across Europe by giving $400 million in military and economic aid to Greece and Turkey.

Around the same time, U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall met with Soviet officials to plan Germany’s future. Following the Nazis’ surrender, Germany had been occupied by the four main Allied powers – the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union.


NATO is born

Along with economic stability, the Truman administration recognized that Europe needed military security to defend against communist encroachment by the Soviet Union.

In July 1949, 12 European countries, the U.S. and Canada established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. NATO committed each member country to the mutual defense of fellow NATO members.


Ukraine applied for NATO membership in 2022 after Russia’s invasion. Its application is pending. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said any peace deal with Ukraine must bar NATO membership.

Would a Marshall Plan work for Ukraine?

Modern-day Ukraine mirrors the Western European countries of the Marshall Plan era in meaningful ways.

It suffers from the physical devastation of war, with its major cities heavily damaged.

The threat of military attack from hostile neighbors remains urgent.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In the 20th century, when a routine infection was treated with a standard antibiotic, recovery was expected. But over time, the microbes responsible for these infections have evolved to evade the very drugs designed to eliminate them.

Each year, there are more than 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections in the United States, leading to over 35,000 deaths and US$4.6 billion in health care costs. As antibiotics become less effective, antimicrobial resistance poses an increasing threat to public health.

Antimicrobial resistance began to emerge as a serious threat in the 1940s with the rise of penicillin resistance. By the 1990s, it had escalated into a global concern. Decades later, critical questions still remain: How does antimicrobial resistance emerge, and how can scientists track the hidden changes leading to it?

Over the years, my work as a microbiologist and biomedical scientist has focused on investigating the genetics of infectious microbes. My colleagues and I identified a resistance gene previously undetected in the U.S. using genetic and computational methods that can help improve how scientists detect and track antimicrobial resistance.

Antimicrobial resistance is a natural process where microbes constantly evolve as a defense mechanism, acquiring genetic changes that enhance their survival. Unfortunately, human activities can speed up this process.

The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in health care, farming and the environment push bacteria to genetically change in ways that allow them to survive the drugs meant to kill them.

Early detection of antimicrobial resistance is crucial for effective treatment. Surveillance typically begins with a laboratory sample obtained from patients with suspected infections, which is then analyzed to identify potential antimicrobial resistance.

Traditionally, this has been done using culture-based methods that involve exposing microbes to antibiotics in the lab and observing whether they survived to determine whether they were becoming resistant.

Along with helping authorities and researchers monitor the spread of antimicrobial resistance, hospitals use this approach to decide on treatment plans.

However, culture-based approaches have some limitations. Resistant infections often go unnoticed until antibiotics fail, making both detection and intervention processes slow.

Additionally, new resistance genes may escape detection altogether.

To overcome these challenges, researchers have integrated genomic sequencing into antimicrobial resistance surveillance.

Through whole-genome sequencing, we can analyze all the DNA in a microbial sample to get a comprehensive view of all the genes present – including those responsible for resistance.

With the computational tools of bioinformatics, researchers can efficiently process vast amounts of genetic data to improve the detection of resistance threats.

Despite its advantages, integrating genomic sequencing into antimicrobial resistance monitoring presents some challenges of its own.

High costs, quality assurance and a shortage of trained bioinformaticians make implementation difficult.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/how-many-types-of-insects-are-there-in-the-world-247333'>How many types of insects are there in the world?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 12:48:18 <p>
Sawyer, age 8, Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina asked: How many types of insects are there in the world?

There are more kinds of insects than there are mammals, birds and plants combined.

Biologists classify all living things into categories.

Insects belong to a phylum called Arthropoda – animals with hard exoskeletons and jointed feet.

All insects are arthropods, but not all arthropods are insects.

For instance, spiders, lobsters and millipedes are arthropods, but they're not insects.

Instead, insects are a subgroup within Arthropoda, a class called “Insecta,” that is characterized by six legs, two antennae and three body segments – head, abdomen and the thorax.

Most insects also have wings, although a few, like fleas, don't.

All have compound eyes, which means insects see very differently from the way people see.

Instead of one lens per eye, they have many: a fly has 5,000 lenses; a dragonfly has 30,000.

These types of eyes, though not great for clarity, are excellent at detecting movement.

What is a species?

All insects descend from a common ancestor that lived about 480 million years ago.

A species is the most basic unit that biologists use to classify living things.

When people use words like “ant” or “fly” or “butterfly” they are referring not to species, but to categories that may contain hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of species.

For example, about 18,000 species of butterfly exist – think monarch, zebra swallowtail or cabbage white.

Species are a group that can interbreed with each other, but not with other groups.

One obvious example: bees can’t interbreed with ants.

But brown-belted bumblebees and red-belted bumblebees can’t interbreed either, so they are different species of bumblebee.

Each species has a unique scientific name – like Bombus griseocollis for the brown-belted bumblebee – so scientists can be sure which species they’re talking about.

Counting the exact number of insect species is probably impossible.

Every year, some species go extinct, while some evolve anew.

Even if we could magically freeze time and survey the entire Earth all at once, experts would disagree on the distinctiveness or identity of some species.

So instead of counting, researchers use statistical analysis to make an estimate.

One scientist did just that. He published his answer in a 2018 research paper.

His calculations showed there are approximately 5.5 million insect species, with the correct number almost certainly between 2.6 and 7.2 million.

Beetles alone account for almost one-third of the number, about 1.5 million species.

By comparison, there are “only” an estimated 22,000 species of ants.

This and other studies have also estimated about 3,500 species of mosquitoes, 120,000 species of flies and 30,000 species of grasshoppers and crickets.

The estimate of 5.5 million species of insects is interesting.

What’s even more remarkable is that because scientists have found only about 1 million species, that means more than 4.5 million species are still waiting for someone to discover them.

In other words, over 80% of the Earth’s insect biodiversity is still unknown.

Add up the total population and biomass of the insects, and the numbers are even more staggering.

The 22,000 species of ants comprise about 20 trillion individuals.

Most insects have little to no direct impact on people, but they are integral parts of their ecosystems.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

"Demon Slayer: Mugen Train," which shattered Japanese box-office records for earnings and ended up as 2020’s highest-grossing film in the world, is a prime example of how anime engages with these profound themes.

Spiritual themes in anime often explore spiritual and philosophical questions by drawing on Japan’s religious traditions to examine themes of fate, self-sacrifice and the struggle between desire and duty. Hayao Miyazaki's "Princess Mononoke" follows Prince Ashitaka, who is cursed by a demon and must journey to find a cure.

His quest leads him into a conflict between the industrialized Irontown, which seeks to expand by clearing forests, and the spirits of the natural world, including the Deer God, a divine being that governs life and death. The film reflects Shinto principles by portraying nature as sacred and inhabited by “kami,” or spiritual beings.

It emphasizes harmony between humans and the environment and the consequences of disrupting this balance. Scholar Melissa Croteau notes how Miyazaki's films use nature spirits to critique modernity’s detachment from the sacredness of the environment.


Similarly, his 2001 animated film "Spirited Away" reflects animist ideas in Japanese culture, where spirits are believed to inhabit natural elements and even everyday objects. Set in a mysterious Japanese bathhouse filled with “kami,” 10-year-old Chihiro learns to navigate this hidden world and transforms along the way.

A key moment in the film is the arrival of a polluted river spirit, which appears as a filthy, sludge-covered creature but is revealed to be a once-pristine river god, burdened by human waste. This scene embodies the animist belief that natural entities have their own spirit and must be respected.


“Neon Genesis Evangelion,” a landmark Japanese anime television series that aired from 1995 to 1996, engages with deep philosophical ideas, particularly existentialist questions of identity and purpose. Set in a postapocalyptic world, the series follows 14-year-old Shinji Ikari who is recruited to pilot a giant biomechanical weapon called an evangelion.


As Shinji and his fellow pilots struggle with their roles, the series explores themes of isolation, self-worth and the challenges of forming close, meaningful relationships. It draws from both Buddhist and Gnostic thought, which emphasize a focus on inner transformation and spiritual growth.


The battle between Rengoku and Akaza is more than a fight between good and evil; it is a clash between two worldviews – selflessness versus egoism, acceptance versus attachment. “Mugen Train” taps into universal human struggles, making its themes resonate far beyond Japan.

The film's exploration of impermanence, moral duty and the pursuit of meaning contributes to anime’s broader legacy as a medium that entertains while provoking deep philosophical reflection.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

America’s public lands, from its majestic national parks to its vast national forests, are at the heart of the country’s identity.

They cover more than a quarter of the nation and large parts of the West. Some are crisscrossed by hiking trails and used by hunters and fishermen. Ranchers graze cattle on others. In many areas, the government earns money through oil, gas, timber and mining leases.

These federally managed public lands have long enjoyed broad bipartisan support, as have moves to turn them into protected national parks and monuments. Research consistently shows that a majority of Americans want their congressional representatives to protect public access to these lands for recreation. One avenue for protection is the creation of national monuments.

But the status of national monuments can change. Presidents have expanded and contracted national monuments, as the U.S. saw with Bears Ears National Monument in Utah over the course of the past three presidencies.

The rules for the use and maintenance of various public lands can also change, and that can affect surrounding communities and their economies.

The U.S. is likely to see changes to public lands again under the second Trump administration. One of the new administration’s early orders was for the Department of Interior to review all national monuments for potential oil and gas drilling and mining.

At least two national monuments that President Joe Biden created in California are among the new administration’s targets.

The avenue for many of these changes is rooted in one century-old law: the Antiquities Act.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Living in a disadvantaged neighborhood contributes to a rare form of heart failure known as peripartum cardiomyopathy, which disproportionately affects Black mothers.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy can occur in pregnant or postpartum mothers during late pregnancy up to five months after birth and is difficult to identify and often misdiagnosed. Multiple studies estimate that 7% to 20% of U.S. mothers who have it don’t survive.


The study examined over 7.3 million birth records in California between 1997 and 2019 using the neighborhood deprivation index, which measures socioeconomic disadvantage in a geographic area. The researchers linked hospital discharge and vital records information up to 12 months postpartum follow-up on each woman to develop a more complete picture of why women developed the illness.


The study found that living in poor neighborhoods with fewer resources was associated with a 20% to 70% increased risk of developing peripartum cardiomyopathy. Those in the most under-resourced neighborhoods had the highest risk, which remained true even after accounting for other factors like income, race, high blood pressure, and obesity.


The researchers also found that living in highly stressed neighborhoods explained only part of the reason for the higher rates of peripartum cardiomyopathy in Black women. Even if they lived in better neighborhoods, Black women were still more than three times as likely to develop the condition than others.


The study suggests deeper issues are contributing to the increase in the disease, particularly in Black women. Barriers to healthcare include insurance gaps, transportation issues, biases of doctors and providers, and inadequate access to care.

A better understanding of these factors can help policymakers develop effective interventions for all women at risk and reallocate resources – and dollars – to prevent disparities in maternal health outcomes.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bad Bunny is one of the biggest stars in music, becoming Spotify's most-streamed artist for three years in a row.

Earlier this year, Bad Bunny co-hosted "The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon" and announced a 21-show residency in Puerto Rico, prompting the mayor of San Juan to comment that the artist had done a better job promoting Puerto Rico than the island's official destination marketing organization.

Discover Puerto Rico was founded in 2017 to market the island to tourists and investors. 

Historically, place-branding campaigns have been led by governments seeking to attract tourism and investment.

Puerto Rico has seen various branding efforts over the years, including early boosterism efforts during the first half of the 20th century and the creation of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company in 1970.

During Puerto Rico's deepening fiscal crisis in the 2010s, branding efforts remained a bipartisan priority, but each administration rebranded the island, raising concerns about consistency.

The "Isla Estrella" campaign was launched before Discover Puerto Rico took control over place-branding efforts in 2017.

Discover Puerto Rico has been polarizing, with critics pointing to significant blunders, including an early ad that sparked backlash for featuring a family that didn't look like most Puerto Ricans.

Beyond its marketing blunders, Discover Puerto Rico has struggled to navigate Puerto Rico's politically charged place-branding landscape.

Just a day before Mayor Romero made his remark about Bad Bunny, Discover Puerto Rico's CEO resigned, taking a similar role in St. Louis.

At the same time the future of Discover Puerto Rico remains uncertain, the island has gained unparalleled international attention thanks to popular music.

Reggaetón, an urban genre that originated in Puerto Rico in the 1990s, has amassed a massive global fan base, extending beyond Puerto Rico and Latin America to the rest of the world.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

There may be no kitchen table issue in America more critical than the price of food.

When the price of eggs rose over 40% from 2024 to 2025, it became a headline news story in Colorado and across the nation.

Public officials and the media blamed high egg prices on bird flu outbreaks and said containing the outbreak in supply chains would lower prices. 

In early March 2025, egg prices fell in the U.S., but these trends are likely to reverse due to higher seasonal demand during Easter and Passover.

Rising prices and market volatility have led to food costs climbing to 11.4% of American’s disposable income, the largest percentage since 1991.

Arresting these rising costs means reinventing supply chains to address the growing supply, demand and price volatility that has created uncertainty for consumers since the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.

Colorado faces a double whammy where egg prices are concerned. It’s one of nine states with a cage-free egg mandate, which requires all eggs sold in the state to come from cage-free facilities.

The regulation has been shown to increase the price of eggs by as much as 50%. Over the past two decades, cage-free egg laws have been passed in states as consumers have grown more concerned with the welfare of farm animals.

Colorado is the 28th largest egg producer in the U.S., far behind Midwestern states such as Iowa, Indiana and Ohio. Colorado has a few large producers such as Morning Fresh Farms, as well as smaller ones.

Nevada is pulling back on its cage-free egg mandate to deal with the challenge of unaffordable egg prices. But cage-free laws are not the main driver of increasing egg prices.

The egg supply chain needs to be reinvented to balance price, scale, resiliency and stability. What is driving up the prices of eggs and other consumer goods is the concentration of producers.

The COVID-19 pandemic revealed just how vulnerable prices and supply chains are. Five years ago this month, when the pandemic started, many products became unavailable and more expensive.

In 2022, a major product recall of Similac led to a baby formula shortage in the U.S. The baby formula market is highly concentrated, with four companies responsible for approximately 90% of the domestic market.

A large-scale facility that produced the baby formula was found to have unsanitary conditions and contaminated products. Pulling this one facility offline at the same time the nation was coping with pandemic-related supply chain issues led to the shortage.

Then at the beginning of 2024, supplies of insulin ran short due to production issues at Eli Lilly, one of the three companies responsible for over 90% of the U.S. insulin market.

And in the second half of 2024, hospitals couldn’t get enough baby formula and other products due to supply chain disruptions.

The solution may increase prices. Policymakers want to reduce the spread of disease at American egg factories to mitigate the spread of bird flu. 

Factory farms increase the potential for viruses to spread rapidly and even mutate. Therefore, bird flu is a more serious precursor of supply chain disruption than a hurricane or product recall because it has the potential to create a public health crisis.

One solution to limit the spread of bird flu is to regulate the number of hens allowed in a single facility. This would lead to smaller and more farms across the U.S., but also higher consumer prices.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

2D bismuth transistors are less brittle and more flexible than transistors made using conventional silicon.

Researchers in China say they have created a new silicon-free transistor that could significantly boost performance while reducing energy consumption.

The team says this development represents a new direction for transistor research.

The scientists said that the new transistor could be integrated into chips that could one day perform up to 40% faster than the best existing silicon processors made by U.S. companies like Intel.

Despite that dramatic increase in power, the researchers claim that such chips would also draw 10% less power.

A new kind of silicon-free transistor

The efficiency and performance gains are possible thanks to the chip's unique architecture, the scientists said in the paper, specifically the new two-dimensional silicon-free transistor they created.

This transistor is a gate-all-around field-effect transistor (GAAFET). Unlike previous leading transistor designs like the fin field-effect transistor (FinFET), a GAAFET transistor wraps sources with a gate on all four sides, instead of just three.

At its most basic level, a transistor is a semiconductor device found in every computer chip. Each transistor has a source, a gate and a drain, which allow the transistor to function as a switch.

The gate is how a transistor controls the flow of current between the source and drain terminals and can act as both a switch and amplifier. 

2D bismuth transistors are less brittle and more flexible than traditional silicon, the scientists added in the study. Bismuth provides better carrier mobility —the speed at which electrons can move through it when an electrical field is applied. It also has a high dielectric constant — a measure of a material's ability to store electrical energy — which contributes to the transistor’s increased efficiency.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/what-does-the-ukraine-ceasefire-mean-for-europe-252852'>What does the Ukraine ceasefire mean for Europe?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 11:24:37 <p>
Several weeks have now passed since the infamously heated argument between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump on February 28 in the Oval Office. Zelensky has now accepted the partial ceasefire demanded by the US, paving the way for negotiations to reach a peace agreement with Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has been reluctant to accept the US proposal for a full cessation of hostilities. So far, he has only agreed to halt attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Putin is most likely weighing up the possibility of an eventual collapse of the Ukrainian front.

At the very least, he will be seeking to consolidate his advantage, and to negotiate from a position of strength that would allow him to impose conditions on peace negotiations. As a bare minimum, these conditions would include keeping occupied Ukrainian territory, keeping Ukraine out of Western institutions like the EU and Nato, and avoiding the deployment of Nato forces.

However, even if a negotiation were to give him all this, the underlying geopolitical issue that drove Putin to war would be far from resolved. Controlling Ukraine is a cornerstone of Russia’s territorial bulwark, which it considers essential for its security in the west.

Russia is far from having achieved the aims of its 2022 invasion. A peace that does not fully satisfy its security needs will, for Russia, be a bad peace, and will leave questions open.

As a natural consequence, it is prudent to prepare in order to avoid, or confront, further conflict in the future.

With the exception of brief visits to the White House by a several of its leaders, Europe has been left out of negotiating efforts. It has been ignored on an issue that, if only for geographical reasons, concerns it directly.

This disregard shows how little the continent matters to its North American partner, and forces European states to face existential questions. In fairness, Russia harbours no imperialist intentions (though one can never truly know how it would act if it were to find a clear path to the Atlantic), but it does want to restore the security shield it lost at the end of the Cold War.

We cannot rule out the possibility that, in the future, it might insist on this if the geostrategic conditions are right. This is a source of acute concern for policy-makers in Eastern European states, particularly those of the Baltic republics.

On its own, Europe cannot guarantee Ukraine the support it received from the West when the US was involved in the war effort. From a pragmatic point of view, it has little choice. It will probably accept the US effort to end the war, trying to make its voice heard in the process and, if Russia accepts it, go as far as deploying peacekeeping troops.

European strategic autonomy

In the meantime, the continent should not let up in the effort it has begun to strengthen its defence capabilities. It needs this not only as a deterrent, but also as the only way to maintain US interest in Nato, which remains vital to European security.

Assuming there is no going back on the project of political integration, Europe needs sufficient, credible military power (and power projection) if its voice is to be heard in an increasingly harsh international arena.

Ongoing efforts to achieve real strategic autonomy must also cultivate and strengthen the transatlantic link. Neither the US nor Europe has an interest in damaging, let alone severing, their relations.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In the United States, the number of deaths that didn’t have to happen has risen over time.

From 2009 to 2019, the average rate of avoidable deaths rose by 33 per 100,000 people across the country.

Members of the European Union experienced an average decrease of 24 per 100,000 over the same time period. And countries that are part of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development — which come from North America, South America, Europe and Asia — reported an average decrease of 19 per 100,000.

Avoidable mortality is a metric for how well health systems are working. It adds up the annual number of deaths among those under 75 years old that, with timely health care, wouldn’t have happened.

The average number of avoidable deaths across all U.S. states in 2019 was roughly 280 per 100,000 people. The umbrella of avoidable mortality includes both preventable and treatable deaths.

Preventable deaths — such as those from vaccine-preventable diseases and traffic collisions — are those that may be avoidable through public health prevention measures. Treatable mortality refers to deaths from conditions such as sepsis or appendicitis that may be avoidable with appropriate medical care.

The eclipse will be more modest in other areas of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. New York City will experience 21% obscuration, and the coverage will be less in Philadelphia (11%); Rochester, New York (8%); and Washington, D.C. (1.2%).

A 'double sunrise' will be possible from some locations as the silhouette of the moon makes the rising sun look like two separate "horns" emerging from the horizon.

Atlantic Canada will see a smaller eclipsed sunrise, with the eclipse deepening shortly thereafter. Moncton, New Brunswick, will see 84%, with similar obscuration in Halifax, Nova Scotia (82%), and St. John's, Newfoundland (82%).

No eclipse will be visible in Toronto. The point of maximum eclipse will be close to Akulivik, Nunavik, in northern Quebec, where a 91% eclipsed sunrise will be seen.

A gold sculpture of a person, known as the Tumaco-Tolita standing figure, was created between A.D. 1 to 300 near the Colombia-Ecuador border.

The figure is approximately 9 inches tall and has a flattened head, which may reflect the cultural practice of cranial vault modification.

The statue's feet are missing, but were once attached by gold wire, along with accessories and objects that it held in its hands.

A "fancy nose ornament" remains on the figure, indicating that it once donned a headdress on ritual occasions.

The Tumaco-Tolita civilization was known for their refined metalwork traditions in the Americas, and traded with other communities in the area between 200 B.C. and A.D. 400.

Remains of human and animal sculptures in metal and clay have been found throughout Tumaco-Tolita settlements and in their graves.

About 50% of people with serious mental illness are not receiving treatment, and it can be difficult to recognize when someone is struggling with their mental health.

Being kind and showing empathy towards someone who is suffering from a mental illness can make a huge difference in their recovery process. It's not about giving advice or trying to fix the problem; just being present and listening to them can help alleviate some of the stress and anxiety they're feeling.

People often don't know how to respond when someone tells them that they're struggling with their mental health, so it's essential to educate yourself on what you can do to support someone in this situation. This can be as simple as saying "I'm here for you" or "I care about you and I want to help."

It's also crucial to recognize the impact of societal stigma around mental illness. When people are struggling with their mental health, they often feel like they're alone and that no one understands what they're going through.

Jon is a husband and father who has been affected by his wife's struggles with depression. He describes how he tries to be more present for her and support her in any way possible, even if it means being patient and understanding when she needs space.

Jon's wife is starting a new job that will give her an extra day off per week, which Jon sees as a wonderful opportunity for her to relax and recharge. He believes that showing empathy and kindness towards someone who is struggling with their mental health can make all the difference in their recovery process.

Being kind to someone who is suffering from a mental illness doesn't have to be grand or complicated; it's often the small acts of kindness, such as having their lawn mowed for them, that can mean the most.

Jon emphasizes the importance of showing empathy and being kind towards people struggling with their mental health. He believes that these actions are not only essential for supporting individuals but also for creating a more compassionate society as a whole.

The burning of fossil fuels — coal, oil and gas — propelled humanity into the industrial revolution, remaking civilization in its wake.

Gasoline powers many of the cars we drive; coal and natural gas are central to global energy. But if aliens were building their own society, would they have to go down the same path as humanity, relying on fossil fuels to build their advanced civilization? Or could they find an alternative?

To build a modern civilization, aliens would likely need to use a source of energy that's just as abundant as fossil fuels, said Lewis Dartnell , an astrobiologist and author of " The Knowledge: How to Rebuild Our World from Scratch " (Penguin Press, 2014).

Dartnell drew a parallel with humans: In the 18th century, the world entered the industrial revolution by tapping into what appeared to be a limitless source of energy. Coal burned longer and produced more power than wood and charcoal.

The question of whether humans could have bypassed fossil fuels to reach alternative energy sources is "somewhat of a chicken-and-egg dilemma ," Dartnell told Live Science. For instance, producing solar panels requires silicon , and extracting and refining this element demands a significant amount of energy.

Scientists still haven't found a planet with abundant oxygen in its atmosphere, though trace amounts have been found on Mars, Venus and Jupiter's moon Europa. Oxygen is the key ingredient in burning fossil fuels because it enables combustion, which is what releases the energy stored in coal, oil and gas.

Fossil fuels are created from life — they're the transformed remains of plants and animals that lived hundreds of millions of years ago. Dartnell suggested that plate tectonics are a crucial part of the puzzle of how these life forms came to exist.

A 2022 study by researchers at the University of Sydney reported how Earth's tectonic plates move carbon between the deep Earth and the surface, forming what they call a "carbon conveyor belt." This process is key to maintaining Earth's "Goldilocks" climate, making the planet habitable, according to the study.

Put another way, plate tectonics can help pave the way for life and create conditions to help it become fossil fuels; it can also create ideal conditions for life that may become intelligent enough to harness those fuels.

Scientists have yet to find another planet with active plate tectonics . Nor have they found fossil fuels in space. What they have discovered, however, is evidence of fossil fuels' chemical building blocks: hydrogen and carbon.

Approximately 75% of the universe's mass is composed of hydrogen, said Shostak. Additionally, scientists have found a field of liquid hydrocarbons on Saturn's moon Titan . Intelligent aliens could, hypothetically, attempt to burn these elements to produce energy.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This summer, an intense marine heatwave struck off northwestern Australia, driving sea surface temperatures up to 4°C above the summer average.

The large mass of warm water has slowly moved south from the Kimberley region and through the Pilbara, leaving a wave of underwater destruction behind. Now Ningaloo Reef is bleaching in earnest.

Bleaching may also hit the World Heritage reef at Shark Bay in Western Australia.

The Great Barrier Reef is bleaching too in the waters from Cape York down to Townsville.

This appears to be the first time these two World Heritage-listed reefs have bleached in unison.

How bad is it? I have just returned from Ningaloo Reef, where I saw widespread bleaching and the first signs of coral mortality. Up to 90% of the coral found in shallow areas of the northern lagoon had bleached.

Bleaching doesn’t automatically mean death, but it severely weakens the coral and jeopardises survival.

At Ningaloo and further south, the heatwave is still unfolding. In coming months, we can expect to see some coral mortality, while other corals will survive the bleaching in poor health only to succumb to disease or other threats such as Drupella (coral-eating snails).

Other corals may survive but struggle to reproduce, but some particularly hardy corals with the right combination of genes for surviving this event are expected to live on.

Why is this happening? No surprises here: our greenhouse gas emissions trap more heat in the atmosphere. Over 90% of the heat pours into the oceans, pushing surface and deep water temperatures higher for longer periods of time.

Coral can tolerate brief periods of higher temperatures. But in response to prolonged heat stress, coral polyps expel their symbiotic zooxanthellae algae.

They appear to do this to avoid further tissue damage from toxic reactive oxygen molecules which build up as the coral begins to stress.

But these microalgae supply sugary food to the coral polyps in exchange for a home. Without these nutrients, the coral can starve.

Heat stress is tracked using a measure called “degree heating weeks” (DHW) – essentially, how much above-average heat has built up in an area over the previous three months.

Bleaching can begin at four DWH, while eight DHW can kill some corals.

At Ningaloo, the heat has been off the charts – levels of up to 16 DHW have been recorded, the highest on record for this location.

On the Great Barrier Reef, bleaching is underway in the northernmost section. This is the sixth bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef this decade.

Early data suggests there is severe heat in places, ranging from six to 13 DHW in intensity and alerts remain for more heat and bleaching to come.

Bleaching is usually worst for corals growing in shallow water, such as the calm lagoons created by fringing or barrier reefs.

Lagoons often have clear waters with high light penetration and limited flushing of water.

Ningaloo in hot water

Over ten days, we recorded the health and type of every coral we saw at 21 sites along Ningaloo Reef, from Coral Bay to the northern tip of North West Cape and into Exmouth Gulf.

The worst affected area that we observed was a 30 km stretch at the northern end of the North West Cape, the peninsula along which Ningaloo Reef runs. Here, we saw mass bleaching – up to 90% of corals had bleached.

We observed healthy and reproductive corals along the outer rim of the lagoon at Coral Bay, and locals have recently reported seeing spawning near Coral Bay.

This suggests some coral were indeed healthy enough to spawn.

What will happen next?

In just two months back in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump has tested the limits of the US Constitution, from overhauling immigration to drastically reducing the federal workforce and dismantling government agencies.

With Republicans now in control of both the Senate and House of Representatives, Congress has so far shown little sign it will stand in Trump’s way. The judiciary is the other branch of government that can check the power of the president. However, the Trump administration has appeared increasingly willing to simply ignore decisions handed down by judges.

There has also been a notable lack of unified opposition from the Democratic Party. Congressional Democrats are demoralised and deeply divided over how to respond to Trump. They face criticism, too, over their apparent lack of strategy. This has led some to ask why the United States lacks a formal political opposition leader.

In the American political system, the loser of the presidential election doesn’t retain a position as leader of the party in opposition. Instead, they tend to disappear from view. By contrast, in countries with Westminster-style parliamentary systems, such as Australia, the UK, Canada and India, the main party not in power selects an opposition leader from among their ranks.

During Trump’s first term, the Democratic speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, was widely recognised as the de facto Democratic opposition leader. A skilled negotiator, Pelosi was largely able to unite the Democrats behind her to lead the opposition to Trump’s legislative agenda.

As Senate majority and minority leader, Republican Senator Mitch McConnell successfully blocked swathes of legislation during Barack Obama’s presidency. He even thwarted a US Supreme Court nomination. In the 1980s, then-Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill led the Democratic opposition to Republican President Ronald Reagan’s domestic agenda, without resorting to obstructionism.

However, for an opposition figure to have this level of influence, they usually need decades of experience, political skill, and a party in control of the House or Senate. The Democrats no longer have a majority in either chamber and are no longer led by Pelosi. Hakeem Jeffries has been the House minority leader since 2023, but without the speaker’s gavel or control of any committees, he has limited influence.

Party discipline is typically far more unwieldy in the United States compared to other countries. In Australia, for instance, crossing the floor to vote against your own party is very rare. Unruly party caucuses make it significantly more difficult for a single party figurehead to emerge unless they command near-universal party loyalty and respect among their members in both chambers.

The Democratic caucus, already strained by Joe Biden’s late withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race, is now even more fractured. The Democrats continue to grapple with their resounding defeat in November, which saw the party lose ground with almost every demographic across the country. Polling shows public support for the Democrats has slumped to unprecedented lows.

Most dramatically, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer defied fellow Democrats (including Jeffries) by voting in favour of a resolution in recent weeks to avoid a government shutdown. His decision sparked an uproar from his party colleagues. Visual images of the party’s disarray were also on clear display during Trump’s joint address to Congress earlier this month.

While some representatives protested loudly, others followed leadership instruction to remain silent. Democrats were in near lock-step on almost all issues during Trump’s first term, as well as Biden’s presidency. Now, some are calling on Schumer to step aside as minority leader — and for the Democrats to coalesce behind a younger, more outspoken leader such as Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

In the fractious debates now consuming the party, some see parallels with the emergence of the Tea Party movement within the Republican Party during Barack Obama’s first term in office. Few expected a demoralised Democratic party to turn John Kerry’s heavy defeat to George W Bush in 2004 into a generational victory just four years later.

Similarly, after Obama decisively won reelection against Mitt Romney in 2012, few Republicans could have predicted they’d soon be back in power with Trump. But, as was the case 20 years ago, the soul-searching process will be painful for the Democrats. Whether it’s Ocasio-Cortez or another figure, the 2026 midterm elections are likely to be the best opportunity for a new central leader to emerge on the national stage.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/giving-rivers-room-to-move-how-rethinking-flood-management-can-benefit-people-and-nature-251225'>Giving rivers room to move: how rethinking flood management can benefit people and nature</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 01:22:11 <p>
When we think about flood management, higher stop banks, stronger levees and concrete barriers usually come to mind. But what if the best solution – for people and nature – isn’t to confine rivers, but to give them more space?

This alternative is increasingly being considered as an approach to mitigating flood risk.

Climate change is amplifying flood risks worldwide, and Aotearoa New Zealand is no exception. Large floods are expected to become much more frequent and severe, threatening communities, infrastructure and ecosystems.

Many of these risks are made worse by past management decisions that have artificially confined rivers within narrow channels, cutting them off from their natural floodplains.

Floodplain river systems have historically been dynamic, shifting across landscapes over time. But extensive stop banks, modification of river channels and land development have restricted this natural variability.

The idea of allowing rivers to reclaim space on their floodplains is not new.

In the Netherlands, the Room for the River programme was a response to flooding in 1995 that led to large-scale evacuations of people and cattle. In England, predictions that economic risks associated with flooding will increase 20-fold within this century ignited the Making Space for Water strategy.

A fundamental shift in river management involves acknowledging and accommodating natural variability.

Floodplain rivers are not static: they change across landscapes and through time, responding to seasonal flows, sediment movement and ecological processes.

Our research synthesises the ecological processes that are enabled when floodplain rivers have room to move.

Rivers that are not unnaturally confined are typically more physically complex. For instance, along with the main river channel, they might have smaller side channels, or areas where the water pools and slows, springs popping up from below ground to re-join the surface waters, or ponds on the floodplain.

A diverse range of habitats supports a rich variety of plant and animal life.

Biodiversity is not one-dimensional. Instead, it exists and operates at multiple scales, from a small floodplain pond to a whole river catchment or wider.

In a dynamic, ever-changing riverscape, we might find the genetic composition of a species varying in different parts of the river, or the same species of fish varying in their body size, depending on the habitat conditions.

These examples of natural biological variability enable species and ecosystems to be resilient in the face of uncertain future conditions.

At a larger scale, the type and number of species that live in different floodplain river habitats also varies.

This diversity of biological communities produces variation in the functions ecosystems perform across the river, such as the uptake of nutrients or processing of organic matter. This can even help to diversify food webs.

These variations mean not all species or groups of species in the river will be vulnerable to the same disturbances – such as droughts or floods – at the same time.

Some animals need multiple habitats within the river for different stages of life. Other creatures travel from afar to use river floodplains for only a short time.

The latter includes the banded dotterel (Charadrius bicinctus), endemic to Aotearoa New Zealand. This bird travels as far as 1,700km to nest on braided-river gravels each spring.

Banded dotterels are in decline, and they rely on habitats provided by rivers that have space to roam.

As climate change accelerates, we must rethink how we manage our waterways.

Reinforcing levees and deepening channels may seem like logical responses to increased flood risk, but these approaches often exacerbate long-term vulnerabilities and transfer risk elsewhere.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A team of researchers has developed a new algorithm that can optimize functions with high exponents, improving upon previous techniques.

 

The new algorithm, developed by Abraar Chaudhry, Yurii Nesterov, and Jason Altschuler, uses semidefinite programming to modify the Taylor expansion of a function, making it easier to minimize. This approach allows the algorithm to use arbitrarily many derivatives, enabling faster convergence on the true minimum.

 

The researchers' work builds upon previous breakthroughs in optimization, including Yurii Nesterov's demonstration of how to approximate functions with cubic equations using an arbitrary number of variables. However, their new algorithm can handle functions with higher exponents and is more efficient than existing methods.

 

The team's algorithm is based on the concept of "convex" functions, which have a single minimum value rather than multiple local minima. By modifying the Taylor expansion to be convex and a sum of squares, the researchers were able to develop an efficient method for minimizing high-exponent functions using Newton's method.

 

The new algorithm has several advantages over existing methods, including faster convergence rates and the ability to handle functions with arbitrarily many variables. However, each iteration is still computationally more expensive than gradient descent, making it less practical for certain applications.

 

Researchers are hopeful that as computational technology improves, the new algorithm could become a game-changer in fields such as machine learning and optimization.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

On March 5, Do No Harm sued the American Chemical Society for its Scholars Program.

The program provides financial support to chemistry students from underrepresented backgrounds.

A complaint argues the program is illegal because it is not open to White and Asian students.

Around two weeks later, Do No Harm also sued the University of Pennsylvania for its partnership with a database called the Black Doctors Directory.

The directory allows patients to find Black physicians.

The lawsuits join a recent uptick in legal action against universities, departments, and professional societies that host programs intended to increase diversity across academia.

In May 2024, White students at the University of Oklahoma sued their school, alleging the university discriminated against them by factoring in race when determining financial aid.

A conservative activist group sued the Department of Education over a program providing mentoring and research support to underrepresented students pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).

The loss of scholarships like the ACS Scholars Program would harm the scientific community, said Mindiola.

He's experienced this firsthand: The scholarship allowed him to focus on his lab research without having to take an outside job to sustain himself.

These programs are not discriminating, they're trying to give those races that have a historically low rate of participation a chance.

The Scholars Program has provided funding for around 3,500 students to support their studies in scientific fields.

With these lawsuits, "there are students who are currently enrolled, students who will be enrolled, who see themselves being attacked," said Matt Hartings.

The potential loss of these programs could have a detrimental effect on scientific research: If underrepresented scientists no longer have the resources to continue in their careers, the field might lose important role models and new ways of thinking.

Physicians of color are more likely to provide medical service in underserved areas.

Some recent research has suggested that racial concordance helps patients get better care and have more trust in the health care system.

The American Chemical Society is already changing language related to diversity, editing a headline on its website from "Advancing ACS' Core Value of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Respect" to "Advancing ACS' Core Value of Inclusion and Belonging."</p></b><br/><br/></div>
