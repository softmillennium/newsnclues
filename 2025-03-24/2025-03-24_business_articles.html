            For more than a month, President Donald Trump and his administration have been promoting April 2 as a kind of tariffs Super Bowl, during which all of his many promised import taxes will go into effect. But as he has demonstrated many times before, Trump once again appears to be offering a lot of hype and little action.
    


            Trump administration officials are trying to tamp down expectations that every pledged tariff action will go into effect April 2, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported this weekend. Instead, a significantly reduced batch of tariffs will be announced next week, and more could follow later, although both reports said the situation remains fluid and the ultimate decision could change.
    


            US stocks were higher Monday on the reports, as investors were relieved that the most punishing tariffs may not be coming as soon as many on Wall Street had feared. The Dow was up 530 points, or 1.27%. The broader S&P 500 rose 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2%.
    


            The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.32% as investors sold bonds in favor of riskier assets like stocks, reflecting easing concerns about the impact of Trump's tariffs. Yields and prices move in opposite directions.
    


            Wall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, slid 4.4% to its lowest level this month.
    


            Trump has repeatedly proclaimed next Wednesday to be “Liberation Day,” bringing massive reciprocal tariffs that match foreign countries' import taxes dollar for dollar. He was also set to enact twice-delayed 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada after briefly allowing them to go into effect earlier this month. And Trump had promised tariffs on a wide variety of goods imported from anywhere, including autos, pharmaceuticals, microchips, copper, lumber and other products.
    


            Now, it seems, those product-specific tariffs will not be enacted April 2, according to the Journal and Bloomberg. As for the 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods, it's unclear whether they will take effect or be further postponed.
    


            A White House official told CNN that no final decision have been made, and tariffs on various sectors and industries may or may not be announced April 2.
    


            Reciprocal tariffs will go into effect – perhaps as soon as April – but they will be limited to a dozen or so countries, Bloomberg and the Journal reported. The countries that first face the reciprocal tariffs will perhaps be the 15% of nations that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking on Fox Business last week, labeled “the Dirty 15” – countries that he says persistently treat the United States unfairly in their trading practices. Those trading partners could include Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia and Vietnam, according to the Journal.
    


            Although tariffs on those partners could cover the majority of goods coming into the United States, the more targeted approach nevertheless represents a significant pullback from some of the harshest tariffs Trump had promised.
    


            The administration has been setting the stage for a walkback for days. Trump in the Oval Office Friday hinted that his administration would allow for “flexibility” on tariffs – the first sign of potential exemptions after he had pledged there would be none.
    


            Trump still said he was hesitant to issue carve-outs on tariffs, but he has acknowledged in the past that tariffs enacted with a sledge hammer instead of a scalpel can at times inflict undue harm on Americans and US interests.
    


            “I don't change. But the word ‘flexibility' is an important word,” Trump said Friday. “So there'll be flexibility, but basically it's reciprocal,” he added, noting most tariffs will simply match foreign countries' taxes dollar for dollar with no carve-outs.
    


            Meanwhile, negotiations are ongoing. The EU last Thursday postponed its retaliatory tariffs, which were set to go into effect April 1, as talks continue. Mexico and Canada delayed plans to retaliate against US tariffs as officials negotiate.
    


            But Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs are giving investors, businesses, trading partners and consumers a serious dose of whiplash.
    


            We've been here before.
    


            Trump campaigned on steep tariffs on Day One, but he failed to deliver on that promise. Instead, he signed several executive actions on his first day in office ordering his administration to investigate whether to pursue tariffs on a wide range of goods. He did, however, announce that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico would be coming February 1.
    


            February 1 came, and, rather than the promised tariffs, Trump said the tariffs would come February 4. Then, on the eve of their taking effect, Trump announced monthlong delays on Canadian and Mexican tariffs after both countries sent delegations to negotiate, offering minor increases to existing border security and promises to take more action to restrict fentanyl crossing into the United States.
    


            Tariffs on China went into place February 4 – but not at the 60% level Trump had promised in December. The 10% tariffs came with a surprising twist: The elimination of the de minimis exclusion, a loophole that allows goods valued at less than $800 to come over the border duty-free. Those packages are numerous and onerous for customs officials to scan for tariffs.
    


            The next day, the US Postal Service stopped all package deliveries from China from entering the United States because it was unable to abide by the new trade policy. But hours later, the de minimis exclusion was back on – temporarily – until the Commerce Department could determine how to police it.
    


            Then, Trump promised a “big one,” as he called it: reciprocal tariffs.
    


            Instead, the plan, as it were, which Trump announced in the Oval Office on February 13 to much fanfare, consisted of a vaguely worded memo that offered few concrete details. Stocks surged that day as investors celebrated a tariff policy that appeared to be a lot of bark with no bite.
    


            On March 3, the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico went into effect – for three days. On March 6, Trump delayed all tariffs on its neighboring countries that comply with the USMCA trade agreement.
    


            On March 11, Trump threatened a 50% tariff on Canada's aluminum and steel but backed off the same day after Ontario agreed to suspend its 25% surcharge on electricity exports to Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The president has also threatened tariffs of up to 250% on Canadian dairy, reciprocal tariffs on Canadian lumber and 200% tariffs on European alcohol. It's unclear what the status of those threats is.
    


            Trump implemented tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum March 12, although they didn't represent a significant increase over what was already in place.
    


            The back and forth has created volatility on Wall Street, confusion for consumers and massive amounts of uncertainty for businesses, who are paralyzed by their inability to plan for what's next.

Tesla stock (TSLA) led gains among the "Magnificent Seven" on Monday, surging as much as 10% amid investor optimism that President Donald Trump's tariff plans may not be as wide-reaching as previously anticipated.

Read more about Tesla's stock moves and today's market action.

Reports that Trump will hold off on bringing in levies on the auto sector on April 2 eased worries that Tesla's bottom line would be impacted.

Shares of the EV maker had already been on a downward trend amid concerns of a drop in sales and a backlash against the brand over CEO Elon Musk's involvement in politics.

The stock began digging out of its most recent dip last week when Tesla revealed plans to launch its robotaxi service in 2025.

On Monday, the electric car maker responded to complaints about a pause in its Full Self-Driving trial in China, saying it will release the features once regulatory approval is secured.

Last Thursday, CEO Elon Musk held an impromptu company all-hands, giving an update on the progress of a number of products while also attempting to assuage fears that he wasn't ignoring his post.

The electric vehicle manufacturer's sales have slipped recently in key regions like Europe, China, and even the US.

As Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian recently reported, not only has the changeover to the new Model Y SUV been seen as a drag on sales, but Musk's closeness to President Trump and embrace of right-wing politics may be also impacting the brand.

Struggling chip giant Intel (INTC) could have a shot at future glory days.

But it's not guaranteed, and it won't be for a while, one analyst said.

"I think Intel has a much better shot of remaining viable in this industry [under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan]," Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen below). "It's not going to be easy — competition is not sitting still. Their competition, remember, is Nvidia. It's AMD. It's Arm Holdings. It's a Taiwan Semiconductor. It is Broadcom. It's Marvell."

Intel announced Tan as its next CEO on March 12. He officially began last week.

Tan was the CEO of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) from 2009 to 2021. After serving on Intel's board for two years, he left in August 2024 following clashes with now-ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger on how to position the business, a source told me.

The source said Tan was interviewed for the CEO role of Intel at the same time as Gelsinger. Gelsinger ultimately got the gig in 2021 but had to play nice by agreeing to put Tan on the board. Tan frequently pushed for a better artificial intelligence strategy to take on Nvidia (NVDA) and faster decision making at the notoriously bureaucratic Intel.

Listen: What Bill Gates thinks about Intel

The tech industry veteran has numerous challenges on his hands at the iconic American tech player.

Gelsinger led aggressive efforts to turn around the troubled US chipmaker for more than three years. He slashed thousands of jobs, improved costs, secured CHIPS Act funding, built chip foundries, and promised fast AI chips that could compete with Nvidia and AMD (AMD).

He was fired in early December amid missed targets and a cash drain on the foundry business.

Intel's fourth quarter sales fell 7% year over year to $14.3 billion, and net earnings plunged 76%. The company forecasts it will only break even on the profit line this year.

Tan must stabilize the business, likely through more cost cuts and new leadership, and regain trust with Wall Street.

 

Arya thinks Tan could look for partners to fund the expensive production of chips, a potential cash-saving strategy some on the Street have pushed Intel to consider. He upgraded his rating on Intel's stock to Neutral following Tan's appointment.

The stock is too cheap based on Intel's intellectual property, Arya added.

"So all we are saying is that the only value on Intel [right now] is just right the bricks and mortar of its fabs, right? Which is obviously not the case," Arya explained. "Now, should it really be valued as one of these growth companies? Obviously not. So I think what we were trying to say is that under his leadership, Intel has a better chance of adding [value] ... and getting recognized for its IP value because [Tan] comes from that background."

‘Barron's Roundtable' panelists discuss the latest headlines around 23andMe and share top stock picks.

Genetic testing company 23andMe filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to help the $50 million company sell itself, the company announced Sunday.

23andMe's saliva-based kits have been helping customers learn about their ancestry since 2006, and the company said it will continue operating while the bankruptcy court facilitates the sale process.

News of the move raised concerns about how the personal data of millions of 23andMe customers will be handled. 

California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued a "consumer alert" regarding the "trove of sensitive consumer data 23andMe has amassed," reminding Californians that they have the right to direct the company to delete their genetic data, destroy their test samples and revoke permission for genetic data to be used for research.

"There are no changes to the way the Company stores, manages, or protects customer data," 23andMe said in a media release. 

THIS IS WHAT NO ONE PLANNED COULD HAPPEN AFTER TAKING A DNA TEST

The company has experienced tumult in recent years. Last November, 23andMe said that it was cutting its headcount by 40%, or more than 200 employees. 

Co-founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki has resigned after multiple failed takeover bids, Reuters reports, but she said on X that she did it "so I can be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder."

Wojcicki will be replaced by CFO Joe Selsavage on an interim basis.

23andMe said it secured a debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing commitment for about $35 million and expects to continue operating during the sale process. It did not say if it had any other buyout interest or offers.

It listed both assets and estimated liabilities of $100 million to $500 million.

A month before its restructuring, 23andMe agreed to pay $30 million and give three years of security monitoring to settle a lawsuit accusing it of failing to protect the privacy of 6.9 million customers whose personal information was exposed in a data breach in 2023.

"We want to thank our employees for their dedication to 23andMe's mission," Mark Jensen, Chair and member of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors, said in a statement. "We are committed to supporting them as we move through the process."

English councils will be ranked according to their pothole fixing progress under government plans, with those who fail to publish updates losing out on millions in funding.

The Department for Transport (DfT) said local authorities' road maintenance pot would be boosted by £500m from mid-April, but councils must publish annual reports detailing progress on potholes or lose a quarter of that extra funding.

The prime minister told the BBC this would produce a rating system "so we know who is the best and who is not the best".

The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, said the government should focus on preventative measures rather than "reactively" fixing potholes.

Clearing the country's backlog of road repairs would take more than a decade and cost almost £17bn to fix, the LGA said, citing a survey from the Asphalt Industry Alliance.

According to data from the RAC, there are six potholes for every mile of road in England and Wales.

All English local authorities will get 75% of the extra cash promised, but if a council does not publish a report on road maintenance, including details on pothole filling progress, the remaining 25% will be withheld.

The held back funding will be given instead to councils the DfT believes have made proven progress.

The policy will only apply to English councils as funding for Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish local authorities is a devolved matter.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC a RAG (red, amber, green) rating system would be produced for councils on pothole maintenance.

He said that "until now, nobody has known how many potholes are being filled and where they're being filled".

"We all have the experience of driving from one place to the next and we know some places are better than others," he said, adding that the RAG system will help to avoid "the lottery that we have now".

However, Lucy Nethsingha, leader of Cambridgeshire County Council and chair of the LGA's Liberal Democrat group, said the amount of money was "nowhere near the amount that is needed".

"The implication that we are not spending it well is not helpful," she said, adding that the government was announcing "stuff that was already announced several times over and that doesn't help increase people's faith in politics".

"It's not clear that there is extra money coming as a result of this announcement. There is extra red tape and I don't think that's going to be helpful," she said.

She added in order to fix the roads in Cambridgeshire alone, the council had a shortfall £410m while the money the government was "re-announcing" for the whole of England was £500m.

"Our roads are like a worn out pair of trousers, you can keep fixing the holes, but what you actually need is a new pair of trousers - or in this case a proper resurfacing."

But the prime minister said "any council that says to me it's not enough money, I'd say come back to see me in June when you've actually filled these potholes in with your RAG rating and then we'll see if we can release more money to you". 

"Don't start the exercise complaining that you haven't got enough money."

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was "not pretending that the money we're making available will fill every pothole".

Asked whether withholding cash from some councils would just make things worse for drivers in some areas, she said she expected most local authorities would be able to "comply with these requirements".

"We want councils to be open and honest about how they are using that money so that the public can go onto their local council's website and see what action is being taken," she said.

Under the government's rules, councils must say how much they are spending, how many potholes have been filled and detail long-term road maintenance plans in reports that have to be published by the end of June.

By the end of October, councils must also demonstrate that communities have been consulted on where repairs should take place.

The DfT added that councils who "fail to meet these strict conditions" will see 25% of the funding withheld.

During the election campaign, Labour pledged to repair up to a million potholes a year in England.

The LGA said it was in "everyone's interests to ensure that public money is well spent". 

"This includes the government playing its full part by using the Spending Review to ensure that councils receive sufficient, long-term funding certainty, so they can focus their efforts on much more cost-effective, preventative measures rather than reactively fixing potholes, which is more expensive," it added.

Shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon described the government's announcement as a "pothole sticking plaster".

He said: "Labour like to talk a big game on fixing roads but they are more interested in chasing headlines."

The Liberal Democrats transport spokesman Paul Kohler called for a "more sustainable approach" to repairs, saying fixing individual potholes was welcome but did little to address a "crumbling road infrastructure".

Councils in the South East will have to publish reports on pothole repairs, or risk funding cuts.

A report by parliament's cross-party-transport select committee says accessibility failings are "systematic" across all modes of transport.

Thames Water is asked to pay compensation after a diversion through the village damages the road. 

Locals living near Weasenham Lane in Wisbech say the stretch is blighted by damaging potholes.

Kent County Council says it could be "much more proactive" if there was a change in the law.

Emanuel will become executive chairman of the newly-named WME Group, Mark Shapiro will lead it as president and managing director, while Whitesell exits to launch a new Silver Lake-backed venture.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


Endeavor is private once more, as the $25 billion deal by Silver Lake closed Monday morning.


	With the take-private complete, a slew of changes are in order. For starters, the newly-private businesses will go by WME Group, retiring the Endeavor name for public-facing purposes.




	Ari Emanuel, who founded Endeavor in 1995 and most recently served as CEO of the public venture, will shift to a new role as executive chairman.


	Mark Shapiro, who had been president and COO of Endeavor, will become president and managing partner, working in conjunction with Christian Muirhead and Richard Weitz, the WME co-chairs who will be co-chairmen of WME Group.

	And as widely expected, former Endeavor executive chairman Patrick Whitesell will exit to launch a new venture backed by Silver Lake that will “invest in and scale properties and IP across sports, media, and entertainment.” When the take-private was announced a year ago, it was noted that Whitesell's employment agreement included a provision for a new company backed by $250 million from Silver Lake.


	Emanuel will continue as chairman and CEO of TKO Group Holdings, the public company that owns UFC and WWE, and Shapiro will continue as president and COO of TKO.


	WME Group will include the WME agency, marketing firm 160over90, IMG licensing, and the unscripted studio Pantheon Media Group (formerly named Asylum Entertainment).


	“This remarkable moment— and the even more exciting future it launches—is thanks first and foremost to Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell, and to the relentless and ambitious strategic vision they have shared for more than twenty years to build Endeavor into a global powerhouse across talent, brands, and IP spanning entertainment, media, and sports,” Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban said in a statement, adding that his firm has never sold a share in the company. “Silver Lake is proud and honored to be their partners since 2012 as they have continued to build the company. Over this period, revenue has grown by twentyfold. Silver Lake has previously invested on six separate occasions to support Endeavor and now, with this latest investment, it is the single largest position in our global portfolio.”


	“Mark Shapiro is an impressive, hard charging, creative, and determined leader who is driving and orchestrating massive value creation,” he added. “We look forward to continuing our work and partnership with him and the rest of the management team — including Richard Weitz and Christian Muirhead at WME Group and Dana White, Andrew Schleimer, and the collective TKO leadership — all of whom are industry best.”

	











	“Our ability to deliver landmark partnerships, career-defining business opportunities, and enduring cultural moments is amplified by this transaction and the formation of WME Group,” Shapiro added. “The Silver Lake team has proven time and again that they are all-in on representation and content, and our clients, partners, and employees will thrive under our new structure.”


	“I am grateful to Egon and the team at Silver Lake for the trust they have placed in me as a founder and entrepreneur,” Emanuel added. “Together, we have created and enhanced a foundation unlike any other to accelerate value creation for clients and partners across WME Group and TKO, which I am excited to continue to build and grow.”


	“Everything we built at Endeavor would not have been possible without the partnership of Egon and the entire Silver Lake team,” Whitesell said. “Our industry is in the very early stages of generational transformation. I have never seen a more promising time for bold and ambitious entrepreneurs, creatives, and athletes.”


	“Silver Lake is enormously pleased and energized to partner and invest with Patrick in support of his new platform,” Durban added of the Whitesell venture.

The University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD) has officially opened The Innovation Matrix, a cutting-edge 2,200 sq. m facility in Swansea's SA1 Waterfront.

Designed to drive digital innovation, entrepreneurship, and industry collaboration, the new space is situated alongside the university's existing IQ and Y Fforwm buildings. It has already attracted nine businesses to its high-quality working spaces, creating a dynamic cluster with the added benefit of direct access to UWTSD's expertise and research.

Funded through a strategic partnership between UWTSD and the Swansea Bay City Deal, the Innovation Matrix offers an opportunity for established businesses and dynamic start-ups to accelerate new product development, access specialist technical support, hire graduate talent and create knowledge exchange partnerships with the university.

The building was developed by Kier Construction, which secured £6 million worth of contracts for Wales-based businesses during the construction process.

The launch event was attended by representatives of the Welsh and UK governments, civic leaders, and industry partners, including:

Dame Nia Griffith, MP, said:

“It's great that UK Government funding, through the Swansea Bay City Deal, has contributed to building this wonderful facility. Our key mission, as set out in our Plan for Change, is economic growth.

 

“The Innovation Matrix will provide space for established businesses to grow and new businesses to start up, creating jobs in the high-tech industries of the future.”

Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Energy and Planning, Rebecca Evans, said: 

“We want Wales to be at the forefront of innovating new technologies that drive meaningful change in society and benefit people in their day-to-day lives.

 

“This exciting development will nurture a first-class ecosystem for digital innovation and enterprise that can be a catalyst for economic growth and prosperity.

 

“It is a testament to the excellence partnership working can deliver for regional economies in Wales and is another step forward on our journey to a stronger, fairer, greener future.”

Among the companies who have already taken up residence at the Innovation Matrix are:

Professor Elwen Evans, KC, Vice-Chancellor of UWTSD said: 

“The opening of this new building marks a significant step in digital innovation, providing a unique opportunity to collaborate, co-locate, and thrive in a high-quality space designed for partnership working. By bringing together industry and education, we are fostering an environment where cutting-edge ideas can develop, talent can flourish, and innovation can drive economic growth.”

Cllr Rob Stewart said: 

“Swansea has a proud history for innovation and entrepreneurship, but there has been a shortage in recent years of high-quality offices and shared workspace environments to meet the needs of businesspeople and aspiring entrepreneurs.

 

“Supported by cutting-edge digital connectivity, the Innovation Matrix will complement several other projects in Swansea to help meet that need while also giving access to university expertise and research.

 

“It will support existing businesses, give start-up businesses an opportunity to thrive and help create jobs for local people.

 

“The Innovation Matrix will also combine with other developments like the 71/72 Kingsway office scheme to further reinforce Swansea's reputation as a city of business and investment.”

Nearly a quarter million Segway scooters are being recalled due to safety hazards, according to officials.

The recall was announced by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) on Thursday. The recall pertains to all 220,000 units of the Segway Ninebot Max G30P and Max G30LP KickScooters.

According to the CPSC, the recall was issued due to the models' folding mechanism, which may be faulty.

"The folding mechanism can fail and cause the handlebars or stem to fold while the scooter is in use, posing a fall hazard to consumers," the notice said.

As of Thursday, Segway has received 68 reports of folding mechanism failures. These caused around 20 injuries, ranging from abrasions and bruises to "lacerations and broken bones."

Segway advises owners of the recalled scooters to "immediately" stop using them.

"Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled scooters and contact Segway to receive information to determine whether the folding mechanism needs adjustment and to receive a free maintenance kit," the recall notice said.

"The kit includes tools and instructions for checking and tightening the folding mechanism and keeping it properly maintained."

The CPSC also noted that the vehicles, which were manufactured in China and Malaysia, sold for between $600 and $1,000 from Jan. 2020 to Feb. 2025. Consumers could have purchased the devices at Best Buy, Costco, Walmart, Target and Sam's Club, as well as Segway.com and Amazon.com.

The CPSC also included physical descriptions of the scooters, in case Segway owners aren't sure if they own the recalled models.

Landlords are left with no choice to offset looming tax rises introduced by the chancellor, says trade body

Londoners might not bat an eyelid at paying £5 for a pint but the national average is poised to rise above that watermark for the first time, with publicans blaming tax rises introduced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.

The sobering milestone is likely to be reached next month, according to research by Frontier Economics, with the average price of a pint of beer on course to hit £5.01, up from £4.80.

The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), which commissioned the research, said landlords had been left with no choice but to raise prices to offset tax rises that are due to come into force in April.

Pubs will face greater overheads due to an increase in the national minimum wage, a rise in national insurance rates and a decrease in the threshold at which they start paying out national insurance.

Discounts on business rates paid by hospitality firms will also be cut from 75% to 40% from April.

The net cost to the pubs sector of these measures, introduced in last October's budget, will hit £650m in total, the trade body said. Last week the brewer Shepherd Neame, maker of ales including Spitfire and Bishops Finger, said it would raise its beer prices in response to rising taxes.

Emma McClarkin, the chief executive of the BBPA, said: “The cumulative impact of these taxes and regulations is now plain to see and it is highly unfortunate that the only way many pubs can remain viable is to pass on the array of upcoming costs to consumers.

“No one wants to see the cost of an average pint increase by a further 21p and break the £5 average pint barrier that will be required for pubs to maintain their punishingly slim profit margins.”

Pubs and the wider hospitality sector have struggled to recover from the impact of enforced closures during the Covid-19 pandemic, which left many with crippling debt burdens. The sector's budding recovery was then hampered by inflation and the accompanying cost of living crisis.

The number of pubs fell below 39,000 for the first time in December 2024 after hundreds of closures, according to the property data company Altus Group.

“It is more urgent than ever that government looks at ways to cap or reduce the costs of doing business so we can keep pubs open, preserve their community value and make sure the price of a pint remains affordable for all,” said McClarkin.</p>
