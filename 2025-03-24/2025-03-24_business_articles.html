Jocko Willink, former commander of the Navy Seals Team 3 task unit Bruiser, has injected his unit with the motto "Discipline Equals Freedom."

This means that by creating and following established procedures and guidelines, you can concentrate on the mission in front of you without being bogged down by unnecessary steps.

Willink's book, Discipline Equals Freedom: Field Manual, is a compilation of the ideas and routines he has introduced in his co-founder, leadership consulting firm Echelon Front, and his popular podcasts.

In an interview with Business Insider, Willink shared two things he does the night before to get up and start acting quickly.

Gym clothes ready for the morning

At 4:30am, Willink wakes up and heads to the gym he built in his garage. He said that even if it's not the menu featured in Field Manual, they should do some kind of exercise.

"It doesn't matter if you're walking around the neighborhood, jogging, healthy exercises, weight training, swimming, or anything else," he said.

"But we need to do something to promote blood circulation and switch our minds towards what we need to do."

To make exercise a habit, Willink said it's essential to have exercise clothes ready the night before so that you can wear them the moment you leave bed in the morning.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Costco is trying to stop non-members from using food courts.

The rules are the same in the first place, but some stores have not been thorough.

This is part of Costco's efforts to limit non-member access to stores.

Costco's food court, popular for its $1.50 hot dog and drink set, has attracted Costco members and non-members alike.

And now, Costco is trying to stop non-members from using food courts.

A Reddit user posted a photo of a "announcement" posted at Costco in Orlando, Florida, USA, with the words "From April 8, 2024, you will need a Costco membership card to purchase items from the food court."

Four stores in the United States told Business Insider that they had been instructed to check membership cards for customers using food courts.

One employee in the management department of a store in Chicago, Illinois told Business Insider that the rules were implemented more strictly than before, with a letter sent to members in December 2023 and a "announcement" was posted outside the store.

ファイナンシャルプランを立てる際、インフレは頭に入れておかなくてはならない。 Drazen Zigic/Shutterstock

インフレが資産にどのような影響を与えるか不安に感じていた私は、ファイナンシャルプランナーに聞いてみた。

まずは現金の確認頻度を増やし、必要なら支出を削減するようアドバイスを受けた。

また、いますぐ余剰現金をため込むのをやめ、高金利負債を返済しなければならない。

最近、会話中の登場頻度が増えた気がするのが、インフレーションという金融用語だ。インフレなど各種要因でレストランのメニューが値上げされると聞けば、夕食時にインフレが話題になる。むろん、食料品店やガソリンスタンド、小売店で価格を見て回るときも然りだ。

インフレが盛んに話題に出るようになったので、自分のパーソナルファイナンスや投資について考えるべきことなのかと思い始めた。もしそうなら、何をどのように始めるべきだろうか？

「計画を立てる際、絶対に頭に入れておかなければならないのがインフレだ。インフレは、資産や元本、購買力を蝕むためステルス税と言われる」とファイナンシャルプランナーのエリック・ブロットマン氏は言う。

「厄介なのは、今のようなインフレは何年も起こっていないことだ。つまり、インフレを経験していない世代が誕生している」

そこで私は複数のファイナンシャル・アドバイザーに、インフレ時代に現金をどうしたらよいかアドバイスを求めることにした。

1. 資産の確認頻度を増やす

私は毎週資産を必ずチェックするが、ファイナンシャルプランナーのマリニー・デ・モーリアック氏は、インフレは入れ違いで資産に影響を与えることがあるので、予算アプリを注視するようにと言う。

「すべての品目が同じペースで値上がりするわけではない。キャッシュ・フローを定期的に見直すことが欠かせない」とデ・モーリアック氏は言う。

「月に1度日付を設定し、カレンダーに入れておこう。いくら入ってきて、何に支出するか確認しておきたい。例えば、ガソリン価格の上昇が激しく、自動車通勤でガソリン代がかさんでいるなら、支出超過を避けるため他の品目への支払いを減らさなければならないだろう。そうした取り組みはすぐに効果が出なくても、時間が経つにつれて塵も積もれば山となる」

2. 現金保有額を見直す

私は多額の現金を高金利預金に入れているが、ブロットマン氏は間違った判断だという。インフレは資産形成の阻害要因だと認識することが大事だ。

ブロットマン氏は言う。

「現金価値の上昇ペースが財やサービス価格の上昇に追い付かないため、現金に対するリターンは実質的にマイナスになる。（インフレになれば）現金はもはや富の形成に役立つ資産ではない。緊急時や流動性確保のために現金は持っておくべきだが、現金価値は下落し続ける。いまこそ余剰現金を別の資産クラスに分散させる時かもしれない」

3. 借金から抜け出す

インフレはさまざまな形で個人資産に打撃を与えるが、その1つが負債への影響だ。ファイナンシャルプランナーのジェイ・ジグモント氏は、インフレの時には借金返済に注力することが大事、と説く。

ジグモント氏は言う。

「インフレと金利上昇のダブルパンチは、多くの人たちにとって失う部分が増えるということだ。クレジットカードの平均金利も上がるだろう。金利上昇はすべての価格を押し上げるので、借入残高と毎月の最低返済額がどちらも増加する」

ジグモント氏は、これ以上新たな借金をしないようにクレジットカード利用の停止を勧める。

「借金返済を進めるつもりなら、新たに借りるのはやめなければならない。そして、できるだけ早く借金を返済する目標を立てよう」

4. 所得を増やそう

「インフレでライフスタイルや予算が劇的に変わりつつあるなら、キャッシュ・フローの見直しだけでなく、財やサービス価格の上昇を賄うために所得を増やす方法を考えよう」とデ・モーリアック氏は言う。

「2つ目のアルバイトを見つける、副業を始める、スキルアップやキャリアチェンジを図る、昇進や昇給を交渉する、新しい仕事の機会を模索することかもしれない。事業主ならば、サービスの品ぞろえや請求体系を見直して、所得増加の新たな機会を見つけると良いだろう」

5. 債券投資を再考する

投資ポートフォリオをチェックする時には、インフレ上昇期に最も影響を受ける負債証券（債券、現金、譲渡性預金［CD］など）を注視すべきと、ファイナンシャルプランナーのヘイリー・エリスは言う。

トリツキー氏は言う。

「金利が上昇すると、表面利率が高い債券が発行されるため、既存の債券価格が下落する。投資ポートフォリオに債券を組み入れているならば、運用期間の投資手法が保守的になり過ぎないよう留意しよう。金利変動に敏感な長期債ではなく、短中期債を検討した方が良い。反対に株式は、景気変動に伴い短期的に価格が変動するかもしれないが、長い目で見ればインフレをはるかに上回るペースで上昇する傾向にある」

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.businessinsider.jp/article/277692e/'>The strong organization is "No. 2" incredible. Five characteristics of good managers that are actually more important than leaders</a></h2><b>Source:</b> businessinsider&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 17:00:00 <p>

日本に限らず、「1人のリーダーが世の中を変えてくれるのではないか」という願望は根強いものがあります。

政治でも企業でも、分かりやすく方向を示してくれるカリスマ的なリーダーが現れて、この状況から私たちを救い出してくれるのではないか——いわゆる「リーダー待望論」です。特に不況期や変化が必要な時の閉塞感を打ち破るには、強いリーダーが求められます。

しかし、本当にリーダー1人で、大きく状況を変えられるのでしょうか？

ムーブメントを起こすのは誰か

2010年に開催されたTEDに、おもしろいプレゼンテーションがあります。デレク・シヴァーズ氏の「社会運動はどうやって起こすか」です。話題になったプレゼンなので、ご覧になった方も多いかもしれません。

ご存じない方のために概略を説明しましょう。

シヴァーズ氏は、3分ほどの映像を見せながらプレゼンを始めます。

芝生の斜面に大勢の人が座っています。すると突然、上半身裸の男性1人がおかしな踊りを始めます。最初は彼1人ですが、しばらくすると別の男性が一緒になって踊り出します。それを見ていた1人が踊りの輪に加わって、これで3人になりました。

やがて数人のグループが合流。これをきっかけにして我も我もと人々が踊りに加わっていきます。いわゆるティッピング・ポイント（物事が急激に変化する点のこと）を超えたのです。

もはや踊りに加わることは、変なことではなくなりました。ここまで参加者が増えると、むしろ踊りに加わらない方が恥ずかしくなり、ますます参加者が増えていきます。たった3分ほどの動画ですが、ここにはムーブメントがどのように広がっていくのかのエッセンスが凝縮されています。

動画が終わると、シヴァーズ氏は次のように語ります。

「この運動が始まったきっかけは、上半身裸の1人の男が変な踊りを始めたからです。それは事実です。 しかし、そもそも1人ではリーダーではありません。このきっかけが大きな運動になったのは、2人目、3人目のフォロワーがいたからです。1人の変人をリーダーに変えたのは、2人目、3人目のフォロワーなのです。彼らがいなければ運動が起きることはありませんでした。 しかし、いつも評価されるのはリーダーだけだったりします。つまりリーダーは過大評価されているのです」

これは社会的なムーブメントに限ったことではありません。ビジネスでもNo.2の重要性を示す例はあります。ホンダの創業者で技術屋だった本田宗一郎氏と、それを経営面から支えた藤沢武夫氏は非常に有名なコンビです。ソニー創業者の井深大氏と盛田昭夫氏もしかりです。

ビジネスの世界でいうところのNo.2、No.3は、いわゆる「マネジャー」と呼ばれる人たちです。強い組織をつくるうえで、もしかしたらリーダー以上に重要なカギを握るのがこの「2人目、3番目のフォロワー」なのです。

そこで今回は、「2人目、3番目のフォロワー」たるマネジャーとはどんな人材なのか、どうすればそんなマネジャーになれるのかについてお話しすることにします。

リーダーシップとどう違う？

世に「マネジャー」と呼ばれる人は数多く存在します。厚生労働省の就業構造基本調査では、従業員100名以上の企業で管理職は20〜30万人と推計されています。同じく賃金構造基本統計調査では、実にその10倍の300万人と推計されています。かなり開きがありますが、いずれにせよかなり多くのマネジャーがいることは間違いありません。

これほど多くのマネジャーがいるのに、若い人たちと話していても「マネジャーになりたい」という声はあまり聞こえてきません。私の私見に満ちたイメージですが、マネジャーよりも「リーダー」という言葉のほうが響きがよく、またヒーロー／ヒロインとして注目されやすいので、憧れの対象になりやすいのではないでしょうか。

ではここで質問です。そもそもリーダーに必要な「リーダーシップ」と、マネジャーに必要な「マネジメントスキル」。あなたは両者の違いを説明できますか？ 本題に入る前に、まずはこのポイントを押さえておきましょう。

「リーダーシップ」は古代ギリシャから存在した

「リーダーシップ」という言葉が生まれたのは、古代ギリシャ時代にまで遡ります。リーダーシップとは生まれながらに備わった先天的なもの、というのが近代までの定説でした。

ところが1960年代から70年代の後半にかけて、学者のジョン・アデアがその常識を覆します。リーダーシップは訓練と経験によって「後天的に誰もが身に付けられる」と主張し、「リーダーの7つの実践行動」を提示しました。

ドラッカーが生み出した「マネジメント」

一方の「マネジメント」は、経営学の大家として日本でもよく知られるピーター・ドラッカーが生み出した概念だと言われています。ドラッカーは、『現代の経営」（1954年刊）や『マネジメント』（1973年刊）といった著書の中で、マネジメントを「組織に成果を挙げさせるための道具、機能、機関」と定義し、マネジメントを担う「マネジャーの5つの仕事」を提示しました。

ドラッカーの「マネジャーの5つの仕事」と前述したアデアの「リーダーの7つの実践行動」を比較すると、両者には多くの類似点があることが分かります（下図）。

筆者作成

つまりこういうことです。20世紀中盤まではリーダーシップという概念しかなく、しかもリーダーシップは「生まれながらの資質に基づくもの」と考えられていた。しかし20世紀後半になると、ドラッカーが「マネジメント」という概念を生み出し、アデアは「リーダーシップは後天的に習得できる」と従来の常識を覆した——。

マネジメントとリーダーシップに類似点が多いのはこのためです。ビジネスの場面では、ほぼ同じものだと言ってよいでしょう。

マネジャーはなぜ過小評価されるのか

次に、リーダーシップとマネジメントを具体的に実行する人、「リーダー」と「マネジャー」についても比較してみましょう。

リーダーとは多くの場合、リーダーシップを発揮する人という意味で使われます。ビジョンを描いて人々を導いていくイメージから、「リーダー」という言葉にはポジティブなイメージがありますね。

では、一方のマネジャーはどうでしょうか。マネジメントは「経営」「管理」などと訳されますが、マネジャーは多くの場合「管理職」と訳されます。そのせいか、マネジャーは「管理（だけ）する人」、つまり自分自身は行動せずにメンバーの行動を管理している人だというイメージを持っている人が多いようです。

このように、「マネジメント」と「リーダーシップ」は類似の行動をすると定義されているにもかかわらず、それらを実行する「マネジャー」と「リーダー」では想起されるイメージが違います。

本来ならばリーダーと同様に評価されていいはずのマネジャーが、「管理だけをする人」と過小評価されてしまっていることが、おそらくマネジャーの人気を下げている一因なのでしょう。

年功序列や成果主義でマネジャーにしてはいけない

「マネジャーが過小評価されている」と書きましたが、世の中を見回せば、たしかに過小評価されて当然の「イケてないマネジャー」がたくさんいるのも事実です。

「イケてないマネジャー」が量産される原因は何なのでしょうか？ 本人に原因がある場合もありますが、会社（経営者）に原因があることも少なくありません。典型的なのは次のようなパターンです。

経験年数が長い人をマネジャーにする

業績を上げた人をマネジャーにする

年功序列や成果主義でマネジャーにする、というのは多くの日本企業で行われてきたことです。今まではこれでうまく回ってきたかもしれませんが、このような人たちをマネジャーにすることで、近年では組織にほころびが出てきています。</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Non-executive directors of UK companies are bracing for a wave of takeover bids in 2025 due to share price weakness.

As many as 80 per cent of non-executive directors said their companies are more vulnerable to a takeover bid, according to data from investment bank Peel Hunt.


Last year, significant UK companies were taken over, including the £5.7bn merger of DS Smith and US rival International Paper, and Hargreaves Lansdown’s £5.4bn sale.

Other multibillion-pound deals included a US private equity firm's £4.3bn takeover of Darktrace and Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky's £3.6bn swoop for Royal Mail owner IDS.


92 per cent of non-executive directors told Peel Hunt they were expecting an increase in takeovers of UK companies this year.

A majority attributed the expected rise to share price weakness and UK public market undervaluation, with two thirds strongly agreeing that the factors affected their companies.

Only 15 per cent said they could confidently assess shareholder appetite for an offer if their firm faced a takeover bid.


The current challenges facing UK equity markets are having an enduring impact on UK plc share prices, making them more vulnerable to takeovers.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Edwardians: Age of Elegance will explore the lives and tastes of two of Britain’s most fashionable royal couples – King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, and King George V and Queen Mary – from their family lives and personal collecting to their glittering social circles, global travels and spectacular royal events.

The exhibition will bring together more than 300 items – almost half on display for the first time – including fashion, jewellery, paintings, photographs, books, sculpture and ceramics. Visitors will see works from the Royal Collection by many of the period’s most celebrated names.

Curator Kathryn Jones said: ‘The Edwardian era is seen as a golden age of style and glamour, which indeed it was, but there is so much more to discover beneath the surface.’ This was a period of transition, with Britain poised on the brink of the modern age and Europe edging towards war.

In 1863, Queen Victoria’s eldest son Albert Edward married Princess Alexandra of Denmark. The marriage ushered in a glamorous new era for the royal family. With Queen Victoria still in mourning, Edward and Alexandra established their own vibrant court, filled with contemporary art, opulent balls and society events – a lifestyle later continued by their son, the future King George V, and his wife Queen Mary.

The two couples were famous for their style, with Alexandra named by Vogue as ‘the legitimate head of fashion throughout the British dominions’. Visitors will see examples of Alexandra and Mary’s dazzling jewellery. Alongside these, paintings of magnificent court events by Laurits Tuxen and portraits by the most fashionable society painters of the day, including Philip de László and John Singer Sargent, will capture the era’s spectacular fashions.

Displays will evoke the fashionably cluttered interiors of the royal couples’ private residences at Marlborough House and Sandringham House. Examples will include a Cartier crystal pencil case set with diamonds and rubies, on show for the first time, and more than 20 items by the Russian jeweller Fabergé.

Edward and Alexandra surrounded themselves with fashionable society figures – known as the ‘Marlborough House Set’ – and their lives were filled with glitz and glamour. They travelled further than any royals before them, collecting objects, receiving gifts, and employing tour artists and photographers.

The royal family also embraced the new medium of photography, both as an art form and to capture the world around them. Visitors will see works by famed photographers of the era, including Mary Steen and Alice Hughes – as well as photographs taken by Alexandra, using portable Kodak cameras to capture official events and family moments.

Edward founded the Order of Merit in 1902 to recognise contributions to cultural, scientific or military life. Recipients included Sir Edward Elgar and the physicist Sir J J Thomson, and a portrait of each was drawn for the King.

The royal family collected works that recorded and honoured the sacrifices made by so many during World War I and its aftermath. By the end of the conflict, a more restrained and dutiful monarchy had emerged: a monarchy shaped for the 20th century.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Former City traders convicted as part of the rate-rigging scandal are playing their last remaining card by taking their case to the Supreme Court.

The scandal arose in 2012 when banks were discovered to be falsely inflating or deflating their rates.


In August 2015, former UBS and Citigroup trader Tom Hayes was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud by 'rigging' the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR).


Former Barclays trader Carlo Palombo was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud by rigging the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) in March 2019.


The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) investigated and prosecuted both men and others in the EURIBOR case.


Hayes was sentenced to 11 years in prison, and was released after five and a half years, while Palombo served four years.


The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) referred the case to the Court of Appeal, concluding there was a 'real possibility' the Court would conclude their convictions were unsafe.


This decision came after a ruling by the US Appeal Court regarding the definition and proper operation of LIBOR and EURIBOR.


However, the Court of Appeal upheld Hayes and Palombo's convictions last March.


The Court of Appeal rejected the men's application to appeal to the Supreme Court, so they had to go to the Court directly.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.cityam.com/boiling-point-a-one-shot-restaurant-drama-that-makes-you-stand-the-heat/'>Adolescence fans are watching Stephen Graham's Boiling Point</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cityam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 14:45:41 <p>
Adolescence fans are discovering Stephen Graham drama Boiling Point, which was shot in one take without cutting.

Now that everyone’s talking about Adolescence on Netflix, I’d like to recommend Stephen Graham and Philip Barantini’s previous project, Boiling Point (2021).

An unbearably tense one-shot drama thriller set in the kitchen of a prestigious restaurant. Don’t miss it!

Stephen Graham has done the one shot thing before adolescence too – in this brilliant film called Boiling Point.

Found out the director of boiling point is the one behind that new netflix series adolescence consider it shot up to the top of my watchlist.

The ‘one-shot’ movie has become more prevalent over the years, as digital film has made the process less technically fraught.

While the most famous examples have some trickery (Birdman and Hitchcock’s Rope had hidden edits), many filmmakers have taken on the arduous task of filming an entire movie in one take.

The latest is British filmmaker Philip Barantini with Boiling Point, a drama where the camera follows the action continuously for 93 agonising minutes.

Stephen Graham stars as Andy, a well-respected but confrontational head chef at a London restaurant.

After a tough personal conversation, he walks into the kitchen for what will be the most difficult night of his career.

He’s just been downgraded by the health inspector, almost every dish is running low, his right-hand woman Carly (Vinette Robinson) is on the brink of quitting… and the doors haven’t even opened yet.

As the evening goes on, Andy tries to juggle the mounting pressures that threaten to ruin him.

The smarmy, patronising tones of the health inspector are enough to make your skin crawl, but it turns out to be the tip of an anxiety iceberg.

Everywhere the camera goes, there seems to be a new issue exploding or a new character to dislike – a racist patron, a demanding food blogger, not to mention Andy’s former boss, celebrity chef Alastair Skye (Jason Flemyng) making a surprise appearance.

Anyone who doubted the stress of the service industry is thrown headfirst into a warzone, where the well-intentioned clash with the entitled, and everyone seems to be pulling in different directions.

This is not to say Barantini creates an us vs them atmosphere. Everyone in Boiling Point has a story, and a breaking point, glimpsed in beautifully captured moments such as an embattled manager calling her father from the loo, or a pastry chef fighting back the tears after discovering something about a colleague.

It’s perfect chaos, a story that shows the struggle of just getting through a shift. The camera work is deceptively simple, moving elegantly back and forth from dining room to kitchen, while also managing the shifts in tone.

More impressive than the technical prowess are the performances found in every corner. Outside of the lead, Robinson’s Carly is magnificent, revealing a person teetering on the edge of resignation as she chooses between her loyalty to Andy and a new opportunity.

Flemyng is the perfect fly in the ointment, poking at Andy’s insecurities while nursing a secret of his own.

Exchanges come thick and fast, but everyone makes it count – none more so than Graham. It would be easy to do a Gordon Ramsey impression, but Andy is something different. 

Coming into the story as a ball of rage, calling everyone ‘love’ or ‘soft lad’, the bravado crumbles as he realises the mess he’s in.

Like a boxer who knows the next punch might flatten him, Graham swerves and bargains his way through each problem, confusion and fear building behind his eyes. 

It’s remarkable to watch, if a bit stressful.

The trouble with constantly building the stakes is that you risk going too far.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Spring Statement will not "alter the basics" of public spending plans, Sir Keir Starmer has insisted.

The Prime Minister said he wanted to "take some money out of government" and that his ministers were "looking across the board" at spending.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves will deliver the Spring Statement to the Commons on Wednesday, when she is expected to announce spending cuts for some government departments.

A new YouGov survey found 80 per cent of Brits believe the public finances are in a poor state, including 34 per cent who say they are in a "very bad" state.

The Prime Minister said his government was "looking across the board" at spending and would not undo investments made last year.

He insisted: "We're not going to alter the basics, but we are going to look across and one of the areas that we will be looking at is, can we run the government more efficiently?"

The Prime Minister mentioned artificial intelligence (AI) and technology as examples of how government efficiency could be improved.

He added: "Some of the examples I've been given are in the NHS – a stethoscope and AI, working together can predict pretty accurately if you're 60 years or over, whether you're going to have a heart problem."

The Prime Minister said AI could be used for organising waiting lists and identifying people likely to miss appointments.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed plans to cut costs by 15 per cent by 2030.

Reeves also told broadcasters that the digital services tax is "hugely important" and brings in around £800m a year.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

For periodic investing, you can put a fixed amount aside every month in an index fund.

The advantage is that you are automatically remedied between periods in which stock prices are high or low.

Beurs expert Hendrik Oude Nijhuis shows that this can produce surprising results.

Analysis = an attractive way of investing is periodic investing, for example with income that you can set aside every month. 

Periodic investing ensures that you automatically agree between periods in which stock prices are high or lower. 

Since you always invest a fixed amount per month, you buy fewer shares when the rates are high and more when the rates are low.

Suppose you invest 240 euros in an index fund every month. 

And suppose three scenarios such as below. The price scenarios for a period of five months are extreme, but that is to make clear the benefits of periodic investing. 

If you take into account a longer investment horizon of, for example, ten years, then the scenarios below are not even so extremely.

Three scenarios for periodic investing

In Scenario A there is successive the following five rates: 20 euros, 40 euros, 40 euros, 60 euros and 60 euros. 

Many investors see this as an ideal scenario: races that rise or at least do not fall.

Because you invest 240 euros every month, you can buy twelve shares in this scenario in the first month, six shares in the second month, and so on after five months you have 32 shares.

In Scenario B the price jumps firmly up and down and at the end of the period it is only half of that of Scenario A. 

The price trend in scenario B is as follows: 20 euros, 30 euros, 20 euros, 10 euros and 30 euros.

Scenario C is the disaster scenario. Imagine to have started investing just before the attacks of September 11, 2001 or at the start of the pandemic. 

In this scenario, the course at the end of the period is just back. The price development in Scenario C: 20 euros, 10 euros, 5 euros, 10 euros and 20 euros.

In Scenario A you had bought 32 shares during the five months. 

At the end of the period the rate is 60 euros so together they are good for 1,920 euros.

In the Volatile Scenario B you could have purchased 64 shares, the double number compared to Scenario A. 

Since the price at the end of the period is now 30 euros (half of that of Scenario A) your investment is also worth 1,920 euros in this case.

In Scenario C, the disaster scenario, you could have purchased 120 shares in the five months. 

And at the rate of 20 euros these are good for 2,400 euros, or most of all.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Editor’s Interview: Charles Tyrwhitt founder – ‘No point whinging about the government’

The founder of Charles Tyrwhitt, Nick Wheeler, has told City AM that there’s “no point whinging about what the government are doing or not doing, because they’re not going to change,” adding “I’ve got to get on and make my own decisions.”

His comments came during an interview with City AM in which he lamented the lack of business experience among politicians. The storied shirt maker said “politicians very rarely come from a business background…I think it’s well publicised that this cabinet or this government have not had business experience.”

In a wide-ranging conversation, Wheeler, who founded Charles Tyrwhitt as a student in Bristol in the 1980s, also revealed the business is “wargaming scenarios” as President Trump’s tariff policy risks causing significant disruption to the retailer’s fast-growing US operations.

Wheeler said that if the Trump administration imposes “full duty at retail price on products going to the US, that’s going to be very, very expensive for us.” The business is considering constructing a warehouse in the US and “shipping in at wholesale.”

From Covid and tariffs to a changing City style

Elsewhere in the interview, Wheeler discusses:

Why he’s always resisted taking external investment – “It’s not a given that you need to go out and find that.”

Early business mistakes – “I lost more money in three months than I made in the last three years and went bust…so that was a bit of a shock to the system.”

His three simple rules – “There are some very simple business rules that I think that every business should stick to, and actually a surprising number of businesses don’t stick to and I think that’s why a lot of businesses get into trouble along the way.”

How the disaster of the pandemic became an opportunity – “Covid was initially the worst time of my life and latterly probably one of the best things that ever happened to me, because it woke me up as to what was going on in the business. It was a damn good kick up the arse that we needed.”

Wheeler also talks about the current strength of the business and the changing styles and fashions in formalwear and workwear in the City, and gives his advice to aspiring entrepreneurs: “I think for the right person, it’s the best thing in the world.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Morrisons has announced that 365 jobs have been put at risk of being lost.

Supermarket giant Morrisons has put 365 jobs at risk after it revealed plans to close more than 50 of its cafes.


The Yorkshire-headquartered chain said 52 of its cafes, 17 convenience stores and dozens of meat and fish counters at its shops are slated for closure.


Morrisons said the closures are part of a “wide-ranging” review of the business.

As well as the cafes and convenience stores, 13 florists, 35 meat counters, 35 fish counters and four pharmacies and all 18 Market Kitchens are to be closed.


At the end of January, City AM reported that the Yorkshire-headquartered chain has achieved a revenue of £15.2bn for the 12 months to 27 October, 2024, up from £14.7bn.

Its group like-for-like sales also increased from 1.8 per cent to 4.1 per cent.


Morrisons: ‘Changes are necessary’

Morrisons chief executive Rami Baitiéh said: “The changes we are announcing today are a necessary part of our plans to renew and reinvigorate Morrisons and enable us to focus our investment into the areas that customers really value and that can play a full part in our growth.

“Morrisons Cafés are rightly famous for their great quality well-priced food, their place in the local community and their appealing mix of traditional favourites alongside exciting new dishes.


“In most locations the Morrisons Café has a bright future, but a minority have specific local challenges and in those locations, regrettably, closure and re-allocation of the space is the only sensible option.

“Market Street is a beacon of differentiation for Morrisons and we remain committed to it.

“But as we modernise we are making some necessary changes to the areas of the model which are simply uneconomic. In some stores where we are closing counters or Cafés, we plan to work with third parties to provide a relevant specialist offer.”


Cafes cull follows Sainsbury’s lead

The move comes after City AM reported in January that Sainsbury’s was planning to axe more than 3,000 roles as it prepares to close all its remaining in-store cafes.

Tech secretary Peter Kyle has promised not to pit the UK's creative industry against its burgeoning AI sector.

 
We have the third largest AI market in the world, and the second largest creative arts sector”, Kyle told the Financial Times on Monday. “I will not pit one against the other”.

The UK’s consultation on AI policy – which could allow tech firms to train models on copyrighted material – has triggered widespread backlash from the creative, entertainment, and media industries.

Critics urged that the proposed method of ‘opting out’ places an unfair advantage on tech firms, whilst placing creatives in a vulnerable position wherein their content can be scraped without compensation, unless they actively prevent it.

In response, newspapers across the UK launched a ‘make it fair’ campaign, together warning that AI companies may exploit their content without remuneration, threatening the sustainability of the news industry. 

Owen Meredith, chief executive of the News Media Association, said: “Copyright is fundamental to publishers’ ability to invest in trusted journalism. AI should be no different”.

The music industry also raised alarms following the news, with artists worrying that AI-generated songs could be built from components of their work, without consent or pay.

This move reflects a similar dialogue across the pond, where American record labels and publishers have filed numerous lawsuits against AI firms accused of infringing copyright laws.

Kyle confirmed that his department will review the 11,000 responses to its consultation before finalising its approach to the issue.

“We will find a way through it and get both sectors facing the future”, he argued, “fit for the digital age, with rights, protections, and ability to earn money in the digital economy.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Firms across London think the government will fall flat on its ambition to grow the economy, a new survey has shown.

Around nine in ten businesses across the capital doubt the government can achieve growth, according to research by the London Chamber of Commerce.

Some 70 per cent of firms said they did not even believe their own businesses would grow compared to last year.

The majority of 150 businesses surveyed also blamed Labour government policies stifling output.

The three main concerns cited were autumn Budget measures, lower-than-expected growth and the Employment Rights Bill – a “triple shock” that could send the economy into further decline.

Companies said they were in dire need of some relief from the Chancellor as just five per cent of businesses said raising taxes would help growth.

Three quarters said the rise to capital gains taxes would have a negative impact on their income.

London Chamber of Commerce chief executive Karim Fatehi said the survey painted a “stark picture”.

“Businesses do not have confidence that the government can deliver economic growth if it continues along a road of tax hikes and employment regulation.”

“They should listen to businesses and urgently change course,” he added.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly says the club is worth more now than the £2.5bn his consortium paid to acquire them in summer 2022.

The Blues have not won a trophy or qualified for the Champions League since the takeover, while Boehly's group has spent more than £1bn on new players.

Boehly told Bloomberg: "Yeah, I would say yes," when asked whether Chelsea had increased in value in that time.

He added: "I think the trend is our friend in this industry. I think the opportunity to be able to grow the fanbase around the world...

Because, unlike American sports, we have the ability to grow internationally and build our own revenue base on that international fanbase.

So I think the opportunity is enormous."

Boehly also believes the Premier League is sitting in a great place due to its competitiveness.

He said: "I mean, one of the frustrating things as Chelsea owner is that the Premier League has become so competitive...

But one of the great things about being in the Premier League is it's gotten so competitive, so the depth and the quality of the teams are unlike any other league in Europe or anywhere in the world."

Boehly also played down tensions with Clearlake Capital.

He said: "What the media writes about is 'exciting' but I just don't think it's realistic. If you look at the evolution of the team, we've been aligned on what we're trying to do and build..."

"It's a team that's young, that has long contracts, and all of those things were new.

In order to do all those things, it's obviously because we're aligned."

Boehly also spoke about Chelsea's stadium plans, saying the club "will build a new stadium".</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Prime Minister is focusing on regulating for growth, not just to prevent risk.

The government's recognition of excessive risk aversion in the system is correct.

We need to regulate for growth, not just against risk, to unlock our potential and drive substantial investment.


The economy shrank 0.1 per cent in January after 0.4 per cent growth in December but the overall picture for the UK is weak growth, according to the ONS.

The OECD recently revised its growth forecast for the UK trimming its GDP growth estimate for 2025 to 1.4 per cent.

The government must act decisively to drive economic growth both in the short and long term.


This regulatory reform must be complemented by mindset reform on the part of British businesses, who need to invest in new technologies, seize the opportunities on offer and find new ones overseas.

We are pleased to see the government making good on its commitments with the regulation action plan announced last week.


Top of the list, the City of London Corporation is proud to partner with HM Treasury, the regulators and the Office for Investment to establish a concierge service for international firms.

Foreign direct investment has been a key driver of economic growth not only in London but across the country.

In 2023 the UK attracted 222 financial and professional services projects involving 177 foreign companies valued at £1.1bn.


We welcome the FCA’s efforts to provide more support for high-growth firms and reduce regulatory reporting.

The City Corporation has been supporting the development of Regtech which will play a crucial role in reducing compliance costs, further aiding these firms.

JD Sports majority-owned by Pentland Group.

London broker Peel Hunt has downgraded its forecast for JD Sports ahead of the company’s full-year results next month due to short-term industry issues.

The broker attributed the downgrade to an overhang of Nike stock, which “is likely to persist deep into JD’s [next financial year].”

JD’s American revenue is particularly reliant on Nike footwear, but demand for the latter has faltered over the past year.

Last week, shares in Nike slumped to a five-year low after it reported a steeper-than-expected drop in fourth-quarter revenue – its fourth straight quarter of declining sales.

The result is a huge excess of ‘Classic’ footwear franchises: Air Force 1, Air Jordan 1, and Dunk.

“Simply put, there is an awful lot of stock left to shift, and consequently, the whole industry margin structure is impacted,” Peel Hunt analysts said.

JD Sports’ share price has been on a steady downward slope since last September.

Peel Hunt also noted that sales of other goods are unlikely to offset the downturn in Nike product sales due to low consumer confidence and spending.

JD Sports remains one of the top players in the footwear market.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

今や日本人の5人に1人が予備群と言われている糖尿病。国立国際医療研究センターの糖尿病情報センターによれば、患者の数は1000万人、予備群まで併せると2000万人とも言われている。

しかも、糖尿病の初期症状は、自覚症状があまりなく、放置しがちだが、悪化すると動脈硬化や神経障害、腎症、網膜症などの合併症を引き起こすこともある。また、低血糖症状になると、昏睡状態になり死の危険性もあるのだ。健康診断などで糖尿病、糖尿病予備群と言われた場合、食生活に気をつけ、血糖をマネジメントしていく必要がある。

この糖尿病患者の血糖マネジメントに関して、リアルタイムで血糖値が計測できる画期的な製品を展開しているのがアメリカ・サンディエゴに本社があるデクスコム社だ。昨年の4月に、満を持して日本法人デクスコムジャパン合同会社として事業継承。日本市場での本格展開がスタートしている。

デクスコムジャパンは、糖尿病患者の生活をどのように変えていくのか、また、糖尿予備群の人たちや健康な人たちへのサービスなど、これからの展開と可能性について、デクスコムジャパンを率いる浅野元社長に話を聞いた。

浅野元（あさの・げん）氏／デクスコムジャパン 日本法人社長。武田薬品工業で20年以上 勤め、最後は武田台湾の社長に就任。その後、ガーダントヘルスジャパンで代表取締役社長を務め、日本のがん患者のために貢献してきた。2024年2月よりデクスコムジャパンに合流。

北米での評価と知名度は高い

デクスコムは1999年に設立された医療機器メーカーだ。全世界に1万人以上の従業員を抱えており、2005年に米ナスダックに上場。時価総額は4兆1000億円（2024年11月時点）と 、株式市場からも高い評価を受けている。

そのわけは、世界中の糖尿病患者に対して有効な「持続血糖測定（CGM：Continuous Glucose Management）」測定器が市場から評価されているからだ。

日本法人が設立されたばかりということもあり、まだ日本では知る人ぞ知る存在だが、北米では、アメリカンフットボールの大会である｢スーパーボウル｣で2回CMを放送するなど、知名度は非常に高い。

そもそも糖尿病とは、インスリンが適切に分泌されなかったり、十分に働かなかったりすることで血液中の糖が増えてしまう症状だ。逆に、低血糖の状態が続くと、最悪の場合は死に至ることもあるため、糖尿病患者はしっかりと血糖マネジメントをする必要があるのだ。

「現在、世界中の糖尿病患者さんの多くは、指先に針を刺して血糖値を測っています。しかし、この方法はその瞬間の血糖値しか分かりません。デクスコムは世界で初めて、肌にセンサーを貼るだけで、血糖値を計測できるデバイスを生み出した企業のひとつです。しかも弊社のプロダクトは常時計測するリアルタイムCGMです」（浅野氏）

血糖マネジメントの3つの方法の中でも、デクスコムが採用しているのは無線接続によるリアルタイムCGM。 提供：デクスコムジャパン

肌に貼り付けておくだけで血糖値の変化がわかる

CGMの基本的な仕組みはシンプルだ。二の腕やお腹に、アプリケーター（肌に圧着する装置）を使ってセンサーを装着する。

このときにセンサーワイヤーが皮下に挿入され、間質液（細胞と細胞の間に存在する液体）のグルコース値がリアルタイムで取得でき、モニターで見られるようになる。

このセンサーは10日間使用でき、その間のグルコース値をリアルタイムで記録する。間質液のグルコース値と血糖値には相関関係があるため、血糖マネジメントができるようになるというわけだ。

血糖値は高くても低くてもよくない。予期せぬ高血糖と無自覚性低血糖が血管や健康にダメージを与える。 提供：デクスコムジャパン

「血糖マネジメントで大切なのは、高すぎず、低すぎないようにすることです。一日数回の刺突（せんし）、針を刺して血液を出す検査では、それ以外の時間の血糖値の動きが分かりません。中には患者さん自身が無自覚な高血糖、低血糖の変動があります。リアルタイムCGMならそれが分かります」（浅野氏）

さらにデクスコムは世界で初めてスマートフォン連携機能を実現。家族のスマートフォンを連携させておけば、離れた場所にいてもリアルタイムで血糖の状態がわかるため、子どもや高齢の患者を見守る家族も安心できるのだ。

「1型糖尿病のお子さんがいる親御さんは、夜間低血糖のリスクのために、心配のあまり眠れなかったりすることも。しかし、CGMなら低血糖が近づいてきたらアラートが鳴るから安心して眠れます。また、最大10人まで連携できるので、医療機関にもリアルタイムで共有できます」（浅野氏）

日本でも活用が始まっているが……

残念ながら現在、血糖値の計測は、指先などから採血をして簡易測定器で患者自身で測定する血糖自己測定（SMBG：Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose）が主流だという。

SMBGは測定したその瞬間の血糖値はわかるが、それ以外の時間の測定値は得られず、変動を把握することは難しい。一方CGMは間質液中のグルコース濃度から血糖値を推定しており、測定値はタイムラグが生じるものの、測定値の推移を把握できる。

CGMが主流となっていない現状は、日本の医療制度や慣習などさまざまな要素が絡まった結果だ。しかし、インスリンを使っている患者ならCGMは保険適用で利用できる。しかも、患者側の費用負担は採血用穿刺器具とほとんど変わらないのだ。

「海外と大きく違うのは、日本では1型糖尿病だけでなく、2型糖尿病でも保険適用で利用できることです。より多くの糖尿病患者さんに使っていただけます。まだまだ採血用穿刺器具を使っている患者さんが多い。特に2型糖尿病の方々には普及し切れていない状況です」（浅野氏）

現在の日本には推定130万人前後のインスリン等を使用している患者がいる。そのうち、1型糖尿病の患者は約7割がCGMを使っているが、2型糖尿病の場合、2割にも満たないそうだ。今後、デクスコムジャパンでは、これまでCGMを使っていない患者に対して、認知を広げていきたいと考えている。

リアルタイムの血糖値マネジメントで生活が変わる

血糖をリアルタイムでマネジメントできるようになると生活は大きく変わる。例えば日々の食生活でも、食べ方ひとつで血糖値の変化が分かるため、野菜から食べたり、炭水化物を減らしたりするなど、見える化ができるからこそ、血糖値が上がらない食べ方の習慣化ができる。

また、CGMは血糖値の変化の予想ができるため、上昇傾向にあるとき、下降傾向にあるとき、それぞれで事前対応ができるようになる。

「実際に試用に立ち会った際、栄養ドリンクを飲むとガッと血糖値が上がるのを目の当たりにしました。糖尿病になると食事療法や運動療法について口酸っぱく言われるのですが、なかなか実行するのは難しい。しかし、数字で見えると間違いなく行動は変わります」（浅野氏）

現在、CGMはインスリンを使っている患者に保険適用されている。このため、インスリンを打っていない段階の糖尿病患者や予備群の人は利用できない。しかし、すでに一部の医療機関では、経口薬が処方されている糖尿病患者向けに選定療養としてCGMの処方が始まっている。保険は適用されず、自費にはなるがよりしっかりと血糖マネジメントができるようになる。

「弊社のミッションは『健やかな生活をご自身の力で手に入れる』ことです。血糖マネジメントを介して、患者さんやご家族の生活に貢献していきたいと考えています」（浅野氏）

1000万人以上、日本人の約12％が糖尿病を罹患しているからこそ、CGMの普及は欠かせない。デクスコムジャパンは、糖尿病患者がより健康な生活を送り、合併症や低血糖によるトラブルを起こさないために、日本での活動を活発化させていく。

音楽ライブは安定して成長しており、不況の間も持ちこたえることができている。

ゴールドマン・サックスは、この業界が歴史的に見て不況に強い理由を5つ示した。

同行は、支出を切り詰めている場合でも、人々が音楽ライブを出かけていることを明らかにしている。

景気後退の話題が、ウォール街でますます広がっている。だが、たとえアメリカが本格的な不況に陥ったとしても、ある業界は安定して嵐を乗り切ることができる。それは、音楽ライブだ。

ゴールドマン・サックス（Goldman Sachs）はそう述べ、音楽ライブをエンターテイメントの他の形態よりも「不況に強い」と評価した。

1990年から30年以上、音楽ライブ業界は景気後退期に平均7.3％の成長を見せ、エンターテイメントの他の分野をしのいでいることを同行は明らかにした。

さらに、1990年以降、ライブエンターテイメントへの支出は735％急騰している。これはエンターテイメントにおける他のあらゆる形態、例えば、ギャンブル、スポーツ、劇場などをしのいでいるとゴールドマン・サックスは政府支出データを分析して示した。

「歴史的に見て、音楽ライブ業界は経済が不安定な時期にも、比較的強い回復力を示している」とスティーブン・ラシュチク（Stephen Laszczyk）率いるストラテジスト・チームは3月17日、顧客へのメモに書いた。

ゴールドマン・サックスは、音楽ライブが特に不況に強い理由を5つ挙げている。

1. 確立された業界である

過去30年で、音楽ライブ市場はニッチからメインストリームへと成長し、不況時にも音楽業界を支えてきた。

カスタム・マーケット・インサイツ（Custom Market Insights）によると、音楽ライブの世界市場規模は2024年、約348億ドル（約5兆1800億円）に達しており、今後10年間で625億ドル（約9兆3000億円）まで成長すると予想されている。

「比較的小規模な基盤から成長したことと、長年にわたり発展してきた強力で長期的追い風が相まって、個人消費が落ち込んでいる時期の影響を受けない複利的な収益成長を後押しした」とゴールドマン・は述べた。

2. 大規模な二次市場が存在し、公式のチケット販売者への悪影響が少ない

コンサートのチケットには巨大なリセール市場が存在し、市場を個人消費の落ち込みから保護している。

2019年、チケット転売業者は音楽イベント大手のライブネーション（Live Nation）の公演で、13億ドル（約1934億900万円）の利益を上げたと推定されている。

「我々はこの利益のプールを、個人消費の落ち込みを吸収する緩衝材だと見ている。例えば、不況の場合、二次市場が限界需要に対する圧力の大部分を吸収し、音楽ライブ業界の基礎的な収益性を保護することが期待される」とゴールドマンのアナリストは述べている。

3. 音楽ライブがグローバルになっている

音楽ライブは、ヨーロッパや北アメリカを大きく超え、今やコンサートの世界需要の大部分をラテン・アメリカやアジアが占めるようになった。この広がりが、アメリカ経済があまり良くない時にも、業界を守っている。

4. 比較的価値あるものを提供している

チケットの価格は過去数十年、インフレ率を超えるペースで上がっているが、コンサートは依然として、他のライブエンターテイメントの形態と比べ、まだ比較的安い。

ライブネーションのトップ100のコンサートの平均価格は2022年、約106ドル（約1万5800円）前後だった。それでも、平均約258ドル［約3万8000円］だったナショナル・フットボール・リーグ（NFL）の試合のチケットや、ブロードウェイ（Broadway）のショーのチケットの平均約133ドル［約1万9800円］よりも安いとゴールドマンの分析は示している。

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.businessinsider.jp/article/2503-elon-musk-responds-tesla-vandalism-protests/'>"I've done nothing wrong," Elon Musk says he was shocked by hatred and vandalism towards Tesla</a></h2><b>Source:</b> businessinsider&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 10:30:00 <p>
Elon Musk spoke about "anti-Tesla" vandalism in a recent interview.

Musk denounced the political left, suggesting that vandalism could also be linked to the Ministry of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts to identify fraudulent spending.

Musk said he was confused by the hatred directed at him and Tesla, saying that Tesla is a "peaceful" company and that he has done nothing wrong.

On March 18, when asked about vandalism against Tesla dealers and cars on Fox News, Musk criticized those involved in vandalism, saying vandalism against Tesla has reached levels that he has never seen before.

Musk also said that the vandalism was the political left-wing blame.

"It's a very shocking thing for me to have such hatred and violence from the left."

In the US, protests have been spreading since Musk began working at DOGE in January. Overseas, the slogan "Don't buy Tesla" has been called out in Germany in Berlin and Wales.

Tesla Takedown, a grassroots protest that began with BlueSky, competing with Musk's X (formerly Twitter), has called on Tesla owners to sell their cars and stocks in order to "stop masks now."

"I've always thought that the Democrats are a party of sympathy, a party of compassion, but they're burning cars, setting fire to dealerships, shooting bullets, destroying Tesla cars," Musk said.

"Tesla is a peaceful company."

"We've done nothing wrong."

Musk said the series of protests and vandalism could be part of a bigger conspiracy against him.

"I mean, who's funding and who's adjusting it. It's crazy. I've never seen anything like this."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bill Gates retired from Microsoft's CEO position in January 2000.

When Gates retired, he worried about the company's future, as he stated in an interview posted on March 13. He had two successors, and was lucky to have them, but he was concerned that he might be seeing the company decline and was worried about whether he should return.

Gates took over the CEO position for Steve Ballmer, who led the company from 2000 to 2014.

In his memoir, Source Code, Gates wrote that he transferred 4% of his shares to Ballmer, and persuaded him to quit business school and join Microsoft. Shortly after joining the company in 1980, Ballmer "became a 24-hour partner," Gates wrote.

Ballmer was taken over by Satya Nadella, who has been CEO since 2014.

According to Gates, his concerns were unfounded, as he now thinks about them. Because Ballmer "takes us to new heights" and Nadella is doing "the most complicated CEO job in the world."

The company has faced several important milestones since Gates' retirement from CEO, including reaching a record high market capitalization of $3 trillion at the end of 2024.

Gates was a member of the board of directors until 2020, but resigned after allegations of inappropriate behavior against female employees. Since then, he has spent much of his time at a charitable foundation he started with his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.businessinsider.jp/article/2503-trump-trade-war-stirring-booze-battles-eu-us-wine-whiskey/'>President Trump's trade war, swaying US whiskey and EU wine</a></h2><b>Source:</b> businessinsider&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 07:30:00 <p>
The European Union announced that it would impose a 50% tariff on American whiskey, starting April 1, in response to tariffs on American aluminum and steel.

 

President Trump warned that he would impose 200% tariffs on EU wine and liquor, including French champagne.

It is unclear when the tariffs will begin or whether the tariffs themselves will come into effect, but a response is occurring in the United States immediately.

For example, there are wine shops that promote to customers who want to stock up on European wines. One New York store sends emails to patrons recommending a bargain "customer avoidance" deal.

Alexandra Ivanac and her husband Stephen Varela, who runs the Italian-Croatian restaurant Villa Berulia in Manhattan, said the threat from Trump is "worrisome." The restaurant stocks approximately 75 types of European wines, offering them for a price of 2.5 to 3 times more than most dishes.

The owners of Villa Berulia are considering purchasing wine from countries outside the EU. They might absorb the costs or pass them on to customers.

According to Eurostat, the EU's statistics bureau, the US accounts for 31% of exports of EU wine and spirits.

Zach Pelka, co-founder of New York-based Une Femme Wines, said that the COVID-19 pandemic has made sourcing overseas complicated and expensive, making its supply chain completely complete within the US.

He said he predicts that if Trump calls 200% tariffs, the US-based liquor brands will gain more attention in the country.

Belka hopes that if the tariff threat becomes a reality, "Une Femme" will become an even more attractive option for restaurants, retailers, hotels and customers seeking a stable supply of wine within the United States.

The topic of tariffs has already led customers from other countries to purchase from local suppliers instead of importing them from the US. Many Canadians are seeking a "made in Canada" alternative after the Trump administration threatened and actually levied taxes on the country's products.

Even if customs duties are imposed, prices may not rise immediately.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

ソフトウェア業界は、AI関連の割安銘柄を探すには絶好の場所だ。ソフトウェア銘柄は、リスク回避の流れの中で下落したが、なかには堅実なビジネスモデルと継続的な収益成長を誇る企業も含まれていた。そして、ここでのポイントは、このセクターで銘柄を探すなら、このセクターの特長は急速な成長であり、何よりも収益成長に注目すべきだと、モーニングスターのテクノロジー担当シニア株式調査アナリスト、ダン・ロマノフ（Dan Romanoff）氏は述べた。

「ソフトウェア企業の株価指標と収益成長率を比較したチャートを描くだけでよい。収益成長率が高ければ高いほど、たとえ赤字でも、株価指標は高くなる」とロマノフ氏。

「ポートフォリオを俯瞰して見たとき、テクノロジー分野は通常、最も高い成長率をもたらす。だからこそ、成長が見込める分野に積極的に投資すべきだ」

重要なことは、最も優れた成長ストーリーを見つけることだとロマノフ氏は付け加えた。そして、その答えは、驚異的な成長を遂げている企業とは限らず、むしろ収益成長の持続性を示している企業かもしれない。つまり、収益の増加は新製品の発売による一時的なもので、次の四半期には失速する可能性もあるとロマノフ氏は述べた。その違いを見極めることが、短期的な売買と長期的な投資の機会を見分ける鍵となる。

ソフトウェア業界で現在、割安になっている銘柄の1つが、マイクロソフト（Microsoft）だ。20日時点で、年初から約7%下落している。しかし、優良企業であり、嵐の中の港のような存在だとロマノフ氏は指摘した。同社はWindowsでデスクトップOSにおける独占的な地位を、また、オフィススイートで生産性ソフトウェアにおけるほぼ独占的な地位を占めている。さらに、生成AIツールを導入したことで、AI競争におけるリーダーの座に躍り出たとロマノフ氏は述べた。またアズール（Azure）は、AWS（Amazon Web Services）、Google Cloud Platformと三つ巴の競争を繰り広げるクラウドプロバイダーでもある。ロマノフ氏は、（生成AIの）推論はクラウド上で実行されるため、クラウドプロバイダーは生成AIにおける真の勝者になると考えている。

アドビ（Adobe）も、注目すべきソフトウェア企業だ。同社は純粋なAI企業ではないが、これはむしろポジティブな要素だ。なぜなら、同社は堅実で、長期的なビジネスを続けてきたことを意味するからだ。同社の株価は今年、10%以上下落している。投資家は、生成AIに取って代わられることを恐れているためだ。実際、生成AIは画像作成能力が向上しており、アドビのプラットフォームが不要になる可能性がある。しかし、ロマノフ氏は、アドビの生成AI「FireFly」（テキストから画像、テキストから動画への変換機能を提供）は今後も必要とされると考えている。

「生成AIによって作成されたコンテンツを編集するツールは、引き続き必要とされるだろう」とロマノフ氏。

「広告業界で、キャンペーンのクリエイティブを作成している場合、作成した画像は、ブランドイメージを生み出し、届け、定義するために、きわめて厳密に編集する必要がある」

ソフトウェア業界では、サービスナウ（ServiceNow）も注目だ。同社はカスタマーサービスとITプラットフォームの提供で成功している。2024年第4四半期（10-12月期）の収益は前年から21.34%増加した。しかし、株価は年初から22%近く下落している。同社は堅実な長期的ビジネスを展開しており、生成AIによる収益はわずかだとロマノフ氏は指摘した。そして、ソフトウェアプロバイダーにとって重要な指標である年間継続収益は、堅調な成長軌道を維持していると付け加えた。

「マグニフィセント・セブン」の他の銘柄が気になる人もいるだろう。いくつかの銘柄も割安になっている。モーニングスターの5つ星格付けシステムによると、アマゾン（Amazon）、アルファベット（Alphabet）、メタ（Meta）の3銘柄は現在、4つ星評価となっている。

さらに、現在割安で、4つ星評価を受けている「ピック・アンド・シャベル」銘柄には、ASML、アドバンスト・マイクロ・デバイス（AMD）、マーベル・インターナショナル（Marvell International）がある。

最先端分野に投資したい投資家にとって、ロボティクスは、たとえ割安でなくてもAIとのインテグレーションによって、大きく飛躍する準備が整っている。この2つのセクターを合わせると現在、世界のGDPの1%を占めている。そしてVettaFiによると、2040年までに35%にまで拡大すると予想されている。需要は、製造、ヘルスケア、物流、農業などのエンドユーザーから生まれる。この成長余地は、投資家にとって1兆ドル規模のチャンスを生み出す。

しかし、このセクターへの投資はより難しいものになる可能性がある。なぜなら、企業の過去のファンダメンタルズは、将来の成功を測る最適な尺度とはならないからだ。VettaFiのディープテック分野の投資家兼リサーチャー、ゼノ・マーサー（Zeno Mercer）氏は、企業を評価する際には、AIまたはロボティクス関連のサブセクターへの貢献度を基準にすべきだと指摘した。また、技術的リーダーシップ、提携先など市場内でのポジション、存在感を高めるための戦略的投資を行っているかどうかも評価する必要がある。

さらに、技術的リーダーシップ、市場内でのポジション（どの企業と提携しているかなど）、そして存在感を高めるための戦略的投資も評価する必要があるという。

VettaFiのロボ・グローバル・ロボティクス・オートメーション・インデックス（ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index）は、このセクターの世界的トップ企業を探すことに有用だ。同インデックスの上位銘柄には、ロボット用精密制御機器メーカーのハーモニック・ドライブ・システムズ（Harmonic Drive Systems）、ロボットメーカーのファナック、産業用・製薬用・化学用機器メーカーのGEAグループAGなどがある。</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.businessinsider.jp/article/2503-quit-job-world-trip/'>He quit his job and traveled around the world without working...but he still received better benefits. The resume blank is not wasteful</a></h2><b>Source:</b> businessinsider&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 06:05:00 <p>
Many people will be worried if they can make a "blank period" on their resume that they are not affiliated with any company.

The concept of "career break," which positively views these "vacancies" due to job breaks or leave of absence as temporary suspensions, is gradually becoming more widespread.

In fact, many people have come to find new paths after their career breaks.

Maeda Keiko (37) found a job at a major Japanese manufacturer as a new graduate, and after changing jobs after working at multiple foreign companies, she decided to make a career break.

The trigger was the presence of a husband, a digital nomad who works remotely, moving around domestically and internationally.

Her husband's dream was to "travel around the world on his honeymoon."

However, I was confused about resigning. I think that having a "blank period" in your career will have a major impact on your reemployment.

Keiko, who was about to become in her mid-30s at the time, also had anxious age.

The couple discussed the children many times.

After quitting her job, Keiko and her husband set out on a journey around the world, which had not yet been decided.

During the year and a half of the world trip, Keiko was able to visit Jordan, which she had always wanted to visit.

On a trip around the world, I visited 60 countries.

As he continued his journey, there were events that shaking his values about his work.

What really struck me was when I was staying in Rwanda, central Africa.

Rwanda is also known as the "miracle of Africa" because it recovered from tragedy such as civil wars and genocides and economic growth accelerated rapidly.

When Keiko actually stayed there, she was surprised by the townscape, which felt cleaner than in Japan, and how well the security was.

He was shocked to hear from a Japanese woman he met in Rwanda that, "In Rwanda, even if you have an academic background and motivation, you don't have a job in the first place."

In Japan, the mainstream concerns are "assuming that you have a job," such as "what kind of work you will do" and "Whether you will find it rewarding."

However, in Rwanda there is no "the place to work."

It was an experience that made me realize how blessed I am to have a job, and made me think again about my career.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.cityam.com/uk-family-businesses-and-farms-slash-jobs-after-tax-overhaul/'>200,000 jobs to go after Labour’s inheritance tax raid</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cityam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 06:00:00 <p>
Family owned businesses and farms across the UK are cutting jobs, halting investment and selling assets to stay afloat in response to sweeping tax changes.

According to research by CBI-Economics, commissioned by Family Business UK, the government's move to cap business property relief (BPR) and reform agricultural property relief (APR) has triggered a wave of uncertainty.


The research found that the tax overhaul is expected to result in more than 208,000 job losses by the end of this Parliament. It has also projected a net fiscal loss to the Treasury of £1.9bn, undermining its own revenue expectations.

Unveiled as part of the government's broader effort to raise revenue, the tax changes place new restrictions on inheritance tax relief for agricultural land and property, and family-run businesses.


Under this move, BPR, which is a tax relief allowing family businesses to pass assets down generations without restrictive tax burdens, will now be capped at £1m. Meanwhile, the new rules have placed APR, which has long supported generational continuity within the farming sector, under reforms.


These will further limit tax exemptions on agricultural assets. Businesses have already taken drastic measures to mitigate the impact.

The study found that nearly a quarter of businesses (23 per cent) and 17 per cent of family farms, have already slashed their headcount since the Budget.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.cityam.com/eu-defence-why-buy-european-really-means-buy-french/'>EU defence: Why ‘buy European’ really means ‘buy French’</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cityam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 05:48:00 <p>
The European Commission has proposed a €150bn loan mechanism, Security Action for Europe (SAFE), to fund member states' investment in urgently needed capabilities.

This proposal is in response to President Trump's message that Europe can no longer rely on American military power and must look to its own resources.

The new EU defence spending plan would only be available to be spent with manufacturers which are wholly within the EU, Norway or Ukraine (65%) and countries which have signed security agreements with the EU (35%).

This stipulation would exclude not only American companies but also those in the UK and Turkey, as well as any weapons systems over which a third-party country had "design authority" or control over their use.

The rules place no limitations on products from four French companies: Thales, Naval Group, Safran, and Dassault.

SAFE is being used as a protectionist and political device by the EU, rather than just a financial one.

The EU's restrictions on SAFE argue that they are necessary to build up the European defence industry.

However, there are two additional aspects to consider: the provision allowing spending with companies in countries which have signed a security pact with the EU, and the potential market for UK firms like BAE Systems, Babcock International, and Rolls Royce being used as leverage on the British government.

The conditions attached to SAFE would allow the EU to use the potential market for UK firms as leverage on the British government.

This kind of industrial nationalism fits poorly with trends in defence manufacturing, which lean increasingly towards multinational co-operation to spread costs and risk.

A great deal of defence procurement across the continent involves non-EU players: the Mowag Piranha armoured fighting vehicle used by several countries is made by a subsidiary of General Dynamics, while the tracked CV90 in service with some countries is supplied by BAE's Swedish subsidiary.

There is one leading player which relies predominantly on domestic or EU equipment: France.

France has four companies that are not subject to any limitations under SAFE: Thales, Naval Group, Safran, and Dassault.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.cityam.com/what-not-to-expect-in-the-spring-statement/'>What NOT to expect in the Spring Statement</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cityam&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 05:42:00 <p>
The Spring Statement shouldn’t be a big thing, but it’s increasingly feeling like it could be.

Predictions on government fiscal policy are notoriously difficult, but 2025 feels like a year where that challenge is even more acute. Political and economic uncertainty has continued, there is an ever-increasing threat of global trade wars emanating from US tariffs and the UK’s economy has stubbornly refused to grow.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves tried to cut a confident figure last October. Her Budget message? We are sticking to a path of plugging (alleged) black holes through an increase in taxes, but it’s currently just this one NIC rise, and we are unrelenting in our focus on growth.

So now we have a Spring Statement. It’s probably not going to be a Budget, although there have been whispers it may include some fiscal changes. It should be an update on how things are going since we last heard from the Treasury – we all know that there is a lot of uncertainty, and that uncertainty is the enemy of investment, and, therefore, growth.

What are the uncertainties facing the Chancellor? As Neils Bohr, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist highlighted, forecasting is hard, especially when it’s about the future. The ONS forecasts appear to have been overly optimistic at best. Many independent forecasters have come up with lower numbers for growth, and lower-than-expected tax receipts suggest the headroom is gone.

Growth and productivity gains are illusive; lower paid workers are bearing the brunt of the NIC rises with job losses and reduced wage increases. Ordinary working people are feeling the results of the tax changes. While they attracted headlines (and possibly votes), the manifesto pledges of not raising the rates of the main taxes such as income tax and VAT may, in retrospect, not have been well judged in cutting off the most obvious sources of increasing tax revenues.

Headroom is the real problem. It’s essentially a fictitious number designed to tell the gilt market the rate of increase of the nation’s indebtedness and try to convince it that the finances of UK plc are under control. Despite the sophistication of the money market, the headroom calculation can be gamed.

The Spring Statement shouldn’t be a big thing, but it’s increasingly feeling like it could be. 

Re-evaluating Corporate Tax

Realistically, 25 per cent isn’t a hugely competitive corporate tax rate – especially if the new US President aims for a rate of 15 per cent. Even if it can’t be cut, aspiring to reduce the rate will get the attention of investors. UK firms deal with a lot of red tape and the new global minimum tax requires a lot of time and brainpower. US President Trump doesn’t like it.

Increasing workforce participation

Workforce participation has declined by 500,000 since Covid, so the key question is how we get those people back to work. Perhaps a special tax credit for both employer and employee if they return to work after a gap of 12 months should be considered.

Additionally, IR35 has been a bugbear for a generation. Many people do not want to be employees, but are put off by the uncertain tax status of contracting. Making the position simpler for engagers and workers may encourage many to return to the workplace.

Making the UK attractive to the wealthy

Encourage rich entrepreneurs to come to the UK or at the very least stop the wealthy voting with their feet and leaving. There was a time when encouraging City-types to come to London from all around the world was the driver of the UK economy, but this no longer seems to be the case, and it has been fashionable to use the tax system to put the wealthy off spending time here.

Boost London’s stock markets

Choosing to float a business in London has become less attractive. Reinstating VAT-free shopping for international tourists could help the retail and hospitality sector, especially at a time when US tariffs may make goods more expensive for domestic US consumers.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

"We see multiple paths for the company to create equity value by materially deleveraging its balance sheet through asset monetization," the analyst said in a note to clients Monday.

Shares of the satellite communications giant and competitor to Starlink – the satellite internet service owned and operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX – jumped more than 13% in afternoon trading after analyst Edison Yu upgraded the stock to buy from hold.

To be sure, Yu noted that he still has concerns regarding pressure from Starlink on Viasat's core communication services business in the longer term. Starlink has recently made moves over the past year to expand its presence in various countries.

Shares were last up more than 10%. The stock is on pace for its best day since Nov. 6, 2024 — the day following President Donald Trump's victory in the election — making it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for the day.

 Nonetheless, shares are still trading more than 44% below their all-time high from December.

 Tesla shares are headed for their best day in 2025 after falling for nine consecutive weeks due to rising controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk's political activities. There have been multiple incidents of vandalism and arson across Tesla showrooms and charging stations in the U.S. and Europe.

 Morgan Stanley recently cited this trend as it slashed its first-quarter delivery estimates, now predicting a decline of 9% year over year, due to negative brand sentiment and more intense competition.

 Tesla shares also benefited from an uptick in broader market sentiment Monday, after the Wall Street Journal reported Trump's reciprocal tariffs starting April 2 may be more targeted than previously expected.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The author highlighted a pair trading opportunity in October, recommending to long Lululemon (LULU) using a long call spread and short Nike (NKE) using a put spread.

Since then, LULU has risen nearly 8%, while NKE has fallen roughly 14%. The LULU call spread is close to its maximum achievable profit, and the Nike spread has reached peak profit. The author recommends taking profits and closing both spreads in the pair trade now.


The author notes that Lululemon will be reporting earnings on Thursday, and the options market implies that shares could move 10%, higher or lower, by the end of the week. Most potential profits in the call spread have already been made.


Nike's earnings results illustrate challenges for CEO Elliott Hill in turning around the athletic apparel and shoe company. While more analysts have a "buy" or "outperform" rating than a hold or sell, several reduced their price targets recently.


The author likes Lululemon because of its customer demographics (affluent and young) and growth prospects (> 7% YoY sales and earnings). However, Placer.ai data suggests year-over-year foot traffic is down 7.6% from February to the end of February.


Bloomberg's "Second Measure" data estimates observed sales are 3.2% higher YoY, which is well below prior years' growth or the broad market. The author would be more confident picking up LULU shares at a discount to their current price, potentially using a zero-cost 1x2 put spread.


The author suggests buying one May $315 put and selling two May $290 puts for essentially no net cost. This trade could profit even if LULU falls modestly post-earnings or rally post-earnings without any harm due to the zero net outlay of premium.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bitcoin is more closely correlated to the Nasdaq than it is to gold most of the time, and investors could benefit from viewing it as another big tech stock, says Standard Chartered.

Bitcoin's correlation with the Nasdaq is currently at about 0.5, after it approached 0.8 earlier this year, according to the bank. Meanwhile, its correlation with gold has been falling since January, touching zero at one point, and is now just above 0.2.


Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered's global head of digital assets research, said in a note Monday: "Bitcoin trading is highly correlated to the Nasdaq over short time horizons."

This Nasdaq correlation leads to the idea that bitcoin could be included in a basket of large tech stocks; if it were included, the implication would be more institutional buying as BTC would serve multiple purposes in investor portfolios.


Kendrick said he still sees the flagship cryptocurrency serving its purpose but that "in reality … the need for such hedges is very infrequent." Standard Chartered created a hypothetical index dubbed "Mag 7B," in which it added bitcoin to the Magnificent 7 tech stocks – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla – and removed Tesla.


"Mag 7B has outperformed Mag 7 by about 5% over the period since December 2017," he said. "On a calendar year basis, Mag 7B outperformed Mag 7 in five out of seven years, albeit by a very small margin in 2022."


Kendrick said bitcoin has been trading in a similar volatility-adjusted fashion to Nvidia since President Trump's inauguration. They're down 16% and 12%, respectively, since Jan. 20.


Meanwhile, Tesla, which has lost 36% in the same period, is trading more like ether (down 38% since Jan. 20). "Investors can view bitcoin as both a hedge against [traditional finance] and as part of their tech allocation," Kendrick said.


Kendrick said: "Indeed, as BTC's role in global investor portfolios becomes established, we think that having more than one use will bring fresh capital inflows to the asset." This is particularly true as bitcoin investment becomes more institutionalized.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

There has been a change to inherited individual retirement account rules which mandates that certain heirs must take required withdrawals each year or face an IRS penalty.

Starting in 2025, certain beneficiaries must take annual required minimum distributions while depleting inherited IRAs over 10 years, according to final regulations released in July.

The "10-year rule" and RMD requirement applies to most non-spouse heirs — commonly, adult children — if the original IRA owner reached RMD age before their death.

Meanwhile, the average investor doesn't know a great deal about these guidelines, said certified financial planner and enrolled agent Catherine Valega, founder of Green Bee Advisory in the Boston area.

Stocks surged on Monday, with major averages up over 1%, following reports of President Donald Trump taking a softer stance on tariffs.

Technicians are watching key levels to see if the rally is sustainable or just a temporary relief after last month's pullback, during which the S & P 500 dipped into correction territory. .SPX 1M mountain

JC O'Hara, chief market technician at Roth Capital Partners, wrote that if the bounce is more than a simple oversold move, the S & P 500 should retain 5,825.

The first move that should be celebrated by bulls is a successful close above 5,700 as that is the level where sellers have become very aggressive.

A close above 5,700 would be a less than 1% gain. On Monday, the S & P 500 was at 5,762 at noon.

Oppenheimer's Ari Wald said he's waiting for the S & P 500 to reclaim resistance at 5,750, which also represents the 200-day moving average for the benchmark.

He noted 5,500 is a critical support level for the broader index, while resistance is more "formidable" at 5,900, which also represents the 50-day moving average.

Wald said risk leadership, in particular, is oversold, meaning this is an area where investors can add exposure.

In regards to attractive tactical conditions for risk, the High-Beta vs. Low-Volatility ratio is trading 10% below its 200-day average.

A new oral GLP-1 medication, orforglipron, is being developed by Eli Lilly to treat obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Eli Lilly's phase two trial examined different doses of the pill in overweight or obese patients, with a highest dose of 45 milligrams. The company is only giving doses of up to 36 milligrams in phase three trials on orforglipron. Overweight or obese patients who took 36 milligrams of the pill once a day lost 13.5% of their body weight on average after 36 weeks.

The study found that patients who received the placebo had an average weight loss of only 2.3%. Eli Lilly expects weight loss in people with diabetes to be "significantly less" than patients with obesity who don't have diabetes, according to Daniel Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer. In a phase two trial, orforglipron led to an HbA1c reduction of up to 2.1% at 26 weeks in adults with diabetes.

The company is also conducting late-stage trials on the medication for patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. The ATTAIN-J study will examine orforglipron in Japanese adults with obesity, while the ATTAIN-1 and ATTAIN-2 studies will look at its use in adults with weight-related comorbidities.

Eli Lilly's Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Skovronsky said on an earnings call that patients who took orforglipron lost 13.5% of their body weight on average after 36 weeks, while those who received a placebo had only 2.3% average weight loss.

Weight loss among diabetes patients could come in between 6% to 8%, Schott said, and hemoglobin A1c – a blood test that measures the average blood sugar level over the past two to three months – is expected to improve by 1.8 to 2.1 points.

In terms of gastrointestinal side effects, orforglipron's nausea and vomiting rates in the phase two trial were "meaningfully greater" than those among patients who took 2-milligram doses of semaglutide in a phase three trial, Leerink's Risinger said.

But he expects patients to tolerate Eli Lilly's pill better in phase three trials because they are longer in duration than the mid-stage studies and likely involve slower titration. On safety, Schott said he expects a "very low probability" of any issues that could put the entire development program for orforglipron at risk.

Positive data on the pill and a potential approval would be a boon to Eli Lilly, but could also be good news for other companies developing oral GLP-1s, according to some analysts.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The U.S. government is considering proposals to hit containerships made in China with steep fines when they call on U.S. ports.

 
Business interests, from U.S. farmers to global ocean carriers, are warning of severe economic damage from these proposals.

 

An estimated 98% of the global fleet would be subjected to fees when calling on U.S. ports because the fee applies to both existing Chinese-built vessels or future vessels in the order book of carriers, and any carrier with at least one order on the books for a vessel made in China.

 

On Monday, a hearing was being held by the U.S. Trade Representative to consider the implementation of penalties.

 

A report released in January concluded that China's shipbuilding and maritime industry had an unfair advantage.

 

The nation's agriculture exporters are united in concern and opposition to the proposal, according to Peter Friedmann, executive director of the Agriculture Transportation Coalition.

 

There are no U.S.-built vessels suitable for international commercial shipping that exist today that can move agricultural cargo, moved by container ships, bulk ships, and breakbulk ships, and across products that include corn, wheat, grains, and soybeans.

 

The U.S. government has proposed steep levies on Chinese-made ships arriving at U.S. ports: For Chinese-owned operators (such as COSCO), a service fee of up to $1 million could be charged on each vessel; for non-Chinese-owned ocean carriers with fleets containing Chinese-built vessels, the service fee would be up to $1.5 million for each U.S. port of call.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The U.S. dollar banknotes and a label with the word "Recession" are seen in this illustration taken March 19, 2025.

Fed officials raised their outlook for core inflation to 2.8%, well above the central bank's 2% goal, though they still expect to achieve that level by 2027.

Still, Powell and his colleagues at the two-day policy meeting that concluded Wednesday lowered their estimate for gross domestic product this year to just a 1.7% annualized gain. Excluding the Covid-induced retrenchment in 2020, that would be the worst growth rate since 2011.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week acknowledged the worries but said he still sees the economy as "strong overall" featuring "significant progress toward our goals over the past two years."

Though unemployment remains low and most data points suggest continued if slowing growth, the survey results reinforce the message from sentiment surveys that consumers and business leaders are increasingly concerned that a slowdown or recession is a growing risk.

The probability of a downturn in growth over the next 12 months is about 43%, as set by the average view of 400 respondents during the period of March 17-20.


The combination of higher inflation and slower growth raise the specter of stagflation, a phenomenon not experienced since the early 1980s. Few economists see that era replicated in the current environment, though the probability is rising of a policy challenge where the Fed might have to choose between boosting growth and tamping down prices.

Markets have been nervous in recent weeks about the prospects ahead. Bond expert Jeffrey Gundlach at DoubleLine Capital told CNBC a few days ago that he sees the chances of a recession at 50%-60%.

Powell, though, doubted that a repeat of the previous bout of stagnation is in the cards. "I wouldn't say we're in a situation that's remotely comparable to that," he said.

Barclays analysts noted that "market-based measures are consistent with only a modest slowing in the economy," though the firm expects a growth rate this year of just 0.7%, barely above the recession threshold.

UCLA Anderson, a closely-watched and widely-cited forecasting center, recently turned heads with its first-ever "recession watch" call for the economy, based largely on concerns over President Donald Trump's tariffs.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Google announced plans to buy Israeli cybersecurity startup Wiz for $32 billion, its biggest acquisition ever.

 

The deal comes months after an initial $23 billion offer fell through and Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport touted plans for an initial public offering.

 

Deal activity has slowed from its 2021 heyday, but appetite has begun to pick up.

SailPoint went public in February, and CoreWeave, which sells Nvidia's AI processors, said it plans to raise up to $2.7 billion in its IPO that's expected this week.

 

Cybersecurity companies look particularly poised to win as companies hunt for ways to shield their highly profitable business models.

CB Insights on Tuesday said cybersecurity solutions are one of the top acquisition target areas for 2025.

 

The proliferation of artificial intelligence and the transition to the cloud has amplified the need for cybersecurity solutions.

More adept hacking schemes have accelerated since OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, expediting the need for cutting-edge solutions to fend off attackers.

 

This is a business that is fundamental to operating, so cybersecurity has been a resilient area for quite some time.

While megacap technology giants haven't shied away from cybersecurity investments, AI tail winds have forced companies to beef up their offerings.

Google's Wiz deal could force rival Amazon to make its own acquisition, said Merritt Maxim, Forrester vice president and research director.

Potential targets include startups Aqua Security, Orca Security, and Sysdig.

 

The Google-Wiz tie-up does give them some capabilities that make them stronger than AWS in some areas, said Maxim.

AWS could target acquisitions to potentially bring their solution closer to Google.

 

Wiz's mammoth buyout may dampen near-term sentiment for cybersecurity startups with IPO aspirations.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Satellite communications giant Viasat could be poised for growth in the coming months, according to Deutsche Bank.

On Monday, the bank upgraded Viasat — a competitor of Starlink, the satellite internet service owned and operated by SpaceX — to buy from hold and upped its price target to $15 from $13. That reflects more than 53% upside from Friday's close.


While the stock has risen about 12% in March and 15% in 2025, shares have underperformed the broader market over the past six months, falling more than 23%. 

The bank's analyst, Edison Yu, believes there is opportunity for gains through monetizing its L-band spectrum. He said it is "attractive due to its reliability (e.g., avoid rain fade) and versatility (cover wide area with small antenna)".


Ligado's recent deal with AST SpaceMobile sees Ligado gain access to its L-band in both the U.S. and Canada, a majority of which is owned by Viasat. Yu estimates that Viasat owns at least two-thirds of the 40 MHz.

Separately, Viasat owns L-band outside of US/Canada which can be used for [direct-to-device] services. The company is also working with the European Space Agency and Space42 (UAE) to develop potential solutions.


Yu also believes there is opportunity in Viasat selling its Defense and Advanced Technologies assets. In a spin-off situation, DAT can command a much higher valuation on its own over time given 'Defense Tech' public comps such as Kratos and Karmin trade at materially higher multiples.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

President Donald Trump announced on Monday that the U.S. will impose 25% tariffs on countries buying oil and gas from Venezuela.

Countries that buy oil and gas from Venezuela will face tariffs on any trade they have with the U.S., Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.

The tariffs take effect on April 2, the president said.

Venezuela exported about 660,000 barrels per day in 2024, according to data from Kpler.

China was the largest destination for the South American nation's crude exports, purchasing 270,000 bpd last year.

Matt Smith, an oil analyst at Kpler, told CNBC that this announcement appears to be one more action targeting China.

Brent crude futures rose 61 cents, or 0.85%, to $72.77 a barrel by 1:15 p.m. ET.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 59 cents, or 0.86%, at $68.87.

The U.S. was the second-largest destination for Venezuelan crude last year, importing about 233,000 bpd, according to Kpler.

India purchased about 61,000 bpd and Spain bought nearly 60,000 bpd in 2024.

Trump has sought to increase pressure on the Maduro regime since taking office.

The president accused Venezuela of sending Tren de Aragua gang members to the U.S. when announcing the tariffs on Monday.

The Trump administration has designated the gang as a foreign terrorist organization.

Wall Street got off to a strong start Monday, with the Nasdaq leading the way up 2%. The S & P 500 was up more than 1.5% while the Dow was up over 1%. The rally was sparked by hope that President Donald Trump will soften his stance on putting reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners.

The "Magnificent Seven" stocks — Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla — were all higher. The Club owns all of them, except Tesla, which was up more than 9% on Monday. But the EV maker's shares were still down over 30% in 2023, due in part to tariff uncertainty.

The market got a lift Friday on Trump's "flexibility" comments on reciprocal tariffs, set to go into effect on April 2. And then over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump is adopting a more targeted approach to the tariffs. Bloomberg News reported that some nations will be excluded from tariffs. 

Jim Cramer said these reports indicated that Trump is monitoring the stock market and investors should keep that in mind. "I think we have to get away from the idea that he's not paying attention [to the stock market].The president cares, and this is what you're seeing."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

従業員の間に満ちている現在の空気をひと言で表現するなら、「肩をすくめてやり過ごそう」とでも言えばいいだろうか。

テスラの株価が史上最高値を更新した2024年12月前後に初めて購入した投資家なら、この急落に恐怖を感じるのも無理はない。しかし、報酬を株式で受け取って長期保有している従業員たちの目に映る景色は、短期投資家たちとは全く異なるようだ。

ある従業員からはこんな正論が聞かれた。

昨年の同時期（つまり2024年3月中旬）と比べればまだ30〜40％高い水準だし、ましてや5年前との比較なら690％も上昇していて、とんでもない水準であることに変わりはないと。

一方、それとは別の複数の従業員が、株価の変動にはあえて目を向けないようにしていると口を揃えた。その中のテキサス拠点に勤務するある従業員は「毎日株価を見ていたら気が変になるよ」と語った。

株価パフォーマンスに影響を及ぼす変数はいくつもあって、もちろんイーロン・マスク最高経営責任者（CEO）の各種行動もその一つだが、それは従業員がどうこうできるものではない（から考えても仕方がない）、というのがその従業員のスタンスだった。

そうした意見は、Business Insider編集部が直接取材していない従業員にとっても、特段違和感のないもののようだ。

テスラ社内のコミュニケーションツールには、株価の値動きをテーマに一部の従業員が意見を交換する場として利用している非公式チャンネルが存在し、そこでも（株価下落に対して）特に際立った反応はないと複数の従業員が証言する。

同チャンネルには一部の従業員と言っても数千人が参加しており、自社に関係するソーシャルメディア投稿やニュース記事を共有するのに使われているという。

ネバダ拠点に勤務するある従業員はそれらを総合して、社内には「陰うつな空気」も「危機感」も漂っていないと語った。

自社株を保有する従業員の心理

テスラにおいて株式報酬の付与は大きな役割を果たしており、それを同社の最も魅力的な特徴の一つと考えている従業員も少なくない。

マスク氏もそれをよく分かっていて、テスラの生産拠点はミリオネアを多数輩出してきたと過去に発言している（米経済誌フォーチュン、2023年11月30日付）。

従業員の中にはそれと異なる立場もある。近頃退社したある従業員はこう指摘する。

「付与された株式報酬の価値が跳ね上がって一気に富裕層の仲間入り、といったシナリオに期待してテスラで働いている従業員がいることは間違いありませんが、そういう人に限って長続きしないのが現実です」

また、別の従業員2人は、株価のボラティリティ上昇（により報酬が目減りするリスクの増大）を受け、「長期キャッシュ」型の報酬オプションを選んだことを、Business Insiderに明かした。業績を反映して決定したインセンティブ報酬を、その後数年（通常4年間）にわたって繰り延べて現金支給する仕組みという。

Business Insiderが独自入手したテスラ社内の給与関連書類（2021年時点）によると、同じテクノロジー業界や自動車業界の企業に比べてベースサラリー（基本給）は見劣りするものの、インセンティブ報酬としての株式付与が大きい。

年次報告書の記載によれば、テスラは2024年に譲渡制限付株式ユニット（RSU）で約26億9000万ドル、ストックオプション（新株予約権）で約35億ドルを従業員に付与している。

上述の長期キャッシュ型報酬を選んだ従業員2人は、自分たちを含むテスラの従業員にとって株価の変動は大きな関心事ではないと強調した。

マスク氏はデフォルトで物議を醸す存在

テスラは今、経営トップであるマスク氏のトランプ大統領との親密な間柄や、米政府効率化省（DOGE）の責任者としての発言力、影響力がハレーションを引き起こし、国民からの強い抗議とそれを要因の一つとする株価急落に直面している。

ニューヨーク・タイムズ（New York Times）はこの2月、マスク氏がX投稿でナチスの親衛隊長だったヒムラーや、総統ヒトラーの後継者と目された国家元帥のゲーリングらに不適切な形で言及したことを批判したテスラのマネジャー、ジャレッド・オットマン氏が解雇されたと報じた。

しかし、Business Insiderの取材に応じたテスラのあるエンジニアは、従業員がマスク氏についてさまざまな形で繰り返し質問を受けることに苛立ちを感じていると前置きした上で、こう語気を強めた。

「自分の会社のCEOについて考える機会って、どのくらいありますか？CEOの行動に個人的に責任を負っているって考えてますか？」

そのように社内にはさまざまな意見や見方があるものの、取材に応じた10人の従業員のうち8人が口を揃えたのは、会社の先行きはおおむね安泰だろう、ということだった。

あるマネジャーは端的にこう述べた。</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.businessinsider.jp/article/tesla-stock-elon-musk-politics-sales-selloff-upgrade-ev-trump-2025-3/'>Tesla's sales will increase as a tailwind after Musk's political activities. Latest analysis of TD Cowen</a></h2><b>Source:</b> businessinsider&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 00:00:00 <p>
Stock prices have been declining since hitting a record high in mid-December, and at this point, the decline has spread to around 48%. The market capitalization, which was up to $1.5 trillion, has shrunk to around $780 billion.

The direct cause of this slump is Musk's political involvement. He provided huge amounts of funds to Trump in the presidential election last November, and since the launch of the second Trump administration, he was the head of the newly established US Department of Efficiency (DOGE), and has pioneered debate with numerous actions that fueled political conflict.

TD Cowen analyst Itai Micheli pointed out that Musk's moves will be a tailwind for Tesla in the future. "There are things that people who are concerned about Tesla's future are overlooked: Tesla loses share in counties with more Democrats (due to Musk's political activities), while increasing share in groups with more Republicans.

Tesla has gained fame as a pioneer in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, and has expanded sales, particularly in the liberal area, which is the Democratic support base. However, as Musk rose to conservative stardom throughout the November 2024 presidential election, Tesla's brand is beginning to be eroded in areas that have traditionally been "strong" (Mikeli).

If the situation continues at stake, Tesla will certainly face headwinds before the tailwinds blow. So this is not the case for a demand forecast for the first quarter (January to March), where severe results are expected.

According to UD Cowen's basic scenario, Tesla's medium- to long-term sales will decline by 22-28% in Democratic-backed counties, totaling 105,000 units, but EV penetration rates will rise to 9.7% in Republican-backed counties, while Tesla's sales will increase by 107,000 units.

The changes that this trend will bring are also positive for Tesla's competitors, with General Motors, Hyundai and Ford EVs benefiting.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Regardless of whether the US Department of Efficiency (DOGE) works, it is undoubtedly true that Musk has spent '110%' of his time as head of the second Trump administration. This has transformed Tesla into a political symbol, of course, which is not good for investors.

Ives presented Tesla with a prescription, which was at a turning point. "If Musk wants to bring this crisis to an end, so that the Tesla brand crisis that we've built up to this point will become snowballed over the next few years and eventually turn into a Black Swan (an unpredictable, hugely impactful extreme event), then we have to tackle two things."

One is to explain in his own words how Musk will manage Tesla's management and role as head of the Ministry of Government Efficiency Ministry at the first quarter (January to March) earnings announcements, or at the information session, scheduled for early May.

Another is to clarify the "roadmap of development for low-cost EVs and when to market," which Tesla has announced to launch within the year, and also provide a detailed perspective on the "robotic taxi service to be launched in Texas from June." Ives believes that there are a lot of issues, including the complete revamp of the Model Y, the main SUV (multipurpose sports car), the issue of inventory management (surplus), and the sluggish demand due to brand damage, and investors will not be convinced unless Musk himself explains what he thinks about these issues.

Tsai Capital President and Chief Investment Officer Christopher Tsai recently spoke to Business Insider and emphasized that it is important to separate Musk's behavior as director of the Ministry of Government Efficiency and his involvement at the heart of the US government (in a position to exert influence). "Elon is in a position to form policies (in favor of Tesla's business expansion) by engaging in the government. I think negative market sentiment will eventually fade and disappear."</p></b><br/><br/></div>
