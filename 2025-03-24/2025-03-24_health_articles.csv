I always choose to talk about a lesser-known woman from history. Women like the Black woman who designed Jackie Kennedy’s iconic wedding dress – Ann Cole Lowe. Or Susan Ahn Cuddy, known as the first Korean immigrant to settle in Los Angeles and the first Asian American woman to join the U.S. Navy. Like Cuddy and Lowe, countless others were trailblazers who changed history, but may never be a household name.

I’ve thought a lot about the unknown women in the migraine community. I know they’re there. I’m intrigued by who the powers-that-be opt to include in history lessons versus those who remain in obscurity. The journalist in me has never been satisfied not knowing who was at the forefront. I want to know who’s behind the scenes, the hidden stories.

What I do know is that women are often more impacted by chronic migraine.

Migraine is three times more likely to impact women than men.

Migraine affects 30% of women over a lifetime.

The frequency, duration, and intensity of migraines in women tend to be greater.

1 in 5 U.S. women have had a migraine vs. 1 in 10 men.

I hope efforts are made to unearth those women who were integral to migraine research. Until then, here are a few women from my Women’s Migraine Hall of Fame.",webmd

For years I’ve endured the stares of strangers and sometimes even peers, but in doing so, I’ve also become more attuned to the struggles of others. So when I walk past someone with a visible ailment, I see them, not just their condition but their resilience, daily battles, and quiet strength.

I truly believe there’s an unspoken connection among those of us with visible conditions. It’s a silent acknowledgment that only we know what it’s like to be judged for something beyond our control within the first few seconds. This vow of silent acknowledgment allows us to move forward despite the odds. My empathy for others allowed me to build one of my greatest strengths.

Another surprise with eczema is that it didn’t just disrupt my days, but it stole my nights too. I never realized how deeply it would impact my sleep until I found myself trapped in an exhausting cycle of relentlessly itching nights. I would scratch until my skin bled and became discolored, waking up to a sea of flakes, raw patches, and an overwhelming sense of fatigue.",webmd
https://news-medical.net,Waist circumference identified as a stronger cancer risk marker in men,https://news-medical.net/news/20250324/Waist-circumference-identified-as-a-stronger-cancer-risk-marker-in-men.aspx,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Body size and excess weight, conventionally assessed using body mass index (BMI), are well-established risk factors for many types of cancer. However, new research to be presented at this year's European Congress on Obesity (ECO 2025, Malaga, Spain, 11-14 May) and published in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute shows that waist circumference (WC) is a stronger risk marker than BMI for developing obesity-related cancers in men, but not women. The study was conducted by Dr Ming Sun, Dr Josef Fritz and Dr Tanja Stocks, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden, and colleagues.

The study analysed data from 339,190 individuals collected from various Swedish populations who had undergone health assessments with BMI and WC assessments from 1981-2019 (61% objectively measured, 39% self-reported, mean age 51.4 years). Cancer diagnoses were obtained from the Swedish Cancer Register.

Established obesity-related cancers were defined as those for which the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has concluded there is sufficient evidence linking them to obesity, including cancers of the esophagus (adenocarcinoma), gastric (cardia), colon, rectum, liver/intrahepatic bile ducts, gallbladder, pancreas, breast (postmenopausal), endometrium, ovary, renal cell carcinoma, meningioma, thyroid, and multiple myeloma.

The authors calculated relative risks associated with obesity-related cancers for WC and BMI, taking into account multiple factors that could influence the results, such as age, smoking habits, and sociodemographic factors including education level, income, birth country and marital status.

Because WC is harder to measure accurately and consistently than BMI, its values tend to vary more. To ensure a fair comparison, the researchers adjusted for measurement errors in both WC and BMI. This adjustment makes the calculated relative risks of WC and BMI more directly comparable. Finally, because WC and BMI are measured on different scales (1 standard deviation [SD] = 3.7 and 4.3 kg/m² for BMI for males and females respectively, and 10.8 and 11.8 cm for WC for males and females respectively), calculating relative risks per 1-SD increase ensures that the increments for WC and BMI represent comparable magnitudes, allowing for a direct comparison of their associated relative risks.

During a median follow-up of 14 years, 18,185 established obesity-related cancers were recorded. In men, a WC increase of approximately 11 cm (e.g., comparing a WC of 100.8 cm versus 90 cm) was associated with a 25% higher risk of developing obesity-related cancers. By comparison, a BMI increase of 3.7 kg/m² (e.g., comparing BMI of 27.7 kg/m² versus 24 kg/m²) corresponded to a 19% increased risk. Additionally, after accounting for BMI, high WC still remained a risk factor for obesity-related cancer in men. This suggests that the elevated risk associated with abdominal adiposity is specific, and not explained by high body size alone, as measured by BMI.

Among women, the associations were weaker and similar for both WC and BMI. For example, both an increase of about 12 cm in waist circumference (e.g., comparing WC of 91.8 cm vs. 80.0 cm) and an increase of 4.3 kg/m² in BMI (e.g., BMI of 28.3 kg/m² vs. 24 kg/m²) were both associated with a 13% higher risk of developing obesity-related cancers.

The authors explain: ""BMI is a measure of body size, but does not provide information on fat distribution, whereas waist circumference is a proxy more closely related to abdominal adiposity. This distinction is crucial because visceral fat, which accumulates around the abdominal organs, is more metabolically active and has been implicated in adverse health outcomes, including insulin resistance, inflammation, and abnormal blood fat levels. Consequently, individuals with similar BMIs may have distinct cancer risks due to differences in fat distribution.""

On the difference between men and women, they reflect: ""A plausible explanation is that men are more likely to store fat viscerally, while women generally accumulate more subcutaneous and peripheral fat. Consequently, waist circumference is a more accurate measure of visceral fat in men than in women. This may make waist circumference a stronger risk factor of cancer in men, and explain why waist circumference adds risk information beyond that conveyed by b in men, but not women.""

They suggest: ""Including hip circumference into risk models may provide further insights into this sex difference and enhance the association between WC and cancer, particularly for women – this is because, especially in women, the combination of waist circumference and hip circumference give a better estimation of visceral fat than waist circumference alone.""

They go on to explain that research has indicated that adiposity, especially central adiposity, leads to higher concentrations of circulating insulin in men than in women. This may also partly explain why WC is more strongly associated with cancer risk in men. They say: ""The divergence in how waist circumference and BMI relate to cancer risk between men and women underscores the complexity of the impact of adiposity on cancer development. It suggests that considering biological and physiological differences between the sexes might be helpful when assessing cancer risk. Further research is needed to explore these sex differences.""

They conclude: ""Our study provides evidence that waist circumference is a stronger risk factor than BMI for obesity-related cancers in men, but not in women. Additionally, waist circumference appears to provide additional risk information beyond that conveyed by BMI in men. The weaker contribution of WC beyond that of BMI in women may result from sex-specific interactions with adiposity measures, such as with sex hormones, on obesity-related cancer risk, or differences in how waist circumference and BMI reflect body fat in men vs. women. Future research incorporating more precise measures of adiposity, along with comprehensive data on potential confounding factors, could further elucidate the relationship between body fat distribution and cancer risk.""",news-medical
https://news-medical.net,Simple urine test may spare kidney cancer patients from invasive scans,https://news-medical.net/news/20250324/Simple-urine-test-may-spare-kidney-cancer-patients-from-invasive-scans.aspx,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","A simple urine test could accurately show the recurrence of kidney cancer at an early stage, potentially sparing patients invasive scans and enabling faster access to treatment, new research has shown.

The findings are presented today [Monday 24 March 2025] at the European Association of Urology (EAU) Congress in Madrid and have been accepted for publication in European Urology Oncology.

The test analyses the distinctive profiles of certain types of sugar molecules, called glycosaminoglycans which are found in urine. These profiles are known as the GAGome.

The international AURORAX-0087A (AUR87A) study is assessing whether a GAGome test can accurately detect the return of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) following surgery. This is the most common form of kidney cancer and accounts for up to 90% of cases. There are around 400,000 patients diagnosed with ccRCC worldwide each year.

Around one-fifth of ccRCC patients who have surgery to remove their cancer will see it return within five years – the majority within the first two years. Currently, the only way to monitor patients is through a scan – usually a CT scan – every 6 to 12 months, with the frequency depending on their level of risk.

The study's initial cohort involved 134 patients treated at 23 hospitals across the UK, EU, USA and Canada. The patients were all diagnosed with ccRCC which had not spread beyond the kidney, and which was treated with surgery. Most had their kidney completely removed. All patients continued to have CT scans as standard monitoring after surgery, alongside a urine test every 3 months. Each urine sample was analysed using mass spectrometry to produce a score out of 100, called the GAGome score.

After up to 18 months of follow up, 15% of patients had seen their cancer return. The GAGome test was extremely sensitive in picking up recurrence, correctly identifying 90% of patients whose cancer had returned, while correctly ruling out just over half of those who remained cancer-free. These results were based on a GAGome score threshold optimised at 12/100. A score above 12 was counted as positive, and 12 or below as negative.

A positive result in the study yielded a 26% chance the patient actually had a recurrence. More importantly, a negative GAGome score resulted in a highly reliable 97% chance that the patient did not have a recurrence. The higher the GAGome score, the more likely the positive result correctly identified recurrence.

This level of accuracy is similar to CT scans and offers advantages to using scans alone, according to lead researcher on the study, Saeed Dabestani, Associate Professor at Lund University and Consultant Urologist at Kristianstad Central Hospital, Sweden.

CT scans often pick up small lesions that aren't large enough to biopsy, and we currently don't know whether they are a sign of the cancer returning or not. Our only option is to do more frequent scans to monitor more closely, which is unpleasant for patients and often brings little benefit. If you have a urine test that can accurately show whether the cancer has actually returned then you can better assess risk levels and reduce the frequency of the scans required. Based on the results we have so far, it's likely that we could safely halve the number of scans that patients have to undergo."" Saeed Dabestani, Associate Professor at Lund University and Consultant Urologist at Kristianstad Central Hospital, Sweden

Dr. Carmen Mir Maresma, Consultant Uro-Oncologist from University Hospitals La Ribera in Valencia, Spain, and member of the EAU Scientific Congress Office said: ""Developing biomarkers for kidney cancer is a major challenge and this study provides a stepping stone towards that goal. The results are really interesting, in that the test showed a high negative predictive value. If the test comes back negative, you can be more or less sure there is no cancer recurrence, but if it's positive, then we need to look further. The test is also based on a suite of biomarkers, rather than just one molecule, which provides a more robust basis for making decisions on treatment.

""We don't know yet whether finding recurrence sooner will save patients' lives – more research is needed to determine that. There are also changes in post-operative treatment underway, with some countries licensing the immunotherapy pembrolizumab for kidney cancer. More research will also be needed to understand how this biomarker interacts with that therapy.""

The international team involved in the AUR87A study is nearing final recruitment of the second cohort of patients, the results from which will be used to validate the findings from the first cohort. These results are expected towards the end of this year.

The GAGome test used in the AUR87A study is under development by Swedish diagnostics company, Elypta, for whom Dabestani also acts as a medical adviser. The test has not yet been approved for clinical use in diagnostic procedures and further research will be required to confirm its effectiveness in clinical practice.",news-medical

While its exact causes remain elusive, mounting evidence suggests that viral infections, particularly Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), may worsen disease severity. Elevated EBV DNA and RNA levels have been detected in the colonic tissues of UC patients, correlating with more aggressive symptoms, higher risks of surgery, and poorer treatment responses. However, the precise mechanisms linking EBV to UC progression have remained a mystery. Given these challenges, scientists have been eager to unravel how EBV contributes to UC and explore new therapeutic strategies.



In a pivotal study (DOI: 10.1093/pcmedi/pbaf002) published on January 21, 2025, in Precision Clinical Medicine, researchers from West China Hospital, Sichuan University, investigated the role of EBV in UC. By analyzing tissue samples from UC patients and conducting experiments in mouse models infected with murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68)—a close relative of EBV—the team uncovered a critical connection between EBV infection and macrophage-driven inflammation. Their results highlight a previously unknown mechanism that amplifies UC symptoms.



The study revealed that EBV infection dramatically increases the levels of pyroptosis-related proteins, including Gasdermin D, NLRP3, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-18 (IL-18), in the colon. Macrophages infected with EBV exhibited excessive inflammatory responses, leading to severe intestinal damage and compromised gut integrity. Notably, the researchers identified glycolysis as a central driver of this process—fueling the inflammation that worsens UC. Importantly, when the team blocked glycolysis using the metabolic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), macrophage pyroptosis was significantly reduced, leading to decreased inflammation in the colitis-afflicted mice. These findings establish a direct link between EBV, metabolic dysregulation, and immune activation in UC.



Dr. Hu Zhang, the study's corresponding author, underscored the importance of these discoveries: ""Our research provides compelling evidence that EBV actively contributes to UC severity by triggering inflammatory cell death in macrophages. More significantly, we have identified glycolysis as a potential target for intervention. By disrupting this metabolic pathway, we may be able to curb EBV-driven inflammation and improve treatment outcomes for UC patients.""



These findings could revolutionize UC treatment strategies. Current therapies primarily rely on immunosuppressants, which, while effective at controlling inflammation, may leave patients more vulnerable to viral infections like EBV. The study suggests that targeting glycolysis could offer a new therapeutic avenue—one that specifically combats EBV-induced inflammation while preserving immune function. Additionally, antiviral treatments that directly suppress EBV replication could be explored as adjunct therapies for UC patients with confirmed EBV infections. The next step will be clinical trials to translate these promising findings into real-world treatment strategies.



This research not only uncovers a hidden viral trigger in UC but also paves the way for innovative, precision-based therapies—offering new hope to patients struggling with the relentless burden of inflammatory bowel disease.

https://news-medical.net,Researchers develop tool to enhance NK cells against cancer,https://news-medical.net/news/20250324/Researchers-develop-tool-to-enhance-NK-cells-against-cancer.aspx,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","A team of researchers from the Hospital del Mar Research Institute, the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and the Pompeu Fabra University has developed a new tool that allows modifying these NK cells to make them immune to the tumor’s defense mechanism.

Among other functions, the NK cells (Natural Killers, a type of lymphocyte forming part of the immune system) have the capacity to detect and eliminate cancer cells. But in some cases they cannot overcome the tumor's defense mechanism and the cancer grows. Now, a study published in Nature Immunology, with the involvement of the Hospital del Mar Research Institute, the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and the Pompeu Fabra University, proposes a new approach to strengthen NK cells in their fight agaist tumor cells.

The study, which included the collaboration of researchers from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, the German firm Miltenyi, and the Dutch firm Glycostem Therapeutics, was developed under the context of a European network. It also included the involvement of researchers from the Hospital Clínic-IDIBAPS, and from the CIBER Cancer Unit (CIBERONC), the CIBER Hepatic and Digestive Disorders Unit (CIBERehd), and the CIBER Infectious Diseases Unit (CIBERinfec). To strengthen the capacity of NK lymphocytes to eliminate tumors researchers used CRISPR/Cas9, a genetic editing tool, to eliminate a gene from these cells and make them resistant to two molecules that produce tumor cells.



The goal of the study was to confirm whether modified NK cells had the capacity to overcome the negative effects of the TGF-β and Activin A molecules in preclinical models of HER2 positive breast cancer tumor cells and metastatic colorectal cancer cells. The majority of solid tumors contain an abundance of both molecules to protect themselves against attacks from the immune system. The results, both in vitro and in mice models, demonstrate that the genetically modified NK cells are capable of reaching the tumors, penetrating and destroying them, i.e., break their protective barrier. ""When we compare genetically modified cells with non-modified cells, the first have a greater capacity to control the growth of in vivo tumors, both alone and when combined with other treatments and therapies being used, such as for example specific HER2 antibodies"", explains Dr. Aura Muntasell, researcher from the Immunity and Infection Research Group of the Hospital del Mar Research Institute and lecturer in the Department of Cell Biology, Physiology and Immunology of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona.

Modifying the SMAD4 gene

To achieve these effects, researchers deactivated a specific gene, the SMAD4, involved in the signalling of TGF-β and Activin A. ""To achieve this disactivation, the NK cells were transitorally exposed to the CRISPR/cas9 system, programmed with a guide so that they could head specifically towards the SMAD4, edit it and disappear"", explains Marc Güell, ICREA research lecturer and head of the Synbio Lab of the Pompeu Fabra University (UPF).



""By eliminating the SMAD4 we make these cells resistant to the TGF-β's inhibition but we continue to make use of the rest of the molecule's signaling to have them acquire a greater capacity to reach tumors and penetrate them"", adds Dr.. Muntasell. The study now published allows demonstrating the safety and efficiency of this approach. In collaboration with other institutions, it was also possible to verify that using it with other treatments under development that are based on the NK cells enables boosting its effect. ""This strategy is also applicable to NK cells generated through different protocols, including those expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), which allows recognizing specific antigens found in cancer cells. In addition, it is promising for several clinical indications, since the TGF-β suppresses the immune response in multiple types of cancer"", points out Dr.. Anna Rea, first author of the article on the research conducted in her PhD thesis project at the UPF.



So far, treatments based on NK lymphocytes have been successful in hematological tumors, but have not achieved the same level of effectiveness in solid tumors. ""These genetically modified NK cells offer a great treatment opportunity for patients with solid tumors that are currently resistant to immunotherapy"", explains Dr. Clara Montagut, researcher at the Hospital de Mar Research Institute and head of the Digestive Oncology section in the Hospital del Mar Medical Oncology Service.



Dr. Muntasell and Dr. Montagut are precisely the two researchers leading a project that has received one of the independent research grants from the Instituto de Salud Carlos III. The grant will go towards developing a phase I clinical trial, the first of its kind, to prove the safety and tolerability of CRISP/Cas9-modified NK cells in combination with other treatments, in patients with refractory colon and rectal cancer.",news-medical

""I was very surprised that we couldn't help Black youth as much as white youth, and we don't know why there was such a profound difference in the outcomes."" said lead researcher Patrick Pössel, Dr. rer. soc., a professor of counseling psychology at the University of Louisville.

Pössel and some colleagues in Germany developed the LARS&LISA depression prevention program about 25 years ago, which was implemented successfully in schools in Germany and later in Tennessee.

The current study, published online in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, included 425 freshman students (57% Black, 43% white) in a Louisville, Kentucky, high school serving primarily low-income students. Half of the students were in a control group while the other half participated in the 10-week LARS&LISA program.

The LARS&LISA program, which includes vignettes with two characters named Lars and Lisa, uses group sessions designed to build motivation through personal goal setting followed by aspects of cognitive behavioral therapy. Students are encouraged to recognize unhelpful thoughts and replace them with more helpful thoughts. In addition, they learn about the pros and cons of assertive, aggressive, passive-aggressive and withdrawing behaviors. They also practice the skills needed to form new social networks.

The students completed questionnaires about depressive symptoms before and after the LARS&LISA program and in a follow-up survey four months later. White youth who participated in the program reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms after completing the program and at the follow-up period. However, Black youth in the program didn't differ from the control group, with no significant benefits found after completing the program or at the follow-up period.

The study couldn't determine why the program was unsuccessful for Black youth so more research is needed, not only on that issue but to identify whether other depression treatment programs or models may experience the same shortcomings, Pössel said.

Psychological theories and treatment programs are largely developed based on white, middle-class, female American clients or college students in psychology courses. We need to take a step back and examine the consequences of these limitations. It's essential to be attentive to cultural and racial differences and not assume there's a one-size-fits-all approach."" Patrick Pössel, lead researcher

Other researchers found similar concerns with another youth depression prevention program that is based on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. That study found the Penn Resiliency Program helped white and Latino youth but showed no significant effects on the depressive symptoms for Black youth. Other studies have found that Black youth's experiences with racism may put them at higher risk of depression, anxiety and suicide.

In the current study, the participants were from one high school in Louisville, Kentucky, who participated in the LARS&LISA program so the findings may not be generalizable across the United States or to other youth depression prevention programs. Only students who identified as white or Black were included in the analysis so there were no findings for other racial groups.",news-medical

The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.

To assess weight patterns and their associations with kidney cancer and its different subtypes, investigators analyzed information on 204,364 individuals from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, including body mass index (BMI) data when participants entered the study (an average age of 61.6 years), and prior BMI recordings at 18, 35, and 50 years of age. The team noted that there were 1,425 cases of kidney cancer, or renal cell carcinoma (RCC), among the study's participants, with 583 having aggressive RCC and 339 having fatal RCC. The researchers also recorded the different subtypes of RCC, including clear cell RCC (541 patients), papillary RCC (146 patients), and chromophobe RCC (64 patients).

Higher BMI at any of the ages assessed was linked with higher risks of overall RCC and all subtypes (except chromophobe RCC), with a 10-40% higher risk for each 5-unit increase in BMI. Similar increased risks were linked to weight gain during adulthood that resulted in overweight or obesity, compared with maintaining normal BMI.

Also, long-term excess weight was associated with higher risks of overall RCC, aggressive RCC, fatal RCC, and clear cell RCC, but not papillary RCC and chromophobe RCC. Weight loss in which BMI was reduced by at least 10%, particularly later in life, was associated with a lower risk of RCC. Specifically, weight loss from age 18–35 years and after age 50 years was associated with 21% and 28% reductions in RCC incidence, respectively.

These findings emphasize that maintaining a healthy weight across one's lifetime is important for reducing RCC risk. More importantly, weight loss, even later in life, may offer protective benefits. We should support initiatives that promote healthy weight maintenance and weight loss strategies. Some of these include lifestyle interventions, weight-loss programs, and emerging medical treatments for obesity; however, individuals should consult with their healthcare providers prior to initiation of any plan.""

https://news-medical.net,Microdosing for Mental Health: Hype or Hope?,https://news-medical.net/health/Microdosing-for-Mental-Health-Hype-or-Hope.aspx,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 05:15:00 GMT","Microdosing psychedelics, typically lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or psilocybin, has recently gathered attention for its potential to improve mental health. Although self-reported benefits include heightened creativity, mood enhancement, and reduced symptoms of depression, scientific evidence remains limited.

Nevertheless, anecdotal evidence strongly suggests low doses may support cognitive flexibility and mindfulness, thereby alleviating rumination. However, most findings come from small-scale or observational studies, with many confounding factors, such as expectancy effects, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.1

While early research on single low-dose LSD or psilocybin shows minimal adverse physiological effects, increases in anxiety and mood fluctuations have also been reported. Tolerance may develop quickly, suggesting that careful scheduling is crucial for sustained benefits. Crucially, large-scale, placebo-controlled trials are still needed to determine efficacy, safety, and overall long-term impact on depressive symptoms.1

This article explores the science behind microdosing psychedelics, its potential mental health benefits, risks, and the ongoing research to determine its therapeutic value.

Image Credit: Losangela/Shutterstock.com

Mechanism of action

Low doses of psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin primarily act through the brain’s serotonin system, notably by binding to 5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2A) receptors on neurons in key regions such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.

As partial agonists, these substances subtly modulate both excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) neural signaling. In other words, they can nudge the balance of neuronal activity without triggering the pronounced perceptual alterations typical of higher doses.2

By engaging 5-HT2A receptors, low-dose psychedelics promote moderate changes in cellular signaling pathways, including those involving intracellular calcium and the release of neurotransmitters.

This can result in a mild increase in neuroplasticity, essentially making it easier for neurons to reorganize and form new connections. These small shifts in connectivity patterns are thought to facilitate flexible thinking, creativity, and stress resilience.2

Moreover, these compounds gently affect the default-mode network (DMN), a brain system active during self-reflective thought and mind-wandering. Under low-dose conditions, psychedelics may reduce the DMN’s rigid activity, loosening habitual rumination without causing the full “ego-dissolution” reported at higher doses.

Altogether, these mechanisms underlie the mood, cognition, and creativity benefits attributed to psychedelic microdosing while minimizing the more intense hallucinogenic effects.2

Psychedelic Medicine: Past, Present, and Future

Cognitive and emotional benefits

Cognitive and emotional benefits, including reported enhancements in creativity, focus, and emotional resilience, have been increasingly associated with interventions like psilocybin therapy.

Some participants who have undergone carefully guided psilocybin sessions describe heightened imaginative thinking, allowing for original and meaningful ideas and fresh perspectives. This mental flexibility can foster greater problem-solving abilities and stimulate personal or professional creativity.3

Additionally, a sense of sharpened focus is often noted during or after psilocybin experiences, as it may temporarily diminish habitual cognitive patterns that hinder concentration. By altering perception and promoting introspection, these experiences might also boost emotional resilience.

Over time, individuals can potentially develop improved stress management skills and maintain greater stability in emotionally challenging circumstances. 3

Researchers suggest that psilocybin’s effects on neural pathways, combined with the reflective nature of the experience, could explain outcomes. The subsequent “afterglow” period, marked by ongoing feelings of well-being, is believed to play a pivotal role in consolidating positive changes.

Although preliminary findings remain subject to further scientific inquiry, they underscore a growing interest in harnessing psilocybin’s potential to bolster creativity, refine focus, and build emotional fortitude. With the rise of rigorous clinical trials, these cognitive and emotional benefits continue to intrigue scientists and clinicians worldwide.3

Does Microdosing Actually Work? Play

Risks and ethical considerations

Microdose clinical trials, though designed as minimal-risk studies, present certain concerns. There is still some risk to participants, including unforeseen pharmacokinetic variations and radiation exposure from labeled compounds.

Additionally, there are financial and resource costs, and the predictability of therapeutic dose effects remains debated. There is also a risk of exploitation, where participants, particularly in vulnerable populations, may not fully understand the implications of their involvement.4

Placebo-controlled trials present certain risks and ethical concerns. These include the potential for participants to encounter unanticipated side effects, as placebos can lead to both beneficial and harmful responses, commonly referred to as placebo or nocebo effects.

Ethically, investigators must ensure participants are fully informed of known and possible risks, including the uncertainty regarding outcomes, which can complicate consent. The nocebo effect can intensify symptoms or produce adverse events when participants anticipate negative consequences, potentially undermining the principle of beneficence.4,5

In many jurisdictions, ethical guidelines and legal regulations require detailed disclosure of key aspects of study participation, ensuring individuals can make autonomous decisions about their involvement. Failure to address possible placebo effects may lead to suboptimal sample-size calculations or misinterpretation of results, potentially invalidating trial outcomes.

In cases where studies investigate subjective measures, such as pain, the influence of participants’ expectations can be significant, emphasizing the need for precise language and transparent protocols.4,5

Legally, researchers and sponsors must adhere to federal guidelines, institutional review board requirements, and any relevant international standards, emphasizing accurate disclosure and participant protection.

Ultimately, balancing scientific rigor with comprehensive patient understanding is essential to safeguard participant welfare while advancing knowledge in medical research and maintaining public trust.4,5

Clinical trials and scientific evidence

Recent controlled studies on microdosing psychedelics, particularly LSD, have focused on understanding both acute and long-term effects. These trials, conducted under rigorous double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions, have primarily examined physiological, behavioral, and subjective effects in healthy adults.4,6

Low doses of LSD (5-20 mg) have shown acute effects on mood, neural connectivity, and pain perception. Some studies indicate potential therapeutic effects for depression, anxiety, and cognitive performance, but findings remain inconsistent. While short-term mood improvements have been observed, repeated doses did not lead to sustained cognitive or emotional benefits.4,6

No serious adverse events have been reported. Common side effects include increased blood pressure, mild anxiety, and occasional headaches. Anxiety-related withdrawal occurred in a subset of participants. Repeated dosing over six weeks did not produce harmful effects but also lacked evidence of cumulative therapeutic benefits.4,6

Future of psychedelic research

Recent regulatory shifts and expanding therapeutic evidence suggest that psychedelics are poised to play an increasingly significant role in mental health care. After decades of prohibition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to substances such as 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression.

These approvals accelerate research and could prompt rescheduling from Schedule I to a classification more conducive to medical use. As large-scale phase 3 trials continue, scientists are focusing on safety, efficacy, and the mechanisms underlying these substances’ profound psychological effects.

Emerging data indicate that psychedelics, combined with structured psychotherapeutic support, can yield rapid and long-lasting symptom improvement, surpassing many conventional interventions.7

Simultaneously, alternative frameworks are taking shape, including state-level legalization efforts and group-based therapy models designed to reduce costs. Moving forward, rigorous studies must address practical challenges such as equitable access, clinical training, and insurance coverage.

Researchers are also increasingly investigating applications beyond depression and PTSD, including substance use disorders, existential distress in terminal illness, and eating disorders. As psychedelic interventions evolve, thoughtful collaboration among clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and communities will be essential. In doing so, we can ensure safe, evidence-based integration of these once-maligned substances into modern therapeutic paradigms.7

The Truth About Mushroom Coffee: Benefits vs. Hype

Conclusion

Scientific Validity & Clinical Potential Microdosing psychedelics, such as LSD and psilocybin, is gaining attention for potential mental health benefits. Early studies suggest improvements in mood, creativity, and cognition, but evidence remains limited.

Most research relies on self-reports, with placebo-controlled trials showing mixed results. While neurobiological mechanisms indicate possible antidepressant effects, long-term safety and efficacy are unclear. Regulatory challenges and inconsistent dosing further complicate clinical adoption.

More rigorous, large-scale studies are needed to validate therapeutic claims. Until then, microdosing remains an intriguing yet unproven intervention, requiring cautious exploration within controlled settings.

From an environmental perspective, polluted air can cause acid rain, crop damage, decrease plant growth and productivity, and cause harm to wildlife. For humans, the inhalation of polluted air may lead to respiratory problems, heart disease, cancer, and other severe health issues. This is a concern as 99% of humans worldwide breathe air exceeding the WHO guideline limits on air quality.1,2

Particulate matter and aerosols are pollutants of particular concern. This article presents the drivers of air pollution and highlights two instruments used for continuous ambient air quality monitoring.

Differences between particulate matter and aerosols

Particulate matter (PM) refers to small solid particles suspended in a gas. In contrast, aerosols are finer liquid droplets or solid particles that remain suspended in gases for prolonged periods of time. PM and aerosols can negatively affect human health, particularly when their diameters are under 2.5 µm (PM 2.5 , Figure 1).

Aerosols and PM can originate from natural sources, including volcanic eruptions, but they are often generated from human activities such as industrial operations and transportation. As a result, industrial air quality monitoring is critical in identifying emission sources and the chemical composition of pollutants and in informing strategies to reduce human exposure.

Analytical methods for PM and aerosol quantification

Analyzing PM and aerosol content typically consists of collecting samples and analyzing them. Representative samples must be collected using appropriate equipment and techniques, and a filtration process must be generally used.

Particles are collected from substrates with filters exposed for a certain duration before being removed with deionized water before the subsequent analysis.4 However, this method can only measure particle averages over 24 hours or longer, is cumbersome and imprecise, and cannot support continuous online measurements.

Continually taking samples of aerosol composition is key to understanding and addressing air quality challenges. Specifically, data obtained in real-time provides insights into changes in aerosol composition, thus allowing quicker responses to pollution events and increasing the accuracy of scientific investigations into atmospheric processes.

Modern technologies require continuous aerosol analysis to address these limitations. Devices that collect steam, including the Metrohm AeRosol Sampler (MARS) and the 2060 Monitor for AeRosols and Gases in ambient Air (MARGA) (Figure 2), offer continuous, real-time, monitoring of aerosol composition. The advanced techniques utilized by these instruments provide valuable data for air quality assessment and research.

Figure 2. Inline sample preparation for gaseous samples is made simpler using the 2060 MARGA (left) or MARS (right) systems from Metrohm Process Analytics. Image Credit: Metrohm Middle East FZC

The 2060 MARGA separates gases and aerosols sampled from the same air mass through selective dissolution in water. The resulting solutions, available every hour, are then analyzed using ion chromatography with conductivity detection.

The separation of gases and aerosols enables the detection of crucial precursor gases and ionic species present in the aerosols and provides a more comprehensive understanding of air quality.

In terms of chemical analysis, the MARS device (Figure 3) is specifically designed for aerosol analysis and is typically coupled with external wet chemical analyzers, like ion chromatographs. These are used for cation and/or anion analysis or voltammetric (VA) systems.

The MARS's modular approach offers greater flexibility and adaptability. It accommodates a wider range of analytical requirements than the 2060 MARGA, which integrates anion and cation ICs internally.

Figure 3. MARS enables comprehensive analysis of air samples with IC, VA, or both. Image Credit: Metrohm Middle East FZC

Both instruments (2060 MARGA and MARS) include gas denuders (Wet Rotating Denuder (WRD); Figure 4, left), a condensation particle growth sampler (Steam-Jet Aerosol Collector (SJAC); Figure 4, right), and pumping and control devices.

These instruments convert aerosol particles into droplets in a supersaturated water vapor environment. After being mixed with carrier water, the collected droplets are continuously fed into sample loops or preconcentration columns for analysis.

Figure 4. Left: Wet rotating denuder (WRD) for easy gas removal. Right: Steam-Jet Aerosol Collector (SJAC) incorporated in the MARS and 2060 MARGA. Image Credit: Metrohm Middle East FZC

How to decide between the MARS and the 2060 MARGA

While MARS is designed specifically for sampling aerosols, the 2060 MARGA measures aerosols and water-soluble gases. Unlike classical denuders that remove gases from the air sample before reaching the aerosol collector, the 2060 MARGA captures gaseous species in a Water-Resolving Device (WRD) for online analysis.

In contrast, aerosols with low diffusion speeds pass through the WRD without interference.

The 2060 MARGA is available in two configurations: R (research) or M (monitoring). The R version is intended for research campaigns, such as studying seasonal air quality variability. When the R version is not required, the ion chromatograph can be uncoupled and repurposed for other laboratory applications.

New technologies focus on integrating continuous aerosol analysis to address this caveat in traditional sampling methods. Devices such as the Metrohm AeRosol Sampler (MARS) and the 2060 MARGA (Monitor for AeRosols and Gases in ambient Air) provide real-time, continuous monitoring of aerosol composition.

These instruments employ sophisticated techniques to collect and analyze aerosols, resulting in the measurement of valuable data for air quality assessments.

sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium ions, as well as trace

gases, including sulfur dioxide and ammonia. Analysis method Can be paired with different analysis techniques

2060 MARGA M – Dedicated continuous

monitoring

The following compares the correlation between aerosol sampling and measurement using the 2060 MARGA and MARS. Given that the aerosol results from the 2060 MARGA are known to be accurate, a strong correlation between instruments would suggest that MARS also measures aerosols with comparable accuracy.5

The graphs illustrate the aerosol results of ambient air in Schiedam, the Netherlands, from June 6-9, 2022, using the 2060 MARGA and MARS systems via ion chromatography. The 2060 MARGA operates with a cycle time of 60 minutes, while MARS has a cycle time of 30 minutes.

Although MARS generates twice the data, leading to higher aerosol concentration readings, applying a moving average to correct the data to a 60-minute cycle reveals concentrations were similar in both systems.

Conclusion

Monitoring air pollution is critical for identifying and quantifying the composition and levels of pollutants in the air. Exposure to air pollution can lead to various health issues for humans, including respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. High levels of air pollution also pose environmental risks, contributing to acid rain, ozone depletion, and climate change.

Utilizing tools, including the 2060 MARGA and MARS from Metrohm Process Analytics, will improve air quality measurements and subsequently enhance the assessment of impacts from different pollutants as well as develop effective strategies to minimize exposure. By doing so, research can help inform and drive decisions for a healthier and more sustainable environment for everyone.

https://news-medical.net,Citrus remedy squeezes out dry mouth for cancer patients,https://news-medical.net/news/20250324/Citrus-remedy-squeezes-out-dry-mouth-for-cancer-patients.aspx,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","A natural citrus oil from oranges, lemons, and limes is proving highly effective in relieving dry mouth, and when combined with a new lipid formulation, new research suggests it may be effective without significant side effects.

Developed by the University of South Australia in collaboration with the Medical School at Stanford University, this world first formulation uniquely combines limonene (a citrus essential oil) with a lipid-based drug delivery system to treat dry mouth (xerostomia), a common side effect of radiotherapy.

The new formula demonstrated 180-fold better solubility than pure limonene in lab experiments and boosted relative bioavailability by over 4000% compared to pure limonene in pre-clinical trials.

Dry mouth is the most reported side effect following radiotherapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer, affecting up to 70% of patients due to salivary gland damage. It can lead to difficulty speaking and swallowing, significantly reducing quality of life.

Limonene has protective effects on saliva production during radiotherapy, but its poor solubility means high doses are needed to take effect, and these cause indigestion, abdominal discomfort and unpleasant ‘citrus burps’.

Lead researcher, Professor Clive Prestidge says UniSA’s new limonene-lipid combination creates a ‘super-solubilizing’ treatment that reduces dry mouth at lower dose and without uncomfortable side effects.

“The therapeutic benefits of limonene are well known. It’s used as an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and mood-enhancing agent, and can also improve digestion and gut function. But despite its widespread use, its volatility and poor solubility have limited its development as an oral therapy,” Prof Prestidge says.

“As limonene is an oil, it forms a film on the top of the stomach contents, causing significant stomach pain and discomfort.

“Our novel formulation combines limonene with healthy fats and oils – called lipids – to create a super-solubilizing compound that the body can easily absorb with reduced uncomfortable side effects.

“This increases the dispersion of limonene in the stomach, boosts absorption, and controls biodistribution – all while increasing a patient’s saliva production and reducing dry mouth.”

Co-researcher Dr Leah Wright says the formulation has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for cancer patients and others suffering dry mouth conditions.

Cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and other medical treatments regularly experience dry mouth, which not only prevents them from comfortably swallowing, but can also have other negative and potentially life-threatening outcomes.” Dr Leah Wright, Co-researcher, University of Adelaide

""While limonene can be ingested directly, it’s not well tolerated, especially by those with dry mouth. Plus, its poor absorption prevents it from effectively reaching the salivary glands – the target site.

“This inventive and highly impactful limonene-lipid formulation could provide a simple, effective oral solution for dry mouth, offering cancer patients long-lasting relief and comfort, improved oral health, and a higher quality of life during a difficult time.”

Clinical trials for the new formula are ongoing, with next steps to be announced soon.",news-medical
