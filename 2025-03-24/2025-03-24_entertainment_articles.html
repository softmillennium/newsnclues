Vittoria Ceretti made rare comments about her relationship with Leonardo DiCaprio.

Ceretti, 26, was asked about her connection to DiCaprio, 50, in an April 2025 cover story for Vogue France.

She met the Oscar winner in Milan but didn't want to go into details about their relationship.

"As soon as you're in a relationship with someone who has a larger following than you, you become 'girlfriend of'—or 'boyfriend of,' for that matter," Ceretti said. 

"And that can be extremely annoying," she added.

Ceretti explained that dating an A-Lister has become a learning experience especially when one person is one of the most popular stars.

"It's something you learn," she said. "If what you're experiencing is real, if you know you love each other, then there's no reason to be alarmed."

DiCaprio and Ceretti have been linked since summer 2023.

The pair were first spotted together multiple times around the world in August 2023.

Months later, Us Weekly confirmed that DiCaprio and Ceretti were "exclusive".

Ceretti was also asked if she had seen DiCaprio's most notable movie, Titanic.

"It's an iconic film… Who hasn't seen it? Or didn't like it?"</p></b><br/><br/></div>

John Lithgow doesn't seem to be losing sleep over landing the iconic role of Professor Albus Dumbledore in the upcoming Harry Potter TV show.

The two-time Academy Award nominee confirmed in February that he was joining HBO's Wizarding World series, based on J.K. Rowling's fantasy novels, as Hogwarts' most powerful sorcerer.

In an interview on the "Smartless" podcast, Lithgow explained that his "deal" to join the Harry Potter show was finalized only 48 hours before the interview.

Lithgow joked about being behind on his Potter reading, saying he was just "halfway through" the second book, 1998's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

The overall concept of this reboot is that an entire season is devoted to a single novel, Lithgow explained.

He admitted it was so early in the development process that he "honestly [didn't] know" all of the details about how much time he'd spend in the U.K. filming the show.

Comparing Harry Potter to his time playing late British Prime Minister Winston Churchill on The Crown, Lithow said, "I mean, I was over in England for eight months for The Crown and barely came back."

Dumbledore was originally played by Richard Harris, who died in 2002, and later by Michael Gambon.

Lithgow received Oscar nominations for 1982's The World According to Garp and 1983's Terms of Endearment.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Juliette Porter is ready to say goodbye to Siesta Key and hello to a summer house in the Hamptons.

She revealed on her "Don't Be Ridiculous" podcast that she tried out Summer House for a moment, but didn't stay.

Porter has met cast member Ciara Miller a couple of times and loves Paige DeSorbo.

Speaking of Paige, Porter expressed pride and admiration for her success, saying "They're the nicest girls. They're so funny and I'm just really proud of their success."

From 2017 to early 2023, Porter starred on Siesta Key alongside other cast members in the Florida city.

The MTV reality show followed a group of friends as they navigated friendships, relationships, and surprises.

Porter explained that she thinks the show ended because "These are my friends from high school through early, early 20s. I don't really talk to them anymore."

She said it was a different era, and things were dying on the show.

The show's fifth and final season was filmed in Miami, but Porter claimed there was a possibility of a new spinoff focused on her life away from the States.

A film crew based out of London filmed Porter in Paris for three days, with positive initial reactions from producers.

Porter called it "magically" and a "spinoff moment," suggesting it could have been a new series.

However, at the last minute, the project was scrapped due to budget concerns.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/maria-shriver-was-consumed-with-grief-after-husbands-affair/'>Maria Shriver Was ‘Consumed With Grief’ After Husband’s Affair</a></h2><b>Source:</b> usmagazine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 21:18:20 <p>
Maria Shriver is opening up about loss and grief in her new book "I Am Maria."

In an excerpt published by People, Shriver, 69, revealed she was unable to get off the floor of her hotel room after learning of her husband Arnold Schwarzenegger's infidelity.

The news came soon after the deaths of both of her parents.

“I was consumed with grief and wracked with confusion, anger, fear, sadness, and anxiety. I was unsure now of who I was, where I belonged. Honestly, it was brutal, and I was terrified,” Shriver wrote.

“As I sat on my hotel room floor in the dark, alone with tears streaming down my face, I thought to myself: Maria, this doesn’t have to be the end of you,” she added.

Shriver found a way to persevere after learning of Schwarzenegger's transgression and filing for divorce in 2011.

The pair were married for 25 years before Shriver learned of Schwarzenegger's infidelity.

Shriver writes that she won’t “bore” readers with “the details of my self-pity party” but does tell one story about going to a cloistered convent.

At the convent, Mother Dolores took Shriver aside and said, “I understand that you like it here very much. But if you’re thinking you can come live with us, let me tell you, you can’t. Our cut-off age is fifty, and you’re fifty-five!”

She also hugged Shriver and they both wept.

Shriver writes in the book, “I’ve made lots of mistakes. One of them was tying my self-worth to my achievements.”

Another big mistake was thinking that someone outside of her could guarantee her safety, worth, and peace.

The divorce from Schwarzenegger, 77, was finalized in December 2021.

Shriver concluded by writing, “I’ve also had to come face to face with other misguided beliefs — about aging, about being alone.”

She used to believe that if you didn’t have a partner, you must be unworthy and unlovable.

“I’ve learned that nothing could be further from the truth,” she wrote.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Lionsgate has axed "Saw XI" from their release calendar, which was scheduled to open on Sept. 26, 2025.

The studio will instead release another horror film, "The Strangers - Chapter 2," on the newly freed date.

It's unclear if Lionsgate plans to unveil "Saw XI" at any point in the future.

A statement from Billy the Puppet, a character from the "Saw" franchise, claims that "the game is never over" and implies that "Saw XI" will be made.

"Saw" has remained a big screen draw for two decades with $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales across 10 films.

The serial killer Jigsaw and his games have been a key part of the series' success.

Lionsgate plans to turn "The Strangers" into a standalone trilogy, separate from the studio's 2008 thriller of the same name.

"The Strangers: Chapter 1" opened in theaters last summer and generated $48 million.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Lionsgate’s Strangers: Chapter Two will open in theaters on Sept. 26, 2025.

The first movie, Strangers: Chapter One, debuted last May, and was one of the better performing movies for Lionsgate, making $35.2M domestic, $48.1M worldwide.


Renny Harlin directs Riverdale's Madelaine Petsch as well as Gabriel Basso and Ema Horvath.

The Strangers movie franchise kicked off in 2008 at Focus Features and starred Liv Tyler in the Bryan Bertino directed and written movie.

That pic followed James Hoyt and Kristen McKay who visit an isolated vacation home only to encounter a rude surprise when three masked assailants make their stay a nightmare.

Denzel Washington may be bringing his version of “Othello” to the screen.

Washington stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the Broadway play, which has been in previews since February 24. The play opened March 23 and runs through June 8. 

Director Kenny Leon is teasing that the historic Shakespeare retelling could lead to a film. Leon told The Hollywood Reporter that there has “absolutely” been talks with Washington about adapting the play into a feature.

Leon previously collaborated with Washington on two other plays, “A Raisin in the Sun” and “Fences,” which Washington then directed the film version of. When asked if Gyllenhaal would also potentially reprise his role for an “Othello” film, Leon said, “I would hope so, absolutely, that’s what I would hope would happen.”

Leon's "Othello" is set in "The Near Future," with Iago (Gyllenhaal) manipulating the titular Othello (Washington) into thinking that his wife, Desdemona (Molly Osborne), is having an affair. 

"It’s important for today because, for 100s of years, we’re still dealing with ourselves. Humanity is still struggling with itself," Leon said. “This play is about pure love but what happens to pure love when there’s rumors and lies and jealousy. And all that’s timely for every generation.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Meghan Markle has launched a new website, ShopMy, where she curates a collection of items she loves.

The Duchess of Sussex announced the launch on her Instagram Story, saying "Many of you have asked, so here you go!"

The website features 30 pieces in Meghan's signature neutral color palette, including wardrobe staples and accessories that can be mixed and matched for endless outfit combinations.

Some items are inspired by her high-low approach to dressing, as seen in her Netflix series With Love, Meghan.

Fans will recognize the $52 button-down chambray shirt and $128 cashmere shell from J.Crew, which were featured in the show.

The $1,415 Lora Piana knit, which sold out during the show's run, is now available on ShopMy for the same price.

Meghan has also sourced near-identical alternatives to some of her favorite items, such as a pair of Zara linen pants and a Jenni Kayne sweater.

The website includes a $99 trench coat from Uniqlo that looks more expensive than it is, in a nod to Meghan's classic style.

Some items on the site are inspired by Meghan's past fashion choices, including a Burberry trench coat she wore during the 2018 Australian royal tour.

Netflix has been sourcing prestige British TV shows with global appeal, which is causing concern among industry experts.

The "existential crisis" facing Britain's public broadcasting was discussed by Peter Kominsky, director of "Wolf Hall," during an interview with BBC Two's Newsnight.


Kominsky stated that American streaming companies have made costs so high that the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5 can't afford to make dramas like "Wolf Hall" anymore.

The money that should be distributed on British programming is going to shows with more global appeal, such as "Adolescence."

Kominsky mentioned that it's unlikely the BBC or ITV would be able to make "Adolescence," which was written by this year's Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay.


"The Mirror and the Light" was almost shut down six weeks before production due to budget constraints.

The show's director, Kominsky, had to solve the problem by shooting most of it indoors to save on costs.

Kominsky and the producer realized that the provided budget wouldn't work, even after props were made, locations scouted, and cast members contracted.


To address this market failure, Kominsky proposed a 5% streaming levy to bring more financing to U.K.-focused narratives.

The profits from this levy would go into a "cultural fund" for British programming without inherent cross-border appeal.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Details have emerged about the death of Miller Gardner, the 14-year-old son of former New York Yankees star Brett Gardner.

Miller died on Friday, March 21, while the family was vacationing at a resort in Costa Rica.

The news was reportedly confirmed by the U.S. Embassy of Costa Rica.

News of Miller’s death was announced in a statement by Brett and his wife, Jessica, released by the Yankees on Sunday, March 23.

“With heavy hearts we are saddened to announce the passing of our youngest son, Miller,” the statement read.

“He was 14 years old and has left us far too soon after falling ill along with several other family members while on vacation.”

“We have so many questions and so few answers at this point, but we do know that he passed away peacefully in his sleep on the morning of Friday, March 21st.”

The statement continued, “Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile.”

“He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day.”

Brett played all 14 seasons of his MLB career with the Yankees before retiring at the end of the 2021 season.

He and Jessica share an older son, Hunter.

The Yankees organization also released their own statement on Sunday after Miller’s death was revealed.

“Our love for the Gardner family is unconditional and absolute, and we will offer our enduring support while understanding their desire for privacy at this time.”

“May Miller rest in peace.”

Yankees general manager Aaron Boone addressed Miller’s death with reporters at the team’s spring training facilities in Tampa, Florida, on Sunday.

“We talk about being family all the time, and even though Brett’s been gone for a few years, that doesn’t stop,” Boone said.

“A lot of people in [the clubhouse] know that family intimately. It’s a very tough day and very tough news.”

Boone added, “As best we can, we’ll be praying for the Gardner family and where we can, offering support.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The next new episode of CBS' FBI will introduce Dani Rhodes, the new agent played by Emily Alabi (Magnum P.I., S.W.A.T.).

FBI this season had been trying to permanently fill the void left by Katherine Renee Kane, whose Special Agent Tiffany Wallace left the team in the Season 7 premiere.

At first, Special Agent Stuart Scola (John Boyd) was assigned a temporary partner who elected not to stick around. In Episode 4, Lisette Olivera began an arc as Syd Ortiz, a Behavioral Analysis Unit agent.


Alabi makes her debut in the Tuesday, April 1 episode, titled “Covered.” When an undercover FBI agent is killed in the field, the team makes the unnerving discovery that the identities of multiple UCs have been compromised — including Maggie, who has been working to infiltrate an eco-terrorist group. The team enlists the help of an agent (Alabi) whose cover was blown, to not only save one of their own but to aid in uncovering who was behind the leak.

Alabi already has some experience in the world of CBS procedurals: She played firefighter Mahina, who became a love interest for T.C., on Magnum P.I.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Jon M. Chu has set the record straight on casting rumors for his Britney Spears biopic.

"We have not had one conversation about casting this movie yet," Chu, 45, confirmed via X on Sunday, March 23.

The Wicked director responded to speculation that Ariana Grande, Sabrina Carpenter, and Millie Bobby Brown were all in the running to play the "Gimme More" singer, 43.

Wicked fans were especially excited about the prospect of Grande potentially reuniting with Chu following their award-winning success with the musical, in which she costarred as Glinda.

However, the filmmaker shot down the rumors entirely by writing on X, "None of this is true. Sounds exciting but have not had one conversation about casting this movie yet. We are way too early in development. Sorry."

Deadline reported in August 2024 that Chu was teaming up with Universal Pictures on a film adaptation of Spears' 2023 New York Times bestselling memoir The Woman in Me.

The memoir detailed Spears' years-long battle to be freed from a conservatorship that controlled her life, both personally and professionally.

Several notable stars have expressed interest in playing Spears, including Brown, 21, revealing on The Drew Barrymore Show in 2022 that she felt passionate about the "Toxic" singer's life story.

"I want to play a real person and I think for me, Britney. [It] would be Britney Spears," Brown told host Drew Barrymore.

Spears seemed less than enthusiastic about Brown's movie pitch, suggesting on Instagram at the time that it was premature to turn her life into a Hollywood film.

"Good news, good news !!! Still breathing … I hear about people wanting to do movies about my life … dude I'm not dead !!" Spears wrote via Instagram in November 2022.

"I guess my family is going to lock their doors now," Spears added.

American Horror Story star Emma Roberts was later recommended by Spears' former assistant, Felicia Culotta, as ideal casting for the movie.

"I love her assistant,'" Roberts, 34, later joked to Cosmopolitan in August 2024.

"I mean, it's my true dream to play Britney Spears," Roberts said.

In January 2025, Chu warned Spears superfans that it would be "a long road" before the biopic was completed because he wanted to ensure authenticity and sensitivity.

The film adaptation of Spears' memoir is still in development.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Sherri Shepherd had a night out on Broadway and didn’t expect to spark a feud with another star.

“We were out, we don’t go out a lot but we were out in the streets last night because we saw the most amazing show on Broadway,” Shepherd said on her talk show. “Last night, we went to the opening of Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal’s show Othello.”

Shepherd was enjoying a nice night out at the theatre, but claimed she was approached by an “unnamed celebrity” and the pair had a tense exchange.

“Let me tell y’all something, I get along with everybody,” she said. “So I’m standing there talking to [Ellis’ wife] Khadeen [Joseph] and [former football player] Devale Ellis and Devale Ellis’ sister.”

Shepherd continued: “So this unnamed celebrity actress — who shall remain nameless — I’m standing there talking [and] somebody grabbed my arms and they forcefully turned me around.”

Shepherd denied shading the anonymous person who allegedly walked away in the middle of the confrontation.

“First of all, I know who I shade because I don’t shade many people,” she said. “It might be one person I shade and I have never shaded this unnamed celebrity.”

After the exchange, Shepherd shared that she was “really mad” and wanted to continue the conversation.

“I went to the bathroom during intermission and I stood there for 15 minutes waiting for a meeting in the ladies’ room,” she shared. 

Shepherd invited the star to appear on her show so they could talk out the issue.

“Come sit on my couch so we can talk about it,” she quipped. “And you know who you are.”

Murray, who witnessed the incident, shared that he had never seen Shepherd so mad before.

He joked that the situation could have turned into a “Broadway battle.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Nathan Lane's star-making turn in "The Birdcage" didn't have as much of an impact as he thought it would.

 
Lane detailed how he lost out on roles, specifically one for "Space Jam", after leading the comedy about a proud queer couple forced back into closet for their heteronormative son and his fiancée's conservative family. He was not prepared to publicly come out as gay when "The Birdcage" was released.

 
Lane later came out in 1999, yet "Space Jam" director Joe Pytka allegedly deemed him "too gay" to star as Michael Jordan's assistant in the film, which was also released in 1996. Wayne Knight instead was cast. Lane told Vanity Fair that he was up for the part and thought it might have played a part in his lack of future film roles.

 
Lane added that his (now former) agent at the time warned him against being out: "Maybe if you weren't so open about your lifestyle, it would have" led to more opportunities. Lane said he left his agent after this conversation. 

 
Director Mike Nichols instead helped Lane find new representation at CAA. Despite this, Lane says that "Hollywood figured out nothing when it comes to me" in terms of casting.

 
Lane has since appeared in more unique fare and thinks he's shifted the perception about him, but there's still a stigma: either homophobia or being seen as too theatrical. He's been fortunate lately, working on series "Mid-Century Modern".</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Hamdan Ballal, one of the co-directors of the Israeli-Palestinian documentary "No Other Land," was attacked by "settlers" while in the West Bank.

A group of settlers just lynched Hamdan Ballal, co-director of our film 'No Other Land.' They beat him and he has injuries in his head and stomach, bleeding. Soldiers invaded the ambulance he called, and took him. No sign of him since.

In a subsequent post written in Hebrew and translated via X, Abraham said, "A group of settlers attacked the home of Hamdan Ballal, who directed the Oscar-winning film 'No Other Land' with me."

The film's other co-director Basel Adra also shared a photo from the scene, saying he was with Ballal's 7-year-old son.

'I'm standing with Karam, Hamdan's 7-year-old son, near the blood of Hamdan's in his house, after settlers lynched him. Hamdan, co-director of our film 'No Other Land,' is still missing after soldiers abducted him, injured and bleeding.

Ballal is a Palestinian photographer and farmer from Susya, which is a settlement in Area C of the West Bank.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Massachusetts subpoenaed financial technology company Robinhood last week seeking information about its new sports event futures trading product available in all 50 states.

It relaunched following behind-the-scenes communication with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). While the federal CFTC is the de facto overseer of futures trading for now, states are now taking a close look at whether platforms such as the one from Robinhood violate state betting laws. Nevada recently sent Kalshi, the exchange that powers Robinhood’s sports event futures, a cease-and-desist letter.

As Reuters was the first to report, Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth Bill Galvin said that the sports futures trading product “is just another gimmick from a company that’s very good at gimmicks to lure investors away from sound investing.”

Robinhood denied wrongdoing. "The event contracts offered by Robinhood Derivatives are regulated by the CFTC and offered through CFTC-registered entities," wrote a company official in an email.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Love Is Blind star Lauren O'Brien dated fellow Netflix star Scott Sanderson six months after her split from Dave Bettenburg.

She revealed this on Us Weekly's exclusive clip from this week's episode of Amanda Hirsch's "Not Skinny But Not Fat" podcast. 

He had reached out to her, and they connected in the pods during Love Is Blind season 8.

Lauren said she wanted to "explore this connection" with Scott before deciding what to do next.

They "talked for a little bit," but didn't take things further without discussing it with Dave first.

Dave was initially fine with Lauren seeing Scott, saying "all good."

However, some people thought it might have been too soon for her to move on from their breakup.

Lauren felt there wasn't anything wrong with exploring a connection six months after breaking up with Dave.

She explained that the pods are designed to find compatible matches, and she didn't know if Scott was "the one" for her.

Things ultimately didn't work out romantically between Lauren and Scott, but they remain friends.

Dave got engaged to Lauren during Love Is Blind season 8, but their relationship started to fracture after meeting in person.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Pete Docter, co-chief creative officer of Pixar, reflects on being part of the "nerds" who revolutionized animation filmmaking with "Toy Story".

The film marks its 30th anniversary this year and was not expected to hit popular culture. Working on it felt like working in a garage due to its small team and casual atmosphere.

Docter is still amazed at the film's legacy, despite feeling that it looks outdated compared to current animation technology.

Thirty years later, "Toy Story" remains one of the top movies on Disney+, with great acting being the key factor in its success. Docter admits that the film's animation appears a bit like a video game now given how far computer animation has come.


The film is credited with shifting the U.S. market for animated films and was part of an effort to create a family-friendly franchise accessible to both kids and adults.

Docter stated that their goal was to bring animation into something enjoyable for 20-30-year-olds, similar to what Spielberg and George Lucas did with "Indiana Jones" and "Star Wars".</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Thousands of fans attended JonasCon, held at American Dream mall in East Rutherford.

 
The event featured several activations set up throughout the mall, including a "listening room" for Joe's new music where fans waited in line to go into a room to hear about five minutes of Joe's new music and get specific merch for the middle sibling. 

Fans could buy T-shirts, hats, beach towels, tote bags, stickers, and other items with Nick, Joe, or Kevin's face at several locations throughout the mall/Con.

 
A giant merch store consistently had a line that was 45+ minutes, with fans telling Us that they spent anywhere from $50 to $300 inside. 

 
The top-selling item was a Teddy Bear sweater that said, "This is my JonasCon sweater" – one woman even bought one in a "youth" size despite being 28 years old because she had to have it.

The event also included a Jonas Brothers escape room, GI Jonas laser tag, and Jonas mini golf. 

 
Outside of the performances, there were several activations set up throughout the mall. Some were already established American Dream activities that were tweaked to be Jonas Brothers-themed. 

 
Fans could indulge in $18 milkshakes named after Jonas Brothers songs or visit the JonasCon Museum with past costumes, records, and a drum set.

 
The night ended with the Jonas Brothers announcing three albums: Joe's solo project, Music for People Who Believe in Love, will be out May 2; a Jonas Brothers live album will drop June 13; and a new album, Greetings From Your Hometown, is expected August 8. 

 
The brothers also announced a new song called "I Can't Lose" will be part of Sunday Night Baseball on ESPN and another song titled "Celebrate Happy" will serve as the soundtrack of Disneyland's 70th anniversary.

 
They confirmed the name of their Disney+ holiday movie (naturally called A Very Jonas Christmas) and teased International JonasCon dates to be announced.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Lizzo will play Sister Rosetta Tharpe in a musical biopic based on Tharpe’s life.

The film, titled “Rosetta,” is currently in development for Amazon MGM Studios.

Sister Rosetta Tharpe began her career in the ’30s with her gospel recordings and gained popularity by the ’40s, one of the first to blend gospel sounds with the electric guitar.

She was among the first to use heavy distortion on her electric guitar and helped pave the way for the classic blues sound.

Tharpe famously toured with Muddy Waters in the ’60s across Europe, inspiring other guitarists like Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, and Jeff Beck.

Rolling Stone named her the sixth best guitarist of all time.

The film specifically focuses on how Tharpe needed to conceal her love for another woman and ultimately hosted her wedding inside a baseball stadium in 1951 in front of 20,000 strangers.

Lizzo is also producing the project alongside Kevin Beisler, Nina Yang Bongiovi, and Forest Whitaker.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.indiewire.com/features/commentary/intermissions-india-filmmakers-cant-stop-them-1235110134/'>Every Hollywood Movie Faces an Intermission in Indian Theaters, and Even Filmmakers Can’t Stop Them</a></h2><b>Source:</b> indiewire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 18:00:00 <p>
Martin Scorsese wanted "Killers of the Flower Moon" to be experienced in one unbroken stretch, but Indian theaters did not follow his vision.

Though the word "Intermission" is not explicitly flashed on the screen during showings of Hollywood movies in India, Indians are accustomed to this time-honored tradition of forced intervals. 

Every Hollywood movie released in Indian theaters has a mid-screening intermission, including Christopher Nolan's "Oppenheimer" and James Cameron's "Avatar: The Way of Water."

For Western audiences, this abrupt pause may seem like a momentum-killer or even sacrilegious. For Indian audiences, it's part of their cinematic experience.

Akkshay Rathie, film exhibitor and director of Ashirwad Theatres, said that the food and beverage sales account for almost 30-40 percent of cinema's revenue in India.

In India, a lack of intermissions could mean a loss to business. Theater owners consider these few minutes as prime-time advertising slots: appealing, lucrative, and short.

Rathie added that movie-watching is centered around the intermission, which aligns with the country's unique theater-going experience.

Devang Sampat, managing director of Cinepolis India, said that exhibitors strive to find a natural pause that aligns with the film's rhythm.

However, the audience may not always be aligned. For movies such as "Dunkirk" and "Joker: Folie à Deux," theaters received complaints and requests to shift the interval timing.

Christopher Nolan has long advocated for his films to be experienced without any interruptions, but even Nolan's movies were not spared in India.

Rathie said that exceptions could be made if a major, Oscar-winning Hollywood director or studio had a clear directive. 

However, exhibitors are unlikely to comply as it is seen as impractical to hold audiences captive without a break.

Sampat echoed a similar sentiment; "There have been cases where studios or directors have expressed a preference for an uninterrupted screening."

Recent films such as "Dune: Part Two," "Gladiator II," "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga," and "Wicked" stretching beyond the two-and-half-hour mark have led industry insiders to feel that Indian audiences are accustomed to intermissions.

Rathie added that many Hollywood studios have accepted this as a part of the localization process and the country's unique theater-going experience.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
