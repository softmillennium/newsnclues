Vittoria Ceretti made rare comments about her relationship with Leonardo DiCaprio.

Ceretti, 26, was asked about her connection to DiCaprio, 50, in an April 2025 cover story for Vogue France.

She met the Oscar winner in Milan but didn't want to go into details about their relationship.

"As soon as you're in a relationship with someone who has a larger following than you, you become 'girlfriend of'—or 'boyfriend of,' for that matter," Ceretti said. 

"And that can be extremely annoying," she added.

Ceretti explained that dating an A-Lister has become a learning experience especially when one person is one of the most popular stars.

"It's something you learn," she said. "If what you're experiencing is real, if you know you love each other, then there's no reason to be alarmed."

DiCaprio and Ceretti have been linked since summer 2023.

The pair were first spotted together multiple times around the world in August 2023.

Months later, Us Weekly confirmed that DiCaprio and Ceretti were "exclusive".

Ceretti was also asked if she had seen DiCaprio's most notable movie, Titanic.

"It's an iconic film… Who hasn't seen it? Or didn't like it?"</p></b><br/><br/></div>

John Lithgow doesn't seem to be losing sleep over landing the iconic role of Professor Albus Dumbledore in the upcoming Harry Potter TV show.

The two-time Academy Award nominee confirmed in February that he was joining HBO's Wizarding World series, based on J.K. Rowling's fantasy novels, as Hogwarts' most powerful sorcerer.

In an interview on the "Smartless" podcast, Lithgow explained that his "deal" to join the Harry Potter show was finalized only 48 hours before the interview.

Lithgow joked about being behind on his Potter reading, saying he was just "halfway through" the second book, 1998's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

The overall concept of this reboot is that an entire season is devoted to a single novel, Lithgow explained.

He admitted it was so early in the development process that he "honestly [didn't] know" all of the details about how much time he'd spend in the U.K. filming the show.

Comparing Harry Potter to his time playing late British Prime Minister Winston Churchill on The Crown, Lithow said, "I mean, I was over in England for eight months for The Crown and barely came back."

Dumbledore was originally played by Richard Harris, who died in 2002, and later by Michael Gambon.

Lithgow received Oscar nominations for 1982's The World According to Garp and 1983's Terms of Endearment.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Juliette Porter is ready to say goodbye to Siesta Key and hello to a summer house in the Hamptons.

She revealed on her "Don't Be Ridiculous" podcast that she tried out Summer House for a moment, but didn't stay.

Porter has met cast member Ciara Miller a couple of times and loves Paige DeSorbo.

Speaking of Paige, Porter expressed pride and admiration for her success, saying "They're the nicest girls. They're so funny and I'm just really proud of their success."

From 2017 to early 2023, Porter starred on Siesta Key alongside other cast members in the Florida city.

The MTV reality show followed a group of friends as they navigated friendships, relationships, and surprises.

Porter explained that she thinks the show ended because "These are my friends from high school through early, early 20s. I don't really talk to them anymore."

She said it was a different era, and things were dying on the show.

The show's fifth and final season was filmed in Miami, but Porter claimed there was a possibility of a new spinoff focused on her life away from the States.

A film crew based out of London filmed Porter in Paris for three days, with positive initial reactions from producers.

Porter called it "magically" and a "spinoff moment," suggesting it could have been a new series.

However, at the last minute, the project was scrapped due to budget concerns.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/maria-shriver-was-consumed-with-grief-after-husbands-affair/'>Maria Shriver Was ‘Consumed With Grief’ After Husband’s Affair</a></h2><b>Source:</b> usmagazine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 21:18:20 <p>
Maria Shriver is opening up about loss and grief in her new book "I Am Maria."

In an excerpt published by People, Shriver, 69, revealed she was unable to get off the floor of her hotel room after learning of her husband Arnold Schwarzenegger's infidelity.

The news came soon after the deaths of both of her parents.

“I was consumed with grief and wracked with confusion, anger, fear, sadness, and anxiety. I was unsure now of who I was, where I belonged. Honestly, it was brutal, and I was terrified,” Shriver wrote.

“As I sat on my hotel room floor in the dark, alone with tears streaming down my face, I thought to myself: Maria, this doesn’t have to be the end of you,” she added.

Shriver found a way to persevere after learning of Schwarzenegger's transgression and filing for divorce in 2011.

The pair were married for 25 years before Shriver learned of Schwarzenegger's infidelity.

Shriver writes that she won’t “bore” readers with “the details of my self-pity party” but does tell one story about going to a cloistered convent.

At the convent, Mother Dolores took Shriver aside and said, “I understand that you like it here very much. But if you’re thinking you can come live with us, let me tell you, you can’t. Our cut-off age is fifty, and you’re fifty-five!”

She also hugged Shriver and they both wept.

Shriver writes in the book, “I’ve made lots of mistakes. One of them was tying my self-worth to my achievements.”

Another big mistake was thinking that someone outside of her could guarantee her safety, worth, and peace.

The divorce from Schwarzenegger, 77, was finalized in December 2021.

Shriver concluded by writing, “I’ve also had to come face to face with other misguided beliefs — about aging, about being alone.”

She used to believe that if you didn’t have a partner, you must be unworthy and unlovable.

“I’ve learned that nothing could be further from the truth,” she wrote.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/saw-xi-removed-release-calendar-1236346843/'>‘Saw XI’ Taken Off 2025 Release Calendar</a></h2><b>Source:</b> indiewire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 21:06:06 <p>
Lionsgate has axed "Saw XI" from their release calendar, which was scheduled to open on Sept. 26, 2025.

The studio will instead release another horror film, "The Strangers - Chapter 2," on the newly freed date.

It's unclear if Lionsgate plans to unveil "Saw XI" at any point in the future.

A statement from Billy the Puppet, a character from the "Saw" franchise, claims that "the game is never over" and implies that "Saw XI" will be made.

"Saw" has remained a big screen draw for two decades with $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales across 10 films.

The serial killer Jigsaw and his games have been a key part of the series' success.

Lionsgate plans to turn "The Strangers" into a standalone trilogy, separate from the studio's 2008 thriller of the same name.

"The Strangers: Chapter 1" opened in theaters last summer and generated $48 million.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Lionsgate’s Strangers: Chapter Two will open in theaters on Sept. 26, 2025.

The first movie, Strangers: Chapter One, debuted last May, and was one of the better performing movies for Lionsgate, making $35.2M domestic, $48.1M worldwide.


Renny Harlin directs Riverdale's Madelaine Petsch as well as Gabriel Basso and Ema Horvath.

The Strangers movie franchise kicked off in 2008 at Focus Features and starred Liv Tyler in the Bryan Bertino directed and written movie.

That pic followed James Hoyt and Kristen McKay who visit an isolated vacation home only to encounter a rude surprise when three masked assailants make their stay a nightmare.

Watch on Deadline (Removed)

Ten years later, there was a sequel, The Strangers: Prey at Night which Johannes Roberts directed off a script by Bertino and Ben Ketai.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
