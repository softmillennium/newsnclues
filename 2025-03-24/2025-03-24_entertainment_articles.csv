After the lights went down in the Kennedy Center Concert Hall on March 23 to signal the beginning of the Mark Twain Prize ceremony, an announcer on the PA system explained that the Kennedy Center — recently taken over by President Donald J. Trump, who stacked the board of directors with Trump loyalists who voted him in as board president — has become an arts venue more reflective of “American values.” “This vaunted stage will now showcase distinguished, elegant, and revered entertainment that we, as a nation, can be proud of,” the announcer said, at which time a bear wearing a diaper walked onstage and began to jerk himself off to the tune of the classical composition “Sabre Dance.”

Yes, the two-and-a-half-hour tribute to the most famous six-foot-four American redhead to have hosted The Tonight Show for less than seven months began with a performance by the Masturbating Bear, a character made famous on Late Night With Conan O’Brien, the first and most influential of O’Brien’s three late-night talk shows. It was simultaneously absurd and an expression of affection for the gonzo mayhem that has been central to O’Brien’s comedic sensibility for the past three decades or so.

It also, perhaps, sent a sly message of resistance. Those who remember the period in 2010 when Jay Leno essentially snatched his Tonight Show gig back from O’Brien will recall that when O’Brien stepped down from his NBC late-night perch, he was initially told he did not have the rights to the various characters created during his tenure on the network, including the Masturbating Bear. If one squinted a little at that creature going to town on himself on the Kennedy Center Concert Hall stage, one could see an attempt to acknowledge the current political moment by reaffirming that free speech ultimately can’t be suppressed by corporations and/or political leaders. Maybe?

If that weren’t the intent of the Masturbating Bear kickoff — which was immediately followed by Robert Smigel as Triumph the Insult Comic Dog declaring, “Thanks so much for coming, and also shame on you for being here. That should cover it, yes?” — it certainly seemed to be a guiding principle of an evening in which the assembled lineup of comedians acknowledged the Republican elephants in the room without letting the political commentary overshadow the main reason everyone was there: to revel in the intelligent-yet-relentlessly-silly lunacy that O’Brien has unleashed on television as an SNL and Simpsons writer as well as celebrate his place as one of the greatest late-night-talk-show hosts of all time over the past 30-plus years.

Despite all the uncertainty hanging over the Kennedy Center at a moment when Trump and his administration are attempting to exert control over an institution embraced by a largely liberal community, this Mark Twain ceremony, which will start streaming on May 4 on Netflix, did not feel all that different from previous ones. There were no protests in front of or inside the Center, at least that this writer could see. No one publicly boycotted the event, nor was the ceremony in any way disrupted.

The anti-Trump calls instead came from inside the Concert Hall, where, with few exceptions, every famous funny person who sang O’Brien’s praises during the program fired at least one shot at the Trump administration and/or the new Washington Establishment. David Letterman, who presented the Mark Twain statuette to O’Brien at the end of the ceremony, called the night “the most entertaining gathering of the resistance ever.” Other presenters included Sarah Silverman, Bill Burr, Will Ferrell, longtime Conan sidekick Andy Richter, John Mulaney, Tracy Morgan, Kumail Nanjiani, Nikki Glaser, Adam Sandler, Reggie Watts, and Stephen Colbert, who ate increasingly spicy chicken wings — “right wings,” he emphasized — during a bit with Hot Ones host Sean Evans.

“It’s an honor to be here at the Kennedy Center, or, as it will be known next week, the Roy Cohn Pavilion for Big Strong Men Who Love Cats,” said Mulaney, the evening’s first presenter, who congratulated O’Brien later in his speech for “receiving the 26th and final Mark Twain Prize.” Ferrell, a frequent and deliberately unhinged guest on all of O’Brien’s shows, fake-screamed at O’Brien for promising that he would never accept the Mark Twain Prize out of respect for the star of Anchorman, who received it in 2011. “I don’t have time for this,” Ferrell asserted. “I’m supposed to be shutting down the Department of Education.”

“Nothing says comedy like the free-flowing, creative vibes of the District of Columbia,” deadpanned Burr. “I don’t know what it is. There’s something about starting and prolonging wars while crushing the workingman for your own self-interest that really inspires all who gather on this fertile ground.” Glaser, the other comedic figure who crushed an awards-show hosting gig this season and was immediately invited back to host again, as O’Brien was with the Oscars, did a political bit with a classic ridiculous character from O’Brien’s late-night years, the Interrupter, played by one of his writers, Brian Stack:

Glaser: “Don’t you have a —”

The Interrupter: “Cabinet meeting to get to?”

Glaser: “Wait, so you’re the new —”

The Interrupter: “Director of Housing and Urban Development?”

Glaser: “Even though you —”

The Interrupter: “Never even lived in a house.”

Glaser: “And you’re also —”

The Interrupter: “A registered sex offender.”

Glaser: “Which this administration actually considers —”

The Interrupter: “A massive plus.”

But no one punched up as forcefully as Silverman, who recalled how she, a famously Jewish comedian, appeared in character as Adolf Hitler defending himself from comparisons to Donald Trump on an episode of TBS’s Conan. “I am actually not an obvious choice for Hitler,” Silverman explained. “I mean, I am an obvious choice for Hitler, but I’m not an obvious choice to play him. But they chose me, and it’s this way of thinking that makes Conan great again.” As she looked up at O’Brien seated in a box with his family, she added, “I really miss the days when you were America’s only orange asshole.”

Silverman then recalled another bit she did on Conan, in which she took a picture of O’Brien’s lips that revealed how much, in close-up, they look like a vagina. On cable television, the cell-phone image between her legs was pixilated, but now that the Mark Twain Prize will stream on Netflix, Silverman felt liberated to reveal what that uncensored image actually looks like — to the point where she had placed printouts of it beneath many of the Kennedy Center’s attendees’ seats and urged patrons to pick them up and place them between their legs. “If you can go ahead and keep those photos on your seat when you go, the guy who took over loves grabbing pussy,” she added. (In a double play of sorts, Silverman also managed to sneak in a Louis C.K. joke. “Not all redheaded comedians can endear themselves to us through public masturbation,” she said, referring to O’Brien’s Masturbating Bear gag. “I have had another friend who tried it, and it did not work.”)

As abundant as the Trump jokes were, albeit largely without mentioning Trump’s name, the evening struck an appropriate balance between commenting on the current political moment and celebrating the largely apolitical and certifiably silly history of O’Brien’s comedy. For the hardcore members of Team Coco, there were plenty of references to the bits most beloved by fans. In addition to appearances by the Masturbating Bear, the Interrupter, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, and O’Brien’s original house band, the Max Weinberg 7, which played throughout the event, the presenters and prerecorded clips featured homages to Pimpbot 5000; the Late Night With Conan O’Brien effort to track down Whitman Mayo, the actor who played Grady Wilson on Sanford and Son; the FedEx Pope; that Walker, Texas Ranger scene in which a young Haley Joel Osment abruptly announces that he has AIDS; and, in a special video starring Paul Rudd, not one but two replays of that scene from the movie Mac and Me that Rudd has repeatedly forced O’Brien to play since 2004.

There were plenty of sincere moments, too. Mulaney and Nanjiani both called O’Brien their hero. (In a TED Talk–style presentation, Nanjiani noted that O’Brien’s name is mentioned on the internet 93 percent of the time when people talk about Simpsons writers, even though he actually has a writing credit on just three out of the long-running sitcom’s 781 episodes. “The names of the Simpsons episodes that Conan wrote are ‘Marge vs. the Monorail’ and two other episodes,” Nanjiani said.) O’Brien’s longtime friend Adam Sandler — whose familiar, gravelly voice shouted “Conan!” into the darkness just before the ceremony began — recalled how happy he was for his SNL buddy when he got the call to host the 12:30 a.m. late-night slot that once belonged to Letterman. “Everyone was going, ‘Who’s it gonna be? Who’s it gonna be?’ Right when they said Conan, I swear to God — every fucking guy, every comedian — there was no jealousy. We were like, ‘Fuck yeah! He’s the best, man!’ We loved you. You’re faster than all of us. You’re nicer than all of us. And I’m so happy this life was yours, buddy.”

The so-called “most entertaining gathering of the resistance” ultimately expressed itself most eloquently when it was O’Brien’s turn to speak. After thanking his wife, kids, and late parents, who “missed witnessing this by three months” (they died in December within three days of each other), O’Brien expressed his gratitude toward former Kennedy Center chairman David Rubenstein and president Deborah Rutter, “the people who invited me here several months ago,” before they were both dismissed from their positions after Trump’s takeover. “A special thanks,” he continued, “to all the beautiful people who have worked here at the Kennedy Center for years and who are worried about what the future might bring. My eternal thanks for their selfless devotion to the arts.” That comment drew the loudest, most sustained standing ovation of the night.

O’Brien then noted the qualities that made Twain such a great humorist and American: his hatred of bullies, his interest in comedy that punched up rather than down, and his fervent opposition to racism. “Twain was suspicious of populism, jingoism, imperialism, the money-obsessed mania of the Gilded Age, and any expression of mindless American might or self-importance,” O’Brien said. “Above all, Twain was a patriot in the best sense of the word. He loved America but knew it was deeply flawed. Twain wrote, ‘Patriotism is supporting your country all of the time and your government when it deserves it.’” That last quote was the same one that Letterman, who presented O’Brien with his Mark Twain Prize, cited when he received the award in 2017, shortly after Trump was elected to his first term.

The night was capped off by O’Brien performing “Rockin’ in the Free World,” by Neil Young, one of his musical idols, while joined on guitar by Sandler. Young filed a lawsuit against Trump for using the song without permission during his rallies, a case he dropped in 2020. Last year, the singer gave Democratic vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz full permission to use the song on the campaign trail. Was O’Brien thinking about this when he chose to make the song the night’s closer? Unclear. But as he jammed while surrounded by a dozen dancing Mark Twains, including SNL vet Will Forte, the joyful noise invited everyone, for a moment, to do the same thing O’Brien urged us to do when he signed off as Tonight Show host 15 years ago: not to be cynical.",vulture

Michelle Williams was winding up to kick Rob Delaney in the dick. They were on a soundstage in Brooklyn decorated to look like a typical New York apartment, both grinning and audibly panting. Williams was fully clothed, wrapped in a scarf and sweater; Delaney was wearing only underwear and what he describes as a “fascinating harness” — a protective bowl of sorts, “invented by some sicko” — that sat “eight or nine inches below my real gear.” Though Delaney was more physically exposed and in more imminent bodily danger, Williams had the more difficult emotional task: playing a woman who is just now, in her 40s, figuring out that she likes to dominate men and is simultaneously horrified, delighted, and confused by the sheer fact of her desire as well as by the idea that she is allowed to act upon it. Oh, and this woman is on the verge of death. Also, this is based on a true story. And it’s a comedy.

“I want to hit you and kick you in the dick and destroy you,” said Williams, spitting out her lines like bad coffee. “Do it,” said Delaney, eyes wild with lust, miming masturbation. “Kick me in the dick. Please.” Her face was an amalgam of horny disbelief and disgust. She backed up to kick him, connected hard. The “kick-in-the-nuts approximator,” as Delaney describes it, was close enough to his testicles that he could feel her hitting it in real time and react appropriately. Both fell to the floor — Delaney groaning in ecstasy, Williams screaming in agony. Her character, a stage-four breast-cancer patient, has snapped a bone in her leg and needs to be rushed to the hospital.

They shot the scene over and over for half a day, which meant at least “nine or ten kicks to the nuts,” Delaney says. “We rode the hell out of that thing.” Williams remembers the day as “nerve-racking.” “But I don’t think I hurt him​,” she adds.

In This Issue Michelle Williams Stars in the Kinkiest Show on TV See All

Nearly every moment of Dying for Sex — an FX limited series based on the hit 2020 podcast of the same name, itself based on the life of Molly Kochan, who hosted the podcast with her best friend, Nikki Boyer — feels both funny and shattering. The eight-episode show, premiering April 4 on Hulu, kicks off at a couples-therapy session during which Williams’s smart, put-together, and deeply sexually repressed Molly gets a call from her doctor with a terminal diagnosis. She stands up, immediately leaves the session and her mediocre husband (Jay Duplass, perfectly condescending), meets up with Nikki (a transcendent Jenny Slate), tells her she’s going to die, and later asks Nikki if she can “die with her” instead of within the claustrophobic confines of her marriage. Nikki absorbs and accepts the proposal, and while under her care, Molly embarks upon a frantic sex quest with the express goal of figuring out what actually turns her on — and if she can orgasm with another person — before she dies.

Co-creators and co-showrunners Liz Meriwether and Kim Rosenstock met working in theater in New York in the early aughts and went on to collaborate on Meriwether’s long-running hit sitcom New Girl. Rosenstock started writing the Dying for Sex pilot a few months after COVID hit. It was all as heavy as you may imagine. “It asked me to reckon with my own mortality and think about the kind of life I wanted for my daughter and the relationship I wanted her to have with her body,” recalls Rosenstock. They had no direct points of comparison narratively or tonally (though they kept thinking about the ruthlessly honest, bleakly funny I May Destroy You and the hot, realistic sex in Normal People). They had no idea if what they were doing would translate to FX execs or to an audience or even if they could make something they thought was good. “We would kind of all look around at each other and be like, ‘Is this okay?’” says Rosenstock. “‘I think so. Let’s hope so. Let’s just keep going.’”

“The show careened from dramatic to absurd to hilarious to unbelievable and then back again. I was just sort of wondering what the tone would be. And nobody gave me an answer,” Williams says, laughing. It’s late February, and we’re wedged into a corner at Inga’s Bar, one of her favorite restaurants near her Brooklyn Heights home, where she asks to meet for both of our conversations and where nobody really seems to recognize her, though we do bump into Alison Roman wearing her new baby. (Williams recommends a butt salve — “not for adults.”) Williams and Meriwether are identically dressed in white sweaters and jeans. They both want to order something called “tender lettuces,” which we all agree is thematically resonant. The show could only have starred Williams, Meriwether says: “We needed the Simone Biles of acting.”

Dying for Sex comes at a fascinating time. We’re living under an openly fascistic government whose express goal is to wrench any remaining agency, sexual or otherwise, from anyone who is not a white man with an upsetting hairline. Yet we’re suddenly surrounded by stories, fictional or otherwise, about women over 40 fucking their way to self-actualization: Miranda July’s All Fours, the Nicole Kidman–led MILF renaissance, a deluge of pro-divorce memoirs, a recent New York Times Magazine piece about how Gen-X women are having better sex than anyone else. On paper, Dying for Sex shouldn’t work as well as it does, rife as it is with opportunities for maudlin sentimentality. But Meriwether and Rosenstock have managed to make something truly novel. It’s casually groundbreaking in its treatment of heterosexual sex; its protagonist has sex with multiple men largely without vaginal penetration, a choice that stands in direct opposition to most of the show’s thrust-loving American television forebears. It explores kink as an opportunity for liberation and catharsis,not as a punch line or dark Freudian detour on the way to conventional sex. It doesn’t shy from the visceral realities of what happens to a human being as she dies — the sounds, the way time slows and distorts. It’s proudly weird and theatrical, featuring a hallucinatory dream-ballet sequence complete with custom puppets, one of which is a hyperrealistic penis outfitted with fairy wings.

“It definitely opened my eyes in a way that was also like, God, I’m such a dummy for not having realized this stuff sooner,” Williams says about how the show influenced her feelings about sex. “There was something about Molly choosing to continue to feel, and how painful that choice is — to feel things when you know you’re not going to be able to feel for much longer,” adds Meriwether. “I think about that a lot.”

“That’s why sex is an answer to death. Because it’s the ultimate feeling before we’re left without any,” says Williams. She jokingly slaps the table for emphasis. “I got to go home and see my husband!” she says, laughing as she stands up.

Williams, who has been working consistently since she paddled into Dawson’s Creek at age 16, has long proved her ability to play women navigating all manner of existential and literal crises; she has had far fewer opportunities to be funny. Her comedic turns — such as in the underrated ’90s Watergate satire Dick — were memorable enough that Meriwether and Rosenstock knew she could handle the show’s slapstick physicality, the endless quips, the tonal whiplash. Plus Williams looks uncannily like Kochan, especially during Kochan’s final years: short blonde hair, model bone structure, expressive eyes.

Williams, Meriwether, and Rosenstock all Zoomed in 2022. Before they spoke, Williams, who had most recently worked on The Fabelmans, had listened to the podcast, which Boyer and Kochan recorded together from the beginning of Kochan’s sexual escapades through her final months. It moves from the two giggling and gossiping about Kochan peeing in a man’s mouth or giving a surreptitious hospital-bed blowjob to something more profound with Kochan reflecting on her changing relationship to herself, her sexuality, her mother, and her childhood sexual trauma, all while coming to terms with her mortality. “It destroyed me,” Williams says of the podcast. “It’s not often that you get such a strong emotional reaction. You like things, you can admire things, you can be provoked by things. But to be just obliterated by something? I can’t know when I last had that experience.” She “cried and blubbered” after listening to it, then listened to it again. “I was like, What just happened to me? Things don’t usually get to me like that. And I was like, I need to respect the fact that something in me that I’m not really capable of verbalizing at the moment is drawn to something in this.” When I ask her to name what exactly she couldn’t shake, she thinks for at least a minute. “It’s human bravery,” she says finally. “I think that’s the thing that gets me about it. Bravery, in the midst of the most impossible circumstances, to do something your own way.”

She didn’t sign on immediately — originally, the show was set in Los Angeles, which would have meant a temporary move. “When you have small children, you become thoughtful about the time you spend away from them. And so I don’t work a ton, but I still want to work,” Williams says. She agreed to read the next few scripts when they were ready. “It wasn’t necessarily the thing that I saw myself doing. I’m a mom. I got all these kids,” she admits, spearing a tender lettuce. “I’m going to go do a show about what?”

Then she got pregnant. She stepped back from the project in 2022, had her third child, and recorded the audiobook for Britney Spears’s The Woman in Me. In the meantime, Meriwether and Rosenstock continued to work with a writers’ room comprised of five women, one nonbinary person, and one man and wrote the next few episodes. When they emerged 20 weeks later, they set out to get Williams again. “She’s our dream,” says Meriwether. “And we were like, ‘How do we get our dream back?’”

Early the next year, Meriwether ran into Williams at the 2023 Critics Choice Awards. Williams was with her best friend, Busy Philipps, whom Meriwether also knew. She anxiously approached them, telling Williams, “I’m moving to New York, and I would still love for you to do this. We have more scripts.” Williams thought about it. She hadn’t worked in a while and was getting the itch. “I was like, I know I had a baby, but two and a half years is retired,” she says. “This is getting crazy.” Her eldest, Matilda, was obsessed with New Girl (“We kind of raised her together,” she jokes to Meriwether) and really wanted her to do it. “To go make a show about sex and death with so many unknown elements, you really do need the support of your home team to say, ‘Go, Mom, go,’” Williams says.

A year and change later, Williams was trying to figure out how to fake an orgasm six different ways. It was one of her first days on the Dying for Sex set, and she was filming a scene in which, just after Molly leaves her husband, she gets a hotel room and a vibrator and masturbates for an entire day in an attempt to figure out what turns her on, eventually dumping the overheated vibrator into an ice bucket. “You’ve already done, like, four scenes, and then it’s five o’clock at night and you have to do six masturbation sequences with six sculpted, individuated orgasms,” recalls Williams wryly. “And you’re like, ‘Woo! Okay.’” Meriwether, Rosenstock, and the intimacy coordinator were standing by on set to offer notes. “We talked about how realistic each orgasm was,” says Meriwether. “How one should sneak up on you, how the last should be like finishing a marathon.” Williams was game but nervous. “I just kept joking, like, ‘Just so you know, this is how Molly comes, not Michelle,’” says Williams. “This is not my come face.”

In Montana, where Williams grew up, her own sex education was nearly nonexistent. “We were given a tiny bottle of Clearasil for our acne and then told how to put a condom on. That was puberty. Sex can kill you or make you pregnant. No one ever talked about pleasure,” she says. “I think I still struggle with it. I’m still a little embarrassed about it or not sure how to talk about it.” Meriwether and Rosenstock invited Emily Nagoski, the writer of Come As You Are, a book about female desire, to speak to the writers’ room. “In her book, she talks about the No. 1 question she gets asked: ‘Am I normal?’” says Meriwether. “I don’t know if it’s an American thing or not, but I just think that’s this deep fear for so many people, and there’s so much shame here around it.” Kochan, alternatively, “was this force of acceptance” around sex, adds Meriwether.

On the show, Molly tries everything she can think of to get herself off: chatting with a cam-boy, watching the scene from Speed when Sandra Bullock gets to drive the bus, observing clown fish going in and out of a coral reef. The last was related to a New York Times article Williams read about how women, uniquely, can be turned on by almost anything. Meriwether, Rosenstock, and Williams were all riveted by the way Kochan discovered exactly what brought her pleasure. The show expresses this via Molly’s slow opening to various types of sex and intimacy but also via Sonya, her queer, sex-positive palliative-care social worker played with charisma and empathy by Esco Jouléy. Sonya becomes a sort of kink doula for Molly, easing her into new notions of eroticism. During one conversation from her hospital bed, Molly laments to Sonya that she “can’t even have normal orgasms from normal sex” and then says, “I made my neighbor jerk off in front of me while I said truly horrible things about his penis and then I kicked him in the dick. I loved it,” sounding despondent. “I don’t want to have to hurt people to have orgasms. What’s wrong with me?”

Sonya laughs. “Nothing the fuck is wrong with you. You early millennials are so tragic. You think sex is just penetration and orgasms. Why? Because that’s what Samantha said? Sex is a wave. Sex is a mind-set,” Sonya says. Molly is rapt. “Here’s the thing about your body,” Sonya concludes. “You have to listen to it. Yes, maybe it’s saying something you don’t want or you don’t understand. But give it a chance and listen to it.” Shortly after, Sonya brings Molly to a kink-forward “sex-party potluck,” where Molly is entranced by the possibilities of BDSM. Her eyes widen as she watches a live domination-and-submission scene. “That’s what I want,” Molly whispers.

Meriwether, Rosenstock, and director Shannon Murphy wanted to avoid the pitfalls of Fifty Shades of Grey–type movie sex, in which everyone is clean and hairless and often being manipulated into doing things like having a spoonful of ice cream fed into their vagina. Dying for Sex features scenes of joyful BDSM negotiation — in one scene, over coffee, a chipper finance bro asks Molly if she’s “into cock cages” as he outlines his own boundaries. “So when did you figure out that you liked orgasm torture?” asks Molly. “Probably when I was canvassing for Obama,” he replies. “No bruises. I work in finance. But I do want you to step on me, and I’m into penis humiliation.” Williams is never nude onscreen, something they all agreed upon as a choice that felt natural; in real life, Kochan often wore a bra during sex. (There is, however, a delightful preponderance of dicks on the series, so many that FX asked them at one point to pull back on the male full-frontal just slightly.) Their primary goal was to make sure the joke is never on the person or the sexual act itself, to make it all feel real while being genuinely funny. Whereas on other shows, like Industry or Sex and the City, peeing on someone as a form of kink is used to implicitly make fun of or pathologize the character, on Dying for Sex, it’s presented as playful, an opportunity for sexual creativity. Molly invites a man dressed as a puppy to her apartment, gamely brings him into the bathtub, and straddles cheerfully over his face to pee on him. Later, he marvels at her sexual improvisational skills: “I’ve never had someone check me for ticks before. How did you think of that?”

A week later, I’m sitting in another restaurant across the country, this time with the real-life Nikki Boyer. We’re at Hugo’s in Studio City, Los Angeles, the last place she ever ate lunch with Kochan. This week marks the sixth anniversary of Kochan’s death, and as Boyer recalls their decadeslong friendship, she cries often, easily, and unself-consciously, without apologizing or really even acknowledging it. “Sometimes I feel like I’m talking for her and I’m trying to make sense of her. I think I’m probably the best person to do it, but still,” she says. “Maybe she’d be like, ‘No, bitch, that is not what I …’” She pauses and shakes her head. “No. I think she’d be like, ‘That’s okay. That’s not really what I think, but that’s okay. I love you anyway.’” She twists a ring around her finger. “This is her ring I’m wearing.”

Kochan, then 26, and Boyer, then 24, met in an acting class in Los Angeles in 1999. They didn’t warm to each other right away. Kochan was envious of Boyer, a St. Louis transplant who was boisterous, flirty, and determined to use the class as an opportunity to network and eventually make a name for herself as an actor. Kochan, who’d moved to L.A. from New York somewhat recently, saw acting as more of a hobby; she wanted to make her mark on the world in some way, maybe through writing, but didn’t quite know how. Boyer thought Kochan was quiet and reserved but intriguing. “There was something about her long brown hair and her crystal-blue eyes,” she says. “I used to call her an alien model because she just has such a cool, interesting face.” They were paired for a scene study and eventually became best friends, spending the next several years having six-hour lunches, watching movies, and telling each other their deepest secrets. Their friendship was instantaneously intimate, emotionally and physically. Kochan, who ultimately had to get a bilateral mastectomy, used Boyer’s boobs as the model for her own reconstructive surgery. In a scene from Dying for Sex that Boyer says came from real life, Molly casually holds Nikki’s breasts as they chat in bed, describing them lovingly as a “cup of hot tea.” In the early years of their friendship, Kochan, who Boyer thinks was living off a bit of family money and wasn’t working full time, would ask to accompany Boyer on errands and to auditions, help her run lines, prep for jobs, and go with her to pick up family members at the airport. “She was such a great participant in life. She was like, ‘I just want to be with you,’” says Boyer.

In 2005, Kochan noticed a small lump in her breast and asked her OB/GYN about it. He dismissed her, telling her it was nothing and that she was too young to worry about cancer. She felt embarrassed for bringing it up. Six years later, the lump had grown big enough for her to ask another doctor about it. By then, the cancer had spread beyond her breasts to her lymph nodes. She underwent chemo, a bilateral mastectomy, radiation, and later breast reconstruction, and she began hormone therapy, all while trying to carry on as normal a personal life as possible. The hormones pumping into her made her as horny as a teenager, but her husband struggled to see her as a sexual being now that she was sick. They went to therapy and tried to figure it out. Then, in 2015, her hip started hurting — the cancer had returned, this time in her bones, liver, and brain. Her doctor told her she was going to die. About a month later, she began having cybersex with strangers.

Kochan bought sexy lingerie, snapped nudes, sent graphic sexts across international lines. She couldn’t quite explain what she was doing or why she was doing it, at first. But it filled her with purpose and pleasure, a new sense of herself. Within a year, she had left her husband. “I love my husband, but we weren’t really a romantic fit,” she explains on an early episode of the Dying for Sex podcast. “I don’t think that I can self-realize in the context of this marriage for many reasons — so I left.” Kochan quickly transferred her sexual adventures from the digital realm into the physical. She was open to trying anything: tickling, foot fetishes, domination, and going to a man’s house to have sex in the morning on a weekday. The sex was unlike any she’d ever had. In Screw Cancer: Becoming Whole, her posthumous memoir, which Boyer self-published, she writes about how penetrative vaginal sex had, throughout her life, been “an easy way to disconnect,” that the “intimacy felt like less than making out on a couch.” A combination of the meds she was taking for her cancer, which sent her into medical menopause, plus a negative sexual encounter on one of her early dates, meant penetrative sex was off the table entirely for most of her post-marriage sex life. She told Boyer about what she was doing early on, and Boyer was impressed and inspired. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, this is so fun,’” remembers Boyer. One of her only real moments of judgment involved the prebreakfast dates: “I’m like, ‘Who has sex at 9 a.m.?’” The two had always wanted to do something creative together, and Boyer came up with a name and the concept while they were driving one afternoon around the corner from Hugo’s. “I’m like, ‘I think your journey is a story, and I think it’s called Dying for Sex,’” she says. “So then her sexual escapades became a check-in with me: ‘I’ve got to tell you what happened.’ And we put it under this guise of ‘We’re working.’ We had this fire under us.”

Kochan and Boyer, who had by then had a few acting and hosting gigs, pitched it as a TV show first, but nobody bit. TV execs didn’t understand it or know how to package it. One suggested a “sexy, fun girl” Sex and the City–type thing. Kochan turned it down; she knew it needed to be more than that. She and Boyer eventually decided to start recording it as a podcast on their own, and in 2018, they produced a ten-episode show all about Kochan’s death-defying sexcapades.

Over the course of the podcast, Kochan, who was a magnetic, funny speaker with a rich sense of the absurd, dryly recalls “stepping on a guy’s nuts” and speaks with casual detachment about how she had to check with her physician’s assistant if peeing in a guy’s mouth could poison him because of the cancer drugs she was taking. But the reality of her health intrudes at inopportune times. She and Boyer recorded part of episode four, for example, from the emergency room, where she had just been admitted for blood clots; she bemoans her “fat leg.” Increasingly exhausted from the cancer and the treatments, she soon realizes the sex may not be working the same as it was before. “I was bummed out,” she says of this realization, “but maybe I’m evolving.” She shares with Boyer, quite vulnerably, that she might be interested in meeting somebody who can actually invest in love, somebody who wants to “learn me.”

By the fall of 2018, Kochan’s health was taking a serious turn for the worse. At their final lunch at Hugo’s, Boyer recalls her being weak, unable to keep food down. But both still thought she had years left, not months. About a month later, Kochan was hospitalized. Boyer became one of her full-time caretakers: washing her face, massaging her legs, bringing her soup, sitting with her as she writhed in pain. From the hospital, Kochan continued writing a memoir detailing the darker parts of her life, including instances of childhood neglect and sexual abuse that she says caused her to repress her sexuality and dissociate from herself. The memoir runs directly perpendicular to the podcast in tone — it’s raw, often angry, unvarnished. “I think the book was the wounded parts of her,” says Boyer. “I think the podcast was the truest version of her. And then, when I see Michelle play her, that’s how Molly would love to be seen.”

Boyer recalls sitting in her car alone in January 2019, acknowledging that Kochan was soon going to die. She was desperate to get Kochan’s story out before that happened, whether she had to release the episodes herself on YouTube or find a third party to assist her. Boyer had previously emailed Hernan Lopez, the then-CEO of Wondery, with a pitch for the podcast; he hadn’t gotten back to her, but she tried him one more time. As it turns out, he’d missed the first email and was walloped by the ten episodes she sent him. He came to visit Kochan at the hospital on Valentine’s Day, held her hand, and told her he was going to help tell her story. They started signing contracts while she lay in her hospital bed. In her last few weeks, Kochan was, as Boyer puts it, “unlinking from the world.” She began hallucinating — clocks flying off the walls, alien figures standing behind her doctors, feeding them information. “She was detaching from her body. I could see it in her eyes. I could see it in the way she looked at me,” says Boyer. But Kochan kept writing her book, and the two kept recording, though infrequently, on Boyer’s phone.

Boyer recalls how, during this time, Kochan was managing her death with confidence and a sense of control born from the way she had directed her sex life. She started turning down visitors who would drain her energy. She would directly address doctors who condescended to her or didn’t speak to her with enough humanity. She began thoughtfully giving away her things to the people she knew would appreciate them most. “She was so mindful of how she was going to spend her last days that I was like, ‘I think this is about more than just sex. This is about navigating your own ending and being really present for whatever life you have left,’” says Boyer.

The episodes from this time are wrenching to listen to. Kochan’s voice gets smaller, quieter, her breaths raspier. She lets go of the sex. “I don’t miss it,” she says. “Sex is great to plug you into your body, or to find your body, and I don’t need that anymore. My body did a really good job.” Kochan died on March 8, 2019, at age 45. She left Boyer everything: her memoir, her laptop, her phone. “She said, ‘Promise me that you’ll publish my book. Promise me that you’ll do whatever you can to get this out here.’ She very much wanted to make her mark on this world,” Boyer says.

Released in February 2020, about a year after Kochan’s death, the podcast is a combination of those ten original self-made episodes, Boyer’s in-hospital recordings, Kochan’s book, and the ruminating and reporting Boyer did after Kochan’s death. It was an instant hit. It made its way to Meriwether’s inbox that March via a producer she’d worked with who thought she’d be interested in it. At the time, Meriwether was in the middle of making the Elizabeth Holmes miniseries The Dropout, but she was immediately struck by Kochan’s story. “That podcast starts, and it’s like you’re just hanging out with friends,” she says. “And then by the end, you’re just like, How did this get to be the most profound story I’ve heard? ” Boyer had multiple meetings with prospective adapters before the final podcast episode aired. She asked Kochan for guidance when trying to figure out who would be the right person to tell their shared story. “I talk to her a lot,” Boyer says. “And the funny thing is she always said to me, ‘You’re my soul mate.’ And I would always be like, ‘I love you so much. No, you’re not my soul mate. Stop being weird.’ And now I’m like, Oh my God. She’s my soul mate.”

On the TV show, Jenny Slate’s Nikki runs herself into the ground, giving up nearly everything in her own life to take care of Molly, but she never lets her friend see the strain. Slate’s beautifully expressive face holds all of that in every scene: the immense stress she’s under, the deep pain she feels about her friend’s imminent death, the joy she gets from taking care of her, the rage she feels against the medical system that failed her, the cheerful veneer she paints on top of it all so that Molly feels supported and unafraid. In one memorable scene, after Molly nearly dies and has to have a breathing tube inserted, Nikki, going on 30-plus hours without sleep, stands at the foot of Molly’s bed and performs a series of monologues — Shakespeare, Cher from Clueless — while Molly, unable to speak, simply watches, radiating with appreciation and love.

When the chemistry read came Slate’s way in late 2023, she had long been looking for something with depth and breadth where she wouldn’t just be relying on her comedy chops. She had recently told her agents she wanted to wait for it at the expense of other jobs, which was particularly scary with a mortgage and a young child. “I kept saying, ‘I want to go full wingspan,’” Slate says. “‘I feel like I’m just being given little carrier-pigeon things. I want to do what I know I can do, but it’s hard to describe what I can do unless I can do it.’” When she got the role, Slate sobbed with gratitude. She says it feels like “the most important one yet.”

When it came to portraying Boyer, Slate didn’t feel she needed to mimic her. “I really only listened to the full podcast when we were almost ending because I don’t want to get in my head about not replicating her, and she doesn’t seem to care about that,” she says. “She cares about the spirit of the thing because she and Molly are spirit partners.”

When Boyer saw Slate and Williams on set and in character for the first time, she says, “it didn’t feel like me and Molly, but at the same time, it felt like me and Molly.” Williams’s transformation was particularly overwhelming to witness. “I think there was something spiritual happening because she morphed into Molly so many times where I was like, How would she have known that’s what she did with her mouth? How would she have known that’s how she held her shoulders? ” says Boyer.

Williams says she got her clues about Molly’s physicality from photos, the podcast, and her writing. “You can take a best guess, based on the available information, how they might move. She comes through so beautifully in the podcast, just her timing, her delivery,” she says.

Williams carried a notebook with her on set. “It’s my little school notebook,” she says, “my touchstones.” On every job since Blue Valentine, Williams says she has put together a character workbook full of ideas, inspirations, poems, quotes from friends, and stray notes about the world around her. It’s always a specific brand — Postalco, based in Japan — and has to have a grid pattern. “If something’s running dry,” she says, “I’ll just go back to my book and see if I can find something there that will freshen the scene up.” She keeps the details of the notebook to herself. “My own history that I bring to it, how the script wove with that, and how the words kind of become sutures for what I need to learn and how I need to grow” are things she guards protectively, she says. “You have to build some kind of safe place inside yourself. Otherwise you won’t last.”

There’s a beautiful photo of Susan Sontag taken by her partner, Annie Leibovitz, in 1998 at Mount Sinai Hospital. Lying sick in bed in a medical gown, Sontag looks seductively into the camera, straight at her lover. One of her bare legs is exposed, splayed out from beneath the sheets.

Williams brought it up to Meriwether during one of their first conversations. “She’s sick and she’s in a hospital bed, but she’s being photographed by the person she adores and who adores her. And her leg is coming out of the sheets. There’s gorgeous provocation, and there’s so much love and lust in her eyes. She looks so sexy and in love,” Williams says. “It has stayed with me for years, and I thought of it again in the context of this show. Because Molly has to radically accept her body and all of its failings, against her wishes, she’s able to radically accept what bodies do with people’s wishes. That was a beautiful transmission.”

Meriwether says the portrait ended up being a North Star for the show, specifically the idea that “a sick body can be a sexual body.” She wrote the episodes about Molly’s death while thinking of the photograph. Williams didn’t let it go, either. On set, as she prepared to film the death, she stuck her leg out of the hospital sheets and asked Meriwether, “Are we getting the leg?” Meriwether was stunned. “To be in the midst of all that, to have the frame of mind to be in the character, but also being outside of it,” she says. “It’s real good shit.”

Sitting in the restaurant, Williams tries to explain what the death scene felt like, taking long pauses and occasionally addressing herself. First she explains how Molly’s bravery — the way she accepted and directed the tone and nature of her life and death — reminded her of the very first time she felt proud and in control of her body: when she gave birth to Matilda at 25. “I was allowed to labor for 24 hours without any intervention and without any monitoring. And I had said at the outset that this is what I wanted,” she says. “And my care provider took that at face value and helped give me the experience that I had told her was important to me.”

She and her doctor stuck with the natural-birth plan even as she admitted to feeling a nine out of ten on the pain scale. “That experience for me at that age, of seeing that my body was capable of doing something … How could I not love myself if I could make this experience happen? If I could make something so beautiful, so perfect, what could possibly be wrong with me?” she says. It permanently changed the way she saw herself. “In that moment, I was completely reborn.” That her doctor listened to her and allowed her to keep going even when she was in extreme pain — that she had the control — was equally powerful. “I carried that experience with me, being in charge,” Williams says. “I really liked being the boss.”

She later made the connection between her labor and the death scene. “Life and death are in the room at the same time, in the same place,” Williams says. “When you can give somebody the experience that they crave of their engineered exit, I related it to this experience that I had when I was 25 — of how this doctor cared for me and how much I appreciated her ability to allow me to feel.”

At the end of the day, which was also the end of the shoot, Williams stood up from the bed. She left the hospital soundstage and walked outside into the sunlight. “It’s not normal that we get to walk away from it,” she says of pretending to die and then rejoining the living. “It feels like the most jubilant experience that you could possibly imagine.” She began to run. “I remember how long my legs felt,” she says, smiling. “I felt like an antelope or something. Like I didn’t know my body could do this.”

Photo: Julieta Cervantes

Bad theater can be uniquely enraging. (Arguably, I’m here writing this because I once got very mad while watching a play.) But it can also be simply baffling. Who approved of this? What does this thing actually want to say? Is anyone in this room, onstage or off, having a good time? Why do the cops’ flak jackets say “Polizia” while the military uniforms have American flags on them? Does this play take place in a future where the U.S. has annexed Venice?

“This play” is Othello, currently looking pretty spry as it breaks Broadway box office records and charges as much as $921 for tickets. “Othello will outlive you!” my tenth-grade English teacher shouted at a kid in my class who didn’t feel like tuning in for a day of close reading. She was and is right, though it’s clearly not Shakespeare racking up those grosses: It’s Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal. And while it’s true that a Venn diagram exists between celebrity-driven projects and compelling art—and that the center can be a thrilling place—Kenny Leon’s passionless new production is about as far from that overlap as it’s possible to get. Audience and ensemble alike are lost in a hinterland so disconcertingly sleepy and beige that it’s hard to summon anything as visceral as fury. At the forefront of the whole thing, Washington isn’t bothering—at least in any legible way—to feel much, so how can we?

Samuel Taylor Coleridge scribbled a note in the margins of his copy of Othello about “the motive-hunting of Motiveless malignity” — a reference to the way in which the play’s treacherous villain, Iago, cooks up a variety of shallow rationalizations for a hatred that’s too deep and insidious to stem from any neatly explicable circumstance. But what of the motive-hunting of a motiveless production? Leon’s Othello has no opinion, no reason for being beyond the movie stars at its center. It barely even has a pulse. On a set of heavy, generic columns by Derek McLane, actors in standard-issue navy suits and Desert Storm–style fatigues reshuffle themselves into indifferent configurations. (“The Near Future” reads a lone projection on those columns at the top of the play — though what this is meant to teach us about the rules of this onstage universe, who can say?) Eventually, the monoliths start sliding ponderously back and forth to break up the space—as a truly bewildering melange of transition music plays—but for a long time, Leon seems unsure of what to do with his actors besides have them walk straight downstage-center and stand next to each other to conduct a scene. Eye contact is in bizarrely low supply; even more scarce is any sense of urgency or enthusiasm.

As Cassio, the handsome lieutenant that Othello has promoted above Iago, Andrew Burnap makes the most solid effort to put something behind the words, but he’s hardly the play’s engine. That combustive energy has to come from the poisonous plotter, Iago (Gyllenhaal), and from Othello himself, the honorable general that Iago tortures and deceives into a shattering act of violence. Gyllenhaal, while sturdy enough with the language, achieves only intermittent glints of Iago’s venomous vitality. Back in his Jarhead* crewcut, he’s square-shouldered and furrow-browed, straightforward and bro-ish. He and Washington spend long stretches of the show with their hands in a martial clasp behind their backs — the kind of attempt at “realism” that’s always a bad excuse for not giving characters a full psychophysical life. It’s all well and good to avoid mustache-twirling as Iago; it’s another thing to remain largely opaque, to dampen the electrical current of the character’s terrible canniness. Gyllenhaal’s most human moments come during his soliloquies, where his face sometimes twists into ugly hurt and his voice thickens: He’s playing Iago’s stated motives—Othello’s failure to promote him and his own vague suspicion that the general might have cuckolded him—as earnest drivers of action. What he’s not doing is tapping into a deeper, more frightening, less decipherable devil.

Washington, meanwhile, seems—or at least seemed, the night I saw the show—to be miles away from the Barrymore Theatre. He starts the role smiling and unflappable, his trademark dignity and charm doing the bulk of the work, albeit at a fairly low voltage. And while it makes sense to give Othello a long arc—from integrity and decency to decimated, brutal heartbreak—Washington stays so stubbornly reeled in that it’s hard not to think he and Leon are intentionally avoiding the part’s inevitable leaps. Othello isn’t exactly the most approachable of Shakespeare’s plays in 2025: Like The Merchant of Venice, it carries around a vexed and insoluble discourse. Is it racist or does it show racism? (Both can be true.) Is it a great role for a Black actor or is it a trap — a narrative that, for all Othello’s seeming nobility, ultimately showed London audiences a Black man getting gaslit into exactly the kind of violent behavior they perhaps expected of him all along? In order to take on the play today, a creative team has got to have a profound sense of why — of what this thing is deeply about, what it’s doing in a modern context, how the racial dynamics of its world are in conversation with those of ours, and of who its characters are as living, breathing human beings and why we should care.

None of that is present on Leon’s stage. It may be that Washington’s lackluster performance stems from a misfiring if understandable desire to avoid stereotypes of outsize passion—of big, blustery emotional fireworks in a thorny role of color—yet the result is that we go on no journey with his Othello. We listen to him say words; we don’t, even as he enters the bedroom of his innocent wife, Desdemona (Molly Osborne), to strangle her, experience his awful interior transformation. Instead, as he approaches her in these fateful moments, a truly unsettling percentage of the audience is still laughing. (The more-than-40-year age gap between the actors also gives rise to one of the least sexy unions I’ve ever seen on stage; when this Othello gives his sleeping wife a series of tortured final kisses, he bends over stiffly from the waist and pecks her chastely on the forehead.) Washington seems most comfortable leaning into little relatable flourishes that might earn a chuckle—his “Why did I marry?” when Iago starts to crack the seals of his confidence is more wry and sitcom-ish than distraught—but that impulse curdles up inside a speech like the one he’s got to give as a prologue to murder. “I’ll not shed her blood, / Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow, / And smooth as monumental alabaster,” he says. (Leon leaves in place pretty much all of the play’s language that idealizes whiteness and denigrates Blackness.) Then he pauses before continuing, almost nonchalantly: “Yet she must die.” The audience giggles. Is that what the production—what any production of Othello—really wants?

Washington isn’t alone in his drastic underplaying of the story’s stakes. When Desdemona and her lady-in-waiting, Emilia (Kimber Elayne Sprawl)—Iago’s wife, here styled as a fellow soldier in an ambiguous status relationship with the general’s wife—enter at the top of the production’s second act, they’re looking for a handkerchief that will prove pivotal in Iago’s schemes, and Desdemona knows its disappearance is no trivial thing. “Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse / Full of crusadoes,” she tells Emilia. But Osborne and Sprawl enter the stage casually, taking Leon’s favorite route as they meander toward downstage-center. Osborne’s “Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?” sounds about equivalent to, “Girl, have you seen my car keys?” Later on, Sprawl breezes through one of the play’s best speeches, Emilia’s sharp, brief gut-punch on the hypocrisy of men. “But I do think it is their husbands’ faults / If wives do fall,” she tells the shaken Desdemona. It’s a ferocious eighteen lines in a play that can’t be credited with doing an overall great job with its women — but Leon has Sprawl stand behind Osborne, who’s seated on a bench, and deliver the whole thing facing out, connecting to no one, targetless and underpowered.

Those adjectives could also be more generally applied to the production, which often feels like it’s joined Jason Isaacs in stealing Parker Posey’s lorazepam. Perhaps most confusingly, this Othello seems determined to say almost nothing about race, 400 years ago, now, or in the near future. Here, Montano (Ezra Knight), the governor of Cyprus where Othello and his troops are stationed, and Emilia are both played by Black actors, but Othello is still the only character whose Blackness seems to matter, as well as the only one referred to as a “Moor” — a word that, yes, carries a specific ethnic definition, but that’s also just as frequently flung around as a slur in the play. (Even the production’s approach to that friction feels shaky: The term’s usage in action causes no distinct ripples among the characters, and the show program describes Othello as “a Moor” and a “Marine Corps General” as if the phrases were equally neutral.) Leon also retains record-needle-scratch moments like the Duke of Venice (Neal Bledsoe, giving Gavin Newsom) seemingly praising Othello by telling Desdemona’s father, “Noble signior, / If virtue no delighted beauty lack, / Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.” If characters are going to talk like this, we’ve got to understand something about the world they’re inhabiting: If it’s a fundamentally, historically racist world—ours or a variant thereon—then how many of the people living in it are aware? How does it weigh on them? Who battles it, who hides from it, who exploits it? Who feels anything about it at all? Questions, perhaps, for another production, one with more blood in its veins, no matter the cost of its seats.

Othello is at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre.

Spoilers for The White Lotus season three, episode six, “Denials.”

Mike White had been teasing White Lotus season-three viewers with some brother-on-brother action between Saxon and Lochlan, the Ratliff boys played by nepo-babies-in-arms Patrick Schwarzenegger and Sam Nivola, since the very first episode. The season practically marinates in the queasiness of the prospect, luxuriating in the taboo with Saxon’s whole “so hetero something’s gotta give” aura; his generally carnal disposition around his siblings; and Lochlan’s own inscrutable demeanor, capitalized upon with that early scene in the premiere where he quietly gazes at Saxon’s bare ass. It’s a whole lot of setup, and it would either be malpractice or simply out of character for The White Lotus to simply nudge, nudge, wink, wink, then head-fake away from crossing that boundary.

Sure, it’s reasonable to think that their make-out sesh in “Full-Moon Party” (egged on by Charlotte Le Bon’s Chloe during their brotherly three-way) was going to be as far as it would go. But this is HBO we’re talking about. Incest is like an every-other-Tuesday thing at that place. There was, obviously, the whole Lannister situation on Game of Thrones, which turned out to be grade-school stuff compared to the niece-uncle marriage-and-office rivalry that’s ultimately table stakes in House of the Dragon. HBO’s affinity for intra-bloodline paramour-ing isn’t just limited to the fantasy genre either: Recall the short-lived Gossip Girl reboot, which featured an offhanded twincest reveal that pretty much only existed for a punch line. In any case, The White Lotus already flirted with a shock incest scene last season, when Tom Hollander’s mysterious Quentin was caught railing Leo Woodall’s Jack, whom he had previously introduced as his “naughty nephew.” Now, in retrospect, it’s all but certain they weren’t actually related beyond being connected by the same criminal scheme, but the moment did result in Jennifer Coolidge’s late, great Tanya McQuoid uttering the deeply memorable line: “Well, he was kinda fucking his uncle.”

All of which is to say that, in a world where super-producer Ryan Murphy has already mixed incest and parenticide with Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, a make-out sesh was not enough. The payoff had to be more transgressive than that, so it made every sense in the world that this week’s episode, “Denials,” yanks us back into the hazy memory of the Ratliff boys’ megayacht bender to make an additional taboo-tastic reveal, with the brothers gradually learning — Saxon by being told by Chloe and Chelsea; Lochlan while vibing out in meditative bliss — that the height of their brotherly love wasn’t capped at a mere locking of lips, but with a straight-up handy.

Yeah, it’s sacrilegious, but The White Lotus demands it. The meta-story of the series is one of escalation season over season. The debut Hawaii outing stroked its viewers’ neuroses around money and rounded things out with hotel manager Armond in a drug-induced bender during which he’s caught giving a rim job, defecates into a guest’s luggage, and dies after accidentally shoving his chest into a knife. The second Sicilian season ramped things up by shifting its gaze to carnal matters — the Cameron-Daphne-Harper-Ethan quad, in particular, is a knotty yarn exploring how wealth reshapes sexual politics — and ended its run with Tanya shooting up a yacht, then dying after hitting her head in a vain attempt to jump on a lifeboat. This Thai jaunt has firmly served up yet another escalation. Now wading into Western anxieties around death and spirituality, the season has proved to be a markedly darker and stranger affair: An active-shooter event anchors the opening flash-forward, the image of Ratliff patriarch Timothy pointing a gun to his own head is now a meme, and Sam Rockwell makes a cameo for the ages where his character extensively narrates his journey into embodying an Asian woman.

Last week’s make-out scene triggered quite the hubbub; one can only imagine jaws are back on the floor after tonight. David Bernad, an executive producer on the show, insisted to the New York Post that these bouts of incest aren’t just bandied about for shock value — and that they will, in fact, culminate “in a very satisfying way.” We’ll see about that, but I’m sated enough by the effort. I’m more interested in what comes next in the itinerary, given that the fourth season has already been green-lit. Where will White’s Lotus go from here? Necrophilia? Russia?",vulture

https://vulture.com,This Is Not the First Miscast Wuthering Heights,https://www.vulture.com/article/margot-robbie-wuthering-heights-age.html,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:00:01 GMT","Kaya Scodelario in 2011’s Wuthering Heights; Margot Robbie. Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos: Oscilloscope, Karwai Tang/WireImage

Margot Robbie is no Cathy Linton. That hasn’t stopped her, however, from standing on the English hillside in a billowing wedding dress on the set of Emerald Fennell’s adaptation of Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights. There was a brief but notable outcry when Robbie and Jacob Elordi, playing Brontë’s brooding Heathcliff, were announced: These stars are too old, too tan, too Australian. The first surreptitious shots of Robbie in costume, however, lit up the internet anew.

What we know with certainty about Cathy and Heathcliff is that they meet in their adolescence, their tumultuous courtship lasting until Cathy’s death at age 19. Cathy is canonically brunette, while Heathcliff — a foundling, or orphan — has a dark complexion that leads characters to suggest he may have Romani heritage. Neither are, despite Fennell’s casting, Australian, but it’s always good to double-check that kind of thing. Their relatively young ages and social differences contribute to their doomed romance, but Brontë’s novel is more often defined by its depiction of cruelty and morality within the rigid English class system. You know, classic Emerald Fennell stuff.

That Fennell’s adaptation is being picked apart before we even have approved press stills is perhaps mostly indicative of her reputation as a divisive director, prone to exaggeration and excess. Fennell’s films often elide both history and plausibility — strict adherence to period-appropriate accuracy in casting, costume, or feel is besides the point. We don’t yet know what Fennell’s “take” on the material is — if any — or whether the ages or costumes are gestures of purpose or convenience of star power. But even if the director isn’t doing something crazy with the text, that doesn’t necessarily mean her film is doomed so much as it joins a catalogue of “miscast” Wuthering Heights.

Since the publication of Wuthering Heights in 1847, more adaptations than not have abandoned faithfulness to the text in lieu of artistic vision. The very first adaptation of the novel was a silent film in 1920 directed by A.V. Bramble, starring Anne Trevor (who was around 20 at the time of shooting) and Milton Rosmer (who would have been nearly 40). Since then, Wuthering Heights has traveled around the globe with adaptations in French and Spanish and Hindi, starring actors of all sorts of ages and backgrounds. Most of those who have played Cathy and Heathcliff — Juliette Binoche, Merle Oberon, and Rosemary Harris, for instance, as well as Ralph Fiennes, Laurence Olivier, and Tom Hardy — are far older than the required ages for the duo.

There are certainly some good adaptations of Wuthering Heights, but part of why the book has endured is because of how difficult it is to bring to life. Cathy and Heathcliff are tricky characters, moody and selfish and destructive (teenagers …), whose inconsistent qualities are their only constant. Their relationship is both fated and impossible to root for. Set in the dreary English moors, Brontë’s book is steeped in mist and mystery. Wuthering Heights was her only novel, and it feels apt that no one adaptation has ever really nailed that which makes her book so literally singular.

You don’t have to go back 100 years, however, to get the most “accurate” adaptation of the novel so far, only about a decade. Andrea Arnold’s 2011 take on the novel, starring Kaya Scodelario and James Howson, indulged in the dark, swampy qualities of the novel, emphasizing the bleak and animalistic qualities of the two lovers over the explicitly erotic (though there was some of that, too). Scodelario and Howson are fantastic and as close to age-appropriate as any. The film is solid if not harsh, like walking directly into the wind, but its adherence to literary canon didn’t necessarily carry Arnold’s film into the beloved literary classic canon. All of which is to say, there’s time yet for Fennell’s adaptation to delight (or disappoint) us. Besides, no one can unseat the best adaptation, Kate Bush’s “Wuthering Heights.” It would be foolish to even try.",vulture

Studio executives are much-maligned figures. After all, they’re the ones shelving Coyote vs. Acme for tax purposes and telling Sally from Barry a mysterious algorithm decided her dream is crushed. But what if their lives are really hard, actually? Seth Rogen’s new sitcom, The Studio, sees him as a movie exec frantically trying to do the impossible: make good films that are also blockbusters. Naturally, Rogen needs an A-list cast, including starry regulars and even starrier guest stars. Below, everything we know about the show-business TV show.

Who’s in the cast?

The main cast for The Studio includes Rogen as Mark, the newly appointed head at the fictional studio Continental. Rogen is joined by Catherine O’Hara as Mark’s predecessor, Patty Leigh; Ike Barinholtz as Mark’s bestie and colleague, Sal Saperstein; Chase Sui Wonders as Quinn Hacket, Mark’s former assistant turned creative executive; and Kathryn Hahn as marketing executive Amy.

You mentioned guest stars?

Oh yeah. Lots of guest stars. Rogen revealed the full list via a video interview with Apple TV+ on March 24. Those not playing themselves include Bryan Cranston, who is playing the mustachioed Griffin Mill; Dewayne Perkins (The Blackening) as studio “yes man” Tyler; Keyla Monteresso Mejia (Curb Your Enthusiasm) as assistant Petra; and David Krumholtz (Oppenheimer) as agent Mitch White.

In the video, Rogen mentions a spate of guest stars by name — Martin Scorsese, Charlize Theron, Zoë Kravitz, Zac Efron, Olivia Wilde, Greta Lee, Anthony Mackie, Ron Howard, Dave Franco, Quinta Brunson, and Ramy Youssef — which doesn’t even include everyone notable. Some of these people are confirmed to be playing themselves, such as Lee, who appears in the trailer.

Then, there’s the whole slew of other people who Rogen doesn’t mention but who show up on a title card. That list includes Steve Buscemi, Ice Cube, Paul Dano, Hacks creators Paul W. Downs and Lucia Aniello, Lil Rel Howery, Josh Hutcherson, Johnny Knoxville, Sarah Polley, Adam Scott, Jean Smart, Zach Snyder, Aaron Sorkin, Antony Starr, Nicholas Stoller, and Ziwe. Got all that?

Roll the trailer.

This jazzy joint gets increasingly stressful as Mark attempts to navigate the industry. “The job is a meat grinder,” O’Hara’s Patty intones. Then, within a minute, someone gets hit by a car. Is the The Bear for the people who work on The Bear?

What is the release date?

The executives at Apple TV+ decided The Studio will premiere on March 26. Hope they enjoy.",vulture
https://vulture.com,"Finally, The Best Star Wars Show Is Coming Back",https://www.vulture.com/article/andor-season-2-trailer.html,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 13:30:00 GMT","The trailer for Andor starts off with a strut that only a man who knows he’s leading the best show on Disney+ can pull off. In a long look at the second and final season of this Rogue One prologue, created by Tony Gilroy, Diego Luna’s titular character declares “I came with you to be part of something. The Empire cannot win.” No matter the answer, there’s a whole lot of fight in this teaser as Cassian Andor and the Rebel Alliance try to tear the Empire down. There’s explosions, good old-fashioned Star Wars TIE-fighter-on-starfighter chases, a glimpse of the Death Star, and a Mon Mothma dance break, all set to Steve Earle’s “The Revolution Starts Now,” a fun departure from the classic Star Wars score.

The final season will debut April 22 on Disney+ with a three-episode premiere. The subsequent four weeks will drop three episodes at a time, so you can savor the thrill of Andor but also not wait 12 weeks to rewatch Rogue One, which Andor will lead us right up to. Stellan Skarsgård, Genevieve O’Reilly, Forest Whitaker, Adria Arjona, Kyle Soller, and Denise Gough return to season two, while Ben Mendelsohn and Alan Tudyk join the cast this season to reprise their Rogue One roles as the Imperial goon Orson Krennic and droid K-2SO, respectively. Meanwhile, we need to know if composer Nicholas Britell is going to give us the return of “Niamos! (Morlana Club Mix)” and maybe a part two.

https://vulture.com,Conan O’Brien Accepts the Mark Twain Prize With ‘Unceasing Silliness’,https://www.vulture.com/article/conan-obrien-2025-mark-twain-prize-acceptance-speech.html,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:21:19 GMT","Photo: Clifton Prescod/Netflix

These are the full remarks made by Conan O’Brien upon receiving the 2025 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center on Sunday, March 23, 2025. The award is given annually to comedians whose work has had a profound impact on the public and popular culture.

This year’s ceremony was the first major, splashy event held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts since President Donald Trump packed the arts institution’s board of directors with allies who then elected Trump as board chairman, replacing longtime chair David Rubenstein. Trump also fired Kennedy Center president Deborah Rutter and placed another loyalist, Richard Grenell, in her role, which has led to uncertainty about the Center’s future and anxiety among performers and its existing staff .

Here’s how O’Brien accepted his prize while addressing the moment. A fuller recap of the event can be read here. The ceremony will stream on Netflix starting May 4.

To be handed this award by David Letterman is, to be honest, very hard for me to comprehend. I need to put this in context so you will understand. The year is 1987, and I’m living in Los Angeles. I’m only two years out of college, and I’m unemployed. My partner Greg [Daniels] and I had just lost our first job writing for television, and I’m sitting alone in a Du-Par’s Diner on Wilshire Boulevard eating pancakes very slowly at one in the afternoon to try and fill out the entire day. My burning ambition — I believe my destiny — is to write for Dave’s late-night show, and I have just heard from their head writer that the only open slot has already been filled and there will be no job. I remember it feels like a steel door has come down. I have no idea what is going to become of me.

Two weeks later — this is true — I go to take a job at Wilson’s House of Suede and Leather. I live in a $380-a-month apartment. I drive an old Plymouth Valiant that I bought from some surfing drug dealers in Santa Monica. And my supposed career in comedy feels, at best, tenuous. All I know for sure is that I am very, very scared. Now, imagine that suddenly some angel from the future appears in that Du-Par’s on Wilshire and tells me that 40 years from now, I’m going to be onstage at the Kennedy Center in Washington and that the most prestigious award in comedy is going to be handed to me by David Letterman. I would have stared at that angel in utter shock and said, “Wait a minute. David Letterman is still alive? Forty years from now? He’s 20 years older than me! God, how does he look?” The angel would say, “He’s got a beard.” I’d say, “Is it trim and fashionable?” The angel would say, “No! It’s really white and crazy-long. Imagine if Dostoevsky was panhandling for gold in the Yukon.” [O’Brien turns to Letterman, seated in a box adjacent to the stage.] What are you doing, man?

So you have to understand that what just transpired for me was an Oppenheimer at Los Angeles — well, close — Oppenheimer at Los Alamos moment. Before I go any further, I have to give thanks first to my parents, who missed witnessing this by three months. They would have absolutely loved this. To my beautiful and talented wife, Liza. To my patient and perpetually unimpressed children, Neve and Beckett. They honestly don’t get it, and they’re not wrong.

I want to thank this band — Max Weinberg and the rest of the band. I want to thank all the insanely generous and talented speakers who flew to D.C. on my behalf for this evening. I will never recover from this. It is what my people call a mitzvah. My people borrow stuff we like.

Also, my thanks to the people who invited me here several months ago, David Rubenstein and Deborah Rutter. Honestly, I don’t know why they aren’t here tonight. I lost Wi-Fi in January. I assume they’re in traffic. And a special thanks to all the beautiful people who have worked here at the Kennedy Center for years and who are worried about what the future might bring. My eternal thanks for their selfless devotion to the arts.

There are so many people to thank, and this is always where these speeches go south, because you have to thank all these people. You have to. It’s the rule. But then it takes forever. So I had an idea to thank everyone as quickly as possible.

[Conan introduces a professional livestock auctioneer, who comes out and very quickly reads a long list of names.]

Any award, or in this case prize, which technically is three notches down from an award — “I got a prize! It came in cereal!” — let’s be honest, it can seem trivial. This honor feels very different to me. I think accepting an award named after Mark Twain is a responsibility. One cannot invoke Twain without understanding who he was and what he stood for. Now, don’t be distracted by the white suit and the cigar and the riverboat. Twain is alive, vibrant, and vitally relevant today. Yes, he is America’s greatest humorist, but his enduring power springs from his core principles, principles that shaped his comedy and made him one of our greatest Americans.

First and foremost, Twain hated bullies. He populated his works with abusers such as Huck Finn’s alcoholic father and Tom Driscoll in Pudd’nhead Wilson, and he made his readers passionately hate those characters. He punched up, not down, and he deeply, deeply empathized with the weak. Twain was allergic to hypocrisy, and he loathed racism. Twain wrote, “There are many humorous things in the world; among them, the white man’s notion that he is less savage than the other savages.”

Twain empathized with the powerless in America — former slaves struggling under Reconstruction, immigrant Chinese laborers in California, and European Jews fleeing anti-Semitism. Twain’s remedy for ignorance about the world around us was to travel at a time when travel was very long and very difficult. Twain circled the globe and he wrote, “Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts.”

Twain was suspicious of populism, jingoism, imperialism, the money-obsessed mania of the Gilded Age, and any expression of mindless American might or self-importance. Above all, Twain was a patriot in the best sense of the word. He loved America but knew it was deeply flawed. Twain wrote, “Patriotism is supporting your country all of the time and your government when it deserves it.”

Some of you might be thinking, What does this have to do with comedy? It has everything to do with comedy. Everything! The comedy I have loved all of my life is comedy that is self-critical, deflating, and dedicated to the proposition that we are all flawed, absurd, and wallowing in the mud together. Twain is funny and important today because his comedy is a hilarious celebration of our fears, our ineptitude, and the glorious mess of being human. When we celebrate Twain, truly see him for who he was, we acknowledge our commonality, and we move just a little closer together. So I accept this award in the spirit of humility, stupidity and envy, irrelevance, fear, self-doubt, and profound, unceasing silliness. I thank you. It’s the honor of a lifetime.",vulture

Let us rejoice: John Mulaney, Richard Kind, and Saymo are gracing our screens in tandem again. Everybody’s Live With John Mulaney, the follow-up to Mulaney’s 2024 live talk show, Everybody’s in L.A, has begun its 12-week run. Despite the chaos and unpredictability baked into the show’s format, one thing we know to expect is an unlikely mishmash of guests. “This will be the one place where you could see Arnold Schwarzenegger sitting next to Nikki Glaser sitting next to a family therapist with music by Mannequin Pussy,” the comedian joked during Netflix’s Next on Netflix event in January. With the show finally hitting our screens, we don’t have to deal in hypotheticals any longer. Below, everything we know so far, including a trailer and this week’s special guests.

Who are the guests going live?

March 12: Michael Keaton, Joan Baez, Fred Armisen, personal finance columnist Jessica Roy, and music from Cypress Hill.

March 19: Nick Kroll, Ben Stiller, Quinta Brunson, cruise industry expert Anne Kalosh, and music from Kim Gordon and Kim Deal

March 26: Pete Davidson, Luenell, Henry Winkler, licensed funeral director and embalmer Raymundo Perez-Plascencia, and music from Mannequin Pussy

Let’s see the trailer.

The scene opens on Mulaney standing in a ground-level parking lot, barely visible in the sights of an aerial drone camera. “Let me know when you’re tight enough that I should say the line,” he says as the drone camera slowly creeps in. “Is someone going to cue me … I just want to be tight enough that saying the line makes sense.” Because, if we learned anything from the first iteration of this show, “making sense” is undeniably one of its creative priorities.

What else did Mulaney say at Next on Netflix?

Aside from revealing that the show would be less L.A.-centric than its predecessor and that his two beloved sidekicks would be returning, the comedian gave an address light on details but heavy on jokes. “We will be live globally with no delay,” he said. “We will never be relevant. We will never be your source for news. We will always be reckless. Netflix will always provide us with data that we will ignore.” Elsewhere, he joked that “there is absolutely nothing new” about the show’s conceit, but that he is simply “taking a lot of elements other people have already done and doing them out of order so” it feels fresh by default. “Not since Harry and Meghan has Netflix given more money to someone without a specific plan,” he said.

Will this be the show’s last season?

Not unless something goes terribly wrong. Netflix was apparently so enthused by Mulaney’s pitch that they gave Everybody’s Live a two-season order.

Spoilers for the latest episode of The White Lotus follow.

The White Lotus this week officially became Les Brothers Dangereux. Not only did Lochlan (Sam Nivola) kiss his brother, Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger), he also jerked him off. Don’t worry, it was awkward for everyone, including the actors. “Patrick was already like a brother to me,” Nivola told Variety of filming the scene. “It felt sort of fucked up.” “Exactly, use that,” Stanislavski shouts from beyond.

“It was very weird kissing Patrick because he’s a really good friend of mine,” Nivola also said. “And, you know, I’m straight, he’s straight. It’s already weird. It would have been easier if that was the first time we were meeting.”

Still, Nivola saw Mike White’s thematic vision. “The sexual nature of that scene is just a blown-out, big way of saying: I’m trying to please Saxon in any way in order to feel loved in return,” he explained to W. “Then I go too far, and it totally backfires, and he wants nothing to do with me.”

Conan O’Brien received what many joked was the last Mark Twain Prize for American Humor on Sunday night. He was feted by such comedians as David Letterman, Sarah Silverman, and John Mulaney. “Welcome to the Kennedy Center,” Mulaney said, “or as it will be known next week, the Roy Cohn Pavilion for big strong men.” That joke, and more, will air on Netflix later this year.

Until the night of, it was unclear who would be performing at the embattled Kennedy Center to honor O’Brien. Trump did a hostile takeover of the performing arts center, and many celebs canceled their shows in response. Yet more shows were canceled by the new admin for being too woke. Not Cats, though. Never Cats.

Speaking of woke, O’Brien noted in his acceptance speech that Mark Twain held characteristics many would classify with that word nowadays. “Twain was allergic to hypocrisy and he loathed racism,” he said. “Twain was suspicious of populism, jingoism, imperialism, the money excess of the Gilded Age and any expression of mindless American might or self-importance. Above all, Twain was a patriot in the best sense of the word. He loved America but knew it was deeply flawed. Twain wrote, ‘Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it.”

O’Brien thanked former Kennedy Center chairmen David Rubenstein and president Deborah Rutter, who were fired by the president this year. “Honestly, I don’t know why they are not here tonight. I lost Wifi in January,” he said. O’Brien then thanked the Kennedy Center staff, “for years, and who are worried about what the future might bring.

Kelvin orders the workers to stop and later visits the treehouse with Keefe, where he laments life’s cruel twists of fate (“We’re all so powerless. Anything can happen.”) and reminiscences about this hideout as a refuge from whatever upset him as a child. “This place made me feel safe,” he says, not quite acknowledging that it’s on the verge of collapse.

In the writing game, we call this a metaphor.

Season four will be the last for The Righteous Gemstones, and there are signs in this mournful (and vulgar/hilarious) episode that this extremely American empire may be going the way of Kelvin’s treehouse. Just like poor Kelvin, the Gemstone children are slow to realize what’s happening and still occupy a once-resplendent house that’s losing its foundation. Denial is a powerful religious tool, after all, and a human instinct, too. There’s always going to be a money-making Telethon to fill the empty coffers or some splashy business enterprise like Prism or the Prayer Pods to bring the Gemstones back to solvency. But with Eli backing away from the church and no one with the “rizz,” much less the intelligence or savvy, to beat back challengers like Vance Simkins, the congregation seems likely to drift away. The temple is becoming a “squirt yurt.”

Granted, the Gemstones have gotten out of sticky situations before — a “sticky situation” that’s now literal thanks to Jesse’s short-lived masturbation huts — and it’s possible the Lord will see them through another fiasco, as He has in the three previous seasons. But expensive failures like the Prayer Pods are going to start to pile up, and Eli’s simple gravitas at the Aimee-Leigh Telethon was a reminder that the kids might not be able to tend the flock with dumb pyrotechnics for much longer. The Simkins threat seems particularly alarming, like a shark detecting blood in the water. He’s being almost too generous to Jesse when he likens his strip mall operations next to Gemstone ministries to opening up a Burger King in a town where there’s a McDonald’s. In reality, Simkins intends to be more like Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood, drinking up Jesse’s Shamrock shake.

One slight glimmer of trouble may be Prism, a success story that may portend failure down the line. While Kelvin basks in the glory of being a Top Christ-Following Man of the Year nominee for his bravery in “centering individuals that are usually othered by society,” the Gemstones may be overlooking who in society is doing the othering. At a meeting of The Cape and Pistol Society in which Jesse displays mastery of neither pistol nor cape, Simkins zeroes in on Kelvin’s enterprise, first as a way to mock Jesse (“I guess your homosexual brother is the Gemstone with the juice these days”) and later, when mentioning BJ’s pole-dancing accident, as a mockery of the Gemstones as a family of queers. As usual, Jesse is too puffed up to notice, but it’s worth watching how much good old-fashioned bigotry might affect the Gemstones’ futures.

This week, the show introduces Seann William Scott as Lori’s son, Corey Milsap, and Arden Myrin as his wife, Jana, who laughs uneasily at the Gemstone siblings “ripping” each other for sport. At a cookout, the humiliating demise of Jesse’s Prayer Pods is the main topic of conversation, as malls and airports ultimately decided against having a solemn refuge for public masturbation. “Homeboy here even stocked them full of lotion,” says Judy, suggesting that Jesse was willing to lean into the pods’ re-purposing. But Corey proves lousy at “ripping.” There’s no joke to telling Jana that her dress is “fucking dumb,” and there’s no joke to him pointing out that Eli has a hickey on his neck, either — or at least there wouldn’t be if Eli’s kids didn’t continue to find the idea of their dad hooking up ridiculous. Even when Corey, Jana, and the Gemstone kids spot Eli and Lori seeming affectionate with each other on the driveway, Judy snipes, “Just like picture sweet Miss Lori, you know, like, nude in her bathroom, splashing on CK One so she can get railed by Eli’s big old floppy daddy dick.”

But Miss Lori has been getting railed, and the announcement of their union over the weekly Gemstone lunch at Jason’s Steakhouse goes over poorly, to say the least. Corey condemns his mother and walks out while the Gemstone kids retreat to the freezer at Jason’s to have it out. In a show where most of the laughs come either from the salty dialogue or big visual set pieces, it’s worth noting that maybe the funniest shot of the entire episode is Kelvin sternly listening to his father’s emotional pleas while his glasses are still fogged up from the freezer. As horrified as they are by the idea of Eli finding another woman (and a family friend, no less), they’re sympathetic to his confessions of loneliness and seem willing to get him a chance. Jesse apologizes for calling him “a slut.” They are a family that can forgive as readily as they sin.

“No matter what,” Jesse says in the sermon that ends the show, “we never turn our back on family. That is our Gemstone commitment to you.” The question remains: Will that commitment be reciprocated?

Uncut Gemstones

• Who swiped the Elijah Gemstone Bible from the house in 2002? Young Kelvin would seem to have gotten a good look at the culprit, but it’s a mystery the show is tucking away for now.

• Incredible monologue by Tony Cavalero as Keefe, who takes Kelvin’s line about rain as “the devil peeing on you” and runs so far with it that he brings himself to completion far from any Prayer Pod. The speech is a reminder of Keefe’s past in more sinful corners of society and how thin the line still remains between where he was then and where he is now.

• Jesse considering whether Eli and Lori are a couple: “I did notice they were taking pisses at the same time, but I wrote that off as typical old-people shit.”

• News of the latest Simkins “encroachment” spoils Jesse’s efforts to mentor Gideon on leadership. His men seem eager to answer with violence, but Jesse wants to look diplomatic in front of his son. It’s only later, when a car full of goons toss Molotov cocktails into Simkins’s new church that he responds in the most expected Gemstone way.

• A tip of the hat to the show’s commitment to full-frontal male nudity, thanks to a casual backstage shot at the pole-dancing competition. The Righteous Gemstones seems committed to redressing the nudity balance at HBO, one floppy weenus at a time.

• Fantastic reference to BJ having a stairlift “like Mrs. Deagle has in Gremlins.” I’d rate Mrs. Deagle’s demise among the great movie deaths.

• “You think I’m intimidated by the circling of the men?”",vulture

Bong Joon Ho scored a major W over the weekend: John Carpenter agreed to take time out his busy video game schedule and score Bong’s scary movie. At a 4K restoration screening of The Thing, Director Bong said his “next-next” film will be a horror film, and he’d love for the Master of Horror to do the tunes. “I wanna do your score,” Carpenter replied before Bong could even finish asking, and the pair made it official with a handshake on-stage. That’s legally-binding in several states!

Bong Joon Ho is a massive John Carpenter fan, who rubbed his tush extra hard into Stephen Colbert’s couch on The Late Show when he learned Carpenter had previously sat there. Director Bong also got a clue out of Carpenter as to the titular Thing’s identity at the end of the film. At the end of The Thing, MacReady (Kurt Russell) and Childs (Keith David) are the only humans left alive …unless one or both of them is actually the alien. Carpenter said there’s a hint in the middle of the film that breaks the whole case wide open.

https://vulture.com,Greg-Gary’s White Lotus Villa Also Has Two Identities,https://www.curbed.com/article/white-lotus-season-3-thailand-filming-locations-greg-gary-mansion.html,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 02:05:19 GMT","Gazing out from his Philippe Starck–“inspired” home in a gated compound. Photo: Fabio Lovino/HBO

It looks like Greg-Gary’s little party on next week’s White Lotus will be taking the action out of the hotel and bringing it to his over-the-top villa — a spread we’ve so far only glimpsed here and there. The production has shared that the house is actually two locations masquerading as one, a choice that tracks for a guy with an assumed identity.

First, there’s Samujana Villa 12, a modern spread on Koh Samu. It has seven bedrooms and a wide pool stacked like white shoe boxes on the face of a hill. If we’ve seen inside this one yet, I couldn’t figure it out. (Spottings welcome in the comments.)

Most of what has been shown of the mansion so far — a living room with a peaked roof where Greg-Gary did some Belinda-Googling and where Chloe strolls through to look for him as he does laps in an infinity pool — come from a second location on Phuket, in the Amaravida, where seven bedrooms, seven full-time staffers, two pools, a hot tub on the roof, a wine room, golf course, and private beach go for $5,698 to $13,650 a night. (One continuity issue spotted by fans: So far, the show has done little to hide that the mansion is not in the hills, as Chloe described it, with redditors even screengrabbing a drone shot that shows it pressed up against the sand.)

The Amaravida is one of the 26 villas that make up a 60-acre gated compound on Cape Yamu, a peninsula that reaches into the gulf. It opened in 2008, and went into construction at a perilous time for Thailand (tsunami in 2004, military coup in 2006). The development was created by the man behind the Amanpuri, Adrian Zecha, who bragged in 2008 that he was regularly courted by governments desperate for their own Amanpuri knockoffs. The resort was the “development of the moment,” per the South China Morning Post in 2007, which dropped the names of both Zecha and his hotshot designer, Philippe Starck. Better known for his iconic chairs and spidery juicers, Starck has been steadily designing five-star hotels (and even the odd superyacht), and told the press in 2008 that he signed on with the Cape Yamu team for the chance to build something “beyond mere homes” that would be for “intelligent people; the smart tribe.” (Would we call Greg-Gary particularly smart? We may be about to learn.)

If you’re so smart, why are you eating at hotel restaurants? Photo: Fabio Lovino/HBO

Putting aside the question of high IQ, it’s clear these villas suit those with a high net worth. The 2008 design still looks like textbook Succession-y influencer luxe: sliding glass doors open to infinity pools, with views of private coastlines and tropical splendor. The largest of the Amaravida’s villas is currently on the market for $18 million.

But Starck didn’t seem to be involved with all of the homes in the compound. A website advertising rentals at 17 of them calls them “inspired by Starck,” and the page where you can click through to rent the Amaravida doesn’t name him, only saying that it was “inspired by Scandinavian architecture incorporated with Thai’s traditional roots.” The Thai features seem to show up in nearly identical living areas, villa to villa, with peaked roofs and horizontal slats framing views of the bay.

Social-media shots tagged at the villa show it’s popular with “Blonde blob-esque” girls trips and Piper-style wellness retreats. There’s also the odd influencer-model.

The other location for the Greg-Gary abode has a crunchier vibe. There are zero televisions, which seems to be part of its “wellness” sales-pitch, according to a reviewer who said there’s a “yoga deck” where a teacher can guide you in acro yoga. The gym is so intense that famous boxers stay here to train and Idris Elba came when beefing up for a role. The design matches this “wellness” vibe, with planted green roofs, rattan-wrapped columns, and walls of chunky raw stone.

The Starck-ian villa, on the other hand, leans into screens. There’s a home cinema, a golf simulator, and a pool that seems designed for the iPhone, with a wall of glass that’s become a favorite for influencers trying to both show off their location and their bikini bods. Saxon would approve.",vulture
https://indiewire.com,Patrick Schwarzenegger Talks 'White Lotus' Incest - Interview,https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/patrick-schwarzenegger-white-lotus-incest-interview-1235110852/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 15:45:00 GMT","[Editor’s Note: The Following Interview Contains Spoilers for “The White Lotus” Season 3, Episode 6, “Denials.”]

Over Three Unique Iterations of Mike White’s “The White Lotus,” Fans Of The Show Have Come To Expect Searing Critiques of Privilege Coupled with Deadpan Humor That Gets Progressively Less LuGhable as The Season Goes On. But Nothing Could Have Quite Prepared Auderves for How Unfunny Season 3, which Follow a Group of Guests at the White Lotus ’Thai Outpost, Suddenly Became On Sun Patrick Schwarzenegger and Sam Nivola’s Ratliff Brothers Consummated OnScreen Fliration.

In the role of Older Brother Saxon, Schwarzenegger Gives a Particularly Affecting Performance as a Series of Anxiety Producing Flashbacks Show A Teenage Lochlan (Nivola) Jerking OFF HIS SILING DURING A Substance-Fueled Group Hookup. Thesis Events Come After Weeks of White Lulling Viewers Into a False Sense Sense Se Parker Posey’s Slurred One-Liners and Light Satire Around Religion and Politics, which Only Began to Give Way Way Way In The Previo's episode. So they real mark the first chance the actor has had to show off his dramatic chops and introduce audiences to a more complicated version of the ratliffs ’Privilegeed Eldest son.

“You Know, Everyone’s Always Asking Me,‘ What's It Like to Play This of, Like, Douche? ’And it's hard for me to respond, Because So many people search Quick Judgments about the characters after one-third of the show, and Mike is to writer to writ One-note person, ”Schwarzenegger Said in an interview with indiewire ahead of Sunday Night’s episode.

“What’s exciting for me is for people to see what’s to come, Because there’s a real shift in the power dynamic and the relationship between the Siblings and Saxon, and Between Saxon and the Girls,” Hey Said, Referring to the Group of Characts Rounded Out by Piper Ratliff (Sarah Catherine Hook) and New Friends Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) and Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood), Who Somewhat Gleefully Break the News to Schwarzenegger’s Stunned Golden Boy.

Talking to Schwarzenegger - Who admits that his biggest Fear Going into filming “The White Lotus” What that his character would be land - it's Clear that Reaching the Latter Half of the Season Has a Big Relief. In the conversation that’s continued below, the actor, whose biggest role to date was in Hbo’s “The Staircase,” Hinted at Bigger Things to come for his character, who was in a full-on existential spiral by the time on night’s credits rolled. And he offered up his own theories about the Larger Meaning Behind the preppy Southern Brothers ’Incestuous Relationship, in Addition to Illuminating How White Drew Out His Richest Performance to Date.

The Following Interview Has Been Edited and Condensed for Clarity.

Indiewire: Thank you for Joining Me. I know you're a hot commodity right now.

Patrick Schwarzenegger: I’m excited to be able to talk with you. And Yeah, They have us bouncing all over right now, but it's fun. It's a fun time period in life.

Interest in your character has real been building over the course of the season. What there some point During filming when you realized how vital saxon was going to be to the season at large?

Well, I Think That Every Character Really is vital to the overall story and that’s one of the best parts about “White Lotus” as a Whole. Especialy This Season, there's so many characters and Yet they all somehow play a role with other’s storylines. There's search a messy clusterfuck of groups that cross over. It makes it so exciting going, by the sixth and seventh episode, The Viewer is, Like, “It Could Be any single one of these people that is the killer, but so any of these people that gets killed.” I Think That’s a Testament to Mike White’s Writing and to What He Does.

Well, then, I have to Ask, have you Seen the final Yet?

Oh, no, i haven’t.

But i assume you know what's coming? I'm just curious about how you think viewers are going to react.

I don’t real. I Honestly Don’t. I Mean, I Know What Happens With MySelf, But I Don’t Know What's going on Between all the other Group Members.

Ok, so to get back to filming the Series, Were there mike white pulled out of you as a performer that you maybe Didn’t know were there before?

I don’t know if this will Answer Your Question, but i Think what’s so great about [working with Him] is that he’s an actor. I mean, he’s the writer and the director and the showrunner and the creator, but he so has an acting background. So when he comes to you with notes, he starts to reenact the scene, like, literally redoes it in his head and plays all the characters. And then, if you’re not sur how to fully understand it, he kind of redoes it and show you again.

And he therefore Comes Up with Ideas Right at the moment. You’ll be mid-scene and all of a sudden you’ll Hear Him Shout, and He’ll Say Something You Didn’t Think of. He’ll Just Be, Like, “Try This! Try this! Try this! Try this!”

I saw in an interview he Told you That You Didn’t “Walk Rich Enough,” which sort of perfectly articulates what he does so well.

Yeah, Exactly. That’s exactly what he Said, and it was Pretty Funny.

You and sam Nivola Both Come from Famous Family with Ties to Entertainment. Were there conversations about channeling that into the performance?

In Terms of our privilege or in What Sense?

Yes, that and beg from a family where there are a lot of expensation and the pressure of beg in the public eye.

We talked, mike and i, about what kind of Things we could draw upon. And I Told Him That I Think A Vital Part To Saxon’s Story is that He’s Constantly Vying for his Dad’s Attention and Really Wanting to ProVen Himelf to his dad. That whole storyline is important, because it’s what makes saxon a little bit more human and relatable. And it’s something that I could relate to from his perspective, as well.

But we never talked about it through the lens of sam and i in the story. I’m embarrassed to say that i didn’t even know who sam was or who his family was until like six months into the thing. Hey what, like, ""Oh, i hope they don’t call me a nepo baby."" And i what, like, ""Why?""

I Think a Lot of People Don’t Know, Actually.

And i didn’t know real at all, so there you go.

So the Reason I Wanted to Do This Interview Around Episode 6 is that it feel like a real breakout moment for you, Because of the emotional intensity that you deliver. Wer the scenes in that episode the Most Challenging to Film?

Yeah, definite, episode 6 Has Uncomfortable and Weird Scenes - I guess is the way to say that. So looking for important and vital part of the overall story and saxon’s story.

In Episode 5, you start to see a different version of Him at the Koh Phangan Full Moon Party, when he's Brother Takes the Drugs. Now, it's his brother egging him on and the girls [chloe and chelsea] egging him on, and he’s on the other side of it. It’s like this idea of ​​what happens when everything you thought you were gets stripped away; That’s What’s Happening to Saxon. And episode 6 is the first time you see it in daylight.

Well, Speaking of Episode 5, there was an interview Circulating Last Week About How the look on your face when the Brothers Kiss a “Genuine Reaction.” Did you have a visceral reaction while filming that scene?

I did have a visceral reaction, because that’s what would bump. It would be weird if he [saxon] Didn’t have the reaction that i had. It's his brother, and the first reaction is not, like, to shove him off and be upset; It’s confusion.

Obviously, The Brothers ’Relationship isn’t just for Shock Value. So do you have thought on the topic significance of how that relationshipship develops and how incest is used in the plot?

Mike doesn’t Write Things to Just Write Things. I Think That He’s Smart Enough That Hates Things As A Marketing Tool - Whether IT’s How Parker [Posey] Delivers Certain Lines Or How Sincerely Saxon Talks About His Sister Being Hot. There's outlandish things through, but it all plays town the overall arc of the story and the characters.

This moment that Happens Steinwen the Brother, how i see it, is child of like in this Buddhist ideology of Both of them getting reborn into different people, into different levels of power in their relationship and in the family dynamic. Saxon becomes a new person after this. He’s Now at the Lower Half of the Totem Pole, and He No Longer Exerts This Power Over Lochlan. Everything that he stood for, everything that he’s bees talking about, has now bees fliped on its head, and he real is internalizing and questions.

So that's how I see it, but i can just tell you how i start to interpreter. You’d have to ask mike he did what he he did. I Think He would probably give you the best Answer.

There that moment when chelsea calls saxon “soulless” in episode 6. It's something sample, probable would be fore, but’s a big moment for him.

And that's real how How we wanted to play it. In Episode 1 and 2, if she called Him Soulless, Heer’ve Been, Like, ""What are you talking about, 'Soulless'? Who are you?"" [Scoffing] You Know, “Whatever.” And in this episode, He Kind of Laughs to Himelf and then looks off. You can see that it affects him and he’s Now Starting to be, like, “Wait, what?”

And in episode 7 and 8, there’s Moments Where, I Think, Mike is, Like, “I Don’t Need Him to Fully Change, I Just Want the Audience to Start to Wonder,’ ARE ARE Parts of Him That Are Starting To Think About, ‘Shopher I Change?’

There’s This Scene of Walton [Goggins] and Aimee [Lou Wood] Hugging, and I'm just looking at topic. The scene is just me staring at topic and having this internal dialogue of, “Maybe it is nice to have some appreciates you and have a relationship.

Well, that gives us something to look forward to. In the MeanTime, Congratulations on the Season and Episode 6.

Thank you. I'm curious to watch it with people. We’ll See How it goes.

https://indiewire.com,There’s Only One More Week to See the Cat from ‘Flow’ in Real Life,https://www.indiewire.com/features/animation/flow-cat-statue-riga-latvia-best-animated-film-1235110849/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:30:00 GMT","After “Flow” became the first Latvian film to win an Academy Award, the crew received much more than a warm welcome back home. Producer Matiss Kaza told IndieWire that when the Latvian filmmakers returned from Los Angeles, they were treated like they had won not just Oscar but Olympic gold.

“There was a special event at the monument of freedom in the center of Riga to welcome [us],” Kaza said. “Thousands gathered despite the late hour. A couple of days later, the entire team visited the president of Latvia. The three major trophies received by Flow were on display at the National Museum of Art, where they were seen by more than 28,000 people. Now, the trophies are touring the smaller Latvian cities, such as Liepāja, Cēsis, and Rēzekne so that fans in [those] regions can also see them in person. The nation is extremely proud of the achievement, and it is a testament to the fact that culture from small countries can have a worldwide impact and reach.”

The cutest display of national pride for the animated feature has been a real-life replica of its cat protagonist perched on top of the ‘Rīga’ letters statue that stands near the Freedom Monument. Director Gints Zilbalodis gave design details to sculptor Kristaps Andersons, who crafted a larger-than-life-size version of the cat, eyes wide and tail curled in its characteristic mix of wonder and anxiety. The sculpture will be on display near the Freedom Monument until April 1st, after which point it will be moved to the Town Hall Square in Riga — although much like the cat itself, the sculpture’s ultimate home is still unknown.

Zilbalodis had toyed with the idea of a cat struggling with a fear of water before he turned it into the wordless feature film but came back to it as a way to express very human emotions and anxieties. “Cats are very independent and do things their own way and [I thought] that could be a good starting point for this character’s arc,” Zilbadolis told IndieWire. “It can eventually learn to work together with others. It was also like, I was afraid of working together, but I figured if I made a story about it, I would have no excuse to backtrack out of it. It would be interwoven into the fabric of the story. It was my way of tricking myself into doing something I’m afraid of.”

If you would like to a photo with the tricky, courageous cat from ‘Flow’ — and experience some pride in one of the great indie success stories of 2024 — you have until April 1.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,"Every Hollywood Movie Faces an Intermission in Indian Theaters, and Even Filmmakers Can’t Stop Them",https://www.indiewire.com/features/commentary/intermissions-india-filmmakers-cant-stop-them-1235110134/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 18:00:00 GMT","When Martin Scorsese makes a request, you simply oblige. He wanted “Killers of the Flower Moon” to be experienced in one unrelenting, unbroken stretch for its 206-minute running time. But even the auteur’s vision in Indian theaters did not go as per script. Midway through the tightening tension, the screen abruptly faded to black, and the lights flickered on.

Though the word “Intermission” is not explicitly flashed on the screen during showings of Hollywood movies in India, Indians are not fazed by this time-honored tradition of forced intervals. While Scorsese hoped for his audience to embark on a journey into America’s dark past uninterrupted, in India, it was simply time for a popcorn break.

So, when Oscar winner “The Brutalist” released with a structured intermission, Indians barely noticed the novelty. Every Hollywood movie released in Indian theaters — whether Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” or James Cameron’s “Avatar: The Way of Water” — has a mid-screening intermission. Even during a brief 84-minute film such as “Flow,” audiences are jolted back to reality from its post-apocalyptic world. For Western audiences, this abrupt pause may seem like a momentum-killer or even sacrilegious. For Indian audiences, it’s part of their cinematic experience.

But why do intervals take place during Hollywood movie screenings in India, especially when the director intended for its viewers to watch it without a break?

Because Indians have an appetite for it — literally. “The food and beverage sales account for almost 30-40 percent of cinema’s revenue. In India, a lack of intermissions could mean a loss to business,” Akkshay Rathie, film exhibitor and director of Ashirwad Theatres, which has screens across western and central India, told IndieWire.

Walk into any Indian movie theater during an intermission, and you’ll witness serpentine queues at the food counters and families juggling tubs of caramel popcorn. It’s all a part of the cinema-going ecosystem that has become non-negotiable. For theater owners, these few minutes are akin to prime-time advertising slots: appealing, lucrative, and short.

“In India, movie-watching is centered around snacking, and only intermissions facilitate that. The audience demands it, and the exhibitors depend on it,” added Rathie.

But the motives aren’t just financial; they’re also cultural. Indian movies are built around intermissions.

“There is a certain syntax of storytelling that Indian movies follow, and Indian audiences expect it. Every Indian screenwriter writes movies with intermissions in mind. In fact, just when the stakes couldn’t be higher, the screen will fade to black at the mid-point. In a way, Indian movies have two climaxes — one at the interval point and one towards the end. This is not viewed as an interruption, but an essential storytelling device that all Indian movie-goers have adapted themselves to,” said Rathie.

Take the intermission scene in “RRR,” where Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.) unleashes a bunch of animals at a party hosted by Britishers. Just when the tension peaks, the screen cuts to black, leaving the audience at this pivotal cliffhanger. This is a classic example of how director S.S. Rajamouli intentionally designed the shocker for the interval point, ensuring the audience actively engages in mid-movie conversations about what’s to come. In an amusing twist, during a March 25, 2022 screening of “RRR” at Cinemark North Hollywood, only the first half of the movie was shown. The theater staff, oblivious to the concept of Indian intermissions, assumed the movie had ended.

“Because of cultural conditioning, Indian audiences cannot fathom an interval-free viewing, which is why Hollywood films always have an intermission, too, in Indian cinema halls, whether the director likes it or not. In fact, the conditioning is so strong that movie-goers will instinctively rise and head straight to the popcorn counter,” said Girish Johar, an Indian film producer and distributor who has worked on the distribution and marketing of Hollywood films through collaborations with major studios such as Columbia Tristar, Sony, Warner Bros., and Lionsgate.

Ironically, Hollywood is no stranger to intermissions. “Gone with the Wind,” “Lawrence of Arabia,” and “Ben Hur” famously featured scheduled intermissions due to their long running times and limitations of single-reel film projections. But due to advancements in projection technology and the ability to squeeze in more screenings per day (which equals to more ticket sales), American cinemas eliminated intermissions altogether. India, however, took a different route — choosing to capitalize on the booming “popcorn economy.”

So how does the business of intervals work? Rathie said, “It is the studios that decide. When the studios process the movies for release in India, they pre-insert intervals before it is screened nationwide. That way, no matter which cinema hall you walk into anywhere in the country, the interval, however abrupt, will happen at the exact same point.” Johar noted that this may not be the case for all Hollywood films, adding, “For independently acquired films from markets such as Singapore, France or Hong Kong, the exhibitors determine the exact interval time.”

Devang Sampat, managing director of Cinepolis India, which operates 449 screens across the country, points out the balancing act that comes with determining intervals as exhibitors. “While some films present a challenge due to their structure, we strive to find a natural pause that aligns with the film’s rhythm.” However, the audience may not always be aligned, as Sampat recalled that for movies such as “Dunkirk” and “Joker: Folie à Deux,” theaters received complaints and requests to shift the interval timing.

Christopher Nolan has long advocated for his films to be experienced without any interruptions, and “Oppenheimer,” despite its three-hour length, was meant to be enjoyed in a single sitting. But In India, even Nolan’s movies were not spared.

Johar, however, said that exceptions could be made, but they are exceedingly rare. “If a movie has a clear directive from a major, Oscar-winning Hollywood director or studio, sometimes the exhibitor may budge. Only a director with a major clout could make such demands. Even then, exhibitors are unlikely to comply as it is seen as impractical to hold audiences captive without a break. If Nolan couldn’t break this pattern, I do not know who will.”

After all, the decision is not personal — it is purely commercial (and to some extent, cultural).

Sampat echoed a similar sentiment; “There have been cases where studios or directors have expressed a preference for an uninterrupted screening. During such instances, we evaluate options that best balance the studio’s vision with audience preferences.” But given the average Indian audience’s expectations, an intermission is inevitable.

With recent films such as “Dune: Part Two,” “Gladiator II,” “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” and “Wicked” stretching beyond the two-and-half-hour mark, industry insiders feel that Indian audiences, conditioned (since several decades) by Indian blockbusters that often exceed three hours, have come to expect intermissions. The intermission is now a welcome part of the viewing experience, regardless of the film’s origin.

Rathie added that many Hollywood studios have accepted this as a part of the localization process and the country’s unique theater-going experience. “Accepting intermissions is another way of localization, similar to adding subtitles or dubbing movies in multiple regional languages. Nolan will never restrict the release of his film in India on the pretext that it has a forced interval,” said Rathie.

But do Nolan and Scorsese know their movies are getting interrupted? “Of course they do. All Hollywood studios know how the Indian market functions. And they even know there is nothing much that can be done about it,” said Johar.

In India, even the world’s most visionary filmmakers cannot outrun the inevitable intermission. One-take monologues are sliced in half, plot twists pause mid-gasp, and a car chase sequence screeches to a halt. The lights come up, and the spell breaks. Because in Indian theaters, the intermission remains undefeated.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,Denzel Washington Has ‘Absolutely’ Been in Talks for an ‘Othello’ Film Adaptation,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/denzel-washington-othello-film-adaptation-1235110933/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 21:00:00 GMT","Denzel Washington may be bringing his version of “Othello” to the screen.

Washington stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the Broadway play, which has been in previews since February 24. “Othello” opened March 23 and runs through June 8. The play already broke the record for the highest weekly gross ever by earning $2.8 million in its second week. Now, director Kenny Leon is teasing that the historic Shakespeare retelling could lead to a film.

Leon told The Hollywood Reporter that there has “absolutely” been talks with Washington about adapting the play into a feature. Leon previously has collaborated with Washington on two other plays, “A Raisin in the Sun” and “Fences,” which Washington then later directed the film version of. When asked if Gyllenhaal would also potentially reprise his role for an “Othello” film, Leon said, “I would hope so, absolutely, that’s what I would hope would happen.”

Leon’s “Othello” is set in “The Near Future,” with Iago (Gyllenhaal) manipulating the titular Othello (Washington) into thinking that his wife, Desdemona (Molly Osborne), is having an affair. This is the first Broadway production of “Othello” in more than 40 years, though Daniel Craig and David Oyelowo co-starred in a staging at New York Theatre Workshop off-Broadway between 2016 and 2017.

“It’s important for today because, for 100s of years, we’re still dealing with ourselves. Humanity is still struggling with itself,” Leon said. “This play is about pure love but what happens to pure love when there’s rumors and lies and jealousy. And all that’s timely for every generation.”

He added that a play and a film are “two different art forms” but the story of “Othello” will have “the same truth” in either form. “We’re trying to get this up first,” Leon said of the play.

The Variety review cited the respective star power of Washington and Gyllenhaal onstage. “These scenes capitalize on all 70 of Washington’s years on this Earth, as he looms over Desdemona and speaks with an authority his misguided beliefs have not earned,” the review reads. “That Washingtonian authority demonstrates the production’s one big idea — to place two big stars at the center of the stage and trust that their talent and charisma will carry the day. And, for the most part, they do; no fan of Washington or of Gyllenhaal will leave disappointed in the actors. Leon lets his two stars cook, but hasn’t stocked the production with anything to give what they’re doing any flavor.”

Washington recently led another Shakespeare film adaptation, Joel Coen’s 2021 feature “The Tragedy of Macbeth.” He will next star in Spike Lee’s “Highest 2 Lowest.”

“Othello” has been brought to the screen before, most (in)famously with the 1965 version which starred Laurence Olivier as the titular character. Olivier received an Oscar nomination for his performance; however, he was in blackface to play Othello.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,"The British TV Industry Is In Such Crisis, ‘Wolf Hall’ Director Says, That ITV and BBC Couldn’t Afford ‘Adolescence’",https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/wolf-hall-director-itv-bbc-adolescence-1235110877/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 20:30:00 GMT","From “Baby Reindeer” to “Adolescence,” Netflix has staked a claim when it comes to sourcing prestige British TV with global appeal and “Wolf Hall” director Peter Kominsky believes this to be a huge problem. Speaking during a recent interview with BBC Two’s Newsnight, the 45-year industry veteran detailed what he described as an “existential crisis” facing Britain’s public broadcasting.

Kominsky explained that American streaming companies have made costs so high that BBC, ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5 “can’t afford to make dramas like ‘Wolf Hall’ anymore.” Instead, all the money that should be distributed on British programming is going to shows that have more global appeal, “Adolescence” being one example.

“I think the BBC or ITV would wish to make ‘Adolescence,’ but let’s be absolutely clear,” Kominsky said, “there is no way they could make it at the moment.”

Written by this year’s Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay, Peter Straughan (“Conclave”), the second adaptation of Hilary Mantel’s popular literary series, “The Mirror and the Light,” was almost shut down six weeks before production. Even after props had been made, locations scouted, and cast members contracted, Kominsky and the show’s producer realized the budget they were provided with simply wouldn’t work.

“That’s not something that has ever happened to me before,” Kominsky said, “in all the years I’ve been making programmes, that you actually have to stop six weeks from production.”

Ultimately, Kominsky had to solve the problem by shooting most of the show indoors to save on the costs that would accrue from trying to control the lighting of any outdoor environment, but having to sacrifice quality for budgetary reasons was anathema to his nature as a craftsperson. Even Straughan and the show’s star, Mark Rylance, agreed to take huge pay cuts in order to see the show made.

In a letter written to Members of Parliament on the Culture, Media, and Sport Committee earlier this year, Kominsky laid out a strategy to bring more financing to U.K.-focused narratives by enacting a 5% streaming levy. The profits from this would then go into a “cultural fund” for British programming without inherent “cross-border appeal.”

“A British TV (body), with its self-financing cultural fund, would be brought into existence entirely to address this market failure,” Kominsky wrote in his letter. “Its criterion wouldn’t be profit, it would be excellence. And our culture would be richer for it”

https://indiewire.com,Nathan Lane Lost Out on ‘Space Jam’ Role Because Director Thought He Was ‘Too Gay to Play the Part’,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/nathan-lane-space-jam-too-gay-1235110893/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 20:00:00 GMT","Nathan Lane‘s star-making, Golden Globe-nominated turn in 1996 film “The Birdcage” didn’t have as much of an impact as the actor thought it would. Lane detailed how he actually lost out on roles — specifically one of which was “Space Jam” — after leading the comedy about a proud queer couple forced back into closet for the benefit of their heteronormative son and his would-be fiancée’s conservative family.

Lane has previously said that he was “not prepared at all” to publicly come out as gay when “The Birdcage” was released and was “terrified” of being outed at the time; he later came out in 1999. Yet “Space Jam” director Joe Pytka allegedly deemed Lane “too gay” to star as Michael Jordan’s assistant in the film, which was also released in 1996. Wayne Knight instead was cast.

“I was up for that part,” Lane told Vanity Fair. “Apparently the director [Joe Pytka] saw me hosting the Tony Awards and thought that suggested I was too gay to play the part. So thank God, I didn’t have to do ‘Space Jam.’ But I don’t know. I’ll never know what people say. Homophobia is alive and well, still.”

IndieWire has reached out to representatives for Pytka.

Lane added of the challenges “The Birdcage” brought to his career, “I don’t know what goes on behind closed doors, but I can’t help but think that it played a part. I was told it did impact a movie that I didn’t really care about: ‘Space Jam.’ I was up for the part that the guy from ‘Seinfeld’ [Wayne Knight] wound up playing.”

Even Lane’s (now former) agent at the time warned him against being out.

“In the beginning I never really pursued film. I always thought theater was a more interesting place to be, because you learn more about acting that way. Movies were just to pay the bills so I could keep doing theater. Then ‘The Birdcage’ came along. I thought perhaps because of the success of that, it’d lead to other films, but then it didn’t. It really didn’t. I said to my agent, ‘I thought more would happen after ‘The Birdcage.’ He said, ‘Maybe if you weren’t so open about your lifestyle, it would have,'” Lane said. “Yeah — and he was an old queen telling me this. So I left him. […] There weren’t a lot of opportunities.”

“The Birdcage” director Mike Nichols instead helped Lane find new representation at CAA. Still, Lane — who is now starring in series “Mid-Century Modern” — says that “Hollywood figured out nothing when it comes to me” in terms of casting, even if he has appeared in more unique fare lately.

“That was just an A24 moment with a couple of very out-there films [‘Beau Is Afraid’ and ‘Dicks: The Musical’]. I wish they’d figured out what to do with me,” Lane said. “I’ve been able to, I think, shift the perception a bit about me, but there’s always going to be that ‘He’s from the theater’ thing. It’s either homophobia or it’s just, ‘He gives big performances because he comes from the theater.’ If they give me a chance, I seem to do well — but you have to get the part. You need a part to prove that. I gave up long ago trying to pursue it.”

He continued, “There’ve been times I’ve been up for something and then it didn’t happen. And you think, ‘Oh, OK. Well, that would’ve been a nice opportunity.’ Especially of late, I’ve been very, very fortunate and working a lot. I have a couple more in the theater I’d like to do. There’s a couple more mountains I want to climb before I hang up my shingle. […] Before I die, it would be lovely to get to play a juicy, serious supporting role in some film. That’s why I’m very grateful to Ryan Murphy. He let me play Dominic Dunne [in ‘The Mendendez Brothers’] and F. Lee Bailey [in ‘The People v. O. J. Simpson’]. I mean, things are great. I don’t want it to seem like I don’t have a really terrific, enviable career.”

Abraham on Monday, March 24 posted that Ballal was “lynched” by a group of settlers, presumably referring to Israeli settlers living on Palestinian land in the West Bank, and was then arrested by soldiers who “invaded” his ambulance. He added there has been no sign of Ballal since.

“A group of settlers just lynched Hamdan Ballal, co-director of our film ‘No Other Land.’ They beat him and he has injuries in his head and stomach, bleeding. Soldiers invaded the ambulance he called, and took him. No sign of him since,” Abraham posted on X.

In a subsequent post written in Hebrew and translated via X, Abraham said, “A group of settlers attacked the home of Hamdan Ballal, who directed the Oscar-winning film ‘No Other Land’ with me. They beat him in the head and all over his body. While wounded and bleeding, soldiers entered the ambulance he had called and arrested him. He has since disappeared and it is unclear whether he is receiving medical treatment or what is happening to him.”

The film’s other co-director Basel Adra also shared a photo from the scene, saying he was with Ballal’s 7-year-old son.

‘I’m standing with Karam, Hamdan’s 7-year-old son, near the blood of Hamdan’s in his house, after settlers lynched him. Hamdan, co-director of our film ‘No Other Land,’ is still missing after soldiers abducted him, injured and bleeding. This is how they erase Masafer Yatta,” Adra wrote.

Ballal is a Palestinian photographer and farmer from Susya, which is a settlement in Area C of the West Bank. Ballal just six hours prior to Abraham’s post on X shared a photo and caption on Instagram from Susya, which described another settler attack against three Palestinian shepherds and showed a photo of a shepherd who he said was hospitalized with a head and ear injury caused by a stone. He wrote in a separate post from a week prior that Susya is “under continuous terrorist attacks” including 10 different severe assaults reported since the start of 2025.

Shortly after his initial post, Abraham shared another disturbing video of a masked man who he claimed was part of the “lynch mob” that attacked Ballal’s village, adding that his location is still unknown. The video shows the man attacking a group of presumably American activists (it’s unclear why the activists are in the region), cracking their car’s windshield with a stone.

“No Other Land” won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature earlier this month, where Abraham and Ballal were both in attendance along with their other co-director Basel Adra. The film has been in the news again of late after the Mayor of Miami Beach called on a local art house theater to stop screening the film, believing it to be antisemitic, and sparking a public outcry.

https://indiewire.com,Pixar’s Pete Docter Says ‘Toy Story’ Was an Unexpected Hit: We Were All ‘Nerds’ Making It in Our ‘Garage’,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/toy-story-30-anniversary-pixar-pete-docter-nerds-1235110883/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 19:00:00 GMT","Pete Docter, the co-chief creative officer of Pixar, is reflecting on being one of the so-called “nerds” who revolutionized animation filmmaking with “Toy Story.” Oscar-winning Docter was the supervising animator on the iconic 1995 film, which marks its 30th anniversary this year. He was later appointed co-chief creative officer of Pixar and Disney Animation Studios alongside Jennifer Lee in 2018.

“The fact that [‘Toy Story’] hit the popular culture was never [expected],” Docter told The Hollywood Reporter. “Working on it, it was just a bunch of us nerds. It felt like working in our garage. It was a whole rental space, not really fancy and a small team, so it was very casual and loose.”

And three decades later, Docter is “still amazed” at the film’s legacy, even if he believes it looks a little outdated amid the technological advances in animation.

“It’s on the top bunch of movies on Disney+,” Docter said. “Thirty years later you look at it, and to be honest, it sort of looks like a video game now given how far computer animation has come. But I think that’s just a testament to the great acting; that we had both great actors, the voice actors, and the animation is kind of all over the map, but it was enough there to get people to fall in love with the characters. It’s crazy to think it’s been nearly 30 years.”

“Toy Story” is credited with shifting the U.S. market for animated films. Docter described how the goal was to start a family friendly franchise that was accessible to both kids and adults. “Toy Story” definitely did that and more: The film earned a a total of $394.4 million worldwide and landed three sequels and spinoff “Lightyear.” “Toy Story 5” is now in the works, with “Wall-E” and “Finding Nemo” Academy Award winner Andrew Stanton writing and directing.

“[It] was important to us at the time when ‘Toy Story’ came out, there wasn’t a lot of films that did that. There were a lot of them that were like four kids and nothing really other than maybe from Japan or something for adults. And so our goal was to, in the same way Spielberg did with ‘Indiana Jones’ and ‘Star Wars’ with George Lucas, we’d love to bring animation into something that we as 20-, 30-year olds can enjoy,” Docter said, adding that the film was a “real game changer for a lot of my peers that studied hand-drawn animation.”

Docter continued, “I pictured, I’d be sitting at a desk drawing Mickey Mouse and instead I’m with a mouse and I’m moving a puppet virtually in screen. And people were like, ‘What?’ at that time. And now that’s become a commonplace. Even ‘Toy Story’ to ‘Toy Story 4,’ the level of visual sophistication, including the pacing, we’re just trying to keep in touch with the rhythms of the world and it’s definitely faster.”

“Toy Story 5” will continue that trend of modernity, according to Docter.

“Andrew’s done a really great job of letting moments breathe in unexpected ways. Things that you’re like, wait, is this a ‘Toy Story’ movie? Just some of his choices, which I think we need at this point. We’ve had four of ’em already. We got to keep people surprised, so it’s going to be fun,” he said. “I think we are at a place now where two, three generations have grown up on ‘Toy Story’ specifically. And so what’s going to be new and surprising to them, I think we’re always trying to reach for that. We’ve got some cool stuff in the works that is an attempt to answer that question in our way, but I think it’ll be really interesting.”",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,‘The White Lotus’ Episode 6 Review: What a Tangled (and Incestuous) Web We Weave,https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/shows/the-white-lotus-episode-6-review-1235110388/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 02:00:00 GMT","Editor’s Note: This article contains spoilers for “The White Lotus” Season 3, Episode 6, “Denials.”

What’s that saying? Here’s to the nights you barely remember, and the disturbing details you can’t forget! A perfectly accurate expression for Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger) and Lochlan (Sam Nivola) in “The White Lotus,” who wake up groggy in Episode 6, “Denials,” and go on to remember that they partook not only of drugs and alcohol but also incest.

Mike White‘s series might start and end with a death every season, but the show is and always has been a social satire, with both family and sexual dynamics included in that commentary — so why not combine the two, and on the top network for incest? Episode 6’s revelations put the viewer very much in Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) and Chelsea’s (Aimee Lou Wood) POV, assessing the brothers’ overall dynamic with morbid fascination. Is this the result of Saxon’s confusing sexual energy? Is it a younger brother’s drive to make everyone happy? Is it just the drugs and the booze and the moon? And most importantly of all — will they ever talk about what happened?

Sexual revelations (and denials) abound in this episode. Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) wakes up in bed with Pornchai (Dom Hetrakul), only for her son to open the door, and Kate (Leslie Bibb) sees Valentin (Arnas Fedaravicius) sneaking out of Jaclyn’s (Michelle Monaghan) room early in the morning. The former goes as well as possible, with Zion (Nicholas Duvernay) laughing it off and expressing happiness for Belinda — a single mother who Rothwell said is “his everything.”

“There’s a real friendship there, but there’s also this unending love, where they will fight for each other, fight with each other, and fight together,” Rothwell told IndieWire ahead of Season 3.

As for Pornchai, Rothwell said, “It’s pretty special to be able to find someone who sees you. It’s not uncommon for there to be workplace romances, and because when you’re doing something that you love, and someone else is doing that same thing, and they also love it, you feel validated. I think he gives to her. He wants to support her. I think she spends the better part of her life giving to other people, supporting her son, working at The White Lotus in Maui, and there’s a depletion that happens. She comes to Thailand, and he wants to fill her cup — in many ways.”

The morning news goes down less smoothly in the ladies’ villa, where it rankles Laurie (Carrie Coon) to start saying the quiet parts out loud. She calls Jaclyn “pathetic” (not to her face) for thriving on male attention, judges her marriage, and barely conceals her resentment while asking her friend to dish about Valentin. The three actors deliver sharply subtle performances, from Laurie’s passive aggression to Jaclyn’s actual aggression and Kate’s dismay as the de facto mediator.

“I think her life has felt very stressful and unsatisfying for a long time, and so she finally is having the girls trip she was hoping for,” Coon told Indiewire. “But then, of course, it’s ‘The White Lotus,’ so you’re not gonna end on a high note, and it’s really painful.”

“She asserts that this is something Jaclyn has always done, and whether that’s real or her perception of what Jaclyn has always done — in some ways, it doesn’t matter,” she added. “The storytelling is the storytelling, and she believes it, and it’s the thing that is affecting her most.”

“But also she doesn’t admit it!” Coon said. Bibb, seated next to her, piped in quietly in true Kate fashion: “Is it that big of a deal?”

Only time (and the next two episodes) will tell.

Lizzo will play Sister Rosetta Tharpe in a musical biopic based on Tharpe’s life, an individual with knowledge of the project told IndieWire.

The film, titled “Rosetta,” is currently in development for Amazon MGM Studios, and Lizzo is also producing the project alongside Kevin Beisler, as well as Nina Yang Bongiovi and Forest Whitaker for their banner Significant Productions. The film will be written by Natalie Chaidez (“The Flight Attendant,” “Queen of the South”) and Kwynn Perry (“Tigerbelles,” “The Burned Photo”). No director is attached.

Sister Rosetta Tharpe began her career in the ’30s with her gospel recordings and gained popularity by the ’40s, one of the first to blend gospel sounds with the electric guitar. But she became a true trailblazer who inspired countless rock legends, including Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Johnny Cash, and many more. Dubbed the “Godmother of Rock & Roll,” she was among the first to use heavy distortion on her electric guitar and helped pave the way for the classic blues sound. She also famously toured with Muddy Waters in the ’60s across Europe, inspiring other guitarists like Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, and Jeff Beck. Rolling Stone named her the sixth best guitarist of all time.

The film specifically focuses on how Tharpe, born Rosetta Nubin, needed to conceal her love for another woman and ultimately hosted her wedding inside a baseball stadium in 1951 in front of 20,000 strangers, turning the occasion into effectively the first stadium concert. We’ll see if Sister Rosetta suddenly also learns how to play the flute just as Lizzo has become known for.

As an actress, Lizzo had a mini breakout in “Hustlers” back in 2019, and she also has appeared in episodes of “The Mandalorian” and “The Simpsons.” She’s already halfway to an EGOT, as in addition to four Grammys, she won an Emmy for her 2022 reality program “Watch Out For the Big Grrrls,” which also appeared on Amazon Prime Video. Lizzo has a new album coming out this year and recently released new singles “Still Bad” and “Love in Real Life.”

Over 60 films came into this year’s Sundance looking for homes. As we previously reported, the hope was that even more distributors could get creative.

Below we’ll update all the acquisitions following the festival as they arrive. Here are the movies we think could sell big.

“Predators”

Section: U.S. Documentary

Buyer: MTV Documentary Films

Director: David Osit

Buzz: Another one of our favorite docs out of Sundance, this chilling investigation into Dateline’s “To Catch a Predator” series from Peabody-winning director Osit looks into the complicated legacy of the hit show by arguing that we as viewers are complicit in America’s “perverted sense of justice,” as IndieWire’s review wrote. In conversation with the director, Osit said the original series delighted in “the pain of other people.” MTV Documentary Films picked up the worldwide rights to the film and is planning on giving it an awards push later in 2025, starting with a screening internationally at CPH:DOX, a theatrical push, and then a spot on Paramount+ with Showtime. “Predators” is directed, produced, edited, and filmed by David Osit, produced by Jamie Gonçalves and Kellen Quinn, edited by Nicolás Nørgaard Staffolani, and executive produced by Jennifer Ollman and co-executive produced by Arthur Bradford and Chad Beck. The film is presented by Sweet Relief Productions (“Casa Bonita Mi Amor”) in association with Rosewater Pictures.

“Kiss of the Spider Woman”

Section: Premieres

Buyer: Roadside Attractions, Lionsgate, LD Entertainment

Director: Bill Condon

Cast: Jennifer Lopez, Diego Luna, Tonatiuh

Buzz: This one took a while to close despite the star power, and that’s because it’s such an oddly huge movie to have premiered at Sundance in the first place. Roadside Attractions, Lionsgate, and LD Entertainment are in final negotiations to acquire the film, IndieWire has learned, but an official deal still hasn’t solidified. The musical adaptation of the 1993 stage play (before that a book and a narrative feature starring William Hurt in 1985) was produced by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck’s Artists Equity for a reported $30 million budget and demanded a big commitment, and even this acquisition is just for domestic rights.

“Oh, Hi!”

Section: Premieres

Buyer: Sony Pictures Classics

Director: Sophie Brooks

Cast: Molly Gordon, Logan Lerman, Geraldine Viswanathan, John Reynolds

Buzz: SPC nabbed the worldwide rights to director Sophie Brooks’ sophomore feature, a big commitment to the Molly Gordon-led indie comedy that took some time to sell and find the right home. “Oh, Hi!” stars Gordon as Iris as she and and Isaac (Lerman) have their first romantic weekend getaway as a couple, only for it to go awry. Convinced that he’s just confused, Iris goes to extreme lengths to prove to him that they are meant to be together. Brooks told IndieWire the film is a “love letter to the hopeless romantic,” so SPC is crossing its fingers for a commercial hit. The film was produced by David Brooks, Dan Clifton, Julie Waters, Sophie Brooks, and Molly Gordon. Evan Dyal, Justin Brown, and Evan Moore are executive producers alongside Sabina Friedman-Seitz, Molly Quinn, Matthew M. Welty, and Elan Gale.

“Dead Lover”

Section: Midnight

Buyer: Cartuna x Dweck

Director: Grace Glowicki

Cast: Grace Glowicki, Ben Petrie

Buzz: Though it sold out of SXSW, “Dead Lover” first premiered at Sundance. It was scooped up by a brand new distributor, a team-up between physical media company Cartuna and production company Dweck Productions as the boutique’s first release. Read more here.

‘East of Wall’ Courtesy Sundance Institute

“East of Wall”

Section: NEXT

Buyer: Sony Pictures Classics

Director: Kate Beecroft

Cast: Tabatha Zimiga, Porshia Zimiga, Scoot McNairy, Jennifer Ehle

Buzz: Winning the Audience Award in the NEXT section at Sundance, IndieWire adored Kate Beecroft’s debut as a portrait of the modern American West as captured through a docu-fiction film that blends genres. Stars Tabatha Zimiga and Porshia Zimiga play themselves in the film alongside two acting heavyweights in McNairy and Ehle, and the film follows echoes the real life of a young horse trainer wrestling with financial insecurity and grief while providing refuge for a group of wayward teenagers on her ranch in the South Dakota Badlands. SPC acquired worldwide rights to the project with the likelihood of giving it another festival push later in the year. “East of Wall” is a Station Road & Stetson’s Kingdom Production in association with Picture Movers, Stadium, Working Barn Productions, Low Road Films and Tan Bark Pictures.

“OBEX”

Section: NEXT

Buyer: Oscilloscope

Director: Albert Birney

Cast: Albert Birney, Callie Hernandez

Buzz: In a slow Sundance, it’s good to see some of the smaller titles get some love. Oscilloscope’s acquisition of Birney’s “OBEX” will give the film a theatrical release later this year, and it’ll even be shopped to international buyers at the European Film Market occurring this month (Magnify is selling globally). That’s a plus considering IndieWire in its review called it one of Sundance’s “weirdest and most inventive movies” this year that’s destined for Midnight Movie status. The black-and-white period film borrows from ’80s kitschy aesthetic and is a cross between the late David Lynch’s “Eraserhead” and playing a “Legend of Zelda” game. It stars Birney as a man whose reality starts to blur with fantasy when he begins playing a computer game, forcing him to track down his dog that has now gone missing. This is the first film Birney directed solo, but he co-wrote it with Pete Ohs, who also produced and was the cinematographer and has his own film debuting at SXSW next month. Other producers are Emma Hannaway and James Belfer, the founder of Cartuna who helped make “Hundreds of Beavers” an indie smash last year.

“Lurker”

Section: U.S. Dramatic

Buyer: MUBI

Director: Alex Russell

Cast: Archie Madekwe, Théodore Pellerin

Buzz: Another competitive situation with multiple distributors in on it, this time it was MUBI that won out in a reported mid-seven-figure deal, a source told IndieWire. Russell’s “Lurker” played in competition at Sundance and earned raves for the performances of Madekwe and Pellerin, and IndieWire called the film “tense and absorbing” and one of the buzzier movies to play at the festival. The film follows a man who becomes obsessed with a budding pop star, sparking a toxic relationship that makes a pointed commentary about modern day Los Angeles. Russell is a supervising producer on both “The Bear” and “Beef” and made his directorial debut on the project. Madekwe also produced the film alongside Alex Orlovsky, Duncan Montomery, Galen Core, Francesco Melzi D’Eril, Jack Selby, Marc Marrie, Charlie McDowell, and Olmo Schnabel.

“The Perfect Neighbor”

Section: U.S. Documentary

Buyer: Netflix

Director: Geeta Gandbhir

Buzz: The first documentary to sell out of what has been a slow Sundance market is this film about the controversial Florida “Stand Your Ground” law, in which a person inside their home has the right to use deadly force, with no need to retreat, in self-defense. Netflix will pick up “The Perfect Neighbor” for $5 million, according to a report first in Variety. Netflix declined to comment. Gandbhir’s film is constructed via police body cam footage and examines gun regulations and how race plays a factor in such decisions. IndieWire’s review called it an “unforgettable” and “devastatingly powerful” documentary.

“Peter Hujar’s Day”

Section: Premieres

Buyer: Sideshow and Janus Films

Director: Ira Sachs

Cast: Ben Whishaw, Rebecca Hall

Buzz: Ira Sachs’ latest may be just a 75-minute filmed version of a 50-year-old transcript of a conversation between Peter Hujar and his friend Linda Rosenkrantz, but it found the ideal home with Sideshow and Janus, who will bring it to Berlin next and then release the movie theatrically in the fall after acquiring all North American rights. IndieWire fell in love with its surprising drama and intimacy, and Sachs was almost just as surprised, telling IndieWire at Sundance that before filming he asked himself, “what the hell do I do with this?” The film was produced by Jordan Drake and Jonah Disend, and co-produced by Fred Burle and Aaron Craig.

‘Sorry, Baby’

“Sorry, Baby”

Section: U.S. Dramatic Competition

Buyer: A24

Director: Eva Victor

Cast: Eva Victor, Naomi Ackie, John Carroll Lynch, Louis Cancelmi, Kelly McCormack

Buzz: Winner of the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award, Eva Victor’s tragi-comic debut was one of the most talked-about narrative features at Sundance and one that indie powerhouse A24 couldn’t pass up, not to mention one of the best-reviewed titles from the festival. Despite sales taking some time this Sundance, the sale for “Sorry, Baby” to A24 — which is still in the process of closing — was described by a source as “incredibly competitive” and is another worldwide deal for the indie distributor. The social media star and comedian Eva Victor’s debut, which she wrote, directed, and starred in, is about Agnes, whom “something bad happened to,” as the logline describes, “But life goes on…for everyone around her, at least.” The producers are Adele Romanski, Mark Ceryak, and Barry Jenkins.

“Train Dreams”

Section: Premieres

Buyer: Netflix

Director: Clint Bentley

Cast: Joel Edgerton, Felicity Jones, William H. Macy, Kerry Condon

Buzz: A day after Bela Bajaria responded to a press question about whether or not this was a slow Sundance, Netflix swooped in to buy one of the more ambitious titles on the Sundance slate, director Clint Bentley’s period drama “Train Dreams,” multiple sources confirmed to IndieWire. The film reunites Bentley with “Sing Sing” partner Greg Kwedar in adapting Denis Johnson’s novella. The film follows Robert Grainer, an average man living in extraordinary times, who worked as a day laborer in the American West at the beginning of the 20th century. Battered by the death of his family, he struggles to adjust to this new environment. Marissa McMahon, Teddy Schwarzman, Will Janowitz, Ashley Schlaifer, and Michael Heimler produced. Edgerton was also an EP along with Scott Hinckley, Kwedar, and John Friedberg. Black Bear produced and fully financed the film, and Kamala Films also produced.

‘Together’ Neon

“Together”

Section: Midnight

Buyer: Neon

Director: Michael Shanks

Cast: Alison Brie, Dave Franco

Buzz: It’s the first — and only — big deal of the festival so far, one of the rare titles this year that attracted a classic, aggressive bidding war following its Sunday night premiere at the Eccles. Neon beat out other bidders including A24 and Searchlight to release the film, with a source saying the deal was likely north of $10 million and another estimate coming in between $15-17 million, which would make it among the highest deals in Sundance history. Neon’s financing outfit 30West was also behind this one, making it a good fit. “Together,” director Michael Shanks’ body horror film, is about a married couple whose relationship is already being tested and who decides to move to the countryside to get closer, only for a supernatural encounter to grant them their wish in spades — and in flesh. Stars and producers Brie and Franco are a real life married couple, so the film has a meta element that made this one especially juicy. Neon picked up worldwide rights and has already set a release date of August 1 in theaters.

“The Reality of Hope”

Section: Documentary Short Film Program

Buyer: Asteria and Documentary+

Director: Joe Hunting

Buzz: Ahead of its premiere on Saturday, Jan. 25, AI animation studio Asteria and the documentary free streaming platform Documentary+ swooped in to acquire this doc short that blends VR and live action filmmaking. The film follows Hiyu, a virtual reality world builder based in Stockholm who is suffering from kidney failure and is set to get a transplant from a friend, New York-based Photographotter, who he knows only through an online VR community where they’re each seen as an animal “furry” avatar. Doc+ will release the film later this year on its AVOD platform and through its various FAST channels. Asteria’s Bryn Mooser and Justin Lacob are joining the project as executive producers.

“One to One: John and Yoko”

Section: Spotlight

Buyer: Magnolia

Director: Kevin MacDonald

Buzz: First premiering at the Venice Film Festival and then at Telluride, Magnolia bought “One to One” just ahead of its Sundance screening and made a splash to give it an IMAX exclusive release on April 11, the first time Magnolia has partnered with IMAX on a release. It will then land on Max and HBO in late 2025. The film follows the 18 months that John Lennon and Yoko Ono spent living in Greenwich Village in the early 1970s, including restored footage from the only full concert Lennon performed after breaking up from The Beatles, the One to One Madison Square Garden benefit concert. The film has an audio restoration as overseen by Sean Lennon Ono.

https://indiewire.com,George Clooney Doesn’t Want to ‘Compete with 25-Year-Old Leading Men’ for Rom-Com Roles: ‘That’s Not My Job’,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/george-clooney-rom-com-retired-1235110853/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:00:00 GMT","George Clooney is stepping away from one genre of film for good: rom-coms.

The actor said during CBS‘ “60 Minutes” that he will no longer be leading “romantic films” and instead is just fine with younger stars taking on lead roles. “Look, I’m 63 years old,” the Oscar winner said. “I’m not trying to compete with 25-year-old leading men. That’s not my job. I’m not doing romantic films anymore.”

Clooney instead is focusing on his Broadway debut with the “Good Night, and Good Luck” stage adaptation. Clooney co-wrote and directed the film in 2005 based on the true story of Edward R. Murrow battling the McCarthyism blacklists. Clooney admitted, though, that starring on Broadway is “trickier the older you get,” despite taking years for him to believe he was ready for the stage.

“I didn’t do the work required to get there,” he said. “There isn’t a single actor alive that wouldn’t have loved to have, you know, been on Broadway. So that’s the fun of it,” Clooney said. “It’s trickier the older you get. But why not?”

As for his rom-com retirement, Clooney seems to have had his final romantic role in 2022 rom-com film “Ticket to Paradise” opposite his frequent collaborator Julia Roberts. Clooney told The New York Times at the time that it had been 28 years since he has acted in a rom-com film (apparently not counting “Intolerable Cruelty” in 2003).

“They sent me the script [for ‘Ticket to Paradise‘], and it was clearly written for Julia and I,” Clooney said in a joint interview with co-star and fellow “Ticket to Paradise” executive producer Roberts. “In fact, the characters’ names were originally Georgia and Julian. I hadn’t really done a romantic comedy since ‘One Fine Day’ [in 1996] — I haven’t succeeded like Julia has in that forum — but I read it and thought, ‘Well, if Jules is up for it, I think this could be fun.’”

“Pretty Woman” actress Roberts added that “Ticket to Paradise” could have been a “disaster” if Clooney didn’t sign on to play her onscreen ex-husband. Thankfully, he did.

And age seems to be top of mind for Clooney, who also later told The New York Times in 2024 that the “Ocean’s Thirteen” sequel will reference how much the ensemble cast has aged since the prior installment. “It’s like we’re all too old to do the jobs we used to be able to do,” Clooney said.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,"Seth Rogen on Nabbing the Wildest Cameos in ‘The Studio,’ from Olivia Wilde to Film Reporter Matt Belloni",https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/seth-rogen-the-studio-cameos-1235110830/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 14:30:00 GMT","The upcoming Apple TV+ comedy series “The Studio” could be the streamer’s next big hit — or its most inside baseball, er, inside industry show ever.

Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg co-created the 10-episode series, where Rogen stars as ambitious — and prone-to-pratfalling — producer Matt Remick. He’s the newly appointed head of the fictional Continental Studios, tasked with churning out studio slop like a Kool-Aid movie meant to capitalize on Mattel’s growing reign in Hollywood. Or asking “Smile” and “Smile 2” director Parker Finn to direct a movie called “Wink,” which is basically the same concept as those horror movies but with a, well, wink instead of a lethal smile. “It’s not a formula so much as a structure that we know 100 percent works so we’re going to do it over and over again,” Matt explains at one point of the company’s ethos.

Each episode of the series (launching March 26) includes at least one filmmaker cameo that will amuse film fans, like Matt crushing Martin Scorsese’s dreams of making a movie about Jim Jones by trying to turn that trenchant script of cult mass murder into his for-hire Kool-Aid movie (since that was, after all, what killed Jonestownians anyway). Charlize Theron, Ron Howard, Zoë Kravitz, Olivia Wilde, Sarah Polley, Parker Finn, Ted Sarandos, Scorsese, and many more all appear playing themselves throughout the series, and IndieWire recently spoke to Rogen about some of the most unexpected cameos and how he nabbed them.

“We were very lucky. We wrote ourselves into very specific corners with a lot of these roles. Those are both great examples [Olivia Wilde and Parker Finn] where we needed someone for Olivia, where you believe a studio would be very excited to work [with her]. Someone who’s made big movies with big stars but has an allure to them, and someone who themselves is a star, so it would make my character even more willing to buy their line of bullshit a little bit and look past some of the red flags,” Rogen said.

‘The Studio‘ Apple TV Plus

Wilde eventually appears as a volatile filmmaker who goes rogue on the set of her latest film, where the episode becomes a noir detective story about who stole a missing reel. But Wilde and the series may also be implicitly playing with the persona she was rumored to have developed while filming on the set of “Don’t Worry Darling,” accused in tabloids and reports of clashing with star Florence Pugh while having a fling with Harry Styles — lest you blocked out all the drama on that set three years ago.

“For someone like that, there’s like Olivia and four other people on the planet who could play that role. Thank god we went to her first, and she said yes,” he said, though Rogen didn’t comment on how any of Wilde’s version of herself in the show came from those rumors.

“For Parker [Finn], too, it was even more specific. We needed a horror director who was willing to act, who had directed a few horror movies that had a gimmick that was reputable and also applicable to other films,” Rogen said. “Parker, who did ‘Smile,’ there’s really maybe nobody else. Our backup was, like, ‘Would “M3GAN” work?'” Rogen said. “We brought it for Parker specifically, and he was willing to do it. We did not put ourselves in an easy position. Thank god a lot of these people panned out.”

As for another filmmaker Rogen would love to cameo in a potential future season, he said, “David Fincher. I think of people who have a very specific thing they’re associated with. Someone like Fincher would be funny. He’s doing 400,000 takes of an insert shot.”

One cameo viewers will see when the first two episodes drop March 26 is Sarah Polley directing Greta Lee in a one-take scene that Matt, simply by dropping in on set to observe, ends up totaling many times over.

Also lured by Rogen for a great inside joke of a cameo is film reporter, “The Town” podcaster, and Puck co-founder Matthew Belloni, previously at The Hollywood Reporter for 15 years. Matt regularly listens to “The Town” while cruising in his convertible on Sunset Blvd. (OK, the one thing this show gets wrong about the town in question is how empty of traffic Sunset Blvd. looks at any point!) But Belloni also shows up for a viciously embarrassing encounter with Bryan Cranston’s studio head later in the season, which we won’t spoil.

“I literally messaged [Belloni] on Instagram. It started as just the voice. I was like, ‘Your podcast is a very convenient expositional tool for us, and it would be great if you could record stuff,’ I believe his exact response was, ‘That’s funny: Expositional tool was my nickname in high school,'” Rogen said. “We then thought it would be funny to physically include him in the episodes and have him be this threat of if he finds out the shenanigans we are up to, the whole studio could come crashing down… It wasn’t that hard. Most people are happy to be included on the joke.”

“The Studio” premieres on Apple TV+ March 26. Stay tuned for more IndieWire coverage.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,Ted Sarandos Recalls Les Moonves Challenging if He Had Any Idea ‘How Television Works’,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/ted-sarandos-les-moonves-how-television-works-1235110726/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Netflix has now officially been in operation for over a quarter of a century and in that time have largely upended the traditional business models around film and television, for better and worse. Speaking in a recent interview with Variety, Ted Sarandos recalled the reception he received from longtime executives over choosing to release entire seasons of shows all at once, creating the binge model.

“I got a phone call from then CBS head Les Moonves,” said Sarandos, “who said, ‘Do you know how television works?’ He goes, ‘You give them one at a time, and you can drag it out over 13 weeks before you need to find something new.’”

Forced to resign from CBS over a number of sexual harassment allegations and denied his $120 million severance package, Moonves is largely in the rearview of the entertainment industry while Sarandos now continues to push it forward. Between him and Chairman of the Board Reed Hastings, they saw a vision for how the internet would alter viewing habits and stuck to their guns, even contributing to the downfall of the physical media business that started their company in order to stay ahead.

“When I first met Reed, he described Netflix almost exactly like it is right now,” Sarandos said to Variety. “He didn’t use the word ‘streaming.’ He called it ‘downloading videos’ then, but he was very clear that he thought all entertainment would come into the home on the internet. And this was at a time when no entertainment came into the home that way.”

In terms of the creative side of the business, it turns out there were lessons to be learned from Moonves as Sarandos’ initial prestige goals for the studio’s output would have to be adapted as Netflix started to understand what their audience was interested in watching.

“Ted really kept us focused on HBO as the target,” said Hastings. “He wanted us to see ourselves as a content network rather than an Amazon-like retailer. Later, he came to regret that slightly, because he said it should have been HBO and CBS. Because we didn’t want it to be just elite programming, we wanted it to be mainstream as well.”",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,‘Saw XI’ Taken Off 2025 Release Calendar,https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/saw-xi-removed-release-calendar-1236346843/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 21:06:06 GMT","Jigsaw won’t be returning to theaters in 2025 after all.

“Saw XI” has been axed from the release calendar. Lionsgate’s gory slasher, the 11th installment in the long-running franchise, was scheduled to open on Sept. 26, 2025. The studio will instead release another blood-soaked horror film, “The Strangers – Chapter 2,” on the newly freed date.

It’s not clear if Lionsgate has plans to unveil “Saw XI” at any point. The studio greenlit the sequel in 2023 with franchise veteran Kevin Greutert on board to direct. Yet the film’s screenwriters Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan recently told the Hollywood Reporter that “zero progress” had been made since they turned in a draft in the spring of 2024.

Billy the Puppet, the ventriloquist dummy used by John “Jigsaw” Kramer in “Saw,” is apparently well versed in these reports, which he dismisses as idle chatter. The spooky doll promises he’ll eventually return to theaters.

Popular on Variety

“I’ve seen the rumors. They say it’s Game Over,” Billy the Puppet said in a statement released by Lionsgate. “You all should know me better than that. The game is never over.”

Billy the Puppet is probably right, because “Saw” has remained a big screen draw for two decades with $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales across 10 films. Most recently, “Saw X” hit theaters in 2023 and slashed its way to $112 million globally. Anchoring the series is the terrifying serial killer named Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), who puts his victims through deadly games that test their wills to live.

“The Strangers: Chapter 1” opened in theaters last summer and generated $48 million, a better-than-expected sum since the horror film was panned by critics and audiences. Lionsgate intends to turn “The Strangers” into a standalone trilogy — separate from the studio’s 2008 Liv Tyler-led thriller of the same name — with Chapter 3 to follow. The first installment centers on a young couple (Madelaine Petsch and Froy Gutierrez), who are forced to spend the night in a remote cabin after their car breaks down in an eerie small town. No surprise, they are terrorized by masked intruders with seemingly no mercy or motive.

“I promise that we’re making ‘The Strangers—Chapter 2’ as terrifying as possible,” Petsch said. “I can’t wait to show you on Sept. 26.”

Producers Mark Canton and Courtney Solomon added, “Like ‘Strangers’ fans everywhere, we’re thrilled for ‘Chapter 2’ — it’s the kind of film that’ll have audiences watching through their fingers. Bringing it to theaters this Halloween season is perfect, and we can’t wait for everyone to see where the story goes next.”",indiewire

Saw XI which had the date has been moved off the calendar for the time being.

The first movie, Strangers: Chapter One, debuted last May, and was one of the better performing movies for Lionsgate, making $35.2M domestic, $48.1M worldwide.

Renny Harlin directs Riverdale‘s Madelaine Petsch as well as Gabriel Basso and Ema Horvath. Producers are Courtney Solomon, Mark Canton, Christopher Milburn, Gary Raskin, Alastair Burlingham, Charlie Dombek on the horror franchise movie. Alan R. Cohen & Alan Freedland wrote the screenplay.

The Strangers movie franchise kicked off in 2008 at Focus Features and starred Liv Tyler in the Bryan Bertino directed and written movie. That pic followed James Hoyt and Kristen McKay who visit an isolated vacation home only to encounter a rude surprise when three masked assailants make their stay a nightmare. The movie was massive on a $9M production cost grossing $52.5M stateside, and over $82M WW.

Watch on Deadline

Ten years later, there was a sequel, The Strangers: Prey at Night which Johannes Roberts directed off a script by Bertino and Ben Ketai. The pic, released by the now dead Aviron Pictures, made $24.5M domestic, $31M WW.

Strangers – Chapter 1‘s blurb was as follows: After their car breaks down in an eerie small town, a young couple is forced to spend the night in a remote cabin. Panic ensues as they are terrorized by three masked strangers who strike with no mercy and seemingly no motive.

Per THR, Lionsgate and the producers of the Saw franchise aren’t on the same page in regards to the project, hence the pic getting kicked off the calendar prior to CinemaCon. Saw XI‘s scribes Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan turned in a draft a year ago, which they’ve billed as being timely.

Dani is expected to wind up as Scola’s new partner, with Alabi possibly being promoted from recurring to series regular for Season 8.

FBI this season had been trying to permanently fill the void left by Katherine Renee Kane, whose Special Agent Tiffany Wallace left the team in the Season 7 premiere.

At first, Special Agent Stuart Scola (John Boyd) in Episode 2 was assigned a temporary partner who elected not to stick around, sensing she had huge shoes to fill.

In Episode 4, Lisette Olivera (National Treasure: Edge of History) began an arc as Syd Ortiz, a Behavioral Analysis Unit agent who was rotated onto Jubal’s (Jeremy Sisto) team. But in late October, ahead of Olivera’s on-screen debut, it was reported the actress would be departing the series after filming only a handful of episodes.

Alabi makes her debut in the Tuesday, April 1 episode, titled “Covered.” When an undercover FBI agent is killed in the field, the team makes the unnerving discovery that the identities of multiple UCs have been compromised — including Maggie, who has been working to infiltrate an eco-terrorist group. The team in turn enlists the help of an agent (Alabi) whose cover was blown, to not only save one of their own but to aid in uncovering who was behind the leak.

Alabi already has some experience in the world of CBS procedurals: She played firefighter Mahina, who became a love interest for T.C., on Magnum P.I., and plays war correspondent Olivia Navarro on S.W.A.T. (She guest-starred in an episode of FBI: International as well.) Her other TV credits include NCIS, Teen Wolf, The Rookie and Jane the Virgin.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,Robinhood Faces Bay State Probe Over Sports Futures Contracts,https://www.sportico.com/business/sports-betting/2025/robinhood-sports-massachusetts-probe-subpoena-1234844470/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 19:15:45 GMT","Massachusetts subpoenaed financial technology company Robinhood last week seeking information about its new sports event futures trading product available in all 50 states. It relaunched following behind-the-scenes communication with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

While the federal CFTC is the de facto overseer of futures trading for now, states are now taking a close look at whether platforms such as the one from Robinhood violate state betting laws. Nevada recently sent Kalshi, the exchange that powers Robinhood’s sports event futures, a cease-and-desist letter.

As Sportico has reported, industry insiders widely view state actions as a greater threat to the burgeoning futures industry than the CFTC.

Reuters was the first to report the Massachusetts subpoena, with Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth Bill Galvin saying that the sports futures trading product “is just another gimmick from a company that’s very good at gimmicks to lure investors away from sound investing.”

Galvin’s office confirmed the reporting in an emailed statement but declined to provide further comment about whether it would probe platforms in addition to Robinhood.

Robinhood denied wrongdoing. “The event contracts offered by Robinhood Derivatives are regulated by the CFTC and offered through CFTC-registered entities,” wrote a company official in an email. “Prediction markets have become increasingly relevant for retail and institutional investors alike, and we’re proud to be one of the first platforms to offer these products to retail customers in a safe and regulated manner.”

The subpoena reportedly asks for copies of Robinhood marketing materials and information about who in the state has engaged in March Madness futures trading through the firm.

Robinhood (HOOD) stock has risen rapidly since it announced it would resume offering sports-related contracts ahead of March Madness. It closed up 9% for the day at $48.36 per share on Monday, and has increased from $36.02 on March 13.

In an April 2025 cover story for Vogue France, Ceretti, 26, was briefly asked about her connection to DiCaprio, 50, who the outlet referred to as a “very, very famous actor.” The model revealed — in French — that she met the Oscar winner in Milan but didn’t want to go “into details.”

“As soon as you’re in a relationship with someone who has a larger following than you, you become ‘girlfriend of’—or ‘boyfriend of,’ for that matter. And that can be extremely annoying,” Ceretti said when asked of her thoughts on being labeled as the significant other to another star. “Suddenly, people are talking about you as so-and-so’s girlfriend who was so-and-so’s ex. So it’s not nice to think that you can’t love whoever you want, because of the labels people need to stick on you.”

Ceretti added that dating an A-Lister has become a learning experience especially when one person is one of the most popular stars.

“Who hasn’t seen it? Or didn’t like it?” she teased. “It’s an iconic film…”

DiCaprio and Ceretti have been linked since summer 2023. The pair were first spotted together multiple times around the world in August 2023 including a coffee and ice cream date in California and partying at a club in Ibiza, Spain. Months later, Us Weekly confirmed that DiCaprio and Ceretti were “exclusive.”

“Vittoria is all he thinks about,” the insider exclusively told Us in November 2023, noting that the actor is “completely smitten” with Ceretti.

That same month, Ceretti was spotted at DiCaprio’s star-studded birthday bash. People reported at the time that the couple were “affectionate and kissing throughout the night.”

“I don’t think it’s gonna be that hard a job,” Lithgow, 79, revealed on the Monday, March 24, episode of the “Smartless” podcast.

The two-time Academy Award nominee confirmed in February that he was joining HBO’s Wizarding World series, based on J.K. Rowling’s fantasy novels, as Hogwarts’ most powerful sorcerer.

Lithgow explained to “Smartless” hosts Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett that his “deal” to join the Harry Potter show was finalized only “48 hours” before his interview on the podcast.

“In airports, two weeks ago, people had somehow gotten wind of this and they were stopping me in airports,” he explained.

Joking that he was “behind everybody” with his Potter reading, the actor said he was just “halfway through” the second book, 1998’s Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

“The overall concept of this overall reboot of Harry Potter is that an entire season is devoted to a single novel,” he said.

Lithgow admitted it was so early in the Harry Potter development process that he “honestly [didn’t] know” all of the details about how much time he’d spend in the U.K. filming the show.

Comparing Harry Potter to his time playing late British Prime Minister Winston Churchill on The Crown, Lithow said, “I mean, I was over in England for eight months for The Crown and barely came back [to the U.S.]. I think I may have come back once or twice. I imagine that I can come back much more [on this].”

[…]

“You know, Dumbledore is — he’s kind of the nuclear weapon. He only goes on very, very occasionally,” he added. “And I think that — I don’t think it’s gonna be that hard a job, and we’ll just go back and forth.”

Lithgow previously admitted to ScreenRant in February the offer to play Dumbledore came as “a total surprise.”

“I just got the phone call up at the Sundance Film Festival for yet another film, and it was not an easy decision because it’s going to define me for the last chapter of my life, I’m afraid,” he said.

“Some wonderful people are turning their attention back to Harry Potter. That’s why it’s been such a hard decision,” he added. “I’ll be about 87 years old at the wrap party, but I’ve said yes.”

Dumbledore was originally played by Richard Harris in 2001’s Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone and 2002’s Chamber of Secrets, before he died in October 2002 following a battle with Hodgkin lymphoma.

Michael Gambon took over as the Hogwarts professor following Harris’s death, making his debut in 2004’s Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and staying on for six films, in total. Toby Regbo played a younger version of the character for flashback scenes in both Deathly Hallows movies, while Jude Law portrayed a middle-aged Dumbledore in the Fantastic Beasts movies.

Lithgow, whose acting career dates back to 1972, received Oscar nominations for 1982’s The World According to Garp and 1983’s Terms of Endearment, and won three Emmy Awards for his leading role as bumbling alien invader Dick Solomon in NBC sitcom 3rd Rock from the Sun (He won three more Emmys in his career).

“I tried going on Summer House for a moment,” Porter, 27, revealed on the March 5 episode of her “Don’t Be Ridiculous” podcast when discussing the Bravo show. “Maybe I’ll try again.”

According to the former MTV reality star, she has met cast member Ciara Miller “a couple of times” and loves Paige DeSorbo.

“Speaking of Paige, you know Paige and Hannah [Berner]?” she asked her cohost Sebastian Genta. “I am so incredibly proud of them. They were at the Vanity Fair Oscars red carpet. … They’re the nicest girls. They’re so funny and I’m just really proud of their success. They deserve it. They’re f—ing crushing it right now.”

From 2017 to early 2023, Porter starred on Siesta Key alongside Kelsey Owens, Madisson Hausburg and other cast members.

The MTV reality show followed a group of friends in the Florida city as they navigated friendships, relationships and plenty of surprises.

“The reason I think the show ended is I do think a lot of things had changed,” Porter explained. “These are my friends from high school through early, early 20s. I don’t really talk to them anymore. It’s a different era. Things were dying. I was ready to grow. I knew I was going to stay in Miami. They didn’t necessarily belong in Miami.”

While the show’s fifth and final season was filmed in Miami, Porter claimed that there was a possibility that a new spinoff could be created focused on her life away from the States.

What Is the Best Reality Franchise of All Time?

Porter said a film crew based out of London filmed her in Paris for three days, and the initial reaction from producers was positive.

“It was honestly magical. It was such a spinoff moment,” she said. “They tried to pitch it to MTV. They got my friend Serena Kerrigan. Amanda [Marie Miller] was going to come. … At the last minute, they spun and moved to Miami because it was too expensive.”

“I think a lot of networks try to just redo the same thing that they know has worked, which makes sense from a budget standpoint,” she said. “But it’s redundant.”

In her new book I Am Maria — a collection of poems and reflections by the author — Shriver, 69, revealed she was unable to get off the floor of her hotel room after learning of her husband Arnold Schwarzenegger’s infidelity. The news came soon after the deaths of both of her parents.

“I was consumed with grief and wracked with confusion, anger, fear, sadness, and anxiety. I was unsure now of who I was, where I belonged. Honestly, it was brutal, and I was terrified,” Shriver wrote in an excerpt published by People on Monday, March 24.

“As I sat on my hotel room floor in the dark, alone with tears streaming down my face, I thought to myself: Maria, this doesn’t have to be the end of you,” she added.’

After welcoming four children together, the pair announced their split in May 2011 amid reports of infidelity. (Schwarzenegger […]

But Shriver found a way to persevere. The pair were married for 25 years before Shriver learned of Schwarzenegger’s transgression and filed for divorce in 2011.

Shriver writes that she won’t “bore” readers with “the details of my self-pity party” or the trips to “various therapists, healers, shamans, and psychics” but she does tell one story.

“I even went across the country to a cloistered convent,” Shriver writes. “At the end of my stay there, Mother Dolores took me aside, and in what once again felt like a scene right out of The Sound of Music, said to me, ‘Maria. I understand that you like it here very much. But if you’re thinking you can come live with us, let me tell you, you can’t. Our cut-off age is fifty, and you’re fifty-five!’”

“She said, ‘I think what you’re really looking for, my child, is permission to leave your marriage, to be Maria.’ She hugged me, and then we both wept,” Shriver added.

“I’ve made lots of mistakes. One of them was tying my self-worth to my achievements,” she writes in the book. “Another big mistake was thinking that someone outside of me could guarantee my safety, my worth, and my peace.”

Shriver and Schwarzenegger, 77, finalized their divorce in December 2021.

In the excerpt, Shriver concluded by writing, “I’ve also had to come face to face with other misguided beliefs — about aging, about being alone. I used to believe that if you didn’t have a partner, you must be unworthy and unlovable. I’ve learned that nothing could be further from the truth.”

Kyle Richards, Sofia Richie-Grainge, Kourtney Kardashian, and Hailey Bieber have all been known to use it.

Shields’ pick is crafted with zinc oxide that immediately blends into the skin without leaving a pesky white cast behind. In addition to shielding the skin against harmful UV rays, it also helps reduce the appearance of blemishes and discoloration. Its formula is the secret to its results — it’s packed with 5% niacinamide, which reduces acne and other imperfections. Over 36,000 shoppers even report that their signs of aging look less noticeable!

This dermatologist-loved SPF is a bestseller on Amazon, boasting over 36,000 five-star ratings. It’s so good that over 70,000 shoppers have purchased it in the past month.

“I’ve been using EltaMD Sunscreen for years now and just keep ordering it!” one happy shopper wrote. “It’s my absolute favorite! It’s lightweight, non-greasy and absorbs quickly without leaving a white cast, which is a huge plus for my sensitive skin. I love that it provides broad-spectrum protection and is gentle enough for everyday use, even on my face.”

“It’s been a year since I started using this sunscreen, and I have to say, it’s the only one that hasn’t caused me breakouts,” another shared. “I have oily skin, so I’m prone to breakouts if a product is too oily. This sunscreen is super lightweight and absorbs into the skin easily. I highly recommend it for oily skin!”

When Brooke Shields swears by a skincare product, we can’t help but scoop it up fast. Head to Amazon to get glowing, sun-protected skin this spring!

https://usmagazine.com,Meghan Markle Launches a Site Where You Can Shop Her Closet,https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/meghan-markle-launches-a-site-where-you-can-shop-her-closet/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 20:38:28 GMT","Run, don’t walk, to discover Meghan Markle’s new website where you can shop a “handpicked and curated collection of things [she] loves,” as announced via Instagram on Monday, March 24.

The Duchess of Sussex’s new venture came at the request of her fans: “Many of you have asked, so here you go!” she wrote on her Story with a video of her scrolling through the website. “A little shopping to start the week. More to come.” She included a link and labeled it “Shop My Closet” in all caps.

The personalized ShopMy storefront features 30 pieces, all rendered in her usual neutral color palette. Wardrobe staples include apparel and accessories that can be mixed, matched and pared back for endless outfit combinations, which, like Markle, 43, you will wear on repeat.

Better yet, there are also pieces inspired by her high-low approach to dressing, including several key styles from her Netflix series, With Love, Meghan.

Related: We've Already Watched Meghan Markle's Netflix Show: Everything We Learned The time has come to journey to Montecito. After much anticipation, speculation and fleeting sneak peeks, Meghan Markle‘s With Love, Meghan, drops on Netflix on Tuesday, March 4, at 3 a.m. ET — but before that, Us Weekly nabbed and watched advance screeners of all eight episodes. Here’s everything we learned from binging the Duchess […]

Along with the many affordable options available, fans of her show will recognize the $52 button-down chambray shirt and $128 cashmere shell, both from J.Crew. The same goes for what was perhaps the most-talked-about luxury item of all six episodes: that $1,415 Lora Piana knit (seen on episode two, when Mindy Kaling compliments her “lewk”), which instantly sold out but is (yes!) now available via Markle’s ShopMy site.

While the $109 Zara linen pants she paired the top with are still out of stock, Markle smartly sourced a near-identical, less-expensive alternative pair at J.Crew for $82. Ditto for the $295 Jenni Kayne sweater she layered overtop — only this time, it’s a solid shade called “oatmeal” versus the original, which was “oatmeal-striped.”

You’ll also find a $99 trench coat from Uniqlo that looks far more expensive than it is. The outerwear is classic Meghan Markle, as she memorably made similarly tailored beige cotton trench coats her trademark during the earliest days of her courtship with Prince Harry.

We saw her pack a Burberry version for the 2018 Australian royal tour, and before that, she even sported a trenchcoat silhouette in dress-from, like the sleeveless look from the Canadian label Nonie that she chose to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Nelson Mandela’s birth in 2018.

The look was a re-wear from Markle’s closet; she purchased the trench dress from the Calgary-based brand while living in Toronto before she moved to London in the fall of 2017. Consider it the latest proof that Markle is a master at creating a capsule wardrobe, filled with timeless essentials that you can wear again (and again) for years without going out of style.

Related: Why Meghan Markle’s High-Low Style in New Show Deserves a Second Look Meghan Markle‘s very-talked-about new Netflix series With Love, Meghan (which is officially getting a second season, as announced on Friday, March 7), isn’t just a cooking show; it’s a window into her “high-low” signature style, a blend of accessible and luxury brands that defines her post-royal wardrobe. In episode two, featuring Mindy Kaling, this philosophy […]

There are also affordable, of-the-moment matching sets, like the Gap black ribbed crewneck ($71) and coordinating sweater pants ($63) — a comfy-chic combination that has continued to trend and, thanks in no small part to Markle’s endorsement, shows no sign of slowing down.

Indeed, Markle’s ShopMy site feels as personal as it does polished, and her signature fashion sense is reflected in every item, if not because it’s what we know to be her taste but also because she’s worn near-identical pieces on numerous, very public occasions since day one.

At Us, we’re partial to “The Boyfriend” linen shirt ($190) by WNU and the Ray-Ban “Aviator Classic” sunglasses that are in the mix. They instantly recalled the ’fit that Markle memorably sported during her first public appearance with Prince Harry at the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto.

Naturally, the moment dominated headlines and, therefore, feels nostalgic in the hearts of many royal fashion watchers — and perhaps also for Markle, considering the items clearly refer to the look that hard-launched her relationship with her now-husband and father of her two children Archie, 5, and Lilibet, 3.

The rest is history — and all the pieces on her site deserve a place in your own sartorial future.

Chu has set the record straight on casting rumors for his Britney Spears biopic.

“[We] have not had one conversation about casting this movie yet,” Chu, 45, confirmed Sunday, March 23 via X.

The Wicked director responded to speculation that Ariana Grande, Sabrina Carpenter and Millie Bobby Brown were all in the running to play the “Gimme More” singer, 43. Wicked fans were especially excited about the prospect of Grande potentially reuniting with Chu following their award-winning success with the musical, in which she costarred as Glinda.

However, the filmmaker shot down the rumors entirely by writing on X, “None of this is true. Sounds exciting but have not had one conversation about casting this movie yet. We are way too early in development. Sorry.”

Related: 'A Cinderella Story' Almost Starred Another Iconic Pop Star — Not Hilary Duff While it’s hard to imagine anyone but Hilary Duff starring in A Cinderella Story 20 years after its release, another pop princess was initially eyed for the movie’s lead role. “I distinctly remember I was on a train, and I had the cover of Rolling Stone magazine that Britney Spears did — the first one […]

Deadline reported in August 2024 that Chu was teaming up with Universal Pictures on a film adaptation of Spears’ 2023 New York Times bestselling memoir The Woman in Me. The memoir detailed Spears’ years-long battle to be freed from a conservatorship that controlled her life, both personally and professionally.

Several notable stars have expressed interest in playing Spears, including Brown, 21, revealing on The Drew Barrymore Show in 2022 (long before the memoir’s publication) that she felt passionate about the “Toxic” singer’s life story.

“I want to play a real person and I think for me, Britney. [It] would be Britney Spears,” Brown told host Drew Barrymore. “I think her story resonates with me. Just growing up, watching her videos, watching interviews of her when she was younger — I see the scramble for words and I don’t know her, but when I look up pictures of her I feel like I could tell her story in the right way and hers only.”

Spears seemed less than enthusiastic about Brown’s movie pitch, suggesting on Instagram at the time that it was premature to turn her life into a Hollywood film.

Related: Who’s Who in the ‘Wicked’ Movies: A Comprehensive Guide to the Characters Wicked has long been one of Broadway’s most profitable productions — and Jon M. Chu is ready to bring the bewitching story to the big screen. The musical, which was inspired by Gregory Maguire’s 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, tells the story of the Wicked Witch of the […]

“Good news, good news !!! Still breathing … I hear about people wanting to do movies about my life … dude I’m not dead !!!” Spears wrote via Instagram in November 2022. “Although it’s pretty f—king clear they preferred me dead 🙄🙄🙄 … I guess my family is going to lock their doors now 🤔🤔🤔🙄🙄🙄🤧🤧🤧 !!!”

American Horror Story star Emma Roberts was later recommended by Spears’ former assistant, Felicia Culotta, as ideal casting for the movie.

“I was like, ‘I love her assistant,’” Roberts, 34, later joked to Cosmopolitan in August 2024. “I mean, it’s my true dream to play Britney Spears. It’s a rumor, but I hope maybe it’ll come true.

“I mean, I remember I locked myself in my room and listened to In the Zone and said, “I cannot leave this room until I memorize every word,” the AHS actress recalled.

The biopic’s director, Chu, has plenty of experience tackling music-themed projects, as he made Justin Bieber’s concert movies Never Say Never and Believe, in 2011 and 2013, respectively. He later directed the film version of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Broadway breakthrough In the Heights in 2021 and received acclaim for 2024’s Wicked.

A Wicked sequel, titled Wicked: For Good, will hit cinemas in November 2025. Based off the second act of the hit Oz-inspired Broadway show of the same name, Chu’s musical reunites him with Grande and Cynthia Erivo, who return as Glinda and Elphaba.

Related: Ariana Grande Calls Using Full Last Name in 'Wicked' Credits a 'Homecoming' Ariana Grande is paying homage to her younger self in the upcoming film Wicked. Early screenings of the new musical, which hits theaters on November 22, have revealed that the pop star, 31, is listed in the film’s credits by her full name, Ariana Grande-Butera. During a recent interview with Australian reporter Justin Hill, Grande […]

In January 2025, Chu warned Spears superfans that it would be “a long road” before the biopic was completed because he wanted to ensure authenticity and sensitivity.

“I’m a big fan of Britney. I’ve been a fan since I was young and she was young and she was one of 12 acts at the Shrine Auditorium,” he told Entertainment Tonight. “So I want to do her justice and tell her story right.”

Meanwhile, it was reported in February that Britney agreed to cover her father Jamie Spears’ outstanding legal bills resulting from the conservatorship, totalling over $2.12 million. The pair also agreed that Britney’s payments resolved any lingering disputes with her father, relating to the termination of her conservatorship in 2021.",usmagazine

“We were out, we don’t go out a lot but we were out in the streets last night because we saw the most amazing show on Broadway,” Shepherd, 57, said on the Monday, March 24, episode of her eponymous talk show. “Last night, we went to the opening of Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal’s show Othello.”

Shepherd and her cohost Jawn Murray were invited to the show by pals Kandi Burruss and her husband Todd Tucker, who served as producers for the play. Othello’s opening night brought out a lot of big names including Jennifer Lopez, Angela Bassett, Samuel L. Jackson, former President Joe Biden and more.

While Shepherd was enjoying a nice night out at the theatre, the talk show host claimed she was approached by an “unnamed celebrity” and the pair had a tense exchange.

“Let me tell y’all something, I get along with everybody. I really do,” she said. “So I’m standing there talking to [Ellis’ wife] Khadeen [Joseph] and [former football player] Devale Ellis and Devale Ellis’ sister. So this unnamed celebrity actress — who shall remain nameless — I’m standing there talking [and] somebody grabbed my arms and they forcefully turned me around.”

Shepherd continued: “So I’m in a good mood so I go ‘Hi what’s going on? Cause I know her and she says to me, ‘You’ve been shading me a lot.’”

Shepherd shared that was “really confused” by where this thought came from. The talk show host denied shading the anonymous person who allegedly walked away in the middle of the confrontation.

“First of all, I know who I shade because I don’t shade many people. It might be one person I shade and I have never shaded this unnamed celebrity,” she said on Monday. “She came up to me in front of everybody going ‘You shaded me’ and then she [walked] off.”

After the exchange, Shepherd shared that she was “really mad” and wanted to continue the conversation.

“I went to the bathroom during intermission and I stood there for 15 minutes waiting for a meeting in the ladies’ room,” she shared. “You don’t get to pull me and turn me around like we’re in a dag on cartoon and then walk away.”

While Shepherd waited, she says the unnamed celebrity never appeared at the restroom. So Shepherd decided to address the situation publicly on her show.

What Is Your Favorite Daytime Talk Show?

“So I would say to [the] unnamed celebrity because you think I shaded you, which means you watch my show, I don’t know who you think I am,” she said to the camera. “I think you get me confused with somebody like the bloggers or influencers ’cause I know I didn’t shade you. Matter of fact when something scandalous did come up about you, I was on your side when it happened.”

Shepherd did not reveal the name of the person but alleged that they have “known each other for a long time.” She subsequently invited the star to appear on the talk show so they could talk out the issue.

“Come sit on my couch so we can talk about it,” she quipped. “And you know who you are.”

Murray, who witnessed the incident, shared that he had never seen Shepherd so mad before. He joked that the situation could have turned into a “Broadway battle.”

“I ain’t never seen you ready to fight before,” he confessed. “I was like, ‘Who is this woman? She’s ready to fight.’”

Shepherd explained that while she’s a “sweet” and “praying person” she’s not to be messed with because she grew up in Chicago. Murray gave another hint to the mystery star’s identity as he quipped that the person might also be from “Chicago too.”

“I love it, two Chicago broads,” she said. “We definitely got to talk.”",usmagazine

Miller died on Friday, March 21, while the family was vacationing at a resort in Costa Rica, according to a Monday, March 24 report by Inside Edition. The news was reportedly confirmed by the U.S. Embassy of Costa Rica.

News of Miller’s death was announced in a statement by Brett, 41, and his wife, Jessica, released by the Yankees on Sunday, March 23.

“With heavy hearts we are saddened to announce the passing of our youngest son, Miller,” the statement read. “He was 14 years old and has left us far too soon after falling ill along with several other family members while on vacation. We have so many questions and so few answers at this point, but we do know that he passed away peacefully in his sleep on the morning of Friday, March 21st.”

No cause of death for Miller has been announced.

The Yankees organization also released their own statement on Sunday after Miller’s death was revealed, which read in part, “Our love for the Gardner family is unconditional and absolute, and we will offer our enduring support while understanding their desire for privacy at this time. May Miller rest in peace.”

Yankees general manager Aaron Boone addressed Miller’s death with reporters at the team’s spring training facilities in Tampa, Florida, on Sunday.

“We talk about being family all the time, and even though Brett’s been gone for a few years, that doesn’t stop,” Boone, 52, said, per the New York Post. “A lot of people in [the clubhouse] know that family intimately. It’s a very tough day and very tough news.”

Boone added, “As best we can, we’ll be praying for the Gardner family and where we can, offering support. That’s kind of the unimaginable that unfortunately that’s where we are with it. Very sad. Very tough.”

Brett’s final four seasons with the Yankees came with Boone as the team’s manager, who took over duties in 2018.

New York Mets manager Carlos Mendoza also addressed Miller’s death during his media availability on Sunday.

Mendoza and Brett, 41, played together in the Yankees’ minor league organization from 2006 to 2007, and Mendoza later managed Brett during Mendoza’s time as bench coach for the Yankees. Mendoza was hired as Mets manager in November 2023.

“So happy for you both ! 🥰🥰,” Ivanka, 43, commented on Woods’ Instagram post on Sunday, March 23.

Woods, 49, went public with his and Vanessa’s relationship on Sunday, sharing a snap of the pair smiling as they stood side by side. In another image, Vanessa, 47, placed her head and arm on Woods’ chest while laying together. Vanessa reshared the upload via her Instagram Story.

“Love is in the air and life is better with you by my side! We look forward to our journey through life together,” Woods captioned the post. “At this time we would appreciate privacy for all those close to our hearts.”

Woods and Vanessa’s relationship began to make headlines earlier this month when the Daily Mail claimed that the pair had been together since Thanksgiving 2024. According to the outlet, the couple’s children attend the same school. (Woods shares daughter Sam, 17, and son Charlie, 16, with ex-wife Elin Nordegren, while Vanessa is mom to Kai, 17, Donald III, 16, Tristan, 13, Spencer, 12, and Chloe, 10, with ex-husband Donald Trump Jr.)

Us Weekly reached out to both Woods and Vanessa’s teams for comment at the time.

Vanessa previously wed Donald Jr., now 47, in 2005. After 12 years of marriage, Vanessa filed for divorce in March 2018. Following their split, a source exclusively told Us that Vanessa and Donald Jr.’s relationship became rocky amid President Donald Trump’s first election campaign.

The professional golfer, 49, has been “quietly dating” Vanessa, 47, for “several months,” People reported on Thursday, March 13. The Daily Mail, which was first to report the news, claimed Woods and Vanessa have been together since Thanksgiving 2024. The […]

“Vanessa is very close to her family and very private and does not like all this attention on her family,” the insider shared at the time. “They’ve been unhappy for a while.”

Woods, for his part, is no stranger to a public relationship. In 2009, news broke that Woods was unfaithful to Nordegren. The exes divorced in 2010, and he sought treatment for sex addiction amid the scandal. Woods moved on with alpine skier Lindsey Vonn, dating her for nearly three years before calling it quits in 2015.

Woods later dated Erica Herman for five years. In 2023, news broke that Herman filed a lawsuit against the golfer to nullify a non-disclosure agreement she signed at the start of their romance. She also claimed he sexually harassed her while she was working at his Florida restaurant. Herman dropped the NDA appeal and sexual assault allegations in November 2023.",usmagazine

Pascal, 49, and Aniston, 56, left the Tower Bar at the Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood on Saturday, March 22.

Pascal donned a black leather jacket with jeans and suede boots while Aniston rocked a white T-shirt with a black vest, pairing the look with blue jeans and black high-heel boots.

In a photo obtained by Us Weekly, Pascal and Aniston were seen chatting with friends outside the valet.

One year before their outing, Pascal and Aniston made headlines when they did a joint interview with her The Morning Show costar Reese Witherspoon at the 2024 Critics Choice Awards red carpet.

“He’s got the chicest arm sling I’ve ever seen,” Aniston said of Pascal’s injury. “It’s the softest thing I’ve ever felt.” (Pascal shared at the 2024 Golden Globes that he “fell.”)

Pascal interjected that he didn’t want to talk about his injury, but he instead wanted to discuss the The Morning Show. When asked what he wanted to speak about, he quipped, “I just want to stand next to it, I want to be near it, that’s it.”

Aniston and Witherspoon, 49, proceeded to ask Pascal whether he would be interested in a part on the series, which premiered in 2021.

“We actually do have a really good part for him,” Witherspoon said, to which Aniston gasped.

Pascal proceeded to exit the interview, kissing Aniston’s hand on the way out. “We hired him and then he just fired himself,” Aniston joked. “We love him.”

The Morning Show, which was renewed in 2023, has not yet released a date for the season 4 premiere. It was reported in June 2024 that Marion Cotillard would be joining the cast as Celine Dumont, a savvy operator from a storied European family.

Later that month, TVLine confirmed that the dad of Aniston’s Alex Levy would be added to the crew. While his casting wasn’t initially announced, the outlet reported in July 2024 that Jeremy Irons was cast. That same month, news broke that The Good Place’s William Jackson Harper was added as the Head of Sports at the network.",usmagazine

“He had reached out,” Lauren, 31, revealed during Us Weekly’s exclusive clip from this week’s episode of Amanda Hirsch’s “Not Skinny But Not Fat” podcast. “He was someone that I had connected with in the pods.” (Scott was not heavily featured on the show as he wasn’t part of the five couples who got engaged.)

At the time, Lauren said she wanted to “explore this connection” with Scott, 34, and he agreed. They “talked for a little bit,” before focusing on next steps.

“We explored it a little bit on our own first and then decided to bring it to [Dave],” she added. “It wasn’t the most fun thing to deal with in terms of, because he and Dave are friends.”

Scott reached out to Dave, 33, about his connection with Lauren, she explained. Dave initially said “all good” to Scott.

“I think there were some other comments to other people about how it might have been too soon for me,” she added. “We broke up six months ago and it’s not like you and I have been chatting or anything. I didn’t feel like there was anything wrong with that.”

Lauren also made it clear that things between her and Scott didn’t come out of the blue.

“When they bring people onto this, we take all of these compatibility tests with the goal being there are multiple people that you’re compatible with in the pods,” she explained. “It’s not like you just show up and there’s one person that is there for you, and hopefully you find them.”

Lauren and Dave got engaged during Love Is Blind season 8, which premiered on Netflix last month. After they met in person, their relationship started to fracture. Dave took issue with Lauren’s fling from before the show, while Lauren was upset that Dave wouldn’t introduce her to his family. They ultimately broke up before walking down the aisle.

Lauren spoke with Us Weekly exclusively about splitting from Dave, saying there was “definitely an element of sadness” when they broke things off.

“I do feel like you see the moment that I shift — when he starts to get mad at me and mad at my family,” she explained. “The anger that came from him, I was done. I immediately knew we’re never getting past this. My husband would not speak to me like this. I hope that that comes across clear.”

Happy spring! If passing this milestone has you panicking about your seasonal wardrobe — or lack thereof — we’re here to help. You might not need any new jeans or dresses, but investing in a few new tops is an easy way to spice things up.

Certain cuts, shapes, silhouettes and prints are more flattering than others. In times like these, we turn to some of our favorite celebrity moms for ideas.

https://usmagazine.com,JonasCon 2025 Recap: What It Was Really Like to Attend,https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jonascon-2025-recap-what-it-was-really-like-to-attend/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 18:36:23 GMT","JonasCon wasn’t your ordinary day at the mall.

Among the casual mallgoers who were making returns or trying to get a photo with the Easter Bunny on Sunday, March 23, thousands of Jonas Brothers fans infiltrated American Dream mall in East Rutherford, New Jersey for the first-ever JonasCon, a (mostly) free fan convention in honor of the band’s 20th anniversary. And while American Dream is already a unique experience — the shopping center across from MetLife Stadium has an indoor theme park, water park and ski slope — it was hard to prepare for what happened when the main attractions became Jonas-fied.

Us Weekly was in attendance on Sunday, chatting with fans (mostly millennial women in groups of two to four, completely decked out in Jonas Brothers gear) who were on a high after getting a glimpse of Nick, Joe or Kevin Jonas — or even their former security guard, Big Rob, who is featured on their 2008 song “Burning Up.”

“We saw Big Rob when we were in the merch store. It was crazy,” a 32-year-old fan from New Jersey named Briana told Us. Another New Jersey local, Maya, 28, gushed, “Big Rob came up to the VIP section and gave everybody fist bumps.” (More on that VIP section in a minute.)

Related: Next Gen! Jonas Brothers’ Kids: A Guide to Kevin, Joe and Nick’s Children Back in the early aughts, the Jonas Brothers exploded on the scene with their infectious pop hits. Since then, members Kevin Jonas, Joe Jonas and Nick Jonas have grown up and started their own families. Before the band of brothers was created, they were an ordinary family living in New Jersey. Parents Kevin Sr. and […]

Throughout the all-day affair, Nick, Joe and Kevin performed six different times across three different stages. There were two “Jonas Beach” sessions — where fans changed into bathing suits and sang along in a wave pool (despite what you may be thinking, the beach was the most-talked about highlight for many fans) — and three “Sky Stage” sessions, which turned the ice skating rink into a stage. (If you’re wondering if we witnessed fans leaving the pool area dripping wet to continue their day at the mall, the answer is yes. However, most fans who went in the water changed in a locker room. We had to inquire!)

Those five performances were ticketed events, which fans had to register to attend. There was a free general admissions option and a VIP package for $200.

NJ fans Maya, Alexis, 28, Sam, 29, were VIPs at the Sky Stage and weren’t thrilled that their wristbands got them access to the second and third floor views, with no food or drink options. (The GA section was the floor whereas VIPs were promised “optimal views.”)

“I got up at 4:30 this morning [to get here],” Maya said, clarifying that she’s “not mad” at Nick, Joe or Kevin, but VIP Nation will be hearing from her about the seating arrangements. (In the company’s defense, the website does appear to say that the “optimal views” are on the third floor.)

Despite the minor complaints, the three women made it clear to Us that attending the event was worth it.

As did the 30+ fans who spoke to Us. Many attendees traveled specially for the Con, with a 32-year-old fan from Costa Rica telling Us she paid $1,200 on flights and a hotel. She camped out by the third stage, which hosted a completely free (no registration required) concert. “I cried and everything,” she told Us.

Another fan from Colorado cried when talking to Us about being there.

“I’ve been a fan for 19 years and it’s just my entire world,” Ashley, 31, said as fans screamed Camp Rock karaoke at the bar we were sitting in. “You grew up with them, I’ve been with them my entire life. ”

Ashley’s highlight was also the free show. To completely paint the picture, the third stage was located right in between a Mrs. Fields, which was selling JonasCon cookies for a cool $6 with tax, and a Wetzel’s Pretzels. The crowd was a mix of those aforementioned millennial fans and random people at the mall who wanted to know why a crowd was forming.

When the Jonas Brothers surprised the mixed group by bringing fellow boy band Big Time Rush on stage, one fan yelled, “This is the best day ever!” At the exact same time, an older woman turned to the person next to her to ask, “Who is this?” (Being unaware of the Nickelodeon boy band didn’t stop her from recording the entire thing, BTW.) During their entire 20-minute surprise set, the mall was literally shaking as people jumped up and down and screamed at the top of their lungs.

The stars of Swift’s “Bejeweled” music video — Este Haim, Danielle Haim, Alana Haim and Laura Dern — were among thousands of fans in attendance at the tour’s opening night in Glendale, Arizona’s […]

Outside of the performances, there were several activations set up throughout the mall. Some were already established American Dream activities that were tweaked to be Jonas Brothers-themed like the Jonas Brothers escape room, GI Jonas laser tag and Jonas mini golf.

Others were pop-ups specifically for JonasCon, like a “listening room” for Joe’s new music where fans waited in a line to go into a room to hear about five minutes of Joe’s new music and get specific merch for the middle sibling. Us met a group of women who waited in line three times to hear clips from Joe’s upcoming album. “You have to come listen to it,” they urged as they prepared for another 30-40 minute wait.

The lines were a pretty consistent theme throughout the day, but Jonas Brothers fans are a specific breed who … don’t care?

“The expectation was that we were gonna wait a long time. It’s not as hectic as I thought it would be,” one fan told Us. “There’s a lot to do for free. Our merch line was only an hour. We were prepared for three hours.”

Speaking of merch, fans could buy T-shirts, hats, beach towels, tote bags, stickers and basically anything else they could want Nick, Joe or Kevin’s face at several locations throughout the mall/Con, including some fan vendors who applied and were chosen by the Jonas Brothers’ team to sell their product. (Us met one creator from Utah who is such a big fan that she named her 4-year-old son Jonas.) There was, however, one giant merch store that consistently had a line that was 45+ minutes, with fans telling Us that they spent anywhere from $50 to $300 inside. The top selling item was a Teddy Bear sweater that said, “This is my JonasCon sweater” — one woman even bought one in a “youth” size despite being 28 years old because she had to have it.

There were $18 milkshakes named after Jonas Brothers songs, a JonasCon Museum with past costumes, records and a drum set and a constant stream of Jonas Brothers music blasting throughout the mall. Some fans indulged in all of it, and others walked around looking for Franklin Jonas or the three Camp Rock cast members (Meaghan Martin, Roshon Fegan and Anna Maria Perez de Tagle) in attendance for a selfie. Vanderpump Rules’ Scheana Shay also made an appearance to reprise her role as the “Pizza Girl” in a 2009 Jonas music video.

Before the night was over, the Jonas Brothers announced three albums. Joe’s solo project, Music for People Who Believe in Love, (the one aforementioned fans couldn’t get enough of) will be out May 2, a Jonas Brothers live album will drop June 13 and a new album, Greetings From Your Hometown, is expected August 8, just two days before they are back in East Rutherford to play MetLife Stadium. (Speaking of, how could we forget Eli Manning’s cameo to induct the boys into the NJ Hall of Fame? It’s almost like the former New York Giants quarterback lives in that complex.)

The brothers also announced a new song called “I Can’t Lose” will be part of Sunday Night Baseball on ESPN and another song titled “Celebrate Happy” will serve as the soundtrack of Disneyland‘s 70th anniversary. While joking Camp Rock 3 was coming, they did confirm the name of their Disney+ holiday movie (naturally called A Very Jonas Christmas) and teased International JonasCon dates to be announced.

All in all, the Jonas Brothers fans seemed to be satisfied and not eager to forget the experience, which was confirmed when Us witnessed several fans ripping the posters and signs off the walls of the mall to take them home. If only the mall employees thought to take them down themselves — they might’ve made a killing selling them at JonasCon 2026.",usmagazine

At this time, Mr. Morrison and legal counsel are working diligently to ensure that the facts of the case are fully understood and appropriately addressed.""

The attorney says Morrison is fully cooperating with authorities, and is confident that the investigation will clear up the situation and vindicate him from any wrongdoing. For now, Morrison is asking the public to withhold judgment until all the facts are presented.

""Return of the Mack"" singer Mark Morrison got busted on a battery charge in Florida ... after allegedly striking the general manager of a swanky restaurant.

According to the police report, obtained by TMZ, Morrison stormed into Le Bar à Vin in Palm Beach on Saturday evening ... and started yelling and cursing at the venue's general manager. It seems Morrison was upset over an event he started planning with the venue on Friday.

Cops say witnesses told officers the situation escalated to the point Morrison allegedly pushed the manager in his upper body. Nicola Lavacca, the manager, did not fight back.

The report says a witness jumped in, separating the two and asked Morrison to step outside. Based on the evidence, cops arrested Morrison on a charge of simple battery.
