 Ethereum's market cap surpasses global giants like Toyota and Disney, highlighting its value despite trading 57% below its 2021 all-time high. 

Ether is trading at around half its all-time high price, but the Ethereum network is still valued higher than some of the world's most prominent companies. 

Ether (ETH) traded at roughly $2,088 at the time of writing amid continued exchange-traded fund (ETF) outflows, down over 57% from its all-time high of nearly $4,900 set in mid-November 2021, according to CoinMarketCap data. 

Despite this decline, Ethereum maintains a market capitalization of nearly $252 billion, surpassing global corporations such as Toyota ($250 billion) and the total market value of the precious metal platinum ($245 billion).

Other notable companies currently worth less than the Ethereum network include IBM, McDonald's, General Electric, Shell and Disney. If Ethereum were a company, it would be the fiftieth largest in the world, just behind Nestlé, with its market capitalization of nearly $256 billion.

Alex Obchakevich, founder of Obchakevich Research, told Cointelegraph that speculative interest significantly contributes to Ethereum's valuation, as well as its “freedom from the financial framework of traditional finance.” He added:

Flavio Bianchi, a Polkadot ambassador and the chief marketing officer of the decentralized fundraising platform Polimec, told Cointelegraph that the comparison is less insightful than it might appear at first. He highlighted that “Ethereum isn't a business” — it's infrastructure. He explained:

Obchakevich also suggested Ethereum became more attractive after it transitioned to proof-of-stake (PoS), reinforcing “its value as a deflationary asset with growth potential in the digital economy.”

Recent data from Ultra Sound Money shows that Ethereum is inflationary again, with an annual inflation rate of about 0.73% over the past 30 days.

The rate of inflation or deflation is largely dependent on the ETH fees burned by the network and the amount of newly issued Ether. Fees have been burned on the network since the implementation of EIP-1559 in 2021, which, paired with decreased issuance after the PoS transition, resulted in Ethereum being deflationary during sustained network activity.

IntoTheBlock data shows that on March 23, daily fees on Ethereum fell to a little over $337,000, the lowest value reported since June 2020. YCharts also shows that on March 23, there was only 118.67 ETH worth of fees, the lowest value reported this year.

Over the past 24 hours, ETH's value rose nearly 3.5%, increasing its market capitalization by about $9.3 billion, now totaling approximately $252.1 billion. For comparison, this figure exceeds Greece's gross domestic product (GDP), currently around $243.5 billion.

Obchakevich highlighted that other than being worth more than Greece's GDP, Ethereum's market cap is also higher than the GDP of countries such as Slovenia and Croatia combined. He said this is more than a curious factoid:

Pradeep Singh, CEO of enterprise privacy and security infrastructure firm Gateway FM, told Cointelegraph that these numbers reflect “a fundamental shift in how we value digital infrastructure”:

The Ethereum protocol continues to evolve as developers introduce innovations such as native rollups, further expanding the blockchain's capabilities and potential use cases.

Bitcoin traders are reacting positively to the United States (US) Federal Reserve's (Fed) policy shift. As BTC hovers around the $88,000 level on Monday, analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin price gains this week. Technical analysis supports Bitcoin's bullish thesis. 

With $5.8 trillion assets under management, Fidelity filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a US Treasury Fund, ‘OnChain', to be rolled out on the Ethereum blockchain., This product could hit the market as early as May 30, 2025 if approved. 

Trump-backed World Liberty Financial spent $3 million on MNT token purchase. The move follows a major network upgrade in the project. 

Bitcoin's bullish outlook is currently supported by the improvement in trader sentiment, technical analysis and the Federal Reserve's move towards quantitative easing. As traders turn bullish on the token, BTC hovers close to $88,000 and eyes a re-test of resistance at $90,000. 

Bitcoin price is 3% away from the resistance at the time of writing. Both key momentum indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) support the likelihood of BTC price gains. 

The RSI is sloping upwards and reads 51, which is above neutral. MACD flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line, showing an underlying positive momentum in the  Bitcoin price trend.





BTC/USDT price chart 

Bitcoin sentiment tracker shows that traders remain fearful, but less so relative to last week. The sentiment is improving according to the Fear & Greed Index. This is also supported by a nearly 9% increase in the Open Interest (OI) in Bitcoin derivatives in the last 24 hours. 

Bitcoin could test resistance at $90,000, and a daily candlestick close above this level could pave the way for a return to the $100,000 milestone in the coming weeks. 

Fidelity remains optimistic about the Ethereum blockchain and plans to bring its US Dollar-backed Treasury Fund on-chain as early as May 30, 2025, if the SEC allows it. The $5.8 trillion asset manager eyes better transparency and efficiency by leveraging Ethereum's blockchain infrastructure and does not involve tokenizing US Treasury securities. 

Fidelity's plan signals another positive step in Real-world Asset Tokenization (RWA), following in the footsteps of BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. With a fund backed 99.5% by US Treasury and cash, secured on the Ethereum blockchain, it could set a precedent for tokenized treasuries or the secondary market. 

Investors with a blockchain wallet could benefit from the transparency, which could drive higher adoption among web3 and crypto-first users. 

SEC nod could allow Fidelity to move the plan forward to make RWA a relevant narrative in crypto. Traders can expect more asset management giants to follow Fidelity in the coming months, and the narrative and RWA tokens could gain relevance. 

Donald Trump backed WLF's $3 million MNT token purchase is making headlines. The project completed a major network upgrade and is now on the radar of crypto traders and large wallet holders, as WLF adds $3 million worth of the token to its portfolio, tracked by on-chain firms like Arkham Intel. 

The Mantle Network is preparing for Ethereum's Pectra upgrade as part of the process the project integrated EigenDA last week to enhance scalability and ensure better compatibility. 

WLF's MNT purchase increases holdings to over $340 million; these include Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Tron (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), AAVE, Ethena (ENA), among others. 

MNT gained 6.37% on Monday, as traders react to the upgrade and WLF's purchase. The token is up nearly 4% in the last seven days and bullish technical indicators on the daily price chart support further gains in MNT this week.

Bitcoin traders are reacting positively to the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) policy shift. As BTC hovers around the $88,000 level on Monday, analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin price gains this week. Technical analysis supports Bitcoin's bullish thesis. 

Dogecoin open interest plunged to a near four-month low in mid-March before beginning a slow recovery. Mr. Fei Chen, founder and CEO of Intellectia AI, shared his thoughts on Dogecoin, a potential DOGE ETF, and the likelihood of DOGE inclusion in a US Strategic Crypto Reserve in an interview. 

Bitcoin price extends its gains and trade above $87,400 at the time of writing on Monday after recovering 4.25% last week. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicts that BTC could hit $110,000 before retracing to $76,500, supported by the US Fed's dovish stance on inflation and US President Donald Trump's flexibility on tariffs.

Solana's price extends its gains on Monday after recovering 5.32% last week. Reports suggest that the White House is narrowing its approach to tariffs set to take effect on April 2, likely omitting a set of industry-specific tariffs.

Bitcoin price stabilizes around $84,000 at the time of writing on Friday after recovering nearly 2% so far this week. The recent announcement by the US SEC that Proof-of-Work mining rewards are not securities could boost BTC investors' confidence.

According to Michaël van de Poppe, the likelihood of Bitcoin and Ethereum trending upwards is higher due to diminished panic over tariffs, no interest rate hike from Japan, and a significant downward movement in the US Dollar. These conditions are favorable for cryptocurrency price increases, which traders should consider for their strategies.

 Digital asset investment products record weekly net inflows for the first time in five weeks, but Ethereum-based ETPs have $86 million in outflows. 

XRP and Solana led all altcoin-based exchange-traded product (ETP) inflows during the week ending March 21, with $6.71 million and $6.44 million respectively, according to digital asset investment firm CoinShares.

Other altcoin inflows were comparatively modest, with Polygon (MATIC) logging $400,000 and Chainlink (LINK) adding $200,000.

Sentiment toward altcoins remained mixed overall, as Ether (ETH) alone saw significant outflows totaling $86 million. Other notable outflows included Sui (SUI), with $1.3 million, Polkadot (DOT), with $1.3 million and Tron (TRX) with $950,000.

Despite Ether's substantial outflows dragging down the altcoin sector, digital assets collectively reversed a five-week streak of net outflows, registering inflows of $644 million. Bitcoin (BTC) led this recovery with inflows amounting to $724 million, snapping its own five-week negative streak.

As Cointelegraph reported, Ethereum has now experienced net weekly outflows for four consecutive weeks, while Bitcoin recorded its largest net inflow since January.

CoinShares noted that the majority of inflows originated from the US, which accounted for $632 million, driven primarily by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). 

Positive sentiment, however, extended beyond the US, with Switzerland leading other regions at $15.9 million, followed closely by Germany ($13.9 million) and Hong Kong ($1.2 million).

Although altcoins collectively suffered a net outflow driven primarily by Ethereum's performance, Solana and XRP emerged as the standout altcoin performers. 

In Solana's case, the US market is poised to introduce its first Solana futures exchange-traded funds (ETF), potentially paving the way for a future spot Solana ETF.

In Bitcoin's case, the approval of futures-based ETFs was initially favored by regulators due to the existence of a regulated market (the Chicago Mercantile Exchange), which provided assurances against potential market manipulation. However, this raised controversy over the SEC's continued rejection of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which directly hold the cryptocurrency. 

A pivotal lawsuit by Grayscale successfully challenged this inconsistency, compelling the SEC to revisit its stance and ultimately paving the way for approval of the long-awaited spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Meanwhile, XRP has seen a significant boost from the recent dismissal by the SEC of its long-running lawsuit against Ripple Labs.

MicroStrategy's Bitcoin stash reaches milestones, now over 2.55% of BTC's circulating supply.

Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has expanded its Bitcoin holdings past 500,000 BTC following its latest acquisition.

In a March 24 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company disclosed the purchase of 6,911 BTC for approximately $584.1 million, or an average of $84,529 per BTC.

The new addition brings MicroStrategy's total stash to 506,137 BTC. The company has now spent approximately $33.7 billion on its Bitcoin investments, with an average cost of $66,608 per coin. Given current market prices, the firm holds an unrealized profit estimated at over $10 billion.

This milestone strengthens MicroStrategy's role as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin by a wide margin. Its holdings now represent approximately 2.55% of the 19.8 million BTC currently in circulation.

Moreover, the scale of MicroStrategy's Bitcoin exposure is even more striking when compared to other major holders.

The firm owns Bitcoin equal to nearly half the amount held by all 12 US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which cumulatively hold around 1.1 million BTC.

It also holds Bitcoin equivalent to nearly half the amount believed to be owned by Bitcoin's mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, whose estimated stash is also 1.1 million BTC.

Metaplanet has acquired more than 1,000 Bitcoin this month.

Japan-based Bitcoin investment firm Metaplanet has reported a record-breaking daily trading volume of ¥50.4 billion (around $337 million) following its latest BTC acquisition.

The surge places the company 13th among Japanese firms in terms of trading activity, outpacing automotive giant Toyota, which has the country's highest market capitalization.

Metaplanet CEO Michael Gerovich confirmed the milestone on social media platform X while stating that the unprecedented trading volume reflects rising investor confidence.

As a result, investor sentiment remains strong for Metaplanet's stock, which has climbed more than 7% in the past day and over 41% since the start of the year. According to Google Finance data, the stock trades at ¥5,060 (approximately $33) as of press time.

Meanwhile, the record-breaking activity came on the same day as Metaplanet's general shareholders meeting, which saw around 1,500 attendees.

Gerovich used the event to reiterate the firm's commitment to Bitcoin, saying:

“MetaPlanet will continue to move forward as a Bitcoin pioneer in Japan. The future is Bitcoin. We are just getting started.”

Metaplanet's trading activity spike comes as the firm ramps up its monthly Bitcoin purchases.

According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, Metaplanet has acquired 1,115 BTC through five separate transactions this month.

On March 3, it picked up 156 BTC, followed by 497 BTC on March 5. A week later, it bought 162 BTC. On both March 18 and March 24, Metaplanet added another 150 BTC each time—spending $12.6 million on each of the latter purchases.

These acquisitions bring its total holdings to 3,350 BTC, valued at current prices at roughly $291 million.

The aggressive buying reflects Metaplanet's long-term Bitcoin strategy, which aims to position itself as a key player in the digital asset space.

However, the firm is drawing global attention for its BTC holdings and recent high-profile moves.

One notable development is the addition of Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, to its strategic advisory board. His involvement is expected to elevate Metaplanet's profile as it scales its influence beyond Japan and into the United States.

Analysis Is the US retreating from its hardline stance on crypto? On Friday, the US Treasury Department lifted sanctions imposed on notorious crypto mixer Tornado Cash, once accused of washing billions in illicit crypto for criminals and nation-states alike.

In 2022, the Biden administration alleged that Tornado Cash had laundered upwards of $7 billion in virtual currency since 2019, including $455 million stolen by North Korea's Lazarus Group, leading to sanctions that prohibited its use. In 2023, US prosecutors indicted two of the founders of Tornado Cash, alleging the service facilitated more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds.

However, following a federals appeal court ruling in November which questioned the Treasury's authority to ban the crypto mixer's smart contracts as they were not the "property" of any foreign national, the sanctions have now been lifted, though authorities continue to express concerns about the platform's misuse.

"We remain deeply concerned about the significant state-sponsored hacking and money laundering campaign aimed at stealing, acquiring, and deploying digital assets for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Kim regime," the department said in a statement.

"Treasury remains committed to using our authorities to expose and disrupt the ability of malicious cyber actors to profit from their criminal activities through the exploitation of digital assets and the digital assets ecosystem. Treasury will continue to monitor closely any transactions that may benefit malicious cyber actors or the DPRK, and US persons should exercise caution before engaging in transactions that present such risks."

Cryptocurrency mixers are services that blend multiple users' cryptocurrencies to obscure transaction origins and destinations, enhancing privacy but also potentially facilitating money laundering.

Tornado Cash, launched in 2019 as an open-source Ethereum mixer, was intended to improve transaction privacy but was also exploited by malicious actors for illicit purposes.

One of the software's developers – Alexey Pertsev – was arrested by Dutch authorities in 2022 and convicted on money laundering charges in 2024, receiving a sentence of 64 months. He is currently appealing that verdict.

In August 2023, US authorities indicted Tornado Cash co-founders Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on charges including conspiracy to commit money laundering and sanctions violations. Storm was arrested and is fighting his case, while Semenov has eluded the authorities and is on the FBI's wanted list, for now.

The Treasury's decision to lift sanctions on Tornado Cash aligns with a broader shift in the current administration's approach to digital currency regulation.

Also on March 21, the Securities and Exchange Commission's Crypto Task Force held a public roundtable to discuss how existing securities laws apply to digital assets, and to consider the development of a new regulatory framework tailored to these technologies.

The meeting follows a busy week on the cryptocurrency front from the SEC. On March 19, the SEC dropped its appeal in a five-year legal case against XRP token supplier Ripple Labs, and two of its senior executives - cofounder Christian Larsen and CEO Bradley Garlinghouse.

"This is it – the moment we've been waiting for. The SEC will drop its appeal – a resounding victory for Ripple, for crypto, every way you look at it," said Garlinghouse on X. "The future is bright. Let's build."

About two weeks earlier, Garlinghouse met with President Trump to discuss the future of cryptocurrency and its regulation. He also reportedly donated $5 million to Trump's inaugural committee.

In the 2020 case, the SEC alleged that Ripple Labs raised approximately $1.3 billion through unregistered sales of XRP, violating federal securities laws. In July 2023, a court ruled that XRP sales on public exchanges did not qualify as securities transactions, though Ripple's direct sales to institutional investors did meet the criteria. The SEC initially appealed the decision, but withdrew its appeal mid-last week, leading to a more than 10 percent surge in XRP's price.

The SEC subsequently clarified that because proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining activities do not involve the offer or sale of securities, they fall outside the agency's regulatory remit.

"It is the Division's view that 'Mining Activities' in connection with Protocol Mining, under the circumstances described in this statement, do not involve the offer and sale of securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934," it said.

"Accordingly, it is the Division's view that participants in Mining Activities do not need to register transactions with the Commission under the Securities Act or fall within one of the Securities Act's exemptions from registration in connection with these Mining Activities."

The issue of cryptocurrency hasn't just been on the regulatory agenda, politicians are taking a closer look as well.

Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of senators updated pending legislation dubbed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which was passed by the US Senate Banking Committee.

The GENIUS Act was introduced in February and is designed to clarify the law in relation to stablecoins - digital currency that is tied to a traditional asset, like the US dollar. It would ensure that stablecoin suppliers obey anti-money laundering rules, ensure digital cash is tied to a real asset, and mandate regular audits and public disclosures to ensure transparency and consumer protection.

"The updated version of the GENIUS ACT makes significant improvements to a number of important provisions, including consumer protections, authorized stablecoin issuers, risk mitigation, state pathways, insolvency, transparency, and more," said co-sponsor Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY).

Gillibrand is not the only Democratic politician to support the legislation, and it's likely that it will need to hit the 60-vote threshold to pass into law with cross-party support. However, the ranking member of the committee, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), was not pleased with the result.

"The bill ignores basic consumer protections that apply to every other financial product available in America. If you're sending a US dollar from your PayPal wallet, and you get scammed, the CFPB has the authority, right now, to help you get your money back. But if this bill passes, and you're sending a stablecoin from your PayPal wallet and you get scammed, you may be out of luck," she opined.

"In fact, the bill even invites scammers into the market by refusing to prohibit people convicted of fraud and money laundering from owning stablecoin companies. Sam Bankman-Fried could buy a stablecoin company from prison and regulators would have no legal grounds to stop him under this bill."

While the House of Representatives has yet to take up the bill, strong bipartisan support for stablecoin regulation suggests it could receive a favorable reception once introduced. ®

Financial markets gave risk-on vibes early Monday during Asia hours based on reports that the next round of Trump tariffs due on April 2 could be more measured than initially expected.

Bitcoin (BTC), the largest digital asset by market value, traded at around $86,500, up 2.7% on a 24-hour basis, with Solana's SOL token trading nearly 6% higher at $138, according to CoinDesk data. 

Payments-focused XRP was up 2.5% at $2.44, trading above its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) after two consecutive weeks of positive price action.

Futures tied to the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq rose over 0.5% on the day, while Wall Street's fear gauge, the VIX index, slipped 2.5% to 18.88 points. Markets in China reversed early losses.

The sentiment improved as media reports over the weekend said President Donald Trump's planned "reciprocal tariffs" expected April 2 could be more focused than the barrage occasionally threatened. 

Some countries will be exempt, and existing levies on steel and other metals may not be cumulative, Bloomberg's report said.

Trump's tariffs roiled the market sentiment in February, sending both stocks and the crypto market lower. BTC fell nearly 17.6%, hitting lows under $80,000. Last week, the Federal Reserve revised its inflation forecasts higher while downgrading growth figures likely due to Trump's aggressive trade policies.

The Fed, however, called the tariffs-led inflationary impulse transitory while retaining forecasts for two rate cuts this year in a dovish move for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

The Fed action, coupled with prospects of easing tariffs, has revived bullish sentiment in the market. 

"I bet $BTC hits $110k before it retests $76.5k. Y? The Fed is going from QT to QE for treasuries. And tariffs don't matter cause “transitory inflation”. JAYPOW told me so," BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who is now chief investment officer at Maelstrom, said on X. 

The other key factors to watch out for in the coming days are Friday's PCE reading, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, and the appearance of the SEC nominee Paul Atkins and Comptroller of the Currency nominee Jonathan Gould before the Senate Banking Committee on March 27.

Bitcoin (BTC) hovers around $85,600 on Monday after recovering 4.25% last week. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) also followed in BTC's footsteps, hovering around their key levels after recovering almost 7% each the previous week. 

Bitcoin price broke and closed above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at around $85,502 last week but failed to find support around it. Moreover, it broke and closed above its 200-day EMA again on Sunday. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers around $85,600.

If BTC finds support around its 200-day EMA, it could extend the recovery to retest its key psychological level of $90,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 48, pointing upward toward its neutral level of 50, indicating fading bearish momentum. The RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator showed a bullish crossover on the daily chart last week, giving a buy signal and suggesting a bullish trend ahead. Additionally, it shows rising green histogram levels above its neutral level of zero, indicating strength in upward momentum.





BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if BTC fails to find support around its 200-day EMA and closes below $85,000, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $78,258.

Ethereum price was retested, and support was found around its daily level of $1,861 for the last two weeks, and it recovered nearly 7% last week. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers around $1,980.

If the daily support around $1,861 holds, the ETH price could extend the recovery to retest its March 7 high of $2,258.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 40, approaching its neutral level of 50, indicating fading bearish momentum. However, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained. The MACD indicator showed a bullish crossover on the daily chart last week, giving a buy signal and suggesting a bullish trend ahead. Additionally, it shows rising green histogram levels above its neutral level of zero, indicating strength in upward momentum.



ETH/USDT daily chart

However, if ETH breaks and closes below the daily support at $1,861, it could extend the decline to retest the next support level at $1,700.

Ripple price broke above its 100-day EMA at $2.31 last week and recovered almost 7%. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers around $2.42.

If the 100-day EMA around $2.42 continues to hold, it could extend the recovery to retest its next resistance level at $2.72.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 51, hovering around the neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among the traders. The RSI must point upward and move above its neutral level of 50 to sustain the bullish momentum. The MACD indicator showed a bullish crossover on the daily chart last week, giving a buy signal and suggesting a bullish trend ahead.



XRP/USDT daily chart

However, if XRP fails to find support around its 100-day EMA and closes below, it could extend an additional decline to test its next support level at $1.96.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Bitcoin traders are reacting positively to the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) policy shift. As BTC hovers around the $88,000 level on Monday, analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin price gains this week. Technical analysis supports Bitcoin's bullish thesis. 

Dogecoin open interest plunged to a near four-month low in mid-March before beginning a slow recovery. Mr. Fei Chen, founder and CEO of Intellectia AI, shared his thoughts on Dogecoin, a potential DOGE ETF, and the likelihood of DOGE inclusion in a US Strategic Crypto Reserve in an interview. 

Bitcoin price extends its gains and trade above $87,400 at the time of writing on Monday after recovering 4.25% last week. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicts that BTC could hit $110,000 before retracing to $76,500, supported by the US Fed's dovish stance on inflation and US President Donald Trump's flexibility on tariffs.

Solana's price extends its gains on Monday after recovering 5.32% last week. Reports suggest that the White House is narrowing its approach to tariffs set to take effect on April 2, likely omitting a set of industry-specific tariffs.

Bitcoin price stabilizes around $84,000 at the time of writing on Friday after recovering nearly 2% so far this week. The recent announcement by the US SEC that Proof-of-Work mining rewards are not securities could boost BTC investors' confidence.
