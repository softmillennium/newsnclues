<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://es.cryptobriefing.com/stablecoin-usd1-respaldado-por-trump-lanzamiento/'>World Liberty Financial Backed by Trump Stablecoin Test of USD1 in BNB Chain</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cryptobriefing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 18:20:35 <p>
World Liberty Financial (WLFI), backed by President Trump, has launched a stablecoin called USD1 on the BNB Chain.

The project team was prioritizing security and reliability guarantees before launching the market, according to Decrypt.

In a statement after token sales, Zak Folkman, co-founder of WLFI, said that these sales were only the initial steps.

Folkman shared a conversation with Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, which will be some "really big announcements" in the coming weeks.

The project has formed alliances with blockchain protocols, including Chainlink and AAVE, to improve their defi offers and use decentralized oracle services.


In terms of what they are building, WLFI is working on three main products: two that are already ready and prepared to launch, and a third which was not disclosed. Folkman revealed that the other two were a loan and loan market driven by intelligent contracts and a protocol focused on real world assets (RWA).


World Liberty Financial will manage its loan market through its own governance process, unlike traditional defi loan platforms which depend on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). This allows the company to maintain control and adapt the platform to meet the specific needs of its users.


The company intends to address a challenge faced by tradfi institutions: integrating tokenized assets into the defi ecosystem without problems. WLFI will offer access to products such as monetary market accounts, commercial real estate, debt and values, which are currently not available in the Defi space.

Folkman stated that World Liberty Financial is well positioned to serve as a bridge between tradfi and defi institutions due to its American corporation status with completely Kyc’d principles.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

President Donald Trump's decentralized finance project World Liberty Financial has launched its own stablecoin on both Ethereum and Binance's BNB Chain, according to on-chain data.

The launch of the token, called USD1, marks the culmination of a plan that has been in the works for some months.

With Trump back in the White House, and congressional Republicans racing to get a bill legalizing stablecoins over the finish line, it appears the World Liberty team feels the time is right for the president himself to enter the increasingly crowded—and lucrative—stablecoin market.

Stablecoins, which are generally pegged to the price of the U.S. dollar, serve as key on- and off-ramps between crypto and traditional financial markets.

They allow users to park on-chain funds in currencies that remain fixed in value even when crypto markets fluctuate.

Tether, the world's largest stablecoin issuer, posted a $13 billion profit last year, mainly from reinvesting customer deposits in yield-bearing U.S. Treasuries.

The legality of stablecoins in the U.S., however, also remains an open question.

World Liberty's USD1 stablecoin is currently compatible for trading on Ethereum and on BNB. 

On Monday, Binance's founder and former CEO, Changpeng Zhao celebrated the news, posting a welcome message to World Liberty on X.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bitcoin has again appeared at the centre of market speculation as it sees a potential recovery toward $90,000.

The latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is the main catalyst driving BTC’s recent prediction.

Historically, Bitcoin responds positively to signs of monetary policy easing.

As inflation cools and economic conditions stabilize, investors are increasingly bullish on Bitcoin’s trajectory.

Bitcoin's rally fuels optimism across the broader crypto market, with BinoFi's 1700% surge signaling broader market optimism.

FOMC’s Impact on Bitcoin: What the Latest Fed Decision Means for Crypto

The Federal Reserve prepares to announce its latest stance on interest rates, with investors watching for any dovish signals from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

Historically, Bitcoin has reacted strongly to changes in the Fed's policy outlook, with lower interest rates typically fueling a rally in risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

A more accommodative stance could propel Bitcoin past its 200-day moving average of $87,990.

This move will set the stage for a push toward the key $90,000 level.

On-chain data indicates that institutional demand remains strong, with major investors accumulating BTC ahead of the decision.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The crypto market is shifting fast, with major developments reshaping the landscape.

The XRP price surge has caught the market's attention, climbing 7% to $2.25 and sparking speculation about whether it can break the $3 barrier. After rebounding from the $2.10 support level, XRP is showing strength, with analysts closely watching resistance at $2.40 and $2.60.

Ethereum ETFs are gaining traction, with staking emerging as a key catalyst for ETH's next rally. Recent reports suggest that Ethereum's staking system could have a bigger impact on its price than the upcoming Pectra upgrade. Staking is becoming a major factor in Ethereum's value growth, potentially surpassing past technological improvements.

BlockDAG's presale momentum has garnered over $205.5 million, selling more than 18.8 billion BDAG coins, making it one of the most successful presales in the industry. The project is quickly approaching its $600 million target and is now preparing for its Mainnet launch and 10 CEX listings this year.

BlockDAG's next phase is all about utility and expansion. The network's Mainnet launch is set for 2025, marking a critical moment where BDAG will transition from presale success to full-scale blockchain adoption. Meanwhile, 10 major upcoming centralized exchange (CEX) listings are lined up to expand liquidity and accessibility.

BlockDAG's strategic partnerships are further fueling its ecosystem and growing developer base. Through its collaboration with HackerEarth, BlockDAG is driving massive ecosystem expansion, with over 200 dApps currently in development.

With each batch, BDAG's price steadily climbs, reinforcing its trajectory toward the anticipated $1 valuation for 2025. As the presale nears its final phases, the available supply of BDAG coins is rapidly dwindling, making early entries increasingly scarce. Early BDAG adopters have already gained 2,380% ROI, while those joining the presale before Batch 27 sells out could see 3,932% ROI once the $1 price target is reached.

The XRP price surge has reignited debate over a potential push beyond $3, with resistance at $2.40 and $2.60 under scrutiny. At the same time, interest in Ethereum ETFs is rising as staking becomes a key driver of its price growth.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Cryptocurrency investment products recorded $644 million in inflows last week, reversing five consecutive weeks of shedding assets.

Inflows to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds largely led the shift, followed by flows to Solana, Polygon and Chainlink investment products.


Total assets under management for crypto investment products rose 6.3% from their low point on March 10.


Cryptocurrency funds have recorded massive outflows over the past few weeks due to geopolitical and economic uncertainties driving investors away from risk-on assets.

In the U.S., spot Bitcoin ETFs logged outflows totaling $5.4 billion over a period of five weeks ending on March 21—the longest streak of weekly outflows for the funds since they clinched approval to launch in January 2024.


However, investor sentiment rose last week as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell soothed jittery markets after the U.S. central bank kept interest rates unchanged.

Bitcoin ETFs attracted $724 million last week, largely driving the recovery.


Ethereum saw the heaviest loss in investments last week, logging $86 million in outflows.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

House of Doge, an entity formed to bolster Dogecoin adoption via corporate deals and collaborations, has set aside 10 million DOGE, around $1.83 million, as a reserve.

A new liquidity pool, the DOGE reserve will help facilitate transactions for global merchants.

The strategic reserve is meant to bridge the gap between transaction processing times and real-world usability, making Dogecoin more practical for everyday purchases.

House of Doge claims that blockchain transaction times have hindered digital assets from being commonplace in everyday payments.

The entity aims to install reward programs and merchant incentives for utilizing DOGE in payments.

Financial firms like Grayscale and Bitwise have helped level up Dogecoin's financial legitimacy by filing for ETFs for the meme coin.

Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has surpassed 500,000 Bitcoin in its holdings.

After acquiring 6,911 Bitcoin last week, the company now holds 506,137 Bitcoin valued at $44.2 billion.

The company purchased Bitcoin at an average price of $84,500 per coin, slightly higher than the $83,000 paid for a previous purchase.


Strategy said it sold nearly two million shares of its class A common stock, resulting in around $593 million in net proceeds.

The sale was linked to an at-the-market equity offering program that authorized Strategy to sell up to $21 billion in common shares.

On Monday, the firm stated it can still sell an additional $3.57 billion in Strategy's stock through the program.


Strategy had also raised $1.1 million by selling "perpetual strike preferred stock" called Strike (STRK).

Its stock price dipped to $311.36 when U.S. markets opened but quickly recovered and was trading up 7.2% on the day.

The price of STRK, which began trading on Jan. 31, had increased 1.1% to $86.50.

Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor hinted at the company's latest Bitcoin-buying spree on X (formerly known as Twitter) on Sunday.

The cryptocurrency market remains ever-changing, with new projects gaining traction while some established platforms face challenges. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues its rapid ascent, selling over 300 million tokens and drawing strong investor interest.

On the other hand, PancakeSwap (CAKE) has encountered a downturn, with its value slipping amid reduced trading activity.

Mutuum Finance has seen a surge in investor enthusiasm, with its presale surpassing 300 million tokens sold and total funds raised exceeding $4.1 million. At a current price of $0.02, the token is set for its next increase, further fueling demand. Each phase of the presale is selling out faster, prompting more investors to secure their holdings before the next price adjustment.

What sets Mutuum Finance apart from many presale projects is its real-world DeFi use case. Unlike speculative tokens that launch with hype but limited functionality, MUTM is backed by a structured lending and borrowing ecosystem. This ensures sustained demand for the token, with a tangible financial framework supporting its growth.

Enhancing its credibility, Mutuum Finance is also undergoing a security audit by CertiK. This will reinforce trust in the platform’s smart contract reliability, providing investors with added confidence in its security and transparency.

PancakeSwap (CAKE) has experienced a notable decline. Over the past 24 hours, CAKE’s price has dropped by more than 10%, accompanied by a nearly 25% decrease in trading volume. This suggests a shift in investor sentiment as liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) faces short-term pressure.

Despite being one of the largest DEX platforms, PancakeSwap is facing growing competition in the DeFi sector. With more advanced lending protocols like Mutuum Finance emerging, investors are increasingly looking for platforms that provide innovative yield-earning opportunities beyond traditional DEX swaps and staking rewards.

Mutuum Finance is designed to sustain consistent demand for its token through its dual lending model, featuring both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms. This allows users to earn passive income while also accessing liquidity without the need to sell their assets.

A key innovation within Mutuum Finance is its overcollateralized stablecoin, ensuring robust liquidity without requiring a dedicated asset pool. Users mint stablecoins by locking excess collateral, helping to maintain a stable supply and avoid sudden de-pegging issues.

The platform incorporates a buy-and-distribute mechanism to reinforce long-term token demand. A portion of protocol fees is allocated to repurchasing MUTM from the open market, effectively reducing selling pressure while distributing these tokens to mtTOKEN holders. This creates an ongoing demand cycle that rewards long-term investors and sustains ecosystem growth.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A Solana token called Morning Routine (ROUTINE) has gained popularity, reviving interest in meme coins.

Over the weekend, ROUTINE's market cap reached $19 million, leading some to believe the meme coin trenches are heating up again.

The token is a reference to an intense morning routine shared by fitness influencer Ashton Hall on social media.

Hall wakes up at 3:52 and undergoes a series of activities, including two ice water facials and watching videos about God.

The video went viral on X (formerly Twitter), becoming one of the most viewed posts with over 667 million views in four days.

Morning Routine was launched on Pump.fun on Friday, March 21, and surged to $19 million market cap by Sunday.

Since then, ROUTINE has retraced 57% but has since surged 87.8% to a $15 million market cap.

There is also a beta play on Saratoga Spring Water (SARAGOTA), which references the bottled water Hall drinks in the video.

The price action on ROUTINE and SARATOGA has breathed life into the meme coin trenches, which have seen months of negative price action.

More than 100 traders have profited over $10,000 on ROUTINE, according to DEX Screener.

Meme coins have started to recover as a sector, with major tokens like Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), SPX6900 (SPX), and Bonk (BONK) recovering 80%, 68%, and 23% respectively.

Shiba Inu Price Moves to $0.000014: SHIB Holders Turn Bullish

The Shiba Inu (SHIB) is eyeing a push toward $0.000014, but a 236 billion SHIB supply could determine its next major move. According to IntoTheBlock data, 236.46 billion SHIB are currently held at $0.000014 by 3,780 addresses.

On-chain data shows a similar accumulation of 548.64 trillion SHIB supply held by 162,610 addresses in the range of $0.000014 and $0.000019, with a breach hinting at major gains for the Shiba Inu price.

The current on-chain data shows that the Shiba Inu price has oscillated in a tight range between $0.00001227 and $0.000013 as traders await the market's next move.

These include the number of traders, with short-term traders often signaling new retail engagement.

While most memecoins still show a downward trend in this metric, a potential Shiba Inu price reversal could mark a key turning point for the altcoin.

Second are transaction volumes, which reflect usage growth, even if not necessarily driven by new users.

At the time of writing, SHIB was up 0.7% in the last 24 hours to $0.00001285 and up 6% weekly.

Memecoin investors are currently cautious amid the turbulent Shiba Inu price trend.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/democrats-propose-more-bad-bitcoin-and-crypto-regulation'>Democrats Propose More Bad Bitcoin And Crypto Regulation</a></h2><b>Source:</b> bitcoinmagazine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 13:32:06 <p>
On Friday, Maryland Delegate Adrian Boafo (D) and New York Assemblyman Clyde Vanel (D) sent a joint letter to Democratic Congressional leaders urging them to pass comprehensive crypto legislation at the federal level.

In the letter, the elected officials cited New York State as being a leader in crypto regulation and proposed that New York's BitLicense be used as a model for what federal crypto regulation should look like.

The letter's authors also noted that New York State has placed a two-year moratorium on proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining that uses fossil fuels.


New York State requires that all virtual currency businesses that operate in the state obtain a BitLicense. At face value, obtaining a license to operate a business seems harmless enough.

But once you learn that it takes months to years to complete all of the paperwork and to jump through all of the hoops required to obtain one and that it costs upward of $100,000 to go through this process.


Because of the BitLicense, New York State residents cannot use reputable platforms like Strike, River, Swan, and Kraken.

Nor can they use Lightning on CashApp or the fiat-to-bitcoin exchange on Fold. This is only to name a few of the Bitcoin/crypto products and services that we can't use because of red tape.


If we were to apply the BitLicense on a federal level, we would deeply stifle innovation and entrepreneurship, as not only would we greatly hinder the Bitcoin and crypto companies that have the money and resources to go through the process of obtaining a federal BitLicense.

A federal BitLicense would be a major hindrance to President Trump's accomplishing his goal of making the United States the Bitcoin superpower and the crypto capital of the world.


While I know that burning fossil fuels is detrimental to the environment, I'm also a proponent of people being gainfully employed and industries being able to flourish.

In upstate New York, there's been a notable lack of both since factories began closing down in the region after World War II.

What replaced gainful employment in factories are service-sector jobs that barely enable workers to make ends meet.


The urban blight in most cities in upstate New York is so palpable that it's nauseating. What we could do to revive upstate New York is invite the Bitcoin mining industry in.

Sure, Bitcoin mining companies might burn some fossil fuels to power their operations at first.

But as Bitcoin mining incentivizes renewable energy production, they could move away from fossil fuels as their source of energy.


If the likes of Assemblyman Vanel and New York State's governor, Kathy Hochul (D), are so against companies that burn fossil fuels then 1) Why haven't they put a moratorium on all companies in the state that use fossil fuels?

2) Why haven't they enacted laws that do things like stopping all New York residents from using cars that have internal combustion engines?


If we were to apply such a mining moratorium on a federal level, we'd not only put many Americans out of work.

Lava's lending model provides liquidity without forfeiting BTC, allowing users to spend dollars while retaining their original stash.

Guillaume discusses the tension between saving in Bitcoin and spending in dollars, reflecting a pivotal moment for BTC's evolution. 

Holding BTC maximizes its scarcity-driven potential—fueled by finite supply and growing adoption—while tax complexities and volatility discourage direct spending.

Tax conditions in many jurisdictions impose restrictive burdens on spending BTC. In the U.S., the IRS treats BTC as property, meaning each transaction triggers a taxable event.

A $1,000 BTC purchase spent at $10,000 would trigger a $2,800 tax liability (assuming a 28% effective rate), making dollar-based spending via stablecoins a more tax-efficient alternative.

Analysts suggest BTC could reach $200,000 or more by 2030 if current trends persist, driven by inflation hedging and a weakening fiat system. Spending BTC at current prices locks in value at a fraction of its potential.

A buy-back strategy offers a pragmatic solution to balance the desire to spend with BTC retention. After borrowing dollars against BTC via Lava's platform, users can spend these funds while committing to repurchase BTC at a later date when market conditions or personal finances allow.

The buy-back can be timed to capitalize on market dips or post-tax season liquidity, potentially at lower prices, enhancing overall holdings.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The cryptocurrency market is heating up as Solana (SOL) nears a major breakout, sparking discussions about its future.

With a price consolidation around the $125 mark, many are wondering if Solana will break its resistance levels and lead the next bull rally. However, amidst this excitement, a newcomer—Coldware (COLD)—is quietly building momentum, and investors are increasingly turning their attention to this Web3 powerhouse.

Unlike Solana, Coldware (COLD) is integrating blockchain technology with Internet of Things (IoT) solutions in a decentralized manner. This fusion of IoT and Web3 is what sets Coldware apart from existing Layer-1 competitors like Solana (SOL). While Solana has made strides in scalability, it has struggled to maintain a seamless, fault-tolerant infrastructure for high-demand, real-world applications.

Coldware (COLD) uses Layer-2 solutions, designed to offload transactional burdens from the main network, making Coldware capable of handling the heavy throughput demands of IoT applications. This architecture ensures that Coldware (COLD) maintains a high level of security, efficiency, and scalability that Solana (SOL) has yet to achieve consistently.

The Coldware (COLD) platform supports an advanced decentralized network for IoT, offering greater security, scalability, and cost efficiency compared to Solana’s approach. By utilizing a Layer-2 system for rapid transactions and reduced congestion, Coldware holds the potential to redefine the future of IoT-enabled Web3 technology.

Furthermore, Coldware (COLD) stands out because of its unique ability to handle a wider array of decentralized applications (dApps) and real-world use cases in industries beyond finance. While Solana (SOL) may excel in DeFi applications, Coldware (COLD) can scale efficiently across industries like smart homes, healthcare, and logistics.

Over the past week, Solana (SOL) has faced fluctuating market conditions. The $136 highs from early in the week gave way to a more stable range of around $125. Despite setbacks, the network has seen increased activity, and many are forecasting a breakout in the coming weeks. However, the network’s growing transaction volumes are beginning to hit its limits, leading to delays and frustrations that continue to plague the network’s scalability.

In light of these struggles, Coldware (COLD)—a competitor with a growing presence in the Web3 space—is positioning itself to address the very issues Solana continues to face: scalability, transaction fees, and network congestion.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The cryptocurrency market is expected to rebound again, so investors are repositioning to maximize gains.

In anticipation of the following market spike, top Solana (SOL) wallets are investing in Ripple (XRP) and Rexas Finance (RXS).

With this shift, XRP’s cross-border payment solutions and RXS’s breakthrough real-world asset (RWA) tokenization approach are gaining trust.

These two projects are strategic investments with high appreciation potential in the quickly changing crypto ecosystem.

Solana Holders Switching to XRP and RXS: Why?

Solana, famed for its fast transactions and minimal costs, has remained popular in crypto. SOL whales diversify into XRP and RXS because of their tremendous growth potential as institutional attention moves to utility-driven assets.

Growth in relationships and legal clarity keep Ripple (XRP) at the top of global finance.

While Rexas Finance (RXS) pioneered RWA tokenization, real estate, commodities, and collectibles became tradeable digital assets for frictionless, decentralized investing.

XRP and RXS Becoming Top Picks

Ripple (XRP): Global Payments Leader

Ripple (XRP) has shown resiliency, especially since its partial SEC legal triumph. With institutional adoption and partnerships with global financial institutions, XRP can benefit from the growing demand for fast cross-border payments.

Reasons for XRP’s Rise

Regulatory Clarity: Ripple’s legal battles have helped financial institutions trust XRP for transactions.

XRP Accumulation: Payment and service institutions increasingly hold XRP, driving further institutional interest.

On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service: Ripple optimizes the cost and efficiency of cross-border transactions through its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service.

Cooperation: Large scale central banking and financial institutions validate and employ XRP, thus increasing its value.

Due to its discount from its prior highs, SOL investors are carefully accumulating XRP expecting a price breakout.

Rexas Finance (RXS): Asset Tokenization Future

Rexas Finance revolutionizes RWA tokenization to redefine blockchain investment. Rexas Finance turns financial assets into liquid, tradeable tokens by allowing ownership of fractional real estate, commodities, and intellectual property.

This innovation removes investment obstacles, expanding market involvement.

Massive Presale Success

Investor anticipation is high for Rexas Finance’s 12th and final presale. Highlights include:

Presale price increase: 600% from $0.03 to $0.20 in Stage 1.

Over $47.1 million raised, proving market demand.

RXS token sales reached 455.5 million, indicating investor confidence.

The exchange launched at $0.25 per token on June 19, 2025, setting the stage for significant post-listing appreciation. Analysts predict over 40,000% increases, making it one of the most valuable forthcoming listings.

Innovative Features Promote RXS Adoption

Rexas Token Builder lets non-coders construct digital assets.

Instant tokenization over Telegram and Discord using Rexas QuickMint Bot .

Property ownership is easier with Rexas Estate fractional real estate investments.

Rexas AI Shield eliminates smart contract vulnerabilities.

Deflationary Tokenomics ensure long—term stability. The system limits presales, liquidity pools, and staking to 1 billion RXS tokens.

Certik Audit verifies the security of Rexas Finance’s smart contract to build investor trust.

Major Listings — RXS will launch on three top 10 crypto exchanges, increasing liquidity and acceptance.

Community Growth and Market Excitement

In a $1 million competition, Rexas Finance gave the top 20 entrants $50,000 in RXS tokens. With over 1.6 million entries, the community is growing quickly, preparing for market launch. RXS demand is projected to soar after listing as investors realize its potential.

Why XRP and RXS Are Market Surge Favorites

Both XRP and RXS have benefits that make them excellent picks for the upcoming market rally:

XRP offers institutional-grade cross-border payment solutions, receiving regulatory certainty and widespread adoption.

RXS tokenizes assets, changing financial investments.

Both tokens have solid technical fundamentals and developing communities, improving their price appreciation potential.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

US authorities are returning $7 million to victims of spoofed crypto investment platforms.

The scammers gained victims' trust before directing them to fake investment websites that showed fake data indicating the victims' investments were growing.

The United States has recovered and cleared title to $7 million of investment fraud proceeds using civil asset forfeiture; victims may submit petitions to have the funds remitted back to them.


The stolen money was moved through more than 75 different bank accounts set up under shell companies that existed only on paper.

From these accounts, the funds were sent to banks outside the United States, disguised as normal domestic wire transfers.


The United States Secret Service took action in 2023, seizing some of the stolen funds from a foreign bank and starting a civil forfeiture action in a US District Court.

A foreign bank made its own claim against the seized money, and US authorities eventually reached a settlement agreement for $7 million of the funds.


Victims of this scam have been told to contact the Secret Service to petition to recover the money they lost to the fraudsters.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Tabit Insurance SCC has announced the capitalization of a $40 million insurance facility, funded entirely in Bitcoin.

According to Tabit, its use of BTC as capital is intended to provide an alternative source of capacity for the insurance industry.

The company operates as a segregated cell company, which allows for additional cells to be formed to deploy capital in the insurance sector. This structure also enables BTC holders to earn USD returns through their own segregated cells.

William Shihara, co-founder of Tabit, stated, “Our approach to capital allocation underscores our confidence in providing a steady hand to our partners.

The company emphasized that its reserves are verifiable on the blockchain through a proof-of-reserves model, which allows for real-time transparency beyond the typical quarterly disclosures in the insurance industry. 

Tabit is headquartered in Bridgetown, Barbados, a jurisdiction known for its captive insurance market and is a top ten global captive jurisdiction. The company states that Barbados’ regulatory framework provides oversight for its operations.

Tabit plans to work with insurance carriers, brokers, and organizations seeking additional capacity or alternative risk financing options. It also aims to collaborate with large holders of digital assets who want to generate USD income while maintaining BTC exposure.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Lisa Gordon, chair of investment bank Cavendish, proposes taxing crypto purchases while cutting taxes on stock investments.

Gordon believes stocks support the economy while crypto is "non-productive" and doesn't feed back into the economy.

The UK currently taxes shares listed on the London Stock Exchange at 0.5%, generating around 3 billion British pounds ($3.9 billion) in yearly revenue for the government.

Gordon suggests reducing this tax to encourage more Britons to invest in shares of local companies, creating a positive cycle for the economy.

Investment Trends Shifting in UK


The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) reported that about 12% of UK adults now own cryptocurrency, equal to around 7 million people.


Most crypto owners in the UK are under 55 years old, making up about 36% of all crypto holders in the country.

Gordon expressed worry that many Britons have "shifted to saving rather than investing", and this trend "is not going to fund a viable retirement" for many people.

A 2022 FCA survey found that while 70% of UK adults had savings accounts, only 38% owned shares either directly or through investment accounts.

The survey revealed nearly three in four 18-24 year olds held no investments at all.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://blockonomi.com/ethereum-eth-price-technical-analysis-shows-potential-breakout-above-2040-resistance/'>Ethereum (ETH) Price: Technical Analysis Shows Potential Breakout Above $2,040 Resistance</a></h2><b>Source:</b> blockonomi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 10:44:46 <p>
Ethereum price recovered above $1,880 and is trading around $2,032, showing signs of recovery after a prolonged correction.

Critical resistance levels at $2,020, $2,040, and $2,150 need to be broken for ETH to potentially reach $2,800 or even $4,000.

Institutional investors continue accumulating ETH, with wallets holding at least $100,000 worth of ETH growing from 70,000 to over 75,000 between March 10-22.

Major institutions like Fidelity and BlackRock are embracing Ethereum for blockchain tokenization, with BlackRock's ETH holdings crossing $1 billion.

Technical indicators suggest a potential 65% rally to $3,400 by June if ETH maintains support above $2,000.


ETH formed a base above the $1,820 level and started a recovery wave similar to Bitcoin’s recent movement. The price cleared several resistance levels at $1,880 and $1,920 before pushing above $1,950.

Currently trading around $2,032, Ethereum is facing hurdles near the $2,020 resistance zone. There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $1,980 on the hourly chart.


The first major resistance for ETH sits near the $2,040 level. Many analysts believe that breaking above this point could send the price toward the $2,120 resistance.

If Ethereum manages to break above $2,120, it might continue rising toward $2,150 or even $2,250 in the near term.


Initial support on the downside appears near the $1,980 level. The first major support sits at the $1,950 zone, with additional support levels at $1,880, $1,850, and $1,800.

Despite the recent price struggles, institutional investors have continued to accumulate ETH. According to Glassnode data, the number of wallets holding at least $100,000 worth of ETH grew from 70,000 on March 10 to over 75,000 by March 22.


Ethereum's futures open interest reached an unprecedented level on March 21. This suggests that large traders might be positioning themselves for a climb above $2,400.

Technical Analysis


Previous rebounds from this multi-year support have preceded gains of over 2,000% and 360% in earlier market cycles. If ETH maintains this support, it could potentially move toward $3,400 by June—representing a 65% rise from current levels.


Major financial institutions continue to show interest in Ethereum’s blockchain technology. Fidelity Investments recently filed with US regulators to register a tokenized version of its US dollar money market fund on Ethereum.

Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain for real-world asset tokenization, hosting over $3.3 billion worth of tokenized assets. This is substantially higher than its closest competitor, Stellar, with $465.6 million.


BlackRock's increasing Ethereum holdings reflect growing institutional confidence. Its BUIDL fund now holds nearly $1.145 billion worth of Ether, up from $990 million just a week earlier.

Many crypto analysts believe Ethereum must reclaim the “macro range” above $2,200 to reverse its three-month declining trend. According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, ETH needs to generate a strong enough reaction to reclaim the $2,196-$3,900 macro range.


For ETH to maintain bullish momentum, it must first overcome resistance at $2,020 and $2,040. Breaking past these levels could open the path toward higher targets at $2,120, $2,150, and beyond.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Peter Schiff, a known Bitcoin critic, asked for Bitcoin donations to his satirical “Bitcoin Strategic Reserve” for his 62nd birthday.

Schiff's reserve has collected over $4,500 in Bitcoin (0.05 BTC) and he recently moved it from an exchange to a hardware wallet.

He has been critical of the Trump administration’s plans for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, preferring gold or petroleum reserves.

Schiff has also started collecting Solana in what he calls his “Crypto Stockpile,” kept separate from his Bitcoin reserve.

Despite his long history of Bitcoin skepticism, Schiff claims he will “go down with the ship, like a true HODLer.”

Peter Schiff launched his reserve as a satirical response to the U.S. government’s plans to create a similar reserve.

The reserve now holds about 0.05 Bitcoin, worth around $4,500.

Most of this has come from small donations from the public.

Schiff announced he had moved his Bitcoin holdings from an exchange to a hardware wallet.

This step is often taken by long-term holders who want more security for their digital assets.

He insists that the Bitcoin in the reserve will never be sold or touched by him.

“My strategy is to go down with the ship, like a true HODLer!” Schiff wrote on social media platform X.

Beyond Bitcoin, Schiff has also started collecting Solana.

He keeps these tokens separate from his Bitcoin reserve in what he calls his “Crypto Stockpile,” which remains in his exchange wallet.

Schiff views Bitcoin as something for a long-term reserve, while treating Solana as something else entirely.

Despite creating his own reserve, Schiff continues to criticize the Trump administration’s plans for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

He has argued that governments should focus on strengthening existing reserves in gold or petroleum instead.

The crypto industry is using the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to scam more Americans into buying crypto.

Schiff wrote that thanks to Trump, more Americans will lose more money in crypto than in any prior speculative mania in history.

Schiff called a recent White House crypto summit a “disgrace” and “national embarrassment.”

He criticized the overly friendly relationship between the crypto industry and the current U.S. administration.

The $TRUMP meme coin has dropped more than 80% from its peak value, according to Schiff.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Donald Trump's official memecoin, TRUMP, surged 12% on Monday after he posted about it on Truth Social.

The token is currently trading at around $11.85, down 85% from its all-time high of $77.


Trading volume exceeded $1 billion after Trump's post, double the average of previous days.

The token has since retreated slightly, but remains the best performing cryptocurrency during Asian trading hours, according to CoinGecko data.

"I LOVE $TRUMP — SO COOL!!! The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!" Trump wrote to his 9.3 million Truth Social followers on Sunday.

The enthusiastic endorsement immediately caught investors' attention.

Despite the recent boost, the token remains far below its peak value.


The Solana-based memecoin was created on January 17, 2025.

It quickly captured the crypto community's attention in its early days.


Around 94% of TRUMP and MELANIA tokens are held by just 40 wallets, raising concerns about centralization within the token’s ecosystem.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its lawsuit against Ripple Labs, sparking optimism for XRP.

XRP has been gaining momentum among investors after the legal resolution, with analysts predicting a potential breakout from its current trading range.

The current price of XRP hovers around $2.39, forming a symmetrical triangle pattern between $2.35 and $2.55 on the chart.

Analysts predict that if XRP moves above the $2.40-$2.42 level, it could rally toward $2.55 and possibly reach $2.88.

However, if it fails to hold the $2.28 support level, the price might drop toward $2.18-$2.20 or even $2.00.

Technical indicators are showing mixed signals with a slight bullish tilt, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) standing at 51.45.

Some analysts predict that XRP could reach between $6 and $27 in 2025-2026 following what they describe as a "post-breakout correction."

Analyst Egrag Crypto has made similar predictions in the past, which critics have pointed out may be overly bullish.

The Ripple Labs IPO rumors are also contributing to the bullish sentiment for XRP.

Looking even further ahead, some analysts predict that XRP could reach $10 by 2030 based on several factors including regulatory clarity and adoption of Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin.

The daily price chart shows XRP moving within a descending triangle pattern, with the $2.88 level remaining a major resistance barrier.

A daily close above $2.55 could signal a shift in favor of bulls, while a close below $2.28 risks falling further toward $2.00 or even $1.85.

Lucie, Shiba Inu's community executive and marketing lead, suggests that SHIB is well-positioned for an ETF due to its presence on 110+ exchanges with 212 trading pairs.

SHIB burn rate surged dramatically (8,454% to 62,000% in recent reports), removing over 1 billion tokens from circulation.

Whale activity has increased, with dormant investors acquiring billions of SHIB tokens.

Current price hovers around $0.00001292-$0.00001303, up from a recent low of $0.00001085.

Price predictions range from moderate growth to reaching $0.000081 (a 500% surge) depending on market conditions.

Shiba Inu's price has stabilized in recent days, trading at approximately $0.00001303 as of latest reports. This represents a modest recovery from its year-to-date low of $0.00001085 earlier this month.

The meme coin remains about 62% below its November peak. This decline reduced its market capitalization from $19 billion to around $7.5 billion.


Recent developments have sparked renewed interest in the dog-themed cryptocurrency, with SHIB community executive Lucie highlighting factors that could make Shiba Inu a candidate for an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).

SHIB is listed on over 110 exchanges with 212 trading pairs—including all the major platforms.

It's basically everywhere: easy to access, easy to trade. Is SHIB good for an ETF?

YES. Will boomers invest in a “doggy coin”?

Also yes.


The ETF speculation comes amid broader market optimism around crypto-backed ETF filings. The US SEC recently acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for a Dogecoin ETF.

Canary Capital has filed an S-1 for SUI ETF approval. There are also rumors about a potential BlackRock Dogecoin ETF filing.


An extraordinary surge in SHIB's burn rate was reported, with an increase between 8,454% and 62,000% in recent days.

Over 1 billion tokens were burned in a 24-hour period. A single wallet address (0x55b8979a8d79f2802c79ff5a5083a0d7fdc182e3) was responsible for burning 1 billion tokens.


Market interest in SHIB derivatives has also increased. Shiba Inu futures open interest rose by 3.5% to $121.69 million, with derivatives volume spiking 24% to $71.18 million.

Whale activity has been another point of interest. Large investors have reportedly increased their SHIB holdings, with a previously dormant Ethereum whale acquiring billions of tokens.


The Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) indicator has risen to 82, up from the year-to-date low of 39. This suggests longer-term holding patterns among investors.


Technical analysts point to several patterns suggesting potential upward movement.

The coin has formed a falling wedge pattern, often considered a bullish sign.

The Percentage Price Oscillator and Relative Strength Index have tilted upwards.

Some analysts have identified a quadruple bottom at $0.00001235, potentially indicating a price floor.


Price predictions for SHIB vary widely. Conservative estimates suggest it could reach $0.000013 by the end of 2025, indicating modest growth.

More optimistic forecasts project values between $0.0000167 and $0.0000741.

Some analysts have even suggested a 500% surge to $0.000081, dependent on continued token burns and positive market sentiment.


One analyst has made a bold claim that SHIB could eventually reach $0.01, representing an 83,000% increase. This prediction cites SHIB's deflationary nature compared to Bitcoin's inflation, its utility through the Shibarium layer-2 network, and global partnerships.


However, challenges remain for SHIB's price recovery.

The cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, and regulatory developments could impact investor sentiment.

Competition from other meme coins and alternative cryptocurrencies could divert investment away from SHIB.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bitcoin regained momentum Sunday with a 2.7% increase after reports emerged from Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal about the White House’s narrowed tariff strategy.

The cryptocurrency’s resilience pushed it above $86,700 by Sunday midnight.

This represents a 3.3% gain for the day.

The broader crypto market followed suit with a 0.7% increase in total market cap, according to data from CoinGecko.

President Trump previously declared April 2 as “Liberation Day,” when he planned to impose sweeping tariffs across many economic sectors.

The administration now appears to be taking a more measured approach.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated last week that tariffs would apply to “about 15% of nations with persistent trade imbalances with the U.S.”

Global stock markets also responded positively to the news, with Europe’s Stoxx 600 index opening 0.5% higher on Monday.

S&P 500 futures added 0.9%, breaking a four-week streak of losses.

Daniel Murray, chief executive officer of EFG Asset Management in Zurich, explained the market reaction: “Markets have taken some comfort from news that the next stage of the Trump administration’s tariff regime will involve targeted tariffs.”

The Federal Reserve recently held interest rates steady, which along with cooling Consumer Price Index numbers (2.8% in February), has been interpreted by some investors as signs of easing financial conditions.

While tariffs do not directly impact Bitcoin prices in the short term, Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale, told Decrypt that Trump’s trade policies are part of a larger trend.

A Bloomberg study shows that President Trump’s implemented or threatened tariffs have affected at least $1.8 trillion in global trade.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Solana price jumped 7% to $140 with daily trading volumes surging 85-94.9% to $2.56-2.67 billion.

The renewed investor interest in Solana coincides with record-breaking network adoption, as on-chain data shows that the Solana network now has more than 11.09 million addresses holding the SOL token, marking an all-time high in user participation within the ecosystem.

Market Analysis

Technical analysis suggests Solana has achieved an important breakthrough, breaking past the crucial resistance level of $137 and potentially ending a persistent downtrend that began after the January 20th highs.

This technical breakout has sparked optimism among market analysts. Crypto Curb, a popular analyst, suggests this move signals the start of new upward momentum for SOL, with forecasts pointing to a potential rally toward $420 in the near future.

Another analyst, Satoshi Flipper, identified a symmetrical triangle pattern on Solana’s 4-hour chart, which typically signals a continuation of the previous trend once price breaks out of the formation.

The technical outlook remains positive as SOL extends its gains to trade above $138. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is recovering from oversold conditions and reads 49, pointing upward just below its neutral level of 50, indicating weakening bearish momentum.

Further support for this upward movement comes from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which showed a bullish crossover last week. This technical signal suggests more upside potential ahead.

The White House is narrowing its approach to tariffs set to take effect on April 2, and recent reports indicate that industry-specific tariffs will likely be omitted while applying reciprocal levies on targeted nations.

Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko advocates for Layer 1 solutions over Layer 2 alternatives, citing their superior performance with greater speed, lower costs, and enhanced security compared to Layer 2 scaling solutions.

Looking ahead, if Solana continues its upward trend, technical analysis suggests it could extend the rally by 15% from current trading levels to retest its next daily resistance at $160.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bitcoin trading at $87,127 as of Monday, March 24, 2025.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency has been experiencing high volatility in recent weeks. Price swings saw Bitcoin drop below $80,000 before rebounding to current levels around $87,000.

Rather than imposing broad industry-wide tariffs, the Trump administration is expected to target specific countries with major trade imbalances with the United States. This group, reportedly dubbed the “dirty 15,” could include major economies such as China, Japan, India, and Vietnam.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that countries might be able to negotiate to avoid higher tariffs. Nations could potentially reduce their own trade barriers as a way to avoid new U.S. tariffs.

Over 172,705 BTC have been acquired since February 23, indicating growing demand in the market.

This increase in demand mirrors similar activity seen after the FTX collapse. That period marked the bottom of the market before a recovery phase began.

Network data also shows encouraging signs of growth. Active Bitcoin addresses have risen by 0.96%, reaching a total of 8.7151 million users.

Transaction counts have surged by 1.66%, totaling nearly 500,000 transactions. These metrics highlight strong user engagement and reflect interest from both retail and institutional investors.

The NVT Golden Cross, a metric that analyzes the relationship between Bitcoin’s network value and transaction activity, has surged by 34.58%. This suggests strengthening network fundamentals and growing investor confidence.

Institutional investors continue to fuel Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have recorded six consecutive days of inflows, showing renewed demand from larger investors.

Japanese Bitcoin investment firm Metaplanet Inc has been increasing its holdings. The company currently holds over 3,200 BTC and plans to grow its reserves to 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025.

Arthur Hayes predicts Bitcoin could reach $110,000 before retesting the $76,500 mark again.

Market attention will focus on the Federal Reserve’s core PCE price index, the central bank’s preferred inflation gauge. Analysts expect a slight uptick from 2.6% to 2.7%, which could influence market sentiment for Bitcoin and other digital assets.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://blockonomi.com/us-treasury-removes-tornado-cash-from-sanctions-list-following-court-order/'>US Treasury Removes Tornado Cash from Sanctions List Following Court Order</a></h2><b>Source:</b> blockonomi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 09:29:24 <p>
The U.S. Treasury Department officially removed Tornado Cash from its sanctions list on March 21, 2025, reversing sanctions imposed in August 2022.

The cryptocurrency mixer had been accused of facilitating money laundering activities. Regulators claimed it helped process more than $7.6 billion worth of virtual assets since its creation in 2019.

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) had placed Tornado Cash on its Specially Designated Nationals list. They also targeted over 100 Ethereum wallet addresses associated with the platform.


The November 2024 court decision stated that OFAC “overstepped its congressionally defined authority.” The ruling centered on the fact that Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts cannot be considered “property” under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

Following the delisting, the Treasury Department argued the case should be considered resolved. They stated in court documents that because Tornado Cash had been removed from the sanctions list, the lawsuit was now “moot.”

The Treasury further claimed the court should assess whether it still has jurisdiction. They noted that federal courts have a “continuing obligation to satisfy itself” on matters of Article III jurisdiction.


Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal strongly disagrees with this approach. In a March 24 post on X, he criticized the Treasury’s attempt to avoid a final court judgment.

Grewal argues this is a textbook example of “voluntary cessation.” This legal principle applies when a defendant ends a contested action to avoid a court ruling.


The legal challenges began in September 2022. Six Tornado Cash users, led by Ethereum core developer Preston Van Loon and supported by Coinbase, sued the Treasury to reverse the sanctions.

Crypto policy advocacy group Coin Center filed a similar lawsuit in October 2022. While a Texas federal court initially sided with the Treasury in August 2023, an appeals court later ruled that the sanctions against Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts were unlawful.


The U.S. charged co-founders Roman Storm and Roman Semenov in August 2023 with helping launder over $1 billion in cryptocurrency through the platform.

Roman Semenov remains at large and appears on the FBI’s most wanted list. Roman Storm is currently free on a $2 million bond and expected to face trial in April.


Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev has seen some relief in his legal situation. A Dutch court suspended his pretrial detention, allowing him to be released from prison under electronic monitoring while he focuses on appealing his conviction.

In the midst of these legal proceedings, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the department’s commitment to fighting illicit finance.

The Treasury stated it remains dedicated to using its powers to combat malicious cyber actors. They specifically mentioned targeting North Korea’s ability to fund weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs through digital assets.


The ongoing dispute highlights the complex balance between regulating cryptocurrency services and respecting the decentralized nature of blockchain technology.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Tokyo-based Metaplanet has increased its Bitcoin holdings to 3,350 BTC (valued at $291 million) after purchasing an additional 150 BTC.

 

The average purchase price across all of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings is ¥12.60 million ($80,200) per BTC. The company has spent ¥42.22 billion ($270 million) in total on its Bitcoin acquisitions.

 

Metaplanet tracks its Bitcoin strategy using a metric called BTC Yield. This calculates the percentage increase in Bitcoin holdings compared to fully diluted shares over time.

 

The company’s BTC Yield was 41.7% from July to September 2024. It then jumped to 309.8% from October to December 2024 as Bitcoin prices soared.

 

For the first quarter of 2025 (January 1 to March 24), Metaplanet has achieved a BTC Yield of 68.3%. This shows continued growth in its Bitcoin holdings relative to shares.

 

Since Metaplanet began accumulating Bitcoin in April 2024, its stock price has risen by over 3,000%.

 

Eric Trump, son of U.S. President Donald Trump, has joined Metaplanet’s new strategic advisory board.

 

The appointment was announced on March 21, just days before the latest Bitcoin purchase.

Dogecoin is approaching a critical breakout point with strong support at $0.139-$0.17.

Analyst Kevin indicates that DOGE needs to maintain above $0.139 for bullish momentum.

Carl Moon predicts a potential 157% surge to $0.434 if DOGE breaks above $0.185.

Increased whale accumulation and network activity support a bullish outlook.

Recent price action shows DOGE tested $0.1650 and is attempting recovery toward $0.180.

The cryptocurrency has formed what analysts describe as a falling wedge pattern since its January peak of $0.435.

This pattern shows a series of lower highs and lower lows, narrowing toward what could be a major breakout point.

Crypto analyst Kevin highlighted the importance of the $0.139 support level for Dogecoin.

He noted that DOGE received a “weekly demand candle” at what he calls the “last line of bull market support.”

Maintaining this level is vital for the bullish case to remain intact.

These technical resets could signal diminishing downward pressure.

When such indicators reset from oversold conditions, they often precede price recoveries as selling exhaustion gives way to renewed buying interest.

According to Moon, if Dogecoin closes above $0.185 on the daily chart, it could confirm a structural breakout.

Following such a breakout, Moon projects a 157% rally.

This would take DOGE to approximately $0.434, nearly matching its previous high from earlier this year.

Analyst Whalesdesk identified strong support for Dogecoin between $0.16 and $0.17.

This support zone has prevented further downside movement and could serve as a launching pad for higher prices.

Whalesdesk outlined a more ambitious price target, suggesting DOGE could reach a four-year high of $0.60.

Before reaching this level, the cryptocurrency would need to overcome resistance areas at $0.30 and $0.45.

On-chain data shows growing whale activity supporting the bullish outlook.

Large holders have been accumulating DOGE at current price levels, which historically has preceded major price movements.

The Dogecoin network has seen increased user engagement in recent weeks.

Daily active addresses have grown, indicating more people are transacting with DOGE tokens.

Transaction volumes have also increased on the network.

Higher transaction activity often reflects growing demand for a cryptocurrency and can support price trends.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Pi Network price has dropped below $1, down 6.3% to around $0.94.

Upcoming token unlocks of 97.65 million Pi over 30 days could add more selling pressure.

Expert suggests burning 60-100 million Pi coins to help stabilize the price.


The Pi cryptocurrency's trading volume has increased by 12% to $284.36 million despite the price drop. This higher trading activity shows that investors remain interested in the token even as its value falls.

Market watchers point to several factors behind the recent price weakness. The lack of confirmation about a potential Binance listing has disappointed many investors who had hoped for wider exchange support.


A major concern for Pi holders is the upcoming token unlocks. Data shows that nearly 97.65 million Pi tokens worth approximately $93 million at current prices will be released into circulation over the next 30 days.

The daily average unlock rate stands at 3.25 million tokens. April 3rd will see the largest single-day unlock with 6.8 million Pi coins entering the market.


These massive unlocks could put more downward pressure on Pi Network's price. However, crypto expert Dr. Altcoin believes there might be a solution to this problem.

Dr. Altcoin suggested that the Pi Core Team should consider burning between 60-100 million Pi coins in the coming days.


The CEXs have been flooded with unlocked Pi coins, and the PTC will need to burn another 60 to 100 million coins from the circulating supply in the coming days in order to bring Pi back to $1.

Technical analysis provides some hope for Pi investors. The cryptocurrency has formed a falling wedge pattern, which often signals a bullish reversal.


Pi Network's challenges extend beyond price action. Transparency issues around the project's tokenomics have made major exchanges hesitant to list the coin.


The community members debate whether the delay in securing exchange listings stems from transparency issues or the Pi Core Team's unwillingness to pay listing fees.

A collaboration with PiDaoSwap aimed at enhancing transparency and governance within the ecosystem has been announced recently.


For Pi to regain its upward momentum, several catalysts could prove helpful. A token burn announcement would likely boost investor confidence by addressing concerns about oversupply.


Securing listings on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase would also significantly increase trading volume and visibility.

A broader recovery in the cryptocurrency market, particularly a strong Bitcoin rally, could lift Pi along with other altcoins.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bitcoin regained momentum Sunday and nudged up by as much as 2.7% following reports that the White House has signaled a more targeted approach to its April 2 tariffs.

The crypto market saw higher gains amid reports on Sunday afternoon from Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal that Trump's administration is narrowing its tariff strategy.

Bitcoin traded above $86,700 by Sunday midnight, roughly twelve hours after the aforementioned reports emerged, showing resilience after volatile swings over the past week.


The alpha crypto is up 3.3% on the day, while the rest of the market has tracked up by 0.7% in total market cap, data from CoinGecko shows.

This shift from a broader tariff implementation to a more targeted approach has eased concerns about immediate economic disruption.

Previous market fears had centered on Trump's declaration of April 2 as "Liberation Day," when he planned to impose sweeping tariffs across multiple sectors.


The Federal Reserve’s projections last week that it would hold interest rates steady, and two weeks before the Consumer Price Index saw cooling numbers, marking 2.8% from February.

Peter Schiff didn't want gifts for his 62nd birthday yesterday.

Schiff, a longtime financial commentator who was one of the few to forecast the 2008 economic crash and a founding member at Euro Pacific Asset Management, launched his so-called reserve earlier this month as a tongue-in-cheek jab at the U.S. government’s plans to introduce one.

So far, Schiff’s reserve has accumulated over $4,500, mostly from small donations.

And despite his long history of bitcoin skepticism, he insists he's in it for the long haul, claiming his strategy “is to go down with the ship, like a true HODLer!”

President Donald Trump endorsed the Official Trump (TRUMP) token on social media Sunday morning, directly promoting the Solana-based meme coin.

"I LOVE $TRUMP—SO COOL!!! The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Trump posted on TruthSocial at 10:33 AM ET, coinciding with a price surge that saw the token briefly top $12.25 before experiencing significant volatility.

The asset is up 7.7% on the day to $11.67, CoinGecko data shows. Still, it remains down 84% from its all-time high of $73.4 during the time it was launched January.

 

Luis Buenaventura, head of crypto at GCash, told Decrypt that this is "a sign that the market is no longer excitable about the Trump token," even though investors are aware "of its potential for small profits in short timescales."

While the token's website claims it is "not intended to be an investment opportunity," its value proposition appears inextricably linked to Trump's personal brand and ongoing promotion.

 

Andrew Rossow, digital media attorney and CEO of AR Media, a global brand impact consulting firm, told Decrypt that these activities have “unfortunately set a dangerous precedent for leveraging public office for personal financial gain."

Rossow cites three high-risk constitutional concerns. First is the Emoluments Clauses (Article 1, Sec. 9), which prohibit a sitting president from receiving financial benefits “from domestic entities or foreign governments without congressional approval.”

Because of its ownership structure, the TRUMP token allows “foreign actors to purchase tokens anonymously, potentially violating these clauses by enabling indirect financial gains or undue foreign influence” over U.S. policy.

Rossow further cites the Separation of Powers (Article II, Section 3), which requires the president to “faithfully execute laws.”

Trump’s endorsement of a financial product tied to his personal wealth “undermines regulatory agencies such as the SEC and CFTC, eroding trust in impartial governance,” Rossow told Decrypt.

Moreover, under provisions for the Equal Protection and Due Process in the Fifth Amendment, Rossow argues that preferential treatment for the tokens over others could “create an uneven playing field in the crypto market, disadvantaging competitors.”

 

Federal ethics laws “prohibit public officials from engaging in activities that create conflicts between their public duties and private interests,” Rossow explained.

Because of the affiliated entities’ ownership of 80% of the token supply, Trump’s involvement “directly conflicts with his role as president” and “undermines public trust in impartial governance.”

Earlier this month, World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance project associated with the Trump family and principals of DT Marks DEFI LLC, profited roughly $390 million from its second round of token sales.

The TRUMP token's launch follows the president's campaign pledges to make the U.S. a leader in crypto, including initiatives to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and an end to the Federal Reserve's independence via select crypto policy.

Senate Banking Committee Approves Nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin for Federal Reserve Board

The Senate Banking Committee has approved the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board. Raskin, who is currently serving as the deputy secretary of the Department of Treasury, was nominated by President Biden in January to fill one of two vacant seats on the Fed's seven-member board.

The committee voted along party lines, with all 12 Republicans voting against Raskin's nomination and all 10 Democrats supporting it. The full Senate is expected to vote on her nomination soon.


A second nominee for the Federal Reserve Board, Lisa Cook, was approved by the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month. However, she has not yet been confirmed by the full Senate.

Raskin's nomination has been contentious due to her views on climate change and banking regulation. Some Republicans have expressed concerns that she would push the Fed to prioritize environmental issues over traditional monetary policy goals.


The Federal Reserve is expected to play a key role in the Biden administration's efforts to combat climate change, particularly through its regulatory powers.

A report by the Congressional Research Service notes that the Fed has been increasingly focusing on climate-related issues and that Raskin's nomination could accelerate this trend.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Market data shows that in the minutes after Trump made the post, his eponymous cryptocurrency briefly rose before experiencing a sell-off.

The TRUMP token is trading at $11.91, or up around 9%, making it the best-performing crypto of the Asia trading day.

Ethena is up 8.9%, Bonk is up 8%, and Mantle is up 7%.

It's been a wild ride for the TRUMP token since its debut in January, soaring briefly to billions in market cap amid endorsements by President Trump himself before crashing 75% amidst broader market turmoil.

That brought the company's holdings to 506,137 BTC acquired for $33.7 billion, or an average cost of $66,608 each.

Strategy funded this latest acquisition via the sale of 1.975 million shares of common stock, which raised $592.6 million.

The company's latest preferred stock offering, $711 million of STRF, only priced late last week. To date, Strategy has sold 13,100 shares, raising $1.1 million, according to the filing.

MSTR is higher by 4.8% in premarket trading alongside a rally in bitcoin over the weekend to above $87,000.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The official memecoin of Donald Trump was the digital asset with the best performance on Monday during the Asian hours.

According to Coingecko data, after the president of the United States published in Truth Social "calling Trump" the best of all and great," its homonymous cryptocurrency went from approximately $10.93 to $12.25, a 12% increase minutes after publication.

After a brief fall, the Trump token quoted $11.91, with an increase of approximately 9%.

According to Coingecko, this makes it the best performance among digital assets during the Asian hours, with Ethena rising 8.9%, Bonk 8%, and Hold 7%.

The Coingesk 20, a measure of the largest digital assets' performance, has risen about 2%.

It has been a wild trip for the Token Trump since its debut in January, briefly rising to billions in market capitalization amid President Trump's social media activity.

The Democrats of the House of Representatives have introduced legislation to prohibit federal officials and their families from benefiting from meme coins.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project backed by President Donald Trump's family, has acquired substantial amounts of Mantle's MNT token following last week's major technological upgrade of the network.

WLFI purchased about 3.54 million MNT for nearly $3 million USDC for an average purchase price of 84 cents, according to data sources Lookonchain and Arkham Intelligence.

The recent purchase has increased WLFI's coin holdings, which include tokens like ETH, WBTC, TRX, LINK, AAVE, ENA, and others, to over $340 million. 

MNT is the native cryptocurrency of the Mantle Network, serving as a utility token for gas fees and a governance token for the layer 2 ecosystem focused on scaling Ethereum.

The Mantle Mainnet hard fork, or backwards-incompatible upgrade, took effect on March 19, activating EigenDA on the network. EigenDA is a secure, high-throughput, decentralized data availability service on Ethereum.

The EigenDA integration is said to boost Mantle Network's scalability without hitting data rate limits, reportedly resulting in a 15 MB/s throughput. In other words, the network can process more transactions per block.

MNT traded at 6% higher on the day at 83 cents at press time, according to data sources CoinDesk and TradingView.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Samuel Howe, director of Operations at Zodia Custody, has left the company based in London.

He took on a new position in the traditional finance sector (Tradfi), according to the company.

According to his LinkedIn profile, Howe had been in the position of Operations Director for three months.

Previously, he had been head of operations in cryptocurrency custodian.

Executive director Julian Sawyer said, "Sam left the company to return to traditional finances; this demonstrates the oscillation of roles and skills between crypt and traditional finances."

He is replaced by Sam Hill, who has worked with Zodia Custody during the last 18 months.

Before joining Zodia Custody, Howe was Chief of Operations at Crypt at the GSA Capital Coverage Fund.

He also served as Chief of Capital Markets Operations in the Coinshares Asset Administrator (CS).

Tabit Insurance, a Barbados-regulated insurance company, raised a $40 million reserve composed entirely of bitcoin to write traditional insurance and reinsurance business.

The insurer, which emerged in January this year, is claiming to be the first regulated risk carrier to rely on bitcoin-only reserves to write traditional policies priced in U.S. dollars.

The firm has a class 2 insurance license from the Barbados Financial Services Commission.

Tabit co-founder and CEO Stephen Stonberg said bitcoin holders are invited to contribute assets to the firm's system of segregated reserve cells, managed using non-custodial tech from Fireblocks, to earn yields of around 10%.

A good analogy from the world of insurance is the way accredited investors deploy assets into insurance syndicates at the Lloyd’s of London insurance market.

"For a technology like crypto, you may need a new underwriter, but the way the insurance is done is fundamentally the same as before," Stonberg said in an interview.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The SEC Crypto Task Force Roundtable was held on Friday, focusing on regulatory issues surrounding digital assets.

Since 1946, the Supreme Court's decision in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. has governed whether a product is a "security" or "commodity." The "Howey" test, which was made for citrus groves, does not cleanly apply to digital assets.


Congress is considering new legislation that resembles last year's FIT21 bill. This legislation will move past the outmoded Howey test and sharply define how particular digital assets are classified.

Friday's roundtable should have served as a jumping off point for ideas and proposals that the SEC could use as input to legislators considering the new legislative framework for crypto. However, much of the discussion focused on years-old debates about the four-party Howey Test, and philosophical discussions about the nature of securities.


Some participants made important proposals, such as focusing on the economic reality rather than the legal relationship between the issuer and the investor. Given the SEC and CFTC will likely share regulatory authority over digital assets in any new legislation, the line between the two regulators is very important to the crypto industry.

Congress is moving forward with its own answer to the question of when digital assets are securities, whether or not the SEC decides to provide Congress with any input.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The S&P 500 has moved above its 200-day moving average (200 DMA), after correcting as much as 10% in recent months.

The 200 DMA is calculated by taking the mean of the closing prices over the past 200 trading days and is often used to assess broader market trends and potential turning points.

The S&P 500 last crossed that gauge on March 10, and — though declining a bit shortly after — resumed an uptrend which has continued through today.

Bitcoin (BTC) topped $87,000 early Monday with solana (SOL), xrp (XRP) and dogecoin (DOGE) adding more than 4% to start the week in the green.

A risk-off mood persists, but is weakened amid reports suggesting that the U.S. tariffs due April 2 might be more measured than initially expected.

" Investors are remaining cautious on the upcoming price moment due to the uncertainty," Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, said in a Telegram message.

These reports can affect crypto markets. Strong consumer confidence and spending suggest a healthy economy, which might boost crypto prices as people invest more in riskier assets.

The U.S. economy is stronger than thought, making current price levels a good area to buy for those bullish in the medium to long term.

"U.S. 'hard' economic data remains robust and in contrast with the soft sentiment, suggesting an over-extrapolation of the current weakness versus underlying fundamentals," Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in an email.

U.S. exchange-traded funds tied to ether (ETH) have seen $401 million in net outflows so far in March, wiping out gains from the first two months of the year.

The redemptions represent nearly 6% of the total $6.77 billion in assets held by spot ether ETFs, according to data from SoSoValue.

January and February saw inflows of $101 million and $60 million, respectively, but March has seen net outflows instead.

In comparison, just one day this month—March 4—saw positive inflows, with $14.58 million added.

Spot bitcoin ETFs also faced withdrawals, with $893 million in net outflows this month.

The scale relative to assets under management, roughly 0.9% of $94.35 billion, was far less severe for bitcoin funds.

Bitcoin funds remain net positive for the year after strong inflows of $5.25 billion in January.

The contrast mirrors recent market performance, with ether having dropped roughly 8.5% since March 1, while bitcoin has gained more than 3%.

Year-to-date, ether has plunged over 37% to around $2,080, while bitcoin has fared better with a 7.5% decline to about $87,300.

Despite the downturn, ether ETFs still hold a net inflow of $2.42 billion since their launch, but that's dwarfed by the $36.05 billion pulled in by the bitcoin counterparts.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The buybacks mark a shift in how dYdX allocates its protocol revenue, with 40% going to stakers, 25% to the new program, 25% to its market-supporting MegaVault and 10% toward treasury initiatives.

The firm emerged as a prolific crypto industry investor in 2023, with much of its investments involving buying several million dollars' worth of a project's native token. The approach, which differs from the traditional venture capital model of investing in return for equity, drew some criticism from commentators.

DWF Labs' position as a market maker meant they kept their tokens on exchanges, indicating a risk they could sell them at any time.

Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase, criticized the U.S. Treasury's recent filing that seeks to moot the necessity of a final court judgment regarding Tornado Cash.

The Treasury Department's sanctions watchdog removed Tornado Cash from its global blacklist and over 100 ether (ETH) addresses from the Specially Designated Nationals list on Friday.

The platform was blacklisted in 2022 for its alleged role in laundering $445 million stolen by the North Korea-linked Lazarus cybercrime group.

The Treasury then argued that the action of delisting Tornado Cash resolved the issue at hand and that a final court ruling ordering it to remove the crypto mixer from its sanctions list was no longer necessary, according to a court filing dated March 21.

Grewal said the Treasury's attempts to have the case declared moot is an attempt to sidestep a ruling from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Under the voluntary cessation exception, a defendant's decision to end a challenged practice moots a case only if the defendant can show that the practice cannot 'reasonably be expected to recur,' Grewal said on X.

Coinbase funded the court case that made its way to the appeals court, Van Loon vs. Treasury, and Grewal cited the example of the FBI v. Fikre case, in which the government removed Yonas Fikre from the No Fly List.

However, the Ninth Circuit reversed that decision saying that the party seeking to moot a case based on its own voluntary cessation of challenged conduct must show that the conduct cannot “reasonably be expected to recur.”

The Treasury hasn't provided any assurance that it won't re-sanction Tornado Cash and Grewal noted that this lack of assurance will be made clear to the district court.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

While Bitcoin defenders see it as a digital version of gold, a new report by Global Bank Standard Chartered argues that investors should view it more as a technological asset.

Led by Geoff Kendrick, Stanchart's team found that Bitcoin's correlation with Nasdaq has been "almost always" stronger than with gold. The team said that while BTC can play a role as a refuge in cases of financial instability, such behavior is rarely needed.

"Investors can consider BTC as coverage against traditional finances and as part of their technological assignment," Kendrick said. He added that, at least "in the short term, BTC could be considered better as a technological asset than as a coverage against traditional finance problems."

The report proposed a remodeling of the index of the Magnificent 7 calls (MAG 7), replacing Tesla with Bitcoin to create a new "Mag 7B". The result was that MAG7B generated risk-adjusted profitability consistently higher than the original group during the last seven years.

Kendrick said that the MAG7B exceeded MAG7 in an average of around 1%, with an annual volatility almost 2% lower. He continued that this is a key advantage for institutional investors and large assets.

"BTC should be considered as a cryptocurrency with multiple functions in investor portfolios," Kendrick said. This would open the possibility of a greater number of institutional purchases, according to the report.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bitcoin (BTC) exceeded $ 87,000 on early Monday with Solana (Sol), XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (Doge) uploading more than 4% to start the week in green.

The risk aversion climate persists, but has weakened in a means of reports that suggests that US tariffs that will enter into force on April 2 could be more moderate than expected initially.

Consumer confidence measures the optimism of Americans with respect to the economy: a high level of trust means greater expense, while a low level means greater savings. Personal expense measures how much people buy, which is an important driver of economic growth.

These reports can affect crypto markets. Solid confidence and consumer spending suggest a healthy economy, which could boost cryptocurrency prices as people invest more in higher risk assets. A high PCE (growing inflation) could worry investors, promoting them to crypto as coverage against a weaker dollar.

However, if trust decreases and spending is slowed, it could indicate a recession, generating caution in investors and dragging cryptocurrency prices down.

"The hard 'economic data of the USA." Macroeconomic analysts, in general, have been more cautious in their evaluations than in reality, and we believe that the underlying economy remains stronger than was feared."

The crypto markets had a similarly quiet week, with prices that were maintained in a wide range and bouncing from recent minimums, reflecting the behavior of the actions.

Technically, prices maintain a negative bearish trend, but are stabilized around key support levels, with ETH establishing themselves at the maximum of the 2022 range and the next important level of support around 1500 points, Fan said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

While BTC may have a role as a place to hide in instances of financial instability, there's rarely a need for such hedges.
