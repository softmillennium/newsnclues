                <p>World Liberty Financial (WLFI) has launched a stablecoin called USD1 in the BNB Chain, according to data tracked by Lookochain.

The project team was prioritizing security and reliability before launching the market, as reported last October by Decrypt.

Zak Folkman, co-founder of WLFI, hinted at upcoming product releases after announcing $550 million in token sales earlier this month.

Folkman shared a conversation with Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, which will be "really big" in the coming weeks.

The project has formed alliances with blockchain protocols, including Chainlink and AAVE, to improve their defi offers.

Folkman stated that WLFI is building three main products: two are ready for launch, while one remains undisclosed.

The other two products are a loan and loan market driven by intelligent contracts and a protocol focused on real-world assets (RWA).

Unlike traditional defi loan platforms, World Liberty Financial will manage its loan market through its own governance process.

This allows the company to maintain control and adapt the platform to meet the specific needs of its users, particularly tradfi institutions.

Folkman explained that WLFI aims to provide a platform that integrates tradfi assets into the defi ecosystem without issues.

The company is committed to serving tradfi institutions, which require regulated and KYC-compliant platforms to enter defi.

World Liberty Financial's position as an American corporation with fully KYC'd principles makes it well-suited to serve as this bridge.

Folkman highlighted the impracticality of traditional defi governance for these institutions.

The company's strategy involves displaying its products in phases, starting with the loan protocol and followed by the RWA protocol.

These two protocols are expected to converge, enabling the creation of loan markets for assets supported by RWA.</p></b>

                <p>President Donald Trump's decentralized finance project World Liberty Financial has launched its own stablecoin on both Ethereum and Binance's BNB Chain.

The token, called USD1, marks the culmination of a plan that has been in the works for some months. 

With Trump back in the White House, and congressional Republicans racing to get a bill legalizing stablecoins over the finish line, it appears the World Liberty team feels the time is right for the president himself to enter the increasingly crowded—and lucrative—stablecoin market.

Stablecoins serve as key on- and off-ramps between crypto and traditional financial markets. They allow users to park on-chain funds in currencies that remain fixed in value even when crypto markets fluctuate.

The legality of stablecoins in the U.S., however, also remains an open question. The SEC, under former President Joe Biden, sued companies like Binance for issuing stablecoins, claiming the tokens violate existing securities laws.

If passed, though, the stablecoin bill currently making its way through Congress would put such legal uncertainty to bed. World Liberty's USD1 stablecoin is currently compatible for trading on Ethereum and on BNB Chain.

On Monday, Binance's founder and former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, celebrated the news, posting a welcome message to World Liberty on X.

Earlier this month, World Liberty announced it had completed two rounds of sales of its governance token, WLFI, netting some $550 million in the process.</p></b>

                <p>Bitcoin has appeared at the center of market speculation as it sees a potential recovery toward $90,000.

The latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is the main catalyst driving BTC’s recent prediction. The Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates has been a crucial driver for risk assets. Bitcoin responds positively to signs of monetary policy easing.

Historically, dovish Fed policies have fueled crypto rallies. As inflation cools and economic conditions stabilize, investors are increasingly bullish on Bitcoin's trajectory. 

As Bitcoin's rally fuels optimism across the broader crypto market, BinoFi’s 1700% surge signals broader market optimism.

Bitcoin's recent price action around $84,000 has placed traders on high alert as the Federal Reserve prepares to announce its latest stance on interest rates. While market consensus suggests that rates will remain unchanged, investors are watching for any dovish signals from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that could indicate a shift toward monetary easing.

Historically, Bitcoin has reacted strongly to changes in the Fed’s policy outlook. Lower interest rates typically fuel a rally in risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

Analysts point out that a more accommodative stance could propel Bitcoin past its 200-day moving average of $87,990. This move will set the stage for a push toward the key $90,000 level.

On-chain data also indicates that institutional demand remains strong, with major investors accumulating BTC ahead of the decision.</p></b>

                <p>The crypto market is shifting fast, with major developments reshaping the landscape. The XRP price surge is fueling speculation about a potential break past $3.

While these cryptos capitalize on bullish momentum, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making its biggest moves, nearing the end of its record-breaking presale. With $205.5 million raised and 18.8 billion BDAG sold, the network is now preparing for its Mainnet launch and 10 CEX listings this year.

Given BlockDAG’s ongoing growth and upcoming milestones, forecasts place BDAG at $1 in 2025, making it one of the best long-term cryptos to buy right now. 

XRP Price Surges 7%: Can It Break the $3 Barrier Next?

The recent XRP price surge has caught the market's attention, climbing 7% to $2.25 and sparking speculation about whether it can break the $3 barrier.

After rebounding from the $2.10 support level, XRP is showing strength, with analysts closely watching resistance at $2.40 and $2.60. A breakout beyond these levels could fuel further gains, making this XRP price surge one of the most significant in recent months.

Ethereum ETF Interest Rises as Staking Becomes a Key Price Driver

Recent reports suggest that Ethereum’s staking system could have a bigger impact on its price than the upcoming Pectra upgrade. Staking is becoming a major factor in Ethereum's value growth, potentially surpassing past technological improvements.

As interest in Ethereum ETFs grows, the addition of staking rewards could attract more institutional investors, boosting both liquidity and market confidence. Currently, Ethereum is trading around $1,860, with staking participation rates steadily increasing.

BlockDAG Presale Hits $205.5M as Mainnet & CEX Listings Approach

A crypto presale isn’t just about raising funds, it’s about building momentum before a project enters the open market. BlockDAG's presale momentum has garnered over $205.5 million, selling more than 18.8 billion BDAG coins.

The project is quickly approaching its $600 million target. With demand surging and BDAG's price rising from $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0248 in the current Batch 27, the network is preparing for its Mainnet launch and 10 CEX listings this year.</p></b>

                <p>Cryptocurrency investment products recorded $644 million in inflows last week, reversing five consecutive weeks of shedding assets.

Inflows to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds largely led the shift, followed by flows to Solana, Polygon and Chainlink investment products.

Total assets under management for crypto investment products rose 6.3% from their low point on March 10.

“Every day last week recorded inflows… signaling a decisive shift in sentiment toward the asset class,” said CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill.


Cryptocurrency funds have recorded massive outflows over the past few weeks as geopolitical and economic uncertainties drive investors away from risk-on assets.</p></b>

The goal is to make Dogecoin more practical and usable in everyday purchases, bridging the gap between transaction processing times and real-world usability.


House of Doge claims that blockchain transaction times have hindered digital assets from being commonplace in everyday payments.

The entity aims to install reward programs and merchant incentives for utilizing DOGE in payments.

It is expected to make its first strategic partnership announcement in the coming months.

                <p>The Bitcoin holdings of Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, recently surpassed 500,000 Bitcoin following its latest stock sales.

After acquiring 6,911 Bitcoin last week, the Tysons, Virginia-based firm said it now holds 506,137 Bitcoin valued at $44.2 billion, according to a press release.

The company said it purchased Bitcoin at an average price of $84,500 per coin, a slightly higher average price than the $83,000 that Strategy paid for 130 Bitcoin a week prior.

Strategy said that it sold nearly two million shares of its class A common stock, a move that resulted in around $593 million in net proceeds for the firm.

The company’s stock sale was linked to an at-the-market equity offering program unveiled in October, which authorized Strategy to sell up to $21 billion in common shares.

On Monday, the firm said it can still sell an additional $3.57 billion in Strategy’s stock through the program.

Strategy, which pivoted its focus from software to Bitcoin in 2020, said that it had raised $1.1 million by selling “perpetual strike preferred stock.”

The Nasdaq-listed product, dubbed Strike (STRK), was unveiled in January and features an 8% cumulative dividend that’s payable in either cash or class A common shares.

Strategy's co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor hinted at the company’s latest round of Bitcoin-buying, saying a chart tracking the company’s Bitcoin purchases “needs more orange.”</p></b>

                <p>Metaplanet Inc., a Japanese Bitcoin treasury company, has purchased an additional 150 BTC.

 
Japanese Bitcoin treasury company Metaplanet Inc. has just disclosed that it purchased a further 150 BTC. That brings the company's total Bitcoin holdings to 3,350 Bitcoin.

 

At time of publishing, that means the company holds just over $290 million, or in its local currency that's 42.216 billion yen. The Bitcoin price has inched past $88,000 after having gained 3.5% in the past day, according to CoinGecko data.

 

Before this purchase the company ranked as the tenth largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world.

 

The Japanese BTC treasury company, whose motto is "secure the future with Bitcoin," also recently announced Eric Trump, son of U.S. President Donald Trump, has joined its board of directors.

 

Eric Trump joins the "newly formed team of Strategic Board of Advisors", as posted on social media March 21.

 

Metaplanet has already shared intentions that it has a target to accumulate 10,000 BTC by 2025 and 21,000 BTC by 2026, with “Asia’s largest-ever equity capital raise for Bitcoin” already a work in progress.</p></b>

                <p>Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues its rapid ascent, selling over 300 million tokens and drawing strong investor interest.

On the other hand, PancakeSwap (CAKE) has encountered a downturn, with its value slipping amid reduced trading activity.

As the presale for MUTM accelerates, it is becoming evident that structured DeFi solutions are attracting substantial attention.

Mutuum Finance has seen a surge in investor enthusiasm, with its presale surpassing 300 million tokens sold and total funds raised exceeding $4.1 million.

Each phase of the presale is selling out faster, prompting more investors to secure their holdings before the next price adjustment.

What sets Mutuum Finance apart from many presale projects is its real-world DeFi use case.

Unlike speculative tokens that launch with hype but limited functionality, MUTM is backed by a structured lending and borrowing ecosystem.

This ensures sustained demand for the token, with a tangible financial framework supporting its growth.

Mutuum Finance is also undergoing a security audit by CertiK, reinforcing trust in the platform’s smart contract reliability.

PancakeSwap (CAKE) has experienced a notable decline, with CAKE’s price dropping by more than 10% and trading volume decreasing by nearly 25%.

Despite being one of the largest DEX platforms, PancakeSwap is facing growing competition in the DeFi sector.

Mutuum Finance is designed to sustain consistent demand for its token through its dual lending model.

A key innovation within Mutuum Finance is its overcollateralized stablecoin, ensuring robust liquidity without requiring a dedicated asset pool.

Users mint stablecoins by locking excess collateral, helping to maintain a stable supply and avoid sudden de-pegging issues.

Moreover, the platform incorporates a buy-and-distribute mechanism to reinforce long-term token demand.

The combination of an active DeFi ecosystem, structured financial model, and strong presale momentum positions MUTM as a highly attractive investment opportunity.

With its lending protocol, stablecoin integration, and built-in buy pressure mechanisms, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a top contender in the evolving DeFi landscape.</p></b>

                <p>A Solana token called Morning Routine (ROUTINE) has gained popularity as a meme coin.

Pump.fun launched ROUTINE on March 21, which soared to a $19 million market cap by Sunday.

The meme is inspired by a viral video of fitness influencer Ashton Hall documenting his morning routine.

The video shows Hall waking up at 3:52 AM and performing various activities, including two ice water facials.

Viewers find the video humorous due to its seriousness and absurdity.

ROUTINE's market cap retracted 57% to $8 million before surging 87.8% to $15 million.

A beta play on Saratoga Spring Water (SARAGOTA) has also gained traction, climbing to a $3 million market cap.

The surge in ROUTINE and SARAGOTA has revitalized the meme coin trenches.

More than 100 traders have profited over $10,000 from ROUTINE, according to DEX Screener.

Meme coins as a sector have started to recover, with FARTCOIN, SPX6900, and BONK gaining 80%, 68%, and 23% respectively.

The entire meme coin category has climbed 6.6% on the day.

However, not all meme coins are gaining traction, with TOSHI, UFD, and FWOG falling 17.7%, 15%, and 6% respectively.

Many traders believe this is the start of a second phase of meme coin mania.

The surge in ROUTINE has sparked hope for a return to the peak of last year's meme coin craze.

This development is seen as a sign that meme coins are turning a corner.</p></b>

                <p>The recent technical factors in the Shiba Inu (SHIB) network hint at a potential reversal that could reinstate its trading value and reignite investor confidence.

On the flip side, IntelMarkets (INTL) dominates the entire memecoin sector with its mind-blowing presale rush and jaw-dropping performance metrics hinting at a potential 27,900% rally before the next cycle.


Shiba Inu Price Moves to $0.000014: SHIB Holders Turn Bullish

Dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) is eyeing a push toward $0.000014, but a 236 billion SHIB supply could determine its next major move.

According to IntoTheBlock data, 236.46 billion SHIB are currently held at $0.000014 by 3,780 addresses.

A breach of this minor resistance would allow SHIB to reach $0.000014 and aim for a potential breakout.


Technical Factors Hint at a Potential Shiba Inu Price Recovery

In a recent tweet, IntoTheBlock reported that the combined memecoin market cap had returned to levels seen in the third quarter of last year and highlighted key on-chain indicators to watch for a shift.

For the past two days, the Shiba Inu price has oscillated in a tight range between $0.00001227 and $0.000013 as traders await the market’s next move.


SHIB Whales Stack Up IntelMarkets Before 27,900% Rally

IntelMarkets (INTL) recently received 10,000 weekly signups after most SHIB investors moved their capital into this emerging AI entrant.

Most memecoin holders are prioritizing IntelMarkets over other memecoin projects because this platform offers AI-powered insights and holistic trading signals with its Intelli-M capability.</p></b>

                <p>On Friday, Maryland Delegate Adrian Boafo (D) and New York Assemblyman Clyde Vanel (D) sent a joint letter to Democratic Congressional leaders urging them to pass comprehensive crypto legislation at the federal level.

The elected officials cited New York State as being a leader in crypto regulation and proposed that New York's BitLicense be used as a model for what federal crypto regulation should look like. They also noted that New York State has placed a two-year moratorium on proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining that uses fossil fuels.

This realization led the author to compare this proposal to former Vice President Harris's suggestion of creating a regulatory framework that protects Black men who invest in and own cryptocurrency assets.

The author notes that they are in favor of a regulatory framework that protects all people, regardless of race or gender, to invest in crypto assets. The author then explains why the U.S. federal government's creating something comparable to New York's BitLicense and putting a mining moratorium on Bitcoin miners that use any amount of fossil fuels would be a bad idea.

The BitLicense requires virtual currency businesses operating in New York State to obtain a license, which takes months to years to complete and costs upward of $100,000. This has led to many established companies in the space not obtaining the license, and New York residents cannot use reputable platforms like Strike, River, Swan, and Kraken.

The author is also critical of the BitLicense's impact on innovation and entrepreneurship, stating that it would stifle growth by creating a moat around large companies while shutting out startups. They also argue that this would hinder President Trump's goal of making the United States the Bitcoin superpower and crypto capital of the world.

The mining moratorium proposed by Delegate Boafo and Assemblyman Vanel prohibits proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining that uses fossil fuels in New York State. The author is critical of this proposal, stating that it is virtue signaling rather than an actual effort to address environmental damage caused by fossil fuels.

They argue that if politicians were serious about addressing environmental damage, they would implement more comprehensive policies, such as a moratorium on all companies using fossil fuels or banning internal combustion engine cars. The author also argues that this proposal would put many Americans out of work and cede hashrate to hostile foreign powers who use fossil fuels to mine Bitcoin.

The author pleads with Democrats to stop proposing regulation that hurts the industry, which could provide high-quality jobs for many Americans. They urge them to listen to forward-thinking Democrats like Congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA), Congressman Ritchie Torres (D-NY), and former Congressman Wiley Nickel (D-NC).</p></b>

                <p>Lava is building a lending platform that allows users to borrow dollars against their Bitcoin holdings.

Lava's lending model provides liquidity without forcing users to sell their Bitcoin, preserving the original stash while allowing them to spend dollars.

The platform offers 7.5% interest on borrowed funds and allows users to repay loans in either USD or BTC.

Lava aims to provide a solution for individuals who want to use their Bitcoin holdings but don't want to sell them.

Users can borrow up to 50% of the value of their Bitcoin holdings, with the option to extend repayment terms.

The platform also plans to integrate with other financial services and products to create a more comprehensive ecosystem.

Lava's lending model is designed to be self-custodial, allowing users to maintain control over their funds and assets at all times.

The company aims to provide a secure and reliable solution for individuals who want to use their Bitcoin holdings without having to sell them.

Lava plans to expand its services to other countries and regions in the future.

Spending BTC directly with merchants or individuals is often hailed as a step toward Hyperbitcoinization – the hypothetical scenario where BTC becomes the dominant global currency.

This approach strengthens Bitcoin's network effect, encourages adoption, and aligns with its peer-to-peer philosophy, bypassing intermediaries like banks.

However, this strategy faces significant hurdles, including tax conditions in many jurisdictions that impose restrictive burdens on spending BTC.

In the U.S., the IRS treats BTC as property, meaning each transaction triggers a taxable event.

Selling or spending BTC at a profit incurs capital gains tax – up to 37% for short-term gains or 20% for long-term holdings.

This complexity discourages direct spending, as users must track cost basis, report gains, and navigate administrative overhead.

For instance, a $1,000 BTC purchase spent at $10,000 would trigger a $2,800 tax liability (assuming a 28% effective rate).

Mitigation Strategy: Buy-Back Mechanism

To balance the desire to spend with BTC retention, a buy-back strategy offers a pragmatic solution.

After borrowing dollars against BTC via Lava's platform, users can spend these funds while committing to repurchase BTC at a later date when market conditions or personal finances allow.

This approach leverages Lava's self-custodial lending to access liquidity without selling, preserving the original BTC stash.

The buy-back can be timed to capitalize on market dips or post-tax season liquidity, potentially at lower prices, enhancing overall holdings.</p></b>

                <p>The cryptocurrency market is heating up as Solana (SOL) nears a major breakout, sparking discussions about its future.

With a price consolidation around the $125 mark, many are wondering if Solana will break its resistance levels and lead the next bull rally. However, amidst this excitement, a newcomer—Coldware (COLD)—is quietly building momentum, and investors are increasingly turning their attention to this Web3 powerhouse.


Unlike Solana, Coldware (COLD) is integrating blockchain technology with Internet of Things (IoT) solutions in a decentralized manner. This fusion of IoT and Web3 is what sets Coldware apart from existing Layer-1 competitors like Solana (SOL). While Solana has made strides in scalability, it has struggled to maintain a seamless, fault-tolerant infrastructure for high-demand, real-world applications.


Coldware (COLD) uses Layer-2 solutions, designed to offload transactional burdens from the main network, making Coldware capable of handling the heavy throughput demands of IoT applications. This architecture ensures that Coldware (COLD) maintains a high level of security, efficiency, and scalability that Solana (SOL) has yet to achieve consistently.


While Solana remains a major competitor in the blockchain space, Coldware (COLD) is focused on real-world adoption, integrating blockchain with everyday technology like IoT devices. As the IoT market is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself as a solution to the critical needs of low-cost, high-efficiency IoT transactions.


The Coldware (COLD) platform supports an advanced decentralized network for IoT, offering greater security, scalability, and cost efficiency compared to Solana’s approach. By utilizing a Layer-2 system for rapid transactions and reduced congestion, Coldware holds the potential to redefine the future of IoT-enabled Web3 technology.

Furthermore, Coldware (COLD) stands out because of its unique ability to handle a wider array of decentralized applications (dApps) and real-world use cases in industries beyond finance. While Solana (SOL) may excel in DeFi applications, Coldware (COLD) can scale efficiently across industries like smart homes, healthcare, and logistics.


Solana’s Path to Potential Breakout

Over the past week, Solana (SOL) has faced fluctuating market conditions. The $136 highs from early in the week gave way to a more stable range of around $125. Despite setbacks, the network has seen increased activity, and many are forecasting a breakout in the coming weeks.


Solana’s Layer-1 solution has been lauded for its speed and low-cost transactions, making it a favorite among developers and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. But as the ecosystem expands, Solana has faced significant network downtimes and congestion, which have put the future of its performance in question.


In light of these struggles, Coldware (COLD)—a competitor with a growing presence in the Web3 space—is positioning itself to address the very issues Solana continues to face: scalability, transaction fees, and network congestion.


Looking Ahead: Solana’s Role vs. Coldware’s Growth

As Solana (SOL) approaches key resistance levels in its current cycle, the market is eagerly anticipating whether it will break through or face another setback. Meanwhile, Coldware (COLD) is quietly but steadily gaining attention as it nears Day 3 before the official launch of its site.


The growing Web3 landscape is becoming more competitive, and Coldware’s unique approach to integrating IoT with blockchain could see it taking the lead in this new frontier.


While Solana may continue to maintain its position in the blockchain market, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a future-ready solution capable of surpassing Solana in providing a fully decentralized and scalable network for real-world applications.</p></b>

                <p>The cryptocurrency market is expected to rebound again, so investors are repositioning to maximize gains.

In anticipation of the following market spike, top Solana (SOL) wallets are investing in Ripple (XRP) and Rexas Finance (RXS).

With this shift, XRP’s cross-border payment solutions and RXS’s breakthrough real-world asset (RWA) tokenization approach are gaining trust.

These two projects are strategic investments with high appreciation potential in the quickly changing crypto ecosystem.

Solana Holders Switching to XRP and RXS: Why?

Solana, famed for its fast transactions and minimal costs, has remained popular in crypto. SOL whales diversify into XRP and RXS because of their tremendous growth potential as institutional attention moves to utility-driven assets.

Growth in relationships and legal clarity keep Ripple (XRP) at the top of global finance.

While Rexas Finance (RXS) pioneered RWA tokenization, real estate, commodities, and collectibles became tradeable digital assets for frictionless, decentralized investing.

Ripple (XRP): Global Payments Leader

Ripple (XRP) has shown resiliency, especially since its partial SEC legal triumph. With institutional adoption and partnerships with global financial institutions, XRP can benefit from the growing demand for fast cross-border payments.

Regulatory Clarity: Ripple’s legal battles have helped financial institutions trust XRP for transactions.

XRP Accumulation: Payment and service institutions increasingly hold XRP, driving further institutional interest.

On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service: Ripple optimizes the cost and efficiency of cross-border transactions through its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service.

Cooperation: Large scale central banking and financial institutions validate and employ XRP, thus increasing its value.

Rexas Finance (RXS): Asset Tokenization Future

Rexas Finance revolutionizes RWA tokenization to redefine blockchain investment. Rexas Finance turns financial assets into liquid, tradeable tokens by allowing ownership of fractional real estate, commodities, and intellectual property.

This innovation removes investment obstacles, expanding market involvement.

Massive Presale Success

Investor anticipation is high for Rexas Finance’s 12th and final presale. Highlights include:

Presale price increase: 600% from $0.03 to $0.20 in Stage 1.

Over $47.1 million raised, proving market demand.

RXS token sales reached 455.5 million, indicating investor confidence.

The exchange launched at $0.25 per token on June 19, 2025, setting the stage for significant post-listing appreciation.

Analysts predict over 40,000% increases, making it one of the most valuable forthcoming listings.

Innovative Features Promote RXS Adoption

Rexas Token Builder lets non-coders construct digital assets.

Instant tokenization over Telegram and Discord using Rexas QuickMint Bot .

Property ownership is easier with Rexas Estate fractional real estate investments.

Rexas AI Shield eliminates smart contract vulnerabilities.

Deflationary Tokenomics ensure long—term stability. The system limits presales, liquidity pools, and staking to 1 billion RXS tokens.

Certik Audit verifies the security of Rexas Finance’s smart contract to build investor trust.

                <p>US authorities are returning $7 million to victims of spoofed crypto investment platforms.

Scammers gained victims' trust before directing them to fake investment websites that looked like legitimate cryptocurrency investment platforms.


The stolen funds were funneled through more than 75 different shell company bank accounts and sent abroad.

Secret Service seized funds from a foreign bank in 2023 and initiated civil forfeiture.

Victims can contact the Secret Service to petition for recovery of their losses.

US authorities have begun the process of returning $7 million to victims who were tricked into sending money to fake cryptocurrency investment platforms.

The scam involved fraudsters who contacted victims and built trust with them over time.


After gaining their confidence, the scammers directed victims to websites that looked like legitimate cryptocurrency investment platforms.


These websites were designed to fool victims into thinking they were investing in real crypto opportunities.


The sites showed fake data indicating that the victims' investments were growing and making good returns.

When victims tried to withdraw their money, the scammers used pressure tactics to get them to invest even more.

One common method was claiming that victims needed to pay taxes on their supposed profits before they could access their funds.</p></b>

                <p>Tabit Insurance SCC has announced the capitalization of a $40 million insurance facility, funded entirely in Bitcoin.

This marks the first time a property and casualty (P&C) insurer has held all of its regulatory reserves in BTC while continuing to denominate its insurance policies and premiums in U.S. dollars.

The company expressed the benefits of its funding approach, allowing regulators and auditors to verify reserves in real-time.

Tabit's use of BTC as capital is intended to provide an alternative source of capacity for the insurance industry.

William Shihara, co-founder of Tabit, stated, “Our approach to capital allocation underscores our confidence in providing a steady hand to our partners."

At Tabit, we saw a clear opportunity to enhance transparency within an industry that has been sorely lacking in innovation,” said Stephen Stonberg, co-founder and CEO.

Tabit plans to work with insurance carriers, brokers, and organizations seeking additional capacity or alternative risk financing options.

It also aims to collaborate with large holders of digital assets who want to generate USD income while maintaining BTC exposure.</p></b>

                <p>A top UK investment banker, Lisa Gordon, has called for taxes on cryptocurrency purchases to help direct more investment into the stock market.

Gordon, chair of investment bank Cavendish, believes such a move could boost the UK economy.

The current tax burden on shares listed on the London Stock Exchange is 0.5%, bringing in around £3 billion in yearly revenue for the government.


Over half of UK adults under 45 own crypto but no equities.

Gordon argues that stocks support the economy while crypto is “non-productive.”

UK stock market listings declined to just 18 companies in 2023, while 88 companies delisted.


Gordon suggested a policy shift that would reduce the existing tax burden on stock purchases while creating a new tax on cryptocurrency transactions.

She stated, "I would love to see stamp duty cut on equities and applied to crypto."

A 0.5% tax on shares listed on the London Stock Exchange currently brings in around £3 billion in yearly revenue for the government.


Gordon believes reducing this tax could encourage more Britons to invest in shares of local companies.

This shift could then motivate more companies to list on UK exchanges, creating a positive cycle for the economy.


The FCA reported that about 12% of UK adults now own cryptocurrency, equal to around 7 million people.

Most crypto owners in the UK are under 55 years old, making up about 36% of all crypto holders in the country.


Gordon expressed worry that many Britons have “shifted to saving rather than investing.”

She warned this trend “is not going to fund a viable retirement” for many people.</p></b>

                <p>Ethereum price recovered above $1,880 and is trading around $2,032, showing signs of recovery after a prolonged correction.

Critical resistance levels at $2,020, $2,040, and $2,150 need to be broken for ETH to potentially reach $2,800 or even $4,000

Institutional investors continue accumulating ETH, with wallets holding at least $100,000 worth of ETH growing from 70,000 to over 75,000 between March 10-22.

Major institutions like Fidelity and BlackRock are embracing Ethereum for blockchain tokenization, with BlackRock’s ETH holdings crossing $1 billion

Technical indicators suggest a potential 65% rally to $3,400 by June if ETH maintains support above $2,000

ETH formed a base above the $1,820 level and started a recovery wave similar to Bitcoin’s recent movement.

The price cleared several resistance levels at $1,880 and $1,920 before pushing above $1,950.

Currently trading around $2,032, Ethereum is facing hurdles near the $2,020 resistance zone. There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $1,980 on the hourly chart.

The first major resistance for ETH sits near the $2,040 level.

Many analysts believe that breaking above this point could send the price toward the $2,120 resistance

If Ethereum manages to break above $2,120, it might continue rising toward $2,150 or even $2,250 in the near term. However, failure to clear these resistance levels could trigger another decline

Initial support on the downside appears near the $1,980 level.

The first major support sits at the $1,950 zone, with additional support levels at $1,880, $1,850, and $1,800.

Despite the recent price struggles, institutional investors have continued to accumulate ETH.

According to Glassnode data, the number of wallets holding at least $100,000 worth of ETH grew from 70,000 on March 10 to over 75,000 by March 22

Nansen’s analyst Nicolai Sondergaard highlighted that Ethereum whales with balances between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have increased their positions.

This comes while smaller holders have been reducing their ETH holdings

Ethereum’s futures open interest reached an unprecedented level on March 21. This suggests that large traders might be positioning themselves for a climb above $2,400

Technical indicators point to a possible major comeback for ETH.

With the price hovering close to $2,000, a crucial long-term support level, historical patterns suggest potential for strong rallies.

Previous rebounds from this multi-year support have preceded gains of over 2,000% and 360% in earlier market cycles. If ETH maintains this support, it could potentially move toward $3,400 by June—representing a 65% rise from current levels.

Major financial institutions continue to show interest in Ethereum’s blockchain technology.

Fidelity Investments recently filed with US regulators to register a tokenized version of its US dollar money market fund on Ethereum

The $5.8 trillion asset manager plans to launch “OnChain” to track transactions of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund, an $80 billion fund primarily consisting of US Treasury bills.

Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain for real-world asset tokenization, hosting over $3.3 billion worth of tokenized assets

This is substantially higher than its closest competitor, Stellar, with $465.6 million

BlackRock’s increasing Ethereum holdings reflect growing institutional confidence. Its BUIDL fund now holds nearly $1.145 billion worth of Ether, up from $990 million just a week earlier.

Many crypto analysts believe Ethereum must reclaim the “macro range” above $2,200 to reverse its three-month declining trend

According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, ETH needs to generate a strong enough reaction to reclaim the $2,196-$3,900 macro range.

While short-term market volatility may continue due to global economic concerns, the long-term outlook for Ethereum appears positive

Investment firm VanEck projects a $6,000 price target for ETH during 2025, representing a substantial increase from current levels.</p></b>

                <p>Peter Schiff, a known Bitcoin critic, asked for Bitcoin donations to his satirical “Bitcoin Strategic Reserve” for his 62nd birthday.

Schiff’s reserve has collected over $4,500 in Bitcoin (0.05 BTC) and he recently moved it from an exchange to a hardware wallet.

He has been critical of the Trump administration’s plans for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, preferring gold or petroleum reserves.

Despite his long history of Bitcoin skepticism, Schiff claims he will “go down with the ship, like a true HODLer”

Peter Schiff launched his reserve earlier this month as a satirical response to the U.S. government’s plans to create a similar reserve.

The move comes as a surprise to many, given his well-known skepticism about cryptocurrencies.

The reserve now holds about 0.05 Bitcoin, worth around $4,500.

Most of this has come from small donations from the public.

In a recent update, Schiff announced he had moved his Bitcoin holdings from an exchange to a hardware wallet.

This step is often taken by long-term holders who want more security for their digital assets.

Schiff has made it clear that contributions to his reserve are not personal donations.

He insists that the Bitcoin in the reserve will never be sold or touched by him.

Beyond Bitcoin, Schiff has also started collecting Solana. He keeps these tokens separate from his Bitcoin reserve in what he calls his “Crypto Stockpile.”

The crypto industry is using the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to scam more Americans into buying crypto.

Thanks to Trump, more Americans will lose more money in crypto than in any prior speculative mania in history.

Schiff wrote on March 20, 2025.

Despite creating his own reserve, Schiff continues to criticize the Trump administration’s plans for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

He has argued that governments should focus on strengthening existing reserves in gold or petroleum instead.

The more money a country diverts to crypto, the less capital it has to fund the production of real goods and legitimate wealth creation.

Schiff wrote on March 7.

This waste of resources is exactly what our Founding Fathers warned us against.</p></b>

                <p>Donald Trump's official memecoin, TRUMP, jumped 12% on Monday after he posted about it on Truth Social, calling it "the greatest of them all" and "cool".

The token has since retreated slightly and is currently trading at around $11.85.

President Trump wrote to his followers: "I LOVE $TRUMP — SO COOL!!! The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

The enthusiastic endorsement immediately caught investors' attention, and the surge in price was accompanied by a spike in trading volume, reaching over $1 billion, which is double the average volume of previous days.

Despite the recent boost, the token remains far below its peak value, down approximately 85% from its all-time high of $77 reached shortly after its launch.

The Solana-based memecoin was created on January 17, 2025.

It quickly captured the crypto community's attention in its early days and reached a peak market capitalization of about $15 billion just two days after its launch.

A Chainalysis report revealed that around 94% of TRUMP and MELANIA tokens are held by just 40 wallets.

This concentration raises concerns about centralization within the token's ecosystem, as a small number of "whale" holders could have major influence over the token's price.

The memecoin faces additional challenges in the coming weeks with the unlock of 40 million TRUMP tokens on April 18, representing about 4% of the total supply and valued at over $472 million.

After this initial unlock, at least half a million TRUMP tokens will enter circulation daily until the end of 2027, which some investors worry could increase selling pressure.

The token has also drawn political attention, with House Democrats introducing the MEME Act to prohibit federal officials and their families from profiting off meme coins.</p></b>

                <p>SEC dropped its lawsuit against Ripple Labs, sparking optimism for XRP.

Analysts predict XRP could reach $6-$27 in 2025-2026, with longer-term targets of $10 by 2030.

XRP currently trading in $2.35-$2.55 range, forming a symmetrical triangle pattern.


Technical indicators show mixed signals with RSI at 51.45 indicating balanced pressure.

Ripple Labs IPO rumors further boosting bullish sentiment for XRP.

The current price of XRP hovers around $2.39.

It has been trading in a range between $2.35 and $2.55, forming what analysts call a symmetrical triangle pattern.

This pattern often suggests a breakout is coming soon.

Bitget analyst Ryan Lee noted that a breakout from this trading range could lead to large price movements.

The exponential moving averages on the 4-hour chart are converging near current levels.

The 20 EMA sits at $2.39 while the 200 EMA is at $2.40, acting as immediate resistance for the price.


Technical Analysis

If XRP moves above the $2.40-$2.42 level, it could rally toward $2.55 and possibly reach $2.88.

However, if it fails to hold the $2.28 support level, the price might drop toward $2.18-$2.20 or even $2.00.


Looking at longer-term forecasts, some analysts are very optimistic about XRP’s future.

Analyst Egrag Crypto predicts the token could reach between $6 and $27 between 2025 and 2026.

According to Egrag’s analysis, XRP had a 283% recovery after breaking out of a symmetrical triangle pattern following the US election in November 2024.


Not everyone agrees with these high price targets.

Critics point out that Egrag has made overly bullish predictions in the past.

Some also argue that his forecast doesn’t account for “diminishing returns” across market cycles as the cryptocurrency market matures.


Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, noted that XRP has shown less volatility during recent crypto market selloffs.

This could be a sign that sentiment is leaning bullish for XRP.

Looking even further ahead, some analysts predict XRP could reach $10 by 2030.


The IPO rumors have been heating up recently.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse mentioned in an interview last week that going public was “possible,” which has provided more reasons for bullish positioning.</p></b>

Price predictions range from moderate growth to reaching $0.000081 (a 500% surge) depending on market conditions.

Shiba Inu’s price has stabilized in recent days, trading at approximately $0.00001303 as of latest reports.


The meme coin remains about 62% below its November peak. This decline reduced its market capitalization from $19 billion to around $7.5 billion.

SHIB is listed on over 110 exchanges with 212 trading pairs—including all the major platforms.

It’s basically everywhere: easy to access, easy to trade.

SHIB isn’t just a meme—it’s decentralized, community-driven, and built to last.”

The ETF speculation comes amid broader market optimism around crypto-backed ETF filings.


The US SEC recently acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for a Dogecoin ETF.

Canary Capital has filed an S-1 for SUI ETF approval. There are also rumors about a potential BlackRock Dogecoin ETF filing.

Adding to investor optimism is an extraordinary surge in SHIB’s burn rate. Reports indicate an increase between 8,454% and 62,000% in recent days.

Over 1 billion tokens were burned in a 24-hour period.


Market interest in SHIB derivatives has also increased. Shiba Inu futures open interest rose by 3.5% to $121.69 million, with derivatives volume spiking 24% to $71.18 million.

Whale activity has been another point of interest. Large investors have reportedly increased their SHIB holdings, with a previously dormant Ethereum whale acquiring billions of tokens.


The Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) indicator has risen to 82, up from the year-to-date low of 39. This suggests longer-term holding patterns among investors.

Technical analysts point to several patterns suggesting potential upward movement. The coin has formed a falling wedge pattern, often considered a bullish sign.


The Percentage Price Oscillator and Relative Strength Index have tilted upwards. Some analysts have identified a quadruple bottom at $0.00001235, potentially indicating a price floor.


Price predictions for SHIB vary widely. Conservative estimates suggest it could reach $0.000013 by the end of 2025, indicating modest growth.

More optimistic forecasts project values between $0.0000167 and $0.0000741.

Some analysts have even suggested a 500% surge to $0.000081, dependent on continued token burns and positive market sentiment.


However, challenges remain for SHIB’s price recovery. The cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, and regulatory developments could impact investor sentiment.


Competition from other meme coins and alternative cryptocurrencies could divert investment away from SHIB.</p></b>

                <p>White House signals more targeted approach to April 2 tariffs, leading to Bitcoin gaining 2.7%

Bitcoin traded above $86,700 Sunday, showing resilience after volatile swings last week.

President Trump hinted at “flexibility” in tariff plans, particularly regarding China.

Global markets showed a positive reaction with S&P 500 futures adding 0.9% on news of targeted tariffs.

Economic forecasts show reduced GDP expectations for US (2.2% for 2025) and globally (3.1% for 2025).

Bitcoin regained momentum Sunday with a 2.7% increase after reports emerged from Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal about the White House’s narrowed tariff strategy.

The cryptocurrency’s resilience pushed it above $86,700 by Sunday midnight.

This represents a 3.3% gain for the day.

The broader crypto market followed suit with a 0.7% increase in total market cap, according to data from CoinGecko.

President Trump previously declared April 2 as “Liberation Day,” when he planned to impose sweeping tariffs across many economic sectors.

The administration now appears to be taking a more measured approach.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated last week that tariffs would apply to “about 15% of nations with persistent trade imbalances with the U.S.”

This more focused strategy has helped ease market concerns about widespread economic impacts.

Trump Signals Flexibility

During Oval Office remarks, Trump hinted at some flexibility in his approach. 

“I don’t change. But the word flexibility is an important word,” Trump said. 

“Sometimes it’s flexibility. So there’ll be flexibility, but basically it’s reciprocal.”

The president specifically mentioned China in his comments.

He suggested there would be room for “talk” on trade issues with the country and expressed hope to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping soon.

Global stock markets also responded positively to the news.

Europe’s Stoxx 600 index opened 0.5% higher on Monday, with gains led by tariff-sensitive sectors like commodity producers and automakers.

S&P 500 futures added 0.9%, breaking a four-week streak of losses.

This positive movement came as markets had been on edge ahead of Trump’s April 2 deadline.

Daniel Murray, chief executive officer of EFG Asset Management in Zurich, explained the market reaction: “Markets have taken some comfort from news that the next stage of the Trump administration’s tariff regime will involve targeted tariffs.”

Murray added that “this raises the possibility that some sectors and countries may fare better than others, helping explain market optimism.”</p></b>

                <p>Solana price jumped 7% to $140 with daily trading volumes surging 85-94.9% to $2.56-2.67 billion.

Network adoption reached an all-time high with over 11.09 million addresses holding SOL.

The renewed investor interest in Solana coincides with record-breaking network adoption.

On-chain data shows that the Solana network now has more than 11.09 million addresses holding the SOL token, marking an all-time high in user participation within the ecosystem.

Market Analysis

Technical analysis suggests Solana has achieved an important breakthrough.

The cryptocurrency has broken past the crucial resistance level of $137, potentially ending a persistent downtrend that began after the January 20th highs.

This technical breakout has sparked optimism among market analysts.

Crypto Curb, a popular analyst, suggests this move signals the start of new upward momentum for SOL, with forecasts pointing to a potential rally toward $420 in the near future.

Another analyst, Satoshi Flipper, identified a symmetrical triangle pattern on Solana’s 4-hour chart.

This pattern typically signals a continuation of the previous trend once price breaks out of the formation.

The technical outlook remains positive as SOL extends its gains to trade above $138.

Further support for this upward movement comes from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which showed a bullish crossover last week.

Recent reports indicate that the White House is narrowing its approach to tariffs set to take effect on April 2.

The plans likely omit a set of industry-specific tariffs while applying reciprocal levies on a targeted set of nations that account for the bulk of foreign trade with the US.

Adding to the Solana ecosystem narrative, co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko recently expressed skepticism about the necessity of Layer 2 scaling solutions.

Yakovenko argued that Layer 1 blockchains can deliver superior performance with greater speed, lower costs, and enhanced security compared to Layer 2 alternatives.</p></b>

                <p>Bitcoin trading at $87,127 as of Monday, March 24, 2025.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency has been experiencing high volatility in recent weeks. Price swings saw Bitcoin drop below $80,000 before rebounding to current levels around $87,000.

Rather than imposing broad industry-wide tariffs, the Trump administration is expected to target specific countries with major trade imbalances with the United States.

This group, reportedly dubbed the “dirty 15,” could include major economies such as China, Japan, India, and Vietnam.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that countries might be able to negotiate to avoid higher tariffs. Nations could potentially reduce their own trade barriers as a way to avoid new U.S. tariffs.

The more targeted approach to tariffs has helped ease market concerns about trade tensions. This has led to increased confidence in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin’s recent price movement comes alongside a major accumulation phase. Over 172,705 BTC have been acquired since February 23, indicating growing demand in the market.

This increase in demand mirrors similar activity seen after the FTX collapse. That period marked the bottom of the market before a recovery phase began.

Network data also shows encouraging signs of growth. Active Bitcoin addresses have risen by 0.96%, reaching a total of 8.7151 million users.

Transaction counts have surged by 1.66%, totaling nearly 500,000 transactions. These metrics highlight strong user engagement and reflect interest from both retail and institutional investors.

Institutional investors continue to fuel Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have recorded six consecutive days of inflows, showing renewed demand from larger investors.

Japanese Bitcoin investment firm Metaplanet Inc has been increasing its holdings. The company currently holds over 3,200 BTC and plans to grow its reserves to 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025.

Arthur Hayes predicts Bitcoin could reach $110,000 before retesting the $76,500 mark.

Hayes bases his optimism on expectations that the Federal Reserve will shift from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing. This change could inject more liquidity into risk assets like Bitcoin.

Market attention will focus on the Federal Reserve’s core PCE price index, the central bank’s preferred inflation gauge. Analysts expect a slight uptick from 2.6% to 2.7%, which could influence market sentiment for Bitcoin and other digital assets.

With technical indicators pointing to a potential breakout and fundamental metrics showing strength, Bitcoin appears to be entering a new phase of growth. The combination of institutional interest and improving network metrics suggests the rally may have room to continue.</p></b>

                <p>US Treasury removed Tornado Cash from sanctions list on March 21, 2025.

The move came after a November 2024 federal appeals court ruling that found the Treasury had exceeded its authority.

Tornado Cash was sanctioned in August 2022 for allegedly laundering over $7.6 billion in crypto assets.


Regulators claimed it helped process more than $7.6 billion worth of virtual assets since its creation in 2019.

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) placed Tornado Cash on its Specially Designated Nationals list, along with over 100 Ethereum wallet addresses associated with the platform.


The November 2024 court decision stated that OFAC “overstepped its congressionally defined authority.”

The ruling centered on the fact that Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts cannot be considered “property” under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.


Following the delisting, the Treasury Department argued the case should be considered resolved.

They stated in court documents that because Tornado Cash had been removed from the sanctions list, the lawsuit was now “moot.”

The Treasury further claimed the court should assess whether it still has jurisdiction.

Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal strongly disagrees with this approach.


In a March 24 post on X, he criticized the Treasury’s attempt to avoid a final court judgment.

Grewal argued that this is a textbook example of “voluntary cessation.”

For voluntary cessation to apply, there must be clear assurance that the behavior will not happen again.


He pointed out that the Treasury has provided no such guarantee.

The legal challenges began in September 2022, with six Tornado Cash users suing the Treasury to reverse the sanctions.


Crypto policy advocacy group Coin Center filed a similar lawsuit in October 2022.</p></b>

                <p>Tokyo-based Metaplanet has increased its Bitcoin holdings to 3,350 BTC (valued at $291 million) after purchasing an additional 150 BTC.

Metaplanet’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, stated that Eric Trump, son of U.S. President Donald Trump, has joined Metaplanet’s new strategic advisory board.


The company has used stock acquisition rights and zero-coupon bonds to finance its Bitcoin acquisitions. This approach has allowed the company to buy Bitcoin without taking on interest-bearing debt.

In March alone, the company redeemed ¥2 billion ($12.8 million) in bonds ahead of schedule. It then raised another ¥2 billion through a new bond issuance to continue its Bitcoin buying strategy.


Metaplanet tracks its Bitcoin strategy using a metric called BTC Yield. This calculates the percentage increase in Bitcoin holdings compared to fully diluted shares over time.

The company’s BTC Yield was 41.7% from July to September 2024. It then jumped to 309.8% from October to December 2024 as Bitcoin prices soared.


For the first quarter of 2025 (January 1 to March 24), Metaplanet has achieved a BTC Yield of 68.3%. This shows continued growth in its Bitcoin holdings relative to shares.

Since Metaplanet began accumulating Bitcoin in April 2024, its stock price has risen by over 3,000%.</p></b>

                <p>Dogecoin is approaching a critical breakout point with strong support at $0.139-$0.17.

Analyst Kevin indicates that DOGE needs to maintain above $0.139 for bullish momentum, as it received a "weekly demand candle" at this level.

The cryptocurrency has formed a falling wedge pattern since its January peak of $0.435, suggesting a potential breakout is near.

Several technical indicators are resetting, which could signal diminishing downward pressure and precede price recoveries.

Analyst Carl Moon predicts a significant upside if DOGE breaks out of its current pattern, with a target of $0.434, nearly matching its previous high from earlier this year.


Following such a breakout, Moon projects a 157% rally to reach approximately $0.434.

Strong support for Dogecoin is identified between $0.16 and $0.17, which has prevented further downside movement and could serve as a launching pad for higher prices.

Whalesdesk outlined a more ambitious price target, suggesting DOGE could reach a four-year high of $0.60.


On-chain data shows growing whale activity supporting the bullish outlook, with large holders accumulating DOGE at current price levels.


The Dogecoin network has seen increased user engagement in recent weeks, with daily active addresses growing and transaction volumes increasing.

Transaction activity often reflects growing demand for a cryptocurrency and can support price trends.

Dogecoin developers continue working on network improvements to enhance transaction speed and reduce fees.


The recent price action shows DOGE finding a low at $0.1646 before attempting a recovery, moving above both the $0.1680 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average.


A bullish trend line has formed with support at $0.1680 on the hourly chart, which could provide a foundation for further gains toward the $0.1755 and $0.18 resistance levels.

If Dogecoin fails to break above $0.1755, it could face another decline, with next support levels at $0.172, $0.168, and the critical $0.165 area.


The overall market has experienced some fluctuations following Federal Reserve policy decisions, influencing investor sentiment across digital assets, including Dogecoin.

Kevin tied DOGE's prospects to Bitcoin's performance, noting that if Bitcoin holds above $70,000, the outlook for Dogecoin remains positive.

This highlights the connection between Bitcoin's movements and the broader altcoin market.</p></b>

                <p>Pi Network price has dropped below $1, down 6.3% to around $0.94.

The upcoming token unlocks of 97.65 million Pi over 30 days could add more selling pressure.

Expert suggests burning 60-100 million Pi coins to help stabilize the price.


Technical indicators show a potential bullish breakout with a falling wedge pattern forming.

Pi Network faces challenges with major exchange listings due to transparency concerns.


Market watchers point to several factors behind the recent price weakness. The lack of confirmation about a potential Binance listing has disappointed many investors who had hoped for wider exchange support. The absence of major announcements from the Pi Core Team has also hurt market sentiment.


A major concern for Pi holders is the upcoming token unlocks. Data shows that nearly 97.65 million Pi tokens worth approximately $93 million at current prices will be released into circulation over the next 30 days.


The daily average unlock rate stands at 3.25 million tokens.

April 3rd will see the largest single-day unlock with 6.8 million Pi coins entering the market.


PiScan data reveals that 115.57 million tokens will be unlocked in April, followed by 182 million in May and 222 million in June.


These massive unlocks could put more downward pressure on Pi Network’s price.


Crypto expert Dr. Altcoin believes there might be a solution to this problem.


Dr. Altcoin suggested on X (formerly Twitter) that the Pi Core Team should consider burning between 60-100 million Pi coins in the coming days.


This reduction in supply could help offset the impact of newly unlocked tokens and potentially drive the price back to the $1 mark.


The total circulating supply of Pi currency was recently reduced to 6.77 billion following the removal of 10 million coins.


Technical analysis provides some hope for Pi investors. The cryptocurrency has formed a falling wedge pattern, which often signals a bullish reversal.


Both the MACD indicator and the Percentage Price Oscillator show bullish divergence, suggesting that upward momentum may be building.


If these technical signals prove accurate, Pi Network price could experience a strong breakout in the near future.

Pi Network’s challenges extend beyond price action. Transparency issues around the project’s tokenomics have made major exchanges hesitant to list the coin.


Concerns about the locking and burning mechanism of billions of Pi tokens have led to regulatory questions.

Pi Network recently announced a collaboration with PiDaoSwap aimed at enhancing transparency and governance within the ecosystem.</p></b>

                <p>Strategy has purchased an additional $584 million worth of bitcoin, increasing its total holdings to over half a million BTC.

The company acquired 6,911 bitcoin between March 17-23 at an average price of $84,529 per coin.

This brings Strategy's bitcoin reserves to 506,137 BTC purchased at a cost of $33.7 billion.

Strategy has been aggressively accumulating bitcoin since 2020 under the direction of CEO Michael Saylor.

The company views bitcoin as a long-term store of value to hedge against inflation and global uncertainty.

Funds for this latest purchase came from Strategy's sale of 1.975 million shares of common stock, raising approximately $592 million.

With its focus on bitcoin, Strategy has become a leading corporate example of allocating treasury reserves to the cryptocurrency.

Other public companies have followed similar strategies, including Metaplanet and Semler Scientific.

Strategy aims to maximize long-term shareholder value by staking its future on bitcoin's network effects and adoption as 'digital gold'.

The company's stock price has skyrocketed since its first BTC purchase.</p></b>

The company acquired 6,911 bitcoin between March 17-23 at an average price of $84,529 per coin. This purchase brings Strategy's bitcoin reserves up from its previous total.

Funds for this latest bitcoin purchase came from the sale of 1.975 million shares of common stock, raising approximately $592 million through the STRK ATM.


Strategy has been aggressively accumulating bitcoin since 2020 under the direction of CEO Michael Saylor. The company views bitcoin as a long-term store of value to hedge against inflation and global uncertainty.

With its laser focus on bitcoin, Strategy has become a leading corporate example of allocating treasury reserves to bitcoin. Other public companies have followed a similar game plan on a smaller scale.


Strategy aims to maximize long-term shareholder value by staking its future on bitcoin's network effects and adoption as 'digital gold'. The company's stock price has skyrocketed since its first BTC purchase.

With bitcoin gaining credibility among institutions, companies, and even nations, Strategy remains confident in its bitcoin-centric strategy.</p></b>

                <p>Bitcoin regained momentum Sunday, increasing by as much as 2.7% following reports of a targeted approach to April 2 tariffs.

The White House has signaled it would likely omit sector-specific duties while still implementing "reciprocal tariffs" on major trading partners.


Reports from Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal stated Trump's administration is narrowing its tariff strategy, leading to higher gains in the crypto market. Bitcoin traded above $86,700 by Sunday midnight, roughly twelve hours after the reports emerged.

The alpha crypto is up 3.3% on the day, while the rest of the market has tracked up by 0.7% in total market cap.


This shift from a broader tariff implementation to a more targeted approach has eased concerns about immediate economic disruption. Previous market fears had centered on Trump's declaration of April 2 as "Liberation Day," when he planned to impose sweeping tariffs across multiple sectors.

Citing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's pronouncements last week, the WSJ reported that the administration is looking to have tariffs applied to "about 15% of nations with persistent trade imbalances with the U.S."


A study from Bloomberg shows that President Trump's implemented or threatened tariffs have affected at least $1.8 trillion in global trade, imposing 25% duties on worldwide steel and aluminum, 25% on non-compliant USMCA goods, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports.

An additional 25% tariffs on E.U. goods was also proposed.</p></b>

                <p>Peter Schiff didn't want gifts for his 62nd birthday yesterday.

Instead, he wants Bitcoin for his new Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, which he has finally managed to transfer from an exchange into a hardware wallet, according to a post on X.

Schiff launched his reserve as a tongue-in-cheek jab at the U.S. government's plans to introduce one.

So far, Schiff's reserve has accumulated over $4,500, mostly from small donations.

Despite his long history of bitcoin skepticism, he insists he's in it for the long haul.

Schiff has been one of the loudest critics of the Trump administration's plans for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

He advocates for strengthening existing reserves in gold — Schiff really loves gold — or petroleum.

Schiff branded the recent White House crypto summit a "disgrace" and "national embarrassment."

Last week, he claimed that the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve initiative was nothing more than a way for the crypto industry to lure more Americans into speculative losses.</p></b>

                <p>President Donald Trump endorsed the Official Trump (TRUMP) token on social media Sunday morning, directly promoting the Solana-based meme coin.

The President's affiliated companies hold an 80% ownership stake in the token.

"I LOVE $TRUMP—SO COOL!!! The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Trump posted on TruthSocial at 10:33 AM ET.

CoinGecko data shows that the asset is up 7.7% on the day to $11.67, but remains down 84% from its all-time high.

Luis Buenaventura, head of crypto at GCash, said this price action is a sign that the market is no longer excited about the Trump token.

Despite potential small profits in short timescales, investors are aware of the token's risks.

The token's website claims it is "not intended to be an investment opportunity."

Its value proposition appears linked to Trump's personal brand and ongoing promotion.

Andrew Rossow, digital media attorney and CEO of AR Media, said these activities have set a dangerous precedent for leveraging public office for personal financial gain.

Rossow cites three high-risk constitutional concerns related to the Emoluments Clauses, Separation of Powers, and Equal Protection and Due Process.

The TRUMP token's ownership structure allows foreign actors to purchase tokens anonymously, potentially violating the Emoluments Clauses.

Trump's endorsement undermines regulatory agencies such as the SEC and CFTC, eroding trust in impartial governance.

Rossow argues that preferential treatment for the tokens over others could create an uneven playing field in the crypto market.

Representatives for President Trump did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.</p></b>

                <p>Tabit Insurance, a Barbados-regulated insurance company, raised a $40 million reserve composed entirely of bitcoin to write traditional insurance and reinsurance business.

The insurer emerged in January and plans to offer bitcoin-backed liability policies for company directors and officers (D&O).

The firm has a class 2 insurance license from the Barbados Financial Services Commission, making it the first regulated risk carrier to rely on bitcoin-only reserves to write traditional policies priced in U.S. dollars.

Tabit co-founder and CEO Stephen Stonberg said bitcoin holders are invited to contribute assets to the firm's system of segregated reserve cells to earn yields of around 10%.

A good analogy from the world of insurance is the way accredited investors, known as "Names," deploy assets into insurance syndicates at the Lloyd's of London insurance market.

Stonberg stated that for a technology like crypto, you may need a new underwriter, but the way the insurance is done is fundamentally the same as before.

"We are holding our regulatory capital in bitcoin, and I think bringing in a new capital source to the insurance industry and innovating with the balance sheet is an opportunity that other people weren't really looking at," Stonberg said.</p></b>

                <p>Donald Trump's official memecoin, TRUMP, was the best-performing digital asset on Monday during Asian hours, according to CoinGecko data.

The token rose from around $10.93 to approximately $12.25 in the minutes after Trump posted on Truth Social calling it "the greatest of them all" and "cool." 

After a brief sell-off, the TRUMP token is trading at $11.91, or up around 9%.

According to CoinGecko, this makes it the best-performing crypto of the Asia trading day.

Ethena is up 8.9%, Bonk is up 8%, and Mantle is up 7% .

The CoinDesk 20, a measure of the performance of the largest digital assets, is up around 2%.

House Democrats have introduced the MEME Act to prohibit federal officials and their families from profiting off meme coins.

The legislation aims to curb officials' involvement in such meme coins through proposed regulations.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has said that memecoins – like the TRUMP token – are not securities thus not subject to its oversight.</p></b>

                <p>World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project backed by President Donald Trump's family, has acquired substantial amounts of Mantle's MNT token.

WLFI purchased about 3.54 million MNT for nearly $3 million USDC for an average purchase price of 84 cents, according to data sources Lookonchain and Arkham Intelligence.

The recent purchase has increased WLFI's coin holdings, which include tokens like ETH, WBTC, TRX, LINK, AAVE, ENA, and others, to over $340 million. However, the Trump family-backed outlet still faced a paper loss of $111 million as of writing.

MNT is the native cryptocurrency of the Mantle Network, serving as a utility token for gas fees and a governance token for the layer 2 ecosystem focused on scaling Ethereum.

The Mantle Mainnet hard fork, or backwards-incompatible upgrade, took effect on March 19, activating EigenDA on the network. EigenDA is a secure, high-throughput, decentralized data availability service on Ethereum.

The EigenDA integration is said to boost Mantle Network's scalability without hitting data rate limits, reportedly resulting in a 15 MB/s throughput. In other words, the network can process more transactions per block.

Additionally, the upgrade has made the Mantle Network better compatible with Ethereum's impending Pectra upgrade.</p></b>

                <p>Tabit Insurance, a Barbados-regulated insurance company established by former executives from Bittrex, has raised a $40 million reserve composed entirely of bitcoin to write traditional insurance and reinsurance business.

The insurer emerged in January this year with plans to offer bitcoin-backed liability policies for company directors and officers (D&O) and claims to be the first regulated risk carrier to rely on bitcoin-only reserves to write traditional policies priced in U.S. dollars.

The firm has a class 2 insurance license from the Barbados Financial Services Commission.

Tabit co-founder and CEO Stephen Stonberg said bitcoin holders are invited to contribute assets to the firm’s system of segregated reserve cells, which is managed using non-custodial tech from Fireblocks, to earn yields of around 10%.

Stonberg compared Tabit's approach to how accredited investors deploy assets into insurance syndicates at the Lloyd’s of London insurance market.</p></b>

                <p>World Liberty Financial (WLFI) has acquired 3.54 million MNT tokens following Mantle Network's major technological upgrade.

The purchase was made at an average price of 84 cents, with WLFI spending nearly $3 million USDC on the tokens.

The Trump family-backed outlet now holds over $340 million in coins, including ETH, WBTC, TRX, LINK, AAVE, ENA, and others.

However, despite this increase in holdings, WLFI still faces a paper loss of $111 million.

MNT is the native cryptocurrency of the Mantle Network, used for gas fees and governance within the layer 2 ecosystem focused on scaling Ethereum.


The Mantle Mainnet hard fork took effect on March 19, activating EigenDA, a secure, high-throughput decentralized data availability service on Ethereum.

EigenDA aims to boost scalability without hitting data rate limits, resulting in a 15 MB/s throughput, and improve compatibility with upcoming upgrades.</p></b>

                <p>While Friday’s SEC Crypto Task Force Roundtable was a refreshing change from the prior administration’s “regulation by enforcement” approach, it focused on yesterday’s problems instead of proposals that could shape the regulatory framework that will govern crypto going forward.

Since 1946, the question of whether a product is a “security” or “commodity” has been governed by the Supreme Court’s decision in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. Courts have struggled to uniformly apply the “Howey” test to digital assets, which should not be surprising because it’s a decades-old decision about citrus groves.

Digital assets do not cleanly fit into either the “security” or “commodity” bucket. They are something entirely new. But the distinction between securities and commodities matters under the law because the SEC regulates securities and the CFTC regulates products that include commodities.

Congress is considering new legislation that resembles last year’s FIT21 bill. That legislation will move past the outmoded Howey test and sharply define how particular digital assets are classified.

Friday’s roundtable, which included a dozen or so prominent crypto lawyers alongside members of the SEC’s crypto taskforce, should have served as a jumping off point for ideas and proposals that the SEC could use as input to legislators considering the new legislative framework for crypto.</p></b>

                <p>Bitcoin topped $87,000 early Monday with solana (SOL), xrp (XRP) and dogecoin (DOGE) adding more than 4% to start the week in the green.

A risk-off mood persists, but is weakened amid reports suggesting that the U.S. tariffs due April 2 might be more measured than initially expected.


Investors are remaining cautious on the upcoming price moment due to the uncertainty,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, said in a Telegram message. “This week's U.S. economic reports on consumer confidence, personal spending, and PCE may show whether American consumers can cope with these economic changes or are preparing for less spending and more budgeting.


Consumer confidence measures how optimistic Americans are about the economy — high confidence means more spending, low means more saving. Personal spending tracks how much people buy, which is a big driver of economic growth. PCE, or Personal Consumption Expenditures, is a key inflation gauge, showing price changes in goods and services.


Some traders, however, say the U.S. economy is stronger than thought, making current price levels a good area to buy for those bullish in the medium to long term.


“U.S. 'hard' economic data remains robust and in contrast with the soft sentiment, suggesting an over-extrapolation of the current weakness versus underlying fundamentals,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in an email. “Macro observers have generally been more precarious in their assessments than the actual reality, and we believe that the underlying economy remains stronger han feared.


Crypto markets had a similar quiet week, with prices largely rangebound and rebounding off recent lows as a mirror move of the equity action.</p></b>

                <p>U.S. exchange-traded funds tied to ether (ETH) have seen $401 million in net outflows so far in March.

The redemptions represent nearly 6% of the total $6.77 billion in assets held by spot ether ETFs, according to data from SoSoValue.

Just one day this month—March 4—saw positive inflows, with $14.58 million added.

In comparison, January and February saw inflows of $101 million and $60 million, respectively.

Spot bitcoin ETFs also faced withdrawals, with $893 million in net outflows this month, but the scale relative to assets under management was far less severe.

Bitcoin funds remain net positive for the year after strong inflows of $5.25 billion in January.

The contrast mirrors recent market performance: ether has dropped roughly 8.5% since March 1, while bitcoin has gained more than 3%.

Year-to-date, ether has plunged over 37% to around $2,080. Bitcoin, while also down, has fared better with a 7.5% decline to about $87,300.

The broader CoinDesk 20 Index fell 21% in the same period.

Despite the downturn, ether ETFs still hold a net inflow of $2.42 billion since their launch.</p></b>

                <p>DYDX, the token of decentralized derivatives exchange dYdX, jumped nearly 7% to $0.72 after the platform introduced a buyback program.

The platform is dedicating 25% of its monthly protocol fees to purchasing tokens on the open market as part of a broader effort to reinforce the token’s role in the network’s security and economic model amid a prolonged downtrend for DYDX, which has lost more than 78% of its value in the last 12 months.

The buybacks mark a shift in how dYdX allocates its protocol revenue, with 40% going to stakers, 25% to the new program, 25% to its market-supporting MegaVault and 10% toward treasury initiatives.

The exchange reported $46 million in net protocol revenue in 2024 from over $270 billion in trading volume. Governance discussions are already exploring the possibility of increasing the buyback share to as much as 100% of protocol fees.

Tokens bought as part of the program are set to be staked for “an extended period of time to improve network security,” a dYdX representative told CoinDesk. The token's supply dynamics are also shifting, with emissions set to drop by half starting in June.

Most DYDX tokens have already been unlocked, with the remainder scheduled to vest by mid-2026. A pending proposal may also remove unbridged Ethereum-based DYDX tokens from circulation if not transferred to the dYdX layer 1 by June.</p></b>

The firm emerged as a prolific crypto industry investor in 2023, with much of its investments involving buying several million dollars' worth of a project's native token. The approach, which differs from the traditional venture capital model of investing in return for equity, drew some criticism from commentators.

DWF Labs' position as a market maker meant they kept their tokens on exchanges, indicating a risk they could sell them at any time. Managing partner Andrei Grachev told CoinDesk in May 2023 that the firm kept most of its funds and investments on centralized exchanges and that transferring tokens to an exchange does not indicate the company will sell.</p></b>

                <p>Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase, criticized the U.S. Treasury's recent filing.

The Treasury Department's sanctions watchdog removed Tornado Cash from its global blacklist while also removing over 100 ether (ETH) addresses from the Specially Designated Nationals list.

The platform was backlisted in 2022 for its alleged role in laundering $445 million stolen by the North Korea-linked Lazarus cybercrime group.

The Treasury then argued that the action of delisting Tornado Cash resolved the issue at hand and that a final court ruling ordering it to remove the crypto mixer from its sanctions list was no longer necessary, according to a court filing dated March 21.

Grewal said the Treasury's attempts to have the case declared moot is an attempt to sidestep a ruling from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that will leave the door open for a renewed blacklisting and sanctions.

"After grudgingly delisting TC, they now claim they've mooted any need for a final court judgment. But that's not the law, and they know it," Grewal said on X. "Under the voluntary cessation exception, a defendant's decision to end a challenged practice moots a case only if the defendant can show that the practice cannot 'reasonably be expected to recur.'"

Coinbase funded the court case that made its way to the appeals court, Van Loon vs. Treasury.

Grewal cited the example of the FBI v. Fikre case, in which the government removed Yonas Fikre, a U.S. citizen and Sudanese emigree, from the No Fly List, and argued in court that this action rendered Fikre's lawsuit moot.

But, the Ninth Circuit reversed that decision saying that the party seeking to moot a case based on its own voluntary cessation of challenged conduct must show that the conduct cannot “reasonably be expected to recur.”</p></b>

                <p>Standard Chartered, led by Geoff Kendrick, argues that investors should see Bitcoin as a technological asset rather than a digital version of gold.

Led by Geoff Kendrick, Stanchart's team said that Bitcoin's correlation with Nasdaq has been "almost always" stronger than with gold, the traditional refuge. 

While BTC can play a role as a refuge in cases of financial instability, such as the regional banking crisis of 2023 or the possible unsustainable trajectory of US debt, according to the report, the reality is that such coverage is rarely needed.

"Investors can consider BTC as coverage against traditional finances and as part of their technological assignment," Kendrick said. 

Playing with the idea of ​​Bitcoin as part of a technological portfolio, the report proposed a remodeling of the index of the Magnificent 7 calls (MAG 7): The technology companies of great capitalization that have promoted the general profitability of the market in recent times: Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta and Tesla.

This new "Mag 7B" would replace Tesla with Bitcoin. 

The result? MAG7B generated risk-adjusted profitability consistently higher than the original group during the last seven years.

"BTC should be considered as a cryptocurrency with multiple functions in investor portfolios," Kendrick said.</p></b>

                <p>Bitcoin (BTC) exceeded $87,000 on early Monday.

The crypto markets had a similarly quiet week, with prices maintained in a wide range and bouncing from recent minimums.

Technically, prices maintain a negative bearish trend, but are stabilized around key support levels, with ETH establishing themselves at the maximum of the 2022 range and the next important level of support around 1500 points.

Inflation and economic concerns limited Bitcoin's price over the weekend, which was around $85,000.

Sol led the profits between the main cryptocurrencies with an increase of 5% in the last 24 hours.

Trx de Tron led the losses, falling 4% to further reduce the profits after an increase in price driven by Memecoin last week.

Nick Ruck, director of LVRG Research, said that investors remain cautious about the next moment of prices due to uncertainty.

This week's American economic reports on consumer confidence, personal spending and PCE could show if US consumers can face these economic changes or if they are preparing for lower expense and greater budgetary control.

Consumer confidence measures the optimism of Americans with respect to the economy: a high level of trust means greater expense, while a low level means greater savings.

Personal expense measures how much people buy, which is an important driver of economic growth.

The PCE, or personal consumption expense, is a key indicator of inflation that shows price variations in goods and services.

These reports can affect crypto markets. Solid confidence and consumer spending suggest a healthy economy, which could boost cryptocurrency prices as people invest more in higher risk assets.

A high PCE (growing inflation) could worry investors, promoting them to crypto as coverage against a weaker dollar.

However, if trust decreases and spending is slowed, it could indicate a recession, generating caution in investors and dragging cryptocurrency prices down.

Some merchants say that the US economy is stronger than you think, which makes current price levels a good purchase zone for those optimists in the medium and long term.

The crypto market's behavior reflects the actions' behavior, with prices maintained in a wide range and bouncing from recent minimums.</p></b>

                <p>Led by Geoff Kendrick, the StanChart team said bitcoin's correlation with the Nasdaq has "almost always" been stronger than with gold, the old-school safe haven asset.

While BTC may have a role as a place to hide in instances of financial instability like the 2023 regional banking crisis or what might be the unsustainable U.S. debt trajectory, the report said, the reality is that there's rarely a need for such hedges, thus its increasing behavior as more like a traditional tech stock.

"Investors can view BTC as both a hedge against traditional finance and as part of their tech allocation," said Kendrick.

But, at least "in the short term, BTC may be better viewed as a tech stock than as a hedge against TradFi issues," he added.

Playing with the idea of bitcoin as part of a tech portfolio, the report proposed a remodel of the index of the so-called Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) stocks — the mega-cap tech names that have driven overall market returns of late, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta and Tesla (TSLA).

This new "Mag 7B" would swap out Tesla for bitcoin.

The result? The Mag7B produced consistently higher risk-adjusted returns than the original group over the past seven years, reinforcing BTC's role in a tech-focused portfolio, said Kendrick.

The Mag7B outperformed the Mag7 on average by around 1% with nearly 2% lower volatility on an annual basis, a key benefit to institutional investors and large asset allocators, he continued.

"BTC should be seen as serving multiple purposes in investor portfolios.

This would open up the possibility of even more institutional buying," Kendrick noted.

Asset managers have been advocating for including bitcoin in investment portfolios for diversification purposes.</p></b>
