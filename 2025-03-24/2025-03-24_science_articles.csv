From 2009 to 2019, the average rate of avoidable deaths rose by 33 per 100,000 people across the country, researchers report March 24 in JAMA Internal Medicine. Meanwhile, other countries trended down: Members of the European Union experienced an average decrease of 24 per 100,000 over the same time period. And countries that are part of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development — which come from North America, South America, Europe and Asia — reported an average decrease of 19 per 100,000.

The rise in avoidable deaths in the United States has occurred despite the fact that the country spends more on health care than any other high-income nation, the researchers write.

Avoidable mortality is a metric for how well health systems are working. It adds up the annual number of deaths among those under 75 years old that, with timely health care, wouldn’t have happened. The average number of avoidable deaths across all U.S. states in 2019 was roughly 280 per 100,000 people.

The umbrella of avoidable mortality includes both preventable and treatable deaths. Preventable deaths — such as those from vaccine-preventable diseases and traffic collisions — are those that may be avoidable through public health prevention measures. Treatable mortality refers to deaths from conditions such as sepsis or appendicitis that may be avoidable with appropriate medical care. Some deaths, including those from heart disease, cervical cancer and tuberculosis, fall into both categories, with a proportion attributed to each.

The research team also assessed the average rate of avoidable deaths for individual U.S. states, which spanned from an increase of 5 per 100,000 people in New York to a jump of 100 per 100,000 people in West Virginia. The study wasn’t designed to account for the specific factors fueling the overall increase in the United States or the differences between states. But the researchers write that state-level public health policies — such as Medicaid expansion, abortion restrictions and gun control measures — have diverged over time.",sciencenews

Transcript

Laura Sanders: This podcast deals with mental illness, depression and suicide. Please listen with care.

Hi listeners, we’re dropping into your feeds this week with a special bonus episode of The Deep End. Over the last six episodes, you’ve heard about some of the hardest parts of Jon Nelson’s life. And some of the best parts too. He’s struggled through severe depression. He volunteered for an experimental treatment that involved brain implants, and now he’s relearning how to live. For this bonus episode, we’re going to check in with Jon and see how he’s doing these days. You’ll hear more from him about what it was like to go through severe depression, and what it’s like now that he’s out from under it, now that he’s living what he calls his bonus life. Welcome to The Deep End. I’m Laura Sanders.

I called Jon in December of 2024, over two years out from his surgery. Here are parts of our conversation, including the part where he tells me that he’s become friends with another person you might remember from the podcast, Amanda, the artist in New York City who had DBS surgery, too. Take a listen.

Sanders: Hi, Jon.

Jon: How is life? How you doing?

Sanders: Good. I’m doing really well. How about you?

Jon: I am too. I, a lot of, lot of stuff going on. My one colleagues says, a lot of momentum. I’ll take momentum. Momentum is a good term.

Sanders: Oh my, yes. Thank you for talking to me again. Are you tired of me yet?

Jon: No, man, I’m, I’m all in, all the time. Your family OK? You guys doing OK?

Sanders: Yeah, we’re all good. We’re in the Christmas, you know, mayhem crash landing into the new year. How about you?

Jon: It’s like, I just like Thanksgiving so much more, so less pressure, you know what I mean? It’s like, the planning for a month for five minutes of opening gifts to like the crash, you know. Holidays are hard. I’m one of those where they’re hard for me, so it’s, they’re less hard than they used to be, but still not like my favorite time of year.

I’ve become super close friends with Amanda, who I saw for that video after mine, and I reached out to Figee, and was like, “Yo, I was like, send my information to her.” And dude, immediately, she reached out and we’ve become, we’ve come tight. I may have told you this, but I, she ended up sending me her artwork. I was like, “Dude, can I get some of your artwork?” And, she sent me the high-res PDFs so I have it in like all my kids’ bedrooms.

Sponsor Message

Sanders: That’s awesome. Which ones do you have in there?

Jon: The subway one is like my favorite, so that’s in my musicians, kids’ room and one of them with the heart, it’s Amanda with the heart, is in my other kid’s room, and the third one is blanking me right now, but, dude, they’re just beautiful, like every one I see, and then she did, did you know she did a DBS book? Like how incredible is that? Like, it’s just so neat, you know, that just. I love creativity. I love people with passion and creativity, and you can’t beat that with her.

Sanders: Yeah, yeah. I mean, she, she sent that book and we used a few of the drawings to illustrate the, the new, the online version of this story, and it just like got me. You know, you can describe it in words and you can even hear her talking about it, but then seeing the way she kind of puts these colors together and like, designs it all, it’s gorgeous.

Jon: We do like a monthly support group I started three years ago and, you can just tell, I can tell with every person, like their posture, their skin complexion, their, how animated they are. I know exactly where they are.

Sanders: Yeah. Is it Zoom? You meet on Zoom?

Jon: Yep. It’s actually, well, it’s a Google Meet, but yeah, it’s web conference and it started from my first article that I did about three years ago, actually three years ago now, it was December 2nd, 2021. That’s weird. That was, yeah, three years ago. And that’s, I just had so many people reach out to me that were similar situations, high functioning folks, suffering through hell. And so that was kind of the goal was, you know, kind of a high-functioning mental health support group of people, like-minded folks who are in theory, what people think is hiding it, where we are not hiding it, but we are struggling and it’s been great. Just like sometimes two people join, sometimes 15 people join, you know, it’s just each month is different and it’s been really cool.

Sanders: What kind of things do you talk about?

Jon: So in that support group, it’s check-ins. It’s where, where are you at right now? What’s, what’s changed? What’s, where’s your mind? Situational stuff, you know. Guys, how would you move forward with this? Which, you know, relatability. It’s just all peer-based support and with zero intent or goal other than to be around like-minded people and be able to get as, as, as healthy as we can.

And just, you know, when you’re dealing with a condition like we deal with, you know, being able to be around people who understand the hell and who also understand the stupidity of society for stigmatizing us, it’s a really wonderful thing to feel quote unquote normal for a half a second.

Sanders: Yeah, yeah, it makes a ton of sense. And now, if you don’t mind, I’ll shift into kind of the same question for you, you know, Where, where are you right now? How are you doing?

Jon: So right now, I am just over two years from my surgery date. So I’ve been in remission for two years of this maniacally horrific disease. That does not mean that it is simple. It is easy. It’s the exact opposite of that. I still have to work on it daily. I still have to be, maintain my, you know, try to keep my mood as neutral as it possibly can be. And, you know, one of the main things that I would say is, you know, Dr. Mayberg telling me that I needed to rehab my brain, and I didn’t understand what that meant. And, you know, learning how to deal with sadness and kind of, have that being part of my life is extremely triggering for me still to this day. And I, you know, I went into the surgery, you know, hoping I would die. And, you know, coming out of it not dead, and coming out of it in remission from this disease is like winning the lottery. It wasn’t even something that I thought was plausible. And so to come out of it and be disease free, is, is still earth-shattering to me.

But then I never would have thought that you take it one step further. And I am dealing with trauma. You know, I’m dealing with trauma from living in hell for as long as I did. And being an empath, being a middle child, being an emotional person, which I know is shocking to say as a dude, but that’s what I am. And so to have your emotions completely pulverized and twisted and tortured for a decade, you know, you truly focus in on, on all aspects. And so I have to learn how to live with something that is part of my life for the rest of my life, which is being sad. And so being sad is an absolute normal human emotion. And sadness, anger, happiness, like they all happen and they come into your body and they leave your body. And so, I know that it’s going to leave, but guess what? My analogy would be, you know, an alcoholic who has to, every once in a while, take a very, very large sip of alcohol, of wine. It would be very challenging for them to deal with that. It’s the exact same scenario that I have. I still have to feel sadness. And so it’s actually been very helpful for me too, in trying to explain to people the hell of this disease is we all have to experience human emotions. It’s the cycle of life. The disease of severe depression is, you take that, you take that emotion of general sadness, maybe it’s at a three out of 10, 10 being death. And it’s doubled, it’s tripled, and it never leaves your body. So those bad moments that you have, imagine multiplying them by, you know, two, three, four, five, and it never leaves your body. And the only thing consistent that you have is every day it gets a little worse. That’s what it’s like to deal with severe depression in a treatment-resistant form. And so add that feeling and thought onto an additional flame of society being stupid and judging and blaming and ostracizing millions of people for having this condition that nobody has asked for just like every other disease. That’s why everyone dies. That’s why everybody suffers. And it’s that simple. And so to think that I can go through this and prove to the world that this is a biological disease, I just have a circuit off of my brain. I have 23 million pulses going into my brain, every day. If I do not have that electricity, I go immediately back into this maniacally horrific disease.

And so the fact that society judges, labels, blames, ostracizes me and millions of other people for something that we did not ask for is the reason that healthcare costs for this disease and all the other comorbid conditions exist. It’s because of the stupidity of society for blaming, labeling, judging, ostracizing for a disease that we didn’t ask for. You look at cancer, there is communal love, support, a hug. And that’s exactly how it should be. It’s beautiful. Like, let’s take care of you, your family. We feel sorry for you. The exact opposite is serious mental illness. That’s the problem. That’s why everybody suffers and dies.

Sanders: Yeah, I, I remember you telling me it’s a non-casserole disease, and that really struck me.

Jon: It is a one hundred percent non-casserole disease. Everybody lines up, everybody, everybody goes over to the person’s house who’s suffering from cancer. Meals are coordinated every single day. People are driving folks down for therapy and treatment. It’s beautiful. It’s the best part of humanity, and you could not get a more further from reality situation than serious mental illness, and it’s absolutely appalling to me. It’s unjust and it’s right in everybody’s face on why everybody suffers and dies. And people just continue to do it. So that’s my mission for the rest of my life is to poke society, to let them know that their behavior is absolutely directly responsible for suffering and death.

Sanders: You described your depression as feeling like a poison in your body. Do you feel that poison anymore?

Jon: So my depression, the feeling that I had is, my two biggest symptoms before going into surgery were a constant desire for death, euphoria to die. I wouldn’t, I’d thought about suicidal ideation as much as I was breathing. I mean, it was that pervasive and consistent in my life. And so that’s my mind portion of it. And then my second portion of it was exactly what you said, physically ravaged my body. And so to explain that to you, think about the feeling that you get, the full-body sensation feeling you get when you have a fever, right? You have the aches, you have the shakes, you have the, it’s just pure discomfort, right? Like this is awful. So take that feeling, that same physical overwhelming feeling, and it’s just death and dread, just circulating through my body. Like I could feel it in my fingertips. I could feel it everywhere. And so to wake up from the surgery, and they turn the device on, and both of those are gone, immediately, like gone. It’s still surreal to this day. And so when I think about the before and afters, I, I, there was just so many. I mean, one of them that is just so vivid to me is I got this massive tattoo before my surgery on my left arm. I’ve never gotten a tattoo. I wanted to kind of, you know, do something to, I don’t know if the right word is commemorate, memorialize. I don’t even know what it is. I guess symbolically, you know, represent my fight through this hell. And so I just, a big nature scene on my left arm, and that’s because being out in nature, specifically around trees, you know, reduces symptoms of depression. So I was like, all right, let’s bring it here. I didn’t feel it. You know, they put, they took four days to get this thing on. And I didn’t feel it. It wasn’t pleasant. It wasn’t unpleasant. It was just there. And I had to go back and get it touched up after my surgery, and I had to have her stop multiple times, cause I could feel again in my body. I could actually feel something other than the hell of this horrific disease. And so that’s an absolute perfect example.

Sanders: I wonder if there are any surprises that have come out of all of this. After going through the run-up to the surgery, the surgery itself, kind of this rehab portion. Were there any unexpected changes or anything that happened that surprised you?

Jon: For sure. I think that I very quickly learned that I’m living a bonus life. And it’s a lot of fun living a bonus life, because things that you typically would say, wouldn’t say or you would think, but I don’t know if I should say this or do this, I fully embrace those moments, you know? I fully embrace them, and I say what most people wouldn’t. And that’s mostly positive. That’s some negative, and I enjoy that with my advocacy because I like poking. I like poking because I want you to think differently. And I will tell you the most, like similar, some of these things are kind of taboo, right? Oh, don’t talk about mental illness in the work setting and blah blah blah. I do the opposite. I go straight at it hard. The more, the more raw that I am, the more pokey that I am, the more successful that I have become with my advocacy and with momentum. And there’s not been one thing that I have done in this outside world of being in remission of depression and talking about it and being very open about it and being very raw, being very real, that has been negative in the slightest bit. It’s been nothing but positive.

Sanders: A bonus life. I love that phrase and that thought. Does it show up with your family? Do you feel like you’re living a bonus life with your kids and your wife?

Jon: A hundred percent. I owe everything to them. I owe everything to my wife, you know, she’s just a rock, the most amazing person, you know, the only person that these horrific maniacal diseases are, are, are worse for than the person suffering is the caretaker, caregiver, and that was my wife. And so to be able to see the hell that she went through while watching the person that she loves, who I know I’m a good father, a good provider, a good husband, just deteriorate. And all those things are on her now. And she’s her, her, her bandwidth is zero, and, you know, society is not helping her. Society is judging her too. And it’s horrific. And so to be able to, to be able to see, you know, her in the scenario that we’re in now, which is, we’re out of it, you know, we’re out of it. She’s still cautious. It’s been two years. She’s still cautious. I’m still cautious. I’m always afraid, you know? Use your cancer remission. You know, I’m in remission, but I still gotta get checked and make sure it doesn’t come back, you know? So we always will live with that fear, but yeah, I mean, just, just the the, the standard, the typical embrace. The hugs are different. The watching a show together is different. The being around the kids is different.

You know, my kids, it’s all they knew, right? They knew I’m a good dad. They knew they got to see me healthy dad prior, and they also had to see sick dad, and they knew that it wasn’t me, they knew it was the disease, they truly did, you know, and and I talked to him about it all the time of, “Guys, how did this impact you?” And they’re like, “It’s all we knew. It was our life and it’s great to have you back.”

And so to come out of this on the other side and be able to have just genuinely enjoy your time together and have conversations and be able to throw a football with them again, you know, be able to take my daughter, she’s turning 16, we’re going over Christmas. I’m taking her on a dad-daughter trip to San Francisco and we’re gonna drive down the coast to L.A. Like, do you know how beautiful that is? I mean, I, it’s just stunning that I can do that now and enjoy every single moment, you know? Including the, every single minute in that car ride down and the laughter and the music. I couldn’t do that before. Now I, I can experience joy in a healthy way and enjoy it tremendously, and grow very important relationships in my life.

Sanders: Yeah, yeah, it does seem like just a qualitatively different thing to feel that way versus the absence of something awful. Yeah, yeah. Are you taking your daughter to where you used to live?

Jon: When the kids turned five years old, and my wife and I were like, let’s take them on a trip, like each individually, like mom, dad, kid trip. It’s just a fun age, you know, he turned five and my my middle guy, I’ll give an example, is like, I wanna go to New York City, and so we went to New York City and he’s five years old out on, I still remember Park Avenue and 37th Street, holding his hand up, hailing a cab. You know, we’re doing all the, you know, it’s just was fun, right? It’s like one of those moments where like they really can experience life and understand it and do some cool stuff. And so we just came up with this. My daughter’s turning 16, and so my wife and I are like, let’s do something like that. Like, let’s give them another opportunity. And I happen to be extremely lucky, cause it works out perfectly for me to be able to take her. So we’re just doing a solo trip. And so she could pick anywhere in the world, literally, we’re like, where do you wanna go? What do you wanna do?

And it really makes you realize how nostalgic people are for their origins, and she was born and raised out in San Francisco. She left when she was four, but it’s still part of her identity. And so the fact that she picked going to San Francisco and driving down the coast and stopping at Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay and Carmel and, you know, hitting, hitting L.A. It’s pretty cool, you know? And so that’s, that’s, that’s really what drove it is, you know, I think let’s get back to my, my hometown and let’s smile and see some beauty and make some great memories.

And so, you know, my big thing with my kids is I always try to go to a high level in regards to what am I trying to achieve. And, you know, parenting is, is not easy. It’s, it’s, I always say you want to hug them 10 times a day and punch them 10 times a day, right? There’s, there’s ups and downs and it’s, it’s overall amazing. But, you know, being able to get your kids out of the house, like my focus is always on, you know, if you can have, you know, if you can be a good, independent person and you can be confident, I did my part and, you know, I’m very, very fortunate that, you know, my daughter is right there. And, you know, being able to help guide that and being able to play a part in making that happen is, is really, really fun for me. And that’s what motivates me as a parent.

Sanders: Yeah, that makes perfect sense, seeing them kind of launch in their own lives and, and knowing you did what you needed to do, and now they’re going to go off on their own adventures.

Jon: If you hit those two qualities, all the other ones come. That’s why you gotta start high. Everything else will happen.

Sanders: Shifting a little bit to the research, I wonder if you’re still involved in the research project at all, and if so, what that looks like.

Jon: So here’s a human behavior thing that I find fascinating is we had to do two times a day, we had to commit to a journal, a video journal. We had to do eight minutes of brain scans. Essentially they would analyze my brain waves. We had to do multiple, multiple choice questions on our, on our feelings. We had to do that twice a day, so it was a commitment and, and that was something that was not a problem. Let’s go. Like, this is what I gotta do for this, there’s a lot of, a lot of to do’s. We had to do our part. And at about six months, that turned into once a day. And then a couple of months later, it was once a week. And so I’m at that phase now where it’s, it’s once a week. But, but here’s the challenge. The challenge is, it’s harder to do once per week than it is to do twice a day every day. How wild is that, right? And so that’s my challenge is like, I screw up and don’t make my deadlines a lot. And so it’s, you know, it’s something that’s always in the back of my head. And so the short answer is, is, yeah, I’ll be connected to these guys for an extremely long time, and it’s amazing. At some point I’ll be stopping the kind of video journal and the brain activity, but I still meet with the psychiatrists on a quarterly basis, and it’s more of a check-in. They’re still fully available to me when I email. The humanity that this group has provided me is, is exceptional. And they’re in my corner. You know, at some point I’m gonna need to change. I have the R plus S Medtronic investigational device in my chest. That’s the pacemaker, and they have a new commercial grade of available device that I will have to get into my chest. So they’ll basically cut me open and swap that out. It’s a battery. They say pacemaker, but it’s a battery. That’s how I look at it. So I’ll get the newest and greatest battery in there, and that’s also something that will be included as part of the trial. I know Medtronic has provided those to them as part of this clinical trial.

When you go through severe depression, serious mental illness in this country which is apparently the best country on the planet which I highly, highly, highly contest based off of going through this journey, and then you walk into a clinical trial environment like I did, I can’t begin to tell you the difference, like how absolutely different they are, and how broken our mental health system is in this country. I had physicians looking at me in the eye. I had them telling me that they want to help me, that they know something’s wrong with me, that they believe me, that they can fix me. I’m saved for sure by this medical technology in my brain, a hundred percent. But it’s not just that. It’s definitely that, but it’s also their humanity. It’s their empathy. It’s how they talk to me. It’s how they believe me. That is absolutely part of this, and that’s where it needs to be all the time, especially with a disease, like with the, the diseases within serious mental illness. That’s all we’re dealing with is broken minds. So to be able to help, help a broken mind by being kind, costs no money. Looking at somebody in the eye costs zero money, nothing. You don’t need millions of dollars of consultants to fix this problem. You need to create an environment that can get people into the healthcare system sooner. And you need to get the people who are in there. Guess what? When you’re getting somebody a year into living through hell versus 10 years, again, I have no validation for this, but it’s a pretty logical assumption to think, it’d be a hell of a lot easier to fix that after a year rather than 10 years.

Sanders: Yeah, and it hits home when you talk about kind of the rehab portion of your brain, too. Like if you’re trying to change after a decade of these patterns that you’ve adapted to and learned to live with versus a year of that, that rehab portion’s gonna be a lot easier too.

Jon: Absolutely, one hundred percent. And I, I didn’t understand the significance of the rehab portion, and that’s something for sure that I’ve taken out of this. And my initial thought was, dude, I’m good. I don’t feel this disease all over my body and my mind isn’t warped with constant suicidal ideation. That was naive of me, because I got to understand that it is an absolute journey. I need to continue to put the work in. I need to continue to not get super angry with certain situations before that would make me angry, that would put me right into a recurrence. And so I need to sit back and you know, not let certain situations bug me like they would as much as they typically do, right? I need to be very cognizant of my mood to keep it as neutral as possible to avoid any major ups or major downs.

Sanders: You told me a while back you’re still crabby. You were crabby, you’re still crabby. Do you still feel crabby now?

Jon: You know, irritability was probably the one characteristic that stayed similar. And so my, my joke about it, but it’s probably true, is, you know, I’m just like I guess certain aspects of my life, I’m the cranky old dude, right? Like it just happens throughout life. You’re tired, you’re exhausted, you’re going, being pulled in a million directions and you’re parenting and then things don’t stop. So yes, I do get irritable still, but you know, that’s called being a human being. I’m not anywhere near perfect, but in general, my smiles are back more and I feel, I feel really good. Am I perfect? Nope. This, this, this, this surgery does not, does not cure life problems, but it sure, it sure eliminates and destroys a horrific disease that’s in your body.

Sanders: So when I visited your house, there were some jokes about hiding your charger and changing your settings, and I wonder if you all still joke about things that that are kind of in this realm.

Jon: Yeah, you have to add humility and humor and laughter to all of this. And, you know, yes, a hundred percent. And, you know, a simple way to think of that, my, my wife saying after the first week of me being home, her line to the doctor was, “Is there any chance we can turn the volume down on this a little bit?” Because I’m back. I’m back with a force. And, you know, it’s that, they say that with a big smile on their face. And you know, I, I, I joke around with my, you know, family, my daughter. I’m like, so what is it like when we weren’t here this weekend, you know, myself and my boy, we were at like a hockey tournament, so it’s like, “It’s a lot quieter.” So like, that stuff’s awesome, you know? Like, I mean, it’s just, it’s such a prime example of like what this disease does, this brain disease, that’s what this is, you know. It just mutes you. It, it takes you away from everybody. It takes your core essence away. And so being able to have that back is great. And so my line to them all the time when they’re busting my chops and, and, and having fun with this, which they should, is, you chose me. You chose me. It’s not on me, dude. You picked me, guys. The kids didn’t really. They’re kind of forced in this scenario, but the wife did.

Sanders: She totally did. I love it. Very true. You’ve done so much evocative explaining of what this felt like and what this disease has done to you, how it’s affected you, how it’s affected your family. I wonder if there’s a way to explain to someone who’s not felt this firsthand and may not have a family member or a loved one who’s felt this. What would you say to them, to kind of sum up what this disease is like?

Jon: To those folks who have no understanding of this, I will say a couple things. There’s not many of you. You know, when I start talking about this publicly and speaking, there’s always somebody. Either it’s a friend or a family or them. There is a connection to somebody with lived experience, so they’ve gotten to see firsthand most of the time what this looks like. And for those who haven’t, awesome. I’m so happy that you have not been exposed to it, and it’s the most simplistic thing in the world. The symptoms of this disease, the brain disease of severe depression, the symptoms are a desire to die and a consumption of your body with hell. It’s toxicity burning within your body. That’s the symptom. The symptom of another neurological disease, Parkinson’s, is shaking, right? It’s tremors. You know, look at epilepsy. It’s seizures, right? The symptoms are different, based off of every disease. The fact that society doesn’t understand and questions and judges folks with severe depression is what makes them die, and the unfortunate portion of this is the major symptom of these are torture. And so that’s what we have to understand, is that the people who have this horrific disease didn’t ask for it, at all. And so being able to surround them with love and kindness like you do with every other disease, and let them know that you love them and you care for them, it’s life-saving.

Sanders: If we could shift to kind of the future now, I, I wonder if there’s something you picture for yourself, you know, in, in the next year, in 2035? Where do you want to be? In 2050, where do you want to be? What’s, what’s on your long-term horizon?

Jon: I’ve have a colleague of mine that has been, said something very cool to me that sums up where I am right now with my patient advocacy. I actually call it more activism, because I do wanna poke and I do want to make people feel uncomfortable, so that they can change their behavior, is you have a lot of momentum right now. And I like that I have a lot of momentum. I unfortunately, am not listening to Dr. Helen Mayberg, who after the trial said, “You need to take it easy. You need to not do too much.” Well, I’m not listening to her cause I’m doing a lot, and I’m, but here’s the fun reason why, is, I am extremely motivated. I’m extremely passionate for this. There is a massive, massive, massive problem with a very simple solution, and I’m going to be in your face until the day that I die poking you and letting you know that you’re absolutely wrong and that, you know, we have the most simplistic way that we can possibly fix this, the complete moronic world that we’re in right now, which is simply by showing empathy and being kind to people with mental illness. Then we save, we save lives. We save suffering. Like, let’s go. I’m all about it.

And so when I look at 10 years from now, you know, in the last year, I have been so fortunate to be in the world that I’ve been in. I mean, being a part of your Science News piece, I was able to speak in the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. I was able to participate in a congressional briefing for the neuroscience caucus in April. I’ve been able to, you know, lead multiple academics, physician conventions and sessions. I mean, every opportunity I get, I just smile, and I just say, “Let’s go.” You know, phenomenal opportunity for more exposure, for more places to get the, the message out.

So my long, my aunt always says to make a long story endless, to make a long answer endless, I will, I want to poke and prod and be at the point where people are like, “This dude, this dude, this dude is all in, like, all in.” And so my Pulverize the Stigma initiative I have that I’ve created, this is just my personal brand. I got it tattooed on me, right? Like I am officially all in on this.

Sanders: Before we end, I wanna ask how Barbara is doing, how your kids are doing. What’s the update with everybody?

Jon: Kids are cruising. We got 6th grade, 8th grade, 10th grade, all so different, all so fun to figure out what makes, makes each one of them tick and support those passions and create those, you know, good values that we’re trying to do as a family. And you know, my wife is, she’s just a rock. So my, my world is is hectic and crazy and it’s kind of chess pieces putting around everywhere to make things work, and it’s, and it’s really going well. And so to still have her be this rock of the family, which she is. I mean, it’s not fair, moms and, moms get a lot put on them, you know, for, for the houses and the families. It’s just true. I mean, it’s just the reality, and it’s not right, and we’re doing everything we can to, to, to pull our weight and make a, make a bigger impact on this family, but my God, she is just the strongest person I know. She puts everybody else before her and, you know she’s thriving right now at work. She’s about to start a new job, which is something extremely excited for, at a new great company, and it’s fun to see her smile and laugh. And you know, she had a day home from work yesterday, an unplanned day home from work, and you know, to be able to see her sitting on the couch drinking coffee watching the Today Show, is, it’s like, doesn’t happen. And so to be able to see her kind of being able to relax for a hot second is amazing and I value those moments tremendously.

Sanders: This bonus life.

Jon: Exactly, yeah. And being able to be home, and so her new job actually provides her an extra day off a week, which is, if anybody deserves it, oh my, it’s her. And I’m very excited that she’ll be able to have some alone time in the house without being pulled in a billion different directions. And that to me is happiness.

Sanders: Is there anything else you’d like to add? Anything we haven’t covered that you want to emphasize or highlight for people listening?

Jon: Show empathy and be kind and save lives. It’s not difficult. We’re not anywhere near where we need to be, but just focus on that. Show empathy, acknowledge when people tell you that they’re suffering, that you are sorry. Treat it like any other condition. I’m extremely sorry you’re going through this. You’re loved. And you proactively be kind to them. You don’t ask them what you need. You come home, like I did one day, and my lawn was mowed by my neighbor. I’ll never forget it, ever. It took him 15 minutes to do this. I’ll never forget it. You know, being able to feel loved when your entire mind is being warped and you’re being judged by society. Being able to have people do kind things for you, you’ll never forget. And so it’s not hard.

Sanders: A beautiful sentiment to end on, just showing up for people we love.

Jon: Not hard. It’s all we need to do.

Sanders: Yeah.



Jon: Surround me with those people and we will have a good, a good world and a good life, and that’s what we’re trying to do.

Sanders: Well, I want to thank you again for not just today, but the, the years now that you have spent with me patiently answering all my questions, indulging the stupid questions, explaining the things that I ask about over and over and over again. I’ve been so grateful for you and your whole family, and everyone who’s who’s kind of held my hand as we try to explore some of these ideas. So thank you very much.

Jon: Well, here’s my thank you to you. Thank you for paying attention to this. Thank you for making it an amazing online series, video series, podcast series to get the, phenomenal platform to get this message out because everybody should be doing this, and the fact that you are is absolutely commendable, and I, I will be a part of this and whatever you need from me for the rest of my life. Call, text, I’m there.

https://sciencenews.org,Buying carbon credits to fight climate change? Here’s what to know,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/carbon-credits-climate-change-emissions,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 13:00:00 GMT","Taylor Swift may not be the first person who comes to mind when you think about climate change. But more than once, the singer has found herself in the middle of a media storm over her carbon di­oxide emissions. Swift regularly hops aboard her private jet, as she did in 2024 to get from a concert in Tokyo to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas the next day. A spokesperson said that Swift purchases more than enough carbon credits to offset her jet-setting. But fans and haters alike want to know: Is it enough?

If you travel by plane, even in less-glamorous economy, you’ve probably faced a similar question. Airlines often offer passengers the option to pay a few extra dollars to offset their share of the flight’s emissions. It’s considered the climate-friendly thing to do. By purchasing carbon credits, you’re paying someone somewhere to take some action — probably saving an existing forest or perhaps planting trees — that reduces total global emissions enough to cover your contribution. You can take off without a guilty conscience. Supposedly.

Over the last few years, though, carbon credits have faced increasing scrutiny. A string of academic studies and media investigations have concluded that many credits do not represent genuine emissions savings. One investigation concluded that over 90 percent of carbon credits issued for rainforest protection by the largest carbon credit certification body “had no benefit to the climate.” Two reports published in 2023 found that credits for forest-based projects in North America, South America, Africa and Asia may in fact increase net emissions.

That same year, uncertainty over the validity of credits caused the voluntary carbon market to collapse; the market’s value dropped by more than 60 percent. Given the current situation, “it’s nearly impossible to be certain that what you’re buying is high integrity,” says Stephen Lezak, a researcher at the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project at the University of California, Berkeley.

Amid all the controversy, it’s not clear what a consumer (celebrity or not) should do. To buy or not to buy? But understanding what carbon credits are, how they work and why the system has gone wrong can help.

What are carbon credits?

As concern over climate change has grown, governments, companies, organizations and individuals have sought ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to keep the global average temperature to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Many are working toward net-zero goals, meaning that at some point in the future — by 2050 at the latest — any CO 2 emitted must be counterbalanced by eliminating emissions elsewhere or taking CO 2 out of the atmosphere.

Achieving net zero should begin with every effort to eliminate or reduce the burning of fossil fuels, the main cause of global warming, says Kaya Axelsson, head of policy and partnerships at Oxford Net Zero, a research program at the University of Oxford.

Offsetting via carbon credits is another way to balance the carbon checkbook. The idea first took hold in the 1980s and picked up in the following decade. Industrialized countries that ratified the 1997 Kyoto Protocol became part of a mandatory compliance market, in which a cap-and-trade system limited the quantity of greenhouse gases those countries could emit. An industrialized country emitting over its cap could purchase credits from another industrialized country that emitted less than its quota. Emitters could also offset CO 2 by investing in projects that reduced emissions in developing countries, which were not required to have targets.

“The atmosphere doesn’t care where the emissions reductions happen,” says Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project.

The United States, which did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, is not part of any compliance market, but such markets exist within the country. California’s cap-and-trade program, for one, requires the participation of about 450 businesses responsible for about 85 percent of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions.

According to the United Nations, countries’ commitments are falling short of what’s needed to reign in rising temperatures. And President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which superseded the Kyoto Protocol. The voluntary carbon market offers a private sector alternative to compliance markets.

Demand for a voluntary market took off in the early 2010s as more companies took on net-zero goals for public relations or ethical reasons, or both. One carbon credit represents one metric ton of CO 2 , either removed from the atmosphere or not emitted in the first place. Since the voluntary market’s inception, some 2 billion carbon credits have been issued, equivalent to about 5 percent of global annual emissions.

Offsetting is often cheaper than reducing, especially in cases where emissions-free options aren’t readily available, such as with jet fuel in the airline industry. If the cost to directly abate one ton of emissions is $1,000, but a company can buy a credit for much less, offsetting may make more sense, and cents.

Credits for removing CO 2 are usually straightforward, Lezak says. Whether it’s sucked from the air and stored underground or stashed in coastlines through mangrove restoration, “you can usually point to it [and] say, I took it out of the atmosphere,” he says.

But according to the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project’s Voluntary Registry Offsets Database, only about 4 percent of carbon credits in the voluntary market come from pure removals projects. The other 96 percent come from projects that claim to reduce or avoid emissions. They might limit methane released from landfills or swap solar panels in for fossil fuel–based power. The largest component of credits comes from avoided deforestation, in which forests that probably would have been felled are instead preserved.

How are carbon credits issued?

A carbon project involving forests typically begins with a landowner who is interested in taking some offsetting action. Perhaps a farmer decides not to cut down a patch of trees for agriculture. A project developer helps the landowner turn that offsetting action into carbon credits that compensate the farmer for the lack of produce — and profit. The developer works through a carbon credit certification body that’s responsible for verifying the project and issuing credits. Such organizations have methodologies for calculating how much carbon will be stored and converting that amount into carbon credits.

After the project is implemented, the developer hires a third-party auditor approved by the certification body to sign off on the project. Only after this independent look will the certification body issue credits.

“It’s nearly impossible to be certain

that what you’re buying is high

integrity.” Stephen Lezak

a researcher at the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project

From there, the developer will often partner with a broker to find buyers. Brokers work on commission or buy credits from the developer and try to sell them at a profit.

Carbon credits can be bought, sold and bundled in complicated ways before they’re ever used to offset emissions, Lezak says. That’s the final step in the process — retiring a credit — at which point it can no longer be bought and sold. Most often, when a credit is retired, it’s used to offset emissions generated from a carbon-intensive activity, like flying. But a credit can also be retired without any actual offsetting.

By bundling credits that haven’t been retired and selling them in packages, brokers hedge against the reality that many credits may be of low quality, Lezak says. “The pooling mechanism gives the appearance of some protection against those risks.” Yet projects that go through the certification process may suffer from overcrediting, promising more emissions reductions than they can actually achieve.

The problem of additionality

For a carbon credit to be issued, emissions reductions must be additional, meaning those greenhouse gases would have been emitted if the project didn’t exist. If a landowner never planned to cut down a forest to begin with, the purported reductions are nonadditional.

Correctly calculating additionality requires accurately determining the baseline, business-as-usual scenario, says Alexander Shenkin, a forest ecosystem ecologist at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. But when baselines are incorrectly calculated, they usually result in too many credits being issued. A study published in 2023 in Science, for example, found that incorrect baselines led to carbon credits issued in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania and Zambia with no evidence of avoided deforestation. Forests were not at risk of being cut down, so the projects were nonadditional.

Some projects, Axelsson says, “sell four or five credits for every one ton of carbon.” When a business, country or individual uses meaningless credits to counterbalance their emissions, they are not achieving neutrality.

In a now famous example of overcrediting reported in the New Yorker, a company hired to sell credits for a project in Zimbabwe originally calculated that the project would keep about 50 million tons of CO 2 from the atmosphere. But after implementing an approved methodology, that number jumped to some 200 million credits to be issued over the course of the project. The project was paused before all credits could be issued, but by at least one estimate, the project had 30 times as many credits as it should have based on actual emissions savings.

Carbon credits on the voluntary market As of the end of 2024, 2.2 billion carbon credits have been issued on the voluntary market. Nearly 70 percent have come from forest management and renewable energy projects. Direct emissions removal through carbon capture and storage accounts for just 1 percent. B.K. HAYA ET AL /VOLUNTARY REGISTRY OFFSETS DATABASE 2025 ( CC BY-SA 4.0 ) B.K. HAYA ET AL /VOLUNTARY REGISTRY OFFSETS DATABASE 2025 ( CC BY-SA 4.0 )

Excess credits undercut the price of legitimate ones, according to a paper published in 2020 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. When demand was high for carbon credits, as it was before 2023, the price per credit should have been high. But with a large supply of poor-quality credits flooding the market, the price stayed relatively low.

According to S&P Global, the price of nature-based avoidance credits went from $11.50 per ton of CO 2 to just $3.50 over the course of 2023. In contrast, technological carbon capture credits hovered around $120 per ton of CO 2 .

Third-party auditors can’t do much to improve projects, says former auditor Thales West, a forest scientist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and lead author of the papers in Science and PNAS. “All I’m doing is checking the boxes that are related to the rules.… I wouldn’t have the power to say: You’re not going to get the certification.”

More credits mean more money for the developer. Plus, the certification body gets paid per credit issued, so there’s an incentive to issue more credits. And because the developer pays the auditor, “there is a financial incentive for the auditor to sign off,” says Elias Ayrey, cofounder of Renoster, a start-up that independently scores the quality of carbon projects.

If an auditor approves a project, they’re more likely to get hired again, says Libby Blanchard, a political ecologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. “If there’s some way to make the auditing process more independent and less tied to the outcome that the auditor provides, we would have a much better and transparent market.”

Problems of leakage and permanence

Another dilemma is that carbon credits often ignore the interconnectedness of the world; actions in one place affect what happens elsewhere. If a rancher chooses not to turn forest into lucrative cattle-grazing land, that action is additional and seems to be deserving of carbon credits. But if the demand for the beef remains, deforestation might just happen elsewhere.

“Leakage happens when supply is restricted, but demand is unchanged,” Lezak says. An article in Climate Policy in 2021 illustrates the point. Deforestation shifted from Brazil’s Amazon to the less-regulated Cerrado — an incredibly biodiverse tropical savanna — after Brazil adopted the Amazon Soy Moratorium. Under the moratorium, established in 2006, soybean traders agreed not to purchase soy grown from newly deforested Amazon lands. However, the moratorium led to a 31 percent increase in soy production in the Cerrado. Deforestation there rose by an estimated 13 percent.

Carbon projects, Lezak says, should be additional while also decreasing demand. Providing someone who cooks over an open fire with a fuel-efficient cookstove, for example, reduces emissions thanks to the increased energy efficiency. It also reduces local demand for wood, meaning less deforestation, without shifting demand elsewhere.

But even those projects may result in overcrediting, depending on how the emissions savings are calculated and how long and often the cookstoves are used. Because a project in Mozambique used stoves that couldn’t withstand rain, for instance, the stoves were largely abandoned earlier than expected.

What can go wrong? Carbon credit projects can fail to achieve offsetting for a number of reasons. Nonadditionality

A carbon credit must be additional — the greenhouse gases would have been emitted if the project didn’t exist. If a protected forest, for example, was never in jeopardy of deforestation, the carbon credit isn’t preventing any emissions. Inaccurate baseline

If a project’s emissions savings are incorrectly calculated, more credits may be issued than the project will actually offset. Leakage

A project should not increase the demand for an emitting activity. If a cattle rancher preserves forest but trees elsewhere are instead cleared for grazing land, there is no emissions reduction. No permanence

Unforeseen circumstances, say, a wildfire in a protected forest, could cause a project to lose the carbon it has stored or removed, reversing the benefit.

Issues of permanence — project longevity — can also plague forest projects. Though they are designed to store carbon for a century, the projects are prone to wildfires, disease and illegal logging. “If that forest doesn’t last for 100 years,” Blanchard says, “that carbon was only temporarily sequestered.”

Developers are supposed to check on the forests every five years or so. “But if something has gone terribly wrong,” Ayrey says, “the developer isn’t going … to report that.” The result: “zombie” credits from failed projects that are used for offsetting.

The major certification bodies require some portion of credits issued for each carbon project be set aside and held in a buffer pool to function as a kind of insurance in case of catastrophe.

But buffer pools may be too small, as demonstrated in a 2022 study in Frontiers in Forests and Global Change. Looking at California’s forest carbon offsets, researchers found that wildfires had depleted nearly one-fifth of the buffer pool in less than a decade. When also accounting for disease, the scientists concluded that the buffer pool isn’t likely to guarantee the integrity of California’s offsets program for the requisite century. Plus, because greenhouses gases can last in the atmosphere for thousands of years, some experts argue that the century standard is not long enough anyway.

How to improve the voluntary carbon market

Government regulation of the voluntary carbon market could help ensure that carbon credits meet a standard quality, Ayrey says.

Regulation could also help with transparency. Each certification body has its own registry. “You know what credits have been issued, and then the next thing you know is who’s retired them, but you don’t know how many times the credits were bought and sold, and by whom,” Haya says. Along the way, she says, “you don’t know anything about prices.”

In September, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission adopted its first guidelines for the voluntary carbon market. Though guidelines do not have the same leverage as regulations, the guidelines were instrumental in bringing fraud charges against the U.S.-based developers of the Mozambique cookstove project. However, it is unclear how much of a role the government will play in more rigorously regulating the market.

For forest projects, remote-sensing technologies, which can quickly image forests in and around projects to better determine baselines, could improve transparency. Because monitoring can be monthly, weekly or even daily, satellites can also keep an eye out for leakage and permanence problems.

Independent companies that rate carbon credits are springing up to do this kind of eyes-in-the-sky work. Buyers looking to purchase high-quality credits can pay start-ups like Renoster to assess projects.

“The atmosphere doesn’t care where the emissions reductions happen.” Barbara Haya

director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project

Some companies have stopped bothering with offsetting and started focusing on reducing the emissions they can control. These companies don’t want to buy low-quality credits, Lezak says. They also don’t want the PR backlash — or even lawsuits — that can come with false claims of neutrality, Shenkin notes.

Blanchard and colleagues argued last year in One Earth that credits based on emissions offsets is not a good system. Participants need to recognize that, in the market’s current state, “we’re not truly reducing our emissions,” Blanchard says.

The researchers envision a framework in which offset projects are reframed as climate mitigation projects. Companies or individuals may buy carbon credits or otherwise donate to projects. But “instead of claiming that you’re offsetting your emissions, you’re claiming that you’re contributing to global climate mitigation,” Blanchard says.

This scheme would eliminate the need for brokers and other middlemen. And it would preserve many of the co-benefits that stem from some of these projects. Many forest projects, for example, double as conservation efforts that maintain air quality and biodiversity. Some projects, Ayrey says, also return some revenue to people who live in or near the forests.

Because funding is coming mostly from industrialized countries, the carbon market can bring in conservation funds to developing countries.

Without the market, “there’s one fewer way that we have to conserve these forests,” Shenkin says.

Ultimately, though, the market must shift toward removal-based technologies, Axelsson says, and encourage investment in new technologies for carbon capture and long-term storage.

So, should you buy carbon credits to offset airlines emissions?

When it comes to buying carbon credits through an airline, Axelsson says she sometimes clicks “yes” as a signal that people do care about climate change — and demand action. “But I click ‘yes’ knowing that that’s not an offset,” she says.

Another option is to estimate your emissions and support carbon projects on your own. An internet search will often reveal scandals, Ayrey says, and thus projects to avoid. Renoster also makes its reports public.

You can also vet companies based on whether they’re moving toward mitigation strategies that reduce their carbon footprint. The Science Based Targets initiative dashboard captures what companies around the world have pledged to do.

In the end, if individuals want to reduce their carbon footprints, changing behavior will have a bigger impact than buying carbon credits, West argues. “You have to fly less, consume less meat, use bikes more.”

Blanchard agrees. Permanently reducing your emissions, she says, “is way more meaningful.”",sciencenews
https://sciencenews.org,"How silicon turns tomato plants into mean, green, pest-killing machines",https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silicon-tomatoes-kill-pests-pinworms,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT","Silicon powers more than electronics: In tomato plants, it fuels a complex defense system that could help farmers use fewer pesticides.

Tomato plants on four continents are currently under attack from the South American tomato pinworm (Tuta absoluta), which destroys billions of dollars of crops each year. The impact can be particularly devastating for small-scale farmers in Africa, where the pest has invaded over the last decade, says chemical ecologist Baldwyn Torto of the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Nairobi, Kenya. These pinworms, also known as tomato leaf miners, have become resistant to heavily used chemical pesticides, says ICIPE molecular biologist Fathiya Khamis — so new solutions are urgently needed.

Researchers knew that adding silicon to soil can fortify some crops against pests. Some plants use the element to physically strengthen their cells; tomatoes use silicon to kick-start a complex array of biochemical and genetic defense systems. Now, Torto, Khamis and their colleagues have uncovered some specifics of how silicon transforms tomatoes into pinworm-killing machines, the team reports in the March 24 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

When the researchers supplemented tomato plants’ soil with silicon-containing nanoparticles and exposed the plants to pinworm moths, the tomato stems produced a mysterious dark goo at the base of hairlike structures called trichomes. This dark substance appeared to lure pinworm mothers into laying eggs more frequently on tomato stems, instead of mostly on leaves. When pinworm caterpillars hatched and ate this “larval toffee,” they often did not survive.

A South American tomato pinworm (Tuta absoluta) eats a sticky sugar-wax compound produced by a tomato plant. Tomatoes treated with silicon produced this dark goo, which reduced survival of the invasive pests. Torto et al / PNAS 2025

The researchers analyzed the gooey substance and found a blend of sugars and wax. This mix was enticingly sweet but contained the wrong blend of nutrients to support caterpillar growth. To make matters worse for the pinworms, this plant potion also altered caterpillar microbiomes. Droppings from pinworms that ate the substance released a blend of gases that attracted two different species of pinworm-killing insects.

More information about how and where these tomatoes accumulate silicon is needed to confirm silicon’s role in this response, says plant pathologist Lawrence Datnoff of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Datnoff, who was not involved with the study, points out that different tomato plants accumulate silicon in different ways, so “you’ve got to have the right controls.” Despite this, Datnoff says he has long advocated for using silicon to manage plant health.

The researchers say that this study is the first step toward testing various silicon formulations for optimal crop yield and pest resistance, which could ultimately apply to other similar insects as well as the tomato pinworm. “This is good for the farmer,” Torto says. “You are basically enhancing biological control of the pests.”",sciencenews

If it ever impacted our planet it could wipe out a large city.

A ""potentially hazardous"" pyramid-size asteroid is about to zoom past Earth at around 48,000 mph (77,300 km/h) this week as it reaches its closest point to our planet in more than 100 years. But the hefty space rock poses zero risk of hitting us now or in the future, data shows.

On Wednesday (March 26), at around 7:30 a.m. ET, asteroid 2014 TN17 will come within 3.2 million miles (5.1 million kilometers) of Earth — or around 13 times further away than the moon, according to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) . This is the closest approach predicted for the asteroid across almost 300 years of JPL simulations, which included calculations of all of its flybys between 1906 to 2200.

Researchers estimate that it is around 540 feet (165 meters) wide. That is slightly wider than the height of Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza and makes it large enough to wipe out a city if it impacted our planet. NASA classifies 2014 TN17 as "" potentially hazardous "" because of its size and occasional proximity to Earth. However, that does not mean it is dangerous.

During the upcoming flyby, the asteroid will be too far away to be observed with a backyard telescope or stargazing binoculars . However, it is large enough for researchers to study it and the space rock is currently scheduled to be observed by NASA's Goldstone Solar System Radar (GSSR) system in California, which specializes in observing nearby solar system objects as they pass us by.

In recent years, the GSSR telescope has helped reveal the unusual ""snowman"" shape of one asteroid, detect changes in the orbital trajectories of another and discover a mini-moon orbiting a third. The upcoming observations could yield similarly interesting insights about 2014 TN17.

Close encounters

There are currently around 2,500 known potentially hazardous asteroids, according to the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center . None of them are predicted to hit Earth anytime soon. However, there are a few that will get quite close.

One such space rock is the potential city-killer asteroid 2024 YR4, which made headlines earlier this year when the chances of it hitting our planet in 2032 rose as high as 3.1% . The odds of impact have since dropped to zero . However, there is still a slim chance that it may crash into the moon .

Another asteroid that will have a near-miss of Earth is the hefty ""god of chaos"" asteroid Apophis, which will come closer to our planet than some satellites in 2029. There is currently zero chance of it hitting us . Some researchers warn that this could change if its trajectory is altered by another asteroid en route — and we may not realize if this has happened for several years.

https://livescience.com,China's new 2D transistor could soon be used to make the world's fastest processors,https://www.livescience.com/technology/electronics/chinas-new-2d-transistor-could-1-day-be-used-to-make-the-worlds-fastest-processors,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:00:10 GMT","2D bismuth transistors are less brittle and more flexible than transistors made using conventional silicon, the scientists said in the new study.

Researchers in China say they have created a new silicon-free transistor that could significantly boost performance while reducing energy consumption. The team says this development represents a new direction for transistor research.

The scientists said that the new transistor could be integrated into chips that could one day perform up to 40% faster than the best existing silicon processors made by U.S. companies like Intel. This is according to a report in the South China Morning Post (SCMP).

Despite that dramatic increase in power, the researchers claim that such chips would also draw 10% less power. The scientists outlined their findings in a new study published Feb. 13 in the journal Nature .

Lead author of the study Hailin Peng , professor of chemistry at Peking University (PKU) in China, told SCMP: ""If chip innovations based on existing materials are considered a 'short cut', then our development of 2D material-based transistors is akin to 'changing lanes'.""

A new kind of silicon-free transistor

The efficiency and performance gains are possible thanks to the chip's unique architecture, the scientists said in the paper, specifically the new two-dimensional silicon-free transistor they created. This transistor is a gate-all-around field-effect transistor (GAAFET). Unlike previous leading transistor designs like the fin field-effect transistor (FinFET), a GAAFET transistor wraps sources with a gate on all four sides, instead of just three.

At its most basic level, a transistor is a semiconductor device found in every computer chip. Each transistor has a source, a gate and a drain, which allow the transistor to function as a switch.

The gate is how a transistor controls the flow of current between the source and drain terminals and can act as both a switch and amplifier. Wrapping this gate around all sides of a source (or sources, as some transistors contain multiple) — instead of just three as in conventional transistors — leads to potential improvements in both performance and efficiency.

This is because a fully wrapped source provides better electrostatic control (as there is less energy loss to static electricity discharges) and the potential for higher drive currents and faster switching times.

While the GAAFET architecture isn’t itself new, the PKU team's use of bismuth oxyselenide as the semiconductor was, as well as the fact they used it to create an ""atomically-thin"" two-dimensional transistor.

2D bismuth transistors are less brittle and more flexible than traditional silicon, the scientists added in the study. Bismuth provides better carrier mobility —the speed at which electrons can move through it when an electrical field is applied. It also has a high dielectric constant — a measure of a material's ability to store electrical energy — which contributes to the transistor’s increased efficiency.",livescience

Sunrise on Saturday, March 29, will look rather odd from the northeastern coast of North America. With a deep partial solar eclipse already in progress, a crescent sun will appear on the eastern horizon.

Thirteen U.S. states will see the March 29 solar eclipse in some form, with a deeper eclipse visible the farther northeast you go. Coastal New England will get the best views. In Maine, up to 86% of the sun will be eclipsed as it rises. New Hampshire and Massachusetts will see up to 57% and 55% coverage, respectively. Boston will see a 43% eclipse.

The eclipse will be more modest in other areas of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. New York City will experience 21% obscuration, and the coverage will be less in Philadelphia (11%); Rochester, New York (8%); and Washington, D.C. (1.2%). Although many observers across the region will be able to glimpse a slight eclipse as the sun rises higher into the eastern sky, the best views will be from a coastal location as far north as possible.

Note: Because this is a partial eclipse, viewers MUST use protective eyewear at all times, be it a pair of certified solar eclipse glasses , or a backyard telescope equipped with a solar filter.

You'll also need clear sight lines to the sunrise, which will take place slightly to the east-northeast. You can use Time and Date's map and The Photographer's Ephemeris to find suitable locations.

A 'double sunrise'

Seeing an eclipsed sunrise is a rare opportunity in itself, but from some locations, it will be possible to glimpse a ""double sunrise"" as the silhouette of the moon makes the rising sun look like two separate ""horns"" emerging from the horizon.

That unusual sight will be restricted to northeastern Maine, southwestern New Brunswick and eastern Quebec. Prime coastal viewing spots include Quoddy Head State Park and South Lubec in Maine; Forestville, Quebec; and St. Andrews, New Brunswick, all of which will host an 83% to 87% eclipsed ""double sunrise.""

Atlantic Canada will see a smaller eclipsed sunrise, with the eclipse deepening shortly thereafter. Moncton, New Brunswick, will see 84%, with similar obscuration in Halifax, Nova Scotia (82%), and St. John's, Newfoundland (82%). Quebec City will see a 72% eclipsed sunrise, and Montreal and Ottawa, Ontario, will get 46% and 29%, respectively.

No eclipse will be visible in Toronto. The point of maximum eclipse will be close to Akulivik, Nunavik, in northern Quebec, where a 91% eclipsed sunrise will be seen.

Iceland, Europe, and Africa

Beyond North America, it's a midmorning event. Reykjavik, Iceland, will experience 67%, but the scene will be much less dramatic in London (31%), Paris (24%), Madrid (20%), Berlin (15%), Vienna (6%) and Rome ( 2%). On the coast of Morocco, from Tangier to Agadir, around 15% to 18% of the sun will be obscured.

The next solar eclipse — another partial one — will occur on Sept. 21, 2025, and will be visible from Antarctica, New Zealand and the southwestern South Pacific. The next partial solar eclipse in North America will be on Aug. 12, 2026 (and will be a total solar eclipse in Spain, Iceland, Greenland, Russia and a small area of Portugal).

https://livescience.com,Intelligent aliens would need a power supply to jump-start their civilization — would they require fossil fuels?,https://www.livescience.com/space/extraterrestrial-life/intelligent-aliens-would-need-a-power-supply-to-jumpstart-their-civilization-would-they-require-fossil-fuels,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 09:00:00 GMT","The burning of fossil fuels — coal, oil and gas — propelled humanity into the industrial revolution, remaking civilization in its wake. Gasoline powers many of the cars we drive; coal and natural gas are central to global energy. But if aliens were building their own society, would they have to go down the same path as humanity, relying on fossil fuels to build their advanced civilization? Or could they find an alternative?

To build a modern civilization, aliens would likely need to use a source of energy that's just as abundant as fossil fuels, said Lewis Dartnell , an astrobiologist and author of "" The Knowledge: How to Rebuild Our World from Scratch "" (Penguin Press, 2014). It would be hard for them to simply bypass the production of fossil fuels, he noted.

Dartnell drew a parallel with humans: In the 18th century, the world entered the industrial revolution by tapping into what appeared to be a limitless source of energy. Coal burned longer and produced more power than wood and charcoal.

""Prior to that, energy was the fundamental limitation on how much you could do,"" he said. ""It would limit how much you could mine and move things around, what you could build, and what you could make.""

The question of whether humans could have bypassed fossil fuels to reach alternative energy sources is ""somewhat of a chicken-and-egg dilemma ,"" Dartnell told Live Science. For instance, producing solar panels requires silicon , and extracting and refining this element demands a significant amount of energy.

Related: How do we turn oil into plastic?

The easiest way for intelligent aliens to create fuel would be to start by burning stuff, like humans did, until they can move to other sources of energy. They could perhaps harness the light of a star or of the kinetic energy of the wind. But wind energy on its own would not create the high temperatures needed for the smelting, forging and casting of metals, which would be needed for industrialization, Dartnell said.

Meanwhile, hydropower would only work if the planet had significant amounts of accessible liquid, which most planets we've found don't possess, added Seth Shostak , an astronomer and director of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute.

Could other planets have fossil fuels?

Scientists still haven't found a planet with abundant oxygen in its atmosphere, though trace amounts have been found on Mars, Venus and Jupiter's moon Europa. Oxygen is the key ingredient in burning fossil fuels because it enables combustion, which is what releases the energy stored in coal, oil and gas.

Fossil fuels are created from life — they're the transformed remains of plants and animals that lived hundreds of millions of years ago. Dartnell suggested that plate tectonics are a crucial part of the puzzle of how these life forms came to exist. ""There's good reason to suspect that in order to have intelligent life on an Earth-like planet, you need to have plate tectonics to regulate the climate for long periods of time,"" he said.

A 2022 study by researchers at the University of Sydney reported how Earth's tectonic plates move carbon between the deep Earth and the surface, forming what they call a ""carbon conveyor belt."" This process is key to maintaining Earth's ""Goldilocks"" climate, making the planet habitable, according to the study. What's more, plate tectonics also results in continental drift and the creation of conditions that produce large amounts of coal, a fossil fuel, he added.

Put another way, plate tectonics can help pave the way for life and create conditions to help it become fossil fuels; it can also create ideal conditions for life that may become intelligent enough to harness those fuels.

""In a sense, you get a two-for-one,"" Dartnell said. ""If you have a planet with active plate tectonics, that regulates the climate, which allows for the evolution of intelligent complex life.""

Scientists have yet to find another planet with active plate tectonics . Nor have they found fossil fuels in space. What they have discovered, however, is evidence of fossil fuels' chemical building blocks: hydrogen and carbon. Approximately 75% of the universe's mass is composed of hydrogen, said Shostak. Additionally, scientists have found a field of liquid hydrocarbons on Saturn's moon Titan . Intelligent aliens could, hypothetically, attempt to burn these elements to produce energy.

A human point of view

Of course, aliens aren't necessarily bound by the same constraints as humans, and our imagination often limits us to thinking in terms of a human timeline. ""It's hard for us to predict what the aliens might do,"" Shostak told Live Science. It's like asking Julius Caesar what he thought the Romans would be doing with oil in 2025, when they were only using small amounts of oil for lamps . ""Julius would probably have some ideas, all based on Roman knowledge,"" he said. ""He would completely miss the [mark]. You have to keep that in mind.""

An intelligent alien civilization could be nothing like what we expect, Shostak added. While aliens would likely need an abundant energy source to advance their civilization, who's to say what form that energy would take? The answer could lie beyond human understanding.

The standing figure is missing its feet, which were once attached by gold wire, as well as the accessories and objects it once held in its hands. Only a ""fancy nose ornament"" remains on the figure, a clue that the figurine once donned a headdress on ritual occasions, according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, where the statue is located.

The gold figurine, which is roughly 9 inches (22.9 centimeters) tall, was made between the first and fourth centuries near what is now the border of Colombia and Ecuador in the Cayapas River delta area.

Known in Colombia as the Tumaco culture and in Ecuador as the Tolita culture, the Tumaco-Tolita civilization arose in an area full of rivers, swamps, forests, and natural gold and platinum deposits. They created large plazas ringed by villages and constructed earthen mounds that were both residences and burial mounds for the elite, according to Met researcher Hugo Ikehara-Tsukayama . Between 200 B.C. and A.D. 400, the Tumaco-Tolita produced one of the most refined metalwork traditions in the Americas and traded with other communities in the area.

This gold figure may represent a woman, since it was more common to mark a sculpture with nipples for female statues than for male statues, Ikehara-Tsukayama said. However, skirts were also common in female images, so the lack of one on this sculpture means the figure's gender is ambiguous.

The flattened head likely reflects the cultural practice of cranial vault modification, which involves binding a baby's head so that the skull grows in a different shape. This skull shape may have signaled that the person was high in social rank or importance.

Remains of human and animal sculptures in metal and clay have been found throughout Tumaco-Tolita settlements and in their graves, but the exact function of the sculptures is unknown.",livescience

https://theconversation.com,Trump silences the Voice of America: end of a propaganda machine or void for China and Russia to fill?,https://theconversation.com/trump-silences-the-voice-of-america-end-of-a-propaganda-machine-or-void-for-china-and-russia-to-fill-252901,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 18:32:32 GMT","Of all the contradictions and ironies of Donald Trump’s second presidency so far, perhaps the most surprising has been his shutting down the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM) for being “radical propaganda”.

Critics have long accused the agency – and its affiliated outlets such as Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia – of being a propaganda arm of US foreign policy.

But to the current president, the USAGM has become a promoter of anti-American ideas and agendas – including allegedly suppressing stories critical of Iran, sympathetically covering the issue of “white privilege” and bowing to pressure from China.

Propaganda is clearly in the eye of the beholder. The Moscow Times reported Russian officials were elated by the demise of the “purely propagandistic” outlets, while China’s Global Times celebrated the closure of a “lie factory”.

Meanwhile, the European Commission hailed USAGM outlets as a “beacon of truth, democracy and hope”. All of which might have left the average person understandably confused: Voice of America? Wasn’t that the US propaganda outlet from World War II?

Well, yes. But the reality of USAGM and similar state-sponsored global media outlets is more complex – as are the implications of the US agency’s demise.

Public service or state propaganda?

The USAGM is one of several international public service media outlets based in western democracies. Others include Australia’s ABC International, the BBC World Service, CBC/Radio-Canada, France Médias Monde, NHK-World Japan, Deutsche Welle in Germany and SRG SSR in Switzerland.

Part of the Public Media Alliance, they are similar to national public service media, largely funded by taxpayers to uphold democratic ideals of universal access to news and information.

Unlike national public media, however, they might not be consumed – or even known – by domestic audiences. Rather, they typically provide news to countries without reliable independent media due to censorship or state-run media monopolies.

The USAGM, for example, provides news in 63 languages to more than 100 countries. It has been credited with bringing attention to issues such as protests against COVID-19 lockdowns in China and women’s struggles for equal rights in Iran.

On the other hand, the independence of USAGM outlets has been questioned often, particularly as they are required to share government-mandated editorials.

Voice of America has been criticised for its focus on perceived ideological adversaries such as Russia and Iran. And my own research has found it perpetuates stereotypes and the neglect of African nations in its news coverage.

Leaving a void

Ultimately, these global media outlets wouldn’t exist if there weren’t benefits for the governments that fund them. Sharing stories and perspectives that support or promote certain values and policies is an effective form of “public diplomacy”.

Yet these international media outlets differ from state-controlled media models because of editorial systems that protect them from government interference.

The Voice of America’s “firewall”, for instance, “prohibits interference by any US government official in the objective, independent reporting of news”. Such protections allow journalists to report on their own governments more objectively.

In contrast, outlets such as China Media Group (CMG), RT from Russia, and PressTV from Iran also reach a global audience in a range of languages. But they do this through direct government involvement. CMG subsidiary CCTV+, for example, states it is “committed to telling China’s story to the rest of the world”.

Though RT states it is an autonomous media outlet, research has found the Russian government oversees hiring editors, imposing narrative angles, and rejecting stories.

Other voices get louder

The biggest concern for western democracies is that these other state-run media outlets will fill the void the USAGM leaves behind – including in the Pacific.

Russia, China and Iran are increasing funding for their state-run news outlets, with China having spent more than US$6.6 billion over 13 years on its global media outlets. China Media Group is already one of the largest media conglomerates in the world, providing news content to more than 130 countries in 44 languages.

And China has already filled media gaps left by western democracies: after the ABC stopped broadcasting Radio Australia in the Pacific, China Radio International took over its frequencies.

Worryingly, the differences between outlets such as Voice of America and more overtly state-run outlets aren’t immediately clear to audiences, as government ownership isn’t advertised.

An Australian senator even had to apologise recently after speaking with PressTV, saying she didn’t know the news outlet was affiliated with the Iranian government, or that it had been sanctioned in Australia.

Switched off

Trump’s move to dismantle the USAGM doesn’t come as a complete surprise, however. As the authors of Capturing News, Capturing Democracy: Trump and the Voice of America described, the first Trump administration failed in its attempts to remove the firewall and install loyalists.

This perhaps explains why Trump has resorted to more drastic measures this time. And, as with many of the current administration’s legally dubious actions, there has been resistance.

The American Foreign Service Association says it will challenge the dismantling of the USAGM, while the Czech Republic is seeking EU support to keep Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty on the air.

But for many of the agency’s journalists, contractors, broadcasting partners and audiences, it may be too late. Last week the New York Times reported some Voice of America broadcasts had already been replaced by music.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Giving rivers room to move: how rethinking flood management can benefit people and nature,https://theconversation.com/giving-rivers-room-to-move-how-rethinking-flood-management-can-benefit-people-and-nature-251225,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 01:22:11 GMT","When we think about flood management, higher stop banks, stronger levees and concrete barriers usually come to mind. But what if the best solution – for people and nature – isn’t to confine rivers, but to give them more space?

This alternative is increasingly being considered as an approach to mitigating flood risk. But allowing rivers room to move also delivers ecological benefits far beyond flood risk reduction. It supports biodiversity, improves water quality and stores carbon.

As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme floods, rethinking our approach to managing floodplain rivers has never been more urgent.

Climate change, floods and river confinement

Climate change is amplifying flood risks worldwide, and Aotearoa New Zealand is no exception. Large floods are expected to become much more frequent and severe, threatening communities, infrastructure and ecosystems.

Many of these risks are made worse by past management decisions that have artificially confined rivers within narrow channels, cutting them off from their natural floodplains.

Floodplain river systems have historically been dynamic, shifting across landscapes over time. But extensive stop banks, modification of river channels and land development have restricted this natural variability.

Strangling rivers in this way transfers and heightens flood risks downstream by forcing water through confined channels at greater speeds. It also degrades ecosystems that rely on the natural ebb and flow of river processes.

Background satellite image: Google (c) 2025 Airbus , CC BY-SA

Giving rivers space to roam

The idea of allowing rivers to reclaim space on their floodplains is not new.

In the Netherlands, the Room for the River programme was a response to flooding in 1995 that led to large-scale evacuations of people and cattle. In England, predictions that economic risks associated with flooding will increase 20-fold within this century ignited the Making Space for Water strategy.

However, these initiatives typically remain focused on flood protection, overlooking opportunities to maximise ecological benefits. Our new research shows that well-designed approaches can deliver ecological gains alongside flood protection.

This is crucial because floodplain river systems are among the most valuable ecosystems. They provide about a quarter of all land-based ecosystem services such as water retention and pollutant filtration, as well as educational, recreational and cultural benefits.

Managing rivers for variability

A fundamental shift in river management involves acknowledging and accommodating natural variability. Floodplain rivers are not static: they change across landscapes and through time, responding to seasonal flows, sediment movement and ecological processes.

Angus McIntosh , CC BY-SA

Our research synthesises the ecological processes that are enabled when floodplain rivers have room to move.

Rivers that are not unnaturally confined are typically more physically complex. For instance, along with the main river channel, they might have smaller side channels, or areas where the water pools and slows, springs popping up from below ground to re-join the surface waters, or ponds on the floodplain.

A diverse range of habitats supports a rich variety of plant and animal life. Even exposed gravel, made available in rivers that flow freely, provides critical nesting sites for endangered birds.

Biodiversity is not one-dimensional. Instead, it exists and operates at multiple scales, from a small floodplain pond to a whole river catchment or wider. In a dynamic, ever-changing riverscape, we might find the genetic composition of a species varying in different parts of the river, or the same species of fish varying in their body size, depending on the habitat conditions.

These examples of natural biological variability enable species and ecosystems to be resilient in the face of uncertain future conditions.

At a larger scale, the type and number of species that live in different floodplain river habitats also varies. This diversity of biological communities produces variation in the functions ecosystems perform across the river, such as the uptake of nutrients or processing of organic matter. This can even help to diversify food webs.

These variations mean not all species or groups of species in the river will be vulnerable to the same disturbances – such as droughts or floods – at the same time. This is because plants and animals in rivers have evolved to take advantage of long-term rhythms of floods and droughts in different ways.

For instance, the cottonwood poplars of the southwest United States time their seed release with the highly predictable rhythms of snowmelt-driven spring floods in that part of the world. In Aotearoa New Zealand, whitebait fish species typically deposit their eggs during high autumn flows, which then get transported to sea as larvae during high winter flows.

Some animals need multiple habitats within the river for different stages of life. Other creatures travel from afar to use river floodplains for only a short time. The latter includes the banded dotterel (Charadrius bicinctus), endemic to Aotearoa New Zealand. This bird travels as far as 1,700km to nest on braided-river gravels each spring. Banded dotterels are in decline, and they rely on habitats provided by rivers that have space to roam.

A call for more sustainable river management

As climate change accelerates, we must rethink how we manage our waterways. Reinforcing levees and deepening channels may seem like logical responses to increased flood risk, but these approaches often exacerbate long-term vulnerabilities and transfer risk elsewhere.

We call for practitioners to broaden the scope of values included in river management policy and programmes to include ecological variability.

Nature-based solutions are approaches that seek to benefit both people and nature. By working with nature rather than against it, we can create landscapes that are more resilient, adaptive, and supportive of both people and biodiversity.

It’s time to embrace a new paradigm for river management – one that sees rivers not as threats to be controlled, but as lifelines to be protected and restored.",theconversation

With Republicans now in control of both the Senate and House of Representatives, Congress has so far shown little sign it will stand in Trump’s way.

The judiciary is the other branch of government that can check the power of the president. However, the Trump administration has appeared increasingly willing to simply ignore decisions handed down by judges.

There has also been a notable lack of unified opposition from the Democratic Party.

Congressional Democrats are demoralised and deeply divided over how to respond to Trump. They face criticism, too, over their apparent lack of strategy.

This has led some to ask why the United States lacks a formal political opposition leader.

How opposition leaders operate in other countries

In the American political system, the loser of the presidential election doesn’t retain a position as leader of the party in opposition. Instead, they tend to disappear from view.

Kamala Harris is considering a run for governor of California — and could well attempt another run for president in 2028 or beyond. But she hasn’t remained a vocal counterpoint to Trump since he took office.

By contrast, in countries with Westminster-style parliamentary systems, such as Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada and India, the main party not in power selects an opposition leader from among their ranks. In most countries, this position is defined by convention, not law.

The opposition leader in many countries serves as the main face — and voice — of the party not in power. They work to keep the government accountable and are seen as the leader of an alternative government-in-waiting.

What it takes to lead the opposition in the US

During Trump’s first term, the Democratic speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, was widely recognised as the de facto Democratic opposition leader.

A skilled negotiator, Pelosi was largely able to unite the Democrats behind her to lead the opposition to Trump’s legislative agenda — famously ripping up a copy of Trump’s State of the Union address on the House podium in 2020.

As Senate majority and minority leader, Republican Senator Mitch McConnell successfully blocked swathes of legislation during Barack Obama’s presidency. He even thwarted a US Supreme Court nomination.

In the 1980s, then-Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill led the Democratic opposition to Republican President Ronald Reagan’s domestic agenda, without resorting to obstructionism.

However, for an opposition figure to have this level of influence, they usually need decades of experience, political skill, and a party in control of the House or Senate.

The Democrats no longer have a majority in either chamber and are no longer led by Pelosi. Hakeem Jeffries has been the House minority leader since 2023, but without the speaker’s gavel or control of any committees, he has limited influence.

Party discipline is typically far more unwieldy in the United States compared to other countries. In Australia, for instance, crossing the floor to vote against your own party is very rare.

Unruly party caucuses make it significantly more difficult for a single party figurehead to emerge unless they command near-universal party loyalty and respect among their members in both chambers.

Will Democratic cracks shatter the party?

The Democratic caucus, already strained by Joe Biden’s late withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race, is now even more fractured.

The Democrats continue to grapple with their resounding defeat in November, which saw the party lose ground with almost every demographic across the country. Polling shows public support for the Democrats has slumped to unprecedented lows, with just over a quarter of voters holding a positive view of the party.

Most dramatically, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer defied fellow Democrats (including Jeffries) by voting in favour of a resolution in recent weeks to avoid a government shutdown. His decision sparked an uproar from his party colleagues.

Visual images of the party’s disarray were also on clear display during Trump’s joint address to Congress earlier this month. While some representatives protested loudly, others followed leadership instruction to remain silent.

Democrats were in near lock-step on almost all issues during Trump’s first term, as well as Biden’s presidency. Now, some are calling on Schumer to step aside as minority leader — and for the Democrats to coalesce behind a younger, more outspoken leader such as Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Where next for the party?

In the fractious debates now consuming the party, some see parallels with the emergence of the Tea Party movement within the Republican Party during Barack Obama’s first term in office.

The current Democratic division could result in the emergence of a stronger dissident faction within the party. And this could push a harder line in opposition to Trump, no longer toeing the line from party leadership.

Yet, while the political outlook for Democrats may appear bleak, electoral turnarounds can happen quickly in the United States.

Few expected a demoralised Democratic party to turn John Kerry’s heavy defeat to George W Bush in 2004 into a generational victory just four years later. Similarly, after Obama decisively won reelection against Mitt Romney in 2012, few Republicans could have predicted they’d soon be back in power with Trump.

But, as was the case 20 years ago, the soul-searching process will be painful for the Democrats. Whether it’s Ocasio-Cortez or another figure, the 2026 midterm elections are likely to be the best opportunity for a new central leader to emerge on the national stage.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,"Ten years after the Modern Slavery Act, why has this ‘world-leading’ legislation had so little impact?",https://theconversation.com/ten-years-after-the-modern-slavery-act-why-has-this-world-leading-legislation-had-so-little-impact-252316,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:31:09 GMT","The UK’s 2015 Modern Slavery Act is ten years old on March 26. When it was passed, it was billed as “world-leading” legislation – the first of its kind to introduce a dedicated legal framework to deal with modern slavery.

But ten years on, the evidence tells a different story. The numbers of people identified as potential victims are higher than they have ever been. Yet very few people have been prosecuted. What went wrong with this “groundbreaking” law?

The Modern Slavery Act was the final piece of legislation under the 2010-15 coalition government. Championed by then home secretary Theresa May, the act was primarily about beefing up the criminal justice approach. While criminal offences like human trafficking, forced labour, slavery and servitude were previously dealt with in different pieces of legislation, the act consolidated them into one place.

The aim was to make it easier to identify and prosecute traffickers (who May referred to as “the slave-drivers”), while offering some protection to their victims.

It also included a role for the private sector through a “transparency” clause. This required bigger businesses to report what they are doing to prevent modern slavery in their supply chains. And, it created an Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner to “encourage good practice”. Other new measures included a legal defence to victims who had been forced to commit crimes, and giving law enforcement new powers to confiscate assets from traffickers.

However, the act did little to stop modern slavery happening in the first place. The prevention strategy mainly consisted of poster campaigns in airports and immigration processing centres.

Some argued that the act dodged the big issues around work and immigration. For example, by not addressing weaknesses in labour protections and the additional vulnerabilities migrant workers faced thanks to May’s “hostile environment” migration policies.

As prime minister, May touted the UK’s “world-leading” efforts on modern slavery to the global stage at the UN General Assembly. But a decade later, the impacts have been less than stellar.

What has been its impact?

The act has certainly raised the issue’s profile in the last ten years. Businesses now have to report on what steps they are taking to tackle modern slavery. But there are no penalties if they do not comply, and there has been limited progress on exploitation in supply chains. Recent cases involving McDonald’s and other supermarkets prove that businesses are not spotting the signs or acting effectively to prevent the issue.

The number of people identified as potential victims of modern slavery has increased significantly in the last ten years: 19,125 in 2024, nearly six times as many as in 2015. That’s at least partly because the act has improved awareness among frontline responders (organisations who refer potential victims for support).

But while more people who may have experienced modern slavery are being identified, prosecutions are very low. Only 64 adult offenders were sentenced between 2017-19 for over 22,756 potential victims of modern slavery identified over the same period. There are many reasons for this, but one is that victims may not come forward, fearing they may be detained or deported.

Immigration policies passed by the last Conservative government have also rolled back protections for modern slavery victims. In passing the Nationality and Borders Act and Illegal Migration Act, the government argued that people arriving on small boats were abusing the protections offered through the Modern Slavery Act to evade deportation. Far from world-leading, the UK became non-compliant with international anti-trafficking and human rights laws.

Many of the concerns raised during the drafting of the legislation have proven accurate. Despite repeated commitments to create a unified labour inspectorate, successive governments have dodged reform of labour market regulation.

The UK’s immigration and work visa system has also led to the potential for exploitation. Even legal migration routes and the sponsorship visa scheme have created conditions for people to be exploited. For example, in sectors such as agriculture or social care, where intermediaries sell false promises regarding employment and conditions in the UK.

Added to this, the system of support which recognised victims of modern slavery can access is creaking under pressure. It has expanded beyond what was envisaged in its original design, and there are backlogs in decision-making and questions over how appropriate it is. Thousands have declined formal identification and support because they do not feel it is worthwhile or appropriate for them.

Research has also shown that victims are not necessarily getting the support or legal defence they are entitled to. An unknown number of victims are likely to be in the UK’s prisons, where they may be subject to further exploitation.

Stopping modern slavery

The theory behind the Modern Slavery Act was that if you “get tough” on criminals and improve support for victims, you can reduce exploitation. But that hasn’t worked – modern slavery is still a huge problem in the UK.

Changing this means taking prevention seriously, and addressing the conditions and inequalities that lead to exploitation in the first place. Like other global challenges, modern slavery stems from issues like poverty, inequality and discrimination and gender-based violence.

My colleagues and I at the Modern Slavery and Human Rights Policy and Evidence Centre recently noted in our report on policy priorities that the government has an opportunity to prevent modern slavery through some of its other crime prevention efforts, as well as in forthcoming legislation such as the employment rights bill.

Without a clear and evidence-based strategy, modern slavery in the UK will persist or even grow, and the Modern Slavery Act will remain an innovative, but ultimately ineffective tool in the fight against exploitation.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,The peculiar Turkish corruption issue behind Istanbul mayor’s arrest – and how it became a tool of political oppression,https://theconversation.com/the-peculiar-turkish-corruption-issue-behind-istanbul-mayors-arrest-and-how-it-became-a-tool-of-political-oppression-252933,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:31:17 GMT","Turkey is in turmoil after Istanbul’s mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, a leading opposition figure and potential challenger to Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, was arrested on March 19 on charges of corruption.

More than 1,000 people who protested against the arrest have also been detained as hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in anger at what they say is a major blow against democracy. İmamoğlu, who denies all charges against him, has since been endorsed as the candidate for the 2028 presidential elections for the Republican People’s Party (CHP).

Central to the allegations of corruption is what is known in Turkey as “naylon faturacılık”. This literally means “nylon invoicing” and refers to the issuing of fake invoices. It doesn’t refer to simple clerical errors or accounting mishaps, but deliberate attempts to fabricate transactions, inflate expenses, or obscure real beneficiaries.

Technically illegal, the practice is nonetheless widespread in Turkey. It forms part of what many see as the country’s informal economy.

The informal economy in Turkey spans everything from street vending and informal recycling to complex tax evasion schemes involving registered firms. Naylon faturacılık illustrates how corruption doesn’t always sit outside the system, but often thrives from within it.

It exposes a blurry boundary between formal and informal economic activity, revealing how some formal businesses manipulate legal frameworks to appear compliant while engaging in illicit practices. In September 2024, Turkey’s Ministry of Finance uncovered 3 billion Turkish Lira (£61 million) worth of fake invoices in an investigation targeting around 4,500 large taxpayers.

Over the past four years, I’ve interviewed more than 60 business owners, workers, and entrepreneurs across Turkey – from informal micro-enterprises to firms embedded in formal supply chains. One theme surfaced again and again: naylon faturacılık, or fake invoicing.

People described it not as an exception but as “just part of doing business” in an informal economy. In an economy shaped by patchy enforcement and institutional fragility, this practice has become normalised over the past decade. It’s not legally accepted, but has unfortunately become socially expected.

Under Turkish law, issuing or using fake invoices is a serious offence, punishable by three to eight years in prison. Yet many of my interviewees, especially those operating in or alongside the informal economy, saw fake invoicing as a necessary way of doing business. They described it as a viable response to rising costs, bureaucratic hurdles and a system that often punishes formality.

Opposition leaders, including CHP leader Özgür Özel, argue that İmamoğlu’s arrest is politically motivated – an attempt to discredit their candidate ahead of the presidential election. Özel condemned the operation as a “coup attempt” against Turkey’s democratic future.

In a press conference, he revealed that most of the people detained alongside İmamoğlu are linked to companies that won public contracts from the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (İBB) under the control of İmamoğlu. Moreover, some of those arrested, he claimed, are students or relatives with no actual involvement in procurement decisions or public bids.

The key accusation is that these companies issued fake invoices – billing for work never done, or for services exaggerated or duplicated. Yet Özel contends that no concrete evidence has been presented thus far and much of the government’s case comprises testimony and vague associations from gizli tanık (secret witnesses).

One such witness reportedly named a communications or media firm that had worked with both İBB and the central government – including on campaigns commissioned by the presidency’s Directorate of Communications that work directly with Erdoğan. When the same activity, individuals or businesses, can be framed as legitimate under one administration and criminal under another, the line between legality and politics becomes dangerously thin.

D. Canales Carvajal/Alamy Live News

While opposition mayors in Turkey face swift legal action against corruption, serious corruption allegations against former Ankara mayor Melih Gökçek, which he denies, involving nearly 46 billion Turkish lira in public losses remain uninvestigated. Gökçek was a member of Erdoğan’s government Justice and Development Party (AK).

A total of 97 complaints were filed over alleged misconduct during Gökçek’s tenure as mayor of Ankara until 2017, but nothing was done. Critics say this reflects politically selective justice.

One law for some

This isn’t just a story about fake invoices. It is about contexts where rules are unevenly enforced, where legal grey zones are abundant and where informality becomes a flexible instrument of control. A practice such as naylon faturacılık tolerated in one political moment can become a liability in another. A company can operate legally while it enjoys good relations with the government – and suddenly find itself under suspicion when that changes.

In Turkey today, the question is often not whether an act is legal or illegal. It’s more about who is involved and whose power is being threatened. The lines between formal, informal or illegal is not merely economic – it is profoundly political. That’s why the nylon invoicing issue is so revealing. Far from being a fringe practice, it exposes the everyday intersections of power, legitimacy and corruption.

In a climate of deepening polarisation and eroding institutional trust, many believe that who gets punished for corruption depends less on the act itself and more on which side of the political divide they fall.

Turkey’s democracy and justice system are being tested – not only by corruption, but by how selectively corruption is investigated and enforced. In this uncertain moment, the challenge is not only to hold people accountable, but to rebuild trust in institutions and ensure that justice is applied fairly. The protestors’ slogan “hak, hukuk, adalet” (rights, law, justice) carries a deeper warning: power is temporary, but justice must endure.

As many demonstrators in Turkey are now reminding the Erdoğan government: when the balance shifts, those in power today may find themselves in need of the very fair and independent legal system they are now so determined to undermine.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Synchronised bleaching: Ningaloo and the Great Barrier Reef are bleaching in unison for the first time,https://theconversation.com/synchronised-bleaching-ningaloo-and-the-great-barrier-reef-are-bleaching-in-unison-for-the-first-time-252906,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 05:09:08 GMT","This summer, an intense marine heatwave struck off northwestern Australia, driving sea surface temperatures up to 4°C above the summer average. The large mass of warm water has slowly moved south from the Kimberley region and through the Pilbara, leaving a wave of underwater destruction behind. Now Ningaloo Reef is bleaching in earnest.

The Great Barrier Reef is bleaching too in the waters from Cape York down to Townsville.

This appears to be the first time these two World Heritage-listed reefs have bleached in unison. Bleaching may also hit the World Heritage reef at Shark Bay in Western Australia.

How bad is it? I have just returned from Ningaloo Reef, where I saw widespread bleaching and the first signs of coral mortality. Up to 90% of the coral found in shallow areas of the northern lagoon had bleached. Bleaching doesn’t automatically mean death, but it severely weakens the coral and jeopardises survival.

At Ningaloo and further south, the heatwave is still unfolding. In coming months, we can expect to see some coral mortality, while other corals will survive the bleaching in poor health only to succumb to disease or other threats such as Drupella (coral-eating snails). Other corals may survive but struggle to reproduce, but some particularly hardy corals with the right combination of genes for surviving this event are expected to live on.

Why is this happening? No surprises here: our greenhouse gas emissions trap more heat in the atmosphere. Over 90% of the heat pours into the oceans, pushing surface and deep water temperatures higher for longer periods of time.

How bad has the heat been?

Coral can tolerate brief periods of higher temperatures. But in response to prolonged heat stress, coral polyps expel their symbiotic zooxanthellae algae. They appear to do this to avoid further tissue damage from toxic reactive oxygen molecules which build up as the coral begins to stress. But these microalgae supply sugary food to the coral polyps in exchange for a home. Without these nutrients, the coral can starve.

Heat stress is tracked using a measure called “degree heating weeks” (DHW) – essentially, how much above-average heat has built up in an area over the previous three months. Bleaching can begin at four DWH, while eight DHW can kill some corals.

At Ningaloo, the heat has been off the charts – levels of up to 16 DHW have been recorded, the highest on record for this location.

On the Great Barrier Reef, bleaching is underway in the northernmost section. This is the sixth bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef this decade. Early data suggests there is severe heat in places, ranging from six to 13 DHW in intensity and alerts remain for more heat and bleaching to come.

Bleaching is usually worst for corals growing in shallow water, such as the calm lagoons created by fringing or barrier reefs. Lagoons often have clear waters with high light penetration and limited flushing of water.

Ningaloo in hot water

Over ten days, we recorded the health and type of every coral we saw at 21 sites along Ningaloo Reef, from Coral Bay to the northern tip of North West Cape and into Exmouth Gulf.

The worst affected area that we observed was a 30 km stretch at the northern end of the North West Cape, the peninsula along which Ningaloo Reef runs. Here, we saw mass bleaching – up to 90% of corals partly or fully bleaching and some corals were already dying.

Fast-growing corals from the Acroporid and Pocilloporid families were hard hit, as often seen in other bleaching events. But we also saw slower-growing and normally hardy corals bleaching, such Lobophyllia, Favites and Goniastrea.

Even the massive Porites corals in the lagoons were suffering. These giant boulder-like corals are the old growth and sentinels of the reef. Many of these ordinarily resilient corals are hundreds of years old and have survived past smaller bleaching events. But this time, they too are severely suffering.

Not even ocean-facing corals exposed to more water flow were safe. We found 30 to 50% of the corals on the reef slope were bleached to some degree. Coral diseases such as white band disease were already affecting many flat plate corals. These diseases often follow marine heatwaves, as they take advantage of coral’s weakened immune systems and the disruption of the symbiotic relationship between coral polyps and their algae.

David Juszkiewicz , Author provided (no reuse)

The timing is especially bad for Ningaloo’s corals, which usually spawn around five days after the March full moon, which fell on March 19 this year. By contrast, corals on the Great Barrier Reef tend to spawn between October and December.

For the reef to recover quickly, it needs yearly influxes of new coral recruits. But if corals are struggling to survive, there is a risk they will not be fit enough to reproduce. Corals take three to six years to become reproductively viable and if bleaching impedes reproduction, it could greatly reduce the number of larvae available to replenish the reef. In addition to that, if immature corals bleach and die, there’s a risk several generations of corals could be lost before reaching maturity.

Fortunately we did observe healthy and reproductive corals along the outer rim of the lagoon at Coral Bay, and locals have recently reported seeing spawning near Coral Bay. This suggests some coral were indeed healthy enough to spawn.

What will happen next?

As the southern hemisphere heads towards winter, the oceans will begin to cool off. That doesn’t mean the threat is over – oceans are only getting hotter.

If we continue on our current path, simultaneous east and west coast bleaching events could become the new normal – and that would be devastating for our reefs, marine biodiversity, the blue economy and the wellbeing of Australians.",theconversation

She described seeing him rape her best friend and then smash her skull with a rock.

When Eileen testified at her father’s trial, her memory of the murder was relatively fresh. It was less than a year old. Yet the murder happened 20 years earlier, when she was 8 years old.

How can you have a one-year-old memory of something that happened 20 years ago? According to the prosecution, Eileen repressed her memory of the murder. Then much later she recovered it in complete detail.

Can a memory of something so harrowing disappear for two decades and then resurface in a reliable form?

This case launched a huge debate between memory researchers like me who argue there is no credible scientific evidence that repressed memories exist and practicing clinicians who claim that repressed memories are real.

This controversy is not merely an academic one. Real people’s lives have been shattered by newly recollected traumatic experiences from childhood. I’ve seen this firsthand as a memory expert who consults on legal cases involving defendants accused of crimes they allegedly committed years or even decades ago. Often the only evidence linking the defendant to the crime is a recovered memory.

But the scientific community disagrees about the existence of the phenomenon of repressed memory.

Freud was the father of repression

Nineteenth-century psychoanalytic theorist Sigmund Freud developed the concept of repression. He considered it a defense mechanism people use to protect themselves from traumatic experiences that become too overwhelming.

The idea is that repression buries memories of trauma in your unconscious, where they – unlike other memories – reside unknown to you. They remain hidden, in a pristine, fixed form.

In Freud’s view, repressed memories make themselves known by leaking out in mental and physical symptoms – symptoms that can be relieved only through recovering the traumatic memory in a safe psychological environment.

In the 1980s, increasing numbers of therapists became concerned about the prevalence of child sexual abuse and the historical tendencies to dismiss or hide the maltreatment of children. This shift gave new life to the concept of repression.

Rise of repressed memory recovery

Therapists in this camp told clients that their symptoms, such as anxiety, depression or eating disorders, were the result of repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse that needed to be remembered to heal. To recover these memories, therapists used a range of techniques such as hypnosis, suggestive questioning, repeated imagining, bodywork and group sessions.

Did recovered-memory therapy work? Many people who entered therapy for common mental health issues did come out with new and unexpected memories of childhood sexual abuse and other trauma, without physical evidence or corroboration from others.

But were these memories real?

The notion of repressed memories runs counter to decades of scientific evidence demonstrating that traumatic events tend to be very well remembered over long intervals of time. Many victims of documented trauma, ranging from the Holocaust to combat exposure, torture and natural disasters, do not appear to be able to block out their memories.

In fact, trauma sometimes is too well remembered, as in the case of post-traumatic stress disorder. Recurrent and intrusive traumatic memories are a core symptom of PTSD.

No memory ≠ repressed memory

There are times when victims of trauma may not remember what happened. But this doesn’t necessarily mean the memory has been repressed. There are a range of alternative explanations for not remembering traumatic experiences.

Trauma, like anything you experience, can be forgotten as the result of memory decay. Details fade with time, and retrieving the right remnants of experience becomes increasingly difficult if not impossible.

Someone might make the deliberate choice to not think about upsetting events. Psychologists call this motivated forgetting or suppression.

There also are biological causes of forgetting such as brain injury and substance abuse.

Trauma also can interfere with the making of a memory in the first place. When stress becomes too big or too prolonged, attention can shift from the experience itself to attempts to regulate emotion, endure what’s happening or even survive. This narrow focus can result in little to no memory of what happened.

False memories

If science rejects the notion of repressed memories, there’s still one question to confront: Where do newly recollected trauma memories, such as those triggered in recovered-memory therapy, come from?

All memories are subject to distortions when you mistakenly incorporate expectations, assumptions or information from others that was not part of the original event.

Memory researchers contend that memory recovery techniques might actually create false memories of things that never happened rather than resurrect existing memories of real experiences.

To study this possibility, researchers asked participants to elaborate on events that never happened using the same sorts of suggestive questioning techniques used by recovered-memory therapists.

What they found was startling. They were able to induce richly detailed false memories of a wide range of childhood traumatic experiences, such as choking, hospitalization and being a victim of a serious animal attack, in almost one-third of participants.

These researchers were intentionally planting false memories. But I don’t think intention would be necessary on the part of a sympathetic therapist working with a suffering client.

Are the memory wars over?

The belief in repressed memories remains well entrenched among the general public and mental health professionals. More than half believe that traumatic experiences can become repressed in the unconscious, where they lurk, waiting to be uncovered.

This remains the case even though in his later work, Freud revised his original concept of repression to argue that it doesn’t work on actual memories of experiences, but rather involves the inhibition of certain impulses, desires and fantasies. This revision rarely makes it into popular conceptions of repression.

As evidence of the current widespread belief in repressed memories, in the past few years several U.S. states and European countries have extended or abolished the statute of limitations for the prosecution of sexual crimes, which allows for testimony based on allegedly recovered memories of long-ago crimes.

Given the ease with which researchers can create false childhood memories, one of the unforeseen consequences of these changes is that falsely recovered memories of abuse might find their way into court – potentially leading to unfounded accusations and wrongful convictions.",theconversation

Since 2022, Congress has provided about US$174 billion to Ukraine and neighboring countries to assist its war effort. Trump inflated this figure to $350 billion in a March 2025 White House meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. Separately, he has suggested Ukraine could reimburse the U.S. by giving America access to its minerals.

Ukraine is rich in titanium, graphite, manganese and other rare earth metals used to produce electric vehicle batteries and other tech devices.

Mining and refining these critical mineral resources would require major investment in infrastructure and economic development, including in parts of Ukraine severely damaged by fighting. Some analysts are calling for a return to the European Recovery Program, commonly known as the Marshall Plan.

The Marshall Plan used $13.3 billion in U.S. funds – roughly $171 billion in today’s dollars – to rebuild war-torn Western Europe from 1948 to late 1951. It is often evoked as a solution for reconstruction following global crises. Yet as a military historian and curator, I find that the Marshall Plan is not well understood.

For the U.S., the economic gains of the Marshall Plan did not come from European countries’ repaying loans or allowing the U.S. to extract their raw materials. Rather, the U.S. has benefited enormously from a half-century of goodwill, democratic stability and economic success in Europe.

European nations turn inward

After World War II ended in 1945, Western Europe faced a staggering burden of destruction and upheaval.

Allied bombardment of major industrial areas and German cities such as Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne had created massive housing shortages. Meanwhile, fighting through agricultural areas and a critical manpower shortage had curtailed food production. What harvest there was could not get to hungry civilians because so many of Europe’s roads, bridges and ports had been destroyed.

The United Kingdom, Italy, France, Germany and other European governments were buried in debt after so many years of war. They could not afford to rebuild on their own. Yet rather than cooperating on their mutual economic reconstruction, European nations looked inward, focusing primarily on their own political challenges.

The continent was politically and militarily divided, too. Europe’s western half was influenced by the democratic, capitalistic forces led by the U.S. Eastern Europe was beholden to the communist, command-economy forces of the Soviet Union.

In a 1946 speech at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill articulated Europe’s growing postwar divide. Over the ruins of proud nations, he said, “an iron curtain” had “descended across the continent.”

US looks abroad

Unlike Europe, the U.S. emerged from World War II as the wealthiest nation in the world, with its territory intact and unharmed. Its steel and oil industries were booming. By 1947, the U.S. was the clear successor to Great Britain as the world’s superpower.

But President Harry Truman feared the ambitions of the war’s other great victor – the Soviet Union. In March 1947, he announced a new doctrine to contain communist expansion southward across Europe by giving $400 million in military and economic aid to Greece and Turkey.

Around the same time, U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall met with Soviet officials to plan Germany’s future. Following the Nazis’ surrender in May 1945, Germany had been divided into four occupied zones administered by U.S., British, French and Soviet forces.

Each nation had its own goals for its section of Germany. The U.S. wanted to revitalize Germany politically and economically, believing that a moribund Germany would thwart the economic reconstruction of all of Europe.

Marshall hoped that the Soviets would cooperate, but Soviet ruler Josef Stalin preferred extracting reparations from a prostrate Germany to investing in its recovery. A vibrant German economic engine, the Soviets felt, could just as easily rearm to attack the Russian countryside for the third time that century.

The Truman administration chose to unilaterally rebuild the three western Allied sectors of Germany – and Western Europe.

Marshall outlined his plan at a commencement address at Harvard University in June 1947. American action to restore global economic health, he said, would provide the foundation for political stability and peace in Europe. And an economically healthy Western Europe, in turn, would inhibit the spread of communism by plainly demonstrating the benefits of capitalism.

“Our policy is not directed against any country,” Marshall said, “but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos.”

Marshall’s plan

Marshall invited all European nations to participate in drafting a plan to first address the immediate humanitarian aid of Europe’s people, then rebuild its infrastructure. The U.S. would pay for it all.

For nearly bankrupt European nations, it was a lifeline.

In September 1947, the new Committee for European Economic Co-operation, composed of 16 Western – but not Eastern – European nations, delivered its proposal to Washington.

It would take a masterful legislative strategy for the Democratic Truman administration to persuade the Republican-led Congress to pass this $13 billion bill. It succeeded thanks to the dedicated effort of Republican Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, who convinced his isolationist colleagues that the Marshall Plan would halt the expansion of communism and benefit American economic growth.

In April 1948, Truman signed the Economic Cooperation Act. By year’s end, over $2 billion had reached Europe, and its industrial production had finally surpassed prewar levels seen in 1939.

NATO is born

Along with economic stability, the Truman administration recognized that Europe needed military security to defend against communist encroachment by the Soviet Union.

In July 1949, 12 European countries, the U.S. and Canada established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. NATO committed each member country to the mutual defense of fellow NATO members.

Since 1947, NATO has steadily expanded eastward to include Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and other former Soviet satellite states directly bordering Russia.

Ukraine, which declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, is not yet a NATO member. But it desperately wants to be.

Ukraine applied for NATO membership in 2022 after Russia’s invasion. Its application is pending. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said any peace deal with Ukraine must bar NATO membership.

Would a Marshall Plan work for Ukraine?

Modern-day Ukraine mirrors the Western European countries of the Marshall Plan era in meaningful ways.

It suffers from the physical devastation of war, with its major cities heavily damaged. The threat of military attack from hostile neighbors remains urgent. And it has a functional, democratic government that would – in peacetime – be capable of receiving and distributing aid to develop the nation’s economic growth and stability.

U.S. global leadership, however, has changed dramatically since 1948.

Outright American taxpayer financing of Ukraine’s reconstruction seems impossible. Any plan to reconstruct the country after war will likely require public funding from multiple nations and substantial private investment. That private investment could well include mineral extraction and refinement ventures.

Ultimately, Ukraine’s recovery will most likely involve Ukraine and neighboring nations reaching agreement to restore its economic and military security. The European Union, which Ukraine also seeks to join, has the bureaucratic and economic resources necessary to reconstruct Ukraine, restore peace and ease tensions on the continent.

Any future Marshall Plan for Ukraine will probably be European.",theconversation

But over time, the microbes responsible for these infections have evolved to evade the very drugs designed to eliminate them.

Each year, there are more than 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections in the United States, leading to over 35,000 deaths and US$4.6 billion in health care costs. As antibiotics become less effective, antimicrobial resistance poses an increasing threat to public health.

Antimicrobial resistance began to emerge as a serious threat in the 1940s with the rise of penicillin resistance. By the 1990s, it had escalated into a global concern. Decades later, critical questions still remain: How does antimicrobial resistance emerge, and how can scientists track the hidden changes leading to it? Why does resistance in some microbes remain undetected until an outbreak occurs? Filling these knowledge gaps is crucial to preventing future outbreaks, improving treatment outcomes and saving lives.

Over the years, my work as a microbiologist and biomedical scientist has focused on investigating the genetics of infectious microbes. My colleagues and I identified a resistance gene previously undetected in the U.S. using genetic and computational methods that can help improve how scientists detect and track antimicrobial resistance.

Challenges of detecting resistance

Antimicrobial resistance is a natural process where microbes constantly evolve as a defense mechanism, acquiring genetic changes that enhance their survival.

Unfortunately, human activities can speed up this process. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in health care, farming and the environment push bacteria to genetically change in ways that allow them to survive the drugs meant to kill them.

Early detection of antimicrobial resistance is crucial for effective treatment. Surveillance typically begins with a laboratory sample obtained from patients with suspected infections, which is then analyzed to identify potential antimicrobial resistance. Traditionally, this has been done using culture-based methods that involve exposing microbes to antibiotics in the lab and observing whether they survived to determine whether they were becoming resistant. Along with helping authorities and researchers monitor the spread of antimicrobial resistance, hospitals use this approach to decide on treatment plans.

However, culture-based approaches have some limitations. Resistant infections often go unnoticed until antibiotics fail, making both detection and intervention processes slow. Additionally, new resistance genes may escape detection altogether.

Genomics of antimicrobial resistance

To overcome these challenges, researchers have integrated genomic sequencing into antimicrobial resistance surveillance. Through whole-genome sequencing, we can analyze all the DNA in a microbial sample to get a comprehensive view of all the genes present – including those responsible for resistance. With the computational tools of bioinformatics, researchers can efficiently process vast amounts of genetic data to improve the detection of resistance threats.

Despite its advantages, integrating genomic sequencing into antimicrobial resistance monitoring presents some challenges of its own. High costs, quality assurance and a shortage of trained bioinformaticians make implementation difficult. Additionally, the complexity of interpreting genomic data may limit its use in clinical and public health decision-making.

Establishing international standards could help make whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatics a fully reliable tool for resistance surveillance. The World Health Organization recommends laboratories follow strict quality control measures to ensure accurate and comparable results. This includes using reliable, user-friendly computational tools and shared microbial databases. Additional strategies include investing in training programs and fostering collaborations between hospitals, research labs and universities.

Discovering a resistance gene

Combining whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics, my colleagues and I analyzed Salmonella samples collected from several animal species between 1982 and 1999. We discovered a Salmonella resistance gene called blaSCO-1 that has evaded detection in U.S. livestock for decades.

The blaSCO-1 gene confers resistance to microbes against several critical antibiotics, including ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and, to some extent, cephalosporins and carbapenems. These medications are crucial for treating infections in both humans and animals.

The blaSCO-1 gene likely remained unreported because routine surveillance usually targets well-known resistance genes and it has overlapping functions with other genes. Gaps in bioinformatics expertise may have also hindered its identification.

The failure to detect genes like blaSCO-1 raises concern about its potential role in past treatment failures. Between 2015 and 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began implementing whole-genome sequencing for routine surveillance of Salmonella. Studies conducted during this period found that 77% of multistate outbreaks were linked to livestock harboring resistant Salmonella.

These missed genes have significant implications for both food safety and public health. Undetected antimicrobial resistance genes can spread through food animals, contaminated food products, processing environments and agricultural runoff, allowing resistant bacteria to persist and reach humans. These resistant bacteria lead to infections that are harder to treat and increase the risk of outbreaks. Moreover, the global movement of people, livestock and goods means that these resistant strains can easily cross borders, turning local outbreaks into worldwide health threats.

Identifying new resistance genes not only fills a critical knowledge gap, but it also demonstrates how genomic and computational approaches can help detect hidden resistance mechanisms before they pose widespread threats.

Strengthening surveillance

As antimicrobial resistance continues to rise, adopting a One Health approach that integrates human, animal and environmental factors can help ensure that emerging resistance does not outpace humans’ ability to combat it.

Initiatives like the Quadripartite AMR Multi-Partner Trust Fund provide support for programs that strengthen global collaborative surveillance, promote responsible antimicrobial use and drive the development of sustainable alternatives. Ensuring researchers around the world follow common research standards will allow more labs – especially those in low- and middle-income countries – to contribute to global surveillance efforts.

The health of future generations depends on the world’s ability to ensure food safety and protect public health on a global scale. In the ongoing battle between microbial evolution and human innovation, vigilance and adaptability are key to staying ahead.",theconversation

How many types of insects are there in the world? – Sawyer, age 8, Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina

Exploring anywhere on Earth, look closely and you’ll find insects. Check your backyard and you may see ants, beetles, crickets, wasps, mosquitoes and more. There are more kinds of insects than there are mammals, birds and plants combined. This fact has fascinated scientists for centuries.

One of the things biologists like me do is classify all living things into categories. Insects belong to a phylum called Arthropoda – animals with hard exoskeletons and jointed feet.

All insects are arthropods, but not all arthropods are insects. For instance, spiders, lobsters and millipedes are arthropods, but they’re not insects.

Instead, insects are a subgroup within Arthropoda, a class called “Insecta,” that is characterized by six legs, two antennae and three body segments – head, abdomen and the thorax, which is the part of the body between the head and abdomen.

Most insects also have wings, although a few, like fleas, don’t. All have compound eyes, which means insects see very differently from the way people see. Instead of one lens per eye, they have many: a fly has 5,000 lenses; a dragonfly has 30,000. These types of eyes, though not great for clarity, are excellent at detecting movement.

What is a species?

All insects descend from a common ancestor that lived about about 480 million years ago. For context, that’s about 100 million years before any of our vertebrate ancestors – animals with a backbone – ever walked on land.

A species is the most basic unit that biologists use to classify living things. When people use words like “ant” or “fly” or “butterfly” they are referring not to species, but to categories that may contain hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of species. For example, about 18,000 species of butterfly exist – think monarch, zebra swallowtail or cabbage white.

Basically, species are a group that can interbreed with each other, but not with other groups. One obvious example: bees can’t interbreed with ants.

But brown-belted bumblebees and red-belted bumblebees can’t interbreed either, so they are different species of bumblebee.

Each species has a unique scientific name – like Bombus griseocollis for the brown-belted bumblebee – so scientists can be sure which species they’re talking about.

Quadrillions of ants

Counting the exact number of insect species is probably impossible. Every year, some species go extinct, while some evolve anew. Even if we could magically freeze time and survey the entire Earth all at once, experts would disagree on the distinctiveness or identity of some species. So instead of counting, researchers use statistical analysis to make an estimate.

One scientist did just that. He published his answer in a 2018 research paper. His calculations showed there are approximately 5.5 million insect species, with the correct number almost certainly between 2.6 and 7.2 million.

Beetles alone account for almost one-third of the number, about 1.5 million species. By comparison, there are “only” an estimated 22,000 species of ants. This and other studies have also estimated about 3,500 species of mosquitoes, 120,000 species of flies and 30,000 species of grasshoppers and crickets.

The estimate of 5.5 million species of insects is interesting. What’s even more remarkable is that because scientists have found only about 1 million species, that means more than 4.5 million species are still waiting for someone to discover them. In other words, over 80% of the Earth’s insect biodiversity is still unknown.

Add up the total population and biomass of the insects, and the numbers are even more staggering. The 22,000 species of ants comprise about 20,000,000,000,000,000 individuals – that’s 20 quadrillion ants. And if a typical ant weighs about 0.0001 ounces (3 milligrams) – or one ten-thousandth of an ounce – that means all the ants on Earth together weigh more than 132 billion pounds (about 60 billion kilograms).

That’s the equivalent of about 7 million school buses, 600 aircraft carriers or about 20% of the weight of all humans on Earth combined.

Many insect species are going extinct

All of this has potentially huge implications for our own human species. Insects affect us in countless ways. People depend on them for crop pollination, industrial products and medicine. Other insects can harm us by transmitting disease or eating our crops.

Most insects have little to no direct impact on people, but they are integral parts of their ecosystems. This is why entomologists – bug scientists – say we should leave insects alone as much as possible. Most of them are harmless to people, and they are critical to the environment.

It is sobering to note that although millions of undiscovered insect species may be out there, many will go extinct before people have a chance to discover them. Largely due to human activity, a significant proportion of Earth’s biodiversity – including insects – may ultimately be forever lost.

https://theconversation.com,"How Japanese anime draws on religious traditions to explore themes of destiny, sacrifice and the struggle between desire and duty",https://theconversation.com/how-japanese-anime-draws-on-religious-traditions-to-explore-themes-of-destiny-sacrifice-and-the-struggle-between-desire-and-duty-246960,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:47:59 GMT","I have spent years studying and teaching Japanese anime, exploring how its narratives intertwine with cultural, philosophical and religious traditions. One of the most compelling aspects of Japanese anime is its ability to merge thrilling action with deep spiritual and ethical questions.

“Demon Slayer: Mugen Train,” which shattered Japanese box-office records for earnings and ended up as 2020’s highest-grossing film in the world, is a prime example of how anime engages with these profound themes. With “Demon Slayer” continuing its global success, it is an opportune time to examine how it intertwines Buddhist, Shinto and samurai traditions into a narrative of heroism, impermanence and moral struggle.

Spiritual themes in anime

Anime often explores spiritual and philosophical questions by drawing on Japan’s religious traditions to examine themes of fate, self-sacrifice and the struggle between desire and duty.

Hayao Miyazaki’s “Princess Mononoke,” for example, follows Prince Ashitaka, who is cursed by a demon and must journey to find a cure. His quest leads him into a conflict between the industrialized Irontown, which seeks to expand by clearing forests, and the spirits of the natural world, including the Deer God, a divine being that governs life and death.

The film reflects Shinto principles by portraying nature as sacred and inhabited by “kami,” or spiritual beings. It emphasizes harmony between humans and the environment and the consequences of disrupting this balance.

Scholar Melissa Croteau, in her book “Transcendence and Spirituality in Japanese Cinema,” notes how Miyazaki’s films use nature spirits to critique modernity’s detachment from the sacredness of the environment.

Similarly, his 2001 animated film “Spirited Away” reflects animist ideas in Japanese culture, where spirits are believed to inhabit natural elements and even everyday objects. Set in a mysterious Japanese bathhouse filled with “kami,” 10-year-old Chihiro, once shy and afraid of change, learns to navigate this hidden world and transforms along the way.

A key moment in the film is the arrival of a polluted river spirit, which appears as a filthy, sludge-covered creature but is revealed to be a once-pristine river god, burdened by human waste. This scene embodies the animist belief that natural entities have their own spirit and must be respected. It also reinforces an environmental message: When nature is polluted or mistreated, it loses its vitality, but with care and reverence it can be restored.

“Neon Genesis Evangelion,” a landmark Japanese anime television series that aired from 1995 to 1996, engages with deep philosophical ideas, particularly existentialist questions of identity and purpose. Set in a postapocalyptic world, the series follows 14-year-old Shinji Ikari, who is recruited to pilot a giant biomechanical weapon called an evangelion to defend humanity against mysterious beings known as Angels.

As Shinji and his fellow pilots struggle with their roles, the series explores themes of isolation, self-worth and the challenges of forming close, meaningful relationships. It draws from both Buddhist and Gnostic thought, which emphasize a focus on inner spiritual knowledge and the belief that clinging too tightly to the material world causes suffering. Evangelion portrays suffering as arising from attachment and the inability to form meaningful relationships.

Rengoku: The embodiment of selfless heroism

What sets “Mugen Train” apart is its focus on the internal conflicts of its characters, symbolized by their battles with demons. These demons represent human suffering and attachment, themes deeply influenced by Buddhist thought. At the heart of the film is Kyojuro Rengoku, a demon slayer who embodies unwavering selflessness and honor.

Rengoku’s fire-based fighting style is deeply symbolic. In Japanese culture, fire represents both destruction and renewal. The Kurama Fire Festival, held annually on Oct. 22 in Kyoto, is a Shinto ritual where large torches are carried through the streets to ward off evil and purify the land.

Similarly, Buddhist goma fire ceremonies involve priests burning wooden sticks in sacred flames to symbolize the eradication of ignorance and desire. Rengoku’s own techniques reflect this duality: His flames cleanse the world of evil while signifying his unwavering spirit.

Bushido, the samurai code of honor, underpins Rengoku’s character. Rooted in Confucian ethics, Zen Buddhism and Shinto beliefs, this code emphasizes loyalty, self-sacrifice and duty to protect others. His mother’s teaching – “The strong must protect the weak” – guides his every action, reflecting the Confucian value of filial piety and the moral obligation to serve society.

Bushido’s connection to Zen Buddhism, with its focus on discipline and acceptance of impermanence, further shapes Rengoku’s unwavering resolve, while its Shinto influences reinforce his role as a guardian upholding a sacred duty.

Even approaching death, Rengoku remains steadfast, accepting impermanence, or “mujō,” a fundamental Buddhist principle that sees beauty in life’s transience. His sacrifice teaches that true strength lies in selflessness and moral integrity.

Akaza: A manifestation of attachment and suffering

Opposing Rengoku is Akaza, a demon who embodies the destructive consequences of clinging to power and immortality. Once human, Akaza became a demon in his obsession with strength, unable to accept the impermanence of life.

His refusal to acknowledge death aligns with Buddhist teachings that suffering arises from attachment and desire. Scholars such as Jacqueline Stone have explored how Buddhist texts portray clinging to existence as a fundamental source of suffering, a theme vividly reflected in Akaza’s character.

Visual elements reinforce Akaza’s symbolism. His body is covered in tattoos reminiscent of “irezumi,” traditional Japanese body art historically associated with crime and hardship. In Edo-period Japan, tattoos were often used to mark criminals, branding them as outcasts from society. Even today, irezumi remains stigmatized in many parts of Japan, with some public bathhouses, gyms and swimming pools barring individuals with visible tattoos due to their historical association with the yakuza. In contemporary anime, tattooed characters frequently symbolize a troubled past or inner turmoil, reinforcing Akaza’s role as a figure trapped by his own suffering and destructive path.

Akaza’s irezumi visually conveys his entrapment in cycles of suffering, reinforcing his contrast with Rengoku’s liberating flames.

A battle about human struggles

The battle between Rengoku and Akaza is more than a fight between good and evil; it is a clash between two worldviews – selflessness versus egoism, acceptance versus attachment. “Mugen Train” taps into universal human struggles, making its themes resonate far beyond Japan.

The film’s exploration of impermanence, moral duty and the pursuit of meaning contributes to anime’s broader legacy as a medium that entertains while provoking deep philosophical reflection.

As “Demon Slayer” continues to captivate audiences worldwide, evidenced by social media buzz around its new projects and the ongoing enthusiasm of fans, its success underscores anime’s ability to blend action with profound themes.

Whether through Rengoku’s selfless courage or Akaza’s tragic downfall, “Mugen Train” offers a timeless meditation on what it means to live with purpose and integrity.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,National monuments have grown and shrunk under US presidents for over a century thanks to one law: The Antiquities Act,https://theconversation.com/national-monuments-have-grown-and-shrunk-under-us-presidents-for-over-a-century-thanks-to-one-law-the-antiquities-act-252707,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:47:35 GMT","America’s public lands, from its majestic national parks to its vast national forests, are at the heart of the country’s identity.

They cover more than a quarter of the nation and large parts of the West. Some are crisscrossed by hiking trails and used by hunters and fishermen. Ranchers graze cattle on others. In many areas, the government earns money through oil, gas, timber and mining leases.

These federally managed public lands have long enjoyed broad bipartisan support, as have moves to turn them into protected national parks and monuments. Research consistently shows that a majority of Americans want their congressional representatives to protect public access to these lands for recreation. One avenue for protection is the creation of national monuments.

But the status of national monuments can change.

Presidents have expanded and contracted national monuments, as the U.S. saw with Bears Ears National Monument in Utah over the course of the past three presidencies. The rules for the use and maintenance of various public lands can also change, and that can affect surrounding communities and their economies.

The U.S. is likely to see changes to public lands again under the second Trump administration. One of the new administration’s early orders was for the Department of Interior to review all national monuments for potential oil and gas drilling and mining. At least two national monuments that President Joe Biden created in California are among the new administration’s targets.

The avenue for many of these changes is rooted in one century-old law.

The power and vagary of the Antiquities Act

The Antiquities Act of 1906, signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt, gave Congress or the president the authority to establish national monuments on federal land as a means of protecting areas for ecological, cultural, historical or scientific purposes.

From Theodore Roosevelt on, 18 of the 21 presidents have used the Antiquities Act to create, expand or contract national monuments through a presidential proclamation.

By using the Antiquities Act to create, expand or reduce national monuments, presidents can avoid an environmental impact statement, normally required under the National Environmental Policy Act, which also allows for public input. Supporters argue that forgoing the environmental impact statement helps expedite monument creation and expansion. Critics say bypassing the review means potential impacts of the monument designations can be overlooked.

The Antiquities Act also offers no clarity on whether a president can reduce the amount of area protected by prior presidents. The act simply states that a president designates “the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.” This has led to the shifting of national monument boundaries based on the priorities of each administration.

An example is Bears Ears, an area of Utah that is considered significant to several tribes but also has uranium, gas and oil resources. In 2016, President Barack Obama designated Bears Ears a national monument. In 2017, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation reducing Bears Ears by 80% of its total designated size. The monument’s size and scope shifted a third time when President Joe Biden reestablished Bears Ears to the boundaries designated by Obama.

In the span of just over five years, the monument was created, reduced, then restored to the original monument designation.

The uncertainty about the long-term reliability of a designation makes it challenging for federal agencies to manage the land or assure Indigenous communities that the government will protect cultural, historical and ecological heritage.

Public lands can be economic engines

National parks and monuments can help fuel local economies.

A 2017 study by Headwaters Economics, a nonprofit research group, found that Western rural counties with more public land have had greater economic growth, including in jobs and personal income, than those with little public land. National monuments can also benefit neighboring counties by increasing population, income and employment opportunities.

While many counties adjacent to public lands may be dependent on natural resource extraction, the establishment of a national monument can open up new opportunities by expanding tourism and recreation. For example, four national parks and monuments in southeastern Utah, including Natural Bridges, drew about 2.4 million visitors who spent nearly US$400 million in surrounding communities.

However, when there is uncertainty over whether public lands will remain protected, communities may be hesitant to invest in that future, not knowing whether it will soon change.

What Congress and the courts could do

There are a few ways to increase the certainty around the future of national monuments.

First, lawsuits could push the courts to determine whether the president has the authority to reduce national monuments. Since the Antiquities Act doesn’t directly address presidential authority to reduce monument size, that’s an open question.

Advocacy groups sued the government over Trump’s authority to shrink Bears Ears National Monument, but their cases were put on hold after Biden expanded the monument again. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear other cases in 2024 that argued that a president’s authority to declare and expand national monuments should be far more limited under the law.

Second, Congress could permanently protect designated national monuments through legislation. That would require presidential approval, and the process would likely be slow and cumbersome. Creating White Clouds Wilderness in Idaho, for example, took decades and a public campaign to have it designated a national monument before Congress approved its wilderness designation.

Third, Congress could take new steps to protect public lands. For example, a bipartisan bill titled Public Lands in Public Hands Act could block privatization of public lands and increase and maintain access for recreation. One of the bill’s lead sponsors is U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, a Republican from Montana who served as Interior secretary during the first Trump administration. Whether the bill will pass and gain the president’s approval remains to be seen.

Public lands have widespread support

The Antiquities Act has led to the creation of 163 terrestrial and marine monuments and subsequently the protection of land and waters that hold cultural, scientific or historic significance.

These monuments tend to have broad support. During the first Trump administration, there were over 650,000 public comments on Trump’s review of national monument creation. An analysis found that 98% of the comments expressed broad support for both the creation and expansion of national monuments.

Public lands are more than just physical places. They are spaces where our ideals and values around public land unify us as Americans. They are quintessentially American – and in many ways define and shape the American identity.",theconversation

That’s the key finding of my recent study, published in February 2025 in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy can occur in pregnant or postpartum mothers during late pregnancy up to five months after birth. The disease is difficult to identify and is often misdiagnosed. Multiple studies estimate that 7% to 20% of U.S. mothers who have it don’t survive.

As a nurse scientist with a research focus on maternal health equity, I wanted to learn more about the factors that cause peripartum cardiomyopathy.

My team and I examined more than 7.3 million birth records in California between 1997 and 2019. By using the neighborhood deprivation index, which measures socioeconomic disadvantage in a geographic area, we linked hospital discharge and vital records information up to 12 months postpartum follow-up on each woman. From that data, we developed a more complete picture on why women developed the illness.

We found that living in poor neighborhoods with fewer resources was associated with a 20% to 70% increased risk of developing this disease. Those in the most under-resourced neighborhoods – areas with less access to nutritious food, stable housing and quality health care – had the highest risk. This was true even after accounting for other factors, like income, race, high blood pressure and obesity.

But living in highly stressed neighborhoods explained only part of the reason for the higher rates of peripartum cardiomyopathy in Black women. We found that even if they lived in better neighborhoods, Black women were still more than three times as likely to develop the condition than others.

Why it matters

Our findings suggest deeper issues are contributing to the increase in the disease, particularly in Black women.

Barriers to health care are critical. These include insurance gaps, transportation issues, the biases of doctors and other providers and inadequate access to care.

A better understanding of these factors can help policymakers develop effective interventions for all women at risk and reallocate resources – and dollars – to prevent disparities in maternal health outcomes.

What still isn’t known

Our study only points to neighborhood disinvestment and chronic high blood pressure as contributors to the risk of peripartum cardiomyopathy. Unanswered questions remain about the other causes.

More research is needed to fully understand how social determinants of health, which are the environmental conditions where people are born, live, work and play, affect health outcomes.

For example, these communities are often food deserts – places with limited access to healthy food and larger supermarkets. Overcrowded or poor-quality housing also contribute to stress and health problems. So does the lack of safe space for physical activity.

What’s next

My future work will focus on further identifying the key factors that influence peripartum cardiomyopathy risk, such as economic stability and the effects of environmental stressors, like pollution.

I’ll also track the long-term health of peripartum cardiomyopathy survivors to understand how social factors affect recovery. My ultimate goal is to inform policies and practices that reduce disparities and improve maternal heart health for all.

After becoming Spotify’s most-streamed artist for three years in a row – the first and only artist ever to do so – he sold out all 49 dates of his 2024 U.S. tour, netting US$211 million.

Earlier this year, after Bad Bunny co-hosted “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon” and announced a 21-show residency in Puerto Rico, the recently reelected mayor of San Juan, Miguel Romero, quipped that the artist had done a better job of promoting Puerto Rico than the island’s official destination marketing organization.

That agency, Discover Puerto Rico, was founded in 2017 to market the island to both tourists and investors. Established during the administration of Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, it was part of a broader effort to professionalize Puerto Rico’s place branding and underscored the importance of tourism to the island’s economy.

As a scholar of Puerto Rican politics and place branding – and a native Puerto Rican – I think this case study raises interesting public policy questions: Who gets to brand Puerto Rico? Why does it matter if a place has a brand anyway? And if political leaders are dissatisfied with an agency whose sole purpose is to market the island, what comes next?

It’s not just a place – it’s a brand

Historically, place-branding campaigns have been led by governments seeking to attract tourism and investment. One of the most iconic examples was the “I Love New York” campaign, launched in 1977 as a collaboration between New York City and private partners. Similar public-private models became more common in the decades that followed.

Puerto Rico has seen various branding efforts over the years. Early boosterism efforts emerged during the first half of the 20th century, and in 1970, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company was created to promote the island as a tourist destination. By the 1990s, many Puerto Rican municipalities had begun adopting different place branding strategies.

During Puerto Rico’s deepening fiscal crisis in the 2010s, branding efforts remained a bipartisan priority. But the two dominant political parties – the pro-territory Partido Popular Democrático, and the pro-statehood Partido Nuevo Progresista – each rebranded the island every time a new administration took office, raising concerns about consistency. The last major government-led initiative before Discover Puerto Rico was the “Isla Estrella” campaign, which included a sponsorship deal with Spain’s Sevilla FC soccer team.

The ‘Discover Puerto Rico’ era

In 2017, Discover Puerto Rico took control over the island’s place-branding efforts. However, its performance has been polarizing, with critics pointing to significant blunders. For example, an early ad in its “Live Boricua” campaign sparked backlash for featuring a family that didn’t look like most Puerto Ricans.

Beyond its marketing blunders, Discover Puerto Rico has struggled to navigate Puerto Rico’s politically charged place-branding landscape. In fact, it has been contested from the start, and remains so, as recently elected Gov. Jennifer González evaluates its future. It remains unclear to what extent efficiency and economic development will serve as the main criteria for evaluating its success, and to what extent party politics will influence the decision-making process.

Just a day before Mayor Romero made his remark about Bad Bunny, Discover Puerto Rico’s CEO, Brad Dean, resigned, taking a similar role in St. Louis. Dean has argued that during his tenure, Discover Puerto Rico has driven significant increases in tourism and tourism spending. While these self-reported figures suggest success, they don’t address a critical issue – the long-standing political controversy surrounding Puerto Rico’s branding.

Pop culture carries the weight

At the same time the future of Discover Puerto Rico remains uncertain, the island has gained unparalleled international attention thanks to popular music.

Reggaetón, an urban genre that originated in Puerto Rico in the 1990s, has amassed a massive global fan base, extending beyond Puerto Rico and Latin America to the rest of the world. In 2017, Daddy Yankee and Luis Fonsi’s video for the worldwide hit “Despacito” turned La Perla, a working-class barrio in Old San Juan, into a magnet for tourists from all over the world.

More recently, in January 2025, Bad Bunny released his latest album, “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” which taps into traditional Puerto Rican music genres such as bomba, plena and música jíbara that aren’t usually associated with reggaetón. It charted at No. 1. Bad Bunny also announced a Puerto Rico-exclusive concert series, with some dates reserved for locals and others open to fans worldwide.

The success of Puerto Rican reggaetón artists raises an important question: Why have these organic cultural movements been so effective – perhaps even more so than the official expert-driven place-marketing agency – in promoting Puerto Rico as a brand?

So when the price of eggs rose over 40% from 2024 to 2025, it became a headline news story in Colorado and across the nation.

Public officials and the media blamed high egg prices on bird flu outbreaks and said containing the outbreak in supply chains would lower prices. In early March 2025, egg prices fell in the U.S., but these trends are likely to reverse due to higher seasonal demand during Easter and Passover.

Rising prices and market volatility have led to food costs climbing to 11.4% of American’s disposable income, the largest percentage since 1991.

Arresting these rising costs, as I argue in my 2023 book, means reinventing supply chains to address the growing supply, demand and price volatility that has created uncertainty for consumers since the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.

I have described global supply chains, and supply chains in the U.S. in particular, as “efficiently broken.” By this I mean that they aspire to offer low prices from economies of scale but lack sufficient resiliency to create stability.

Without addressing the systemic weaknesses in supply chains, I believe major health and economic disruptions will continue to happen in Colorado, nationally and around the world.

Cage-free eggs

Colorado faces a double whammy where egg prices are concerned.

It’s one of nine states with a cage-free egg mandate, which requires all eggs sold in the state to come from cage-free facilities. The regulation has been shown to increase the price of eggs by as much as 50%.

Over the past two decades, cage-free egg laws have been passed in states as consumers have grown more concerned with the welfare of farm animals. What that means varies from state to state because the term cage-free isn’t regulated by a federal agency. In Colorado, egg-laying hens must be housed in a cage-free system and must have a minimum of 1 square foot of usable floor space per hen.

Colorado is the 28th largest egg producer in the U.S., far behind Midwestern states such as Iowa, Indiana and Ohio, but it has a few large producers such as Morning Fresh Farms, as well as smaller ones such as the Colorado Egg Producers Association, a collection of seven family-owned farms.

Colorado’s cage-free egg law went into effect in January 2025 – around the same time that consumers noticed bare egg shelves at their supermarkets. Many consumers and some elected Republicans in Colorado blamed the cage-free law.

Nevada is pulling back on its cage-free egg mandate to deal with the challenge of unaffordable egg prices.

But cage-free laws are not the main driver of increasing egg prices, as I’ve noted in my research. Like many others, the egg supply chain needs to be reinvented to balance price, scale, resiliency and stability.

Supply chain issues

What is driving up the prices of eggs and other consumer goods is the concentration of producers. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed just how vulnerable prices and supply chains are.

Five years ago this month, when the pandemic started, many products became unavailable and more expensive.

In 2022, a major product recall of Similac led to a baby formula shortage in the U.S. The baby formula market is highly concentrated, with four companies responsible for approximately 90% of the domestic market. A large-scale facility that produced the baby formula was found to have unsanitary conditions and contaminated products. Pulling this one facility offline at the same time the nation was coping with pandemic-related supply chain issues led to the shortage.

Then at the beginning of 2024, supplies of insulin ran short due to production issues at Eli Lilly, one of the three companies responsible for over 90% of the U.S. insulin market.

And in the second half of 2024, hospitals couldn’t get enough IV fluid due to damage caused by Hurricane Helene to a Baxter factory in North Carolina that manufactures approximately 60% of IV fluids in the U.S. This factory had been relocated to North Carolina from Puerto Rico due to the supply impact from Hurricane Maria that damaged the island in 2017.

In all of these cases, the supply chain was easily interrupted due to a reliance on a few large producers. In 2025, bird flu and eggs are just another example of America’s “efficiently broken” supply chain.

Bird flu and cost of eggs

In the U.S., the top five egg producers are responsible for 40% of hens, with Mississippi-based Cal-Maine Foods alone responsible for 13% of total U.S. production.

An average-sized production facility in the U.S. can house 75,000 to 500,000 hens. Large facilities can house over 4 million. The mass production of eggs from these facilities means eggs are, in stable times, cost effective for the American consumer. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, eggs in the U.S. never surpassed $3 a dozen, and it was an affordable food solution compared with processed foods.

But this scale and efficiency comes at the price of resiliency during something like a bird flu outbreak. Larger farms create a higher risk of viral outbreak, which leads to the need for culling millions of birds and a heightened risk of viral replication and mutation.

The solution may increase prices

Policymakers want to reduce the spread of disease at American egg factories to mitigate the spread of bird flu. But these measures are expensive.

Factory farms increase the potential for viruses to spread rapidly and even mutate. Therefore, bird flu is a more serious precursor of supply chain disruption than a hurricane or product recall because it has the potential to create a public health crisis.

One solution to limit the spread of bird flu is to regulate the number of hens allowed in a single facility. This would lead to smaller and more farms across the U.S., but also higher consumer prices.

This solution would mirror other countries such as Canada, where the average facility size is much smaller than in the U.S. and eggs and poultry cost significantly more. That’s why – under the terms of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement – Canada has quota and tariff protection from American companies flooding its market with eggs and poultry that would cost consumers two to three times less.

Yet in March 2025, the price of eggs in Canada is 50% cheaper than eggs in the U.S. because the country has not suffered the same damages from bird flu.

Following Canada’s lead wouldn’t result in egg prices as low as giant factory farms, but it would protect American consumers from the periodic price shocks caused by disease or localized weather events that disrupt supplies.

Despite the threat of a public health crisis, American consumers don’t want to pay more for eggs – and their leaders have promised they won’t have to.

Zelensky has now accepted the partial ceasefire demanded by the US, paving the way for negotiations to reach a peace agreement with Russia.

Perhaps feeling vindicated by Trump’s rhetoric, and with the upper hand on the battlefield, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been reluctant to accept the US proposal for a full cessation of hostilities. So far, he has only agreed to halt attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.

Putin is most likely weighing up the possibility of an eventual collapse of the Ukrainian front. At the very least, he will be seeking to consolidate his advantage, and to negotiate from a position of strength that would allow him to impose conditions on peace negotiations. As a bare minimum, these conditions would include keeping occupied Ukrainian territory, keeping Ukraine out of Western institutions like the EU and Nato, and avoiding the deployment of Nato forces.

However, even if a negotiation were to give him all this, the underlying geopolitical issue that drove Putin to war would be far from resolved. Controlling Ukraine is a cornerstone of Russia’s territorial bulwark, which it considers essential for its security in the west.

However much it now appears the victor, Russia is far from having achieved the aims of its 2022 invasion. A peace that does not fully satisfy its security needs will, for Russia, be a bad peace, and will leave questions open. As a natural consequence, it is prudent to prepare in order to avoid, or confront, further conflict in the future.

Negotiating without Europe

With the exception of brief visits to the White House by a several of its leaders, Europe has been left out of negotiating efforts. It has been ignored on an issue that, if only for geographical reasons, concerns it directly. This disregard shows how little the continent matters to its North American partner, and forces European states to face existential questions.

In fairness, Russia harbours no imperialist intentions (though one can never truly know how it would act if it were to find a clear path to the Atlantic), but it does want to restore the security shield it lost at the end of the Cold War. We cannot rule out the possibility that, in the future, it might insist on this if the geostrategic conditions are right. This is a source of acute concern for policy-makers in Eastern European states, particularly those of the Baltic republics.

On its own, Europe cannot guarantee Ukraine the support it received from the West when the US was involved in the war effort. From a pragmatic point of view, it has little choice. It will probably accept the US effort to end the war, trying to make its voice heard in the process and, if Russia accepts it, go as far as deploying peacekeeping troops.

European strategic autonomy

In the meantime, the continent should not let up in the effort it has begun to strengthen its defence capabilities. It needs this not only as a deterrent, but also as the only way to maintain US interest in Nato, which remains vital to European security.

Assuming there is no going back on the project of political integration, Europe needs sufficient, credible military power (and power projection) if its voice is to be heard in an increasingly harsh international arena.

Read more: Europe's rearmament is moving fast – it must not overlook these three vital areas

Ongoing efforts to achieve real strategic autonomy must also cultivate and strengthen the transatlantic link. Neither the US nor Europe has an interest in damaging, let alone severing, their relations. If that were to happen, the US nuclear umbrella would disappear, opening the way for a future full of worrying unknowns in which European states might fragment, and seek solutions to their security problems alone.

This could, in turn, lead to all manner of unpredictable scenarios, including the end of the EU itself, nuclear proliferation on the continent, an adversarial relationship with the US.

Europe must prepare for a future in which it has to confront the Russian threat without the unconditional support it has hitherto received from the United States. This vital if it is to continue accepting the sacrosanct sovereignty of states, and their right to decide the path they want to follow without interference. This means that it cannot surrender to the idea that Russia has the right to a security sphere of its own.

It would, however, do well to maintain the shield it has deployed to the east since 2014, both for deterrence purposes and as a show of resolve and collective commitment to continental security.

Europe must rise to this historic moment and seize the opportunity to grow as a global actor. However, it has to navigate carefully between the icebergs of the European project’s deterioration and the United States’ alienation from the continent’s security. It must also contend with the possibility of a definitive break from Moscow, one that precludes the rebuilding of a framework of understanding between the two powers that, if not now, will be fundamental in the future.",theconversation

Like other recent general elections, both in Canada and around the world, this federal election campaign is sure to be characterized by polarized misinformation.

We all have someone in our families or social circles who has political opinions grounded in false or misleading information. Whether the source of that information is Russian bots on social media, high-profile podcasters or Fox News, it’s easy to dread election-time conversations as misinformation strains our most important relationships.

But perhaps we can approach these conversations as an opportunity to push back against growing polarization in our communities.

My research shows that polarization and misinformation often go hand in hand, and when they do, the information being spread is strongly resistant to being corrected by way of evidence.

But when we truly begin to listen to the people who believe misinformation, we can often help counter false claims. So in this upcoming election, how can we push back against election misinformation when we hear it? Let’s examine some strategies.

The role of anxiety

Most people think that others who believe misinformation will change their minds if provided with the right evidence, but that’s simply not true.

People have good reasons for not wanting to change their minds, even when confronted with contradictory facts. One of the key personality traits linked to the belief in misinformation turns out to be anxiety. This can manifest in ways that resist correction.

For example, most of us feel anxious when we have to hold two conflicting beliefs at the same time. So if we already believe misinformation and are confronted with evidence to the contrary, we may reject the evidence to avoid the dissonance of managing both beliefs.

Additionally, people might believe something because others in their social group believe it, meaning there is social anxiety associated with rejecting the group’s belief, even if it’s wrong.

Finally, anxiety about the future can drive people to accept misinformation that helps to relieve those fears.

Taken together, this means that correcting political misinformation, which involves all three of the above triggers — self, social and future anxiety — cannot be accomplished solely by providing evidence. We need to mitigate these anxieties while engaging in gentle correction since outright correcting can make the anxieties worse.

The ‘AIMS’ method

Motivational interviewing is a proven method of pushing back against another type of polarizing misinformation: health misinformation.

One particular approach to motivational interviewing, known as the AIMS method, has been successfully tested in Canada for countering vaccine misinformation.

AIMS stands for Announce, Inquire, Mirror and Secure. It provides a way to address misinformation while building the sort of connection and trust that people need to reduce the anxiety that is the trigger for believing misinformation in the first place.

The first step, Announce, is where the topic is approached. In the medical world, this usually occurs when a doctor announces that it’s time for a vaccine, but in the world of political misinformation, the announcement doesn’t have to come from a professional.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young

Instead, Announce can occur when the person you are talking to announces a piece of political misinformation, like the claim that the government is vaccinating people for the purposes of controlling the population. Announce is basically where the process of addressing misinformation begins.

Inquire is the step where motivational interviewing really begins to differ from a conventional approach of simply providing evidence to back up a false claim. In this second step, it’s important to ask questions, and approach the misinformation with a sense of curiosity.

Basically, as you probe more and more deeply, you’re trying to understand the anxieties that are driving the misinformation belief.

As you ask questions, you begin to also engage in the third step, Mirror. Mirroring means checking in, and repeating what you’re hearing so that the person you are talking to recognizes they’re being heard. At this stage, you can begin to introduce pieces of evidence that disprove the claims being made, but only after you truly understand the person’s concerns and can reflect them back.

It’s also important to manage how you introduce contradictory evidence. It must be done with compassion and a gentle but reassuring manner.

Finally, when all the concerns have been addressed, you can begin the final step, which is to Secure trust. Here you can follow up on the announcement that sparked the discussion — the original piece of misinformation — and see if the person you’re talking to now feels differently than they did before.

Importantly, you may not be successful at securing this step in just one conversation, but if you have conducted the other steps properly, you will have built important trust that, over time, is more likely to help you counter future misinformation with the person you’re talking to.

Preserving relationships

Combating any misinformation, and especially political misinformation, is not a quick or easy process. It may have to take place in repeated discussions over a long period of time.

Political misinformation is particularly difficult to counter because political views are often tied deeply to people’s self-identity, and also because political misinformation is often shared within social groups.

But if you engage in motivated interviewing this election season, you may make a small difference. At the very least, you will help to preserve relationships with friends and loved ones that are often frayed when political misinformation enters the picture.",theconversation

They might want to figure out where to build a major airline hub. Or to determine how to maximize return while minimizing risk in an investment portfolio. Or to develop self-driving cars that can distinguish between traffic lights and stop signs.

Mathematically, these problems get translated into a search for the minimum values of functions. But in all these scenarios, the functions are too complicated to assess directly. Researchers have to approximate the minimal values instead.

It turns out that one of the best ways to do this is by using an algorithm that Isaac Newton developed over 300 years ago. This algorithm is fairly simple. It’s a little like searching, blindfolded, for the lowest point in an unfamiliar landscape. As you put one foot in front of the other, the only information you need is whether you’re going uphill or downhill, and whether the grade is increasing or decreasing. Using that information, you can get a good approximation of the minimum relatively quickly.

Although enormously powerful — centuries later, Newton’s method is still crucial for solving present-day problems in logistics, finance, computer vision and even pure math — it also has a significant shortcoming. It doesn’t work well on all functions. So mathematicians have continued to study the technique, figuring out different ways to broaden its scope without sacrificing efficiency.

Last summer, three researchers announced the latest improvement to Newton’s method. Amir Ali Ahmadi of Princeton University, along with his former students Abraar Chaudhry (now at the Georgia Institute of Technology) and Jeffrey Zhang (now at Yale University), extended Newton’s method to work efficiently on the broadest class of functions yet.

“Newton’s method has 1,000 different applications in optimization,” Ahmadi said. “Potentially our algorithm can replace it.”

In the 1680s, Isaac Newton developed an algorithm for finding optimal solutions. Three centuries later, mathematicians are still using and honing his method. Godfrey Kneller/Public Domain

A Centuries-Old Technique

Mathematical functions transform inputs into outputs. Often, the most important feature of a function is its minimum value — the combination of inputs that produces the smallest possible output.

But finding the minimum is hard. Functions can have dozens of variables raised to high powers, defying formulaic analysis; graphs of their solutions form high-dimensional landscapes that are impossible to explore from a bird’s-eye view. In those higher-dimensional landscapes, said Coralia Cartis of the University of Oxford, “We want to find a valley. Some are local valleys; others are the lowest point. You’re trying to find these things, and the question is: What info do you have to guide you to that?”

In the 1680s, Newton recognized that even when you’re dealing with a very complicated function, you’ll still always have access to at least two pieces of information to help you find its deepest valley. First, you can calculate the function’s so-called first derivative, or slope: the steepness of the function at a given point. Second, you can compute the rate at which the slope itself is changing (the function’s second derivative).

Amir Ali Ahmadi sees optimization problems everywhere he looks. Archives of the Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach

Say you’re trying to find the minimum of some complicated function. First, choose a point on the function that you think might be close to the true minimum. Compute the function’s first and second derivatives at that point. These derivatives can be used to construct a special quadratic equation — a parabola if your function lives in a 2D plane, and a cuplike shape called a paraboloid if your function is higher dimensional. This quadratic equation, which is called a Taylor approximation, roughly resembles your function at the point you chose.

Now calculate the minimum of the quadratic equation instead of the original — something you can do easily, using a well-known formula. (That’s because quadratic equations are simple; it’s when equations get more complicated that calculating the minimum becomes prohibitive.) You’ll get a point. Then plug the coordinates of that point back into your original function, and you’ll get a new point on the function that is, hopefully, closer to its true minimum. Start the entire process again.

Newton proved that if you keep on repeating this process, you’ll eventually home in on the minimum value of the original, more complicated function. The method doesn’t always work, especially if you start at a point that’s too far away from the true minimum. But for the most part, it does. And it has some desirable attributes.

Mark Belan/Quanta Magazine; Source: arxiv:2305.07512

Other iterative methods, like gradient descent — the algorithm used in today’s machine learning models — converge toward the true minimum at a linear rate. Newton’s method converges toward it much faster: at a “quadratic” rate. In other words, it can identify the minimum value in fewer iterations than gradient descent. (Each iteration of Newton’s method is more computationally expensive than an iteration of gradient descent, which is why researchers prefer gradient descent for certain applications, like training neural networks. But Newton’s method is still enormously efficient, making it useful in all sorts of contexts.)

Newton could have written his method to converge toward the true minimum value even faster if, instead of taking just the first and second derivatives at each point, he had also taken, say, the third and fourth derivatives. That would have given him more complicated Taylor approximations, with exponents greater than 2. But the whole crux of his strategy was to transform a complicated function into a simpler one. These more complicated Taylor equations were more than Newton could handle mathematically.

“Newton did it for degree 2. He did that because nobody knew how to minimize higher-order polynomials,” Ahmadi said.

In the centuries since, mathematicians have worked to extend his method, to probe how much information they can squeeze out of more complicated Taylor approximations of their functions.

In the 19th century, for instance, the Russian mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev proposed a version of Newton’s method that approximated functions with cubic equations (which have an exponent of 3). But his algorithm didn’t work when the original function involved multiple variables. Much more recently, in 2021, Yurii Nesterov (now at Corvinus University of Budapest) demonstrated how to approximate functions of any number of variables efficiently with cubic equations. But his method couldn’t be extended to approximate functions using quartic equations, quintics and so on without losing its efficiency. Nevertheless, the proof was a major breakthrough in the field.

Now Ahmadi, Chaudhry and Zhang have taken Nesterov’s result another step further. Their algorithm works for any number of variables and arbitrarily many derivatives. Moreover, it remains efficient for all these cases — something that until now wasn’t possible.

But first, they had to find a way to make a hard math problem a lot easier.

Finding Wiggle Room

There is no fast, general purpose method for finding the minima of functions raised to high exponents. That’s always been the main limitation of Newton’s method. But there are certain types of functions that have characteristics that make them easy to minimize. In the new work, Ahmadi, Chaudhry and Zhang prove that it’s always possible to find approximating equations that have these characteristics. They then show how to adapt these equations to run Newton’s method efficiently.

What properties make an equation easy to minimize? Two things: The first is that the equation should be bowl-shaped, or “convex.” Rather than having many valleys, it has just one — meaning that when you try to minimize it, you don’t have to worry about mistaking an arbitrary valley for the lowest one.

Abraar Chaudhry and two colleagues recently found a way to improve a centuries-old method for finding the minima of functions. Camille Carpenter Henriquez

The second property is that the equation can be written as a sum of squares. For example, 5x2 + 16x + 13 can be written as the sum (x + 2)2 + (2x + 3)2. In recent years, mathematicians have developed techniques for minimizing equations with arbitrarily large exponents so long as they are both convex and a sum of squares. However, those techniques were of little help when it came to Newton’s method. Most of the time, the Taylor approximation you use won’t have these nice properties.

But Ahmadi, Chaudhry and Zhang figured out how to use a technique called semidefinite programming to wiggle the Taylor approximation just enough to make it both a sum of squares and convex, though not so much that it became unmoored from the original function it was supposed to resemble.

They essentially added a fudge factor to the Taylor expansion, turning it into an equation that had the two desired properties. “We can change the Taylor expansion a bit to make it simpler to minimize. Think of the Taylor expansion, but modified a little bit,” Ahmadi said. He and his colleagues then showed that, using this modified version of the Taylor expansion — which involved arbitrarily many derivatives — their algorithm would still converge on the true minimum of the original function. Moreover, the rate of convergence would scale with the number of derivatives used: Just as using two derivatives allowed Newton to approach the true minimum at a quadratic rate, using three derivatives enabled the researchers to approach it at a cubic rate, and so on.

Ahmadi, Chaudhry and Zhang had created a more powerful version of Newton’s method that could reach the true minimum value of a function in fewer iterations than previous techniques.

Like the original version of Newton’s method, each iteration of this new algorithm is still computationally more expensive than methods such as gradient descent. As a result, for the moment, the new work won’t change the way self-driving cars, machine learning algorithms or air traffic control systems work. The best bet in these cases is still gradient descent.

“Many ideas in optimization take years before they are made fully practical,” said Jason Altschuler of the University of Pennsylvania. “But this seems like a fresh perspective.”

If, over time, the underlying computational technology needed to run Newton’s method becomes more efficient — making each iteration less computationally expensive — then the algorithm developed by Ahmadi, Chaudhry and Zhang could eventually surpass gradient descent for all sorts of applications, including machine learning.

“Our algorithm right now is provably faster, in theory,” Ahmadi said. He’s hopeful, he added, that in 10 to 20 years, it will also be so in practice.",quantamagazine
https://undark.org,Lawsuits Against Diversity Initiatives in Science Multiply,https://undark.org/2025/03/24/lawsuits-diversity-initiatives-science/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","On March 5, Do No Harm, an organization that advocates against diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in medicine, among other issues, sued the American Chemical Society for its Scholars Program, which provides financial support to chemistry students from underrepresented backgrounds. The complaint argues the program is illegal because it is not open to White and Asian students. Around two weeks later, Do No Harm also sued the University of Pennsylvania for its partnership with a database called the Black Doctors Directory, which allows patients to find Black physicians.

The lawsuits join a recent uptick in legal action against universities, departments, and professional societies that host programs intended to increase diversity across academia, including in the sciences. In May 2024, for example, White students at the University of Oklahoma sued their school, alleging the university discriminated against them by factoring in race when determining financial aid. In August, a conservative activist group sued the Department of Education over the Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program, which provides mentoring and research support to underrepresented students pursuing doctoral degrees. Those cases followed the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision against factoring in race when considering college admissions, effectively striking down affirmative action.

“What’s happened here is the organizations bringing these lawsuits, they’re capitalizing on the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down race-conscious admissions,” said Vinay Harpalani, a professor at the University of New Mexico School of Law and an expert on affirmative action policies.

Now with President Donald Trump’s administration in the White House and a conservative Supreme Court, more organizations may feel inclined to bring these types of lawsuits, he said. “They’re really trying to expand this doctrine, the scope of this idea the Supreme Court has that we shouldn’t use individual race at all in making any of these types of decisions.” (Do No Harm did not reply to a list of questions or repeated requests for an interview.)

Many legal scholars and scientists say that such cases will hurt the scientific community. “I just think that we’re going backwards,” said Daniel Mindiola, a chemistry researcher at the University of Pennsylvania who is an alumnus of the ACS program. “I feel like we’re revisiting history again, and we’re reliving or dissolving what so far has been accomplished with diversity.”

Do No Harm brought the lawsuit against ACS on behalf of a student who, they say, met all the qualifications for the program except the racial requirement. The unnamed student, a high school senior with a 4.35 GPA who plans to major in chemistry, wanted to apply for one of the scholarships of up to $5,000 per year. But the student, whom the complaint describes as half-White and half-South Asian, was ineligible. Do No Harm’s lawsuit states that was because the Scholars program is only open to applicants who are Black or of African descent, Hispanic or Latino, or Indigenous.

On its website, the ACS frames the program as an important way to help increase diversity in the sciences, noting that people from underrepresented groups make up one-third of college-aged U.S. citizens, but earn about 18 percent of chemical science bachelor’s degrees and little more than 10 percent of chemistry doctorates. More than 450 of the program’s alumni have earned a doctorate.

Do No Harm describes the program in different language. “The American Chemical Society is blatantly discriminating against aspiring chemists simply based on their skin color,” Do No Harm wrote on its website. In doing so, the organization alleges, ACS violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs that receive federal financial assistance, and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which says that all individuals have equal rights to make and enforce contracts.

“You can’t decide who to contract with and not and who not to contract with based on race,” said Dan Morenoff, an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think-tank, and the executive director at the American Civil Rights Project.

Do No Harm’s press release also says that the ACS is in violation of a recent executive order on DEI initiatives in the federal government. In its complaint, the organization states the ACS constitutes as a federal program because of the assistance it receives in the form of tax deductions for charitable contributions.

Do No Harm was launched in 2022 with the goal of “protecting patients and physicians from woke healthcare.” Its founder, Stanley Goldfarb, is the former associate dean at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. Goldfarb has a long history of opposing what he considers discriminatory racial diversity programs, as well as gender affirming care for children. According to tax filings, the Do No Harm initiative was jumpstarted by a $1 million donation from the family foundation of Joseph Edelman, a hedge fund manager.

“What’s happened here is the organizations bringing these lawsuits, they’re capitalizing on the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down race-conscious admissions.”

Since 2022, the organization has used litigation as a way to target diversity programs, including initiatives at Pfizer, the University of Colorado, the University of Washington School of Medicine, and the American Association of University Women. They have also sought to influence legislation against pediatric gender-affirming care.

Most recently, they sued the University of Pennsylvania and others for a directory that allows patients to look for Black doctors, saying that the directory is illegal under Title VI of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964.

The lawsuit against Pfizer seems to have achieved Do No Harm’s goal. In 2023, the company opened a diversity fellowship to applicants of all races.

The loss of scholarships like the ACS Scholars Program would harm the scientific community, and in particular people who historically have lacked access and resources to pursue careers in the sciences, said Mindiola. He’s experienced this firsthand: The scholarship allowed Mindiola, who is originally from Venezuela, to focus on his lab research without having to take an outside job to sustain himself. “It just helped me move forward,” he said. These programs, he added, are not discriminating. “They’re trying to give those races that have a historically low rate of participation a chance.”

The Scholars Program has provided funding for around 3,500 students to support their studies in scientific fields. With these lawsuits, “there are students who are currently enrolled, students who will be enrolled, who see themselves being attacked,” said Matt Hartings, an associate professor of chemistry at American University.

The potential loss of these programs, Harpalani added, could have a detrimental effect on scientific research: If underrepresented scientists no longer have the resources to continue in their careers, the field might lose important role models and new ways of thinking. Mindiola shared a similar sentiment. “I think what makes science move forward is to have a different perspective, because you come from a different background,” he said.

“I would bet pretty strongly that if this gets fought out, Do No Harm is going to win.”

Harpalani also pointed out that physicians of color are more likely to provide medical service in underserved areas. And some recent research has suggested that racial concordance, in which a patient and a physician are the same race and the driving force behind the Black Doctors Directory, helps patients get better care and have more trust in the health care system. Other research has found that the evidence for this is more mixed, however, and the lawsuit that Do No Harm filed against University of Pennsylvania describes the notion of racial concordance as “thoroughly debunked.”

The American Chemical Society, meanwhile, is already changing language related to diversity, editing a headline on its website from “Advancing ACS’ Core Value of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Respect” to “Advancing ACS’ Core Value of Inclusion and Belonging.” The recent round of applications for the Scholars Program just closed on March 1, though it remains unclear whether the program will continue. Mindiola said he normally gets asked to be on the selection committee for high school and college applicants, but did not receive an inquiry this year. The ACS did not respond to a request for comment because they do “not comment on active litigation.”

Morenoff, at the Manhattan Institute, thinks Do No Harm’s lawsuit has a good shot at success: “I would bet pretty strongly that if this gets fought out, Do No Harm is going to win.”

But Hartings suggested that even short of a court victory, the mere threat of lawsuits is likely to push many organizations to cancel or scale back their diversity programming, “Even that’s a win for them,” he said.",undark
