Sherene Schlegel, RN, COO and CNO, virtual care and digital health, at Providence

The Providence health system has an internal service available to its 51 hospitals and other rural and community hospitals in its eight-state service area, bringing specialists and other high-demand providers virtually to the hospital bedside.

This acute care telemedicine service – built by and for Providence – seamlessly integrates with clinical workflows and processes to provide quality care to any hospitalized patient in the Providence hospital ecosystem.

THE CHALLENGE

Anyone caring for critically ill patients knows that access to specialists and high-demand providers within hospitals is essential to achieving good outcomes and supporting patients and caregivers. Scheduled and on-demand access to neurologists, infectious disease specialists, hospitalists, intensivists and psychiatrists is proven to address these goals. However, the workforce crisis is making the job of staffing to need a tough battle.

The problem is three pronged – revolving around provider supply, demand and distribution of clinical expertise, said Sherene Schlegel, RN, COO and CNO, virtual care and digital health, at Providence.

"First, on the supply side, we have significant shortfalls in the number of physicians who can treat specific conditions due to a broad set of factors – but the aging population of our current physicians and burnout are playing a significant role," she explained.

"Nationally, 41% of ICU physicians have reported a high level of burnout, 55% of physicians will be age 75 or older by 2036, and more than half of infectious disease residency training programs go unfilled," she continued. 

"So, this problem is real. On the demand side, aging patient populations and new treatment options are increasing the demand for specialists. In fact, most hospital stays require at least one specialty consultation."

In such a supply-and-demand constrained environment, the distribution of physicians – where they are geographically in the world – starts to make a tremendous difference. In the acute care environment, a strong telemedicine program can get excellent specialists and high-demand providers to the bedside of any hospitalized patient in a service area, she added.

That's why the health system has been developing the Providence Virtual Acute Care program over the last 10 or so years.

PROPOSAL

"Here at Providence, we have been at the forefront of delivering virtual acute care services since the beginning – so we've been developing and learning what makes an effective program," Schlegel said.

"For us, our high-quality, mission-based care is non-negotiable – so we wanted to develop a program that focused on enabling our own Providence providers to be available at the patient's bedside within the hospital," she continued. "Having our virtual team be Providence providers – who meet the high quality, credentialing and governance requirements used across our system and who know our internal systems, protocols and workflows – was essential."

The virtual providers are colleagues of those at the hospital site, and staff believe that makes a tremendous difference.

"Over the years, we've also learned a lot about the delicate balance that exists between operational scalability and hospital-specific requirements," Schlegel noted. "To make the program operationally feasible, we needed to take advantage of the economies of scale that a health system like Providence has.

"With 51 hospitals and hundreds of referral hospitals within our service area, program scalability is both possible and essential," she continued. "But we also are keenly aware each hospital brings its own unique challenges that must be embraced through the program."

Utilization, staffing and recruiting preferences and constraints, the nuances of the community served, and the services available to care for them – all have an impact on how care decisions are made. Providence needed to assure it was able to consider the hospital-specific requirements as well.

"For these reasons, national telemedicine services really fall short – so for us, developing a Providence-specific virtual acute telemedicine program was essential," Schlegel stated.

MEETING THE CHALLENGE

Over the years, the Providence Virtual Acute Care service has evolved into a highly valuable, comprehensive and scalable program that is meeting the needs of the health system's hospitals and other hospitals in the referral networks.

There are six core components to the program.

First, Providence providers. The service starts with providers.

"We don't just integrate with Providence, we are Providence," Schlegel explained. "Our service was built by and for our hospitals and referral hospitals, and our providers are Providence employees who meet or exceed our standards for employment and service levels. 

"We are full-service teams focused on delivering mission-based care and helping our colleagues deliver on their patient care goals," she added. " We use the same systems they use and are focused on providing our unique Providence brand of mission-based care."

Next, clinical quality programs and analytics. Staff layer on top of all of this a standards-based quality program that incorporates ongoing monitoring for adherence and reporting against established KPIs – including quality of patient care, programs and physicians.

Then, customized clinical design. The hospital-specific clinical design process recognizes the unique service availability, referral preferences and operational norms of a hospital and optimizes workflows accordingly. The system is deeply integrated into existing workflow, processes and operations, while adhering to and supporting Providence standards of care, governance models and mission.

Next, one-call-for-all service. "Our unprecedented 'one-call-for-all,' real-time patient support manages immediate action for any hospital requirement or issue," Schlegel explained. "Our Digital Access Center ensures clinicians and stakeholders get the crucial assistance they need to perform at their best. This includes a 24/7 virtual response team, stakeholder support and service levels."

Further, cross-Providence exam technology.

"We are equipped with high-definition cameras and integrated peripheral devices that allow the facilitation of comprehensive, remote examinations," Schlegel noted. "Our exam hardware and software are standardized across Providence to deliver a price, support and experience advantage.

"We use highly reliable bidirectional audio/video technology, including carts, wall-mounted units and tablets, as well as examination tools such as Bluetooth-enabled stethoscopes and peripheral devices – delivered at a price advantage through cross-Providence, volume-based contracts," she continued. 

"Our clinician portal supports request triage and case assignment, provides safety and quality controls to ensure appropriate licensing and credentialing, as well as manages scheduling using Providence Epic instances and service-line standards."

And finally, the Telemedicine Resource Center. "Last, we provide shared services that support our hospitals as they transition toward a virtual care augmented hospital," she said. "We provide learning and education opportunities for every level and function, helping the organizations we serve to manage the differences and complexities of telehealth operations."

RESULTS

Virtual care at Providence is proving to be an important component of the health system's care delivery. Today, the health system has more than 250 virtually enabled acute care clinicians delivering service in more than 100 sites in eight states, and delivers more than a million patient encounters every year.

The Providence Virtual Acute Care services has evolved from tele-stroke alone to eight offerings including:

The tele-stroke service line, live in more than 80 sites, serving more than 16,000 patients every year with an average response time of 2.4 minutes.

The emergent tele-neurology offering, serving more than 1,000 patients every year at 28 sites, providing 24/7 neurology coverage to hard-to-recruit service areas.

The tele-neurohospitalist service line, offering 24/7 access to board-certified neurologists at eight sites, reducing transfers and improving patient outcomes.

The tele-EEG service line, live at 12 sites, enabling EEGs at sites without machines to be conducted and reach within 24 hours and stat requests to be read within two hours.

The telepsychiatry service line, live at more than 40 sites, with an average response time of less than seven minutes. One in three patients are rapidly triaged and sent to lower acuity care.

The tele-critical-care service line, which has decreased risk-adjusted mortality, decreased length of stay and reduced transfer rates.

The tele-hospitalist service line, which has demonstrated reduced ED wait times of more than 6-times at partner hospitals, contributed to decreased length of stay, and offers cross-cover resolution times of less than 10 minutes.

The recently launched tele-infectious-disease service line, offering same-day consults 365 days per year; early infectious disease consultation can reduce length of stay by up to 29% and reduce 30-day readmissions by 8%.

ADVICE FOR OTHERS

"I would emphasize the critical role virtual care plays in mitigating clinician shortages and allowing patients to have access to care regardless of their geographic location," Schlegel said. "Virtual care not only alleviates staffing constraints but also enhances patient outcomes by providing timely access to expert care – and is incredibly meaningful to families who are able to keep their loved ones close to home.

"I don't believe flexibility is a trend – I think it's the new currency of hospital employment," she continued. "When done right it's good for patients, good for hospitals, good for administrators and good for our clinicians. That said, embracing flexibility should not mean a compromise to care quality. It's important to figure out a way to both have scalability and deliver quality care. Through many years of learning, we've figured out a model to do both."

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel joins 'America Reports' to discuss the Department of Government Efficiency's audit of Medicare and studies suggesting some Americans could get healthier by rejoining the work force.

EXCLUSIVE: A Medicaid and Medicare fraud crackdown is anticipated with a bipartisan congressional proposal to check Social Security Administration death records.

The legislation, dubbed the Medicare and Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act, would mandate state governments to see if the Social Security Death Master Files show physicians who are still considered part of the government programs meant for seniors and low-income Americans. The check is meant to ensure that the doctor's National Provider Identifier will not be used by bad actors to commit fraud.  

"We must eliminate and be proactive against fraud within Medicaid and Medicare to protect the programs for those who truly need it. I'm proud to co-lead the bipartisan Medicare and Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act to advocate for access to quality health care for Americans who rely on these programs." Rep. Gabe Evans, R-Colo., who is running the bill with Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

Legislation under the same name was introduced by former Rep. Mike Garcia, R-Calif., and Peters last year. The bill passed the House and was referred to the Senate Finance Committee, but no further action was taken after that point.  

"Fraud in Medicare and Medicaid hurts the rightful beneficiaries of those programs and all taxpayers," Peters said in a statement at the time. 

"Our bipartisan bill will prevent one of the most egregious forms of fraud in our healthcare system. As we work to put our country on a better fiscal path and tackle our enormous debt, we must do everything we can to stop taxpayer dollars from being misspent," the congressman added.

The legislation's introduction comes as there is heightened scrutiny on the program at both the state and federal levels. In Evans' home state of Colorado, $7.3 million was given to insurance companies to care for deceased Medicaid recipients, The Denver Post reported.

Meanwhile, California is facing scrutiny for a $9.5 billion price tag for its Medicaid affiliate, Medi-Cal, despite originally only expecting it to cost $6 billion.

While California Gov. Gavin Newsom did say that illegal immigrants now being able to enroll in the program is part of the issue, he argued that the Golden State is like Colorado, Pennsylvania and Indiana when it comes to higher costs for operating the program across the board.

In fiscal year 2024, there were $54.3 billion in "improper payments" for Medicare and $31.1 billion for Medicaid, according to the Government Accountability Office. Meanwhile, the Department of Government Efficiency has reportedly looked into government healthcare program spending.

For Christian Rich (MS '24, BIO), the path to building a clinic in Kenya began with a game of basketball.

During high school Rich had the opportunity to play for the Mountain Stars Basketball Club, a non-profit organization that brings American and African basketball players together for games and service-oriented aid missions. Although Rich no longer plays for Mountain Stars, the love of service he developed during his trips to Africa inspired him to continue building on the connection he shares with the people of Kenya.

“Every trip the Mountain Stars team participated in included donating healthcare supplies,” Rich shares. “It became clear to me that this is one of the biggest unfulfilled needs faced by the African people. From there, I saw such a natural bridge between my love for Africa and my love for medicine.”

Building on that bridge, Rich is now working closely with Avery Zentner, a pre-health student at Utah Tech University, to spearhead a transformative healthcare initiative in Kenya. Collaborating with the Kilifi County Government and Koins for Kenya, Rich and Zentner aim to build a much-needed medical clinic in the village of Shaka. The clinic will address the urgent healthcare gaps in the area, where residents currently walk up to nine miles to access basic medical care.

Once a thriving center of commerce, particularly in salt, the village now stands as a shadow of its former self. After heavy rains swept the salt away, the disaster became part of the village's identity and it was renamed Shaka, symbolizing unexpected challenges. As a village still on the mend, Shaka residents face constant challenges. They have no immediate access to medical care, having to walk 3 hours to the nearest clinic. For many, the trek for medical assistance becomes a perilous gamble, with lives lost on the way due to the time-sensitive nature of their ailments.

Understanding Shaka's unique challenges allowed Rich and Zentner to plan accordingly. “We want to create an outpatient clinic,” Rich explains. “We will help construct the facility, supply it with equipment and an initial stock of supplies—such as bandages and medication—and then we'll step back and the county government will take on the responsibility of employing personnel and running the clinic.”

Rich and Zentner credit Koins for Kenya as one of the essential driving forces behind their project's success. Originally connecting with the organization through the Mountain Stars Basketball team, Koins for Kenya responded enthusiastically when Rich and Zentner proposed their plan to build a clinic. “Koins for Kenya is the reason that this is all possible,” Zentner explains. “Leah, our liaison, is able to communicate with the African government, which in turn supports us with the electricity and employees we need. She was the one who traveled to the different villages to see which one could benefit the most from the creation of a clinic, and ultimately, she decided to go with a village called Shaka.”

Construction began in February of 2025, and Rich and Zentner are optimistic that this clinic will serve as a cornerstone for a region on the path to recovery. They plan to arrive in Kenya in May to assist with the completion of the clinic's construction. However, their vision does not stop there. The clinic will have the necessary infrastructure to grow into a full maternity wing or birthing unit in the future. In other parts of Africa, even small interventions—like providing prenatal vitamins to expectant mothers—have led to significant improvements. Rich and Zentner are hopeful that this clinic will create lasting positive change in Shaka.

As Rich and Zentner reflect on their experiences, both students express a deep sense of gratitude. Zentner recalls the uncertainty the group faced as they worked toward their ambitious fundraising goals, followed by the joy they felt when they achieved them this past December.

“There's no way we could've done that on our own,” Zentner says. “Through God it is possible to do these hard things in college. It's possible to raise money for people who are in need.”

Reflecting on the way the project has strengthened his love for service, Rich adds, “This experience touches you in a way that's hard to put into words.” Though Shaka's road to recovery will be long and arduous, it is thanks to students like Rich and Zentner that hope is being reintroduced into this resilient community. Rich is a great example of a student embracing BYU's motto of “go forth to serve.”

Hospitals across the U.S. are seeing steady financial performance, driven by increased patient volumes, even as high expenses remain a persistent challenge, according to Kaufman Hall's January 2025 National Hospital Flash Report.

The report, based on data from more than 1,300 hospitals, provides a snapshot of hospital revenue, expenses and margins at the start of the year.

Despite a continued rise in drug and supply costs, inpatient revenue grew at a faster rate than outpatient revenue, signaling a shift in hospital utilization patterns.

"The growth in volumes and inpatient revenue in January may be related in part to seasonal factors from the flu and other respiratory illnesses," Erik Swanson, managing director and group leader of data and analytics at Kaufman Hall, told HealthcareFinanceNews.

Cost growth slows, expenses remain high

One of the key findings of the report is that cost growth has slowed compared to previous years, offering some financial relief to hospitals. However, expenses, particularly in labor and pharmaceuticals, remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels.

"Hospitals are seeing some relief from extreme cost spikes, but drug and supply chain expenses continue to be a major concern," Swanson said. "Many organizations are joining group purchasing organizations, seeking generic substitutions, or exploring biosimilar drugs to control spending."

Hospitals are also optimizing their workforce to reduce costs while maintaining quality care.

"Some health systems have developed in-house staffing agencies to meet changes in patient demand without relying on third-party agencies," Swanson said.

He added other organizations are focusing on workforce optimization techniques to better align staffing levels with patient demand.

Uncompensated care rises amid Medicaid disenrollments

A growing concern for hospitals is the increase in uncompensated care, which includes bad debt and charity care. The report noted the recent uptick may be linked to Medicaid disenrollments in 2023 and 2024.
 
"Recent increases in bad debt and charity care may be related in part to Medicaid disenrollments," Swanson said. "Hospitals need to prepare for potential further increases depending on changes in Medicaid policy."

Hospitals that manage all their departments close to financial performance benchmarks tend to fare better.

"High-performing hospitals tend to manage their departments efficiently, suggesting that focusing on departmental performance and simplifying administrative processes can help mitigate financial risks," Swanson explained.

Strategies to improve hospital margins

With hospitals still facing tight margins, shared services allocations are becoming an area of focus.

Managing these costs is challenging for hospitals of all sizes, with wide variations in how systems allocate expenses.

"The total spend for shared services functions is substantial and growing, and hospitals must take a proactive approach to cost control," Swanson said.

Hospitals are also working on improving clinical documentation to ensure accurate coding and reimbursement.

"Organizations are investing in clinical documentation improvement programs to make sure they are coding patients appropriately and getting reimbursed correctly," Swanson said.

As hospitals move forward, balancing cost containment with the need to expand services will be critical.

While inpatient revenue growth is encouraging, high labor costs, supply expenses, and rising uncompensated care remain key challenges.

"Hospitals must continue to refine their financial strategies," Swanson said. "Managing labor efficiently, leveraging group purchasing, and optimizing shared services will be crucial in maintaining financial stability."

Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of 13 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against other best healthcare dividend stocks to invest in.

The US healthcare sector has been at the forefront since the emergence of COVID-19 in 2020, leading to a significant transformation in the industry. The rise of telehealth, virtual consultations, and technological advancements has reshaped the way healthcare services are delivered.

Over the past two decades, the healthcare sector has expanded considerably in relation to the broader economy, as reflected in its growing share of gross domestic product (GDP). According to a report by CNBC, in 2003, healthcare spending made up 15.7% of US GDP, increasing by approximately 1.7 percentage points over the next decade to reach 17.4% in 2013. Today, it is estimated at around 18.4% of GDP, and projections from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services suggest it could rise to 20% by 2030. This steady increase is driven by several factors, including rising demand for healthcare services, advancements in medical technology, and escalating costs. The aging population, particularly as baby boomers retire, has significantly increased the need for medical care, while longer life expectancies have resulted in prolonged healthcare utilization. In addition, the prevalence of chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity has contributed to rising costs. The latest breakthroughs in diagnostics, treatments, and pharmaceuticals—though beneficial—often come with higher expenses, further fueling the sector's expansion.

The healthcare industry's share of the overall economy has expanded, with healthcare companies experiencing faster revenue growth than the broader market in the past five years. During this period, healthcare sector revenues have increased by nearly 61%, compared to just over 38% growth for the broader market as a whole, as reported by CNBC. However, despite this strong revenue performance, the healthcare sector has lagged behind the broader market index, which has been driven by the rapid expansion of the technology sector.

The healthcare sector faced a turbulent year in 2024. During the first half, investors gravitated toward industries such as technology and communication services, particularly those linked to the growing influence of AI, leaving healthcare stocks trailing behind. However, as the market rally broadened in the second half of the year, healthcare stocks saw some recovery, though certain segments continued to struggle with lingering supply-and-demand imbalances from the pandemic. Beyond these challenges, fundamental issues and policy uncertainties created additional obstacles for parts of the sector. While some regulatory pressures may ease with the incoming administration, others—such as drug pricing concerns—are expected to remain a persistent issue.

On a positive note, innovation remained robust throughout the year. Biotech companies delivered a series of encouraging clinical updates while growing enthusiasm for new treatments targeting obesity and diabetes contributed to an increase in pharmaceutical firms' market valuations. A Fidelity report suggested that the healthcare sector is well-positioned for growth in 2025. The industry benefits from strengthening business fundamentals, such as rising cash flows, and encompasses a diverse range of segments that offer a blend of defensive stability and growth potential, making it appealing across different market conditions.

The healthcare sector is also attracting attention due to its rising dividend payouts. In the third quarter of 2024, total dividends distributed by the global healthcare industry reached $25.7 billion, up from $18.7 billion in Q3 2018, reflecting steady growth in shareholder returns, according to a report by Janus Henderson.

For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of Q4 2024 and picked healthcare dividend companies. From that list, we chose healthcare stocks with a strong track record of paying dividends to shareholders, which makes them resilient in the current environment. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the hedge fund investors owning stakes in them, according to Insider Monkey's database of Q4 2024.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is an American multinational pharmaceutical company, headquartered in New Jersey. The company's substantial investment in research and development, along with its strategic emphasis on cardiovascular and rare diseases, reinforces confidence in its long-term revenue growth. In addition, the healthcare sector's resilience during economic downturns enhances Merck's attractiveness as an investment, as the demand for essential medications remains stable regardless of market conditions.

Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) reported strong financial performance, with revenue increasing 7% year-over-year to $15.6 billion. The company has strengthened its presence in specialty pharmaceuticals and oncology, with Keytruda remaining a cornerstone of its cancer treatment portfolio and a key contributor to revenue growth. Merck's solid market position has enabled it to maintain consistent cash flow, supporting its commitment to shareholder returns.

For the full year, Keytruda sales jumped 18% from the previous year, reaching $29.5 billion. The drug is expected to generate more than $35 billion in revenue by 2028 before its patent expires, further cementing Merck's leadership in the immunotherapy market.

Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)'s quarterly dividend comes in at $0.81 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.44%. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list with 14 consecutive years of dividend growth under its belt.

Overall, MRK ranks 6th on our list of best healthcare dividend stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.

A new rule proposed by the Trump administration could cancel health insurance access for people DACA recipients. 

If change were to take effect, it would undo a rule set by the Biden Administration last November to provide marketplace health care to people who qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Requirements for DACA include: a person must have arrived to the U.S. before they turned 16, have resided here continuously since and have been under 31 in 2012, when the program took effect, among others. 

24/7 San Diego news stream: Watch NBC 7 free wherever you are

The proposed change to Biden's rule argues that DACA recipients do not meet the “lawfully present” standard set by Congress to be eligible for the Affordable Care Act.

“Having health coverage taken away means that there are limitations to how I can live and how I should live,” DACA recipient, Javier Diego Jacinto said.

Jacinto arrived in the U.S. at age 6. As a child, he was covered under Medi-Cal, but once he turned 18 years old, his health coverage was in limbo due to his DACA status.

It's a struggle that other DACA recipients like, Elizabeth Naputi, understand all too well.

Three years ago, she had a medical emergency, but because she was uninsured, she was forced to take out a loan to cover the expenses.



“Something that would just help us pay for everything because just healthcare, in general, is super expensive,” Naputi said.

Last November, the Biden administration allowed DACA recipients to buy health coverage through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, but President Trump's administration is now considering reversing the rule, which would make DACA recipients ineligible for health coverage like Covered California.

“Canceling it is going to have a severely negative impact on people who essentially came as children, right? They didn't have a say in coming to the United States. And so, by canceling their healthcare coverage, they are going to not have access to preventative care, which is one of the most incredibly important,” Immigration Attorney, Maria Chavez said.

According to Covered California, more than 40,000 people are eligible to qualify for the program as DACA recipients. Of those, less than 2,000 people are enrolled.

Since everyone is required to have health insurance in California, if the Trump administration's proposal to cancel insurance access becomes a reality, DACA recipients might face steep financial penalties.

“If you don't have health insurance in California, you'll pay a penalty, $900 per adult, $450 per child that's not insured,” Yadira Lopez with Cover California said.

Others want to know more about the existing rule and proposed changes.

“My only thought is who's being denied benefits that are citizens, you know, what's the opportunity cost in providing medical care to nationals of other countries,” a man who asked to remain anonymous said.

Since Naputi had to take out a loan for healthcare coverage, she's married and is now covered under her husband's private health insurance plan.

Though she's covered, she is still concerned about fellow DACA recipients.

“One of my closest friends has a baby and she struggles. She can't afford health insurance for herself, let alone for her baby. She tries to find different avenues,” Naputi said.

The rule is in its proposal stage and public comments remain open until April 11.</p>

NEW YORK CITY, March  24, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sesame, the company that offers Americans quality, convenient health care at half the typical price, today announced a technical integration with LillyDirect Self-Pay Pharmacy Solutions dispensing provider Gifthealth. The integration makes the fulfillment experience for single-dose vials of Eli Lilly and Company's Zepbound® (tirzepatide) obesity medication more convenient and transparent for clinically eligible Sesame patients without insurance coverage for GLP-1 medications.

Streamlined access to authentic, FDA-approved, rigorously-tested Zepbound comes from Sesame's direct integration with Gifthealth.  Zepbound is the first and only FDA-approved dual glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) obesity medication.

Clinically eligible Sesame patients who receive a prescription for Zepbound will pay either $349 (for 2.5mg single-vial doses) or $499 (for 5mg, 7.5mg and 10mg single-vial doses) through LillyDirect Self Pay Pharmacy Solutions, powered by  Gifthealth.  The integration is part of “Success by Sesame,” the most clinically comprehensive – and affordable – direct-to-consumer weight loss program in America.  

“Life-changing, branded medications such as Zepbound should be infinitely more accessible to the eligible patients that so desperately need them,” said David Goldhill, Sesame‘s co-founder and CEO, and a serial author on American healthcare reform.  “Sesame is the only company unleashing marketplace dynamics to make dozens of types of outpatient care, including specialties like weight management, so much more affordable and accessible.”

"At Gifthealth, we believe that accessing critical medications like authentic Zepbound should be simple, affordable, and transparent,” said Robert Hoppe, EVP of Life Sciences at Gifthealth. “This integration with Sesame is another step forward in eliminating barriers to care by providing a seamless, frictionless experience for patients paying out-of-pocket. Together, we're making it easier for people to get the treatment they need—at the best available price—without the hassle."

About Success by Sesame

Success by Sesame offers Americans the most comprehensive clinical weight loss program without compromising Sesame's low-price promise:  The price of the program for consumers who receive prescriptions for FDA-approved, branded medications like Zepbound is just $89 (but does not include the price of the medication). This monthly price includes face-to-face video visits and unlimited messaging with a licensed provider, lab panels that are professionally reviewed and evaluated, and close clinical supervision throughout the patient's journey. 

Unlike other programs, Success by Sesame patients always choose their own dedicated care provider, who will discuss and prescribe the best treatment options that take into account the patient's medical history, health goals, insurance status, and budget.  

Sesame:  Putting patients ahead of medications

In addition to its marketplace model and catering to cash payers, Sesame differs significantly from its competition by placing the emphasis on comprehensive patient care, provider choice, and successful outcomes – not profiting off of specific medications.  Sesame's marketplace features hundreds of board-certified providers for patients to choose from. Whether a patient's care path includes branded GLP-1 medication or requires no medication at all, patients receive the highest level of personalized clinical care.

The lowest price can help hundreds of millions

According to the National Center for Health Statistics, nearly three-quarters of American adults over the age of 20 are overweight or obese, a staggering 246 million Americans.  At least 25 million Americans are uninsured.

Studies have demonstrated tirzepatide (Zepbound's active ingredient) to be one of the most effective weight loss medications available; in a 72-week clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine, patients taking 5mg, 10mg, and 15mg doses of tirzepatide once weekly lost an average of 15%, 19.5%, and 20.9% of their body weight, respectively. 

How Sesame always offers the best price

Sesame has built a unique healthcare marketplace where thousands of healthcare providers covering all 50 states compete to serve American consumers seeking high-quality, convenient medical care at half the typical price.

Sesame's marketplace effect lowers the price of care, makes prices transparent, drives added convenience (the majority of appointments on Sesame take place within two hours), and ensures a superior consumer experience.

Sesame is a cash-pay marketplace that does not accept health insurance, removing additional cost and complexity from the consumer's care.

ABOUT SESAME

Sesame is the company that offers Americans quality, convenient health care at half the typical price. The company's marketplace eliminates insurance, allowing healthcare providers to compete on quality, accessibility – and pricing.  Sesame was ranked #1 by Healthline for overall care in 2021, 2022, 2023,  2024, and 2025, as well as Best for Doctor Choice in 2023, 2024, and 2025 by Forbes and most affordable telehealth in 2023 by CNET.

Comprehensive Healthcare at 1250 SE Commercial Drive in College Place.

Less than two years ago, Nathan Davila was receiving services from Comprehensive Healthcare. Now, he provides those services to families in need of assistance.

As a team member of Comprehensive's Youth Mobile Outreach program, Davila uses his experiences to help local families work through their own issues.

“It feels really good to watch someone make progress,” Davila said. “For them to come in and they have no hope, nowhere to turn, and then we are graduating them and they're in an amazing spot, grades have improved, they're having better relationships, and their mindset has completely changed, that is enough impact for us to keep going.”

The outreach team is made up of five people, all with the same goal of helping families work through dysfunction and giving them the tools to do so. The program is meant to help youth who are in crisis, whether it is mental health issues, behavioral issues, substance use, or any other problem that is urgent but may not meet the criteria for higher level evaluations.

Comprehensive Healthcare's Youth Mobile Outreach team in Walla Walla helps families and youth work through issues, including mental health, substance use, behavioral problem and more. From left: Nathan Davila, Stephanie Beigel, Maddi Sprinkle, Lindsey Fuchs and Jared Ortiz.

The crisis-based program, which kicked off in summer 2024, typically lasts eight weeks, although it can be shorter or longer depending on each family's needs.

Most families are referred to Comprehensive Healthcare through the 988-crisis-hotline, local schools or primary care physicians. The team will then conduct an assessment with the referred family and decide whether the program is a good fit for them.

While the program looks different for each family, Davila said he mostly works with parents and guardians on building communication skills, trust, self-care and family roles and expectations.

" And some of the parents don't have anyone to talk to, so it's just being that person to listen,” Davila said. “They just need somebody to talk to and I can be that person."

While Davila mostly works with the parents or adults in the families, Maddi Sprinkle, the program's peer counselor, works exclusively with the children. She works in local schools and sees three to four students a day.

Sprinkle said she mostly helps students with anger management and coping skills, which will help with the trauma that many of them have experienced. She uses her own past experiences to let them know someone else has been where they are and understands what they're going through.

“I can help them in ways that maybe a clinical person cannot,” Sprinkle said. “So we just chat and go through what they're feeling that day, what they want to talk about and then we'll get some work done, like I'll bring coping skills worksheets or anger management worksheets.”

Like Davila, a big part of what Sprinkle does is being there to listen and help however she can, without pushing clients to do things or talk about things before they're ready.

She said she has one student who didn't want to talk for about two weeks, so they just played games together and she let him know he could talk whenever he wanted, but he didn't have to.

“It's actually seemed to be helping,” Sprinkle said. “We actually got a call from mom saying he's been a lot more open around home, more open to helping around the house, checking on her, and he's been opening up a lot more at meetings.”

Because the program is crisis-based and only about eight weeks, it is considered a "bridge program" that will help families through a period of acute distress before possibly moving on to a long-term service.

For Davila, it is sometimes difficult to bring families into the process and get them to engage. Often parents feel like the issue exists only within the youth and do not see that the whole family needs support, he said.

Care Coordinator Jared Ortiz acts as the main point of contact for the program, and he said working in the program had transformed team members into more patient people.

“I'm trying to give them (the clients) a little cushion into our services, not trying to force it on them and just kind of giving them their time to incorporate themselves into our program,” Ortiz said.

For many clients, the program is paid for through Medicaid or whatever insurance they have. If it is not, Comprehensive Healthcare has ways to eliminate the cost for families.

“That's something that families worry about — their stressors and barriers for financials,” said program director Lindsey Fuchs. “We don't want to make that a barrier for them to get care, so we take anybody and everybody.”

Fuchs said since the program started, it has become apparent just how limited the mental health resources for youth are in the area.

Three of the team members are now sitting on a coalition to advocate for youth and are trying to bring in more referrals and let people know the program exists.

"We knew that things were lacking out there, but once we got out there and were networking … we want to be part of the solution,” Fuchs said.

Washington, D.C. Newsroom, Mar 24, 2025 /
            08:00 am

Three U.S. representatives have introduced a bill that supports American taxpayers who choose to participate in health sharing, a care option favored by Christians and pro-lifers for its religious freedom protections.

If passed, the Health Care Sharing Ministry Tax Parity Act would designate health sharing payments as tax deductable, alleviating costs for families who opt for health sharing over traditional health coverage, many of whom do so for religious reasons. The act was introduced by U.S. Reps. Mike Kelly, R-Pennsylvania; Greg Murphy, R-North Carolina; and Chris Smith, R-New Jersey.

“Unfairly, Americans have been historically penalized by the tax code when they chose to use faith-based health care sharing ministries to meet their health care needs. The Health Care Sharing Ministry Tax Parity Act will remedy this problem, ensuring Americans are no longer disadvantaged by the tax code for their religious beliefs,” Smith said in a press release on March 14.

Health sharing became a popular alternative to mainstream insurance coverage over a decade ago with the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, which included a mandate from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services requiring insurance plans to fund contraception, sterilizations, and early abortion pills.

The practice allows members to pool their money and pay for each other's health care costs, similar to traditional insurance plans.

Legal disputes over religious freedom violations that precipitated from the Affordable Care Act continue today, with the Supreme Court set to hear a case in June regarding a part of the law governing preventative care.

“Americans should have choices when it comes to their health care. For many families, traditional insurance is a great option. For some, however, particularly people of faith, alternative options such as health care sharing ministries more closely align with their values,” Kelly said in the release.

“This legislation preserves that choice for families by allowing them to deduct payments made as part of their ministry membership in their taxes by classifying regular ministry expenses as medical care expenses,” he added. “It's time we focus on initiatives that reintroduce freedom and dignity back to our health care system.”

Solidarity HealthShare collaborated with the three congressmen on the legislation. Founded in 2012 in wake of the Affordable Care Act, Solidarity HealthShare facilitates health sharing among individuals and families across the country who are looking to opt out of traditional insurance for a more faith-centered option.

“Solidarity is grateful for the leadership and support of Congressman Mike Kelly and his team, who have consistently taken the lead in working for tax parity for health care sharing ministry members,” Solidarity HealthShare President Chris Faddis and CEO Brad Hahn told CNA in a statement.

“His introduction of the Health Care Sharing Ministry Tax Parity Act has the potential to be a game changer for families who have chosen to escape the troubled landscape of traditional health insurance but have been unable to benefit from tax deductions available to other Americans,” the executives added.

“This bill is the culmination of an industry-wide effort to provide tax relief to members of health care sharing ministries,” they said, adding: “We are also thankful for the support of the Alliance of Health Care Sharing and other health care sharing ministry partners for advancing this effort.”

Your monthly donation will help our team continue reporting the truth, with fairness, integrity, and fidelity to Jesus Christ and his Church.

Health sharing ministries can now seek accreditation from an independent Healthcare Sharing Accreditation Board, an option that will benefit both the organizations that promote themselves as an alternative to health insurance and their membership, a leading health sharing trade group has said.

Fertility awareness methods enable women to track their fertile cycles by charting one or more biomarkers. Couples can use this information to avoid or achieve pregnancy.

The youngest of James Lansberry's nine children almost didn't survive his birth. Born with no heartbeat, he was resuscitated and spent 11 days in the neo-natal intensive care unit. The medical bill was over $200,000.

, Contributor. 

Amidst the once-in-a-generation buzz around artificial intelligence, a new subject area has slowly but definitively gained steam in the last few years: quantum computing.

The concept has become especially popular over the last year, as the world's largest technology companies have started releasing some of their progress and work in this arena. Moreover, research has also emerged in recent months about how it can effectively solve some of the world's toughest data driven problems-- meaning that it has the potential to significantly transform healthcare and life-sciences in a positive manner.

But what exactly is quantum computing?

Well, its not just one thing; rather, the field encompasses a wide range of other important disciplines and studies, including quantum physics, mechanics, hardware and algorithms. Essentially, the entire study relies heavily on the foundational principles of quantum physics and the mechanics of subatomic particles to ultimately reveal and harness the realities of nature for productive compute.

There are four key principles of quantum physics which drive the breakthroughs in computing ability:

Applied to compute power and the ability to solve problems, quantum computing leverages these principles to perform tasks at a higher realm of efficiency and possibility. Classical compute uses bits (0 or 1 binary code) to read, store and process information; quantum computing instead uses “qubits” which can process similar information-- however, within the realms of the 4 principles mentioned above. For example, qubits can harness superposition, meaning that they can represent either 0 or 1 simultaneously and can therefore query more possibilities at a given time; this ability to process significantly more information simultaneously, along with the capabilities unlocked by the other principles, is what ultimately makes quantum computing so much more powerful than classical computing.

Why is all of this important? Because this technology, though still in its infancy, enables potential breakthroughs across all domains of science and healthcare.

In the realm of AI, there are significant applications. For one, machine learning, which refers to the process and ability to analyze and generate insights from vast quantities of data, stands to gain tremendously with breakthroughs from quantum computing, given how it can enable previously impossible computational tasks.

For healthcare and life sciences, quantum computing can unlock new insights based on data that was previously too vast to be analyzed. Amazon Web Services describes how quantum chemistry has empowered new chemistry simulations and data configurations which can unlock entirely novel leaps into the worlds of drug discovery, material sciences and nanotechnology.

Other great applications exist in the clinical space as well. A paper published in the Journal of Informatics in Health and Biomedicine describes how this technology “can search large, unstructured datasets more efficiently than their classical counterparts, enabling more effective optimization of complex problems in healthcare and biomedical research.” Undoubtedly, unstructured data is a multi-hundred billion dollar problem in healthcare; with the transition of hospitals and healthcare data to EMRs and digital systems over the last two decades, few solutions exist to collate all of this information and provide meaningful insights. Though software stacks are emerging that can help process this information, the datasets will only continue to grow, and quantum computing can play a significant role in alleviating this issue.

With regard to other fields ranging from drug discovery and design to genomic sequencing, protein folding and other key biomedical research applications, quantum computing will unlock new ways to solve some of the most fundamental questions of life at a molecular and individual particulate level.

This is why large technology companies are in such a rush to pursue (perhaps silently) their work in this field. Just a few months ago, Google announced the launch of Willow, the company's quantum chip that is capable of immense computational capabilities: “Willow performed a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes that would take one of today's fastest supercomputers 10 septillion (that is, 1025) years — a number that vastly exceeds the age of the Universe.” Last month, Microsoft similarly announced its Majorana 1 chip, providing “a clear path to fit a million qubits on a single chip that can fit in the palm of one's hand.”

Interestingly, these innovations also require significant work in developing entirely new hardware stacks and physical materials. That's why hardware giants such as Nvidia, who are already leading in this space, have a huge leg up in developing quantum processing units (QPUs) and the future means to enable this work further.

Nevertheless, it must be noted that this field is not brand new, by any means; although news coverage and media buzz around this subject is just now gaining steam, these breakthroughs are actually the culmination of decades of science and research finally converging at a serendipitous moment in time.</p>

Healthcare B2B e-commerce platform Kyberlife has bagged $3 million in an investing round led by 5I Ventures. The sum was also raised from East Ventures, A2D Ventures, and NUS Alumni Ventures.

WHAT IT DOES

Founded in Singapore in 2021, the startup runs an online marketplace for sourcing critical healthcare equipment for use by academics, research laboratories, and other healthcare institutions. It claims to have streamlined the oft-lengthy and complex procurement process, reducing time by 40% on average. 

Connecting suppliers with laboratories, healthcare institutions, and research centres, the platform now features around 1.2 million products from 160 brands, including Merck, Eppendorf, and Sartorius, serving major customers such as the National University Singapore, Duke-NUS, Nanyang Technological University, and National Cancer Centre of Singapore. 

WHAT IT'S FOR

Kyberlife will utilise its fresh funds to onboard more suppliers onto its marketplace across Southeast Asia, particularly Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand. "The company aims to grow its vendor portfolio to ten times its current size within the next three years," the startup shared in a statement. It will also introduce new product categories such as laboratory instruments and chemical reagents, supporting clinical trials and pharmaceutical research in the region. 

The funds will also be invested in AI and data analytics so it can enable personalised product recommendations. 

MARKET SNAPSHOT

Beyond Southeast Asia, digital healthcare marketplace operators Flipkart+ Health and PharmEasy also sought to address challenges in the procurement of critical healthcare supplies across the region, particularly long sourcing processes, lead times and opaque pricing. 

In 2021, Indian online pharmacy PharmEasy bought Aknamed, adding healthcare supply chain management to its portfolio. The following year, Flipkart Group, also from India, entered the healthcare supply chain segment with Flipkart Health+ after taking a minor stake in e-pharmacy startup SastaSundar.

On a sunny weekday in Atlanta, a small crowd of people gathered for a rally outside of a labor union headquarters building.

The event, put together by Atlanta-area Democratic U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams, was attended mostly by union members and recently fired federal workers, including Ryan Sloane.

"I was fired by an anonymous email at 9 p.m. in the middle of a holiday weekend," he said.

Sloane is still seeking reinstatement, but he feels he no longer has much to lose by speaking out.

"I'm only here today because they cannot fire me twice," Sloane said.

When he received his termination notice, he was a few months into a job as a public affairs specialist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

At the CDC, his days were spent updating far-flung local TV, radio, and newspaper journalists about threats such as seasonal flu, measles, and food safety in their communities.

A judge has ordered the reinstatement of some fired federal employees, at least temporarily. But their jobs are still on the line.

Sloane said his former colleagues at the CDC whose jobs aren't yet in limbo are scared.

"They are terrified that their life's work is going to be deleted from servers and not backed up because it does not comport with the ideologies of the new administration," he said. "No one is benefiting from this."

From the end of January to mid-February, the Trump administration took offline some CDC webpages and froze external communications, including its widely read Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report epidemiological digest.

The webpages that were removed included CDC public health reports, datasets, and guidance on infectious diseases and sexual health. After a court order, some agency information was restored, at least for now.

But even temporary disruptions to CDC communications could have big ripple effects.

It is information that state and local health departments, hospitals, university researchers, and others rely on to help them respond to outbreaks.

"CDC is there to provide technical information, provide funding, provide support, but it's a collaborative work, working together to keep Americans safe," said former CDC Director Tom Frieden, who headed the agency from 2009 to 2017. He is now president and CEO of the nonprofit organization Resolve to Save Lives. "In this country, we have a patchwork or network of public health. It's really up to the local, city, and state health departments to get the job done."

City and state health agencies also need the collaboration of CDC experts to help investigate local disease outbreaks and other threats to public health.

A clinician who has worked at the agency for more than two decades pointed to the CDC's singular ability to send medical supplies and deploy highly specialized teams of scientists to help local communities identify and contain outbreaks. KFF Health News agreed not to use the clinician's name because she fears she will be fired for airing these views publicly.

"A lot of them are assigned to state and local health departments, so really even beyond individual positions, any funding cuts that the agency takes are also passed on to state and local health departments," the clinician said. "A lot of their budget comes from federal money as well."

The Trump administration has attempted to terminate hundreds of employees from the CDC alone, along with hundreds more workers at the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies with a U.S. health and safety role.

Many public health and science researchers are concerned about the cuts' impacts on the nation's ability to respond to threats — and about whether state and local public health departments will be able to keep communities healthy without the CDC's partnership.

Billionaire Elon Musk has said his Department of Government Efficiency intends to keep cutting federal agencies' budgets and staff, targeting what it calls "fraud."

"Anytime someone gets fired, it's always difficult. But with $36 trillion in debt, we have to reduce the size of the federal government," Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene told WABE during a March visit to the Georgia State Capitol.

Her district includes parts of suburban Atlanta about 30 miles from CDC headquarters.

Greene also chairs a House subcommittee also called "DOGE," for "Delivering on Government Efficiency."

"Fortunately, with all the investments that are being brought back into the country under President Trump, I really hope that those federal workers are able to find new jobs," she said.

She did not comment on whether local public health departments around the country would be able to work efficiently without the support of CDC experts who have been terminated.

But many U.S. public health experts are expressing concern.

The CDC has long been a key training ground for the next generation of U.S. public health researchers.

Emory University epidemiology professor Patrick Sullivan was one of them earlier in his career. The HIV expert previously worked at the CDC for about 15 years.

"When I started working in HIV prevention at CDC in the early 1990s, we didn't have the treatments that essentially allowed people living with HIV to have a full, healthy, normal lifespan," he said. "We didn't have the treatments that essentially allowed people living with HIV to have a test that people could take home to test themselves."

Sullivan said the progress he has seen over the last several decades gave him optimism, and that advances in HIV treatment and prevention are a great example of the importance of federal support for public health work.

"Discovery science and pharmacy science really have given us the tools that we need to end the HIV epidemic in the United States," he said.

But, to have those scientific tools without adequate public health staff or funding to use them, he said, will cost American lives.

One day Melissa Dietrich, a self-described farm girl from outside Fort Wayne, was like any other number of Americans spending hours on the phone to negotiate down a surprisingly high medical bill.

The next, she was whisked into the Indiana Statehouse to meet Gov. Mike Braun and his wife Maureen, whom Dietrich would sit next to at the State of the State address.

There, she served as a physical embodiment of one of Braun's foremost issues and one of the largest battles within the legislature: tackling the rising and opaque cost of health care.

The fight over health care costs at the Statehouse has been muddied by power, money and finger-pointing, as influential groups have pushed their own narratives about who to blame for high costs. The lobbying giants haven't even agreed on the basic question of whether Indiana actually has an outlier health care cost problem to begin with, though reputable studies insist the state does.

Industry leaders among hospitals, insurance and drug manufacturers spend several hundreds of thousands a year on lobbying and political contributions, landing frequently among the state's top spenders.

But Braun has effectively planted his flag in the debate, not only by expressing openly his skepticism of the hospital and insurance lobby, but by appointing Gloria Sachdev as his secretary of health ― the former director of the Employers' Forum of Indiana, which commissioned a series of studies directing the blame onto hospital fees.

Though the legislature has broadened its focus in recent years beyond just hospitals, looking at pharmacy benefit managers, physician noncompetes and price transparency, legislation targeting hospital bills have proven some of the toughest to negotiate.

Braun has already written roughly a dozen health-related executive orders attempting to enact more price and financial transparency, including one requiring a study of how much nonprofit hospitals pay to the community in the form of charity care, compared to the value of their tax exemptions. Meanwhile, lawmakers are debating a bill proposing price controls on the largest nonprofit hospitals, but it's already been scaled back.

"I don't think the last administration had any interest wrestling with the biggest industry in our state," Braun told IndyStar. "Now that we're getting some real conversation going, they're coming in and doing what they shouldn't be doing. They're trying to water down these reforms. They ought to be helping us more in terms of what they can do to reform themselves, not to perpetuate a broken status quo."

In the same speech where Braun said the issue has been in the past "too tough to tackle because of entrenched special interests," he gave a shoutout to Dietrich.

Dietrich's story is relatively simple, but emblematic: She's 49 years old, no major health issues to speak of, works nights for a national retailer and helps on the family farm. Just after moving to her current job in 2022, she went in for an annual wellness visit and bloodwork. She gave the provider her new insurance card.

Yet, she got a bill around $1,300, for what should have only cost her a copay of $35 with her new insurance. It was only after hours on the phone with her employer, her insurer and the hospital that she got the bill down to about $300.

"Everybody that I've talked to consistently rolls their head, rolls their eyes, not at me, but just at the situation, because everybody can relate to this," she said. "Some people unfortunately just suck it up because they don't have the time or the energy to fight back."

There's been no shortage of drama amid the rhetoric war, and there are powerful players on all sides.

When Sachdev, a pharmacist by trade, started leading the Employers' Forum in 2015, she unanimously heard from members that their highest pain point was the affordability of health care. She cold-called a Rand Corp. researcher to commission a study of the prices being paid by self-insured employers at Indiana hospitals, compared to what Medicare reimburses those hospitals for the same services.

In 2019, a second iteration came out looking at 25 states and gathering data from more than just self-insured employers. That study put Indiana's hospital prices at the top of the chart.

That caught the attention of Al Hubbard, founder of E&A Industries, former chair of Indiana Republican Party and an influential voice in Indiana policy circles. He formed a nonprofit Hoosiers for Affordable Healthcare and asked Sachdev to serve on the board.

A third Rand study released in September 2020 found Indiana's hospital prices were sixth highest out of 49 states. The following year, Indiana's legislative leaders cited this and a Harvard University study showing similar rankings in a letter to hospital and insurance executives urging them to find their own solutions or else legislators will force solutions upon them.

IU Health was the only large nonprofit hospital system to announce a price freeze to bring their prices in line with national averages. Otherwise, industry leaders' responses to that letter from lawmakers offered no specific plans.

So the 2023 legislative session saw some of the first attempts at tackling the hospital-price issue head-on. A House priority bill sought to penalize hospitals that don't keep their prices charged to commercial patients in line with a certain threshold ― a percentage of Medicare, modeled after the Rand studies. The Indiana Hospital Association pushes back against Rand's methodology with force, referencing studies of their own that argue Indiana is not actually an outlier and suggesting the real drivers of higher bills are prescription drug costs, health plan administrative costs and pricy physicians.

By session's end, that became a data-collection bill, punting real action to the 2025 legislative session.

Hence, 2024's six-way Republican primary for governor held significance for industry leaders. Two months before the election, IU Health CEO Dennis Murphy sent an email to about 25 of his hospital C-suite peers, imploring them to donate to the campaign of Brad Chambers, who he deemed most sensitive to the industry's concerns. And he specifically cautioned against Braun, whose ideas he said would "very harmful to our industry."

Hubbard, meanwhile, of Hoosiers for Affordable Healthcare, had given $10,000 to both Braun and Chambers by this point. He would go on to give Braun an extra $20,000.

Braun hasn't forgotten about what happened during his primary.

"They didn't like my running for governor because I've been talking about this," he said.

Relations seem to be smoother this year. The Indiana Hospital Association has new staff, including a new CEO, Scott Tittle, who says they've had "great conversations" with the administration and legislative leaders.

Murphy, too, the IU Health CEO, said he's had "productive discussions" with the administration.

"I'm not sure that I disagree with Gov. Braun that the price of health care needs to be managed and needs to come down," Murphy told IndyStar. "And I think we are working with the administration to figure out how to do that."

The predominant rhetoric over the years at the Indiana Statehouse, and corresponding price-controlling legislation, has placed the spotlight on the state's largest nonprofit hospitals ― systems taking in billions a year in revenue, such as IU Health, Ascension St. Vincent and Community Health Network.

Researchers broadly support the conclusion that hospital prices are what make the United States an outlier compared to other wealthy nations. The U.S. spent twice as much per capita on health as comparable countries in 2021, a Peterson Center on Healthcare and Kaiser Family Foundation study found, and inpatient and outpatient care is the largest category of health spending responsible for that variation.

Why? Because large, consolidated hospital systems can charge higher prices, argue economists like Loren Adler, associate director at the Center on Health Policy at the Brookings Institute.

"There often isn't any meaningful competition," he said. "These are generally profit maximizing entities trying to make money. ... At the end of the day, it's hospital prices, the per unit prices, are the thing that is the most out of whack with the rest of the world."

A study from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2022 found most of Indiana's metropolitan areas are considered "highly concentrated," meaning just one or two systems own all the hospitals in a given market. This study's analysis of 27 hospital mergers between 2005 and 2015 found an increase in prices by more than 10% post-merger.

Hospital leaders point to the complexity of health care pricing. Government payers ― those using Medicare or Medicaid ― make up two-thirds of patients at Indiana hospitals, according to data from the Indiana Hospital Association. By their calculation, the government reimburses for these patients at a rate that's below the cost of providing the care, and the state's Medicaid rate hasn't risen in decades. So hospitals cost-shift to commercial payers, a smaller segment of their revenue base, to make up for that.

Consolidation, too, is what has saved some rural hospitals from going away, Tittle argued.

"I'd suggest that consolidation... shouldn't be seen as a bad thing, but also making sure that Hoosiers have access to the care they need," he said.

They also point out, Hoosiers are unhealthy. Indiana routinely ranks in the bottom 10 states in terms of its health outcomes, such as rates of cancer, diabetes and infant mortality.

Patient advocates point to the hospitals' own audited financial statements, which show operating profit margins ranging ranging anywhere from -5% in recent lean years to 10% other years, depending on the system. They point to the millions hospital executives make in salaries, to the billions nonprofits hold in cash and investments. They point to the marble floors and art fixtures and water fountains adorning some of the largest hospitals' lobbies.

"They're just poor mouthing, but they're not hurting," Marni Jameson Carey, president of the advocacy group Power to the Patients, said of hospitals. "They should profit, but not excessively."

The hospitals argue margins around 5% and bountiful cash reserves are right on target for making sure they can continue operations indefinitely and weather any storms, from global pandemics to cyber attacks.

"We can't be the corner restaurant that didn't make it during COVID," Murphy said. "We have been here for 100 years, and we need to be here for another 100. We can't go away."

In various public statements, hospitals also generally point a finger at the power insurance companies wield over premiums.

Some advocates believe big hospitals and big insurers are equally complicit in a concentrated system where consumer-facing prices are hard to find. Braun is among this camp, as is Matt Bell, a lobbyist for Hoosiers for Affordable Healthcare. Like with hospitals, there are only a small handful of large insurance companies controlling the Indiana market.

"So where is the impetus for those two to ever enter into a negotiation on behalf of me as an employer?" Bell said. "They're co dependent, and that's what we've created with the big systems, in my opinion. They get mad when I call it a cabal, but it's a cabal."

But insurers argue they aren't actually on equal footing with the hospitals. Some hospital systems institute "all or nothing" clauses, which say that in order for them to accept a certain insurance network, that network has to take on all the hospitals within that system. Meanwhile, insurers are federally required to have enough doctors in network within a certain distance of all its members. In other words, a given insurer might need a certain hospital more than the hospital needs the insurer. (House Bill 1003 this session would ban all-or-nothing clauses.)

"Negotiations with the systems are barely negotiations," said Marty Wood, president of the Insurance Institute of Indiana. "The hospitals have the upper hand across the board."

On the other hand, advocates argue insurance companies don't have incentive to push back. The Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to spend 80% of their revenue from premiums on health care and the remaining 20% on administrative costs and profits. But 20% of a bigger number is just a bigger number.

"So the insurance companies pretend that they're negotiating to the lowest possible price," Carey, of Power to the Patients, said. "If the hospitals charge more, and they just shrug and say, 'Oh, the prices are going up. Too bad.'"

After her ordeal, Dietrich decided she'd rather drive out of state for care.

That's because she found a direct primary care provider, a model in which she pays an upfront monthly membership fee to access primary care services without insurance.

So when she needs the occasional checkup or quick fix ― like the piece of wood lodged in her thumb a month ago from working on the farm ― she now drives to a strip-mall DPC office two and a half hours away, in Detroit.

"The only way that I can see to pare it down, is to cut the fluff, get rid of the nonsense," she said. "We're tired of the nonsense."

According to a recent study by Jackson National Life Insurance Company, there is a notable gap between individuals' perceptions of health care and long-term care retirement costs and their overall financial preparedness, underscoring the need for better retirement planning.

“Retirement should be a time for security and stability; however, our research shows many households may be unprepared for the realities of the healthcare challenges and expenses they will face,” said Glen Franklin, assistant vice president of Research, RIA and Lead Generation Strategy for Jackson National Life Distributors LLC, the marketing and business distribution of Jackson.

“These new survey data should be a wakeup call for policymakers, financial professionals and older Americans themselves,” said Andrew Eschtruth, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. “We are particularly concerned that too many people nearing or in retirement don't have a good grasp of their potential healthcare needs and out-of-pocket costs, which could narrow their options when it comes time to pay the bills.”

Key findings from the research include:

“Our research is particularly timely given potential policy shifts resulting from the election outcome, as proposals addressing healthcare reform and federal funding for long-term care programs could significantly impact retirees' healthcare costs and savings strategies. This further underscores the importance of working with financial professionals to prepare for an evolving landscape and proactively address healthcare risks in investors' retirement plans."

When respondents were asked for their best estimate of how much money they and—if applicable—their spouse/partner will spend per year after they retire for out-of-pocket healthcare costs, including doctors, hospitals, prescription drugs, vision care, and dentistry, 35% of them estimated less than the median amount of $4,000/year, while 23% could not make an estimation, said Franklin. Meanwhile, he added, 80% of respondents think that someone in poor health would spend more than $5,000 per year on out-of-pocket healthcare costs alone, while respondents in poor health actually report an average of $4,700 per year for total healthcare expenses.

And when respondents were asked for their best estimate of how much money they and—if applicable—their spouse/partner will spend per year after they retire on all health insurance costs, 57% estimated less than the likely range of $10,000-15,000 per year, while 34% could not make an estimation. Then when they were asked how much they think it would cost annually to get around-the-clock, long-term care in their home, 38% estimated less than the likely range of $75,000 or more. For the annual cost of the average nursing home in their area, 58% estimated less than the likely range of $100,000 or more.

Underestimating costs can negatively affect a consumer's financial and retirement planning. As Franklin pointed out, “underestimating what is likely to be the largest expense in retirement can result in failure to identify sufficient sources of guaranteed income to cover necessities, or depletion of financial assets with many years left to live—both of which could cause a dramatic decline in lifestyle or—in the worst case—financial insolvency and the inability to maintain independence.”

So, what are some of the steps that advisors can take to teach their clients about these costs and help them take a proactive approach to their financial planning? Sharing the basic facts is a great start, said Franklin. In surveying financial professionals, he said that 53% reported that they do not discuss Medicare, Medicare Advantage or supplemental health insurance with any of their clients. Moreover, 59% reported that they do not discuss the financial risk of needing long-term care with any of their clients. “Their clients cannot properly prepare for retirement if they do not have a full picture of the major costs involved with retirement,” he pointed out.

The research, conducted between July 12 and August 2, 2024, included online surveys of more than 400 financial professionals and 500 investors with at least $100,000 in financial assets and between the ages of 48 and 78. Respondents were required to participate in or lead household financial decision-making.

The study is the third installment of Jackson's Security in Retirement Series, conducted in partnership with the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, and follows the initial longevity risk and inflation risk studies, which were released over the past 15 months. Jackson said that this multi-phased research initiative aims to provide useful, actionable and research-based insights on many potential threats to financial security in retirement.

Opinion articles provide independent perspectives on key community issues, separate from our newsroom reporting.

Right now, politicians in Washington are debating the future of Medicaid. They throw around big numbers and rhetoric around “waste,” “fraud,” and “abuse.” For too many politicians in Washington, Medicaid is just another political football to be tossed around as red meat rhetoric to throw to their bases in hopes of securing their next campaign donation.

But Medicaid is not a political football to us, nor is it some abstract political debate. To us it is literally a lifesaver. 

As the parents of two children adopted out of the foster care system who suffer from complex medical issues, Medicaid is the difference between providing for our family or not. 

And it is not just us. For millions of other families just like ours, Medicaid isn't just a safety net — it's a critical part of our survival and well-being, providing access to essential services and care that we would otherwise be unable to afford. The importance of Medicaid cannot be overstated, particularly for families dealing with chronic conditions, disabilities and other long-term medical challenges.

In our family, our 5-year-old daughter has had six hospitalizations and four ambulance rides to deal with her complex health issues. Our son, who is 7 years old, navigates Autism and ADHD. Medicaid has paid for all their treatments, and if it weren't for Medicaid, we would easily be bankrupt, twice over. 

What often gets lost in the political debate is that Medicaid is the backbone of American health care, covering more than 72 million people across race, income, and geography. It funds health care for nearly half of all births, two-thirds of nursing home residents and millions of people with disabilities. 

Medicaid offers comprehensive coverage, including doctor visits, hospital stays, prescription medications, and specialty services. These services are not optional for families with complex medical needs like ours. They are vital to maintaining the health and quality of life for our children. In fact, for our family, and millions like us, Medicaid provides the only means of accessing necessary therapies, medical devices and specialized medical care. 

And now, Republicans and President Donald Trump in Washington are contemplating cutting the program so they can pay for tax cuts of billionaires. That would be a devastating outcome for our family.

We are a veteran and a school teacher. We have served our nation and our community. And our kids deserve better than politicians who will sell out our healthcare so billionaires, who already get extensive tax cuts, can get even richer. 

Medicaid is not a political football. It is not a bargaining chip to be sold away. It is even more than just an insurance program — it is a lifeline for families with complex medical needs. It ensures our loved ones can access the care they need to thrive without the crushing weight of financial strain. In one of the wealthiest nations on earth, no family should have to choose between lifesaving medical care for their children and being able to put food on their table.

Medicaid works. We should be working to strengthen and expand it, not gut it. Our kids, and millions of others across the country, deserve high-quality health care.

Gridlocked traffic is the last place Jorge De Apodaca wants to be after his cancer treatment appointment. Dizziness and “foggy brain” don't go well with bumper-to-bumper traffic.

The 68-year-old's commute is now a bit easier since the University of Miami Health System expanded to Doral, one of the fastest growing cities in the state. While De Apodaca and his wife still have to slog through traffic, the drive from their Miami Lakes home to Doral is shorter than to UHealth's Kendall location, where he had undergone treatment

Every time he walks into UHealth's new medical center at Downtown Doral, the staff offers him snacks and coffee, the UM graduate said. During a recent visit, he was given a free lymphatic massage to help his swollen feet. And he has a nice view of the city while he's getting treatment from an upper floor. 

“It's a healing environment,” he said. “It heals the soul, takes out the stress, which obviously helps the cancer.”

UM's health system, which shares a main campus with Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami's Health District, is the newest health giant to expand its footprint into Doral, offering primary care as well as cardiology, oncology, urology, cancer treatment and outpatient surgeries. Patients can usually go home the same day of a procedure at the new center, 8375 NW 53rd Ter.

“No one and their families like to be in a hospital,” said Dr. Dipen Parekh, UHealth's chief operating officer. “And because of the advances in medicine ... we are able to deliver some of the most complex care without the patients having to spend the night in the hospital.” 

The U's expansion into Doral advances the city's position as South Florida's newest medical hub. Growing Doral is home to more than 80,000 residents and over 17,000 businesses, and close to highways and the airport. 

The move west is part of UHealth's plan to bring care closer to patients, a strategy to not only improve access to care, but to also attract and retain patients and employees. 

“It's location, location, location,” said Manuel Pila, the economic developer for the city of Doral, echoing the familiar real estate refrain about a home for sale in a desirable neighborhood. “The opportunity was here, the space was here, and the growing population was here.”

Doral, a city once filled with sprawling fields of cows and warehouses, is now full of houses, apartments, condos, restaurants, shops, hotels, schools and parks. And it's projected to keep growing, with the city's population expected to balloon to over 100,000 by 2030. 

Baptist Health South Florida, the region's largest health system, ventured into Doral in 1990 after seeing an opportunity to provide care to a “medically underserved” and growing population, said Ana Lopez-Blazquez, executive vice president and chief strategy officer at Baptist Health.

“Early on, Doral had the recipe for success,” she said, noting that Baptist's presence in the city has “grown over the years based on the needs of that community.”

In February, Baptist opened a standalone cancer center offering chemotherapy, infusion and radiation. Baptist also has a hospital, ER, and a primary and urgent care center in the city. 

“Expanding our cancer care services to Doral represents an important step in providing high-quality treatment options and resources for more patients closer to home,” Dr. Michael Zinner, CEO and executive medical director of Miami Cancer Institute and Baptist Health Cancer Care, said in a statement earlier this year announcing the opening. “For us, it's not just about growth, but empowering the community to better prioritize their health.”

Doral's rapid growth has everyone's attention — families, real estate developers, businesses and the health industry.

Miami-Dade's public safety net hospital system, Jackson Health, opened the 98-bed Jackson West hospital four years ago. Nicklaus Children's Health System, with outpatient and urgent care centers across the region, has cared for thousands of patients since its Doral outpatient and urgent center opened in 2008. The center, which also offers dental and rehab, saw more than 50,000 patients in 2024.

While Doral has seen an explosion of healthcare growth, medical centers, outpatient, urgent care and standalone emergency rooms are also popping up across South Florida as hospitals compete for patients.

UHealth will open a new seven-story medical center in North Miami-Dade later this year, part of a mega-development of residential towers, to serve Aventura, North Miami and surrounding areas. Miami's Mercy Hospital now has a standlone ER in Kendall. And Miami Beach's Mount Sinai Medical Center plans to open a standalone emergency room in Westchester.

“Every major system is expanding. The whole area is hot now,” although some locations are hotter then others, including Doral, Aventura, North Miami, and parts of Palm Beach County, said Johnathan Peavy. He's the operations manager for the Fort Lauderdale office of Robins & Morton, a company that specializes in healthcare-related construction. 

The Alabama firm, which oversaw the construction of UHealth Doral, is working on several South Florida projects, including UHealth at SoLé Mia in North Miami-Dade, and Baptist Health's new rehabilitation hospital in South Miami.

Everyone seems to want a piece of the South Florida market, including President Donald Trump, whose company plans to build luxury condos at the edge of Trump's golf course resort in Doral.

Health systems are also trying to keep up with South Florida's growth and are searching for “pockets” in the community where clusters of people live or are moving to that don't have nearby health services, according to Peavy. But hospitals are also facing a challenging real estate market, where “prices are through the roof” and limited land to build.

He expects South Florida's healthcare market will continue to heat up, from Homestead in South Miami-Dade to Martin County on Florida's Treasure Coast.

For patients, the expansion of health services into neighborhoods mean it's a lot easier to find care close to home. For health systems, the push into the suburbs isn't just to improve access to care, one of several factors that can affect a person's health. It's also a chance to secure lifelong patients, reduce overcrowding at main locations, and prepare for the future.

Hospitals aren't just competing for patients, but also for nurses and doctors during a nationwide shortage predicted to get worse by 2030, when the youngest Baby Boomers — people born between 1946 and 1964 — hit 65. Health experts worry there won't be enough healthcare providers to meet the needs of an aging population. 

Executives bet a shorter work commute — a benefit that comes from opening medical centers across neighborhoods — could help improve retention and hiring. 

And while many people have moved out of South Florida due to rising costs, some parts of the region are seeing the arrival of younger families. Miami Beach, once a popular retirement destination for seniors, now has a younger, and fitness-friendly crowd of residents. Doral has more families moving in. Sweetwater is trying to reinvent itself into a college town. 

For some health giants, the strategy to attract young and old patients has even lured some across county borders.

Memorial Regional, one of two public hospital systems in Broward, opened a primary care center a few years ago in Northwest Miami-Dade, near Hialeah and Miami Lakes. Memorial opened the center after seeing a big need for preventive and specialty care in an area that is home to more than 500,000 people.

Nicklaus Children's, whose hospital near South Miami is considered to be one of the state's top pediatric hospitals, recently struck deals to become the primary pediatric provider of public hospital system Broward Health and the exclusive pediatric teaching hospital of Florida International University's medical college.

Patients can find Baptist Health South Florida, FIU's future teaching hospital, all over the place with urgent care centers, ERs and medical offices. The newest location is a freestanding ER in Miami Lakes, which offers the same emergency care as a hospital ER, but usually has shorter wait times and is not physically connected to the hospital. 

“It's demand and supply,” said Parekh, the UHealth executive. UHealth noticed many of its patients lived in Doral and were trekking across South Florida's congested roadways to seek care at its centers in Miami and Coral Gables, with some even going as far as Broward County.

“The constant feedback we received from the community was that they wished that UHealth had a presence in Doral,” Parekh said. Doral's “culture of live, work, play is such an integral part of this community ... we decided it was time for the University of Miami Health System to really make a significant presence in the community.”

It's not just hospitals trying to gain ground in Doral. Leon Medical Centers vans drive around town, taking seniors to and from its Doral center. Sanitas Medical Center, which houses health insurer Florida Blue's center, and other doctor offices and medical centers are scattered across the city. Dentists, orthodontists, physical therapists, plastic surgeons have moved in. Companies that specialize in biotechnology, medical equipment and other health-related products and services are also setting up shop in Doral's warehouses, according to Pila.

Like the rest of Miami-Dade County, small businesses make up the majority of Doral's commerce, although you'll also find chain restaurants, hotels and other large companies scattered across the city including Walmart, Amazon, Carnival Corp. and Trump National Doral within the boundaries. The healthcare and social assistance areas, along with professional, scientific and technical services are part of the city's top industries for employment.

“Doral has a unique blend,” said Peavy, noting that the centrally located city is continuing to see growth in its high-rise and multi-family market, while also maintaining a robust market for manufacturing and other businesses.

And Doral's economy is continuing to see growth in industries that require employees to have a high level of skill and knowledge, according to a 2024 economic analysis report prepared for the city in partnership with Florida International University's Jorge M. Pérez Metropolitan Center. This includes the science and healthcare field, which the city is keen on attracting because of the opportunities for high-paying jobs and other economic growth, the report states.

Doral's proximity to Miami International Airport is why BioTissue in 2012 opened its production facility in the city when it decided to leave Kendall and expand its operations, said Michael Cornelius, the company's chief financial officer.

BioTissue, formerly known as TissueTech, specializes in re-purposing donated birth tissue —umbilical cords, placenta, ambiotic fluid, and other tissue that is traditionally discarded after live birth — to create medical products that can help treat and speed up recovery for eye conditions, burns, wounds and injuries. Birth tissue is often used in reconstructive procedures and is known to help reduce pain, inflammation, and scar formation. 

Birth tissue-products are stored at below freezing temperatures to retain their viability and effectiveness and are also shipped in special containers. That's why being near the airport is key to operations, the executive said.

“We have patients all around the country. So, getting from production to Miami airport on a FedEx plane and to Memphis overnight and then out to various hospitals and doctors offices, next day, is really important for us,” Cornelius said.

But finding space to build isn't the only challenge in Doral.

The city is “over-burdened” by road congestion, according to FIU's economic report. 

So, no matter that medical centers are moving closer to the people, one problem persists:

Traffic is a headache.

LEXINGTON, Ky. (March 24, 2025) — Children's Miracle Network Hospitals (CMNH) announced today that its partners raised a record $2,318,299.22 for Kentucky Children's Hospital (KCH) in 2024. The amount is up 23% from last year's total. 

CMNH community partners such as Speedway, Walmart and Dairy Queen answered the call to support the Commonwealth's most vulnerable patients. Each of those companies are deeply embedded in the communities they serve. To those partners, the Kentucky families served by CMNH and KCH aren't just customers, they are friends and neighbors. 

“Knowing that the dollars donated at our registers, and raised through the events our associates loving put together each year, stay local at KCH means everything to us,” said Jaime Campbell, regional market manager for Walmart.  

“Our mission to provide the best care for children is made possible by the generosity of our community,” said Scottie B. Day, M.D., physician-in-chief at KCH. “This support directly benefits our young patients and their families, giving them hope and healing.” 

Funds raised by Children's Miracle Network partners support several projects at KCH, including animal therapy, providing sensory items to clinics and lifesaving research.  

More than 30 partner companies support Kentucky Children's Hospital through CMNH campaigns, such as selling Miracle Balloons, hosting events and asking customers to “round up” or donate change at their cash registers.   

Funds raised by CMNH partners have transformed spaces in the hospital and pediatric specialty clinics, named for community partners including Speedway, Walmart and McLane. Those funds also supported new ambulance transports that are specially designed and equipped for pediatric patients. 

UK HealthCare is the hospitals and clinics of the University of Kentucky. But it is so much more. It is more than 10,000 dedicated health care professionals committed to providing advanced subspecialty care for the most critically injured and ill patients from the Commonwealth and beyond. It also is the home of the state's only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, a Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit that cares for the tiniest and sickest newborns, the region's only Level 1 trauma center and Kentucky's top hospital ranked by U.S. News & World Report. 

As an academic research institution, we are continuously pursuing the next generation of cures, treatments, protocols and policies. Our discoveries have the potential to change what's medically possible within our lifetimes. Our educators and thought leaders are transforming the health care landscape as our six health professions colleges teach the next generation of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health care professionals, spreading the highest standards of care. UK HealthCare is the power of advanced medicine committed to creating a healthier Kentucky, now and for generations to come. </p>

Recruiting and retaining allied healthcare professionals in long-term care have been at the forefront across the sector since the start of the pandemic. One company that has been training certified nurse assistants, medical assistants, pharmacy assistants and others for a decade and a half recently spoke with the McKnight's Business Daily.

MedCerts provides programs for prospective allied healthcare professionals to earn their credentials without earning a two- to four-year college degree.

Chief Product Officer Dana Janssen told the McKnight's Business Daily that Michigan-based MedCerts was one of the first traditional online or e-learning providers in the country 15 years ago.

“We had a running start before the pandemic, and of course, once the pandemic hit, it did two things. It inspired a lot of other schools to make the transition to online,” he said. “But one of the biggest benefits, if you want to call it a benefit, of the pandemic was far greater acceptance of online training within Allied Health, because traditionally there was some pushback on can you actually teach these skills, clinical skills, in an online way.”

“Quite frankly, because we had that running start, we had already invested in a number of different types of training that are highly digitized, highly engaging and immersive, where we simulate clinical skills being performed,” he said.

MedCerts CEO Craig Sprinkle said the company's online training programs are flexible and make it easier for people to get the skills and certifications they need for healthcare jobs. 

“This opens doors for students while also helping employers fill critical roles faster,” he said. “And really, whenever you focus on where the majority of the vacancies are and dig into that a little bit more, it's in those frontline allied healthcare professions that, frankly, are the backbone of patient care at the end of the day.

Dana Janssen added that 60% of all healthcare workers are allied healthcare professionals.

Regarding labor challenges faced by operators, Sprinkle said, he believes that there are plenty of individuals willing to learn to step into roles in allied healthcare.

“It's just being able to connect those learners with the opportunities to be able to obtain the training that then prepares them to step into the roles that are in demand,” he said.

According to Sprinkle, there is a “general misconception” that the only path, in terms of making a step into healthcare, is via a two-or a four-year degree. Training such as that offered by MedCerts, he said, is more specialized and more targeted, which “really helps that person more seamlessly step into those professions more so than somebody that's gone to school for two years, somebody that's gone to school for four years.”

MedCerts enrollees must be high school graduates or the equivalent or have a parent's signature to participate in a program. Although high school students can't sit for a certification exam until they graduate, they can take the exam as soon as they graduate and then enter the allied healthcare workforce immediately.

On average, Sprinkle said, the programs take five to six months to complete, with an average cost of $4,000.

That doesn't necessarily mean a student needs to pony up $4,000 in tuition, Janssen said. The company partners with healthcare employers around the country, and if an employer is sponsoring a program, then tuition generally is covered by the employer, either through tuition assistance or tuition reimbursement programs.

MedCerts' online programs are self-paced, allowing students to progress independently on their own schedule. The clinical portions are overseen by healthcare facilities that partner with MedCerts to provide hands-on training opportunities, Sprinkle said.
