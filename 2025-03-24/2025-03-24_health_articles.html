**Scientific Validity & Clinical Potential**

Microdosing psychedelics, such as LSD and psilocybin, is gaining attention for potential mental health benefits.

Early studies suggest improvements in mood, creativity, and cognition, but evidence remains limited.

Most research relies on self-reports, with placebo-controlled trials showing mixed results.

While neurobiological mechanisms indicate possible antidepressant effects, long-term safety and efficacy are unclear.

Regulatory challenges and inconsistent dosing further complicate clinical adoption.

More rigorous, large-scale studies are needed to validate therapeutic claims.

Until then, microdosing remains an intriguing yet unproven intervention, requiring cautious exploration within controlled settings.

**The Therapeutic Potential of Microdosing Psychedelics in Depression**

Research suggests that microdosing psychedelics may have antidepressant effects.

Studies have shown improved mood and cognitive function in individuals with depression who received microdoses of LSD or psilocybin.

However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the long-term safety and efficacy of microdosing.

**Neural Mechanisms Underlying Psilocybin's Therapeutic Potential**

Psilocybin has been shown to have neurobiological mechanisms that indicate possible antidepressant effects.

Studies have used electrophysiology to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying psilocybin's therapeutic potential.

These studies suggest that psilocybin may have a positive effect on brain activity and connectivity.

**Impact of Psilocybin on Cognitive Function**

Research has investigated the impact of psilocybin on cognitive function in individuals with depression.

Studies have shown improved cognitive performance, including enhanced executive function and working memory.

However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the long-term effects of psilocybin on cognition.

**Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) of Microdose Clinical Trials**

Microdose clinical trials raise ethical, legal, and social implications that need to be addressed.

Researchers have investigated the ELSI of microdose clinical trials and identified several challenges and concerns.

These include ensuring informed consent, addressing regulatory issues, and managing potential risks and benefits.

**The Emerging Field of Psychedelic Psychotherapy**

Psychedelics are being increasingly recognized as a potential therapeutic tool for treating mental health disorders.

Research has shown that psychedelics can have rapid and long-lasting effects on symptom improvement.

However, more research is needed to establish the safety and efficacy of psychedelic psychotherapy.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The author has been invited to speak at women's history events and chooses to talk about lesser-known women from history.

I’ve thought a lot about the unknown women in the migraine community. I know they’re there. I’m intrigued by who the powers-that-be opt to include in history lessons versus those who remain in obscurity.

What I do know is that women are often more impacted by chronic migraine. Migraine is three times more likely to impact women than men. Migraine affects 30% of women over a lifetime. The frequency, duration, and intensity of migraines in women tend to be greater.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

I always saw my eczema as a weakness, but I now realize that while eczema has taken a lot from me, it has allowed me to appreciate my empathic side. For years I’ve endured the stares of strangers and sometimes even peers, but in doing so, I’ve also become more attuned to the struggles of others. So when I walk past someone with a visible ailment, I see them, not just their condition but their resilience, daily battles, and quiet strength.

I truly believe there’s an unspoken connection among those of us with visible conditions. It’s a silent acknowledgment that only we know what it’s like to be judged for something beyond our control within the first few seconds. This vow of silent acknowledgment allows us to move forward despite the odds. My empathy for others allowed me to build one of my greatest strengths.

Another surprise with eczema is that it didn’t just disrupt my days, but it stole my nights too. I never realized how deeply it would impact my sleep until I found myself trapped in an exhausting cycle of relentlessly itching nights. I would scratch until my skin bled and became discolored, waking up to a sea of flakes, raw patches, and an overwhelming sense of fatigue.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Body size and excess weight are well-established risk factors for many types of cancer.

The study, conducted by Dr Ming Sun, Dr Josef Fritz, and Dr Tanja Stocks from Lund University in Sweden, analyzed data from 339,190 individuals who had undergone health assessments with BMI and WC assessments from 1981-2019.

Established obesity-related cancers were defined as those for which the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has concluded there is sufficient evidence linking them to obesity.

The authors calculated relative risks associated with obesity-related cancers for WC and BMI, taking into account multiple factors that could influence the results.

Because WC is harder to measure accurately and consistently than BMI, its values tend to vary more. 

The researchers adjusted for measurement errors in both WC and BMI to ensure a fair comparison.

During a median follow-up of 14 years, 18,185 established obesity-related cancers were recorded.

In men, a WC increase of approximately 11 cm was associated with a 25% higher risk of developing obesity-related cancers.

By comparison, a BMI increase of 3.7 kg/m² corresponded to a 19% increased risk.

High WC still remained a risk factor for obesity-related cancer in men after accounting for BMI.

This suggests that the elevated risk associated with abdominal adiposity is specific and not explained by high body size alone.

Among women, the associations were weaker and similar for both WC and BMI.

For example, both an increase of about 12 cm in waist circumference and an increase of 4.3 kg/m² in BMI were associated with a 13% higher risk of developing obesity-related cancers.

BMI is a measure of body size, but does not provide information on fat distribution.

Waist circumference is a proxy more closely related to abdominal adiposity.

Visceral fat, which accumulates around the abdominal organs, is more metabolically active and has been implicated in adverse health outcomes.

Individuals with similar BMIs may have distinct cancer risks due to differences in fat distribution.

A plausible explanation for the difference between men and women is that men are more likely to store fat viscerally.

Including hip circumference into risk models may provide further insights into this sex difference.

Research has indicated that adiposity, especially central adiposity, leads to higher concentrations of circulating insulin in men than in women.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250324/Simple-urine-test-may-spare-kidney-cancer-patients-from-invasive-scans.aspx'>Simple urine test may spare kidney cancer patients from invasive scans</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 00:00:00 <p>
A simple urine test could accurately show the recurrence of kidney cancer at an early stage, potentially sparing patients invasive scans and enabling faster access to treatment.

The findings are presented today [Monday 24 March 2025] at the European Association of Urology (EAU) Congress in Madrid and have been accepted for publication in European Urology Oncology. The test analyses the distinctive profiles of certain types of sugar molecules, called glycosaminoglycans which are found in urine.

These profiles are known as the GAGome. The international AURORAX-0087A (AUR87A) study is assessing whether a GAGome test can accurately detect the return of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) following surgery.

This is the most common form of kidney cancer and accounts for up to 90% of cases. There are around 400,000 patients diagnosed with ccRCC worldwide each year. Around one-fifth of ccRCC patients who have surgery to remove their cancer will see it return within five years – the majority within the first two years.

Currently, the only way to monitor patients is through a scan – usually a CT scan – every 6 to 12 months, with the frequency depending on their level of risk. The study's initial cohort involved 134 patients treated at 23 hospitals across the UK, EU, USA and Canada.

The patients were all diagnosed with ccRCC which had not spread beyond the kidney, and which was treated with surgery. Most had their kidney completely removed. All patients continued to have CT scans as standard monitoring after surgery, alongside a urine test every 3 months.

Each urine sample was analysed using mass spectrometry to produce a score out of 100, called the GAGome score. After up to 18 months of follow up, 15% of patients had seen their cancer return. The GAGome test was extremely sensitive in picking up recurrence, correctly identifying 90% of patients whose cancer had returned.

The GAGome test was correct in ruling out just over half of those who remained cancer-free. These results were based on a GAGome score threshold optimised at 12/100. A score above 12 was counted as positive, and 12 or below as negative.

A positive result in the study yielded a 26% chance the patient actually had a recurrence. More importantly, a negative GAGome score resulted in a highly reliable 97% chance that the patient did not have a recurrence. The higher the GAGome score, the more likely the positive result correctly identified recurrence.

This level of accuracy is similar to CT scans and offers advantages to using scans alone, according to lead researcher on the study, Saeed Dabestani, Associate Professor at Lund University and Consultant Urologist at Kristianstad Central Hospital, Sweden.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250324/Epstein-Barr-virus-triggers-inflammatory-cell-death-in-ulcerative-colitis.aspx'>Epstein-Barr virus triggers inflammatory cell death in ulcerative colitis</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 00:00:00 <p>
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing disease that causes painful inflammation and ulcers in the colon.

While its exact causes remain elusive, mounting evidence suggests that viral infections, particularly Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), may worsen disease severity.


Elevated EBV DNA and RNA levels have been detected in the colonic tissues of UC patients, correlating with more aggressive symptoms, higher risks of surgery, and poorer treatment responses.


In a pivotal study published on January 21, 2025, researchers from West China Hospital, Sichuan University, investigated the role of EBV in UC by analyzing tissue samples from UC patients and conducting experiments in mouse models infected with murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68).


The team uncovered a critical connection between EBV infection and macrophage-driven inflammation.


Their results highlight a previously unknown mechanism that amplifies UC symptoms.


The study revealed that EBV infection dramatically increases the levels of pyroptosis-related proteins, including Gasdermin D, NLRP3, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-18 (IL-18), in the colon.


Macrophages infected with EBV exhibited excessive inflammatory responses, leading to severe intestinal damage and compromised gut integrity.


Notably, the researchers identified glycolysis as a central driver of this process—fueling the inflammation that worsens UC.

When the team blocked glycolysis using the metabolic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), macrophage pyroptosis was significantly reduced, leading to decreased inflammation in the colitis-afflicted mice.

These findings establish a direct link between EBV, metabolic dysregulation, and immune activation in UC.


Dr. Hu Zhang underscored the importance of these discoveries: "Our research provides compelling evidence that EBV actively contributes to UC severity by triggering inflammatory cell death in macrophages."


The study suggests that targeting glycolysis could offer a new therapeutic avenue—one that specifically combats EBV-induced inflammation while preserving immune function.

Additionally, antiviral treatments that directly suppress EBV replication could be explored as adjunct therapies for UC patients with confirmed EBV infections.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250324/Researchers-develop-tool-to-enhance-NK-cells-against-cancer.aspx'>Researchers develop tool to enhance NK cells against cancer</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 00:00:00 <p>
A team of researchers from the Hospital del Mar Research Institute, the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, and the Pompeu Fabra University has developed a new tool to modify NK cells to make them immune to tumor's defense mechanism.

Among other functions, NK cells have the capacity to detect and eliminate cancer cells. But in some cases they cannot overcome the tumor's defense mechanism and the cancer grows.

To strengthen the capacity of NK lymphocytes to eliminate tumors, researchers used CRISPR/Cas9, a genetic editing tool, to eliminate a gene from these cells and make them resistant to two molecules that produce tumor cells.


The goal of the study was to confirm whether modified NK cells had the capacity to overcome the negative effects of TGF-β and Activin A molecules in preclinical models of HER2 positive breast cancer tumor cells and metastatic colorectal cancer cells.

The results, both in vitro and in mice models, demonstrate that the genetically modified NK cells are capable of reaching the tumors, penetrating and destroying them.


To achieve these effects, researchers deactivated a specific gene, SMAD4, involved in the signaling of TGF-β and Activin A. The NK cells were temporarily exposed to the CRISPR/cas9 system, programmed with a guide so that they could head specifically towards the SMAD4, edit it and disappear.


By eliminating the SMAD4 we make these cells resistant to the TGF-β's inhibition but we continue to make use of the rest of the molecule's signaling to have them acquire a greater capacity to reach tumors and penetrate them.


The study now published allows demonstrating the safety and efficiency of this approach. In collaboration with other institutions, it was also possible to verify that using it with other treatments under development that are based on the NK cells enables boosting its effect.


These genetically modified NK cells offer a great treatment opportunity for patients with solid tumors that are currently resistant to immunotherapy.

Dr. Muntasell and Dr. Montagut are precisely the two researchers leading a project that has received one of the independent research grants from the Instituto de Salud Carlos III.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A depression prevention program called LARS&LISA has helped white youth but was not effective for Black youth.

The program was developed about 25 years ago in Germany and later implemented in Tennessee, and it includes vignettes with two characters named Lars and Lisa.

The current study included 425 freshman students in a Louisville, Kentucky, high school serving primarily low-income students.

Half of the students were in a control group while the other half participated in the 10-week LARS&LISA program.

The program uses group sessions designed to build motivation through personal goal setting followed by aspects of cognitive behavioral therapy.

Students are encouraged to recognize unhelpful thoughts and replace them with more helpful thoughts, and they learn about the pros and cons of different behaviors.

They also practice skills needed to form new social networks.

White youth who participated in the program reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms after completing the program and at a follow-up period four months later.

However, Black youth in the program didn't differ from the control group, with no significant benefits found after completing the program or at the follow-up period.

The study couldn't determine why the program was unsuccessful for Black youth so more research is needed.

Psychological theories and treatment programs are largely developed based on white, middle-class, female American clients or college students in psychology courses.

We need to take a step back and examine the consequences of these limitations, said lead researcher Patrick Pössel.

The study found that another depression prevention program called Penn Resiliency Program was effective for white and Latino youth but showed no significant effects on depressive symptoms for Black youth.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Excess weight in mid-life is a known risk factor for kidney cancer, but new research indicates that weight patterns throughout life may also affect an individual's likelihood of developing this malignancy.

The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study analyzed information on 204,364 individuals, including body mass index (BMI) data when participants entered the study at an average age of 61.6 years, and prior BMI recordings at 18, 35, and 50 years of age.

The team noted that there were 1,425 cases of kidney cancer, or renal cell carcinoma (RCC), among the study's participants, with 583 having aggressive RCC and 339 having fatal RCC. The researchers also recorded the different subtypes of RCC, including clear cell RCC (541 patients), papillary RCC (146 patients), and chromophobe RCC (64 patients).

Higher BMI at any of the ages assessed was linked with higher risks of overall RCC and all subtypes (except chromophobe RCC), with a 10-40% higher risk for each 5-unit increase in BMI.

Similar increased risks were linked to weight gain during adulthood that resulted in overweight or obesity, compared with maintaining normal BMI.

Long-term excess weight was associated with higher risks of overall RCC, aggressive RCC, fatal RCC, and clear cell RCC, but not papillary RCC and chromophobe RCC.

Weight loss in which BMI was reduced by at least 10%, particularly later in life, was associated with a lower risk of RCC. Specifically, weight loss from age 18–35 years and after age 50 years was associated with 21% and 28% reductions in RCC incidence, respectively.

These findings emphasize that maintaining a healthy weight across one's lifetime is important for reducing RCC risk.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250324/Citrus-remedy-squeezes-out-dry-mouth-for-cancer-patients.aspx'>Citrus remedy squeezes out dry mouth for cancer patients</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-24 00:00:00 <p>
A natural citrus oil from oranges, lemons, and limes is proving highly effective in relieving dry mouth.

Developed by the University of South Australia in collaboration with the Medical School at Stanford University, this world first formulation uniquely combines limonene (a citrus essential oil) with a lipid-based drug delivery system to treat dry mouth (xerostomia), a common side effect of radiotherapy.


The new formula demonstrated 180-fold better solubility than pure limonene in lab experiments and boosted relative bioavailability by over 4000% compared to pure limonene in pre-clinical trials.

Dry mouth is the most reported side effect following radiotherapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer, affecting up to 70% of patients due to salivary gland damage. It can lead to difficulty speaking and swallowing, significantly reducing quality of life.


Limonene has protective effects on saliva production during radiotherapy, but its poor solubility means high doses are needed to take effect, and these cause indigestion, abdominal discomfort and unpleasant ‘citrus burps’.


The University of South Australia’s new limonene-lipid combination creates a ‘super-solubilizing’ treatment that reduces dry mouth at lower dose and without uncomfortable side effects.

Lead researcher, Professor Clive Prestidge says the formulation has therapeutic benefits beyond just treating dry mouth.

"Our novel formulation combines limonene with healthy fats and oils – called lipids – to create a super-solubilizing compound that the body can easily absorb with reduced uncomfortable side effects," he says.


Co-researcher Dr Leah Wright says the formulation has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for cancer patients and others suffering dry mouth conditions.

Cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy regularly experience dry mouth, which not only prevents them from comfortably swallowing, but can also have other negative outcomes.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
