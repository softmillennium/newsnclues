Non-executive directors told Peel Hunt they were expecting a wave of UK takeovers.

Non-executive directors of UK companies and bracing for a wave of takeover bids throughout 2025 as British firms face continual share price weakness.

As many as 80 per cent of non-executive directors said that their companies are more vulnerable to a takeover bid, according to data from investment bank Peel Hunt.

Last year, a host of significant UK companies were taken over, including the £5.7bn merger of UK cardboard box giant DS Smith and US rival International Paper and investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown’s £5.4bn sale to a group of private equity buyers.

Other multibillion-pound deals included a US private equity firm’s £4.3bn takeover of cybersecurity company Darktrace, Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky’s £3.6bn swoop for Royal Mail owner IDS, and Nationwide’s £2.8bn purchase of Virgin Money.

Indeed, 92 per cent of non-executive directors told Peel Hunt that they were expecting an increase in takeovers of UK companies more widely this year.

A majority of those surveyed attributed an expected rise in takeovers to share price weakness and UK public market undervaluation, with two thirds strongly agreeing that the factors were affecting the companies they represent.

However, only 15 per cent said they were sure that they could confidently assess shareholder appetite for an offer if their firm faced a takeover bid.

“Notwithstanding ongoing efforts to identify solutions – the current challenges facing UK equity markets are having an enduring impact on UK plc share prices and, consequently, the vulnerability of those companies to unsolicited, and potentially unwelcome, bids,” said Michael Nicholson, head of advisory and M&A at Peel Hunt.

“Today more than ever, it is essential that boards are ready to enter bid situations with both a firm grasp of the intrinsic value of the company; and a clear view of shareholders’ appetite for a bid at various prices.

“Assessing an offer proposal without one or the other risks leaving companies exposed to bidders seeking to acquire UK plcs on the cheap.”

Despite the overall trend of a rise in takeovers, the number of foreign investors launching M&A deals for UK companies actually plummeted in the fourth quarter of last year.

The number of foreign companies buying UK firms fell to its lowest level since the pandemic during the quarter, dropping from £10.4bn to £4.5bn.",cityam

ormer Bangladesh cricket captain Tamim Iqbal suffered a heart attack during a domestic T20 game

Former Bangladesh cricket captain Tamim Iqbal is receiving emergency hospital care after suffering a heart attack during a domestic T20 game in Dhaka.

The 36-year-old opener, his country’s record ODI run-scorer, was captaining Mohammedan Sporting club in their Dhaka Premier League fixture against Shinepukur when he complained of chest pains after taking the field.

Plans to transport him in a helicopter were abandoned as his condition deteriorated and he was instead taken for immediate treatment at a closer facility.

“Tamim Iqbal Khan suffered a cardiac arrest this morning at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan,” said the Bangladesh Cricket Board.

“Tamim received immediate emergency medical treatment after being transferred to the nearby KPJ Specialized Hospital, where he underwent a successful angiogram procedure to address a blockage in one of the arteries of his heart.

“He is currently under close observation at the hospital’s coronary care unit.”

Tamim, the only Bangladesh player to score centuries in all three formats, also had spells in England with Nottinghamshire and Essex.

He retired from international cricket last year, a few months after captaining the side in three ODIs against England.

BCB president Faruque Ahmed, who has reportedly visited the batter in hospital after cancelling a board meeting, said: “We are very thankful to all the medics and specialists for their swift actions in this critical situation.

“The outpouring of concern for Tamim reflects how much he is loved and appreciated by the nation.

“The BCB is closely monitoring his health and continues to remain in contact with the hospital’s medical team. The board is committed to providing every support and assistance to ensure Tamim’s swift recovery.”

https://cityam.com,Adolescence fans are watching Stephen Graham's Boiling Point,https://www.cityam.com/boiling-point-a-one-shot-restaurant-drama-that-makes-you-stand-the-heat/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 14:45:41 GMT","Adolescence fans are discovering ‘unbearably tense’ Stephen Graham drama Boiling Point

Adolescence, following one teenage boy’s relationship with women and incel culture, has taken the internet by storm, with millions of people tuning in to watch Stephen Graham’s incredible performance as the dad of a young boy accused of murder.

But fans are pointing out that Adolescence isn’t the first time Stephen Graham has worked in this format, shooting an entire episode in one shot without cutting. Another show, called Boiling Point, came out a couple of years ago and was shot in the exact same formula — also starring Graham.

One fan wrote on social media: “Now that everyone’s talking about Adolescence on Netflix I’d like to take a moment to recommend Stephen Graham and Philip Barantini’s previous project, Boiling Point (2021). An unbearably tense one-shot drama thriller set in the kitchen of a prestigious restaurant. Don’t miss it!”

While another wrote: “Stephen Graham has done the one shot thing before adolescence too – in this brilliant film called Boiling Point. watch.”

Another added: “Found out the director of boiling point is the one behind that new netflix series adolescence consider it shot up to the top of my watchlist.”

The ‘one-shot’ movie has become more prevalent over the years, as digital film has made the process less technically fraught. While the most famous examples have some trickery (Birdman and Hitchcock’s Rope had hidden edits), many filmmakers have taken on the arduous task of filming an entire movie in one take.

The latest is British filmmaker Philip Barantini with Boiling Point, a drama where the camera follows the action continuously for 93 agonising minutes.

Read more UK insolvency rules are trapping firms between Scylla and Charybdis

Stephen Graham stars as Andy, a well-respected but confrontational head chef at a London restaurant. After a tough personal conversation, he walks into the kitchen for what will be the most difficult night of his career. He’s just been downgraded by the health inspector, almost every dish is running low, his right-hand woman Carly (Vinette Robinson) is on the brink of quitting… and the doors haven’t even opened yet. As the evening goes on, Andy tries to juggle the mounting pressures that threaten to ruin him.

The smarmy, patronising tones of the health inspector are enough to make your skin crawl, but it turns out to be the tip of an anxiety iceberg. Everywhere the camera goes, there seems to be a new issue exploding or a new character to dislike – a racist patron, a demanding food blogger, not to mention Andy’s former boss, celebrity chef Alastair Skye (Jason Flemyng) making a surprise appearance. Anyone who doubted the stress of the service industry is thrown headfirst into a warzone, where the well-intentioned clash with the entitled, and everyone seems to be pulling in different directions.

This is not to say Barantini creates an us vs them atmosphere. Everyone in Boiling Point has a story, and a breaking point, glimpsed in beautifully captured moments such as an embattled manager calling her father from the loo, or a pastry chef fighting back the tears after discovering something about a colleague. It’s perfect chaos, a story that shows the struggle of just getting through a shift. The camera work is deceptively simple, moving elegantly back and forth from dining room to kitchen, while also managing the shifts in tone.

More impressive than the technical prowess are the performances found in every corner. Outside of the lead, Robinson’s Carly is magnificent, revealing a person teetering on the edge of resignation as she chooses between her loyalty to Andy and a new opportunity. Flemyng is the perfect fly in the ointment, poking at Andy’s insecurities while nursing a secret of his own.

Exchanges come thick and fast, but everyone makes it count – none more so than Graham. It would be easy to do a Gordon Ramsey impression, but Andy is something different. Coming into the story as a ball of rage, calling everyone ‘love’ or ‘soft lad’, the bravado crumbles as he realises the mess he’s in. Like a boxer who knows the next punch might flatten him, Graham swerves and bargains his way through each problem, confusion and fear building behind his eyes. It’s remarkable to watch, if a bit stressful.

The trouble with constantly building the stakes is that you risk going too far. The third act contains a crescendo of misfortune that’s – ahem – hard to swallow, but by this point you’ll be too invested to pick holes. For the most part, Boiling Point finds an exceptional story in an ordinary setting, and special performances in every frame.",cityam

Former City traders convicted as part of the rate-rigging scandal are playing their last remaining card this week by taking their case to the Supreme Court.

The scandal arose in 2012 when banks were discovered to be falsely inflating or deflating their rates.

In August 2015, former UBS and Citigroup trader Tom Hayes was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud by ‘rigging’ the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR).

Former Barclays trader Carlo Palombo was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud by rigging the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) in March 2019.

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) investigated and prosecuted both men and others in the EURIBOR case.

After 54 years, the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) confirmed last October that all 35 LIBOR settings have permanently ceased.

Hayes was sentenced to 11 years in years in prison, and was released after five and a half years, while Palombo served four years.

The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) referred the case to the Court of Appeal, concluding there was a “real possibility” the Court would conclude their convictions were unsafe.

This decision came after a ruling by the US Appeal Court regarding the definition and proper operation of LIBOR and EURIBOR.

However, the Court of Appeal upheld Hayes and Palombo’s convictions last March.

Read more Regulator considers redress scheme in motor finance review

Speaking outside the Court last year, Hayes told the press that the “UK remains an international outlier in relation to the definition operation of Libor, not only with America but also with Europe.”

The Court of Appeal rejected the men’s application to appeal to the Supreme Court, so they had to go to the Court directly.

Their last sting at trying to overturn their convictions is set for the Supreme Court tomorrow.

There will be two issues for the court to consider; is a LIBOR or EURIBOR submission automatically dishonest if it is influenced by a trading advantage.

And must a LIBOR or EURIBOR submission be of the single cheapest rate at which the panel or prime bank could borrow at the time of the submissions or can it be a rate selected from within a range of potential borrowing rates.

Emma Shafton, senior associate at Reed Smith (she was seconded to the SFO between 2015-2016), stated: “It’s difficult to see how the conviction could be overturned on the basis that the UK is an outlier in its approach to LIBOR.”

“That argument alone is unlikely to move the Court. To put it simply, the findings of another jurisdiction’s courts are very rarely decisive. Just because something is common practice overseas does not have a bearing on its legality under English law,” she explained.

Maia Cohen-Lask, partner at Corker Binning, added: “It is unclear whether the Supreme Court will tackle [the US interpretations] head-on, the Court of Appeal having side-stepped the issue by suggesting that the two jurisdictions were in fact considering different questions.”

“However, it is consideration of the cross-jurisdictional impact question, not the LIBOR definition question, which has the potential to have ramifications for future prosecutions,” she added.

The hearing starts on Tuesday and runs until Thursday. A highly anticipated judgment will follow at a later date.",cityam

Family owned businesses and farms across the UK are cutting jobs, halting investment and selling assets to stay afloat in response to sweeping tax changes.

According to research by CBI-Economics, commissioned by Family Business UK, the government’s move to cap business property relief (BPR) and reform agricultural property relief (APR) has triggered a wave of uncertainty.

The research found that the tax overhaul is expected to result in more than 208,000 job losses by the end of this Parliament.

It has also projected a net fiscal loss to the Treasury of £1.9bn, undermining its own revenue expectations.

Unveiled as part of the government’s broader effort to raise revenue, the tax changes place new restrictions on inheritance tax relief for agricultural land and property, and family-run businesses.

Under this move, BPR, which is a tax relief allowing family businesses to pass assets down generations without restrictive tax burdens, will now be capped at £1m.

Meanwhile, the new rules have placed APR, which has long supported generational continuity within the farming sector, under reforms.

These will further limit tax exemptions on agricultural assets.

Businesses have already taken drastic measures to mitigate the impact.

The study found that nearly a quarter of businesses (23 per cent) and 17 per cent of family farms, have already slashed their headcount since the Budget.

What’s more, over half of family-owned organisations and almost half of family farms have either paused or cancelled planned investments, citing financial uncertainty.

As the April 2026 deadline for tax changes nears, further cutbacks have also been anticipated.

The implications extend beyond UK businesses, impacting local economies and critical supply chains.

Over one in ten (12 per cent) of family businesses have planned to sell up their entire organisations to cover the future burden, with 9 per cent having already done so.

Neil Davy, chief executive of Family Business UK, warned that the government’s approach risks stifling key industries.

He said: “At a time of economic fragility, these tax changes are forcing family-run businesses – the backbone of the UK economy – into difficult decisions that will hurt investment, jobs, and growth.”

“The evidence is clear: these policies are already damaging confidence, pushing businesses to sell up, cut back, or shut down entirely.”

While the government has expected these reforms to boost public finances, the study casts doubt on its economic projections.

The office for budget responsibility (OBR) has assigned a “high” uncertainty rating to the policy, unsure how family farms and businesses would react.

Yet, the latest data provides an answer: businesses are retreating.

What’s more, the overall tax take could ultimately decline because of job losses and reduced economic activity.

Davy urged for a reassessment of the policy: “There is still time for the government to engage with businesses and find a workable solution that protects jobs and investment while achieving its revenue goals.”

With tax changes set to take full effect in 2026, pressure is mounting on ministers to reconsider their approach.

The coming months will reveal whether the government is willing to adjust course and find a more sustainable solution in response to these growing concerns.",cityam

The Spring Statement this week will not “alter the basics” of public spending plans, Sir Keir Starmer has insisted.

The Spring Statement this week will not “alter the basics” of public spending plans, Sir Keir Starmer has insisted, amid reports the government is considering tax cuts for tech firms.

Speaking this morning, the Prime Minister said he wanted to “take some money out of government” and that his ministers were “looking across the board” at spending.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves will deliver the Spring Statement to the Commons on Wednesday, when she is expected to announce spending cuts for some government departments, amid already announced reductions to the welfare bill and civil service running costs.

It comes as a new YouGov survey found 80 per cent of Brits believe the public finances are in a poor state, including 34 per cent who say they are in a “very bad” state – with just three per cent believing the government is in a good place financially.

Asked by BBC Radio 5 Live about cuts to unprotected departments, such as the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), the Prime Minister said his government was “looking across the board” at spending.

He insisted: “At the budget last year we made some record investments, and we’re not going to undo that.

“We’re not going to alter the basics, but we are going to look across and one of the areas that we will be looking at is, can we run the government more efficiently?

“Can we take some money out of government? And I think we can. I think we’re essentially asking businesses across the country to be more efficient, to look at AI and tech in the way that they do their business.

“I want the same challenge in government, which is, why shouldn’t we be more efficient?”

Starmer’s civil service reforms

The Prime Minister initially set out plans to prune the size of the civil service when he set out his public sector reform proposals in early March ahead of the Spring Statement.

Read more Chancellor lining up billions in spending cuts as fiscal headroom wiped out

Artificial intelligence (AI) and technology “could do a huge amount now that is done manually”, the Prime Minister also told the BBC.

He added: “Some of the examples I’ve been given are in the NHS – a stethoscope and AI, working together can predict pretty accurately if you’re 60 years or over, whether you’re going to have a heart problem and therefore get in early, saves a fortune for the NHS.”

He said AI could be used for organising waiting lists and identifying people likely to miss appointments, calling it “transformative” and saying it would “make a huge difference”.

But civil service unions have warned 50,000 people could lose their jobs and vital services could deteriorate after Reeves confirmed plans to cut costs by 15 per cent by 2030.

While the Times newspaper reported cuts to the education budget could come from ending free school meals for younger children, and the Chancellor pledged to The Sun newspaper that she would not be raising taxes in the Spring Statement.

Digital services tax

Reeves also told broadcasters on Monday: “Digital services tax is hugely important, it brings in around £800m a year and ensures companies pay tax in the country they are operating in.

“So we will continue to make sure that businesses pay their fair share of tax, including businesses in the digital sector.”

An impact assessment for the government’s welfare cuts will also be published on Wednesday.

Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride has warned ahead of the fiscal event that Reeves “needs to take responsibility for her own choices”, adding: “Economic stagnation and higher government borrowing cannot be blamed on external factors – it was clear we were on this path ever since her first disastrous Budget.”

He added: “Labour promised stability and said there would only be one fiscal event a year. Yet another promise they are about to break. The Chancellor is rapidly losing credibility.”",cityam

The founder of Charles Tyrwhitt, Nick Wheeler, has told City AM that there’s “no point whinging about what the government are doing or not doing, because they’re not going to change,” adding “I’ve got to get on and make my own decisions.”

His comments came during an interview with City AM in which he lamented the lack of business experience among politicians. The storied shirt maker said “politicians very rarely come from a business background…I think it’s well publicised that this cabinet or this government have not had business experience.”

In a wide-ranging conversation, Wheeler, who founded Charles Tyrwhitt as a student in Bristol in the 1980s, also revealed the business is “wargaming scenarios” as President Trump’s tariff policy risks causing significant disruption to the retailer’s fast-growing US operations.

Wheeler said that if the Trump administration imposes “full duty at retail price on products going to the US, that’s going to be very, very expensive for us.” The business is considering constructing a warehouse in the US and “shipping in at wholesale.”

From Covid and tariffs to a changing City style

Elsewhere in the interview, Wheeler discusses:

Why he’s always resisted taking external investment – “It’s not a given that you need to go out and find that.”

Early business mistakes – “I lost more money in three months than I made in the last three years and went bust…so that was a bit of a shock to the system.”

His three simple rules – “There are some very simple business rules that I think that every business should stick to, and actually a surprising number of businesses don’t stick to and I think that’s why a lot of businesses get into trouble along the way.”

How the disaster of the pandemic became an opportunity – “Covid was initially the worst time of my life and latterly probably one of the best things that ever happened to me, because it woke me up as to what was going on in the business. It was a damn good kick up the arse that we needed.”

Wheeler also talks about the current strength of the business and the changing styles and fashions in formalwear and workwear in the City, and gives his advice to aspiring entrepreneurs: “I think for the right person, it’s the best thing in the world.”",cityam

Firms across London think the government will fall flat on its ambition to grow the UK economy, a new survey has shown.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set out to woo businesses in the City of London over the last few years.

But around nine in ten businesses across the capital doubt the government can achieve growth, according to research by the London Chamber of Commerce.

Some 70 per cent of firms said they did not even believe their own businesses would grow compared to last year.

The majority of 150 businesses surveyed also blamed Labour government policies stifling output.

The three main concerns cited were autumn Budget measures, lower-than-expected growth and the Employment Rights Bill – a “triple shock” that could send the economy into further decline.

The survey of 150 businesses in the capital is likely to be a final warning to the Chancellor as she prepares to deliver her Spring Statement on Wednesday.

Reeves is likely to make sweeping cuts to government spending in her bid to balance the books.

A reform to pensions may be one of the cards to be pulled out, with her speech at Mansion House last year suggesting she wished to overhaul the system to allow greater investment.

Companies said they were in dire need of some relief from the Chancellor as just five per cent of businesses said raising taxes would help growth.

Three quarters said the rise to capital gains taxes would have a negative impact on their income.

London Chamber of Commerce chief executive Karim Fatehi said the survey painted a “stark picture”.

“Businesses do not have confidence that the government can deliver economic growth if it continues along a road of tax hikes and employment regulation.”

“They should listen to businesses and urgently change course,” he added.",cityam

Morrisons has announced that 365 jobs have been put at risk of being lost.

Supermarket giant Morrisons has put 365 jobs at risk after it revealed plans to close more than 50 of its cafes.

The Yorkshire-headquartered chain said 52 of its cafes, 17 convenience stores and dozens of meat and fish counters at its shops are slated for closure.

Morrisons said the closures are part of a “wide-ranging” review of the business.

As well as the cafes and convenience stores, 13 florists, 35 meat counters, 35 fish counters and four pharmacies and all 18 Market Kitchens are to be closed.

At the end of January, City AM reported that the Yorkshire-headquartered chain has achieved a revenue of £15.2bn for the 12 months to 27 October, 2024, up from £14.7bn.

Its group like-for-like sales also increased from 1.8 per cent to 4.1 per cent.

Morrisons: ‘Changes are necessary’

Morrisons chief executive Rami Baitiéh said: “The changes we are announcing today are a necessary part of our plans to renew and reinvigorate Morrisons and enable us to focus our investment into the areas that customers really value and that can play a full part in our growth.

“Morrisons Cafés are rightly famous for their great quality well-priced food, their place in the local community and their appealing mix of traditional favourites alongside exciting new dishes.

“In most locations the Morrisons Café has a bright future, but a minority have specific local challenges and in those locations, regrettably, closure and re-allocation of the space is the only sensible option.

“Market Street is a beacon of differentiation for Morrisons and we remain committed to it.

“But as we modernise we are making some necessary changes to the areas of the model which are simply uneconomic. In some stores where we are closing counters or Cafés, we plan to work with third parties to provide a relevant specialist offer.”

“Although these changes are relatively small in the context of the overall scale of the Morrisons business, we do not take lightly the disruption and uncertainty they will cause to some of our colleagues.

“We will of course take particular care to look after all of them well through the coming changes.”

Cafes cull follows Sainsbury’s lead

The move comes after City AM reported in January that Sainsbury’s was planning to axe more than 3,000 roles as it prepares to close all its remaining in-store cafes.

The major overhaul will cut two per cent of its current workforce, which stands at 148,000.

The move will also make around 20 per cent of senior management roles at Sainsbury’s redundant.

The drive is part of the supermarket giant’s plans to focus on fewer, bigger roles and to simplify its head office and management teams.

The retailer also said it had decided to close its remaining 61 Sainsbury’s Cafes, subject to consultation.

Supermarket giant ‘on the defensive’

Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Morrisons is on the defensive, as trolley wars threaten to break out in the supermarket sector.

“The supermarket chain is closing services seen as nice-to-have, but not essential, and scaling back its convenience footprint as it readies for a round of cost-cutting from rivals.

“It comes after Asda’s new chair Allan Leighton boasted that he had a ‘war chest’ to spend on turning around the struggling grocer.

“At the same time, discounters Aldi and Lidl are already proving to be formidable competition.

“Morrison’s clearly wants to free up cash to be as value-focused as possible as an intense period of competition is forecast.

“It follows a similar move by Sainsbury’s earlier this year, as the grocer refocused on improving its core offerings and closed cafes and more counters to streamline the business.

“Shares in Sainsbury’s as well as listed rivals Tesco and Marks and Spencer are lower on the news.

“They had already lost significant ground, amid expectations that a price war in the aisles may affect profits, especially as it coincides with upcoming payroll increases. For shoppers though, it’ll be welcome relief.

“They had been bracing for further rises to be passed on by the grocers later this year due to their higher tax burdens, so a price war may lighten the load for struggling families, particularly those lower income households, where the weekly shop makes up a significantly greater proportion of their incomes.’’",cityam

AI copyright laws

Tech secretary Peter Kyle has promised that the government will not be forced to choose between the UK’s creative industry and its burgeoning AI sector, as it prepares for the integration of new AI copyright regulations.

“We have the third largest AI market in the world, and the second largest creative arts sector”, Kyle told the Financial Times on Monday. “I will not pit one against the other”.

This follows fierce opposition from the UK’s leading creatives, with filmmakers, musicians, authors and media groups all fighting against proposals that could give AI firms the right to train on their copyrighted material, unless they actively opt out.

Speaking at Nvidia’s GTC conference in Silicon Valley last week, Kyle stressed that the nation must “prioritise…forward movement”, while making sure that fair protection is put in place for creatives and rights holders.

The UK’s consultation on AI policy – which could allow tech firms to train models on copyrighted material – has triggered widespread backlash from the creative, entertainment, and media industries.

Critics urged that the proposed method of ‘opting out’ places an unfair advantage on tech firms, whilst placing creatives in a vulnerable position wherein their content can be scraped without compensation, unless they actively prevent it.

In response, newspapers across the UK, including The Guardian and The Sun, launched a ‘make it fair’ campaign.

Together, organisations warned that AI companies may exploit their content without remuneration, threatening the sustainability of the news industry.

Owen Meredith, chief executive of the News Media Association, said: “Copyright is fundamental to publishers’ ability to invest in trusted journalism. AI should be no different”.

The music industry also raised alarms following the news, with artists worrying that AI-generated songs could be built from components of their work, without consent or pay.

This move reflects a similar dialogue across the pond, where American record labels and publishers have filed numerous lawsuits against AI firms accused of infringing copyright laws.

Kyle addressed the issues in regulating AI, while ensuring the UK’s position as a leader in both tech and creative arts.

He confirmed that his department will be reviewing the 11,000 responses to its consultation before finalising its approach to the issue.

“We will find a way through it and get both sectors facing the future”, he argued, “fit for the digital age, with rights, protections, and ability to earn money in the digital economy.”",cityam

JD Sports is majority-owned by Pentland Group

London broker Peel Hunt has downgraded its forecast for JD Sports ahead of the company’s full-year results next month due to short-term industry issues.

Peel Hunt cut its projected profit before tax and earnings per share for JD Sports by three per cent for the financial year 2026.

The broker attributed the downgrade to an overhang of Nike stock, which “is likely to persist deep into JD’s [next financial year].”

JD’s American revenue is particularly reliant on Nike footwear, but demand for the latter has faltered over the past year.

Last week, shares in Nike slumped to a five-year low after it reported a steeper-than-expected drop in fourth-quarter revenue – its fourth straight quarter of declining sales.

Nike has struggled with a post-pandemic shift away from athleisure, as well as competition from upstart trainer brands Hoka and On.

The result is a huge excess of ‘Classic’ footwear franchises: Air Force 1, Air Jordan 1, and Dunk.

“Simply put, there is an awful lot of stock left to shift, and consequently, the whole industry margin structure is impacted,” Peel Hunt analysts said.

“JD will not participate in heavy discounting, so while its gross margin should be robust, it is likely its Nike sales will suffer,” analysts added.

JD Sports’ share price has been on a steady downward slope since last September. Its value has fallen 52 per cent since the middle of September.

Peel Hunt also noted that sales of other goods are unlikely to offset the downturn in Nike product sales due to low consumer confidence and spending.

This has caused a general pullback from retail stocks, with many big names taking a beating this year.

High street sales growth has been particularly poor post-pandemic and has yet to pick up, something especially tough for JD as stores tend to outperform its online channel.

Earlier this year, the Pentland-owned company warned profit would be lower than expected due to a “challenging and volatile market”.

Still, despite the near-term challenges, the broker said JD Sports remained one of the top players in the footwear market.

“In our view, JD will come out of these difficult industry times in a stronger position. It remains the big brands’ partner of choice and continues to innovate both in-store and online.

“While these big industry issues cannot help but weigh on short-term forecast momentum, we believe the long-term outlook is rosy,” analysts said.",cityam

The Prime Minister is right to focus on regulating for growth, not just to prevent risk, but this must be complemented by a change in mindset for British businesses, says Alastair King

It was heartening to read the Prime Minister’s recent column in City AM on the government’s commitment to cut the cost of regulation for businesses and “bring back the animal spirits of the private sector”. This builds on the commitments made by the Chancellor in her Mansion House speech to reform a regulatory culture which has become too risk-averse, to the point of sometimes stifling innovation and growth.

The government’s recognition of excessive risk aversion in the system is absolutely correct. We need to regulate for growth, not just against risk. By addressing this, we can unlock our potential and drive substantial investment.

Regulatory reform on the part of the government is central to the theme of this mayoralty – growth unleashed – so that we move on from averting failure to encouraging success, and embrace positive risk as an essential ingredient for growth. The City of London Corporation is actively working with senior practitioners to develop innovative ideas aimed at improving risk culture and regulation to support growth. We look forward to sharing these bold proposals later this summer.

The economy shrank 0.1 per cent in January after 0.4 per cent growth in December but the overall picture for the UK is weak growth, according to the ONS. The OECD recently revised its growth forecast for the UK trimming its GDP growth estimate for 2025 to 1.4 per cent, a 0.3 percentage point reduction from its previous calculation. The government is on a mission to drive economic growth both in the short and long term and it must act decisively. There is no silver bullet to achieve this but reforming regulation in the financial services sector is among the best weapons in the government’s armoury.

Seizing opportunity

This regulatory reform must be complemented by mindset reform on the part of British businesses, who need to invest in new technologies, seize the opportunities on offer and find new ones overseas.

We are pleased to see the government making good on its commitments with the regulation action plan announced last week – including several measures recommended by the City of London Corporation, which we will now help to deliver.

Top of the list, the City of London Corporation is proud to partner with HM Treasury, the regulators and the Office for Investment to establish a concierge service for international firms, enhancing the attractiveness of the UK as a destination for global financial services. This initiative will make it easier for firms to navigate regulation and overcome barriers to entry. Foreign direct investment has been a key driver of economic growth not only in London but across the country. Research by the City of London Corporation found that in 2023 the UK attracted 222 financial and professional services projects involving 177 foreign companies valued at £1.1bn. Manchester and Birmingham emerged as notable recipients and collectively centres outside the capital accounted for around 40 per cent of total investment by projects.

We also welcome the FCA’s efforts to provide more support for high-growth firms and reduce regulatory reporting. The City Corporation has been supporting the development of Regtech which will play a crucial role in reducing compliance costs, further aiding these firms.

In a time of geopolitical uncertainty and with the UK seen as a relative haven of stability, we have an opportunity to unleash a new wave of investment

We support the Pensions Regulator’s push to encourage investment in productive assets through the voluntary disclosure of asset allocation data. This is an important tool to help deliver and build on the Mansion House Compact, first agreed by my predecessor Sir Nicholas Lyons, to unlock greater investment from British pension funds into British firms, infrastructure and resilience.

In a time of geopolitical uncertainty and with the UK seen as a relative haven of stability, we have an opportunity to unleash a new wave of investment. Taken together, these initiatives can ensure that Britain remains at the forefront of global financial services, fostering an environment where innovation and growth can thrive. Now is the time to hammer home our positive message to the world: whatever business you want to do, do it in London.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)

The EU’s ‘buy European’ defence spending plan is protectionist and short-sighted. And it really just means ‘buy French’, writes Eliot Wilson

The message from President Trump that Europe can no longer rely on American military power and must look to its own resources seems finally to be filtering through to the continent’s chancelleries. The European Commission has proposed a €150bn loan mechanism, Security Action for Europe (SAFE); this would be raised on the capital markets and would fund member states’ investment in urgently needed capabilities like drones and missile defence.

It is a substantial sum of money, though Germany is now contemplating an additional €500bn just for its own defence budget after the Bundestag agreed to modify the country’s constitutional “debt brake”. But this is Brussels: not only is the “free lunch” illusory but every bite can have a ripple of consequences.

What is the new EU defence spending plan?

SAFE as currently proposed would only be available to be spent with manufacturers which are wholly within the EU, Norway or Ukraine (65 per cent) and countries which have signed security agreements with the EU (35 per cent).

That stipulation would exclude not only American companies but also those in the UK and Turkey, as well as any weapons systems over which a third-party country had “design authority” or control over their use. That means it could not be spent, for example, on Patriot air and missile defence systems (made by RTX, formerly Raytheon) or any of BAE Systems’ uncrewed air systems.

In fact, 39 of the world’s top 50 defence manufacturers are excluded, but – by purest coincidence, no doubt – the rules place no limitations on products from four French companies (Thales, Naval Group, Safran and Dassault) or on Amsterdam-based KNDS, which is fifty per cent owned by France’s state holding agency, l’Agence des participations de l’État, which also happens to control shares in Thales, Naval Group and Safran.

Anyone surprised that the EU is using this loan mechanism as a protectionist and political device is naive. Brussels has come a long way from the Treaty of Rome which in 1957 sought “​​the progressive abolition of restrictions on international trade”. It now believes in frictionless trade within the EU’s ramparts but a Common Customs Tariff protecting Fortress Europe from without.

Read more FTSE 100 giants Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems surge following Ukraine defence summit

How SAFE will impact the UK

Advocates of these restrictions on SAFE argue that they are necessary to build up the European defence industry. Up to a point, Lord Copper. There are two additional aspects to consider.

The first is the provision allowing spending with companies in countries which have signed a security pact with the EU. This is transparently aimed at the UK: the Labour Party’s election manifesto last summer pledged to “seek an ambitious new UK-EU security pact”, and it is a major preoccupation of Sir Keir Starmer’s. However, as I wrote in this paper last June, Starmer and his colleagues hugely overestimate how much the UK matters to the EU.

Europe’s leaders see a security pact not just as an end in itself, but as a bargaining chip in a wider “reset” of the relationship between the UK and the EU which will also encompass access to fisheries and migration, among other issues. The conditions attached to SAFE would allow the EU to use the potential market for UK firms like BAE Systems, Babcock International and Rolls Royce as leverage on the British government.

How France stands to gain

This kind of industrial nationalism fits poorly with trends in defence manufacturing, however, which lean increasingly towards multinational co-operation to spread costs and risk. SAFE could not, for example, be used for the Global Combat Air Programme, the UK/Italy/Japan development of a sixth-generation stealth aircraft or the NASAMS air defence system, an American-Norwegian product made by RTX and Kongsberg.

A great deal of defence procurement across the continent involves non-EU players: the Mowag Piranha armoured fighting vehicle used by Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Romania, Spain and Sweden is made by a subsidiary of General Dynamics, while the tracked CV90 in service with Denmark, Estonia, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden is supplied by BAE’s Swedish subsidiary.

There is one leading player which relies predominantly on domestic or EU equipment: France. One senior figure in the UK defence industry mournfully told the Financial Times: “If the EU… is going to be transactional about this, it undermines the entire philosophy of a joint and unified Europe in defence and security terms.”

It does. The UK’s 47-year membership of the European family should have taught us that “buy European” often means “buy French”. That is disappointing but not surprising, But the EU is acting short-sightedly: the “unfair advantage” granted to EU manufacturers will not benefit them in the long run. In the meantime the EU’s military faces an artificially restricted menu when it needs the best capabilities it can find. So much for l’Entente Cordiale.",cityam
https://cityam.com,What NOT to expect in the Spring Statement,https://www.cityam.com/what-not-to-expect-in-the-spring-statement/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 05:42:00 GMT","What NOT to expect in the Spring Statement

(Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)

The Spring Statement shouldn’t be a big thing, but it’s increasingly feeling like it could be. Laurence Field and Robert Marchant write what the Chancellor should do, but won’t

Predictions on government fiscal policy are notoriously difficult, but 2025 feels like a year where that challenge is even more acute. Political and economic uncertainty has continued, there is an ever-increasing threat of global trade wars emanating from US tariffs and the UK’s economy has stubbornly refused to grow.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves tried to cut a confident figure last October. Her Budget message? We are sticking to a path of plugging (alleged) black holes through an increase in taxes, but it’s currently just this one NIC rise, and we are unrelenting in our focus on growth.

So now we have a Spring Statement. It’s probably not going to be a Budget, although there have been whispers it may include some fiscal changes. It should be an update on how things are going since we last heard from the Treasury – we all know that there is a lot of uncertainty, and that uncertainty is the enemy of investment, and, therefore, growth.

What are the uncertainties facing the Chancellor? As Neils Bohr, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist highlighted, forecasting is hard, especially when it’s about the future. The ONS forecasts appear to have been overly optimistic at best. Many independent forecasters have come up with lower numbers for growth, and lower-than-expected tax receipts suggest the headroom is gone.

Growth and productivity gains are illusive; lower paid workers are bearing the brunt of the NIC rises with job losses and reduced wage increases. Ordinary working people are feeling the results of the tax changes. While they attracted headlines (and possibly votes), the manifesto pledges of not raising the rates of the main taxes such as income tax and VAT may, in retrospect, not have been well judged in cutting off the most obvious sources of increasing tax revenues.

Headroom is the real problem. It’s essentially a fictitious number designed to tell the gilt market the rate of increase of the nation’s indebtedness and try to convince it that the finances of UK plc are under control. Despite the sophistication of the money market, the headroom calculation can be gamed. For example, when fuel duty is frozen, it is just for a year, the assumption being it will be reinstated the following year. Future personal allowances can be frozen, increasing headroom without changing taxes today. The gods of the headroom must be appeased.

The Spring Statement shouldn’t be a big thing, but it’s increasingly feeling like it could be. Despite that, there are measures we know are very unlikely to feature on 26 March, but may well be worth considering as we look ahead to the next Autumn Budget.

Re-evaluating Corporate Tax

Realistically, 25 per cent isn’t a hugely competitive corporate tax rate – especially if the new US President aims for a rate of 15 per cent. Even if it can’t be cut, aspiring to reduce the rate will get the attention of investors. UK firms deal with a lot of red tape and the new global minimum tax requires a lot of time and brainpower. US President Trump doesn’t like it. Could it be traded away as part of a deal on tariffs?

Read more Chancellor facing £10bn headache in Spring Statement

Increasing workforce participation

Workforce participation has declined by 500,000 since Covid, so the key question is how we get those people back to work. Perhaps a special tax credit for both employer and employee if they return to work after a gap of 12 months should be considered.

Additionally, IR35 has been a bugbear for a generation. Many people do not want to be employees, but are put off by the uncertain tax status of contracting. Making the position simpler for engagers and workers may encourage many to return to the workplace.

Making the UK attractive to the wealthy

Encourage rich entrepreneurs to come to the UK or at the very least stop the wealthy voting with their feet and leaving. There was a time when encouraging City-types to come to London from all around the world was the driver of the UK economy, but this no longer seems to be the case, and it has been fashionable to use the tax system to put the wealthy off spending time here. Rather than look for ways of continuing to punish the sector – welcoming these (on average) wealth creators to spend time in the UK could help kickstart (at least the London) economy.

Boost London’s stock markets

Choosing to float a business in London has become less attractive. The Chancellor could consider removing Stamp Duty on share sales to boost the ailing London stock markets.

Similarly, don’t reduce the cash ISA thresholds, but instead double the value of stocks and shares ISAs to encourage wealthy investors to put more into the financial markets. Equally, don’t tax pensions and ISAs on death, but instead provide tax relief for the proportion invested in the UK markets.

Targeting VAT changes

VAT changes can be targeted on specific sectors that need extra stimulus. Reinstating VAT-free shopping for international tourists could help the retail and hospitality sector, especially at a time when US tariffs may make goods more expensive for domestic US consumers.

The Spring Statement presents an opportunity to try and shift the recent narrative back to the growth-focused message that was promoted so heavily last Autumn. The world has, of course, changed; President Trump has been elected, the Prime Minister has pivoted the aid budget to defence and there is talk of cutting the costs of government. Change provides the political cover to undo mistakes and change direction. The Spring Statement is a chance to do just that or maybe double down on the current direction.

Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly says the club is worth more than the £2.5bn his consortium paid

Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly believes the club is worth more now than the record £2.5bn his consortium paid to acquire them in summer 2022.

The Blues have not won a trophy or qualified for the Champions League since the takeover, while Boehly’s group has spent more than £1bn on new players.

But asked whether Chelsea had increased in value in that time, Boehly told Bloomberg: “Yeah, I would say yes.”

He added: “I think the trend is our friend in this industry. I think the opportunity to be able to grow the fanbase around the world, because, unlike American sports, we have the ability to grow internationally and build our own revenue base on that international fanbase. So I think the opportunity is enormous.

“I think the Premier League is sitting in a great place. I mean, one of the frustrating things as Chelsea owner is that the Premier League has become so competitive.

“But one of the great things about being in the Premier League is it’s gotten so competitive, so the depth and the quality of the teams are unlike any other league in Europe or anywhere in the world.

“So I think the whole element of what’s going on, because I know that it’s not really a derivative of, ‘did it win last year or did it win this year?’ I mean, this is a club that just celebrated its 120th anniversary.”

Boehly plays down tensions with Clearlake

Boehly and majority shareholder Clearlake Capital have not always seen eye to eye, but he insisted that reports of tensions in the ownership had been exaggerated.

“What the media writes about is ‘exciting’ but I just don’t think it’s realistic. If you look at the evolution of the team, we’ve been aligned on what we’re trying to do and build,” he said.

Read more Government could take Abramovich to court over £2bn from Chelsea sale

“It’s a team that’s young, that has long contracts, and all of those things were new. In order to do all those things, it’s obviously because we’re aligned. If you look at what’s actually happening you’ll see there’s core stability and ultimately we’re executing on a play that will have Chelsea where it belongs.

“We’re sitting top four in the [Premier League] table right now. The status quo is something that’s just fine. I think we’ve learned from each other, and I think we’re really going to be able to work it out any which way.”

Boehly did concede that the owners may be split on the question of how to get Chelsea into a bigger stadium than their current 40,000-capacity home Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea ‘will build a new stadium’

Redeveloping their historic base or moving to a new site – potentially Earls Court – are believed to be the most likely options, although neither is proving straightforward.

“We have a big stadium development opportunity that we have to flush out, and I think that’s going to be where we’re either aligned or we ultimately decide to go different ways,” he said.

“But again, I think that what’s been written and what’s been talked about is much more drama than what is actually happening.

“Development is going around the world right now; stadium development is definitely a theme. You’re going to see the NBA go to Europe. You’re going to see they need stadiums. They need arenas. You know, sporting infrastructure. I think we’re just on the very front end of the sporting wave, and sporting infrastructure is going to be a big thing about it.

“We have 16-20 years to figure it out. Obviously, inside of London, it’s really complex, but it’s not as if we’re building something in the middle of a rural environment. So we have a lot of constituencies to make sure that we care about – certainly, the Chelsea fan base is one – but long term, I think we’re going to be building something new, and we’ll figure it out.”",cityam

James Morehen works with the England men’s rugby team as an RFU performance nutritionist

Rugby fans watching England’s explosive renaissance at the recent Six Nations might have been left wondering just what they’d had for breakfast.

One person who knows the answer is James Morehen, men’s performance nutritionist at the Rugby Football Union and part of a backroom team that has helped Steve Borthwick’s young side emerge from the doldrums and become a force again.

“It’s a massive team effort. We’ve got a very, very talented young group of players coming through, all gearing up for the 2027 World Cup, and we’re all very excited to develop the players,” he tells City AM.

“Between myself and the chef, it’s down to us to design a menu that helps support these players, fuel and recover from the demands of test match rugby correctly. All of that together, moving in the right direction, that’s where developments with teams happen. And yeah, we had a good Six Nations.”

Morehen, who also works with Bristol Bears, boxers and racing drivers as well as private clients, is with the England squad every day they’re in camp. His job is to teach them good habits – how much protein they need, how much coffee is too much – and favours a collaborative approach.

“I’ve spent the last 18 months with those players, really getting to know them as blokes and as fathers,” he says. “Then once you’ve got that relationship it’s very easy for me to nudge them in the right direction and they’re like, ‘Okay, yeah, cool, got it’.”

From England rugby to City traders

Athletes are taking an interest in diet, having been exposed to material such as the hit Netflix documentary about veganism, The Game Changers, and of lifestyle and fitness influencers on social media. It’s a conversation starter, even if the proliferation of bogus advice is “a growing issue”, Morehen says.

He adds: “One of the problems with social media is that anyone can stand there in a sports bra or some trunks with a six pack, and go, ‘This is how you get a body like this’. But they’re not actually registered nutritionists, they haven’t actually studied the industry of nutrition and food.” In some cases, influencers may even be using substances banned in elite sport.

Away from rugby, Morehen advises boxers Chris Billam-Smith and Adam Azim, and racing driver Jamie Chadwick. He also has corporate clients “who run their own businesses and want to smash a Hyrox or Ironman at the weekend. What I love about those individuals is that, in their own right, they are still elite performers.”

He has his work cut out at one City trading firm, where some “guys there are living off of Red Bulls and a cigarette for breakfast. I say to them, ‘Look, you can stay doing this, but you’re trying to trade on barrels of oil that are worth a million dollars a day. And if you make one decimal point mistake, that could be hundreds of thousands of dollars.”

Morehen has some sobering advice for those in the Square Mile who like a lunchtime beer. “One pint is the [calorific] equivalent of a Mars bar, so if you’re having that pub lunch three times a week you’re having six Mars bars a week,” he says. “Anyone will know that that’s probably the reason they’ve got the beer belly.”

Glamorous world of the Edwardians to be explored in major exhibition at The King’s Gallery

This spring, a major exhibition at The King’s Gallery, Buckingham Palace will immerse visitors in the glamour and opulence of the Edwardian era.

The Edwardians: Age of Elegance will explore the lives and tastes of two of Britain’s most fashionable royal couples – King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, and King George V and Queen Mary – from their family lives and personal collecting to their glittering social circles, global travels and spectacular royal events.

The first Royal Collection Trust exhibition ever to explore the Edwardian era will bring together more than 300 items – almost half on display for the first time – including fashion, jewellery, paintings, photographs, books, sculpture and ceramics.

Visitors will see works from the Royal Collection by many of the period’s most celebrated names, including Carl Fabergé, Frederic Leighton, Edward Burne-Jones, Laurits Tuxen, John Singer Sargent, Olive Edis, Philip de László, William Morris, Oscar Wilde and Edward Elgar.

Royal Collection Enterprises Limited 2024 | Royal Collection Trust

Curator Kathryn Jones said: ‘The Edwardian era is seen as a golden age of style and glamour, which indeed it was, but there is so much more to discover beneath the surface. This was a period of transition, with Britain poised on the brink of the modern age and Europe edging towards war. Our royal couples lived lavish, sociable, fast-paced lives, embracing new trends and technologies. Yet in their collecting we also see a need to retain tradition and record the rapidly changing world around them, as if to preserve a fading way of life. The outbreak of World War I shattered their world, marking the end of an age and forever changing the face of monarchy.’

In 1863, Queen Victoria’s eldest son Albert Edward married Princess Alexandra of Denmark, in the first royal wedding to take place at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle. The marriage of the fashionable young couple – the future King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra – ushered in a glamorous new era for the royal family. With Queen Victoria still in mourning, Edward and Alexandra established their own vibrant court, filled with contemporary art, opulent balls and society events – a lifestyle later continued by their son, the future King George V, and his wife Queen Mary.

Royal Collection Enterprises Limited 2024 | Royal Collection Trust

The two couples were famous for their style, with Alexandra named by Vogue as ‘the legitimate head of fashion throughout the British dominions’. Visitors will see examples of Alexandra and Mary’s dazzling jewellery – including Alexandra’s Dagmar necklace, a wedding gift from the King of Denmark, and Mary’s ‘Love Trophy’ Collar necklace, on display for the first time. Alongside these, paintings of magnificent court events by Laurits Tuxen and portraits by the most fashionable society painters of the day, including Philip de László and John Singer Sargent, will capture the era’s spectacular fashions.

Displays will evoke the fashionably cluttered interiors of the royal couples’ private residences at Marlborough House and Sandringham House, where decorative objects and family photographs covered every surface. Examples will include a Cartier crystal pencil case set with diamonds and rubies, on show for the first time, and more than 20 items by the Russian jeweller Fabergé, including a blue enamel cigarette case featuring a diamond-encrusted snake biting its own tail, given to Edward in 1908 by his favourite mistress as a symbol of eternal love. The British royal family were introduced to Fabergé by Alexandra’s sister Dagmar, the wife of the Tsar of Russia, and became avid collectors.

Edward and Alexandra, and later George and Mary, surrounded themselves with fashionable society figures – known as the ‘Marlborough House Set’ – and their lives were full of garden parties, concerts, sporting events and costume balls. Visitors will see souvenirs and mementos from these events, including a never-before-seen photograph of Edward in fancy-dress as a knight of the Order of Malta, at a ball celebrating Queen Victoria’s 1897 Diamond Jubilee, attended by 700 guests in historical costume.

All four figures collected works by the great contemporary artists of the period. Visitors will see highlights from their private collections, including a previously unseen study of Sleeping Beauty by the Pre-Raphaelite artist Sir Edward Burne-Jones and luminous portraits by Frederic Leighton and Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema – both artistic advisors and friends to Edward and Alexandra. Charles Baugniet’s After the Ball, on show for the first time in over a century, captures the elegance and exuberance of the era, with a society beauty asleep on the sofa, still dressed in her ballgown.

Passionate patrons of the arts, the Edwardians enthusiastically explored new artistic movements such as Aestheticism, Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts. This is reflected in their collections, which include a copy of Oscar Wilde’s Poems, personally inscribed by the author, and an early edition of the first book printed by William Morris’s Kelmscott Press. In 1902, Edward founded the Order of Merit to recognise contributions to cultural, scientific or military life. Recipients included Sir Edward Elgar and the physicist Sir J J Thomson, and a portrait of each was drawn for the King, a tradition that continues to this day.

Royal Collection Enterprises Limited 2024 | Royal Collection Trust

The royal family also embraced the new medium of photography, both as an art form and to capture the world around them. Visitors will see works by famed photographers of the era, including the pioneering female photographers Mary Steen and Alice Hughes – as well as photographs taken by Alexandra, using portable Kodak cameras to capture official events and family moments.

Edward, Alexandra, George and Mary travelled further than any royals before them, collecting objects, receiving gifts, and employing tour artists and photographers, as well as capturing their own memories. Visitors will see items from their travels on five continents, including an Egyptian scarab brooch given to Alexandra by Edward following his tour of the Middle East in 1863; Alexandra’s handwritten notes, watercolours and snapshots from her visit to Norway in 1893; and an embroidered hanging of a eucalyptus tree, given to George and Mary by ‘the ladies of Adelaide’ during their 1901 Australia visit.

Four years into George V’s reign, war broke out, and the glitz and glamour of the Edwardian age came to an abrupt end. The royal family collected works that recorded and honoured the sacrifices made by so many during the ‘Great War’ and its aftermath – including haunting wartime landscapes by Olive Edis, Britain’s first official female war photographer, and Frank O. Salisbury’s painting showing the unveiling of the Cenotaph on 11 November 1920. By the end of the conflict, a more restrained and dutiful monarchy had emerged: a monarchy shaped for the 20th century.

A Reddit user posted a photo of a ""announcement"" posted at Costco in Orlando, Florida, USA, with the words ""From April 8, 2024, you will need a Costco membership card to purchase items from the food court.""

Four stores in the United States told Business Insider that they had been instructed to check membership cards for customers using food courts.

One employee in the management department of a store in Chicago, Illinois told Business Insider that the rules were implemented more strictly than before, with a letter sent to members in December 2023 and a ""announcement"" was posted outside the store.

日本に限らず、「1人のリーダーが世の中を変えてくれるのではないか」という願望は根強いものがあります。

政治でも企業でも、分かりやすく方向を示してくれるカリスマ的なリーダーが現れて、この状況から私たちを救い出してくれるのではないか——いわゆる「リーダー待望論」です。特に不況期や変化が必要な時の閉塞感を打ち破るには、強いリーダーが求められます。

しかし、本当にリーダー1人で、大きく状況を変えられるのでしょうか？

ムーブメントを起こすのは誰か

2010年に開催されたTEDに、おもしろいプレゼンテーションがあります。デレク・シヴァーズ氏の「社会運動はどうやって起こすか」です。話題になったプレゼンなので、ご覧になった方も多いかもしれません。

ご存じない方のために概略を説明しましょう。

シヴァーズ氏は、3分ほどの映像を見せながらプレゼンを始めます。

芝生の斜面に大勢の人が座っています。すると突然、上半身裸の男性1人がおかしな踊りを始めます。最初は彼1人ですが、しばらくすると別の男性が一緒になって踊り出します。それを見ていた1人が踊りの輪に加わって、これで3人になりました。

やがて数人のグループが合流。これをきっかけにして我も我もと人々が踊りに加わっていきます。いわゆるティッピング・ポイント（物事が急激に変化する点のこと）を超えたのです。

もはや踊りに加わることは、変なことではなくなりました。ここまで参加者が増えると、むしろ踊りに加わらない方が恥ずかしくなり、ますます参加者が増えていきます。たった3分ほどの動画ですが、ここにはムーブメントがどのように広がっていくのかのエッセンスが凝縮されています。

動画が終わると、シヴァーズ氏は次のように語ります。

「この運動が始まったきっかけは、上半身裸の1人の男が変な踊りを始めたからです。それは事実です。 しかし、そもそも1人ではリーダーではありません。このきっかけが大きな運動になったのは、2人目、3人目のフォロワーがいたからです。1人の変人をリーダーに変えたのは、2人目、3人目のフォロワーなのです。彼らがいなければ運動が起きることはありませんでした。 しかし、いつも評価されるのはリーダーだけだったりします。つまりリーダーは過大評価されているのです」

これは社会的なムーブメントに限ったことではありません。ビジネスでもNo.2の重要性を示す例はあります。ホンダの創業者で技術屋だった本田宗一郎氏と、それを経営面から支えた藤沢武夫氏は非常に有名なコンビです。ソニー創業者の井深大氏と盛田昭夫氏もしかりです。

ビジネスの世界でいうところのNo.2、No.3は、いわゆる「マネジャー」と呼ばれる人たちです。強い組織をつくるうえで、もしかしたらリーダー以上に重要なカギを握るのがこの「2人目、3番目のフォロワー」なのです。

そこで今回は、「2人目、3番目のフォロワー」たるマネジャーとはどんな人材なのか、どうすればそんなマネジャーになれるのかについてお話しすることにします。

リーダーシップとどう違う？

世に「マネジャー」と呼ばれる人は数多く存在します。厚生労働省の就業構造基本調査では、従業員100名以上の企業で管理職は20〜30万人と推計されています。同じく賃金構造基本統計調査では、実にその10倍の300万人と推計されています。かなり開きがありますが、いずれにせよかなり多くのマネジャーがいることは間違いありません。

これほど多くのマネジャーがいるのに、若い人たちと話していても「マネジャーになりたい」という声はあまり聞こえてきません。私の私見に満ちたイメージですが、マネジャーよりも「リーダー」という言葉のほうが響きがよく、またヒーロー／ヒロインとして注目されやすいので、憧れの対象になりやすいのではないでしょうか。

ではここで質問です。そもそもリーダーに必要な「リーダーシップ」と、マネジャーに必要な「マネジメントスキル」。あなたは両者の違いを説明できますか？ 本題に入る前に、まずはこのポイントを押さえておきましょう。

「リーダーシップ」は古代ギリシャから存在した

「リーダーシップ」という言葉が生まれたのは、古代ギリシャ時代にまで遡ります。リーダーシップとは生まれながらに備わった先天的なもの、というのが近代までの定説でした。

ところが1960年代から70年代の後半にかけて、学者のジョン・アデアがその常識を覆します。リーダーシップは訓練と経験によって「後天的に誰もが身に付けられる」と主張し、「リーダーの7つの実践行動」を提示しました。

ドラッカーが生み出した「マネジメント」

一方の「マネジメント」は、経営学の大家として日本でもよく知られるピーター・ドラッカーが生み出した概念だと言われています。ドラッカーは、『現代の経営」（1954年刊）や『マネジメント』（1973年刊）といった著書の中で、マネジメントを「組織に成果を挙げさせるための道具、機能、機関」と定義し、マネジメントを担う「マネジャーの5つの仕事」を提示しました。

ドラッカーの「マネジャーの5つの仕事」と前述したアデアの「リーダーの7つの実践行動」を比較すると、両者には多くの類似点があることが分かります（下図）。

筆者作成

つまりこういうことです。20世紀中盤まではリーダーシップという概念しかなく、しかもリーダーシップは「生まれながらの資質に基づくもの」と考えられていた。しかし20世紀後半になると、ドラッカーが「マネジメント」という概念を生み出し、アデアは「リーダーシップは後天的に習得できる」と従来の常識を覆した——。

マネジメントとリーダーシップに類似点が多いのはこのためです。ビジネスの場面では、ほぼ同じものだと言ってよいでしょう。

マネジャーはなぜ過小評価されるのか

次に、リーダーシップとマネジメントを具体的に実行する人、「リーダー」と「マネジャー」についても比較してみましょう。

リーダーとは多くの場合、リーダーシップを発揮する人という意味で使われます。ビジョンを描いて人々を導いていくイメージから、「リーダー」という言葉にはポジティブなイメージがありますね。

では、一方のマネジャーはどうでしょうか。マネジメントは「経営」「管理」などと訳されますが、マネジャーは多くの場合「管理職」と訳されます。そのせいか、マネジャーは「管理（だけ）する人」、つまり自分自身は行動せずにメンバーの行動を管理している人だというイメージを持っている人が多いようです。

このように、「マネジメント」と「リーダーシップ」は類似の行動をすると定義されているにもかかわらず、それらを実行する「マネジャー」と「リーダー」では想起されるイメージが違います。

本来ならばリーダーと同様に評価されていいはずのマネジャーが、「管理だけをする人」と過小評価されてしまっていることが、おそらくマネジャーの人気を下げている一因なのでしょう。

年功序列や成果主義でマネジャーにしてはいけない

「マネジャーが過小評価されている」と書きましたが、世の中を見回せば、たしかに過小評価されて当然の「イケてないマネジャー」がたくさんいるのも事実です。

「イケてないマネジャー」が量産される原因は何なのでしょうか？ 本人に原因がある場合もありますが、会社（経営者）に原因があることも少なくありません。典型的なのは次のようなパターンです。

経験年数が長い人をマネジャーにする

業績を上げた人をマネジャーにする

年功序列や成果主義でマネジャーにする、というのは多くの日本企業で行われてきたことです。今まではこれでうまく回ってきたかもしれませんが、このような人たちをマネジャーにすることで、近年では組織にほころびが出てきています。",businessinsider

今や日本人の5人に1人が予備群と言われている糖尿病。国立国際医療研究センターの糖尿病情報センターによれば、患者の数は1000万人、予備群まで併せると2000万人とも言われている。

しかも、糖尿病の初期症状は、自覚症状があまりなく、放置しがちだが、悪化すると動脈硬化や神経障害、腎症、網膜症などの合併症を引き起こすこともある。また、低血糖症状になると、昏睡状態になり死の危険性もあるのだ。健康診断などで糖尿病、糖尿病予備群と言われた場合、食生活に気をつけ、血糖をマネジメントしていく必要がある。

この糖尿病患者の血糖マネジメントに関して、リアルタイムで血糖値が計測できる画期的な製品を展開しているのがアメリカ・サンディエゴに本社があるデクスコム社だ。昨年の4月に、満を持して日本法人デクスコムジャパン合同会社として事業継承。日本市場での本格展開がスタートしている。

デクスコムジャパンは、糖尿病患者の生活をどのように変えていくのか、また、糖尿予備群の人たちや健康な人たちへのサービスなど、これからの展開と可能性について、デクスコムジャパンを率いる浅野元社長に話を聞いた。

浅野元（あさの・げん）氏／デクスコムジャパン 日本法人社長。武田薬品工業で20年以上 勤め、最後は武田台湾の社長に就任。その後、ガーダントヘルスジャパンで代表取締役社長を務め、日本のがん患者のために貢献してきた。2024年2月よりデクスコムジャパンに合流。

北米での評価と知名度は高い

デクスコムは1999年に設立された医療機器メーカーだ。全世界に1万人以上の従業員を抱えており、2005年に米ナスダックに上場。時価総額は4兆1000億円（2024年11月時点）と 、株式市場からも高い評価を受けている。

そのわけは、世界中の糖尿病患者に対して有効な「持続血糖測定（CGM：Continuous Glucose Management）」測定器が市場から評価されているからだ。

日本法人が設立されたばかりということもあり、まだ日本では知る人ぞ知る存在だが、北米では、アメリカンフットボールの大会である｢スーパーボウル｣で2回CMを放送するなど、知名度は非常に高い。

そもそも糖尿病とは、インスリンが適切に分泌されなかったり、十分に働かなかったりすることで血液中の糖が増えてしまう症状だ。逆に、低血糖の状態が続くと、最悪の場合は死に至ることもあるため、糖尿病患者はしっかりと血糖マネジメントをする必要があるのだ。

「現在、世界中の糖尿病患者さんの多くは、指先に針を刺して血糖値を測っています。しかし、この方法はその瞬間の血糖値しか分かりません。デクスコムは世界で初めて、肌にセンサーを貼るだけで、血糖値を計測できるデバイスを生み出した企業のひとつです。しかも弊社のプロダクトは常時計測するリアルタイムCGMです」（浅野氏）

血糖マネジメントの3つの方法の中でも、デクスコムが採用しているのは無線接続によるリアルタイムCGM。 提供：デクスコムジャパン

肌に貼り付けておくだけで血糖値の変化がわかる

CGMの基本的な仕組みはシンプルだ。二の腕やお腹に、アプリケーター（肌に圧着する装置）を使ってセンサーを装着する。

このときにセンサーワイヤーが皮下に挿入され、間質液（細胞と細胞の間に存在する液体）のグルコース値がリアルタイムで取得でき、モニターで見られるようになる。

このセンサーは10日間使用でき、その間のグルコース値をリアルタイムで記録する。間質液のグルコース値と血糖値には相関関係があるため、血糖マネジメントができるようになるというわけだ。

血糖値は高くても低くてもよくない。予期せぬ高血糖と無自覚性低血糖が血管や健康にダメージを与える。 提供：デクスコムジャパン

「血糖マネジメントで大切なのは、高すぎず、低すぎないようにすることです。一日数回の刺突（せんし）、針を刺して血液を出す検査では、それ以外の時間の血糖値の動きが分かりません。中には患者さん自身が無自覚な高血糖、低血糖の変動があります。リアルタイムCGMならそれが分かります」（浅野氏）

さらにデクスコムは世界で初めてスマートフォン連携機能を実現。家族のスマートフォンを連携させておけば、離れた場所にいてもリアルタイムで血糖の状態がわかるため、子どもや高齢の患者を見守る家族も安心できるのだ。

「1型糖尿病のお子さんがいる親御さんは、夜間低血糖のリスクのために、心配のあまり眠れなかったりすることも。しかし、CGMなら低血糖が近づいてきたらアラートが鳴るから安心して眠れます。また、最大10人まで連携できるので、医療機関にもリアルタイムで共有できます」（浅野氏）

日本でも活用が始まっているが……

残念ながら現在、血糖値の計測は、指先などから採血をして簡易測定器で患者自身で測定する血糖自己測定（SMBG：Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose）が主流だという。

SMBGは測定したその瞬間の血糖値はわかるが、それ以外の時間の測定値は得られず、変動を把握することは難しい。一方CGMは間質液中のグルコース濃度から血糖値を推定しており、測定値はタイムラグが生じるものの、測定値の推移を把握できる。

CGMが主流となっていない現状は、日本の医療制度や慣習などさまざまな要素が絡まった結果だ。しかし、インスリンを使っている患者ならCGMは保険適用で利用できる。しかも、患者側の費用負担は採血用穿刺器具とほとんど変わらないのだ。

「海外と大きく違うのは、日本では1型糖尿病だけでなく、2型糖尿病でも保険適用で利用できることです。より多くの糖尿病患者さんに使っていただけます。まだまだ採血用穿刺器具を使っている患者さんが多い。特に2型糖尿病の方々には普及し切れていない状況です」（浅野氏）

現在の日本には推定130万人前後のインスリン等を使用している患者がいる。そのうち、1型糖尿病の患者は約7割がCGMを使っているが、2型糖尿病の場合、2割にも満たないそうだ。今後、デクスコムジャパンでは、これまでCGMを使っていない患者に対して、認知を広げていきたいと考えている。

リアルタイムの血糖値マネジメントで生活が変わる

血糖をリアルタイムでマネジメントできるようになると生活は大きく変わる。例えば日々の食生活でも、食べ方ひとつで血糖値の変化が分かるため、野菜から食べたり、炭水化物を減らしたりするなど、見える化ができるからこそ、血糖値が上がらない食べ方の習慣化ができる。

また、CGMは血糖値の変化の予想ができるため、上昇傾向にあるとき、下降傾向にあるとき、それぞれで事前対応ができるようになる。

「実際に試用に立ち会った際、栄養ドリンクを飲むとガッと血糖値が上がるのを目の当たりにしました。糖尿病になると食事療法や運動療法について口酸っぱく言われるのですが、なかなか実行するのは難しい。しかし、数字で見えると間違いなく行動は変わります」（浅野氏）

現在、CGMはインスリンを使っている患者に保険適用されている。このため、インスリンを打っていない段階の糖尿病患者や予備群の人は利用できない。しかし、すでに一部の医療機関では、経口薬が処方されている糖尿病患者向けに選定療養としてCGMの処方が始まっている。保険は適用されず、自費にはなるがよりしっかりと血糖マネジメントができるようになる。

「弊社のミッションは『健やかな生活をご自身の力で手に入れる』ことです。血糖マネジメントを介して、患者さんやご家族の生活に貢献していきたいと考えています」（浅野氏）

1000万人以上、日本人の約12％が糖尿病を罹患しているからこそ、CGMの普及は欠かせない。デクスコムジャパンは、糖尿病患者がより健康な生活を送り、合併症や低血糖によるトラブルを起こさないために、日本での活動を活発化させていく。

Elon Musk spoke about ""anti-Tesla"" vandalism in a recent interview.

Musk denounced the political left, suggesting that vandalism could also be linked to the Ministry of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts to identify fraudulent spending.

Musk said he was confused by the hatred directed at him and Tesla, saying that Tesla is a ""peaceful"" company and that he has done nothing wrong.

Elon Musk seems to have something to say to those who destroy Tesla cars.

On March 18, when asked about vandalism against Tesla dealers and cars on Fox News, Musk criticized those involved in vandalism, saying vandalism against Tesla has reached levels that he has never seen before.

Musk also said that the vandalism was the political left-wing blame.

""It's a very shocking thing for me to have such hatred and violence from the left.""

In the US, protests have been spreading since Musk began working at DOGE in January. Overseas, the slogan ""Don't buy Tesla"" has been called out in Germany in Berlin and Wales.

Tesla Takedown, a grassroots protest that began with BlueSky, competing with Musk's X (formerly Twitter), has called on Tesla owners to sell their cars and stocks in order to ""stop masks now."" The protest website features dozens of protest demonstrations held at Tesla's showrooms in recent weeks.

""I've always thought that the Democrats are a party of sympathy, a party of compassion, but they're burning cars, setting fire to dealerships, shooting bullets, destroying Tesla cars,"" Musk said.

""Tesla is a peaceful company.""

""We've done nothing wrong.""

And without providing evidence, Musk said the series of protests and vandalism could be part of a bigger conspiracy against him.

""I mean, who's funding and who's adjusting it. It's crazy. I've never seen anything like this.""

Since January, DOGE has been working to reduce government costs and ""illegal spending"" and ""corruption."" He has dispatched DOGE representatives to several federal agencies to investigate federal programs such as the Social Security Agency.

Although he did not name individual departments, Musk accused people of ""fraudulently"" receiving money, suggesting that this was a ""connection"" between him and protests against him and Tesla.

""The bottom line is that they want to kill me because I'm stopping their injustice, and they want to hurt Tesla because we're stopping the government from gross waste and corruption,"" Musk told Fox News.

It's not easy to let go of the management of the company you created. Ask Bill Gates.

When Gates retired from Microsoft's CEO in 2000, he worried about the company's future, he said in an interview posted on March 13.

""I have two successors, and I think I'm lucky. When I left the company and started working for the foundation, what made me suffer was that I might be seeing the company decline and I was worried about whether I should return,"" Gates said.

Gates took over CEO position to Steve Ballmer, who led the company from 2000 to 2014.

In his memoir, Source Code, published in February, Gates wrote that he transferred 4% of his shares to Ballmer, and persuaded him to quit business school and join Microsoft. Shortly after joining the company in 1980, Ballmer ""became a 24-hour partner,"" Gates wrote.

Ballmer was taken over by Satya Nadella, who has been CEO since 2014.

According to Gates, his concerns were unfounded, as he now thinks about them. Because Ballmer ""takes us to new heights"" and Nadella is doing ""the most complicated CEO job in the world.""

The company has faced several important milestones since Gates' retirement from CEO.

Market capitalization rose significantly, reaching a record high of $3 trillion (approximately 447.86 trillion yen) at the end of 2024. They released their first Xbox in 2001 and acquired video game makers Mojang and Activision Blizzard. They also acquired companies such as GitHub and LinkedIn. In recent years, billions of dollars have been poured into partnerships with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.

""I'm very happy to have Microsoft support me in what I'm doing, including product reviews and learning about AI,"" added Gates.

""And you can take advantage of all the amazing resources created by Microsoft's ownership.""

Gates, who retired as CEO in 2000, was a member of the board of directors until 2020, resigned after allegations of inappropriate behavior against female employees.

Since then, he has spent much of his time at a charitable foundation he started with his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates.",businessinsider

From American whiskey to French champagne, alcohol has been a factor in President Trump's trade war.

Both will be subject to tariffs in the coming weeks unless the US agrees with the EU.

From wine shops to restaurants, businesses are already responding to possible tariffs.

President Donald Trump may not drink, but the president's trade war has shaken up the globally popular alcoholic beverage market and is causing chaos.

On March 12, 2025, the European Union announced that it would impose a 50% tariff on whiskey, one of the main alcoholic beverages in the United States, starting April 1, in response to tariffs on American aluminum and steel.

The next day, President Trump warned that he would impose 200% tariffs on EU wine and liquor, including French champagne. It is unclear when the tariffs will begin or whether the tariffs themselves will come into effect, but a response is occurring in the United States immediately.

For example, there are wine shops that promote to customers who want to stock up on European wines. One New York store sends emails to patrons recommending a bargain ""customer avoidance"" deal.

Alexandra Ivanac and her husband Stephen Varela, who runs the Italian-Croatian restaurant Villa Berulia in Manhattan, New York, said the threat from Trump is ""worrisome."" The restaurant stocks approximately 75 types of European wines, offering them for a price of 2.5 to 3 times more than most dishes.

""How should Italian restaurants change direction from European wine,"" Barrera said.

The owners of Villa Berulia are considering purchasing wine from countries outside the EU. Villa Berulia

And the question for them is whether the store will absorb the costs or pass them on to customers. Once tariffs come into effect, Ibanac said it might turn its eye on South America, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and even California wine. She also said she might order twice the usual amount of wine and keep it underground.

""Some of those wines are expensive, selling for $200 to $300, so how much more we can raise the price from there,"" Barrera said, adding that some customers are becoming more cautious about consumption due to economic concerns.

According to Eurostat, the EU's statistics bureau, the US accounts for 31% of exports of EU wine and spirits. Meanwhile, according to the American Distilled Liquor Council (DISCUS), the EU accounted for around 40% of the American spirit export market in 2023.

For American winemakers, tariff threats may be an opportunity.

Zach Pelka, co-founder of New York-based Une Femme Wines, said that the COVID-19 pandemic has made sourcing overseas complicated and expensive, making its supply chain completely complete within the US.

He said he predicts that if Trump calls 200% tariffs, the US-based liquor brands will gain more attention in the country.

Belka hopes that if the tariff threat becomes a reality, ""Une Femme"" will become an even more attractive option for restaurants, retailers, hotels and customers seeking a stable supply of wine within the United States.

""As of today, it's a selling point for buyers,"" he said of the possibility of tariffs.

The topic of tariffs has already led customers from other countries to purchase from local suppliers instead of importing them from the US. Many Canadians are seeking a ""made in Canada"" alternative after the Trump administration threatened and actually levied taxes on the country's products.

It remains to be seen whether or not some or all of the customs duties will be made into reality. The other day, President Trump imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, and soon afterwards suspended its effectiveness until April 2nd on many goods.

https://businessinsider.com,Tesla's sales will increase as a tailwind after Musk's political activities. Latest analysis of TD Cowen,https://www.businessinsider.jp/article/tesla-stock-elon-musk-politics-sales-selloff-upgrade-ev-trump-2025-3/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Stock prices have been declining since hitting a record high in mid-December, and at this point (closing price on March 21st), the decline has spread to around 48%. The market capitalization, which was up to $1.5 trillion, has shrunk to around $780 billion.

The direct cause of this slump is Musk's political involvement mentioned at the beginning.

He provided huge amounts of funds to Trump in the presidential election last November, and since the launch of the second Trump administration, he was the head of the newly established US Department of Efficiency (DOGE), and has pioneered debate with numerous actions that fueled political conflict, including sudden dismantling of government agencies and unannounced inbound inspections, and supporting German far-right parties that advocate for immigration.

Still, TD Cowen analyst Itai Micheli pointed out that Musk's moves will be a tailwind for Tesla in the future.

""There are things that people who are concerned about Tesla's future are overlooked: Tesla loses share in counties with more Democrats (due to Musk's political activities), while increasing share in groups with more Republicans. It will take some time, but Tesla can expect a significant increase in sales.""

TE Cowen has kept Tesla's investment decision unchanged, with its target stock price of $388.

EVs spread in Republican support areas

Tesla has gained fame as a pioneer in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, and has expanded sales, particularly in the liberal area, which is the Democratic support base.

However, as Musk rose to conservative stardom throughout the November 2024 presidential election, Tesla's brand is beginning to be eroded in areas that have traditionally been ""strong"" (Mikeli). In extreme cases, they are even subject to systematic boycotts and vandalism.

However, on the other hand, there are signs of growing market share in the conservative areas, which are the Republican support base. Micheli modeled the trend and created a predictive scenario and found it could bring Tesla's business to light.

""If the situation continues at stake, Tesla will certainly face headwinds before the tailwinds blow. So this is not the case for a demand forecast for the first quarter (January to March), where severe results are expected. Instead, our analysis is on a multi-year basis, and it could potentially increase sales in areas where EV penetration was previously low, offsetting losses in areas that are currently strongholds, generating profits.""

According to UD Cowen's basic scenario, Tesla's medium- to long-term sales will decline by 22-28% in Democratic-backed counties, totaling 105,000 units, but EV penetration rates will rise to 9.7% in Republican-backed counties, while Tesla's sales will increase by 107,000 units.

The changes that this trend will bring are also positive for Tesla's competitors, with General Motors, Hyundai and Ford EVs benefiting.

Wall Street's investment decisions are divided

The bright outlook for Tesla, Micheli explained, is in contrast to the successive reductions in price targets on Wall Street.

Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) has recently reduced its target stock price from the previous $440 to $320. The investment decision was kept unchanged by ""outperform.""

JPMorgan Chase also lowered its target stock price to $120 in the second week of March after Tesla revised its delivery forecast significantly downwards.

JP Morgan analysts analysts analysts analysts analysts argue that Musk's political activities are ""not interesting for the left, but it's a pleasant story for the right, but the impact on Tesla's sales is negative anyway.""

Meanwhile, major investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald raised Tesla's investment rating to overweight on March 19, leaving its target stock price at $425.

With expectations rising for the Cybercab robot taxi that Musk will begin operation in Austin, Texas in June, and the Optimus humanoid robot, the bank asks technological development for reasons to be bullish on Tesla.

Many people will be worried if they can make a ""blank period"" on their resume that they are not affiliated with any company.

The concept of ""career break,"" which positively views these ""vacancies"" due to job breaks or leave of absence as temporary suspensions, is gradually becoming more widespread.

In fact, many people have come to find new paths after their career breaks.

This time, we spoke to two people who have experienced a career break, such as quitting without deciding on a new career and going on a journey around the world, quitting a large company they had worked for for 15 years and starting a life in Georgia.

I've accumulated so far... I'm worried

Maeda Keiko (37) found a job at a major Japanese manufacturer as a new graduate, and after changing jobs after working at multiple foreign companies, she decided to make a career break.

The trigger was the presence of a husband, a digital nomad who works remotely, moving around domestically and internationally.

My husband is a freelance worker, working in a variety of positions, including web marketer and online instructor. He has loved travel since he was a student, and by the time he met Keiko, he had already traveled around the world twice.

Her husband's dream was to ""travel around the world on his honeymoon.""

However, I was confused about resigning. I think that having a ""blank period"" in your career will have a major impact on your reemployment.

Keiko, who was about to become in her mid-30s at the time, also had anxious age. ""We don't think we both want children right now, but what if we change our mindset after returning to Japan? If we're going back to work, I'd like to work for a year before going on maternity leave..."" she said, adding that she was also strongly concerned about women.

Despite his uncertainty about his career, he decided to travel around the world as he became unemployed, which also gave him a great sense of confidence that he had achieved results from his previous work.

Keiko gained experience mainly in human resources, and was often given job offers from companies. I felt that even if I couldn't return to work as a company employee after returning to Japan, I could still work as a freelance.

The couple discussed the children many times. Among them, I thought, ""At this point, we don't want children either. Don't worry too much about the future, let's try what we want first.""

After quitting her job, Keiko and her husband set out on a journey around the world, which had not yet been decided.

A change in the way my journey has changed

During the year and a half of the world trip, Keiko was able to visit Jordan, which she had always wanted to visit. Photo: Naganuma Shigeki

On a trip around the world, I visited 60 countries.

As he continued his journey, there were events that shaking his values ​​about his work.

What really struck me was when I was staying in Rwanda, central Africa. Rwanda is also known as the ""miracle of Africa"" ​​because it recovered from tragedy such as civil wars and genocides and economic growth accelerated rapidly. When Keiko actually stayed there, she was surprised by the townscape, which felt cleaner than in Japan, and how well the security was.

He was shocked to hear from a Japanese woman he met in Rwanda that, ""In Rwanda, even if you have an academic background and motivation, you don't have a job in the first place.""

In Japan, the mainstream concerns are ""assuming that you have a job,"" such as ""what kind of work you will do"" and ""Whether you will find it rewarding."" However, in Rwanda there is no ""the place to work.""

It was an experience that made me realize how blessed I am to have a job, and made me think again about my career.",businessinsider

ソフトウェア業界は、AI関連の割安銘柄を探すには絶好の場所だ。ソフトウェア銘柄は、リスク回避の流れの中で下落したが、なかには堅実なビジネスモデルと継続的な収益成長を誇る企業も含まれていた。そして、ここでのポイントは、このセクターで銘柄を探すなら、このセクターの特長は急速な成長であり、何よりも収益成長に注目すべきだと、モーニングスターのテクノロジー担当シニア株式調査アナリスト、ダン・ロマノフ（Dan Romanoff）氏は述べた。

「ソフトウェア企業の株価指標と収益成長率を比較したチャートを描くだけでよい。収益成長率が高ければ高いほど、たとえ赤字でも、株価指標は高くなる」とロマノフ氏。

「ポートフォリオを俯瞰して見たとき、テクノロジー分野は通常、最も高い成長率をもたらす。だからこそ、成長が見込める分野に積極的に投資すべきだ」

重要なことは、最も優れた成長ストーリーを見つけることだとロマノフ氏は付け加えた。そして、その答えは、驚異的な成長を遂げている企業とは限らず、むしろ収益成長の持続性を示している企業かもしれない。つまり、収益の増加は新製品の発売による一時的なもので、次の四半期には失速する可能性もあるとロマノフ氏は述べた。その違いを見極めることが、短期的な売買と長期的な投資の機会を見分ける鍵となる。

ソフトウェア業界で現在、割安になっている銘柄の1つが、マイクロソフト（Microsoft）だ。20日時点で、年初から約7%下落している。しかし、優良企業であり、嵐の中の港のような存在だとロマノフ氏は指摘した。同社はWindowsでデスクトップOSにおける独占的な地位を、また、オフィススイートで生産性ソフトウェアにおけるほぼ独占的な地位を占めている。さらに、生成AIツールを導入したことで、AI競争におけるリーダーの座に躍り出たとロマノフ氏は述べた。またアズール（Azure）は、AWS（Amazon Web Services）、Google Cloud Platformと三つ巴の競争を繰り広げるクラウドプロバイダーでもある。ロマノフ氏は、（生成AIの）推論はクラウド上で実行されるため、クラウドプロバイダーは生成AIにおける真の勝者になると考えている。

アドビ（Adobe）も、注目すべきソフトウェア企業だ。同社は純粋なAI企業ではないが、これはむしろポジティブな要素だ。なぜなら、同社は堅実で、長期的なビジネスを続けてきたことを意味するからだ。同社の株価は今年、10%以上下落している。投資家は、生成AIに取って代わられることを恐れているためだ。実際、生成AIは画像作成能力が向上しており、アドビのプラットフォームが不要になる可能性がある。しかし、ロマノフ氏は、アドビの生成AI「FireFly」（テキストから画像、テキストから動画への変換機能を提供）は今後も必要とされると考えている。

「生成AIによって作成されたコンテンツを編集するツールは、引き続き必要とされるだろう」とロマノフ氏。

「広告業界で、キャンペーンのクリエイティブを作成している場合、作成した画像は、ブランドイメージを生み出し、届け、定義するために、きわめて厳密に編集する必要がある」

ソフトウェア業界では、サービスナウ（ServiceNow）も注目だ。同社はカスタマーサービスとITプラットフォームの提供で成功している。2024年第4四半期（10-12月期）の収益は前年から21.34%増加した。しかし、株価は年初から22%近く下落している。同社は堅実な長期的ビジネスを展開しており、生成AIによる収益はわずかだとロマノフ氏は指摘した。そして、ソフトウェアプロバイダーにとって重要な指標である年間継続収益は、堅調な成長軌道を維持していると付け加えた。

「マグニフィセント・セブン」の他の銘柄が気になる人もいるだろう。いくつかの銘柄も割安になっている。モーニングスターの5つ星格付けシステムによると、アマゾン（Amazon）、アルファベット（Alphabet）、メタ（Meta）の3銘柄は現在、4つ星評価となっている。

さらに、現在割安で、4つ星評価を受けている「ピック・アンド・シャベル」銘柄には、ASML、アドバンスト・マイクロ・デバイス（AMD）、マーベル・インターナショナル（Marvell International）がある。

最先端分野に投資したい投資家にとって、ロボティクスは、たとえ割安でなくてもAIとのインテグレーションによって、大きく飛躍する準備が整っている。この2つのセクターを合わせると現在、世界のGDPの1%を占めている。そしてVettaFiによると、2040年までに35%にまで拡大すると予想されている。需要は、製造、ヘルスケア、物流、農業などのエンドユーザーから生まれる。この成長余地は、投資家にとって1兆ドル規模のチャンスを生み出す。

しかし、このセクターへの投資はより難しいものになる可能性がある。なぜなら、企業の過去のファンダメンタルズは、将来の成功を測る最適な尺度とはならないからだ。VettaFiのディープテック分野の投資家兼リサーチャー、ゼノ・マーサー（Zeno Mercer）氏は、企業を評価する際には、AIまたはロボティクス関連のサブセクターへの貢献度を基準にすべきだと指摘した。また、技術的リーダーシップ、提携先など市場内でのポジション、存在感を高めるための戦略的投資を行っているかどうかも評価する必要がある。

さらに、技術的リーダーシップ、市場内でのポジション（どの企業と提携しているかなど）、そして存在感を高めるための戦略的投資も評価する必要があるという。

VettaFiのロボ・グローバル・ロボティクス・オートメーション・インデックス（ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index）は、このセクターの世界的トップ企業を探すことに有用だ。同インデックスの上位銘柄には、ロボット用精密制御機器メーカーのハーモニック・ドライブ・システムズ（Harmonic Drive Systems）、ロボットメーカーのファナック、産業用・製薬用・化学用機器メーカーのGEAグループAGなどがある。",businessinsider

Fourth, the US dollar has been falling in recent weeks, meaning companies with strong sales in overseas markets could see a series of moves to upwardly revise their performance outlook.

Finally, the company said that a fall in interest rates in 2025 could boost the US Economic Surprise Index, which could also lead to a rise in stock prices.

We maintain our forecast that 5500 will be the support line for the rise led by circular stocks, low quality stocks and high-value growth stocks that have been hit hardest and have the highest short positions. Price movements on March 14th seem to support that forecast.

Morgan Stanley's Chief Investment Officer Mike Wilson wrote on the 17th:

Citi seems to agree.

Analysts said the recent decline in stock prices has made the S&P 500 valuation healthy. Meanwhile, the bank said that technology stock Magnificent Seven has also received a more ""rational rating."" The top group of technology stocks currently accounts for approximately 9% of the S&P 500 total returns since December 2023, but is a significant decline compared to 2024.

The S&P 500 is down 10% from its all-time high in February. The decline is balancing stock risk and returns ""upward,"" analysts said.

""We have set 5500 as one standard as the level at which the balance between risk and return begins to lean more favorably,"" City said.

In the long run, factors like increased productivity, AI potential, efficiency in business operations, shareholder influence, and ongoing business model maturation better represent our view on American exceptionalism, which makes us essentially positive about the S&P 500.

City's optimistic outlook is noteworthy. This is because the bank has recently re-adjusted its view on US stocks, including downgrading its US stock outlook to ""neutral"" and raising the Chinese stock outlook to ""bulwark.""

Both Morgan Stanley and City analysts have kept their year-end target at 6,500. This means that the S&P 500 will rise by around 15% by the end of 2025.

A weak view

However, there are still some bearish views on Wall Street as traders are worried about the possibility of slowing America's growth.

Goldman Sachs and RBC recently reduced the S&P 500 target to 6,200.

Citi says that while it's not a basic scenario, the S&P 500 could fall to 5,100, assuming policy uncertainty and growth concerns continue to strain sentiment.

Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley expects the index could fall to 4,600 in the event of a recession, meaning a 18% drop from March 17th levels.

We believe it is important for the S&P 500 to bounce back at around 5,500 levels, given fundamental and technical support. If it doesn't bounce back, it can be said to be a sign that growth could be worsening faster than expected, and that our bearish scenario is increasingly at an increased risk of recession as it could become a reality.

One thing is clear: the market should not expect the Trump administration to bail out the stock market anytime soon. The president's team has repeatedly shown that it is not focusing on the market, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying he has ""at least"" concern about the recent stock price decline.

I have worked in the investment industry for 35 years and the adjustments are healthy and normal. Continuing to rise straight is not healthy.

Bescent told NBC, adding that he believes the market will perform ""great"" in the long run.

His remarks came a week after President Trump acknowledged that the administration's policies could lead to a recession in the United States.",businessinsider

This has transformed Tesla into a political symbol, of course, which is not good for investors.""

Ives presented Tesla with a prescription, which was at a turning point.

""If Musk wants to bring this crisis to an end, so that the Tesla brand crisis that we've built up to this point will become snowballed over the next few years and eventually turn into a Black Swan (an unpredictable, hugely impactful extreme event), then we have to tackle two things.""

One is to explain in his own words how Musk will manage Tesla's management and role as head of the Ministry of Government Efficiency Ministry at the first quarter (January to March) earnings announcements, or at the information session, scheduled for early May.

""To continue investing in Tesla, we need to take a step back (from the current state of leaning forward to the Ministry of Government Efficiency) and make sure that Musk is balanced.""

Even if Musk takes a step back, Ives analyzes that the ""overheating"" surrounding Musk as the Ministry of Government Efficiency and its director will ""cold.""

Not everything will resolve comfortably, and although the marks engraved on the Tesla brand will not disappear easily, it is said that it will be possible to avoid a development that will prevent the damage from recovering forever.

Another is to clarify the ""roadmap of development for low-cost EVs and when to market,"" which Tesla has announced to launch within the year, and also provide a detailed perspective on the ""robotic taxi service to be launched in Texas from June.""

Ives believes that there are a lot of issues, including the complete revamp of the Model Y, the main SUV (multipurpose sports car), the issue of inventory management (surplus), and the sluggish demand due to brand damage, and investors will not be convinced unless Musk himself explains what he thinks about these issues.

Of course there are disagreements

Not all investors, like Ives, see Tesla's situation as a ""crisis"" and have a pessimistic outlook.

Tsai Capital President and Chief Investment Officer Christopher Tsai recently spoke to Business Insider and emphasized that it is important to separate Musk's behavior as director of the Ministry of Government Efficiency and his involvement at the heart of the US government (in a position to exert influence).

""Elon is in a position to form policies (in favor of Tesla's business expansion) by engaging in the government. I think negative market sentiment will eventually fade and disappear.""",businessinsider

テスラの株価が史上最高値を更新した2024年12月前後に初めて購入した投資家なら、この急落に恐怖を感じるのも無理はない。しかし、報酬を株式で受け取って長期保有している従業員たちの目に映る景色は、短期投資家たちとは全く異なるようだ。

ある従業員からはこんな正論が聞かれた。

昨年の同時期（つまり2024年3月中旬）と比べればまだ30〜40％高い水準だし、ましてや5年前との比較なら690％も上昇していて、とんでもない水準であることに変わりはないと。

一方、それとは別の複数の従業員が、株価の変動にはあえて目を向けないようにしていると口を揃えた。その中のテキサス拠点に勤務するある従業員は「毎日株価を見ていたら気が変になるよ」と語った。

株価パフォーマンスに影響を及ぼす変数はいくつもあって、もちろんイーロン・マスク最高経営責任者（CEO）の各種行動もその一つだが、それは従業員がどうこうできるものではない（から考えても仕方がない）、というのがその従業員のスタンスだった。

そうした意見は、Business Insider編集部が直接取材していない従業員にとっても、特段違和感のないもののようだ。

テスラ社内のコミュニケーションツールには、株価の値動きをテーマに一部の従業員が意見を交換する場として利用している非公式チャンネルが存在し、そこでも（株価下落に対して）特に際立った反応はないと複数の従業員が証言する。

同チャンネルには一部の従業員と言っても数千人が参加しており、自社に関係するソーシャルメディア投稿やニュース記事を共有するのに使われているという。

ネバダ拠点に勤務するある従業員はそれらを総合して、社内には「陰うつな空気」も「危機感」も漂っていないと語った。

自社株を保有する従業員の心理

テスラにおいて株式報酬の付与は大きな役割を果たしており、それを同社の最も魅力的な特徴の一つと考えている従業員も少なくない。

マスク氏もそれをよく分かっていて、テスラの生産拠点はミリオネアを多数輩出してきたと過去に発言している（米経済誌フォーチュン、2023年11月30日付）。

従業員の中にはそれと異なる立場もある。近頃退社したある従業員はこう指摘する。

「付与された株式報酬の価値が跳ね上がって一気に富裕層の仲間入り、といったシナリオに期待してテスラで働いている従業員がいることは間違いありませんが、そういう人に限って長続きしないのが現実です」

また、別の従業員2人は、株価のボラティリティ上昇（により報酬が目減りするリスクの増大）を受け、「長期キャッシュ」型の報酬オプションを選んだことを、Business Insiderに明かした。業績を反映して決定したインセンティブ報酬を、その後数年（通常4年間）にわたって繰り延べて現金支給する仕組みという。

Business Insiderが独自入手したテスラ社内の給与関連書類（2021年時点）によると、同じテクノロジー業界や自動車業界の企業に比べてベースサラリー（基本給）は見劣りするものの、インセンティブ報酬としての株式付与が大きい。

年次報告書の記載によれば、テスラは2024年に譲渡制限付株式ユニット（RSU）で約26億9000万ドル、ストックオプション（新株予約権）で約35億ドルを従業員に付与している。

上述の長期キャッシュ型報酬を選んだ従業員2人は、自分たちを含むテスラの従業員にとって株価の変動は大きな関心事ではないと強調した。

マスク氏はデフォルトで物議を醸す存在

テスラは今、経営トップであるマスク氏のトランプ大統領との親密な間柄や、米政府効率化省（DOGE）の責任者としての発言力、影響力がハレーションを引き起こし、国民からの強い抗議とそれを要因の一つとする株価急落に直面している。

ニューヨーク・タイムズ（New York Times）はこの2月、マスク氏がX投稿でナチスの親衛隊長だったヒムラーや、総統ヒトラーの後継者と目された国家元帥のゲーリングらに不適切な形で言及したことを批判したテスラのマネジャー、ジャレッド・オットマン氏が解雇されたと報じた。

しかし、Business Insiderの取材に応じたテスラのあるエンジニアは、従業員がマスク氏についてさまざまな形で繰り返し質問を受けることに苛立ちを感じていると前置きした上で、こう語気を強めた。

「自分の会社のCEOについて考える機会って、どのくらいありますか？CEOの行動に個人的に責任を負っているって考えてますか？」

そのように社内にはさまざまな意見や見方があるものの、取材に応じた10人の従業員のうち8人が口を揃えたのは、会社の先行きはおおむね安泰だろう、ということだった。

インフレが資産にどのような影響を与えるか不安に感じていた私は、ファイナンシャルプランナーに聞いてみた。

まずは現金の確認頻度を増やし、必要なら支出を削減するようアドバイスを受けた。

また、いますぐ余剰現金をため込むのをやめ、高金利負債を返済しなければならない。

最近、会話中の登場頻度が増えた気がするのが、インフレーションという金融用語だ。インフレなど各種要因でレストランのメニューが値上げされると聞けば、夕食時にインフレが話題になる。むろん、食料品店やガソリンスタンド、小売店で価格を見て回るときも然りだ。

インフレが盛んに話題に出るようになったので、自分のパーソナルファイナンスや投資について考えるべきことなのかと思い始めた。もしそうなら、何をどのように始めるべきだろうか？

「計画を立てる際、絶対に頭に入れておかなければならないのがインフレだ。インフレは、資産や元本、購買力を蝕むためステルス税と言われる」とファイナンシャルプランナーのエリック・ブロットマン氏は言う。

Advertisement

「厄介なのは、今のようなインフレは何年も起こっていないことだ。つまり、インフレを経験していない世代が誕生している」

そこで私は複数のファイナンシャル・アドバイザーに、インフレ時代に現金をどうしたらよいかアドバイスを求めることにした。

1. 資産の確認頻度を増やす

私は毎週資産を必ずチェックするが、ファイナンシャルプランナーのマリニー・デ・モーリアック氏は、インフレは入れ違いで資産に影響を与えることがあるので、予算アプリを注視するようにと言う。

「すべての品目が同じペースで値上がりするわけではない。キャッシュ・フローを定期的に見直すことが欠かせない」とデ・モーリアック氏は言う。

「月に1度日付を設定し、カレンダーに入れておこう。いくら入ってきて、何に支出するか確認しておきたい。例えば、ガソリン価格の上昇が激しく、自動車通勤でガソリン代がかさんでいるなら、支出超過を避けるため他の品目への支払いを減らさなければならないだろう。そうした取り組みはすぐに効果が出なくても、時間が経つにつれて塵も積もれば山となる」

2. 現金保有額を見直す

私は多額の現金を高金利預金に入れているが、ブロットマン氏は間違った判断だという。インフレは資産形成の阻害要因だと認識することが大事だ。

ブロットマン氏は言う。

「現金価値の上昇ペースが財やサービス価格の上昇に追い付かないため、現金に対するリターンは実質的にマイナスになる。（インフレになれば）現金はもはや富の形成に役立つ資産ではない。緊急時や流動性確保のために現金は持っておくべきだが、現金価値は下落し続ける。いまこそ余剰現金を別の資産クラスに分散させる時かもしれない」

3. 借金から抜け出す

インフレはさまざまな形で個人資産に打撃を与えるが、その1つが負債への影響だ。ファイナンシャルプランナーのジェイ・ジグモント氏は、インフレの時には借金返済に注力することが大事、と説く。

ジグモント氏は言う。

「インフレと金利上昇のダブルパンチは、多くの人たちにとって失う部分が増えるということだ。クレジットカードの平均金利も上がるだろう。金利上昇はすべての価格を押し上げるので、借入残高と毎月の最低返済額がどちらも増加する」

ジグモント氏は、これ以上新たな借金をしないようにクレジットカード利用の停止を勧める。

「借金返済を進めるつもりなら、新たに借りるのはやめなければならない。そして、できるだけ早く借金を返済する目標を立てよう」

Advertisement

4. 所得を増やそう

「インフレでライフスタイルや予算が劇的に変わりつつあるなら、キャッシュ・フローの見直しだけでなく、財やサービス価格の上昇を賄うために所得を増やす方法を考えよう」とデ・モーリアック氏は言う。

「2つ目のアルバイトを見つける、副業を始める、スキルアップやキャリアチェンジを図る、昇進や昇給を交渉する、新しい仕事の機会を模索することかもしれない。事業主ならば、サービスの品ぞろえや請求体系を見直して、所得増加の新たな機会を見つけると良いだろう」

5. 債券投資を再考する

投資ポートフォリオをチェックする時には、インフレ上昇期に最も影響を受ける負債証券（債券、現金、譲渡性預金［CD］など）を注視すべきと、ファイナンシャルプランナーのヘイリー・エリスは言う。

トリツキー氏は言う。

「金利が上昇すると、表面利率が高い債券が発行されるため、既存の債券価格が下落する。投資ポートフォリオに債券を組み入れているならば、運用期間の投資手法が保守的になり過ぎないよう留意しよう。金利変動に敏感な長期債ではなく、短中期債を検討した方が良い。反対に株式は、景気変動に伴い短期的に価格が変動するかもしれないが、長い目で見ればインフレをはるかに上回るペースで上昇する傾向にある」

音楽ライブは安定して成長しており、不況の間も持ちこたえることができている。

ゴールドマン・サックスは、この業界が歴史的に見て不況に強い理由を5つ示した。

同行は、支出を切り詰めている場合でも、人々が音楽ライブを出かけていることを明らかにしている。

景気後退の話題が、ウォール街でますます広がっている。だが、たとえアメリカが本格的な不況に陥ったとしても、ある業界は安定して嵐を乗り切ることができる。それは、音楽ライブだ。

ゴールドマン・サックス（Goldman Sachs）はそう述べ、音楽ライブをエンターテイメントの他の形態よりも「不況に強い」と評価した。

1990年から30年以上、音楽ライブ業界は景気後退期に平均7.3％の成長を見せ、エンターテイメントの他の分野をしのいでいることを同行は明らかにした。

さらに、1990年以降、ライブエンターテイメントへの支出は735％急騰している。これはエンターテイメントにおける他のあらゆる形態、例えば、ギャンブル、スポーツ、劇場などをしのいでいるとゴールドマン・サックスは政府支出データを分析して示した。

「歴史的に見て、音楽ライブ業界は経済が不安定な時期にも、比較的強い回復力を示している」とスティーブン・ラシュチク（Stephen Laszczyk）率いるストラテジスト・チームは3月17日、顧客へのメモに書いた。

ゴールドマン・サックスは、音楽ライブが特に不況に強い理由を5つ挙げている。

1. 確立された業界である

過去30年で、音楽ライブ市場はニッチからメインストリームへと成長し、不況時にも音楽業界を支えてきた。

カスタム・マーケット・インサイツ（Custom Market Insights）によると、音楽ライブの世界市場規模は2024年、約348億ドル（約5兆1800億円）に達しており、今後10年間で625億ドル（約9兆3000億円）まで成長すると予想されている。

「比較的小規模な基盤から成長したことと、長年にわたり発展してきた強力で長期的追い風が相まって、個人消費が落ち込んでいる時期の影響を受けない複利的な収益成長を後押しした」とゴールドマン・は述べた。

2. 大規模な二次市場が存在し、公式のチケット販売者への悪影響が少ない

コンサートのチケットには巨大なリセール市場が存在し、市場を個人消費の落ち込みから保護している。

2019年、チケット転売業者は音楽イベント大手のライブネーション（Live Nation）の公演で、13億ドル（約1934億900万円）の利益を上げたと推定されている。

「我々はこの利益のプールを、個人消費の落ち込みを吸収する緩衝材だと見ている。例えば、不況の場合、二次市場が限界需要に対する圧力の大部分を吸収し、音楽ライブ業界の基礎的な収益性を保護することが期待される」とゴールドマンのアナリストは述べている。

3. 音楽ライブがグローバルになっている

音楽ライブは、ヨーロッパや北アメリカを大きく超え、今やコンサートの世界需要の大部分をラテン・アメリカやアジアが占めるようになった。この広がりが、アメリカ経済があまり良くない時にも、業界を守っている。

4. 比較的価値あるものを提供している

チケットの価格は過去数十年、インフレ率を超えるペースで上がっているが、コンサートは依然として、他のライブエンターテイメントの形態と比べ、まだ比較的安い。

ライブネーションのトップ100のコンサートの平均価格は2022年、約106ドル（約1万5800円）前後だった。それでも、平均約258ドル［約3万8000円］だったナショナル・フットボール・リーグ（NFL）の試合のチケットや、ブロードウェイ（Broadway）のショーのチケットの平均約133ドル［約1万9800円］よりも安いとゴールドマンの分析は示している。

音楽ライブは、他のライブ・エンターテイメントと比較して、相対的に魅力的な価値を提供し続けている。 Live Nation/ESPN/Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research

「コンサートの相対的な手頃さ（と価値）が、エンターテイメントの他の高価格形態に比べ、音楽ライブを不況に強いものにしていると我々は考えている」と同行は書いている。

5. 消費者は支出を切り詰めていても、音楽ライブを優先している

消費者はコンサート体験を諦められないようだ。たとえ、財布の紐を固くしなければならないプレッシャーがある時であっても。

支出を減らさなければならない時に、最初に音楽ライブ・イベントを控えると述べた人は、わずか6％だった。一方、ギャンブルは67％、スポーツ・イベントでは28％だったことが、2019年のライブネーションの調査で分かった。

The MSCI ACWI (MSCI All Country World Index) index also saw a slight increase in closing price on the 21st last weekend.

Compared to S&P 500-linked funds in Japan, price movements are smaller. Some of the cases have slightly decreased.

The average hourly rates of freelancers are highest in Utrecht and Noord-Brabant.

The importance of sectors can play a role in the differences per province. In most provinces, business services are the largest sector.

The hourly rates of freelancers have been raised by around 5 percent in the past year. According to the Online Bank Knab, the average hourly rate for independent entrepreneurs is now 81 euros. However, there are considerable differences per profession. In addition, there is also the necessary variation regionally.

In Utrecht and Noord-Brabant, self-employed people on average use the highest hourly rates, according to research by KNAB among 20,000 independent entrepreneurs. The self-employed rates are the lowest in Friesland in diameter.

The table below gives the overview of self-employed rates per province.

In Utrecht and Noord-Brabant, the average hourly rate is 84 euros, while this is 71 euros in Friesland. The overview above shows that the average turnover of self -employed people who have been questioned by Knab is around 100,000 euros in 2024 with a profit margin around 60 percent.

Hourly rates of self -employed people: business services versus construction

Financial expert Oskar Barendse of Knab emphasizes in an explanation that hourly rates and profit do not tell the whole story. ""In some provinces, the housing costs and personal costs are lower, which gives room to do well with a slightly lower rate. It also plays a role as many hours a person can invoice and how efficiently a self -employed person deals with his costs and taxes.""

The importance of sectors can also play a role in the differences per province. In most provinces, business services are the largest sector among freelancers, says Knab. In the provinces of Groningen, Drenthe and Limburg, however, the construction sector is in first place. This is important because in sectors such as business services and IT the margins and rates are often higher than in construction, care or personal services.",businessinsider
https://businessinsider.com,The power of periodic investing: this is the advantage,https://www.businessinsider.nl/de-kracht-van-periodiek-beleggen-dit-is-het-voordeel-van-elk-maand-een-vast-bedrag-opzij-zetten-om-vermogen-op-te-bouwen/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 13:34:30 GMT","For periodic investing, for example, you can put a fixed amount aside every month and put them in an index fund.

The advantage is that you are automatically remedied between periods in which stock prices are high or low.

Beurs expert Hendrik Oude Nijhuis shows that this can produce surprising results.

Analysis = an attractive way of investing is periodic investing, for example with income that you can set aside every month. You prefer to do this automated and as much as possible emotionless.

Periodic investing ensures that you automatically agree between periods in which stock prices are high or lower. Since you always invest a fixed amount per month, you buy fewer shares when the rates are high and more when the rates are low.

Suppose you invest 240 euros in an index fund every month. And suppose three scenarios such as below. The price scenarios for a period of five months are extreme, but that is to make clear the benefits of periodic investing. If you take into account a longer investment horizon of, for example, ten years, then the scenarios below are not even so extremely.

Three scenarios for periodic investing

In Scenario A there is successive the following five rates: 20 euros, 40 euros, 40 euros, 60 euros and 60 euros. Many investors see this as an ideal scenario: races that rise or at least do not fall.

Because you invest 240 euros every month, you can buy twelve shares in this scenario in the first month, six shares in the second month, and so on after five months you have 32 shares.

In Scenario B the price jumps firmly up and down and at the end of the period it is only half of that of Scenario A. The price trend in scenario B is as follows: 20 euros, 30 euros, 20 euros, 10 euros and 30 euros.

Scenario C is the disaster scenario. Imagine to have started investing just before the attacks of September 11, 2001 or at the start of the pandemic. In this scenario, the course at the end of the period is just back. The price development in Scenario C: 20 euros, 10 euros, 5 euros, 10 euros and 20 euros.

Which scenario do you choose?

Many investors undoubtedly opt for scenario A for his or her investments, with rates that rise or at least do not fall. And those who started investing on the eve of Scenario C may easily stop it again. But whether that would be wise can still be seen.

In Scenario A you had bought 32 shares during the five months. At the end of the period the rate is 60 euros so together they are good for 1,920 euros.

In the Volatile Scenario B you could have purchased 64 shares, the double number compared to Scenario A. Since the price at the end of the period is now 30 euros (half of that of Scenario A) your investment is also worth 1,920 euros in this case.

In Scenario C, the disaster scenario, you could have purchased 120 shares in the five months. And at the rate of 20 euros these are good for 2,400 euros, or most of all. A strongly fluctuating index or an unfolding 'disaster scenario' is not nearly as unfavorable in the event of periodic investing as often assumed in the first instance.

Here's a recap of Monday's key moments. 1. Wall Street got off to a strong start Monday, with the Nasdaq leading the way up 2%. The S & P 500 was up more than 1.5% while the Dow was up over 1%. The rally was sparked by hope that President Donald Trump will soften his stance on putting reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners that place levies on American goods. The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks — Apple , Alphabet , Amazon , Meta Platforms , Microsoft , Nvidia , and Tesla — were all higher. The Club owns all of them, except Tesla, which was up more than 9% on Monday. But the EV maker's shares were still down over 30% in 2025, due in part to tariff uncertainty and investor concerns about customer backlash to CEO Elon Musk's role in downsizing the federal government. Elsewhere, Apple CEO Tim Cook was among the U.S. business executives in China at a government development conference . 2. The market got a lift Friday on Trump's ""flexibility"" comments on reciprocal tariffs, set to go into effect on April 2. And then over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump is adopting a more targeted approach to the tariffs. Bloomberg News reported that some nations will be excluded from tariffs. Jim Cramer said these reports indicated that Trump is monitoring the stock market and investors should keep that in mind. ""I think we have to get away from the idea that he's not paying attention [to the stock market].The president cares, and this is what you're seeing. That's why it's going up,"" Jim said, referring to Monday's market rally. In his Sunday column , Jim said don't let all the noise out of Washington keep you out of the market. To be sure , the president on Monday said any country that purchases oil from Venezuela will have to pay 25% tariff on trade with the U.S. 3. Jim was back at the New York Stock Exchange on Monday after a week on the West Coast, which started in Silicon Valley for Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's GTC keynote last week . Jim said Monday that his meeting with Jensen and other tech CEOs were all bullish. He emphasized that there's a contingent of speculative traders that are trying to put Nvidia's stock down. Jim's next stop was Las Vegas for Home Depot's managers meeting, and he also met with Wynn Resorts CEO Craig Billings while there. Jim's takeaways: Home Depot is poised to be a big stock this year and Wynn shares are getting a raw deal in the market for what it has to offer in Vegas but especially Macao. 4. Stocks covered in Monday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: Boeing , Lockheed Martin , Generac Holdings , Pinterest , and Super Micro .

Countries that buy oil and gas from Venezuela will face tariffs on any trade they have with the U.S., Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. The tariffs take effect on April 2, the president said.

Venezuela exported about 660,000 barrels per day in 2024, according to data from Kpler. China was the largest destination for the South American nation's crude exports, purchasing 270,000 bpd last year.

""This announcement by the Trump administration appears to be one more action targeting China,"" Matt Smith, an oil analyst at Kpler, told CNBC.

Brent crude futures rose 61 cents, or 0.85%, to $72.77 a barrel by 1:15 p.m. ET. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 59 cents, or 0.86%, at $68.87.

""We expect oil prices to go higher in light of this news and may rise further if Trump follows through with this proclamation,"" analyst Leo Mariani at Roth told clients in a note.

The U.S. was the second-largest destination for Venezuelan crude last year, importing about 233,000 bpd, according to Kpler. India purchased about 61,000 bpd and Spain bought nearly 60,000 bpd in 2024.

Trump has sought to increase pressure on the Maduro regime since taking office. The president accused Venezuela of sending Tren de Aragua gang members to the U.S. when announcing the tariffs on Monday. The Trump administration has designated the gang as a foreign terrorist organization.

Trump said in late February that he would reverse a Biden administration decision which allowed Chevron to restart oil production in Venezuela. The Treasury Department gave the oil major until April 3 to wind down its operations in Venezuela.

Trump, however, expressed openness to extending Chevron's license to produce oil in Venezuela during a meeting at the White House last week with the oil major's CEO Mike Wirth and other fossil fuel industry executives, people familiar with the discussions told The Wall Street Journal.

The tariffs are intended to make it more difficult for China to gain a foothold in Venezuela's oil industry while bolstering Chevron and ensuring oil flows to the U.S., the people told the Journal.

Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act on March 15 in response to what the president claims is an invasion by Tren de Aragua. The president said its members are conducting ""irregular warfare"" against the U.S. at the direction of Maduro.

Federal District Court Judge James Boasberg has blocked Trump's plan to deport alleged members of Tren de Aragua using the Alien Enemies Act. Trump has called for Boasberg's impeachment, sparking fears among some legal experts that the U.S. is facing a constitutional crisis. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has rebuked Trump's calls for Boasberg to be removed.",cnbc

Embattled genetic testing company 23andMe , once valued at $6 billion, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Missouri federal court on Sunday night.

The company's CEO, Anne Wojcicki, has resigned from her role as chief executive effective immediately, though she will remain a member of the board. Joseph Selsavage, 23andMe's chief financial and accounting officer, will serve as interim CEO, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

""We have had many successes but I equally take accountability for the challenges we have today,"" Wojcicki wrote in a post on X early Monday morning. ""There is no doubt that the challenges faced by 23andMe through an evolving business model have been real, but my belief in the company and its future is unwavering.""

23andMe declined to comment further on the filing.

The former billionaire co-founded 23andMe in 2006, and the company rocketed into the mainstream because of its at-home DNA testing kits that gave customers insight into their family histories and genetic profiles. The five-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company went public in 2021 via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, which valued 23andMe at around $3.5 billion at the time.

23andMe's stock has mostly been in free fall in recent years as the company struggled to generate recurring revenue and stand up viable research and therapeutics businesses. As of Monday morning, the company has a market capitalization of around $25 million.",cnbc

Police said Monday that multiple ""incendiary"" devices had been placed at a Tesla showroom in Austin, Texas.

The FBI was assisting Austin Police at the showroom where a bomb squad found the devices on Monday morning.

The incident appears to be the latest targeting of a Tesla location. The electric vehicle company has faced criticism and a spate of vandalism over CEO Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration.

Musk is overseeing DOGE, the administration's effort to drastically slash federal spending and employee headcount.

The headquarters of Tesla is located in Austin.

News of the police activity broke as Musk attended a Cabinet meeting at the White House with President Donald Trump.

The Austin Police Department, in a statement, said that officers responded to the Tesla showroom just after 8 a.m. local time.

""When officers arrived on scene, they located suspicious devices, and called the APD Bomb Squad to investigate,"" the department said. ""The devices, which were determined to be incendiary, were taken into police custody without incident.""

""This is an open and ongoing investigation, and there is no further information available for release at this time,"" the department said.

Police did not say if they had any suspects.

Trump last week had suggested that people found guilty of attacking Tesla properties could serve their sentences in prisons in El Salvador.

Attorney General Pam Bondi has called the vandalism against Tesla properties, which has included an attack on vehicles with Molotov cocktails, ""domestic terrorism.",cnbc

The loss of tax receipts is expected as more individuals and businesses don't file taxes or attempt to avoid paying balances owed to the IRS. The amount of lost federal revenue could top $500 billion, the paper said.

Officials said the prediction is directly linked to shifting taxpayer behavior and President Donald Trump's cuts at the IRS, the Post said.

Thousands are expected to lose their jobs at the agency as part of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency spending reductions. Experts have warned that the cuts during tax season could materially impact filers.

The IRS has also noted increased chatter online from people saying they won't pay taxes this year or will make aggressive claims they aren't eligible for in a gamble that they won't be audited, the Post reported.

The Treasury Department told the paper the story was ""sensational and baseless"" and said the anonymous sources ""should be dismissed out of hand.""

President Donald Trump's planned round of reciprocal tariffs set to begin on April 2 may be more targeted than we thought, according to multiple media reports. While still lacking full clarity on Trump's plans, the big winners, for now, are autos and tech hardware. 2. Wall Street is poised for a sharply higher open this morning thanks to those encouraging reports on tariffs. In my Sunday column for Investing Club subscribers , I explained why I've been willing to buy stocks in the face of all the recent negativity. 3. Melius Research upgraded Boeing to buy from hold after the airplane maker won the contract to make the Pentagon's newest fighter jet. Analysts at Melius expect more positive news for Boeing ahead. I think this stock is at last turning around after that defense win. 4. Lockheed Martin , on the other hand, was downgraded by both Melius and Bank of America after losing the next-generation jet contract to Boeing. Shares are lower again this morning after dropping nearly 6% Friday. Bank of America worries the stock could be rangebound in response to the loss. 5. The gist of JPMorgan's note on Netflix : Don't sell the stock just because it has gone up so much already this year. There is more ahead. Analysts see Netflix as acting ""relatively defensively"" due to its strong engagement and the value of its subscription. I love subscription models: Not just Netflix, but also Spotify and Club names Costco and Amazon . 7. Big, big call here: Goldman Sachs downgraded server maker Super Micro to sell from hold after a 38% year-to-date rally for the stock. Analysts argued the risk/reward now looks unfavorable and cited concerns about competition and valuation. 8. Piper Sandler lowered its price target on Lowe's and Home Depot to account for pressures on big-ticket spending and tariffs. The analysts kept their overweight buy rating on both stocks, though. This is not the time to go away from home-improvement stocks. We own Home Depot for the Club and have been buying shares into weakness. 8. James Hardie Industries announced plans to buy Azek , which makes TimberTech and other outdoor building products, for $8.75 billion. The cash-and-stock deal is a bet on the U.S. housing market and a positive sign for M & A activity. James Hardie shares are getting crushed on the news. 9. A wave of price target cuts for homebuilder Lennar after its earnings report Friday. Evercore ISI also downgraded the stock to a hold-equivalent rating from outperform. Barclays, which went to $110 a share from $121, said it's worried about ""cracks"" in Lennar's fundamentals. KB Home reports tonight . 10. Citigroup lowered its price targets across the banking sector, including Club names Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo . Needless move. Bank of New York Mellon was the exception, with Citi going to $85 a share from $82. I like BNY Mellon a lot.

On Monday, the bank upgraded Viasat — a competitor of Starlink, the satellite internet service owned and operated by SpaceX — to buy from hold and upped its price target to $15 from $13. That reflects more than 53% upside from Friday's close. ""While we still have concerns about Viasat's core communication services business longer-term in the context of pressure from Starlink, we see multiple paths for the company to create equity value by materially deleveraging its balance sheet through asset monetization,"" analyst Edison Yu wrote in a note to clients. While the stock has risen about 12% in March and 15% in 2025, shares have underperformed the broader market over the past six months, falling more than 23%. That is compared to the S & P 500's six-month fall of more than 1%. VSAT 6M mountain VSAT, 6-month Yu believes there is opportunity for gains through monetizing its L-band spectrum, which he said is ""attractive due to its reliability (e.g., avoid rain fade) and versatility (cover wide area with small antenna)."" That opportunity can come in part through Ligado's recent deal with AST SpaceMobile that sees Ligado gain access to its L-band in both the U.S. and Canada, a majority of which is owned by Viasat, Yu said. ""Our rough estimate is Viasat owns at least two-thirds of the 40 MHz,"" the analyst wrote. ""Separately, Viasat owns L-band outside of US/Canada which can be used for [direct-to-device] services and is working with the European Space Agency and Space42 (UAE) to develop potential solutions."" Yu also believes there is opportunity in Viasat selling its Defense and Advanced Technologies assets. ""In a spin-off situation, our view would be DAT can command a much higher valuation on its own over time given 'Defense Tech' public comps such as Kratos and Karmin trade at materially higher multiples ( > 30x 2025E EBITDA),"" the analyst said. ""Hence, we feel quite comfortable assigning a low teens multiple to a standalone DAT entity should it get floated."" Beyond that, Yu sees the company successfully deploying the two ViaSat-3 satellites — i.e., F2 and F3 — which could remove an overhang on the stock and lead to positive free cash flow of $300 million to $500 million in 2027. Most of Wall Street is neutral on Viasat, however. While Yu's call is one of two buy ratings among analysts on the Street, seven out of nine analysts covering it have a hold rating. However, its average target of around $20 implies nearly 108% upside potential over the next several months. Following Yu's move, the stock gained nearly 5% in premarket trading on Monday.",cnbc

Google's acquisition of cybersecurity startup Wiz could be a turning point for an uncertain IPO market and a mergers and acquisitions environment aching from a slowdown in deal activity.

The search giant announced Tuesday it plans to buy the Israeli cybersecurity startup for $32 billion in its biggest acquisition ever. The deal came months after an initial $23 billion offer fell through and Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport touted plans for an initial public offering.

While deal activity has slowed from its 2021 heyday, appetite has begun to pick up.

SailPoint went public in February and CoreWeave, which sells Nvidia's AI processors, said in a Thursday filing that it plans to raise up to $2.7 billion in its IPO that's expected this week. Ticket vendor StubHub filed for an IPO on Friday.

Wiz's blockbuster deal could signal the opening of the floodgates for the IPO and M&A markets.

Cybersecurity companies look particularly poised to win as companies hunt for ways to shield their highly profitable business models. CB Insights on Tuesday said cybersecurity solutions are one of the top acquisition target areas for 2025.

""Having a more complete offering for securing workloads in the cloud — that's the core, the rationale behind [the Wiz] deal,"" said Merritt Maxim, Forrester vice president and research director.

AI driving demand for more cybersecurity

The proliferation of artificial intelligence and the transition to the cloud has amplified the need for cybersecurity solutions.

More adept hacking schemes have accelerated since OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, expediting the need for cutting-edge solutions to fend off attackers. That's made cybersecurity a key target area for companies looking to protect their business models, said Neil Barlow, partner at the law firm Clifford Chance.

""Hacks and phishing could effectively cause a business to crash,"" said Barlow, who focuses on private equity M&A. ""This is a business that is fundamental to operating, so cybersecurity has been a resilient area for quite some time.""

While megacap technology giants haven't shied away from cybersecurity investments, AI tail winds have forced companies to beef up their offerings. Google's Wiz deal could force rival Amazon to make its own acquisition, Maxim said. Potential targets include startups Aqua Security, Orca Security and Sysdig.

""The Google-Wiz tie-up does give them some capabilities that make them stronger than AWS in some areas,"" Maxim said. ""AWS could target acquisitions to potentially bring their solution closer to Google.""

What's next for the IPO market

Wiz's mammoth buyout may dampen near-term sentiment for cybersecurity startups with IPO aspirations, but experts told CNBC they anticipate a pickup in the second half of the year.

One of those contenders is malware and phishing software maker Proofpoint, which told CNBC in October that it was exploring an IPO in the next 12 to 18 months. The company went private in 2021 in a $12.3 billion acquisition by private equity firm Thoma Bravo.

Forrester's Maxim said Proofpoint and Illumio are companies ripe for IPOs in the coming months. Illumio, which offers data center and cloud security, was a member of CNBC's Disruptor 50 list in 2017 and 2018.

Netskope, which also offers cloud security, is another company being closely watched for an IPO, said Brianne Lynch, head of market insight at EquityZen. Netskope told The Wall Street Journal last year that it was planning an IPO in 2025. The company may start to feel pressure from early investors hunting for liquidity 13 years after its founding, Lynch said.

Snyk, a cybersecurity startup founded about a decade ago, has also alluded to a public offering next year. The company was last valued at $7.4 billion and CEO Peter McKay said in a post last year that Snyk had crossed $300 million in annual recurring revenue.

The big question is whether now is the rip-the-bandage-off moment for companies that decide to go public or whether market volatility will cause companies to once again kick the can down the road, Lynch said.",cnbc

Shares of the satellite communications giant and competitor to Starlink – the satellite internet service owned and operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX – jumped more than 13% in afternoon trading after analyst Edison Yu upgraded the stock to buy from hold .

To be sure, Yu noted that he still has concerns regarding pressure from Starlink on Viasat's core communication services business in the longer term. Starlink has recently made moves over the past year to expand its presence in various countries.

Earlier this month, Musk secured deals with Indian telecommunications companies Reliance's Jio and Bharti Airtel to roll out Starlink's internet services across the country. Prior to that, Musk also launched Starlink satellite internet services in Indonesia in May 2024.

Yu's bullish call comes as Viasat shares have already grown substantially in 2025. Year to date, the stock has risen roughly 30%, far outpacing the S&P 500, which is off more than 2% in that period. In this month alone, the stock has advanced more than 25%.

Additionally, Fed officials raised their outlook for core inflation to 2.8%, well above the central bank's 2% goal, though they still expect to achieve that level by 2027.

Still, Powell and his colleagues at the two-day policy meeting that concluded Wednesday lowered their estimate for gross domestic product this year to just a 1.7% annualized gain. Excluding the Covid-induced retrenchment in 2020, that would be the worst growth rate since 2011.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week acknowledged the worries but said he still sees the economy as ""strong overall"" featuring ""significant progress toward our goals over the past two years.""

Though unemployment remains low and most data points suggest continued if slowing growth, the survey results reinforce the message from sentiment surveys that consumers and business leaders are increasingly concerned that a slowdown or recession is a growing risk.

The probability of a downturn in growth over the next 12 months is about 43%, as set by the average view of 400 respondents during the period of March 17-20.

Chances that the U.S. is heading for a recession are close to 50-50, according to a Deutsche Bank survey that raises more questions about the direction of the U.S. economy.

The combination of higher inflation and slower growth raise the specter of stagflation, a phenomenon not experienced since the early 1980s. Few economists see that era replicated in the current environment, though the probability is rising of a policy challenge where the Fed might have to choose between boosting growth and tamping down prices.

Markets have been nervous in recent weeks about the prospects ahead. Bond expert Jeffrey Gundlach at DoubleLine Capital told CNBC a few days ago that he sees the chances of a recession at 50%-60%.

""The recent equity market correction was punctuated by the 'uncertainty shock' of ever-evolving tariff policy, with investors concerned it could morph into a slowdown or even recession,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note Monday. ""What's really at the heart of the conundrum, however, is that the U.S. might be at risk for a bout of stagflation, where growth slows and inflation remains sticky.""

Powell, though, doubted that a repeat of the previous bout of stagnation is in the cards. ""I wouldn't say we're in a situation that's remotely comparable to that is likely,"" he said.

Barclays analysts noted that ""market-based measures are consistent with only a modest slowing in the economy,"" though the firm expects a growth rate this year of just 0.7%, barely above the recession threshold.

UCLA Anderson, a closely-watched and widely-cited forecasting center, recently turned heads with its first-ever ""recession watch"" call for the economy, based largely on concerns over President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Clement Bohr, an economist at the school, wrote that the downturn could come in a year or two though he said one is ""entirely avoidable"" should Trump scale back his tariff threats.

""This Watch also serves as a warning to the current administration: be careful what you wish for because, if all your wishes come true, you could very well be the author of a deep recession. And it may not simply be a standard recession that is being chaperoned into existence, but a stagflation,"" Bohr said.

Business interests, from U.S. farmers to global ocean carriers, are warning of severe economic damage from proposals being considered by the U.S. government to hit containerships made in China with steep fines when they call on U.S. ports. The goal of bringing more shipbuilding back to the U.S. is at odds with reality in the global ocean trade market, they say, where virtually all container traffic will soon be carried on ships built in China.

An estimated 98% of the global fleet would be subjected to fees when calling on U.S. ports because the fee applies to both existing Chinese-built vessels or future vessels in the order book of carriers, and any carrier with at least one order on the books for a vessel made in China, according to the World Shipping Council, which represents the international ocean liner shipping industry. Currently, 90% of the world's vessels are subjected to the fee. According to Sea-Intelligence, the total number of port calls made by deep-sea container liner vessels in the United States in 2024 was 12,410.

On Monday, a hearing was being held by the U.S. Trade Representative to consider the implementation of penalties. The investigation, begun under President Joe Biden, culminated in a report released in January that concluded China's shipbuilding and maritime industry had an unfair advantage. Now, it is being continued by the Trump administration as part of the president's widening global economic and trade war, with Trump saying in his recent speech to Congress that he will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House that would offer special tax incentives to bring more shipbuilding back to the U.S.

""The nation's agriculture exporters are united in concern and opposition to the proposal,"" Peter Friedmann, executive director of the Agriculture Transportation Coalition, said in prepared testimony ahead of the hearing. ""We are not opposed to the objective, but we are not willing to sacrifice America's agriculture and the communities throughout the country that would be economically distressed or worse, by a plan such as the present, that would eliminate our ability to sell agriculture outside our own borders.""

The AgTC says there are no U.S.-built vessels suitable for international commercial shipping that exist today that can move agricultural cargo, moved by container ships, bulk ships, and breakbulk ships, and across products that include corn, wheat, grains, and soybeans. ""If they were available at a reasonable cost, U.S. exporters, including agriculture, would already be using this option,"" Friedmann said in his testimony.

The razor-thin margins that farmers face in the world economy, and the increased and intense competition for bulk commodities, have to be factored into vessel choices for transport of commodities, he said.

To penalize ocean carriers using Chinese-made vessels to move trade, the U.S. government has proposed steep levies on Chinese-made ships arriving at U.S. ports. For Chinese-owned operators (such as COSCO), a service fee of up to $1 million could be charged on each vessel. For non-Chinese-owned ocean carriers with fleets containing Chinese-built vessels, the service fee would be up to $1.5 million for each U.S. port of call.",cnbc

Patients, doctors and investors will soon learn a lot more about a new, more convenient treatment that could shake up the booming weight loss drug market. Eli Lilly plans to release initial results from several late-stage clinical trials on its experimental once-daily obesity pill, orforglipron, this year. The company has said it expects to unveil data from five studies in patients with Type 2 diabetes and two trials in people with obesity in 2025. Analysts expect the pill to be as effective, safe and tolerable to take as Novo Nordisk 's semaglutide – the active ingredient in its popular but costly weight loss injection Wegovy and diabetes drug Ozempic. The trial results are among the pharmaceutical industry's most critical and closely watched of the year, as they bring Eli Lilly's drug one step closer to becoming a new, needle-free alternative for weight loss and diabetes. ""This could join a growing toolbox of medications for obesity, and it could be a game-changer,"" said Dr. Eduardo Grunvald, medical director for UC San Diego's Center for Advanced Weight Management. If it enters the market, orforglipron could help more patients access the treatments and alleviate the supply shortfalls of the injections on the market. The pill could also help Eli Lilly solidify its dominance in the growing segment as a slate of other drugmakers race to bring a product to the market. Offering the first oral version of a so-called GLP-1 could help Eli Lilly capture an even greater share of the market for that popular class of weight loss and diabetes drugs. Eli Lilly is currently about three years ahead of other drugmakers developing pills, including Pfizer , AstraZeneca , Roche , Structure Therapeutics and Viking Therapeutics , Guggenheim analyst Seamus Fernandez told CNBC. Some analysts expect the market for GLP-1s to be worth more than $150 billion annually by the early 2030s. Oral GLP-1s could grow to be worth $50 billion of that total, Fernandez said. In a statement, Eli Lilly said it is ""investigating orforglipron for the potential to bring a safe and effective treatment to people with these diseases who are looking for a convenient, oral option."" Eli Lilly's pill works in a similar way to Wegovy, Ozempic, and Novo Nordisk's diabetes pill Rybelsus, targeting a gut hormone called GLP-1 to suppress a person's appetite and regulate blood sugar. But unlike those three medications, Eli Lilly's pill is not a peptide medication. That means it is absorbed more easily in the body and doesn't require dietary restrictions like Rybelsus does. It is unclear whether orforglipron will have a hefty list price similar to those of the injections, which cost roughly $1,000 per month, or whether it will help expand insurance coverage for obesity treatments. Medicare and many employer-based plans still don't cover those drugs. But so-called small molecule pills will at least be easier for Eli Lilly to manufacture than injections. In January, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said the pill could receive U.S. regulatory approval as soon as early 2026. The company also said in its annual report in February it recorded a nearly $550 million ""pre-launch inventory"" charge for oforglipron, meaning it is preparing to manufacture the drug even before its approval. ""That's a good indicator that they are comfortable with what they're seeing across the trials,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman told CNBC. Eli Lilly has benefitted from the windfall from tirzepatide – the active ingredient in its weight loss injection Zepbound and diabetes shot Mounjaro – which targets GLP-1 but also activates another gut hormone called GIP. Fueled by those treatments, Eli Lilly has become the largest global pharmaceutical and health-care company by market cap, with a market value of about $814 billion as of Monday. The company raked in more than $45 billion in revenue in 2024 alone, a significant share of which came from its portfolio of diabetes and obesity products.

Who could benefit from the pill

While injections will likely remain a popular option, a once-daily pill like Eli Lilly's could be much easier for some patients to take and store. ""What we're going to see over the next couple of years is that we're moving away from one-size-fits-all products to more customized products that are more directly aligned to the profile of the patient,"" Seigerman said. Patients can inject Zepbound and Wegovy under their skin with a click of a button, but must follow specific instructions, such as storing the shots at certain temperatures and injecting in a different spot each week. Meanwhile, Rybelsus must be taken in the morning on an empty stomach with no more than four ounces of plain water.

Orforglipron does not have dietary restrictions, and will also offer an option for patients who could benefit from treatment but are afraid of needles. Th pill could also tap into new markets in countries that don't have the resources for the cold supply chains needed to store and administer GLP-1 injections, Guggenheim's Fernandez said. People who lost weight on the injections and are tired of taking a shot every week could also be ""good candidates"" to switch to a pill and take them as maintenance doses, which are meant to be taken long term to prolong the effects of a drug, Seigerman added. Eli Lilly is studying orforglipron as a maintenance dose in patients who took tirzepatide throughout a phase three trial called SURMOUNT-5, with results expected in early 2026. Still, some patients who don't mind taking injections may continue their current treatment regimen, UCSD's Grunvald noted. He said some people already take several pills for other conditions each day, so they may prefer to take an injection once a week ""and forget about it rather than adding another pill."" Eli Lilly's pill could also be more fit for people who are overweight or ""modestly obese,"" said Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger. Those who have a very high body mass index will ""best be treated with injectables that offer greater efficacy,"" Risinger said. While orforglipron is expected to be as good for weight loss as Wegovy, Zepbound, on average, is more effective at helping patients lose weight than Novo Nordisk's injection, according to real-world data and a head-to-head trial on the drugs.

A pill is a welcome alternative for patients like Willow Baillies, 29, who has been injecting herself with cheaper, compounded versions of Zepbound because her insurance does not cover the branded medication. The Food and Drug Administration, in most cases, now bars compounding pharmacies from making those unapproved versions because it declared the Zepbound shortage over in December. Baillies, a human resources specialist based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, said a pill would ""offer peace of mind because I don't have to think much about taking it."" Currently, her injections require careful preparation, such as disinfecting her entire counter with alcohol pads. Orforglipron's entrance into the market could also help the weight loss drug market reach more patients in the primary care setting who are not currently receiving treatment but could benefit from it, Seigerman said. While some primary care doctors can and do prescribe GLP-1s, others are hesitant due to concerns about side effects and administration since they are injections. He said the primary care part of the market is key for the weight loss drug market to hit Wall Street's lofty forecasts.

Accessibility, pricing and insurance

Still, Seigerman said he believes primary care providers who prescribe pills may still encounter issues with pricing and insurance coverage. He said he doesn't expect orforglipron to cost significantly less than existing injections because pharmaceutical products are ""typically priced by the value that they bring, regardless of the route of administration."" For example, Rybelsus costs about $997 a month before insurance, the same list price as Ozempic. Risinger said he expects orforglipron to be priced at a slight discount to Zepbound, which means Eli Lilly's pill could cost significantly less than Wegovy. The list price of Wegovy – nearly $1,350 per month – is already around a 20% premium to Zepbound's list price of just under $1,100 per month, he said. That means if the pill costs 10% to 15% less than Zepbound, it would be almost a 30% to 35% discount compared to Wegovy, according to Risinger. But Risinger said he does not necessarily expect the pill to lead to better insurance coverage for obesity medications. He believes orforglipron will be covered by some plans like Zepbound is, but certain employers will likely still fear that some patients are only using obesity drugs for cosmetic purposes. Other employers are still balking at the high costs associated with covering those treatments. Jill Skala, a teacher in western Pennsylvania, said she would ""definitely consider"" taking a pill if it was less expensive than Zepbound and had ""equal efficacy or better."" Skala, 49 is currently taking Zepbound and also has a nine-month supply of compounded tirzepatide, which she expects to use until the end of the year. ""I would probably just stay with Zepbound if [the pill] wasn't significantly less expensive, as long as Zepbound was still working for me,"" Skala told CNBC.

Trial data expectations

Several analysts said they expect Eli Lilly's pill to be as effective or slightly less than injectable semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, in phase three trials. In patients with obesity, that implies weight loss of around 13% to 15%, according to a February note from JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott. That is in line with or slightly below Wegovy's 15% average weight loss in phase three trials. Eli Lilly's phase two trial examined different doses of the pill in overweight or obese patients, with a highest dose of 45 milligrams. But the company is only giving doses of up to 36 milligrams in phase three trials on orforglipron. Overweight or obese patients who took 36 milligrams of the pill once a day lost 13.5% of their body weight on average after 36 weeks in Eli Lilly's phase two trial. That compares with an average weight loss of 2.3% for people who received a placebo. Eli Lilly expects weight loss in people with diabetes to be ""significantly less"" than patients with obesity who don't have diabetes, the company's Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Skovronsky said on an earnings call in February. That's based on prior studies on orforglipron and other GLP-1 therapies, he noted. Schott said weight loss among diabetes patients could come in between 6% to 8%. He also expects hemoglobin A1c – a blood test that measures the average blood sugar level over the past two to three months – to improve by 1.8 to 2.1 points. That would be in line with results seen in diabetes patients who took Ozempic. In a phase two trial, orforglipron led to an HbA1c reduction of up to 2.1% at 26 weeks in adults with diabetes, compared to a decrease of 0.4% among those who took a placebo.

However, how well patients tolerate Eli Lilly's pill – specifically the rate of gastrointestinal side effects in the trial – will be the ""key focus"" of the phase three study results, according to Schott. It's an issue top of mind for doctors, patients and investors because side effects such as nausea and vomiting are a significant reason why some people stop taking the injections. Schott said the bar for orforglipron is nausea rates of less than 25% and vomiting rates in the low double digits for diabetes patients. He expects orforglipron to cause slightly worse rates of gastrointestinal side effects in patients with obesity. That could lead to ""tolerability worse than Zepbound but closer to Wegovy,"" Schott added. Orforglipron's nausea and vomiting rates in the phase two trial were ""meaningfully greater"" than those among patients who took 2-milligram doses of semaglutide in a phase three trial, Leerink's Risinger said. But he expects patients to tolerate Eli Lilly's pill better in phase three trials because they are longer in duration than the mid-stage studies and likely involve slower titration. That refers to how quickly patients start at a lower dose of a drug and ramp up to a higher target dose. On safety, Schott said he expects a ""very low probability"" of any issues that could put the entire development program for orforglipron at risk. He also believes it is highly unlikely that there will be any concerns related to liver toxicity – an issue that derailed one of Pfizer's experimental obesity pills.

What the pill means for competitors

Positive data on the pill and a potential approval would be a boon to Eli Lilly, but could also be good news for other companies developing oral GLP-1s, according to some analysts. Orforglipron's success could ""validate"" that administering a GLP-1 orally is possible, BMO's Seigerman said.",cnbc

https://cnbc.com,OpenAI expands COO Brad Lightcap's job to include oversight of business,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/24/openai-expands-coo-brad-lightcaps-job-to-include-business-oversight-.html,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on Monday that Brad Lightcap, the company's chief operating officer, is expanding his role to oversee ""business and day-to-day operations.""

Lightcap, who joined the company in 2018 and previously worked with CEO Sam Altman at Y Combinator, is leading ""global deployment,"" focusing on strategy, partnerships and infrastructure, OpenAI said in a blog post.

Altman is handing over a public-facing position to Lightcap as the company's pressures intensify. As of last month, OpenAI was closing in on a $260 billion valuation, with a $40 billion investment by SoftBank. Part of the funding is expected to be used for OpenAI's commitment to Stargate, a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle that was announced by President Donald Trump in January. The plan calls for billions of dollars to be invested in U.S. artificial intelligence infrastructure.

In addition to Lighcap's growing responsibilities, OpenAI said that Mark Chen, a six-year veteran of the company is taking on the expanded role of chief research officer, though Chen's LinkedIn profile indicates he's had the job since January. The post also said that Julia Villagra is now chief people officer, a job her LinkedIn profile says she's had since June 2024.

Altman said in the post that part of Villagra's job is to ""ensure that OpenAI remains the top destination for people who want to build"" artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which broadly refers to AI that is as smart or smarter than humans.

OpenAI faces intense competition in generative AI from other high-valued startups like Anthropic as well as tech giants including Alphabet and Microsoft , which has been the company's top backer and key strategic partner.

OpenAI is also in a heated legal and public relations battle with Elon Musk, who controls rival startup xAI and is a central advisor to the Trump administration, with a potential to influence regulations in ways that favor his businesses. Musk was among OpenAI's co-founders, when it was a nonprofit research lab, before having a public split with the company and Altman.

Meanwhile, Altman has been dealing with instability in the company's top ranks as OpenAI seeks to become a for-profit entity. In 2024, Mira Murati, who had been CTO, announced her departure from the company after six and a half years. That same day, research chief Bob McGrew and Barret Zoph, a research vice president, also announced their departures. Murati went on to form her own competing AI startup, Thinking Machines, with a founding team of some ex-OpenAI employees.

Bitcoin's correlation with the Nasdaq is currently at about 0.5, after it approached 0.8 earlier this year, according to the bank. Meanwhile, its correlation with gold has been falling since January, touching zero at one point, and is now just above 0.2. ""Bitcoin trading is highly correlated to the Nasdaq over short time horizons,"" Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered's global head of digital assets research, said in a note Monday. ""This Nasdaq correlation leads to the idea that bitcoin could be included in a basket of large tech stocks; if it were included, the implication would be more institutional buying as BTC would serve multiple purposes in investor portfolios."" Bitcoin is frequently viewed as ""digital gold"" and a hedge against risks facing the traditional financial sector. Kendrick said he still sees the flagship cryptocurrency serving that purpose but that ""in reality … the need for such hedges is very infrequent."" Standard Chartered created a hypothetical index dubbed ""Mag 7B,"" in which it added bitcoin to the Magnificent 7 tech stocks – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla – and removed Tesla. ""Mag 7B has outperformed Mag 7 by about 5% over the period since December 2017,"" he said. ""On a calendar year basis, Mag 7B outperformed Mag 7 in five out of seven years, albeit by a very small margin in 2022. Mag 7B's relative returns are decent on both an absolute basis (averaging around 1% a year above Mag 7) and a calendar-year basis."" Kendrick said bitcoin has been trading in a similar volatility-adjusted fashion to Nvidia since President Trump's inauguration. They're down 16% and 12%, respectively, since Jan. 20. Meanwhile, Tesla, which has lost 36% in the same period, is trading more like ether (down 38% since Jan. 20). ""Investors can view bitcoin as both a hedge against [traditional finance] and as part of their tech allocation,"" Kendrick said. ""Indeed, as BTC's role in global investor portfolios becomes established, we think that having more than one use will bring fresh capital inflows to the asset. This is particularly true as bitcoin investment becomes more institutionalized."" Bitcoin is down about 5% for the year after Trump's tariff threats in recent weeks have brought new volatility to the market. Investors are expecting relief in the second quarter, however, given bitcoin's two of its most persistent correlations : its positive correlation with money supply growth, also known as M2, and its negative correlation with the U.S. dollar index, or DXY . —CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.

https://cnbc.com,How to trade this retailer using options ahead of earnings this week,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/24/how-to-trade-this-retailer-using-options-ahead-of-earnings-this-week.html,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Last October, I highlighted a pair trading opportunity. Long Lululemon (LULU) uses a long call spread, the March 28th weekly $280/$330 call spread, and short Nike (NKE) uses a March 28th $85/$70 put spread. Since that time, LULU has risen nearly 8%, and Nike has fallen roughly 14%. The LULU call spread is close to the maximum achievable profit (the short $330 strike is slightly over 2% out of the money), and the Nike spread has reached the peak achievable profit as the stock is now almost 3% below the lower strike for the put spread. Take profits and close both spreads in the pairs trade now. This is particularly important in the case of Lululemon because while Nike has reported — and the stock fell to lows not seen since 2020 — LULU will be reporting earnings on Thursday. The options market implies that LULU shares could move 10%, higher or lower, by the end of the week between $290 and $355. Most of the potential profits in the call spread have already been made. Why take a risk without potential reward? The question then is what to do now. Nike's earnings results illustrate that CEO Elliott Hill has his work cut out, turning around the athletic apparel and shoe company. While more sell-side analysts have a ""buy"" or ""outperform"" rating than a hold or a sell, several analysts reduced their price targets recently. The current average is 83.50, ~30% lower than a year ago. Lululemon's average price target has also fallen since March 2024. At its highs, it was ~$500 but is now just over $400. What I like about LULU is that Lululemon customers typically represent household incomes of $75,000-$300,000+ and an age range of 15-45, with a sweet spot at 25-34. Affluence and youth combined with a near cult-like loyalty, YoY anticipated sales and earnings growth of > 7%, and forward earnings multiple of less than 21x FY2026 earnings (for the FYE January 31st, 2026) is a very reasonable valuation. That said, Placer.ai data suggests YoY foot traffic is down 7.6% from February to the end of February. Placer.ai generates U.S. foot traffic estimates for retail stores by leveraging a sophisticated combination of mobile location data, advanced data science, and machine learning techniques. Placer.ai starts with a panel of tens of millions of mobile devices across the U.S. (reportedly around 30 million as of earlier statements). This panel is built by aggregating anonymized location data from smartphone apps with user consent to share geolocation information via software development kits (SDKs). These apps span various categories (e.g., weather, gaming, shopping), ensuring a broad population sample. A proprietary catalog of retail store locations, updated with details like store size and type, possibly supplemented by public records or partnerships. LULU 1Y mountain Lululemon, 1-year In fairness, some alternative data contradict this negative assessment. For example, Bloomberg's ""Second Measure"" data estimates observed sales are 3.2% higher YoY (well above the -8.2% YoY sales decline they estimate for the industry more broadly). However, 3.2% is well below the growth of prior years or the broad market. The trade I would, therefore, be more confident picking up LULU shares at a discount to where they're trading now - closer to the prices where LULU was trading back when I recommended it last October. One way to profit from a modest pullback, with the worst-case risk that one buys the shares at a net price of ~ $265, would be by using a zero-cost 1x2 put spread. I was looking at the May 2 weekly $315/$290 1x2 put spread, buying one May $315 put and selling two May $290 puts. Because the May 290s are half the price of the 315s, by selling two of them, the net cost of the trade is essentially zero as/of Friday's closing prices. Even if LULU falls modestly post-earnings, this trade could profit. Of course, if it falls sharply below $290 one would be compelled to purchase the shares at the strike, but because one would realize $25 in profits from the move between $315 and $290, the effective purchase price would be $265 or roughly the lows of Early October 2024. If the shares rally post-earnings, because there was no net outlay of premium, no harm no foul.

https://cnbc.com,"Tesla rebounds 10% for biggest gain since its post-Election Day pop, following 9-straight weeks of losses",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/24/tesla-rebounds-10percent-for-biggest-pop-of-the-year-following-9-straight-weeks-of-losses.html,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Shares were last up more than 10%. The stock is on pace for its best day since Nov. 6, 2024 — the day following President Donald Trump's victory in the election — making it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for the day. Nonetheless, shares are still trading more than 44% below their all-time high from December.

Tesla shares are headed for their best day in 2025 after falling for nine consecutive weeks due to rising controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk 's political activities.

The stock has sold off heavily over the last few months amid rising consumer boycotts and plummeting demand globally due to Musk's rise as a right-wing political figure. There have been multiple incidents of vandalism and arson across Tesla showrooms and charging stations in the U.S. and Europe.

Morgan Stanley recently cited this trend as it slashed its first-quarter delivery estimates. It now predicts a decline of 9% year over year, due to negative brand sentiment and more intense competition.

Tesla shares also benefited from an uptick in broader market sentiment Monday, after the Wall Street Journal reported Trump's reciprocal tariffs starting April 2 may be more targeted than previously expected. Tariffs on industrial sectors are now unlikely to be announced then, the report stated. Certain nations may also be excluded from the tariffs, according to a separate report from Bloomberg. To be sure, both the WSJ and Bloomberg reports noted that the situation remains fluid and the plans could change.

Musk recently addressed the heavy sell-off to Tesla employees. At an all-hands meeting last Thursday evening, Musk told employees to ""hang onto your stock."" He also stated the company's signature Model Y would be the ""best-selling car on Earth again this year.""

Correction: Morgan Stanley predicts Tesla first-quarter deliveries will fall more than 9% from the prior year. An earlier version of this story misstated the estimate.

The megacap tech stock and retail investor favorite is coming off nine straight down weeks, its longest ever weekly decline. AZEK — The outdoor products maker rallied 12% after Australia's James Hardie Industries agreed to acquire it for about $9 billion in cash and stock . James Hardie, a cement maker, tumbled more than 19%. Visa — The credit card stock rose 2.2% after Coinbase reported that World Network, the crypto firm run by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, is in talks with Visa for a stablecoin wallet. Pinterest — The social media platform added 6% after Guggenheim upgraded its investment opinion to buy from neutral. Analyst Michael Morris said a recent pullback has opened up an attractive entry point for investors, adding that user base monetization should grow at above-market rates in the next two years. ViaSat — The satellite stock rallied about 10% on the back of Deutsche Bank's upgrade to buy from hold. The bank said ViaSat, which competes with Elon Musk's Starlink, has ""multiple paths"" to create equity value. Steel Dynamics , Nucor — Shares of Steel Dynamics and Nucor rose more than 3% and nearly 5%, respectively, after UBS upgraded the steel producers to buy from neutral. Analyst Andrew Jones said tariff protection for U.S. steel and aluminum has helped lead to higher prices, and sees President Donald Trump's tariffs as having created an attractive entry point for investors. Commercial Metals climbed more than 5% in sympathy. 23andMe — The DNA testing company collapsed 49% after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in federal court. Co-founder Anne Wojcicki resigned as CEO effective immediately. Lockheed Martin — The defense contractor lost more than 2%, extending losses from Friday, in the aftermath of losing the next-generation fighter jet contract with the U.S. Air Force to competitor Boeing. Bank of America downgraded LMT on Monday, saying shares will likely remain rangebound following the contract award. Boeing — The aircraft maker saw shares rise more than 2% after Wall Street research firm Melius upgraded it to buy from neutral. Melius cited ""an operationally focused CEO,"" a faster-than-expected post-strike 737 increase in deliveries and the win over Lockheed on the Air Force's next gen fighter program as catalysts. FedEx — The package delivery company rose 5% following an upgrade at Jefferies to buy from hold. The firm believes investors are ignoring an ""idiosyncratic cost transformation"" going on under the surface at FedEx. Super Micro Computer — The tech hardware stock fell 2% on the heels of a Goldman Sachs downgrade to sell from neutral. After a rally this year, the firm said Super Micro has downside risks tied to valuation, competition and profit margins. Generac — The generator maker advanced more than 4% after Bank of America reinstated coverage at a buy. The bank said Generac can benefit from the rising number of natural disasters and from aging baby boomers' need for reliable power for medications and medical devices. — CNBC's Michelle Fox, Lisa Kailai Han, Sean Conlon, Yun Li and Hakyung Kim contributed reporting.

Stocks surged Monday to kick off the trading week, with the major averages all up more than 1%, following reports that President Donald Trump could take a softer stance on tariffs . This comes after the S & P 500 on Friday snapped a four-week losing streak , posting a 0.5% weekly advance. But technicians are watching key levels to see if the rally is sustainable, or if it represents just a temporary bit of relief after the pullback over the last month, during which the S & P 500 dipped into correction territory . .SPX 1M mountain S & P 500 ""If this bounce is more than a simple oversold move, we should expect the S & P 500 to retain 5,825,"" JC O'Hara, chief market technician at Roth Capital Partners, wrote Sunday. ""The first move which should be celebrated by the bulls is a successful close above 5,700 as that is the level where sellers have become very aggressive. The ability to break above that line will be a partial indication of seller's exhaustion."" A move to 5,825 would be a 2.8% advance above where the S & P 500 closed Friday, at 5,667.56. A close above 5,700 would be a less than 1% gain. On Monday, the S & P 500 was at 5,762 at noon. Similarly, Oppenheimer's Ari Wald said he's waiting for the S & P 500 to reclaim resistance at 5,750, which also represents the 200-day moving average for the benchmark. He noted 5,500 is a critical support level for the broader index, while resistance is more ""formidable"" at 5,900, which also represents the 50-day moving average. In fact, he noted that risk leadership, in particular, is oversold, meaning this is an area where investors can add exposure. ""In regards to attractive tactical conditions for risk, the High-Beta vs. Low-Volatility ratio is trading 10% below its 200-day average,"" Wald said. ""While we believe longer-term leadership trends are reversing toward low-volatility defensives, this oversold deviation indicates current conditions are unfavorable for risk-off, and conversely, favorable for risk-on."" Other technicians expressed more skepticism stocks could meaningfully break out from here. BTIG's Jonathan Krinsky said he anticipates a ""tactical bounce, but medium-term trouble"" for stocks. Elsewhere, Wolfe Research's Rob Ginsberg said it's critical for the current stock rally to show it has some legs. ""This past week was disappointing, as the S & P was unable to punch above 5700, try as it might,"" Ginsberg wrote over the weekend. ""If upside momentum fails to gain traction in the coming week, this powerful rally so many are banking on, may be a lost cause."" Get Your Ticket to Pro LIVE Join us at the New York Stock Exchange!
