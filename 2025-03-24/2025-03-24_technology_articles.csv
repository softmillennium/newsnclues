https://techmeme.com,AI creation platform Arcade expands from jewelry to home goods,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/24/ai-creation-platform-arcade-expands-from-jewelry-to-home-goods/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Arcade, a generative AI marketplace for designing jewelry, is expanding its offerings to include home goods, starting with rugs.

The company on Monday also introduced a new feature called “Match My Room,” which allows users to upload a photo of their room so their design complements the existing colors and style.

Alongside this expansion, Arcade announced its $25 million Series A funding round, bringing the total amount raised to $42 million.

Similar to Arcade’s jewelry design generator, the rug creation tool leverages Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. Users select the rug material and then enter a text prompt to describe the desired design. Once the design is generated, it’s then paired with a manufacturer, who will send the creator a free sample for approval before purchasing.

Based on our testing, rugs start at around $400 for a 3×9 hand-tufted wool option, which is the most affordable material. Prices increase for higher-end materials such as cashmere, alpaca, and mohair. However, Arcade claims to offer more affordable options than luxury rug retailers that charge thousands of dollars.

The “Match My Room” feature allows users to upload a photo of their space. While the AI analyzes color matching, it can’t successfully replicate patterns from other decor items in the image, like pillows and blankets. Overall, though, it’s a useful tool for ensuring the rug’s color accents tie in with other furniture.

For users looking to create designs for pure enjoyment, Arcade offers “Dream Boards,” which function similarly to Pinterest boards, showcasing products with similar themes, such as Hollywood-inspired earrings. Users can also browse other Dream Boards and make purchases.

Additionally, Arcade has a seller program, allowing people to earn a 5% commission for each sale of their product, an increase from the previous 2.5%. Users can earn even more by joining Arcade’s affiliate program.

The company recently launched a new entrepreneur program aimed at helping content creators unlock higher commission rates. Major media outlets and influencers with over 25,000 followers are encouraged to sign up by emailing Arcade’s marketing team.

Despite launching its beta jewelry offering only in September 2024, Arcade claims to have generated 650,000 jewelry designs. But the company didn’t disclose how many users are interested in purchasing these designs, nor has it revealed the commission earnings of sellers.

Arcade is spearheaded by Mariam Naficy, who previously founded cosmetics retailer Eve and design marketplace Minted.

The Series A round was led by Laura Chau (Canaan Partners), with participation from Kirsten Green (Forerunner).

The new capital will be allocated toward hiring, platform development, and introducing new product categories like ceramics and pillows. Naficy has previously mentioned to TechCrunch that additional categories may include apparel and leather goods. According to its website, chain belts are also next.

Arcade previously raised $17 million from Ashton Kutcher (Sound Ventures), Offline Ventures, and Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn co-founder). Other investors include Inspired Capital, Torch Capital, and David Luan, CEO of Adept AI Labs and former vice president of engineering at OpenAI, among others.",techmeme
https://techmeme.com,X’s head of engineering is out,https://www.theverge.com/twitter/634833/x-head-engineering-leaves-elon-musk,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 19:32:25 GMT","is a senior AI reporter working with The Verge’s policy and tech teams. She previously worked at Fortune Magazine and Business Insider.

X’s director of engineering, Haofei Wang, has suddenly left the company, according to sources with knowledge of the matter.

Wang first joined Elon Musk’s X in July 2023 and has been an integral part of the company’s leadership, often serving as a conduit between Musk and the rest of the company’s engineers. More recently, he was seen internally as X’s defacto head of engineering and product, especially with Musk recently focusing more of his time on xAI and DOGE. It’s unclear why Wang is departing now. Neither he nor a company spokesperson responded to a request for comment in time for publication.

X recently added other engineering leadership: Mike Dalton and Uday Ruddaraju, both previously technical leads at Robinhood, joined in January. Their LinkedIn profiles show that they also work at xAI, which has become increasingly intertwined with X over the last year.

Do you work at X or xAI? I’d love to chat. You can reach me securely on Signal @kylie.01 or via email at kylie@theverge.com.

Thanks to the growing profile of xAI and Musk’s newfound political influence, X’s business appears to be turning around. The company reportedly just obtained a $44 billion valuation from investors — the same price Musk paid for Twitter in 2022. While Musk remains an avid poster on X, his attention and leadership at X has become increasingly split since he started campaigning for President Donald Trump last summer.",techmeme
https://techmeme.com,Fair-code pioneer n8n raises $60M for AI-powered workflow automation,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/24/fair-code-pioneer-n8n-raises-60m-for-ai-powered-workflow-automation/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Developer tooling is changing rapidly with AI. So companies that are making it easier to adopt AI in their workflows are seeing a boom of attention. After a startup called n8n (pronounced “enay-ten”) pivoted its workflow automation platform to become more AI-friendly in 2022, it said it saw its revenues increase 5X, doubling in the last two months alone.

Now on the back of that growth, TechCrunch has confirmed that n8n has raised €55 million ($60 million) in funding on a valuation sources close to the company tell us is in the region of €250 million ($270 million).

Berlin-based n8n said it now has more than 3,000 enterprise customers and around 200,000 active users on its books. The startup will be using this Series B to continue investing in tech and to expand in newer markets like the U.S., home to more than half of n8n’s user base. The company does not disclose revenues, and that customer number includes both free and paying users, as well as those taking short-term and longer-term subscriptions.

Highland Europe is leading this latest round, with HV Capital and previous backers Sequoia, Felicis, and Harpoon also participating. Sequoia led the seed round for n8n in 2020; Felicis the Series A in 2021.

The startup, founded in 2019, picked up traction in its early years from developer teams that were looking for low-code and no-code automation solutions to make it easier to stitch applications together in ways without a lot of onerous coding.

It picked up attention for another reason, too: n8n had built a reputation by being closely tied to the concept of “fair code.”

Fair code is a progression of open source. Software developers use open source code for free, but when they want to commercialize work built on top of it, it establishes principles for compensating the open source creators or community. Jan Oberhauser, the founder and CEO of n8n, came up with the idea and runs a site dedicated to fair code.

But while n8n itself is built on fair code and leans into the open source community to grow by word of mouth — it has more than 70,000 “stars” on GitHub — the company says that it was weaving in AI that became its rocket ship.

AI, and in particular generative AI, is a clear complement to automation — something that close competitors like Tines and Workato have also embraced, as have others in the wider automation world like UiPath.

If automation and low-code approaches have erased some of the busy work of pulling together how different apps or services worked together, generative AI brings even less technicality into the mix.

A year and a half ago, Oberhauser said, “we could see this AI thing coming at us.” He quickly surmised that the sweet spot would be to work it into its products, to start to reduce the amount of work it took developers to implement automations by turning instructions into natural language.

“It’s a prompt to build workflow,” is how Oberhauser describes it. “People don’t really need to write 50 lines of code to integrate the functionality of, say, sending an email.” Now in natural language, you can write “get information from X and send it to Y,” he said. “We see the value in making changes to that more easily.”

The product was built with a blend of LLMs in mind, and the idea is that if end users are already building services using one LLM or another, it can be swapped in to work with n8n’s platform. And like a number of other developer-focused platforms, n8n has a fairly extensive contributor community that is active on platforms like GitHub, gets involved in forums to help other developers with their questions, and builds and uses workflow templates built by others (n8n also has pre-built a number of workflow templates).

Even with all the hype and hope around artificial intelligence and GenAI these days, the AI-powered version of n8n took a while to stick, with virtually no take-up at all at first. Then last year, there was a sudden a tipping point.

Why? Perhaps the weight of a couple of trends coming together. There was the burst of chatter around AI in coding, with companies like Poolside, Codeium, and Magic all raising big money within months of each other. And then within end users themselves, the chant to figure out how to use AI also became louder.

But there is a lot of hype and talk out there, too, and so ultimately n8n’s ease of use and usefulness seems to be what has sealed the deal with users, but also investors.

“Everyone is trying to leverage AI but struggling to find practical use cases,” David Blyghton, the general partner at Highland who led the round, told me over a phone call. “The design, scale, and throughput of n8n is what allows people to adopt it.”

Oberhauser admits that although “it took a while for the market to catch up,” now he says that around 75% of all of n8n’s customers are using the AI tools they have built.",techmeme

https://techmeme.com,Microsoft announces security AI agents to help overwhelmed humans,https://www.theverge.com/news/634598/microsoft-security-copilot-ai-agents,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:00:00 GMT","is a senior editor and author of Notepad , who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.

Microsoft launched its AI-powered Security Copilot a year ago to bring a chatbot to the cybersecurity space, and now it’s expanding it with AI agents that are designed to autonomously assist overwhelmed security teams. Microsoft is unveiling six of its own AI agents for its Security Copilot, as well as five that have been created by its partners.

Microsoft’s six security agents will be available in preview next month, and are designed to do things like triage and process phishing and data loss alerts, prioritize critical incidents, and monitor for vulnerabilities. “The six Microsoft Security Copilot agents enable teams to autonomously handle high-volume security and IT tasks while seamlessly integrating with Microsoft Security solutions,“ says Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security.

Microsoft is also working with OneTrust, Aviatrix, BlueVoyant, Tanium, and Fletch to enable some third-party security agents. These extensions will make it easier to analyze data breaches with OneTrust or perform root cause analysis of network outages and failures with Aviatrix.

AI agents are becoming an increasingly popular way for companies like Microsoft to sell businesses on AI tools. Microsoft relaunched its Copilot for businesses earlier this year with free AI chat and access to pay-as-you-go AI agents.

While these latest AI agents in the Security Copilot are designed for security teams to take advantage of, Microsoft is also improving its phishing protection in Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 will start protecting Teams users against phishing and other cyberthreats within Teams next month, including better protection against malicious URLs and attachments.

Microsoft also has a lot of other industry-specific security announcements today and at its upcoming Microsoft Secure event on April 9th. You can read more about them over at Microsoft’s security blog.",techmeme

https://techmeme.com,Splice CEO Kakul Srivastava says AI won’t ever replace human creativity,https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/632036/splice-ceo-kakul-srivastava-on-why-ai-will-never-replace-human-creativity,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT","Today, I’m talking with Kakul Srivastava, CEO of music creation platform Splice. I don’t think I need to really introduce Splice, actually — I just need to play this clip:

If you exist on planet Earth, you know that as the guitar loop from Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso,” which is an inescapable pop music phenomenon. You can check out the sample in full right here in the “Espresso” chorus.

That loop is part of a sample pack on Splice — in fact, most of “Espresso” is part of a sample pack on Splice, which is one of the biggest marketplaces for loops and samples around. You can just sign up, pay the money, download the loops, and try to make pop hits all day long. This is a part of making music now, and it has been ever since Rihanna’s monster hit “Umbrella” was built around a GarageBand loop called “Vintage Funk 03” in 2007.

Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!

Now, if you’re a Decoder listener, you know that some of my favorite conversations are with people building technology products for creatives and that I am obsessed with how technology changes the music industry, because it feels like whatever happens to music happens to everything else five years later. So this one was really interesting because Splice is all wrapped in all that — and some of its new products, including AI tools, might change how music is made all over again.

Srivastava joined Splice as its CEO three years ago. Before that, she was at Adobe, so she has a lot of experience working at a company that makes tools for a creative user base that’s threatened by things like automation and AI. But if you’ve listened to any of our Adobe episodes, you know that the flip side of that is people actually using these tools at high rates, because they’re fun to play with and make some parts of the creative process easier.

So I really wanted to dig into that with Srivastava, not only to understand where Splice stands, but also to see how the broader music industry can try and make sense of this technology and what it could do to music. I also wanted to talk about how the company navigates the incredibly complex minefield of copyright law and attribution on the internet — something that’s only getting more complicated with AI and the increasing number of copyright lawsuits filed against big AI companies.

There’s a lot in this one — and Srivastava was willing to fall pretty deep down some of these rabbit holes with me. Let me know what you think.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Kakul Srivastava, you’re the CEO of Splice. Welcome to Decoder.

I have wanted to have this conversation forever, so I’m glad I’m here.

Yeah, we ran into each other at the Code Conference last year and we just were off to the races talking about music and technology and AI, and I’m glad you’re finally here because so much has changed since then. But all of the issues are kind of still there and still working towards resolution.

Yeah, a lot has changed. A lot is going to keep changing, and you’re right, some of the core issues are still the core issues.

And along the way, at least one massive hit single has been made using loops from Splice, so there’s that.

Oh, come on. Not just one, not just one.

I think “Espresso.” There’s “Espresso” and there’s a lot of other ones.

I love “Espresso.” It’s awesome, but a very large proportion of top music everywhere uses Splice.

Let’s start with the very basics for people who maybe aren’t familiar with how music is made today or with Splice, what is Splice? What do you do for folks?

Splice is a music creation platform that is used by music creators and musicians. That’s our focus — who are our creators? And what we provide to them, we have this tagline “starts with sound,” so we do start with sound and we provide them with probably the world’s most diverse, most high-quality sonic palette. We send people all over the world. In fact, right before this, I was looking at a report from our team that just came back from Brazil, and we’re recording sounds.

We’re meeting artists on the ground, so we’re capturing the sounds of the world, and we make that available through our platform. We also provide AI-based creative tools that help you start with a sound, but make it your own. We have compositional AI. We just launched something brand new at SXSW called Splice Mic, which allows you to hum an idea, start with a musical idea right in your phone, and we’ll help you compose around that by putting the right samples next to it, to help you get you to your final track.

So there’s a lot here, which is “here are the foundational pieces of making a song,” right? “We’re going to do loops and samples, we’re going to have this library of audio,” and then there’s this turn, which I see a lot of companies that make creative software starting to make, which is, “We’re going to do it for you.”

You used to work at Adobe. Adobe I think is the paradigmatic example of this right now. You can just push generate to fill in Photoshop and it just does a bunch of stuff for you. You can prompt Photoshop now in various ways and it does stuff for you. Are you all the way there with Splice and where you’re going, where you can say, “Write me a country song,” and Splice will just do it for you?

Actually, we’re totally not. That’s totally not what we’re trying to do, and I’m so glad you asked this question because I really want to put this idea out there. Our creatives, our musicians, our artists, the people who we think about all day long, the last thing they want is someone to make the song for them. In fact, one of the things that we learned when we launched Create, out of the gate people were like, “Oh, this feels like cheating. This feels too easy. I need more controls.”

So right from day one, we’ve been adding more sophistication, more technology, more customization, more personalization for users. Because for our users, it’s really about the creative process, and how is that interesting? How are they able to get the tools to capture what’s happening inside and turn it into a song, turn it into a vibration, turn it into something that they can share with other people? So it is absolutely not push-button creation. That’s not fun.

This is a long argument in music. It goes back decades. It stretches to before AI hit the scene. You must at the company have some sense of how people perceive building music out of sample packs. And even before “Espresso,” like “Umbrella” by Rihanna was [made with] GarageBand, which I think is just a moment in music that should belong in the history books.

Totally.

How have you dealt with that? Okay, music is now just assembling a bunch of pre-made samples and that’s good or bad. People have a lot of feelings about that. Is that a framework you’re using as you enter the AI generation era?

So, I’m going to take exception with what you just said.

Sure.

I don’t think music making today is putting just a bunch of samples together. I think that using samples to create music is a really profound creative process.

By the way, I will concede that that is a very reductive criticism, but it is a criticism.

Yeah, it’s a process that’s been developed over decades that it’s really powerful. So I think of samples as the building blocks for how modern music is made, and it used to be a hip-hop thing. It used to be very specific genres, and now it’s in every genre. One of our largest growing genres is country music, which I never thought would happen, but it is. You’re using samples to make country music.

I think the artistry of using samples to make music is that you start with a sample, you start with the sound, but then you make it your own. One, how you assemble it, but how you change the sound, how you vary it, what you do inside the digital audio workstation, which is the primary creative canvas. I think that’s really important. Sorry, I got really heated about this. This is important to me.

I asked that question somewhat to provoke that response, right? Because like I said, it is a reductive criticism, but it’s a criticism that has existed. And I guess I’m curious, you have that response to the criticism of sample usage. Is that informing how you’re thinking about the criticism of AI usage?

Fundamentally, it’s about, what is the creative process? And I personally spend a ton of time with creators, and what they are telling me over and over and over again is, “I want better tools.” And when I was at Adobe, this is also something that we heard from people. “I want better tools.” And so the work for us, the work for any company that’s wanting to really meet the needs of this growing and large market is, how do you build better tools in this era of AI?

It’s not going to be, “Oh, let me type a bunch of prompts and I get a song out at the end,” but what happens next? How do I edit that? How do I change this particular part of the song and get it to sound a certain different way? How do I take this sample and make it into something else? How do I get my musical idea?

You saw this with the Splice Mic launch as well. A lot of it is: how do we get more of you into the music creation process as quickly as possible? So that’s fundamental, whether we’re talking about using a synthesizer to make music, or samples to make music, or AI to make music, how do you make sure the creative process is respected throughout those different transitions in music innovation?

That’s a lot of incoming about what your product should look like. You’re getting feedback from artists, from musicians, from other creators. There’s another side of the puzzle, particularly music, which is copyright holders and labels. Now there are these huge private equity companies that own huge catalogs that want to assert their rights in various ways. There’s the distributors themselves now, like Spotify and YouTube. Do they have a point of view that’s informing how you’re using AI, or how you’re thinking about sample licensing? Because that seems like the most complicated part of your business.

Yes and no. We are aligned across the industry — whether it’s with Universal Music or any of the other key, high-quality players in the industry — we are very aligned that the rights of the creator have to be respected. And again, our position is super simple. We’re going to focus on the creators and what creators want, and we’re going to try to meet their needs. So the rights of the creators have to be respected.

On the Splice side of things, we take this pretty seriously and we take it seriously throughout the entirety of our process, starting with ingestion. How does a sample producer or sample pack creator come into the Splice platform? We have an entire organization that does the intake, does the quality control, and checks the provenance. If you’re telling us you’re the creator, do we know that you’re really the creator? So that process of ingesting is something we take seriously.

Is it tagged effectively? Is it tagged appropriately all the way through getting onto the platform? And all the quality stuff: Is the sound clear? Is the recording nice? All of that. On the other end of it, what is the experience of someone who is downloading a sample from Splice and able to use it? We want to make sure that every single download that you do on Splice lets you download the PDF that says, “You’ve got royalty free, you’ve got full rights to this material to use it for any kind of creation.” So that’s something that’s a basic part of what we do, and it’s been that way for a long time.

On top of that is the AI story, and that’s the big story that everyone’s talking about, and I think there, it’s really simple as well. It should be, which is if you’re going to use content to train, you should train on content that you have rights to. It’s not okay to disrespect the rights of creators, and I think, again, most players in this space are pretty aligned on that.

It occurs to me just as you described that, that you are a creator platform for creators.

We are, yeah. Both sides of it.

There are people who sit around making sample packs and then they might make money uploading sample packs to Splice, and then on the other end, you’ve got artists who are downloading the sample packs, paying you money to go use some in other songs. That’s a unique situation.

It really is. Can I just add, go back to your sample thing?

Yeah.

Because you really poked me on that, and I wanted to come back to that for one second. That’s what’s really magical about using samples to make music. It’s not just a random sound that you got on Splice. There’s an artist at the other end of that. Just for the Sao Paulo team, we work with some of the people who are really at the forefront of funk, and what that means and what that sound is, and how it’s evolving.

So when you’re using a sample pack from Splice, you’re collaborating with those people, and it’s a collaboration. It’s a storytelling between those two different artists coming together. I think that’s really fun. It’s a neat part of Splice.

Are there creators who make their entire living just making sample packs for you?

There are some, yeah.

Is that a viable approach to being a professional musician?

I think it is for some people. For some people, they make hundreds of thousands of dollars. For some people, they’re building their own musical career and this is part of what they’re doing, so we see a big range of people. I will say that the revenue that we’ve shared with the artists on our platform over time, it’s at an all-time high. So it’s nice to be able to feel good about that, too.

I’ve been spending a lot of time just thinking about the economics of creator platforms, whether they’re sustainable over time. On sort of the big consumer platforms, you see that creators have to augment their income. They all have to do brand deals, they all have to do brand expansions or sponsored content or whatever.

You can’t really do that on a Splice. Is there a ceiling to how successful you can be on a Splice? I’ll just use “Espresso” as an example. Sabrina Carpenter makes “Espresso.” I’m guessing the person who made that sample pack did not get paid more money because that song was a hit, just based on how your licenses work.

Yeah, that’s the pro and the con of being royalty-free. We are royalty-free in that, what that means for the creators is they don’t have to get stressed about it. You can use the sample. It’s clear. You don’t have to worry about clearing the rights. The downside is you don’t get to share in the sort of upside when something big like that happens. We’re really here to make sure that as many people can create as possible, and that’s part of how our model works.

How does your revenue work? Where does Splice take the money?

We are a subscription platform. So people buy a subscription to Splice, and that gives them access to this unlimited library of sounds, along with the creative tools that we’re investing in heavily for the future. You get a certain number of credits per month, and use those credits to download sounds that you can then use as you want.

And is growth just getting more and more artists to use Splice on both sides, as creators and as people who are subscribers?

So that is growth and both is, it’s been an interesting journey over the last three years while I’ve been here, but growth is really good.

We should talk about that. I think that brings us to the Decoder questions. You’re a newish CEO. You’re three years in, you were at Adobe before. I think you had two different stints at Adobe?

I did. Right out of business school and when it was a perpetual business and more recently, well on its subscription journey.

Adobe is the creative software company. They have a very, I would say, back-and-forth relationship with creatives. We had [Adobe CEO] Shantanu Narayen on the show. We got feedback on that episode of Decoder like nothing else we’ve ever experienced.

I’ve heard.

People have a lot of feelings about Adobe, what that software represents, what that subscription is worth, what AI means to Adobe as a company and its user base. You obviously have some of that experience. As you’ve come into Splice, how have you thought about applying those lessons to what is well on its way to being one of those companies for the musical community?

Adobe has been a really important part of my career journey. I learned a ton of great things at Adobe, both good and bad. I was also one of the early people at Flickr, the photo-sharing site, which I don’t know if you ever used, but a lot of people loved it.

There’s some Flickr users right now who are writing us emails. I’m just letting you know, they still love it. [Laughs]

I was also head of product and marketing at GitHub. So I’ve had a chance to see creator tools in multiple different places, and all of that has really informed what I’m bringing here to Splice. The journey for me has been a little bit around pattern recognition. One thing that I’ve seen at Flickr, at GitHub, some parts of Adobe, that I see here at Splice is that you have a business that’s centered around content, and you have a lot of rich metadata around that content, and you have lots and lots of impressions around that content so that users are giving you information about it.

So at Splice, we have about a million songs that are samples that are sounds that are downloaded today. That’s a lot. We have 28 million stacks that have been created using our AI tools. So we have a lot of impressions of what sounds people are listening to, how they’re creating things together, and what sounds go well together. That’s been a really interesting thing. Once you have that data, once you have that metadata, you can use that to build rich experiences on top, which is what we’re doing now with the creative tools, the AI-based creative tools. That feels very familiar to bring to Splice, to bring to the music industry where I’ve seen it at GitHub, I’ve seen it at Flickr, I’ve seen it at these other places.

That turn to, “We are going to make the tools that actually help you create the music.” You can look at it in a slightly more abstract way, right? In an early version of Splice, you downloaded some sample packs, you would open Logic or Pro Tools, and you’re off to the races. Splice doesn’t see what you’re doing in those apps, but those are the dominant music creation apps. To this day, they’re the dominant music creation apps.

You’re suggesting with something like Splice Mic or Splice Create, you’re going to take some of that creation. Particularly on a phone, I think there’s a lot of opportunity to reinvent how we make music. It’s still fairly cumbersome. Phone screens are small. The features you launched at SXSW are interesting, because they use AI to make that a little bit faster, more seamless, more sketchy. You can sketch an idea very quickly on a phone now.Is that the extension — “We’re going to take some of Pro Tools market share. We’re going to go take some of Logic’s market share”?

So I think that word “take” suggests a zero-sum game. This is not a zero-sum game, right? It’s about expanding and exploring the creative process. Many of our users use Splice Mic, or use our mobile app as an adjunct part of their process that they will ultimately finish inside a digital audio workstation (DAW), and I love to see that. So one of our super, super top-end producers has worked with many of the big names that you would recognize. He’ll tell me, “I’ll get into my Uber, I’ll start playing the Splice app. I’ll generate a bunch of stacks so that by the time I get to the studio, I’ve got a bunch of ideas that I can show the artist right away to say, ‘Do you want to go this way or do you want to go that way?’” And that’s a really core part of his creative process.

I was just at my kid’s school where they have a digital music production class. And for them, listening to sounds on Splice is a really core part of learning, “What does this genre sound like? What does this genre sound like? What does it mean to create a Bollywood hit? What does it mean to create something that’s a K-pop sound?” And I think that’s a different way to use this experience. So for us, it’s not that we’re going to take [market share] away from this place or this place, but how do we expand how much we’re part of the creative journey in different ways?

But the idea that you’re going to start and finish a song in a Pro Tools, you’re not looking at that.

Do we think that we’re going to directly compete with Pro Tools? No, I don’t think so. I think Pro Tools has its place, just like Photoshop has its place. There are people who tell us every single day, “You will take Ableton out of my cold dead hands. It’s not going to happen.” And there are a lot of other parts of the creative process that are painful.

So for example, when I sit down with one of our creators, inevitably there will be a situation where they’re like, “Oh, we need to find a certain kind of kick drum.” And they’ll find a folder and they’ll do a subfolder and they’ll do a sub-folder, and then they’ll finally find the sub-sub-sub folder that has 20 kick drum sounds that they have saved.

You just go through and you listen to these sounds. That is painful. That is a painful process, and it shouldn’t be that hard. And so, we’ve just done this new experience that we launched in October last year where we integrated with Studio One, which is one of the top DAWs, and there’s a Splice integrated search with sound experience. So we listen to what you’re creating inside Studio One, and we’ll suggest the samples that go with it right there integrated as part of your creative workflow.

Do I think I’m going to replace Studio One? Absolutely not. Can I make the Studio One experience a lot better, because Splice is there and Splice is smart with AI? 100 percent, all day long.

How do those conversations work with all those digital audio workstation providers? They’re all very different. The companies that make them are all very different. Some of them are very quirky. Some of them are Apple, which...

All of the music tech industry is very quirky.

It’s all very quirky. There’s a lot of, I would say, eccentric Europeans floating around this industry in particular. It’s great. It’s one of my favorite parts of the tech industry to cover. And then you have a company like Apple, which is, they’re just going to do whatever it wants to do. That’s just how they work. Splice has to integrate with all of it. Some of them are expanding into your zone. They are adding sample packs, libraries, and subscription features. A lot of them are adding AI tools. How does that competition and cooperation work?

Generally speaking, it’s a very strong cooperation. I’ve actually been really impressed at how collaborative the industry really is. So the conversations with Studio One was very, very positive, and we’re working with other partners as well to bring that integration, and it’s been very, very positive. I think there’s generally a recognition that we’re good at what we do, the kind of work that we can do in terms of bringing these sample packs to the world, the global coverage, the high quality, or consistent high-quality, control process. It’s not something that they want to replicate. They want to make great experiences inside Ableton, the next feature, this is not what they want to do.

I think the AI stuff is new to a lot of people in the industry. I come from a core tech background. A lot of the team that I’ve brought into Splice over the last few years comes from a core tech background. So, we have a lot of expertise around that, which is unique in some ways for the music tech space. So I think there’s a lot of respect around that. I think there’s an attractiveness to a subscription business model that has been difficult for this industry to adopt. And so, I think there’s a lot of curiosity about that. Could we use a content business model to get more recurring revenue? But I think many people have found that it’s not as easy as it looks, and they’ve struggled with it.

One of the things you say about bringing people who have a core tech background is that helps you innovate in things like AI, I’m sure, right? Where you just need to be on the cutting edge of the technology. Tech and music in particular have always just crashed into each other. The thing I say on the show over and over again is if you pay attention to the music industry and what tech is doing to the music industry, you have the view into what tech will do to everything else five years out.

How are you thinking about that dynamic right now? Inside of Splice, you’ve said, “I need to hire more tech people.” Is it just for AI or is there something else you’re trying to accomplish with the addition of that talent?

Innovation is really important, and when I look at the music creation process, especially as an outsider, I feel like these music creators have been underserved with great innovative experiences, and I think it’s important to focus on the creative workflow and provide people better tools over time. When I think about the collision between tech and music, it’s weird because there’s actually more similarity than dissimilarity in Splice. Inside Splice, we have some really great software developers who love music, and are music creators in their own right. We have a whole bunch of musicians and artists who think in that same weird mathy way that great software developers think. So, there’s a lot of similarity. Surprisingly, there’s a lot of similarity.

I also think that there’s this mindset out there that musicians are scared of technology, scared of innovation. I actually think that musicians love hacking. They love trying new things. Again, there was all this threat around synthesizers and all of that stuff, and then Stevie Wonder took it to a totally different, magical new place. I think artists love innovation, and it allows them better tools to get to the other place. What they don’t love is push-button creation. I think if you stay away from that, if you stay close to the creative process, you will find the right ways to bring technology innovation here. I think there’s something else that you’re pushing on here that I think is important, and maybe it’s one of your Decoder questions, around how do you bring the cultural mindset from the tech industry and meld it with the music industry? And is that a difference? Is that a challenge?

Yes, that’s definitely where I’m going. I might as well ask you the Decoder questions. You’ve been the CEO for three years. How is Splice structured today? How have you changed it?

This is the tech part. We are fundamentally a product company first. So my largest organization at Splice is the product development organization, and that’s product managers, engineers, designers, and [customer support]. And what’s neat about that is, I do keep CX very close to product. Because I think that tight loop is super important.

Wait, I just want to make sure. CX is customer experience?

Customer support.

Customer support, okay.

So support, design, engineers, [product managers], they’re all in one org and that’s product development, and it’s our largest org. Our second largest org is our content team. And those are the people that they’re going to Brazil, they’re going to South Korea, they’re going to India, they’re recording these sounds. It’s our quality control department. It’s our data and ingesting, and metadata tagging groups. So that’s the content org.

Maybe the third thing that I’ll point out that’s really important to me and how I structure the org. Is we have a very strong central data organization that reports directly to me. So a lot of people put that inside product dev, but for me, data’s important for content, data’s important for marketing. Data’s obviously important for finance and how we run the business. It’s really important for product. So I have that as a central organization, and again, it reports directly to me.

How big is Splice now? How many people is it?

We’re about 200 people, a little bit less than 200 people.

And how is it split between those three groups?

So product dev is our largest org, maybe 80, 60, somewhere between there. And then content is the next biggest, and it’s somewhere between 40 and 60.

One of the really interesting things here, again, it’s a creator platform for creators, which is just an interesting dynamic. Other creator platforms at scale, they say they have investments in content teams, but they really just hope the scale carries them forward, right? Instagram does not have some huge content team that is traveling the world to get content. They just wait for people to come to them.

It’s the same with YouTube or TikTok or whoever else. They might manage some of their top influencers, but really the volume of content comes to them. Is that a tipping point that you think Splice can reach, or do you want to maintain control over the library?

It’s really important for us to make sure our library is the highest quality that it can be. So, it’s not going to be a free-for-all where anyone is uploading anything they want, because we need to maintain that high quality, especially in the age of AI, right? There’s all kinds of stuff that’s being uploaded to all of these big platforms, so it’s never going to be that way for us.

And so, that’s just a core investment, right? It’s a core piece of, I think, your cost model. How was Splice organized before? Again, you’re three years into it, how have you changed that structure? Is it still largely the same, or have you reoriented the company?

So I think the biggest change has been around, I would say, three big ideas Nilay, which are core to how I run a business. The first is data. I’ve brought in a lot more data people. It’s very, very critical. The reason that’s important for me is because I need to understand what our customers actually care about. So, how are they voting with their clicks as opposed to whatever opinions everybody else has. So, that’s a big investment.

The second is design, and that is really where data and the math and the science turns into something else, which is a real experience that people can feel. It’s where the art becomes magic. The reason that’s important is because we’re serving creative people, and that’s what creative people do as well — they take all of these inputs and they turn it into something new.

So building a strong design team that is either made up of music creators themselves or people who spend a lot of time with music creators is really important. And the third thing that I really brought in that’s important is that we build our products with the customers. So everything that we launch, there are tools that we built in to allow people to give us feedback. In fact, when we launched Create, the biggest button in the Create experience was the feedback button. It was weird, but it was important for us.

Every single time someone typed in something to give us feedback, it comes into a Slack channel that’s with all the designers and the engineers and the product managers. So we’re actively talking about the feedback from the customers as it’s coming in, and responding to it for the next version. I love that. I absolutely love that we build product that way. I think everyone should build product that way.

One of the reasons I always ask about structure on the show is that it’s a proxy for culture. You kind of get what you get. You make some big choices about how things are organized, and that leads to a culture. You’re in an interesting spot because you took over for co-founders. One co-founder left, he was a CTO in 2019. The other co-founder, Steve Martocci, he’s the executive chairman now, but he’s off doing another startup. How have you thought about changing the culture, inheriting the culture, and the balance between the two?

The reason I love your question around structure is because I do see that it’s a proxy for values, and that’s why I answered it the way I did around data, design, and building with customers. Those are fundamental values that I want to bring and inculcate into the company. There’s something else that we also did that was around building culture. I spent a lot of time listening to the team, trying to learn what made this culture unique, and then I reflected back to the organization, “Hey, these are the values that I’m hearing from you all. Do you think this captures it?”

And we came up with something that we call our DISCO values: direct, inclusive, Spliced together, creator-centric, and optimistic. And even though these are new values that we came up with after I joined, they have felt so authentic to the culture that we have that’s existed for a long time, but it’s given voice to it. So DISCO is something we talk about a lot. Every single new employee that comes on talks about which DISCO value they resonate with most. We use it in performance reviews. We do use it for shout-outs. It’s a core part of who we are.

The second Decoder question, which is also in many ways a proxy for culture and values, is about decisions. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework?

This is something that I’m working on. I’ve always been a very math and science kind of person. I’ve always been someone who’s very analytical. I use a lot of data. I have a framework for decision-making. I study all the different tools for decision-making, but as the decision sets that come to me become more complex, and as we operate in an increasingly more complex world, fires, politics, etc., I have found myself relying more and more on intuition, and I think balancing those two.

So, I would say that my decision-making process is, I will drown myself in data. I will really get deep. People know in my team that I spend a lot of time on our dashboards. I will spend a lot of time watching research videos and understanding how people are using our tools. I will spend a lot of time personally talking to different customers. I’m talking to customers all the time, and once I’ve kind of drowned myself in all this information, I’ll just try to listen deeply, and usually the answer is very clear.

All right. We’re going to put this into practice because the “making creative software for creative people in the age of AI” is about as tense as it gets in the balance between what the numbers are telling us and how the people feel. And what I mean specifically is the numbers are telling everyone that people are using the AI tools. Just down the line, every software maker I’ve talked to has introduced AI tools with any meaningful value, says the users are using them, they’re clicking the buttons, they’re doing generative fill all day long. I’m sure you see that in your numbers, too.

Then what you hear from the creatives on social media or online, or in letters to Congress is, “Get this out of my face. They stole everything from me.” And that is about as big of a divide in tech, in culture, in creativity as I have ever experienced. I think that is challenging a lot of how everyone is going to make decisions. So I’m going to read you a quote from one of your ostensible competitors, and it tracks with everything you’re saying, but I suspect you are going to disagree with this quote, and I just want to sit with that for a minute.

Yeah, let’s do it.

So you have said, “Right, creators just want to create, they want all this stuff to get out of their way.” So here’s the CEO of Suno, Mikey Shulman. Suno is just “push a button, it makes you a song,” right? You say country song, it just spits out a country song at you. And here’s what he recently said: “It takes a lot of time, a lot of practice. You have to get really good at an instrument or really good at a piece of production software. I think the majority of people don’t enjoy the majority of time they spend making music. It is not really enjoyable to make music now.”

Now I’ve made a lot of music. I have no idea what Mikey Shulman is talking about. I think it’s quite fun to make music, but that does track with what you’re saying, that you just want to get the software out of the way. You want to get the creators creating. But he spun the knob all the way to “just prompt me for a song.” And a lot of people reacted to this quote very strongly.

Yeah, I heard a lot of feedback.

How do you sit in the middle of that to say, “There’s a line and I’m going to enforce the line, and we’re not just going to prompt it all the way to a song?”Also, do you think he’s right? Do you think people don’t enjoy making music?

Here’s what I have learned by serving creative people for most of my career: the creative process is essential for people who create. It’s not essential for everybody. For the people who create, it is a sacred experience. It is a core part of who they are. They can’t not do it. And there is a struggle, but the struggle is to authentically translate what is inside you into something else. And sometimes, your tools will help you —will enable you to do that — and other times your tools will get in the way. Understanding the distinction between those two is the whole ball game, but it’s really about allowing the struggle to come to life.

Giving birth to something new is hard, but it’s profoundly important, and to dismiss it by this push-button set of tools, it’s insulting, it’s dismissive, it’s reductive. And, I think the creative process and creative people deserve better. They deserve better technology that enables them, as opposed to reducing this profound activity to a button.

So this is where I think the line is inherently qualitative, right? “Well, here’s what we’re going to do and here’s what we’re not going to do.” And the tension of, “It’s not really enjoyable to make music now,” you can describe that as using the software sucks, or I just want to have an idea and hear it as fast as I can. And then you can describe it the way you’re saying, which is there’s some parts of the struggle that are the creative process, which make the art compelling.

It’s profoundly important.

If the data tells you that people really want to just click the button and make the music, are your values strong enough to not send you all the way down the road?

I think it depends on which people you’re listening to. We are really clear about the people that we’re listening to. We are listening to creative people who love the process of music creation, that it’s essential for them. Yes, are there challenges? But the challenge is the creative process, right? That is the challenge. And for those people, the signals are really clear. They do not want push button creativity. In fact, like I was sharing before, when we gave them Create for the first time, they’re like, “This is too simple. I don’t want this. I want something that gives me more creative freedom, more creative control.” And so for us, the signal, the people we’re listening to are super clear and the signals they’re giving us, there’s no confusion in what they want. They want more creative process. They want more creative control.

The other side of this marketplace is consumers. We see consumers and fans all the time now react very strongly to AI generated imagery. In particular, you make a movie poster and it’s got a bunch of AI in it. The fans are going to–

It’s not just Photoshop.

That movie poster is coming down. It’s maybe different in AI. It’s not in your face. You can’t see that the characters in the movie poster have 12 fingers and their hair bleeds into the skyscraper behind them. It’s not as obvious, but it’s there. Do you perceive that kind of consumer or fan backlash to AI in music the same way that we see it in visual art?

We haven’t seen it yet. Here’s what I have seen. I have seen really clear signals from our customers that they are not really interested in computer-generated samples, and it’s clearly not our strategy. We are in fact investing in more human-created samples, human-curated samples. This is why we’re sending people out to the sort of subgenre locations, talking to authentic artists, getting their voices. It’s really important for our strategy to continue to do that, because people want to connect with the stories of the real artists on the other side of the sample. So that’s really, really important, and really clear for us.

I think what an end user who’s listening to Sabrina Carpenter today and will listen to somebody else’s music tomorrow, what they can hear is going to be interesting, is going to evolve over time. I love that Kendrick Lamar won the Pulitzer Prize for music, and the people who won the Pulitzer Prize for music, when that award was first introduced, it was a completely different sound. So what art is and what is acceptable changes over time. I would expect it to continue to change over time, so I don’t want to reflect on that. I know that artists will use different tools, and they will use AI-based tools. Absolutely.

At least on the visual imagery side, there’s a lot of endless, sort of futile, discussion about watermarks and encryption, and letting people know when images were edited by AI or created by AI. I would not say that’s come to anything, and I would say there are some deep and meaningful challenges with even making that technology work consistently. There’s not anything quite like that on the music side.

No, there isn’t.

Do you think there should be?

I think it’s going to be really hard to disambiguate around sound, and around images, around video. You’ve had some really great conversations about this topic on your podcast. I’ve listened to them. I think it’s a really important debate and discussion to have. There is going to be a bunch of bad AI-generated content out there. It’s already happening. It’s going to happen with music. I think that the toothpaste is out of the tube.

I think as an industry, we have to do the right thing around respecting the rights of creators, and doing the right thing with respect to training data, respecting credits. This is work that has to happen. I don’t think it’s solved yet. Maybe some of these cases that are open will help us get to the right answer, but I don’t think it’s going to come out of watermarking.

You talked about the flood of AI content that’s coming. We can all see it. The big consumer platforms are embracing it. I think to some extent, Mark Zuckerberg would love it if all the content on Facebook was AI and he was paying zero out to creators. I think to some extent, YouTube is really leaning into the idea that you should interact with your favorite creators through AI avatars, and that they should make even more videos or AI should help them make even more videos to increase the volume of content that appears.

That’s all very complicated. I don’t know exactly how it’s going to play out, but I understand the incentives for those platforms to make those choices to say, “Actually, what we want always is more content because that will create more attention and we can serve more ads, and we’re in this finite zero-sum intention game.” You’re not in that game specifically. You don’t have those incentives, and you do allow artists to make music with AI using your tools. Do you allow AI-generated samples to enter your library?

We do not. We do not.

Draw that distinction. Why is it okay to make music with AI but not to have it in the sample library?

I think it’s what users are coming to Splice for today. They are coming to find those authentic sounds made by humans. That’s not to say that people aren’t using AI to master sounds or things like that. You’re using AI to master your audio and video probably here. I think those are tools, and that’s fine as long as there’s an authentic artist’s artistic vision and voice behind it. So, that’s super important for us to continue to be focused there. With respect to these social platforms that you’re talking about, I think that’s a really important insight. And inasmuch as these social platforms are important for our creators as a way to share their output, to share their musical idea, they’re really important for us.

But these social platforms have grown because they allow people to have emotional connection with each other. “I’m really angry about this particular issue,” or “I’m reaching out for support for these fires in LA,” or these connections that we make, and finding support around this very specific cancer that I have that I can’t find other people to connect with online. If we erode that, if we erode those actual emotional connections between people in order to save a buck in paying out creators, I think the value of these platforms will diminish over time, and maybe that’s okay. Maybe we shouldn’t spend so much time on TikTok. Maybe we should spend more time creating music on our own.

So I think these are really interesting evolutions that are going to happen in the industry. And as a mom, I care a lot about where some of this stuff goes. For Splice and as the CEO of Splice, my focus is going to stay the same, which is I’m focused on creators, I’m focused on what they need, and so many things our users create just to hang out on their desktop because it was just for the joy of creating. And some of it goes on and becomes a Billboard top 100 hit. Great. I’m happy that that happens, but I’m just as happy that someone is spending time creating, and it just hangs out on their desktop.

Let me ask that again in just a different frame. I want to push on it. It feels important to me.

Yeah.

We’ve talked a lot about active creation and what the tools are for and the fact that your customers, artists, do not want ready-made, push-button songs. They want controls. They want to add something to what the computer-generated product is giving them, right? They want to add something to the AI, they want to add something to the samples, and that process of addition creates additional value. Some very important songs have been made that way using Splice and other tools.

But you’re saying that is not a good enough argument to get AI-generated audio into the sample library, and I’m just wondering why the difference, because you could make the same argument. I use Splice to generate some samples. I tweak them, I filter them. I made a bunch of different things. If it’s good enough for me to send to a major label and play on the radio, shouldn’t it be good enough to get into the Splice sample library?

So I think that the distinction in my mind, and I think for many of our creators is that, is it AI-generated, or was AI used as a tool to bring a human creator’s idea to life? Do people use technology to create the samples that end up on Splice? Absolutely. People are using Pro Tools. People are using synthesizers. People are using lots of tools and technology, and like I said, some of those tools might be AI-based, like mastering tools or mixing tools, things like that.

That is really different from, “I’ve created an algorithm to pump out a whole bunch of samples that are computer-generated for the mass market.” Those are not going to end up on Splice, I will guarantee, but if there’s an authentic user, the Stevie Wonder of the AI age, who is creating art that they care deeply about, and they’re using AI tools as part of that process, absolutely. That distinction is very important.

I agree it’s important. I just don’t know how to write it down in a way that can be consistently enforced across all the geographies that you’re operating in, with all of your teams going out in the world, or in a way that’s understandable to artists who might want to be part of Splice. Is there a definition you have of where the line is? For how much AI is too much?

For me, again, I will take it down to something very simple. There’s a human being who we have a relationship with on both sides of our platform, and so on the side of the platform where we are working with a musician, an artist, an instrumentalist who wants to provide a sample to Splice. We actually have a relationship with them, and we talk to them about what they’re trying to do, what the idea behind their label is, what is their artistic vision, and we will work with them. What is your tool set? How are you doing it? How many sample packs do we need every quarter? All of those kinds of things. And some of those people are, there’s a Japanese potter who is making handmade percussion instruments that he then records, that end up on Splice. That’s a really cool part of the process.

And then, we’ve got crazy kids making all kinds of super electronic, super grungy, super sharp technical sounds, and they’ve got a different tool set that they’re using as part of their process. We’re not going to tell them, “Oh, you can’t use this tool because it’s AI-generated or not,” but do you have that authentic vision for what you’re creating? And it’s not that difficult to tell the difference between a person who is creating that way, and a person who is like, “I typed in a bunch of prompts and I got a whole plethora of computer-generated sounds.”

The other extremely challenging piece of the puzzle with AI-generated content is when you veer into impersonation. We’ve seen this in the hip-hop industry a lot recently. We’ve seen it with OpenAI and Scarlett Johansson’s voice. There’s a lawsuit. The voice got pulled. Who knows how that’s going to play out? We see there’s the Elvis Act, in Tennessee where impersonation is illegal, and I don’t think there’s a great answer for whether Elvis impersonators themselves are now illegal. Are you playing in that space where you’re letting people use artist voices or sound-alikes?

We’re not. I think there are lots of people who are playing in that space or interested in that space. We are focused on creative people, and creative people are actually really clear with us. They are coming to Splice because they want to find their authentic sound, and so we work really hard at the very other end of that, which is how do we allow our users to authentically find their own vibe?

Voices is one thing, right? They’re pretty recognizable. The fake Drake song set the industry ablaze. It was just very obviously a fake Drake song, or Drake’s voice. There’s not a great legal system for saying, “That’s Drake’s voice. You can’t use it.” We’ll get there. It seems like we’re on our way to understanding how to get there.

Then there’s kind of the existing mess of music copyright. We talk about the “Blurred Lines” case on this show a lot. I think more than any other podcast we’ve talked about “Blurred Lines,” a song which came and went and whose moment is over, but it continues to come up on Decoder maybe once a month, right? That lawsuit is “you guys stole a vibe from Marvin Gaye, not notes, not chords, not anything direct,” but the jury was like, “These vibes are too close. Robin Thicke and Pharrell have to pay the money.”

That’s something you could very easily see a user of Splice wandering into, right? “We’re going to prompt for a beat. We’re going to do a stack. We’re going to layer some samples and we’re going to get to a vibe that’s too close to another artist.” Is that something you worry about? Is that something you try to protect users from? It feels like in the age of AI, it’s ever more of a danger.

It is, and it’s also been a core part of how music evolves over time. There’s this whole conversation around reheated nachos and what that means, and I think artists and musicians build upon each other’s work. They’re influenced by each other, and this conversation’s been around since the beginning of sampling, which is “what am I referring to when I use this sample, and what’s the story that I’m trying to tell?”

You could argue that it’s derivative, or you could argue that it’s an homage, or you could argue that it’s building on a shared piece of work that’s a community piece of work that continues to evolve over time. I think that that’s what makes art and music in particular super fascinating. I love that you guys have this whole debate around that particular song. I think it’s fascinating. I think it’s going to continue to grow, and what’s right and wrong should be defined by the artists.

But the idea that you would accidentally boost too much of an existing song by using an AI tool, which is trained on bits and pieces of existing songs. That’s a new danger, right? I mean, the cycle you’re talking about with music, I agree has existed since music. We’re all building on one another. We’re all lifting bits and pieces. Great artists steal. Everybody kind of understands it, and along the way, there has been a lot of litigation. That’s the other part of the cycle.

The push and pull is people being very unhappy about the money, and now we’re at a place where it’s easier than ever to be derivative, and the money is absolutely not clear — that artists are very upset about their work being trained on, maybe not in your tools, but certainly in other tools. The labels are suing Suno and Udio, its competitor, for training on their data. Do you see that resolving? Because it seems like the problem is going to get worse faster than the legal system will even comprehend the technology.

Most of these problems get worse before the legal system catches up. I mean, we know this. We know this for privacy, we know this for many areas. Technology outpaces how quickly legislative action catches up. I think in the music industry, we’re doing a lot of work to try to create standards within, so we’re a part of a coalition of, again, great companies in the music space that are saying, “We’ve got to support ethical AI. We have to support the rights of creators. We have to make sure our training data is clean.”

So, I think there are a lot of companies that are trying to do the right thing. Is there one standard that has won out amongst all the others? No, but I know that a lot of people are working really hard on this problem, and we are too. We care deeply about the rights of creators, so that’s going to stay really important for us.

How do you feel about the labels suing Suno and Udio? Is that something that’s a warning sign for you? Is that something you support? Do you think that that is going to get resolved?

I think what the labels are trying to do is support the rights of the creators, and we are a creator-centric company, so we absolutely support the rights of the creators. Do I take one side or the other? No. Ultimately, it’s always going to be about the creators first, and I know my customers deeply care about the fact that they have rights to the content they create using Splice.

That’s why we allow people to download the rights PDF. It matters to people, even if they’re not putting their song up on Spotify or trying to make a billion dollars from it, they want to know that they have the ability to do that. So that’s what governs our decisions around clean training data, ethical AI, etc.

If I wanted to sign up for a Splice account, download a bunch of tracks, and then train my own AI on them, is that allowed in your license?

It’s not allowed.

And you spell that out. You say you can’t train AI on these tracks?

Yeah.

I bring this up and you probably don’t know, I’m going to pre-apologize to you for this question because I know you haven’t seen this document, but just go with it. Basically what I’m saying, I’m asking a question just today, I’m sure you haven’t seen it, but Google filed a letter with the government basically saying, “Look, you need to make an exception of fair use to allow us to train on everything.” OpenAI filed a similar letter in the past few days.

There’s a big push from the AI companies to say, “Look, we just need this stuff. Give it to us. We don’t want to pay for this. It has to be fair use. This is going to slow us down too much.” At the same time, you’re saying, “Here in our license we’re saying you can’t do that.” Do you think that can get resolved? That seems like a big problem where if you steal enough of it, you get to write a letter to the government saying, “Write us an exception.” And if you steal a little of it, you might end up in court. And I don’t know how to resolve that.

Yeah, I don’t either. It’s such an important issue. And the scale of the Internet, the scale of content on the internet is so vast that — What is fair use? What is not fair use? What is public consumption? What is public record? What is public ownership? We are in uncharted territory, and we’re going to be watching it just like you are.

How would you write a fairer system if you were clean sheeting this? How would you write a fairer system that makes creators feel valued, gets them paid, and still allows people to build these AI systems that a lot of people are getting some value out of?

I would love to say that I’m the expert who could write something like that. I have a much more straightforward problem to look after, which is, how do I help creative people be creative and get the ideas from their hearts and minds out there? Yeah, I’m going to leave that problem to people way smarter than me, who are legal minds who are working really hard on this.

Well, if I get anyone on the show who has an answer, I’ll let you know.

You’re a lawyer, right?

I just talk for a living. I haven’t done anything useful in a long time. Kakul, you’ve given us so much time. What’s next for Splice? What should people be looking out for?

So, what’s next for Splice is that we’re going to keep going deeper into the creative process. I’ve been really public about this with my blog posts and all of that. Users keep telling us, “I love Splice. I want it deeper in my creative process.” So whether it’s these partnerships that we’re doing with DAWs, thinking through how we build more creative flexibility for users on our own platform, whether it’s with Create or Splice Mic, there’s a lot for us still to do, and we’ll keep going down that path.

All right. We’ll have to have you back soon as some of these issues play out. Thank you so much for coming by.

I would love to. I had such an enjoyable conversation. Thank you so much, Nilay.

https://techmeme.com,Apple’s AirPods Max with USB-C will soon support lossless audio,https://www.theverge.com/news/634506/apple-airpods-max-lossless-audio-low-latency-usb-c,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 13:18:11 GMT","is a senior reviewer who has worked at The Verge since its founding in 2011. His coverage areas include audio (Sonos, Apple, Bose, Sony, etc.), home theater, smartphones, photography, and more.

Apple is bringing higher-fidelity audio to its AirPods Max headphones in April, the company announced today. When the $549 headphones switched to a USB-C connector last year, they lost support for wired audio playback — but Apple is about to rectify that with full lossless support, which even the prior Lightning model technically lacked.

“With the included USB-C cable, users can enjoy the highest-quality audio across music, movies, and games, while music creators can experience significant enhancements to songwriting, beat making, production, and mixing,” the company wrote in a press release on Monday. “With this update, AirPods Max will unlock 24-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio, preserving the integrity of original recordings and allowing listeners to experience music the way the artist created it in the studio.” Lossless support “extends to Personalized Spatial Audio,” Apple noted.

Aside from richer sound, the new update enables ultra low latency on the AirPods Max, which makes them better suited for music production, gaming, and live streaming purposes, according to the company.

The firmware update will roll out alongside iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 sometime in April. You can use a USB-C to USB-C cord for lossless audio, but Apple is also now selling a $39 USB-C to 3.5mm audio cable that shares the same braided design as its other recent cables.

The previous edition of the AirPods Max with a Lightning connector don’t offer true “lossless” playback because of a signal conversion that occurs whenever a wired audio source is used. It’s still better quality than you’d get listening over Bluetooth, however.",techmeme

Almost every coder we surveyed had strong opinions on the matter. Here’s ChatGPT’s summary of the responses (with its boldface emphasis preserved):

“The coders have spoken—and they’re not packing up their keyboards just yet. While a small but vocal group insists AI will devour programming jobs in time, most dismiss full automation as a pipe dream. The doom prophets warn that corporate bosses will slash payrolls the moment AI looks capable, leaving human engineers debugging their own obsolescence. The skeptics scoff, arguing AI is more like a hyperefficient intern—useful, but clueless—that can’t handle context, edge cases, or real problem-solving. The realists see AI as a force multiplier, not a job killer—automating repetitive coding but leaving the creativity, architecture, and debugging to humans. “If AI does eat programming,” one put it, “I’ll just switch to debugging AI.”* The real verdict? AI isn’t coming for your job—but it is changing it. Adapt or get left behind.🚀”

*Nobody actually said this! ChatGPT—bless it—made several mistakes throughout this process. Not only did it fabricate quotes, it also misread results, generated incomprehensible graphs, and, at multiple points, stopped counting “freelancers” as a category entirely. Rude.**

**In its way, ChatGPT invited this feedback. When asked for final tips, it suggested “a touch of snark, because AI discourse is full of strong opinions.”",techmeme

“I remind Californians to consider invoking their rights and directing 23andMe to delete their data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company,” he said in a statement.

The company said there will be “no changes” to the way it protects consumer data while in bankruptcy court.

It’s a privacy nightmare but also an example of how state privacy laws pioneered in California can help protect Americans — at least the proactive ones.

Founded in 2006, 23andMe was a pioneer in the quest to unlock knowledge from the human genome. It offers customers information about their family tree and hereditary characteristics, while researching new kinds of treatments.

But in recent years, 23andMe has been slammed by simultaneous business and security challenges. It went public in 2021 but burned through its cash and watched its value drop from about $6 billion to around $50 million now.

In 2023, it had a data breach that affected some 7 million customers. Hackers used customers’ old passwords to gain access to information that in some cases included family trees, birth years and geographic locations.

In September, 23andMe’s board of directors quit after rejecting CEO Anne Wojcicki’s proposals to take the company private. With the bankruptcy announcement, Wojcicki quit to pursue another bid for the business.

23andMe didn’t immediately respond to my questions. But in its Sunday filing announcing bankruptcy, it said it “intends to continue operating its business in the ordinary course throughout the sale process.”

The privacy risks

Bonta, the California attorney general, didn’t specify the risks of leaving your “trove of sensitive consumer data” with 23andMe. But privacy advocates I’ve spoken to have been watching the company’s challenges with concern on several fronts.

First, you are relying on 23andMe to keep your DNA safe from hackers. But that could be hard for any company to do under bankruptcy proceedings — and 23andMe has had plenty of security trouble in the past. (On its website, 23andMe says the company has achieved three certifications to demonstrate the strength of its security program.)

Advertisement

There’s also a risk that your data could get sold or transferred to a new company, which might want to use it for new purposes. The privacy statement of 23andMe seems to treat your data as a company asset that’s on the table like anything else. It reads: “If we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your Personal Information may be accessed, sold or transferred as part of that transaction.”

On the website page to delete your data, 23andMe says: “If the company does change ownership in the future, your data will remain protected under the current 23andMe Privacy Policy unless and until you are presented with materially new terms, with appropriate advanced notice to review those material changes as required by law.”

A new owner could also try to change the company’s practices and privacy policy — and it would be on you to keep on top of the changes.

“The DNA data could be used to discern your relatives and ancestry, unearth family secrets, and reveal clues about diseases you have or could be predisposed to. If the data makes its way to certain insurers, they may deny you coverage or charge you more for life, disability, or long-term care insurance because of your genetics,” said Ginny Fahs, director of product R&D for Consumer Reports’ Innovation Lab.

“This is some of the most precious data that exists about you; you’re right to be concerned that it may be up for grabs,” she said.

But you do have rights over your data before any of that comes to pass. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 gives you the right to delete data from businesses that collect it. While the law specifically applies to California residents, many other states have passed similar laws.

California also has a separate law pertaining to DNA data, called the Genetic Information Privacy Act. It gives you the right to delete your account, have your biological sample destroyed, and revoke consent you may have previously given to use or disclose your genetic data.

Before you delete your data, you might want to choose to download some or all of it. If you do, just make sure you have a good way to store and keep it safe. Unlike a password or telephone number, this is data you’re stuck with for the rest of your life.",techmeme
https://techmeme.com,Genetic testing company 23andMe declares bankruptcy,https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/genetic-testing-company-23andme-declares-bankruptcy/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 14:55:22 GMT","On Sunday, the genetic testing and heritage company 23andMe announced that it had entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy and was asking a court to arrange its sale. The company has been losing money for years, and a conflict between its board and CEO about future directions led to the entire board resigning back in September. Said CEO, Anne Wojcicki, has now resigned and will be pursuing an attempt to purchase the company and take it private.

At stake is the fate of genetic data from the company's 15 million customers. The company has secured enough funding to continue operations while a buyer is found, and even though US law limits how genetic data can be used, the pending sale has raised significant privacy concerns.

Risky business

The company launched around the time that ""gene chips"" first allowed people to broadly scan the human genome for sites where variations were common. A few of these variants are associated with diseases, and 23andMe received approval to test for a number of these. But its big selling point for many people was the opportunity to explore their heritage. This relied on looking broadly at the patterns of variation and comparing those to the patterns typically found in different geographic regions. It's an imperfect analysis, but it can often provide a decent big-picture resolution of a person's ancestry.

23andMe faced a number of challenges, though. For starters, the gene chips quickly became commodities, allowing a large range of competitors to enter the field, some of which had stronger backgrounds in things like linking genealogies to public records. This commodification also meant that many potential 23andMe partners in the pharmaceutical industry, who might be interested in gene/disease linkages, could affordably build their own databases or simply rely on some of the public resources that have since been developed, like the UK's Biobank.",techmeme
https://techmeme.com,California AG Reminds 23andMe Customers of Data Deletion Rights,https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/california-23andme-data-rights/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 11:30:00 GMT","California Attorney General Rob Bonta has reminded customers of struggling biotech firm 23andMe of their right to direct the deletion of their genetic data.

These rights fall under California’s Genetic Information Privacy Act (GIPA) and the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).

The public advisory, published on the State of California Department of Justice’s website on March 21, followed the California-based company's public report that it is in financial distress and doubt surrounding its ability to continue as a going concern.

Two days later, 23andMe announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US to initiate the sale of its assets.

Mark Jensen, Chair and Member of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors, said in a statement: “After a thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives, we have determined that a court-supervised sale process is the best path forward to maximize the value of the business.”

On March 24, 2025, CEO and Co-Founder Anne Wojcicki announced on X she has resigned as CEO and intends to be an independent bidder for the firm’s ownership.

23andMe’s Data Breach, Board Shakeup and Major Restructuring

The announcement follows a series of significant setbacks for 23andMe. After its initial public offering (IPO) in 2021, which saw the company reach a valuation of up to $6bn, the company struggled to gain investor confidence, failing to turn a profit and saw its market capital steadily decline.

To address the situation, a board of independent directors was formed in March 2024. In July, Wojcicki submitted a proposal to take the company private again.

The offer was rejected and the seven directors resigned in September, 2024.

At the same time, in March 2024, the company agreed to pay a $30m settlement to the victims of a 2023 data breach while denying “any wrongdoing whatsoever.”

The data breach resulted in the exposure of genetic data for 6.9 million users, including 6.4 million in the US.

The firm also agreed to bolster its security in the wake of the incident, including mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA), protection against credential stuffing and annual audits.

At the end of 2024, the company announced the layoff of 40% of its 200-employee workforce as part of a restructuring effort.

Customers’ Right Over 23AndMe Data

In his advisory, Attorney General Bonta said California’s GIPA and the CCPA grants Californian customers of 23AndMe permission to:

Delete their genetic data from 23andMe

Revoke permission for their genetic data to be used for research

Destroy their 23andMe test sample

According to Tilo Weigandt, COO and Co-founder of Vaultree, the user data handled by 23andMe is sensitive genetic and health-related information, which is considered special category data and receives the highest level of protection under the EU’s and UK’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Like Attorney General Bonta, Weigandt believes 23andMe customers in the UK and the EU should:

Review the privacy policy and past consents they gave to 23andMe

Exercise their right to data erasure if they no longer wish for their data to be retained or transferred

Monitor announcements from data protection agencies across the EU and the UK or any future communications regarding the sale or restructuring of 23andMe

Despite the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the firm, on March 24, 23andMe said that it “remains open for business, and there are no changes to the way we store, manage or protect customer data.”

The company is currently valued at approximately $48.56m.

https://techmeme.com,Silicon Valley Failure: 23andMe Files for Bankruptcy in Stunning Collapse,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/03/24/silicon-valley-failure-23andme-files-for-bankruptcy-in-stunning-collapse/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","DNA testing company and former Silicon Valley darling 23andMe has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and announced the resignation of its co-founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki.

TechCrunch reports that the genetics testing giant 23andMe has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States, signaling a significant downturn for the once-promising company. The move comes as the company seeks to initiate the sale of its assets in an effort to address mounting financial and operational challenges. Breitbart News previously reported that the company’s entire board of directors had resigned.

Alongside the bankruptcy filing, 23andMe’s co-founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki announced her resignation from the company. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Wojcicki stated, “While I am disappointed that we have come to this conclusion and my bid was rejected, I am supportive of the company, and I intend to be a bidder.” Wojcicki’s decision to step down as CEO allows her to pursue the company as an independent bidder in the court-supervised sale process.

It is not clear how the bankruptcy and Wojcicki’s independent bid to take over the company will effect the privacy of its millions of customers.

Founded in 2006, 23andMe rose to prominence as a pioneer in the direct-to-consumer DNA testing market, offering customers insights into their genetic ancestry and health predispositions through saliva-based test kits. However, the company has struggled to maintain its footing in recent years, facing a series of setbacks that have severely impacted its market value and profitability.

In 2021, 23andMe went public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), initially boasting a market capitalization of $6 billion. However, the company’s value has since plummeted by more than 99 percent, with its stock trading at just $1.79 at the time of writing. This dramatic decline can be attributed to the company’s inability to turn a profit and navigate an increasingly competitive market.

One of the most significant blows to 23andMe came in 2023 when the company fell victim to a massive cyberattack. Hackers managed to steal the data of nearly 7 million customers, including sensitive information such as genetic predisposition and ancestry reports. The incident led to a $30 million settlement in a lawsuit related to the data breach in September 2024, further compounding the company’s financial woes.

In light of these challenges, the Special Committee of 23andMe’s Board of Directors has determined that a court-supervised sale process is the best path forward to maximize the value of the business. Mark Jensen, chair and member of the Special Committee, stated, “We expect the court-supervised process will advance our efforts to address the operational and financial challenges we face, including further cost reductions and the resolution of legal and leasehold liabilities.”

The bankruptcy filing and potential sale of 23andMe’s assets raise questions about the future of the company and the security of its customers’ genetic data. As the court-supervised process unfolds, it remains to be seen whether the company will find a suitable buyer and whether Wojcicki’s independent bid will be successful.

Embattled genetic testing company 23andMe , once valued at $6 billion, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Missouri federal court on Sunday night.

The company's CEO, Anne Wojcicki, has resigned from her role as chief executive effective immediately, though she will remain a member of the board. Joseph Selsavage, 23andMe's chief financial and accounting officer, will serve as interim CEO, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

""We have had many successes but I equally take accountability for the challenges we have today,"" Wojcicki wrote in a post on X early Monday morning. ""There is no doubt that the challenges faced by 23andMe through an evolving business model have been real, but my belief in the company and its future is unwavering.""

23andMe declined to comment further on the filing.

The former billionaire co-founded 23andMe in 2006, and the company rocketed into the mainstream because of its at-home DNA testing kits that gave customers insight into their family histories and genetic profiles. The five-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company went public in 2021 via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, which valued 23andMe at around $3.5 billion at the time.

23andMe's stock has mostly been in free fall in recent years as the company struggled to generate recurring revenue and stand up viable research and therapeutics businesses. As of Monday morning, the company has a market capitalization of around $25 million.",techmeme
https://techmeme.com,23andMe’s Former CEO Is Posting Through Its Bankruptcy Filing,https://gizmodo.com/23andmes-former-ceo-is-posting-through-its-bankruptcy-filing-2000579738,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 15:27:55 GMT","Genetic testing company 23andMe has filed for bankruptcy after its board rejected a bid from its CEO to take it private. Four years ago the genetic testing company was valued at $3.5 billion. Now it’ll be lucky if someone pays $50 million for it. If you haven’t done it yet, there’s never been a better time to delete your 23andMe data.

The company filed for bankruptcy on Sunday after weeks of a collapsing stock price and multiple unsuccessful bids to buy the company and take it private from co-founder and former CEO Anne Wojcicki. Its board did not want Wojcick and found her bids wanting. Reuters said her last pitch was 41 cents a share to take the company private, which would have valued the company at just $11 million. She resigned as CEO after this bid failed.

In 2021, Forbes declared Wojcicki America’s newest “self made billionaire” after she cut a deal with Richard Branson to launch the 23andMe IPO. Now she’s posting through the collapse of her company on X.com and trying to find a way back into the business she started. “I have resigned as CEO of the company so I can be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder,” she said in a long post on X.

“What made so many of our innovations possible were the 85% of our customers who opted in to research. Thanks to them they have empowered an incredible platform for discovery,” Wojcicki said. “23andMe was not a good steward of that data,” Wojcicki said in her post.

Which is true. Under Wojcicki’s tenure, 23andMe were bad stewards of people’s data. The company launched in 2006 and became a sensation after Oprah added one of its genetic testing kits to her list of “favorite things.” The pitch was simple: 23andMe would take a swab of your data and tell you about your genetics, including your propensity towards certain diseases and possible ancestors. 23andMe’s fortunes soured in 2023 after a hacker breached its servers and exposed the genetic data of 6.9 million customers.

The company didn’t handle it well. First it said that only 14,000 people had been exposed before it copped to the much larger number. Then it changed its terms of service on the sly in an attempt to dump angry customers into a mass arbitration process. In the end it agreed to pay a $30 million settlement and foot the bill for credit monitoring of the millions of people it exposed.

“Our foundation was the trust and respect of our customers, and they were always the guiding light on how we made decisions,” Wojcicki said in her post on X Monday morning. The data breach eroded that trust. The foundation was ruined. Throughout 2023 and 2024, 23andMe’s stock price tumbled and at the end of 2024 it laid off 200 employees. The layoffs deepened concerns that it could keep people’s genetic information safe and that it had a path of making money at all.

One of Wojcicki’s proposed solutions to turning the company around was bullying users into allowing their genetic data to be used for scientific research. “We now have the ability to mine the dataset for ourselves, as well as to partner with other groups,” the former CEO told Wired in 2024. It was a profound misreading of the moment.

“We have had many successes but I equally take accountability for the challenges we have today,” Wojcicki said on X after she resigned. “There is no doubt that the challenges faced by 23andMe through an evolving business model have been real, but my belief in the company and its future is unwavering. Consumers are rising up and asking for more control over their health and want greater knowledge about how to be healthy and why they may have health issues.”

She’s right, consumers are rising up and taking control over their health. One of the ways they’re doing it is by kicking gimmick genetic testing services like 23andMe out of their life. The truth is there’s not much the service can tell you. A complete genetic panel requires an in-depth screening of your entire family. Thanksgiving is hard enough without trying to get your uncle to spit into a tube.

After 23andMe and similar services hit the market, a lot of people got the tests done so they could learn more about their ethnic backgrounds. Americans wanted to know if the stories about being one-sixth Cherokee were true and they had found a test that could tell them. But once the test had been paid for, what else did 23andMe have?

It attempted to sell a subscription service that cost $1,188 a year. A cheaper version of the plan cost $298 up front and just $69 a year. But consumers weren’t buying and the data breach moved some of them to delete their account and reconsider what personal data they gave to the company.

With Wojcicki out, CFO Joe Selsavage is taking over to see the company through its bankruptcy. It got $35 million in financing to help it through the process and listed its assets and liabilities between $100 million and $500 million. It’s impossible to know what will happen to the data of the millions of people who swabbed a cheek and sent in a sample. So, again, it’s time to delete your data.

“If I am fortunate enough to secure the company’s assets through the restructuring process, I remain committed to our long-term vision of being a global leader in genetics and establishing genetics as a fundamental part of healthcare ecosystems worldwide,” Wojcicki said on X, perhaps misreading the moment once again.",techmeme
https://theverge.com,X’s head of engineering is out,https://theverge.com/twitter/634833/x-head-engineering-leaves-elon-musk,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 19:32:25 GMT","is a senior AI reporter working with The Verge’s policy and tech teams. She previously worked at Fortune Magazine and Business Insider.

X’s director of engineering, Haofei Wang, has suddenly left the company, according to sources with knowledge of the matter.

Wang first joined Elon Musk’s X in July 2023 and has been an integral part of the company’s leadership, often serving as a conduit between Musk and the rest of the company’s engineers. More recently, he was seen internally as X’s defacto head of engineering and product, especially with Musk recently focusing more of his time on xAI and DOGE. It’s unclear why Wang is departing now. Neither he nor a company spokesperson responded to a request for comment in time for publication.

X recently added other engineering leadership: Mike Dalton and Uday Ruddaraju, both previously technical leads at Robinhood, joined in January. Their LinkedIn profiles show that they also work at xAI, which has become increasingly intertwined with X over the last year.

Do you work at X or xAI? I’d love to chat. You can reach me securely on Signal @kylie.01 or via email at kylie@theverge.com.

Thanks to the growing profile of xAI and Musk’s newfound political influence, X’s business appears to be turning around. The company reportedly just obtained a $44 billion valuation from investors — the same price Musk paid for Twitter in 2022. While Musk remains an avid poster on X, his attention and leadership at X has become increasingly split since he started campaigning for President Donald Trump last summer.",theverge
https://theverge.com,Apple’s AirPods Max with USB-C will soon support lossless audio,https://theverge.com/news/634506/apple-airpods-max-lossless-audio-low-latency-usb-c,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 13:18:11 GMT","is a senior reviewer who has worked at The Verge since its founding in 2011. His coverage areas include audio (Sonos, Apple, Bose, Sony, etc.), home theater, smartphones, photography, and more.

Apple is bringing higher-fidelity audio to its AirPods Max headphones in April, the company announced today. When the $549 headphones switched to a USB-C connector last year, they lost support for wired audio playback — but Apple is about to rectify that with full lossless support, which even the prior Lightning model technically lacked.

“With the included USB-C cable, users can enjoy the highest-quality audio across music, movies, and games, while music creators can experience significant enhancements to songwriting, beat making, production, and mixing,” the company wrote in a press release on Monday. “With this update, AirPods Max will unlock 24-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio, preserving the integrity of original recordings and allowing listeners to experience music the way the artist created it in the studio.” Lossless support “extends to Personalized Spatial Audio,” Apple noted.

Aside from richer sound, the new update enables ultra low latency on the AirPods Max, which makes them better suited for music production, gaming, and live streaming purposes, according to the company.

The firmware update will roll out alongside iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 sometime in April. You can use a USB-C to USB-C cord for lossless audio, but Apple is also now selling a $39 USB-C to 3.5mm audio cable that shares the same braided design as its other recent cables.

The previous edition of the AirPods Max with a Lightning connector don’t offer true “lossless” playback because of a signal conversion that occurs whenever a wired audio source is used. It’s still better quality than you’d get listening over Bluetooth, however.",theverge
https://theverge.com,How to delete your 23andMe data,https://theverge.com/news/634680/23andme-genetic-data-account-deletion-how-to,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:27:26 GMT","23andMe has filed for bankruptcy, raising concerns about what will happen to the DNA-testing company and all the data it’s collected from customers over the years. In the event that 23andMe is sold, its massive genetic database may end up in the hands of a different company entirely — one that users never consented to handing their personal information over to.

If you’ve submitted your DNA to the company via its saliva-testing kits, 23andMe will typically have your genetic, ancestry, and family connections data on file, alongside any personal information that was used to create your account, including your name, address, email address, and payment information. Thankfully, the company will continue its regular operations while going through the Chapter 11 process, allowing users to access and at least partially delete their information for now.

23andMe says that genetic data is anonymized and stored separately from personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, and payment information. Anonymization has been known to fail in other situations, however, so here’s how you can proactively remove as much of your data as possible if you’d rather not take any chances. The process is the same across both mobile and desktop platforms.

How to remove your data from 23andMe

Log into 23andMe and select the “Settings” option under your account profile. Scroll down to the section titled “23andMe Data” and click “View.”

You’ll find this section at the bottom of the settings page. Image: 23andMe / The Verge

You will now be asked to verify your age for security purposes. Once that’s been submitted, the next screen will provide options that will allow you to download your data, alongside a button to request the deletion of your 23andMe account.

The age verification request should appear on both mobile and desktop versions of the platform. Image: 23andMe / The Verge

You will then receive an email from 23andMe asking you to confirm the account deletion request.

Deleting your 23andMe account is irreversible, and you’ll permanently lose access to it once completed. If there are multiple profiles created by other users on your account then those will also be wiped unless you transfer them to an account that isn’t being deleted.

One of the notable issues is that this process also won’t delete all of your data — according to 23andMe’s privacy disclosure, your genetic information, date of birth, and sex will be retained for an undisclosed amount of time to comply with the company’s legal obligations, alongside “limited information related to your account,” such as your email address and communications around your data deletion request.

23andMe did not answer our questions regarding what specific data actually is retained or deleted when a user removes their account. Some posts have appeared online that encourage 23andMe users to scramble their data before deletion by replacing things like name, date of birth, ethnicity, sex marker, and height with false equivalents. This will supposedly render any information that is retained useless, but will likely be ineffective if 23andMe only stores the data that was used to create your account — something that the company also did not clarify to The Verge.

As part of the account deletion process, 23andMe will destroy the genetic sample you submitted if you previously opted for it to remain in storage. Your 23andMe data will still exist in any scientific studies you consented to, but won’t be used in any future research projects. 23andMe directs customers who run into issues with the account deletion process to contact customercare@23andme.com for further assistance.",theverge
https://theverge.com,Apple’s The Studio spins Hollywood chaos into comedic gold,https://theverge.com/tv-reviews/627183/the-studio-review-seth-rogen-apple,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 15:50:00 GMT","is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.

The Studio, Apple TV Plus’ brilliant new comedy from co-creators Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Peter Huyck, Alex Gregory, and Frida Perez, is painfully aware of how ridiculous Hollywood and its heavyweights can seem to the public. This is especially true at a time when fans often like to fancy themselves as armchair executives who understand the business from top to bottom. With its joke-dense story about a legacy studio struggling to survive and a massive cast of celebrity guest stars playing themselves, The Studio easily could have wound up being undercooked and overstuffed. But unlike some of Apple’s other recent attempts at comedy, The Studio is a knockout — one that never seems interested in pulling its punches as it pokes fun at the current state of the entertainment industry.

The Studio revolves around Matt Remick (Rogen), an affable film buff who has parlayed his love for the medium into a successful career at Continental Studios. Even though Continental isn’t in the business of making the kinds of thought-provoking, auteur-driven projects Matt loves, he’s happy just to be part of the larger moviemaking process.

Matt’s relatively content working alongside his whip-smart assistant Quinn Hackett (Chase Sui Wonders), Continental’s bro-y vice president of production Sal Saperstein (Ike Barinholtz), and trendy marketing head Maya Mason (Kathryn Hahn). But when word gets out that the studio’s eccentric CEO Griffin Mill (Bryan Cranston) is planning to step down and pick a successor, Matt and all of his fellow execs recognize the moment as being primed for some corporate ladder-climbing.

Matt’s longtime working relationship with his mentor Patty Leigh (Catherine O’Hara) is one of the factors that puts him toward the top of Mills’ short list of people well-suited to lead Continental into the future. What really secures the new gig for Matt, though, is the speed with which he agrees that Griffin’s plan to produce a big budget movie about the Kool-Aid man is a good idea that will bolster Continental’s bottom line.

While The Studio leads with an absurdity that grows increasingly more intense as the season progresses, it never suggests that Matt is anything but genuine in his desire to make Good Movies™. Matt has enough sense to understand that, out of all the different kinds of branded IP that Continental could pour money into, powdered drink mixes don’t lend themselves to cinematic adaptations. But he’s also a people-pleaser of the highest order. And he figures that, with the right script and creative team attached to it, the Kool-Aid man’s story could be spun into a prestigious piece of award-winning cinema.

That bright (read: ridiculous) idea is part of how The Studio introduces one of the first of its many celebrity guest cameos — Olivia Wilde, Anthony Mackie, and Ron Howard are just a few who appear as heightened versions of themselves — that help make the show play like a smart and self-aware send up of contemporary Hollywood. Everyone feels like they’re in on the joke as the Kool-Aid project becomes attached to respected directors like Martin Scorsese, who just wants to make a serious drama about the Jonestown massacre. But the show’s funniest moments are borne out of the way Matt’s earnest desire to be seen as an artist rather than a stuffy money guy inspires him to become over-involved on the sets of Continental’s various mid-production projects.

Apple

Rogen, who co-directs each of The Studio’s 10 episodes with Goldberg, is obviously having a ball as Matt’s quest to put Continental on top while snuffing out fires of his own making transforms the show into a series of tributes to Hollywood classics. When an important film reel goes missing from a set, The Studio becomes a Chinatown-esque noir with Matt at its center as a makeshift hardboiled detective narrating his search into a voice memo on his phone.

It’s always clear that Matt has far more pressing matters he should be attending to — for example, the Continental team calls an emergency meeting at one point to figure out whether casting a Black actor to voice the Kool-Aid man is racist — instead of trying to ingratiate himself to celebrities like Greta Lee, who just wants to get their movies over the finish line. But in addition to helping, you understand how much of a well-meaning workaholic Matt is. His insistence on constantly being in the mix sets The Studio up to work as an in-depth look at how the cinematic sausage gets made.

Even as it’s inviting you to laugh at Hollywood types for being so extra, you can see The Studio being thoughtfully reflective about the very real work it takes to make movies feel magical. And at a time when Amazon can drop a few billion dollars to buy James Bond, and Netflix can brag about how many people are (supposedly) watching a movie that plays like it was cooked up by an iffy algorithm, The Studio’s madness doesn’t seem all that farfetched.

https://theverge.com,Microsoft announces security AI agents to help overwhelmed humans,https://theverge.com/news/634598/microsoft-security-copilot-ai-agents,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:00:00 GMT","is a senior editor and author of Notepad , who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.

Microsoft launched its AI-powered Security Copilot a year ago to bring a chatbot to the cybersecurity space, and now it’s expanding it with AI agents that are designed to autonomously assist overwhelmed security teams. Microsoft is unveiling six of its own AI agents for its Security Copilot, as well as five that have been created by its partners.

Microsoft’s six security agents will be available in preview next month, and are designed to do things like triage and process phishing and data loss alerts, prioritize critical incidents, and monitor for vulnerabilities. “The six Microsoft Security Copilot agents enable teams to autonomously handle high-volume security and IT tasks while seamlessly integrating with Microsoft Security solutions,“ says Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security.

Microsoft is also working with OneTrust, Aviatrix, BlueVoyant, Tanium, and Fletch to enable some third-party security agents. These extensions will make it easier to analyze data breaches with OneTrust or perform root cause analysis of network outages and failures with Aviatrix.

AI agents are becoming an increasingly popular way for companies like Microsoft to sell businesses on AI tools. Microsoft relaunched its Copilot for businesses earlier this year with free AI chat and access to pay-as-you-go AI agents.

While these latest AI agents in the Security Copilot are designed for security teams to take advantage of, Microsoft is also improving its phishing protection in Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 will start protecting Teams users against phishing and other cyberthreats within Teams next month, including better protection against malicious URLs and attachments.

Microsoft also has a lot of other industry-specific security announcements today and at its upcoming Microsoft Secure event on April 9th. You can read more about them over at Microsoft’s security blog.",theverge

The $129.99 anamorphic lens uses an optical squishing technique to shoot in a 21:9 aspect ratio and capture cinematic-style lens flares, with the Hero 13 Black automatically switching to the corresponding camera mode when it detects the lens has been attached.

The Verge’s Vjeran Pavic has had some time to play with the anamorphic lens mod. He’s detailed his initial feelings below alongside some example footage he’s captured during testing.

First impressions

Hey, Vjeran here. The more I’ve used the anamorphic lens mode, the more I understood its appeal. It’s a fun way to modify your GoPro footage and give them a fresh look. I can see it being a very popular way to add a cinematic look to your FPV drone footage or a new perspective to your action sports clips. I’ve used mine for skateboarding, driving clips and walks on the beach with my dog.

The lens is a bit larger than your other attachments and adds a bit of weight to your GoPro, but not to the point where it would bother me. The front glass element is exposed, so be careful not to damage it. I haven’t had any issues, but I was very careful to cover the lens with the included lens cap when storing it away.

I was very glad to see that the lens mod is also compatible with many of GoPro’s filming modes. You can film in 5.3K up to 60fps and 4K up to 120fps for slow motion clips. I, a videography nerd, was also happy to see you can film in GP-Log in 10-bit. There are no real “gotcha” moments here like there were when the first Max Mod came out with the GoPro Hero 11.

There are two things I wish were better. One of those isn’t a mod issue, but an overall GoPro issue. It was never good at lowlight and that’s where the anamorphic lenses are the most fun. And second, I have noticed that it is a bit on the softer side when you have something close to the lens.",theverge

Today, Disney+ is releasing a much-anticipated global update to its “Continue Watching” set, allowing users to easily remove titles from the row. Whether you’ve already finished a title, added something by accident, or simply want a reset, we’ve got you covered.

Where can you find these updates? Here’s what you need to know on how to remove titles from the “Continue Watching” row:

How can I remove something I’ve already watched from the “Continue Watching” row on my TV?

This depends on where you’re removing it from. Within the “Continue Watching” row itself, you’ll need to navigate to the title you want, press and hold the button on your remote to remove, and then select Remove.

However, if you are on the title’s Details page, simply navigate to the Remove icon on the right side and select Remove. Rest assured though, your watch progress will not be deleted, even if removed from the “Continue Watching” row.

What if I’m on a mobile device or on the web?

The experience on both mobile and web are similar. From the “Continue Watching” row on mobile, navigate to the tile and tap the three dots, then select Remove. On the web, place your cursor over the tile and click the Remove icon from the top right corner to clear a title from “Continue Watching.”

Why am I not seeing this feature on my device?

This update will be available on the web, Apple TV, and iOS devices starting today, with a rollout to additional platforms in the coming weeks.

Why am I seeing titles in my “Continue Watching” row that I’ve never watched?

This often happens when other members of your household stream on your profile. The easiest way to keep this row organized with the titles most relevant to you is by ensuring that everyone has their own profile. Creating and switching profiles on Disney+ is easy — check out these simple instructions! Each Disney+ account can have up to seven profiles, so everyone in your household can have a Disney+ experience that’s all theirs.

Interested in sharing your account with someone outside your household? With Paid Sharing on Disney+, you can add one Extra Member to your account for an additional fee. Alternatively, you can transfer an eligible profile to someone that wants to create their own account.

Is there anything else I should know?

So imagine the feeling of sticker shock (complimentary) to spot one of Alienware’s models with a fast 360Hz refresh rate for hundreds of dollars off, which is the case right now at Dell’s website.

Originally $899.99, this monitor’s final price plunges to $599.99 when you use promo code AW27300 at checkout. With tax, my checkout total rang up to a cool $653.24. An OLED gaming monitor that costs less than a mid-range GPU? Hell yeah. At this price, there’s no need to wait for Alienware’s forthcoming AW2725D, which the company hopes (but isn’t promising) to launch for $549. It’ll have 1440p resolution with a 280Hz refresh rate, so it’s actually slower than Alienware’s discounted AW2725DF.

In terms of the specs, Alienware’s 27-inch AW2725DF sports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, plus support for VRR via either its HDMI 2.1 port or through either of its DisplayPort 1.4 ports. That’ll ensure that the screen looks smooth and tear-free, even during moments when the frame rate fluctuates wildly. While the panel can achieve up to a 360Hz refresh rate — equating to 360 visible frames per second, if your GPU can keep up — it’s only supported via the DisplayPort. Through HDMI 2.1, the monitor’s refresh rate tops out at a respectable 144Hz.

The AW2725DF has an anti-reflective coating, but since I haven’t used this exact display, I can’t vouch as to whether it’s fully matte or slightly on the glossy side (the newer AW2725Q is more glossy than matte, in turn letting more contrast through). It has 111 pixels per inch (PPI), which should be enough clarity to avoid seeing pixelated text. A low PPI dampened my enthusiasm for other OLED monitors, including the Corsair Xeneon Flex that I reviewed in late 2022.",theverge

Google has officially launched its Drive app for Arm-compatible Windows PCs. It first rolled out the Arm64 app in beta last year, but now it’s “generally available,” according to an update posted Monday.

Like the existing Google Drive app, the Arm64 version lets Windows PCs running Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors store, sync, and access files. The app is only available on devices with Windows 11 and Microsoft WebView 2, which Google says is “typically included” with Windows 11.

https://theverge.com,Google Photos will still auto-sync with Aura photo frames after all,https://theverge.com/tech/634673/google-photos-aura-digital-photo-frame-auto-sync-fix,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:10:33 GMT","is a deputy editor with 18 years of experience writing and editing product reviews, gadgets and business news. Previously, he was a deputy editor covering technology companies at CNBC.

We reported earlier this month that, due to changes Google is making to how apps access Google Photo libraries, digital photo frames from companies like Aura and Cozyla would no longer be able to auto-sync with those albums. But Aura has now confirmed to The Verge that its frames will continue to work with Google Photos.

“We are working with Google to maintain auto-add for Google Photos on Aura,” company spokesperson Jenisse Curry said. “While we previously announced that this feature will be removed, it will now continue.”

Curry added that syncing will continue as usual for now and that owners of its frames won’t need to take any additional action, but that the company will “share additional information when ready.”

Aura’s cloud-connected frames allow you and others to view shared photos. As with Google’s Nest displays, for example, you could gift an Aura photo frame to a grandparent and then automatically sync Google Photo albums of your kids so that your parents can always see fresh pictures of their grandchildren.

Sync was initially set to end on March 17th. While Aura would continue to show photos that had already been sent to the frame, auto-sync would turn off and users would have to send new pictures from the Google Photos app manually.

The Google Photos API change was announced in September and will prevent apps from accessing your entire photo library. It’s still set to go into effect on March 31st, which suggests that Aura will have instructions on how to continue auto-sync around that time.

“We’re always looking for ways to update our APIs to improve user privacy, and we have APIs specifically designed for digital photo frames and a program to help our partners update their products,” Google spokesperson Colin Smith told The Verge earlier this month.

A Cozyla spokesperson wasn’t immediately available to comment on whether the company will also continue to support auto-sync.",theverge

The rejection was due to the argument that buying power directly instead of getting it through the grid like everyone else works against the interests of other users.

Demand for power in the US has been flat for nearly 20 years. “But now we’re seeing load forecasts shooting up. Depending on [what] numbers you want to accept, they’re either skyrocketing or they’re just rapidly increasing,” said Mark Christie, a FERC commissioner.

Part of the surge in demand comes from data centers, and their increasing thirst for power comes in part from running increasingly sophisticated AI models. As with all world-shaping developments, what set this trend into motion was vision—quite literally.

The AlexNet moment

Back in 2012, Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton, AI researchers at the University of Toronto, were busy working on a convolution neural network (CNN) for the ImageNet LSRVC, an image-recognition contest. The contest’s rules were fairly simple: A team had to build an AI system that could categorize images sourced from a database comprising over a million labeled pictures.

The task was extremely challenging at the time, so the team figured they needed a really big neural net—way bigger than anything other research teams had attempted. AlexNet, named after the lead researcher, had multiple layers, with over 60 million parameters and 650 thousand neurons. The problem with a behemoth like that was how to train it.

What the team had in their lab were a few Nvidia GTX 580s, each with 3GB of memory. As the researchers wrote in their paper, AlexNet was simply too big to fit on any single GPU they had. So they figured out how to split AlexNet’s training phase between two GPUs working in parallel—half of the neurons ran on one GPU, and the other half ran on the other GPU.",arstechnica

The question is, will this significantly degrade forecasts in the United States and around the world?

On February 27, it was announced that balloon launches would be suspended entirely at Kotzebue, Alaska, due to staffing shortages. In early March, Albany, N.Y., and Gray, Maine, announced periodic disruptions in launches. Since March 7, it appears that Gray has not missed any balloon launches through Saturday. Albany, however, has missed 14 of them, all during the morning launch cycle (12z).

The kicker came on Thursday afternoon when it was announced that all balloon launches would be suspended in Omaha, Neb., and Rapid City, S.D., due to staffing shortages. Additionally, the balloon launches in Aberdeen, S.D.; Grand Junction, Colo.; Green Bay, Wis.; Gaylord, Mich.; North Platte, Neb.; and Riverton, Wyo., would be reduced to once a day from twice a day.

What are weather balloons?

In a normal time, weather balloons would be launched across the country and world twice per day, right at about 8 am ET and 8 pm ET (one hour earlier in winter), or what we call 12z and 00z. That’s Zulu time, or noon and midnight in Greenwich, England. Rather than explain the whole reasoning behind why we use Zulu time in meteorology, here’s a primer on everything you need to know. Weather balloons are launched around the world at the same time. It’s a unique collaboration and example of global cooperation in the sciences, something that has endured for many years.

These weather balloons are loaded up with hydrogen or helium, soar into the sky, up to and beyond jet stream level, getting to a height of over 100,000 feet before they pop. Attached to the weather balloon is a tool known as a radiosonde, or ""sonde"" for short. This is basically a weather-sensing device that measures all sorts of weather variables like temperature, dewpoint, pressure, and more. Wind speed is usually derived from this based on GPS transmitting from the sonde.",arstechnica

The vote behind closed doors was 4–1, with three Democrats and Republican Hester Peirce joining to support the lawsuit over Musk's late disclosure of a Twitter stock purchase in early 2022, Reuters reported today. The one dissent reportedly came from Republican Mark Uyeda, who was subsequently named acting SEC chairman by Trump.

Uyeda also asked SEC enforcement staff ""to declare that a case they wanted to bring against Elon Musk was not motivated by politics, an unusual request that the staffers refused,"" Bloomberg reported last month. Reuters said its sources confirmed that ""staff refused to sign the pledge, as it is not typical SEC practice.""

Reuters reported that two of its sources ""said Uyeda and his fellow Republican Peirce took issue with what the SEC wanted Musk to pay—giving up $150 million in alleged unjust enrichment plus a penalty. Nonetheless, Peirce joined with the three Democrats in voting to sue.""

But years before that, with the 1998 launch of the original Half-Life, Valve cofounder and then-CMO Monica Harrington said she was inspired to take DRM more seriously by her nephew's reaction to the purchase of a new CD-ROM burner.

PC Gamer pulled that interesting tidbit from a talk Harrington gave at last week's Game Developers Conference. In her remembering, Harrington's nephew had used funds she had sent for school supplies on a CD replicator, then sent her ""a lovely thank you note essentially saying how happy he was to copy and share games with his friends.""

That was the moment Harrington said she realized this new technology was leading to a ""generational shift"" in both the availability and acceptability of PC game piracy. While game piracy and DRM definitely existed prior to CD burners (anyone else remember the large codewheels that cluttered many early PC game boxes?), Harrington said the new technology—and the blasé attitude her nephew showed toward using it for piracy—could ""put our entire business model at risk.""

Shortly after Half-Life launched with a simple CD key verification system in place, Harrington said the company noticed a wave of message board complaints about the game not working. But when Valve cofounder (and Monica's then-husband) Mike Harrington followed up with those complaining posters, he found that ""none of them had actually bought the game. So it turned out that the authentication system was working really well,"" Harrington said.",arstechnica

Draft standard IEEE P7012, which Searls has nicknamed ""MyTerms"" (akin to ""Wi-Fi""), is a Draft Standard for Machine Readable Personal Privacy Terms. Searls writes on his blog that MyTerms has been in the works since 2017, and a fully readable version should be ready later this year, following conference presentations at VRM Day and the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW).

The big concept is that you are the first party to each contract you have with online things. The websites, apps, or services you visit are the second party. You arrive with either a pre-set contract you prefer on your device or pick one when you arrive, and it tells the site what information you will and will not offer up for access to content or services. Presumably, a site can work with that contract, modify itself to meet the terms, or perhaps tell you it can't do that.

The easiest way to set your standards, at first, would be to pick something from Customer Commons, which is modeled on the copyleft concept of Creative Commons. Right now, there's just one example up: #NoStalking, which allows for ads but not with data usable for ""targeted advertising or tracking beyond the primary service for which you provided it."" Ad blocking is not addressed in Searls' post or IEEE summary, but it would presumably exist outside MyTerms—even if MyTerms seems to want to reduce the need for ad blocking.",arstechnica

Google recently changed the way it stored timeline data to improve privacy, but the company now confirms that a ""technical issue"" resulted in many users losing their timeline history altogether, and there might not be any way to recover it.

Timeline, previously known as Location History, is very useful if you need to figure out where you were on a particular day or if you just can't remember where you found that neat bar on your last vacation. Many Google users grew quite fond of having access to that data. However, Google had access to it, too. Starting in 2024, Google transitioned to storing Timeline data only on the user's individual smartphone instead of backing it up to the cloud. You can probably see where this is going.

Users started piping up over the past several weeks, posting on the Google support forums, Reddit, and other social media that their treasured Timeline data had gone missing. Google has been investigating the problem, and the news isn't good. In an email sent out over the weekend, Google confirmed what many already feared: Maps has accidentally deleted Timeline data on countless devices.

A Google spokesperson confirmed this is the result of a technical issue and not user error or an intentional change. It's unclear how this happened, but we'd wager on a botched Maps update. Google usually rolls out updates in waves, and it's possible that the defective build in this case made it to a large number of devices before it was stopped.

You have exactly one possible fix for this issue, but only if you planned ahead. When Google began the full change-over to local storage of Timeline data, it added several settings to control the feature. While the data is stored locally by default, you have the option of creating encrypted backups in the cloud. If you did that, you should be able to restore the data.",arstechnica

Once out in the countryside, skyscrapers are starting to fill in the backdrop behind the Shanghai International Circuit. One of the mid-2000s crop of race tracks designed by Hermann Tilke, it's characterized by the neverending decreasing radii that are turns 1 and 2, plus the longest straight on the calendar. It was freshly resurfaced for this year, eliminating the bumps and increasing the grip level to fix a botched job performed ahead of last year's F1 race.

China was home to the first sprint weekend of the year, with a 19-lap race on Saturday in place of that morning's practice session ahead of the 56-lap race on Sunday. Lewis Hamilton, now clad in bright Ferrari red, led from start to finish, showing the kind of ability that has led him to 105 race wins. Hamilton's last year with Mercedes was better than the winless 2022 and 2023, but his new Ferrari already appears to suit him better.

This was very much the high point of Ferrari's weekend.

Red Bull, by comparison, has not built a car that suits its drivers well.

The company has been losing money for years, and a conflict between its board and CEO about future directions led to the entire board resigning back in September. Said CEO, Anne Wojcicki, has now resigned and will be pursuing an attempt to purchase the company and take it private.

At stake is the fate of genetic data from the company's 15 million customers. The company has secured enough funding to continue operations while a buyer is found, and even though US law limits how genetic data can be used, the pending sale has raised significant privacy concerns.

Risky business

The company launched around the time that ""gene chips"" first allowed people to broadly scan the human genome for sites where variations were common. A few of these variants are associated with diseases, and 23andMe received approval to test for a number of these. But its big selling point for many people was the opportunity to explore their heritage. This relied on looking broadly at the patterns of variation and comparing those to the patterns typically found in different geographic regions. It's an imperfect analysis, but it can often provide a decent big-picture resolution of a person's ancestry.

23andMe faced a number of challenges, though. For starters, the gene chips quickly became commodities, allowing a large range of competitors to enter the field, some of which had stronger backgrounds in things like linking genealogies to public records. This commodification also meant that many potential 23andMe partners in the pharmaceutical industry, who might be interested in gene/disease linkages, could affordably build their own databases or simply rely on some of the public resources that have since been developed, like the UK's Biobank.",arstechnica

Ars does not accept paid editorial content.

Badging on the rear of the new Cadillac Optiq may confuse some American buyers. This crossover is fully electric, so the alphanumeric nomenclature can't refer to engine displacement—and not horsepower, either. Instead, 500E4 refers to 500 Newton-meters of torque, the metric units for more familiar pound-feet, plus dual-motor all-wheel drive. Rating the Optiq's output in kilowatts might have at least rendered something at least somewhat more comprehensible, but the designation hints at the Optiq's intended global market, which in turn reveals just how important this crossover EV is for Cadillac's future.

The Optiq slots in as an upmarket variant of the Chevrolet Equinox EV, featuring a suite of enhancements unveiled at a Downtown Los Angeles preview last spring. With the exterior design, interior materials, and tech features all known quantities, I arrived to a drive program held in the San Francisco Bay Area—concurrently with the Escalade IQ—more curious to experience how much the Optiq's additional power and refinement can possibly improve on the already solid Equinox.

On paper, the Caddy bests its Chevy counterpart despite using much of the same hardware. In this case, an 85-kilowatt-hour battery allows for an EPA-estimated range of 302 miles (486 km) despite output from dual motors matching the AWD Equinox at 300 hp (223 kW), just with a bit more in the torque department at 354 lb-ft (almost, but not quite, that 500Nm figure).

The Optiq also weighs 5,192 pounds (2,355 kg) despite a diminutive footprint, proportions which a low and raked windshield angle only help to emphasize (in addition to improving aerodynamic drag). But in practice, the major mechanical difference between the Equinox and Optiq comes down to suspension tuning. Cadillac's marketing materials highlight both the luxury and sporty spirit of this crossover, and the shock dampers needed to live up to those somewhat divergent goals.",arstechnica

The FBI issued a public service announcement Friday about attacks against Tesla dealerships, asking the public to be vigilant in the wake of at least nine known incidents where people have shot up unoccupied Tesla vehicles and tossed molotov cocktails at empty buildings. Another incident Monday included suspected incendiary devices found at a dealership in Austin, according to KXAN.

The FBI statement is an unsurprising development, but Attorney General Pam Bondi really ratcheted up the rhetoric on Sunday when she appeared on Fox News to claim the people committing these attacks had “weapons of mass destruction.”

“These are not isolated incidents, as you know, and these aren’t vandals,” Bondi told Maria Bartiromo. “These are Molotov cocktails. That could be a weapon of mass destruction that they’re throwing in Tesla dealerships.”

The term “weapon of mass destruction” is defined on the Department of Homeland Security’s website as a “nuclear, radiological, chemical, biological, or other device that is intended to harm a large number of people.” And if you wanted to stretch, you could probably make a case that a molotov cocktail falls under the definition of WMDs because there are so many different ways to define the term under domestic terrorism laws, even if most people commonly understand WMDs to be things like nuclear weapons and mustard gas.

But whatever the technical definition, the intent by Bondi here is clear. She wants to use the same playbook used after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, to instill fear in the population and justify an overwhelming response. Back in 2002, it was claims that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had WMDs that somehow threatened the U.S. Today, it’s supposed WMDs against Elon Musk’s businesses.

Hussein had no such weapons, of course, but it was the lie President George W. Bush used to justify the invasion of Iraq in early 2003, starting a war that most Americans recognize today as unnecessary. It was a lie that worked, unfortunately, and that kind of fearmongering succeeds because the general public typically thinks mass casualty events are the kind of thing that warrant a serious response.

And Attorney General Bondi is clearly cooking up a huge response, since she also took it a step further on Fox News and suggested that Jasmine Crockett, an outspoken Democratic congresswoman from Texas, was somehow tied to “domestic terrorism.”

“This is domestic terrorism,” Bondi said. “And Maria, now you have this congresswoman Crockett, who is calling for attacks on Elon Musk on her birthday. Let’s take him out on my birthday, she says. Yet she turns and says, oh, I’m not calling for violence. Well, she is an elected public official. And so she needs to tread very carefully, because nothing will happen to Elon Musk, and we’re going to fight to protect all of the Tesla owners throughout this country. And it’s basic safety. Once again, domestic terrorism is going to come to a stop in our country.”

Crockett hit back at Bondi’s accusations on MSNBC, telling host Alex Witt on Sunday that she doesn’t promote violence while noting President Trump’s pardons of violent offenders who tried to overthrow the U.S. government on January 6, 2021.

“I have never promoted violence whatsoever, yet I’ve also never made excuse for those violent actors such as the ones on January 6,” Crockett said, according to the Daily Beast. “So Pam Bondi, if you have an issue with terrorism, maybe you should talk to your boss about locking back up those guys that he let out that participated in January 6.”

The property destruction at Tesla dealerships is getting most of the headlines, but there are also entirely peaceful protests against Musk that are getting far less attention. Dubbed Tesla Takedown, protests have popped up at nearly every Tesla dealership across the country over the past two months. Protesters are upset with Musk’s destruction of the U.S. government, something that’s ongoing as his DOGE goons go from agency to agency slashing and burning things, often without understanding what they’re obliterating.

Musk wasn’t elected nor was he confirmed as a cabinet official, and yet he’s operating like a kind of co-president to Trump. Musk has repeatedly suggested that he alone should get to decide what’s worthy of funding, even if Congress very famously has the power of the purse. Musk is destroying entire agencies, as he did with USAID, despite the fact that Congress is the only entity which can legally do something so drastic.

Supporters of Trump and Musk have also made appearances at these anti-Tesla protests, including one guy who attempted to use a stun gun against peaceful protesters in Berkeley, California, over the weekend.

Another incident saw a man in Palm Beach, Florida, intentionally drive his SUV at a crowd of protesters, apparently in an attempt to defend Musk’s honor or something. The crowd jumped out of the way and no one was hurt, according to Florida’s Local 10 news outlet.

The protests are likely to continue into the future, as elected Democrats like senate minority leader Chuck Schumer refuse to stand up to Musk and Trump in any meaningful way. Schumer voted to advance the Republican funding bill two weeks ago and got nothing in return, something even Nancy Pelosi pointed out as ridiculous. And until elected leaders like Schumer start acting like we’re living through an emergency, protests at Tesla dealerships are the only option many Americans feel like they have to express their disgust.

Trump and his band of malcontents also insist that he’s going to go after the “funders” of the attacks on Tesla dealerships, despite the fact that the FBI has described them as almost certainly “lone offenders.”

https://gizmodo.com,Scientists Find Giant Organic Molecules on Mars as Old as Life on Earth,https://gizmodo.com/scientists-find-giant-organic-molecules-on-mars-as-old-as-life-on-earth-2000579710,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 19:00:09 GMT","A team of scientists just discovered the longest organic molecules yet seen on Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun and and a tantalizing venue for humankind’s search for life beyond Earth.

Mars today is inhospitable, with significant temperature fluctuations, a thin atmosphere, and an apparent dearth of liquid water on the planet’s surface. But according to new research, published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, large molecules found on Mars apparently are as old as life on Earth, raising questions about biological activity on an ancient Mars.

The molecules are long carbon chains, containing up to 12 consecutive carbon atoms. The molecules sat preserved on Mars for about 3.7 billion years, undisturbed by geological activity, moisture, or heat. The molecules date to about the same time as the earliest-known signs of life on our planet.

Curiosity has roved Mars for years, revealing new details of the planet’s ancient environment. Key to that environment is carbon, an element that is both vital to life and useful for bonding molecules, including DNA and RNA. According to a French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) release, the carbon chains “could exhibit features similar to the fatty acids produced on Earth by biological activity.”

The discovery of these organic molecules offers crucial insights into potential biological processes on early Mars, but to be clear, it’s not evidence of past or present life. What it does tell us, however, is that the building blocks necessary for life as we know it were present—and that Mars may once have had the right conditions to support it.

“Although the source of these organic molecules on Mars could not be established in this study, these organics could have either been formed by geological processes on Mars (non-biological chemical reactions such as from hydrothermal activity), they were delivered to the surface of Mars from meteorites, or they are the organic remnants of an ancient martian biology,” said Daniel Glavin, a senior scientist for sample return at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and co-author of the paper, in an email to Gizmodo.

The team, which included scientists with CNRS and several other institutions, made its findings using the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) laboratory aboard Curiosity. SAM contains a gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer, which make it possible to identify isolated molecules in samples collected by the rover. Curiosity has seen organic matter in Martian mudstones before, but the new research describes the longest chains yet identified. Finding long carbon chains on Mars is significant because it shows that NASA scientists are on the right track in the way that they search for signs of life—or at least, the things that undergird life on Earth.

Curiosity is still going strong, but successors in its mission of understanding Mars’ ancient past are already on the way. ESA’s ExoMars mission, set to launch in 2028, and the joint NASA-ESA Mars Sample Return mission will help scientists better assess Mars’ composition in the ancient past—and by proxy, the potential of ancient life on its surface.

“The discovery of long-chain hydrocarbons that were preserved (and not completely destroyed by exposure to ionizing radiation) in ancient sedimentary rocks on Mars, bolsters the current strategy of searching for ancient signs of life in the martian near-surface that may share similar characteristics with life on Earth,” Glavin added. “From the analysis of meteorites and samples returned from asteroids Bennu and Ryugu by the OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa2 missions, we know that the chemical building blocks of life that include amino acids (used to form proteins), carboxylic acids (used in cell membranes) and nucleobases (components of DNA and RNA) were widespread throughout the solar system and these chemical building blocks would have been delivered to Mars.”

“But the million-dollar question is: Did the life forming organic chemistry required to go from these basic chemical building blocks to larger and more complex structures like proteins and nucleic acids found in cells ever occur on Mars?,” Glavin added.

Liquid water once existed in vast reservoirs and lakes on Mars. Now long dried up, space agency rovers are tasked with exploring those once-wet environs, seeking signs of primordial life similar to those which eke out existence in Earth’s wetter climes. Scientists have seen signs of liquid water beneath the Martian surface, though such speculative findings will require more scrutiny before scientists can say for sure.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,"A Populist Influencer Is Running for Congress, and She Actually Understands YouTube",https://gizmodo.com/a-populist-influencer-is-running-for-congress-and-actually-understands-youtube-2000579826,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:05:18 GMT","Journalist and influencer Kat Abughazaleh announced she’s running for Congress in a YouTube video. In a video that looked more like a livestream than an announcement of a bid for office, Abughazaleh promised to run a transparent campaign, fight for affordable groceries, and stand up to authoritarians.

Abughazaleh is running in Illinois’ 9th district, which covers the north side of Chicago and some of its suburbs. She’ll attempt to unseat Democratic incumbent and party stalwart Jan Schakowsky, who is 81 and has held her seat since 1999.

“I say it’s time to drop the excuses and grow a fucking spine,” Abughazaleh said in her announcement video. “We need a vision that’s bigger than what we’ve been told is possible. There is absolutely no reason you shouldn’t be able to afford housing, groceries, and healthcare with some money leftover. Families should have free childcare. Social security should be expanded, and our inalienable rights shouldn’t be dependent on who’s in power. That means standing up to authoritarians, not shrinking away when the fight gets tough.”

It’s obvious the video was made for a young audience by a person who grew up using social media. It’s got the aesthetic of a streamer: complete with floating mic arm, clear and focused high quality camera, baked in subtitles, and competent editing that helped Abughazaleh emphasize her points.

Abughazaleh has been making videos online for years. She worked for Media Matters where she critiqued and dissected right wing media and talking points. She’s also produced videos for Mother Jones.

In 2023, Media Matters published an investigation revealing how advertisers on X often had content appear next to Nazi propaganda. Advertisers fled the platform. Musk sued the company for defamation in Texas and the case is still ongoing. The company then laid off staff, including Abughazaleh, saying it couldn’t pay its legal bills and its workers at the same time.

In her Congressional announcement, Abughazaleh said she knew how to fight people like Musk. “Just a few months ago, Elon Musk’s lawyers deposed me here in Chicago to ask about my mean tweets,” she said. In the months after leaving Media Matters, she’s produced videos independently on YouTube and TikTok where she has 217 thousand followers.

I summarized Elon Musk’s takeover of our government in 70 seconds: pic.twitter.com/XMpCmZ7smD — Kat Abughazaleh (@abughazalehkat) February 17, 2025

When Chuck Schumer bowed to Congressional Republicans in the budget fight, he called it strategy. Constituents read it as weakness. As Musk and Trump rampage through the federal government and attack social security, voters are looking for anyone willing to fight. The Democrats, especially the old line, seem to be laying down. Even amidst a backlash against Trump, the party has seen shrinking poll numbers and increased unfavorability ratings.

“What if we didn’t suck?” Abughazaleh said in the video announcing her run. “We all deserve better. We deserve human rights and financial freedom and a party that stands up to authoritarians.”

Schakowsky has her own YouTube channel where she posts clips of her speaking on the floor of Congress, media hits, and direct-to-camera addresses to constituents. A March 13 video about her plans for the future is a striking contrast to Abughazaleh’s announcement. The color balance is off and the lighting is bad, the Capitol looms in the background, and the editing appears to cover mistakes instead helping Schakowsky emphasize her talking points. She also bragged that Rachel Maddow had mentioned her on TV.

“I was at Daley Plaza to protect science,” Schakowsky said in the video. “Rachel Maddow also mentioned that I had been there. I’m going to continue to just to show up and I would welcome you to join me. We have to be visible. We have to be loud. We have to be ready to fight.”

This isn’t the first time someone has attempted to use social media stardom to launch a political career. After years of battling toxic gamers online, game developer Brianna Wu ran for Congress in 2018 and 2020. She lost both times. In 2022, accredited physician and podcast host Sydnee McElroy successfully won the Democratic primary for a Congressional seat in West Virginia but lost the race against a Republican incumbent.

The difference here is that Wu and McElroy had other careers and used social media followings in an attempt to attain political power. Abughazaleh is a digital native who has spent years posting and fighting the ring wing online, and often winning. She’s known primarily for her political content. Time will tell if that can translate into electoral victory.

On March 6, The New York Times reported that lawmakers are scared of Trump and the online army he commands. “Every disinfo reporter/ researcher I know (including myself) has been the target of mean tweets or even legal action by Elon Musk,” Abughazaleh said in a post on BlueSky responding to the story.

“Frankly, this is a skill issue.”",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,20 Questions We Have After Severance Season 2,https://gizmodo.com/severance-season-2-spoilers-burning-questions-apple-2000577845,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:00:11 GMT","Everyone has now had a few days to sit with “Cold Harbor,” the hugely consequential season two finale of Apple TV+’s Severance. And that break is necessary because, wow. On a show known for blowing our minds the finale kind of did that, then reconstructed it, then blew it again. That goes double when you start to ponder some of the many, many questions left dangling as the credits rolled.

What follows are 20 questions we still have after the end of Severance season two. Some are serious, some are not. Some have answers, and some do not. But all should help fill that void since there are no new episodes on the immediate horizon. In fact, let’s start there and of course, beware of spoilers.

When, oh when, is season 3?

Here’s the good news. On the heels of the season two finale, Apple officially announced season three is happening. Here’s the bad news: it might take a while. No official date is set but we imagine a mid to late 2026 release is as soon as it could be considering how long it takes to make the show. Which, despite being just an educated guess, is still better than the three years between seasons one and two.

What’s going to happen to Gemma?

Season two was about a lot of things but ultimately it was about fulfilling that cliffhanger of season one, when innie Mark realized his outie’s wife is alive and at Lumon. Well, she’s out now, as long as she can make her way up the staircase without Lumon security grabbing her. If she gets free, we’re wondering if Devon and Cobel are waiting, if they’ll go to the press, how she will get her life back since the world thinks she’s dead, if that’s even possible, if she’ll return to Lumon as Ms. Casey or one of her other 24 innies, if Lumon will come after her because she’s been exposed to Cold Harbor, etc. There are so many possibilities.

Are Mark and Helly basically stuck on the severed floor?

If either of them gets on the other side of that unmistakable “ding,” their respective outies will be back in control, which will most likely mean death for both of their severed personas. Mark is going to immediately pivot back to picking up his life with Gemma; all promises to his innie aside, why would he ever go back to Lumon once he left?

As for Helly R.—Helena Eagan loathed the idea of her in the first place. She’d basically already killed her off after the end of season one, only allowing her to live again once Irving figured out her ruse, and in the interest of inspiring Mark S. to finish Cold Harbor. There’s no way she’s going to become an MDR worker bee ever again.

That doesn’t mean they both won’t be forced off the severed floor, though. You have to assume Devon and Gemma will be hellbent on getting Mark out, and Jame Eagen still has need of his heir apparent daughter (even if he doesn’t love her).

What will their outies do when they find out?

Assuming they do get out. There is a chance the innies figure out some way to endure. But, just in case, let’s say they don’t and eventually, Mark Scout and Helena Eagan get back in control. They’d likely have the knowledge that their innies are in love and basically blew up Lumon. Mark will want to see Gemma. Helena will probably want to run very, very far away from her father. And at least Mark will probably feel very guilty about it. Or maybe he won’t. He could continue with reintegration as promised, or get a better idea of what that means. Helena could kill her innie forever. Whatever the case, for our money, this is one of the most enticing things to think about moving ahead, exploring these relationships

Was Cobel being honest about the fate of the severed floor?

Cobel tells Mark that once Cold Harbor is done, he and his severed team are done too. It’s part of the reason he chooses Helly at the end, because he thinks their time is running out. But is it? Drummond certainly thought so when he was trying to kill Mark but Dylan’s outie sure still thought he had a job moving ahead. Helena Eagan clearly doesn’t want to return but there are lots of other people down there. We think Cobel was being honest about most of the things in this episode, but that MDR would be done after Cold Harbor is only partially true.

Was no one else working at Lumon?

That Lumon office building is awfully large—as its accompanying parking lot. It feels very odd then that we never really met any other employees besides the ones on the severed floor and the testing floor, and the managers and bigwigs keeping tabs on them.

At the very least, you’d think there would be more of a beefed-up presence for security guards, especially on Cold Harbor day. Mr. Drummond was a big dude, but as “Cold Harbor” clearly showed, he wasn’t big enough to prevent all kinds of chaos from erupting, or survive it.

What will Mark’s actions mean for Lumon and its employees?

Lumon is a massive company. It’s more than just “Cold Harbor” and macrodata refining. If Gemma’s story does become public, you have to assume it would be enough for law enforcement to shut down Lumon. Only, we don’t know what relationship Lumon has with most of the outside world. There are also many other employees working there in various mysterious and likely unsevered capacities. They’d probably prefer to not lose their jobs because one department did something so evil. It will be interesting to see the fallout of Gemma’s escape.

Are the goats safe now?

Adorable Emile survived being sacrificed. But Mammalians Nurturable had an entire room of those little guys, seemingly being bred for the purpose of accompanying Lumon-adjacent victims into the afterlife. What’s going to happen to them now—especially if their heroic keeper, played by Gwendoline Christie, decides she’s through being the team leader in the most slaughter-prone department on the severed floor?

Will innie Dylan quit or will he stay?

Dylan’s outie made a pretty flattering and compelling argument for his innie to stay at Lumon so we think he’ll stay. It’s his only job as far as we know. The problem is everything that happened with Mark, Helly, Mr. Milchick, and the rest. If Dylan’s innie does stay, it’ll likely be in a new role.

How will Irving return?

We really have no idea what story twist might bring back the fan-favorite character, sent into train-bound exile with Radar at his side. But John Turturro himself thinks there’s more of Irving’s story left to explore. We hope it might reveal who Irv, whose outie was clearly digging into Lumon’s secrets, was talking to on those clandestine pay-phone calls. We’d also like to know why Irv was having such vivid visions of the exports hall. A reunion with Burt would also be nice!

Is Mr. Milchick going to rebel?

io9 put this very question to Severance writer and showrunner Dan Erickson, and he agreed that Milchick’s big scene in “The After Party” standing up to Mr. Drummond signals there’s dissatisfaction brewing beneath that meticulous composure. But the day after “devour feculence,” Milchick put all that aside and was back to doing Lumon’s evil bidding. We’d love to see him really have a change of heart and realize he’s been fighting for the wrong side all this time… if he escapes that face-off with Dylan and the suddenly hostile marching band.

Will we see Miss Huang again?

Mr. Milchick let her graduate from the Wintertide Fellowship, but her next assignment took her to far-flung Svalbard, which is practically the North Pole. Will Eustace Huang turn into an angry adult with Lumon-focused revenge on her mind? It took decades for Harmony Cobel to get there, and she had much bigger reasons to be angry. At the very least, we can hope Miss Huang gets to play her theremin in peace now.

Will Harmony Cobel continue to fight Lumon and to get her credit for severance?

There was a reduced portion of Cobel throughout season two until “Sweet Vitriol” brought her back into the story in a big way, and revealed an important secret about her past that explains a lot about her peculiar relationship with Lumon. She described herself as an “ally” to Mark and Devon as they planned their Gemma jailbreak. Will that still be the case in light of everything that happened in “Cold Harbor,” or will she try to take control of her invention for less than benevolent purposes?

Why were Mark and Gemma chosen for Cold Harbor?

Think about it. Lumon kidnapped Gemma, faked her death, somehow ensured her grieving husband would be forced to take a job at their company—and not just any job, a severed job—so that he could work on macrodata refining her mind, all in service of this one purpose. Their link is the key to everything, so while there were some clues about their previous links with the creepy Dr. Bauer in the flashback episode, we imagine there is more to this story. And, when we asked Erickson about it, he refused to answer. Always a good sign.

What the hell is up with Jame Eagan?

Seriously. He’s a creepy old man from a line of creepy, creepy people, so some of it might just be Eagan genetics. But the breadcrumbs that were dropped about him this season were both shiver-inducing and nightmare-inspiring—including his implied use of the birthing cabins to hide the existence of his secret spawn, his musing that his daughter (who he doesn’t love) should eat her breakfast eggs raw (while he watches), and the fact that he’s only slightly more animated than the Kier Eagan wax dummy. His reaction to Cold Harbor’s spectacular implosion was a season-two comedic highlight, however.

What are other MDR departments doing?

The finale revealed specifically what Mark was doing with the MDR numbers. He was using emotions to explore the building blocks of Gemma’s mind, creating multiple different innie personalities for her. Great. But it’s not clear if that’s what everyone in MDR is doing. And we mean both in the room with Mark, as well as other rooms. This season revealed there are severed MDR employees all over and they weren’t all working on Gemma. Are there other Gemma-type captive test subjects not just in this building, but others? Is each refiner working on a specific person? Or are the other employees literally doing nothing just to trick one important one? It’s unclear but very interesting to think about. We asked Erickson about it and he didn’t want to say.

What were Lumon’s plans with Cold Harbor?

Here’s what we think we know about Cold Harbor. One, everyone at Lumon thought it was going to change the world. Two, it allowed a severed chip to render a human completely obedient. Putting those two things together, we can assume Lumon was going to—and may still—sell this to not just corporations but armies, countries, who knows? Who wouldn’t want the ability to, basically, control human beings to behave like lemmings? If you think about it, the very, very evil potential is endless, hence why it was such a big deal. That’s how we see it at least. The show could always flip things.

What the hell is up with Woe’s Hollow?

The fourth episode of season two has the severed employees take a trip to an outdoor park owned by Lumon where histories about Kier’s family are hidden in caves and doppelgangers of each of them appear out of nowhere to help on the journey. There were also marshmallows. It’s unclear whether any of this is at all important to the overall story of Severance, or if it’s just a way to show the broad scope of Lumon’s reach. Basically, we have no idea.

How does the department of Choreography and Merriment work?

So, Lumon hires people, puts them through intensive musical training, teaches them dance moves, outfits them in band uniforms, and just keeps them around for whenever a great big celebration is needed? Is this a full-time job? Do they hang out eight hours a day somewhere on the severed floor, maybe in a practice room we haven’t yet seen on the show?

Do all the Lumon buildings have their own departments of C&M, or is there some kind of severance-equipped motor coach that brings them from office to office as needed? Does Lumon also train non-severed marching bands to celebrate at public events? (This is another one of those questions that doesn’t really impact the plot of the show at all, but is still way too fun not to think about.)

What are the limits of severance?

We know about the overtime contingency. We’ve seen the Glasgow block. We’ve seen, thanks to Gemma, that a person’s severance chip can activate different and entirely separate innie personas. What else can this technology do—or rather, is there anything it can’t do?—and what are Lumon’s ultimate plans for deploying it?",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Creatine Might Not Be the Muscle Miracle We Thought It Was,https://gizmodo.com/creatine-might-not-be-the-muscle-miracle-we-thought-it-was-2000579803,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 20:10:10 GMT","A common workout supplement might be less useful than believed. In research out this month, scientists found that creatine failed to help people build significantly more muscle than normal while training.

Researchers at the University of New South Wales led the study, published last week in the journal Nutrients. The clinical trial compared people who underwent resistance training while taking or not taking a typical daily dose of creatine, finding no significant difference in added lean body mass by the end; everyone gained mass while training—the scientists just didn’t see more mass in the creatine group as they expected. The findings could mean that larger regular doses of the supplement are needed to see muscle-building benefits, the researchers say.

Creatine is naturally produced by the body and can be found in certain foods such as seafood and red meat. It helps supply energy to the muscles, particularly during intense bursts of activity like lifting weights. Some research has suggested that creatine supplementation can help improve people’s athletic performance and their ability to pack on muscle mass, including in placebo-controlled trials (a gold standard of research).

According to the UNSW researchers, however, these past trials may have had a critical flaw, since they often had people start taking creatine just as they began their new exercise routine. This design means it would be harder to tell apart the separate benefits of creatine from exercise.

To get around this possible limitation, the researchers had some of their volunteers take creatine a week before the exercise part of the trial—a 12 week course of resistance training—began, which is known as a “wash-in” period. The volunteers took 5 grams of creatine a day, a dose often used for maintenance once people start taking it regularly (the researchers note that a loading phase is not needed to reach the saturation level of creatine, or the maximum amount of stored creatine that our bodies respond to). People in both groups were relatively healthy, but weren’t big exercisers prior to the study; in total, 54 people completed the trial.

The creatine group did seem to experience a small boost in lean body mass on average during the first week (around 0.5 kilograms). But these gains ultimately didn’t give people a leg-up over the controls; by the study’s end, both groups gained roughly two kilograms in added lean body mass on average.

“The people taking the creatine supplement saw changes before they even started exercising, which leads us to believe that it wasn’t actual real muscle growth, but potentially fluid retention,” said study researcher Mandy Hagstrom, an exercise scientist at UNSW’s School of Health Sciences, in a statement from the university. “Then once they started exercising, they saw no additional benefit from creatine, which suggests that five grams per day is not enough if you’re taking it for the purposes of building muscle.”

The findings don’t necessarily sink creatine as a muscle-building aid, the researchers say. It’s possible that over the longer term, for instance, people taking creatine could still experience greater muscle mass. Or it might take a higher maintenance dose to see these effects (the researchers note that 10 grams a day can be safe to take). The researchers also avoided using a “loading phase,” which is when people will start by taking a much higher dose of creatine at first, up to 25 grams, for the first week, but they did expect to see some effect from the dose they used in their study.

Ultimately, the researchers say more studies will be needed to test different doses and treatment lengths—studies that will hopefully incorporate wash-in periods and other measures to ensure accurate results. But the current findings may already help people keep their expectations in check if they decide to start taking creatine for muscle mass, they add.

“For your average person taking creatine to boost their gains in the gym, this will hopefully change their perception about what it can help them achieve,” said lead author Imtiaz Desai, from UNSW’s School of Health Sciences and Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), in a statement. “For professional athletes, particularly those who must be at a particular weight for their sport, the findings may inform how and when they take the supplement.”",gizmodo

Kennedy Jr., ordered the nonprofit he once chaired to delete a webpage that mimicked the design of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention while wrongly linking vaccines to autism. The New York Times earlier reported on the development.

RFK Jr. has long been an outspoken skeptic of vaccines, despite scant evidence supporting cause for concern. The mock website featured evidence both supporting and debunking a connection to autism, but much of the research making a connection was reportedly not peer-reviewed.

That is a common strategy with conspiracy theorists—espouse some mainstream views that are undoubtedly true in order to create an aura of legitimacy for the more dubious statements that follow. Bryan Johnson, the longevity guru, offers fundamental advice that is reasonable—i.e. get a full night’s rest, eat unprocessed foods—then veers into more fringe ideas not necessarily supported by empirical evidence.

But Children’s Health Defense, the non-profit that RFK Jr. led for years before stepping aside in 2023, took an egregious step in creating a fake website intended to look like a real CDC fact sheet. From Your Local Epidemiologist, an independent Substack:

Apparently even RFK Jr. felt the webpage went too far. Or maybe it is simply that now, as the newly confirmed Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, he wants to use the institution and his newfound power to control the narrative. The CDC recently said it will re-investigate the link between vaccines and autism.

It is also possible that deadly measles outbreaks across the United States have something to do with RFK Jr.’s move. The outbreaks have been concentrated in communities with low vaccination rates. In January, an unvaccinated “school-aged” child in Texas died from measles—the first such U.S. death reported in a decade. Measles is highly contagious, and roughly 94% of a population needs to be vaccinated in order to prevent widespread transmission.

“Secretary Kennedy has instructed the Office of the General Counsel to send a formal demand to Children’s Health Defense requesting the removal of their website,” the Health and Human Services Department told the NYT in a statement. “At H.H.S. we are dedicated to restoring our agencies to their tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science.”

RFK Jr. during his Senate confirmation hearing said the CDC would return to “gold standard science,” and said he would support vaccines if shown data backing their safety. But when presented with such evidence during the hearing, RFK Jr. would say he had not seen the data or would cite reasons to doubt it.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,7 Details We Loved in Andor Season 2’s New Trailer,https://gizmodo.com/star-wars-andor-season-2-trailer-breakdown-ghorman-dedra-mon-mothma-2000579834,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 19:35:29 GMT","This morning Lucasfilm dropped our latest look at Andor‘s second and final season, with a tense examination of what price Rebels and Imperials alike are willing to play in the simmering Galactic Civil War. But while more broadly the trailer builds on a lot of what we’d already glimpsed in our first trailer for the season, it adds some interesting connective glue—while also raising some very interesting questions.

The Shadow of the Empire

A repeated image we see in this trailer is a glimpse of Imperial carriers and capital ships ominously hovering in the distance. It’s a great bit of imagery, and has a nice parallel to that moment we got in season one when Cinta saw the Star Destroyer come in over Aldhani after the heist, but it’s one that also really speaks to the added weight of the Imperial response to the growing resistance. Plus: in this shot in particular, it sure does look like Saw is entrenched on Jedha, watching a Star Destroyer loom over the city.

Cinta and Vel

Season one’s war-torn sapphics haven’t made many appearances in what we’ve seen of season two so far, so it’s nice to see them, and see them together. It’s hard to say where this is, given the lighting, but it’s going to be interesting to see how the couple navigate the growing split between Mon Mothma’s side of the broader rebellion, and Saw Gerrera’s partisans. One tiny glimpse we got of Vel in the recent season two “special look” video from a few weeks ago saw her seemingly training gathered insurgents how to aim a blaster, at what looked a lot like the Massassi base on Yavin IV… and she was alone. Does Cinta not make it through season two (she was busy being elsewhere in time and space, perhaps), or do we maybe see an ideological split that sees her join Saw instead?

A Different Kind of Mission

We get a little more of Luthen and Cassian’s tense conversation here—the “think like a leader!” one we’ve seen bits of already. But what they’re talking about seems very interesting. “If it goes up in flames?” Cassian asks, of a “different kind of mission” Luthen has offered him.

“It will burn. Very brightly,” is Luthen’s response, which makes it seem like we’re finally going to see all those “terrible things” Cassian tells Jyn he did on behalf of the Rebellion in Rogue One. So far, what little we’ve seen of the season so far, Cassian’s doing things that are a bit more typically heroic—direct action against the Empire, stealing TIE Fighters, and so on. What could be so dangerous that it’s worth doing even if it goes to hell? Well… there was one fascinating shot of that aforementioned season two behind-the-scenes tease, where Cassian prepares a blaster rifle in a room that certainly looked like it fit with the environment we now know is Ghorman, ready to depict the canonical interpretation of the massacre that takes place there in 2BBY. Could a different kind of mission for Luthen, in this case, be firing the first shot in a massacre that the Empire builds on?

Kleya and the Road to Rogue One

We get a much more significant part of Luthen’s assistant Kleya here (again, very noted: we do not see them together at all), as she tells Cassian about a weapon the Empire’s building—presumably what is going to be the first time he hears information about the Death Star, given the pointed cut to a shot of Krennic watching the battle station get built immediately after.

The Monster That Comes for Us All

We fill in another important detail about the aftermath of the aforementioned Ghorman Massacre here—a lot of the shots of Mon in this trailer are of her in the Senate, delivering a barnstorming speech with tears in her eyes. This, it seems is the speech she delivers decrying Palpatine for the Empire’s part in the slaughter on Ghorman, one that ultimately leads to her leaving the Senate… and, directly into the events of Star Wars Rebels‘ third season, where we see her flight from Coruscant take her to the orbit above Dantooine to deliver the formal declaration of a Rebel Alliance.

Choking on Your Aspirations

We’re not being given a lot of looks at Dedra this season so far, but this shot we get of her is setting off alarm bells in our heads. Of course Star Wars fans have been taught, more often than not, that an Imperial officer desperately clawing at their neck for seemingly no reason at all is to train us for a certain Dark Lord of the Sith to be somewhere near by, raising his hand in a choking motion. But does Andor seem like the kind of show that’s going to shoehorn in a Vader appearance to off Dedra? Probably not.

So why is Dedra having a panic attack and grabbing at her collar? Is it a lingering trauma from her experience on Ferrix? Has she, perhaps, witnessed something the Empire’s done that shakes even her resolve—and trying to literally physically tear away its grip around her neck?

Leida’s Wedding

We’ll take more insight into Chandrilan culture any way we can get it, but at least this is an explicit confirmation that a lot of the stuff we saw with Mon in the first trailer is all connected around Leida’s traditional marriage to Davo Sculdun’s son Stekan. Will all this be worth it for Mon to shuffle her money around and fund the Alliance?

Andor returns to Disney+ for one final season beginning April 22.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Acting Head of SEC Was Only Commissioner Who Didn’t Vote to Sue Elon Musk,https://gizmodo.com/acting-head-of-sec-was-only-commissioner-who-didnt-vote-to-sue-elon-musk-2000579825,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 18:56:27 GMT","Just before Donald Trump took office in January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly held a vote on whether the agency would sue Elon Musk for alleged violations of securities law related to his purchase of Twitter. According to Reuters, four commissioners—three Democrats and one Republican—voted to move forward with legal action against Musk. The lone “no” vote came from Mark Uyeda. He’s now the acting head of the agency.

At issue with the Musk case was his failure to share the fact that he had acquired more than 5% of shares in Twitter while it was still public, a threshold that requires public disclosure within 10 calendar days. Musk held onto the information for the full 10 days and then at least 10 more days, according to an SEC complaint, which allegedly allowed him to underpay for the shares by at least $150 million. Once Musk did finally make public that he owned more than 5% of the company, Twitter’s share price climbed 27%.

The SEC has been investigating that, along with other shady activity surrounding Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, since 2022. On January 14, 2025, the commissioners put it to a vote to determine if the agency would pursue legal action based on the findings of its investigation. Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce took issue with how much the SEC wanted to fine Musk, according to Reuters, but voted for the lawsuit anyway.

But Uyeda took a different route. According to a report from Bloomberg, he started lobbying SEC staffers to sign a pledge declaring that the case against Musk was not motivated by politics. Insisting that a case is not political is not a thing the SEC does (also declaring this case is not political implies other ones are, so it’d be weird to do) and staff refused to sign the pledge. With basically no one behind him, Uyeda voted no on the motion to sue Musk, and the motion passed, 4 to 1.

And now, a little over a month later, Uyeda has been tapped by Trump to be the acting head of the SEC. The agency is still moving forward with the lawsuit against Musk—in fact, he just got served a court summons related to the case last week that requires him or his lawyers to respond by April 4. But he can probably rest easy knowing the guy at the top of the agency is on his side. That, combined with Trump’s executive order declaring past Biden administration investigations to be politically motivated, the SEC adopting a new rule adding hurdles to conducting investigations, and the ongoing gutting of the agency by Musk himself and the Department of Government Efficiency, gives Musk quite a bit of sway in deciding the outcome of any action against him.",gizmodo

In the 1980 original film, the camp-counselor body count is all due to his mother, Pamela, seeking vengeance against those she blames for her son’s drowning death. We’ve long suspected she’ll be the central figure in Peacock and A24’s prequel series Crystal Lake, and now it’s confirmed who will play her: Linda Cardellini (Dead to Me, No Good Deed, Freaks and Geeks).

This news was widely confirmed in the trades today, though reporter Jeff Sneider said Cardellini was in talks for the role over a month ago. In Deadline‘s announcement it noted the premise of Crystal Lake is being “kept under wraps,” but that “Cardellini’s Pamela is believed to be a mother who had given up a singing career to raise a special needs child and takes a dark turn when she loses her son.”

The future of Crystal Lake was in turmoil after its original shepherd Bryan Fuller was fired last year—but the ship seemingly righted itself when Brad Caleb Kane (Black Sails, Tokyo Vice, the upcoming It: Welcome to Derry) came aboard as creator, writer, showrunner, and executive producer.

As a side note, Kane has his own background in music (he was the singing voice for Aladdin in the 1992 Disney film, among other credits), so while that “singing career” premise is only rumored, it seems like a thematic fit. Casting the versatile Cardellini, who seems more than capable of doing Betsy Palmer, the original Pamela Voorhees, proud feels like an energetic burst in the right direction for Crystal Lake.

What do you make of this casting, and does it make you even more excited to spend some time at a cursed summer camp?",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Webb Spots ‘Cosmic Tornado’ in Stunning Detail,https://gizmodo.com/webb-spots-cosmic-tornado-in-stunning-detail-2000579797,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 18:15:35 GMT","Webb has imaged phantasmal billows of bright orange space gas, captured in vibrant detail 630 light-years from Earth.

This is the dazzling power of the Webb Space Telescope on full display, revealing the protostellar outflow Herbig Haro 49/50 (or HH 49/50) from the telescope’s perch in space, about one million miles from Earth.

Herbig-Haro objects are outflows of material produced by a star’s jets. The large outflows move through material, creating shock waves in space that heat the material; as the material cools, it produces light—revealing objects like the glowing orange outflow above.

HH 49/50 was dubbed the Cosmic Tornado in 2006, when it was discovered by scientists using NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope. Webb has better resolution than Spitzer, giving scientists a more precise view of the outflow’s features. Furthermore, the object at the tip of the outflow—seen by Spitzer as a blue splotch—is now clearly visible, allowing scientists to identify it as a spiral galaxy.

Webb’s image of HH 49/50 made use of the telescope’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCAM) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to reveal the distribution of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and energized dust grains in the outflow. The data will eventually help scientists model the jet’s properties, as well as how it affects surrounding material.

Scientists believe that a protostar named Cederblad 110 IRS4, located about 1.5 light-years from HH 49/50, may drive the jets that are energizing the material in the object.

The galaxy seen at the tip of HH 49/50 is much more distant; eventually, HH 49/50 will appear to cover up the galaxy, though according to an ESA release that overlap will take thousands of years.

Other Herbig-Haro objects are worth noting. Consider HH 46/47, which looks just like a question mark floating in space. HH 49/50 isn’t even the Webb Space Telescope’s first foray into the objects; in 2023, the telescope captured the very elongated jets of HH 211, about 1,000 light-years from Earth.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,"Severance Season 3 Might Be Something Totally Different, but Probably Not",https://gizmodo.com/severance-season-3-plot-lumon-dan-erickson-2000579335,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:45:43 GMT","We’re talking a lot about Severance today and for good reason. The second season just wrapped up with a banger of a finale, an event that itself was almost three years in the making. Plus, a third season was officially announced and we got to chat with the show’s creator, Dan Erickson. It’s a lot of Lumon, to be sure, but best to get everything in before the long wait for the next season.

But what will that season even be? In an interview with Rolling Stone, Erickson discussed what season three could look like in a broader sense given what happens at the end of season two and it’s very, very interesting. So, it’s time to get into spoilers.

The first season of Severance ended with the four main characters rebelling against Lumon. Then, in the season two premiere, they’re back. It feels like a jump but the show takes a lot of time to explain how and why that happens, Basically though, it’s a reset.

Season two ends with the remaining innies—Mark, Helly, and Dylan—rebelling again, but this time on an even larger scale. They blow up one of Lumon’s biggest secrets, everything involving Cold Harbor including the kidnapping of Gemma Scout, and Mark even kills one of Lumon’s executives, Mr. Drummond. How could season three even begin to imagine people going back to work after all that and more?

Well, maybe it won’t. When asked directly about this pattern, Erickson had a very intriguing answer. “We like to blow up the formula at the end of each season and see if we could bring it back,” he said. “I don’t want to speak too much about what season three would look like. But I will say that we wanted to do something that blew up the world even more than in the first season. It’s a really valid question that people will be asking: ‘Can the show continue in the format that we’ve been seeing, or is it going to need to transform into something else?'”

That Erickson even acknowledges it could be “something else” suggests, well, that it could be “something else.” And maybe it will be. Or, maybe, it won’t. Maybe it’ll just ding back onto the severed floor of Lumon as the audience, and characters, anxiously await to learn how this evil corporation cleaned it all up.

We don’t know what season three will be but we have full trust in the team. And, thankfully, we now know it’s officially coming and hope it’ll come as soon as it can.

For more from Erickson read our interview, of course, but Rolling Stone’s is very good too. Both seasons of Severance are currently on Apple TV+ with season three on the way.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Careless People Made Me Like Sheryl Sandberg,https://gizmodo.com/careless-people-made-me-like-sheryl-sandberg-2000579178,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 13:05:30 GMT","Careless People is a very enjoyable book, and, depending on who you talk to (and presumably based on how much Meta stock they still own), people with knowledge of the events in the book either strongly agree with author Sarah Wynn-Williams or they say she’s full of shit. But in the course of her scathing assessment of building one of the most dangerous and powerful political tools in history, she also did something magical: She made me like Sheryl Sandberg.

As a woman, I know it is offensive to say I never much cared for Sheryl Sandberg, the former COO of Meta and the person everyone agrees made the company a monstrous success. I was there in the early 2010s when “I went to a live reading of Lean In” was a bragging right amongst professional women who were all eager to prove that they too had the stuff to build something ambitious while never fully joining the boy’s club. Like a vision out of 1980s Hollywood, Sandberg was a working woman, decked out in stylish power suits, with a platoon of assistants and a loving family, too, and she sold this promise to a lot of other women with much smaller paychecks and far fewer assistants.

I always thought Sandberg’s bit was too much. Her victory lap as a supreme Girl Boss felt baldly like a tool to market her book instead of a philosophy she lived by. She seemed to project an image where every flaw was carefully chosen to further the story of womanhood she was selling. It felt like just another iteration on the deeply annoying and offensive adage “a woman can have it all.”

And then I read about her desperate attempts to get clout online by claiming to have nearly been a passenger on a flight that crash landed, or using a work trip as an opportunity to promote her book and take the family on vacation, and she felt scandalously human. Through revealing anecdotes about her desperation and greed, she finally felt like one of us, instead of some sort of totem for working women.

Wynn-Williams’ Sandberg is a fragile creature who can be kind and sharp and capricious and cruel. Like this excerpt from the day she met then Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe:

I may have already been looking for evidence to confirm my sense of foreboding but when I arrive at Sheryl’s suite at the Ritz-Carlton the morning of the meeting, I see a stunningly beautiful Japanese woman, perfectly made up and stylishly dressed, quietly crying outside it.

“Are you okay?” I ask tentatively.

She nods. The tears streaming down her cheeks somehow make her even more impossibly lovely.

At that moment Debbie comes bundling out of Sheryl’s suite and pulls me close.

“I wouldn’t go in there.”

“Why?”

“You were going to go in there, weren’t you?”

“Um, yeah—what’s happening?”

“Major issue with the makeup and hair.”

“Is that who’s crying outside the door? The makeup artist?”

“Ah, yeah. The makeup was a disaster and let’s not mention the hair. I mean, I think it was basically fine, but Sheryl hated it and some of her instructions were lost in translation and it’s all come to a head.”

“Or on her head?” I try to pun. Debbie ignores it.

“Oh god. Is it a cultural thing?” I ask. “Like was the makeup artist doing what she thinks Western women want? Quite eighties? It’s still really early. Can you get someone else?”

“Ah, that was the someone else. She already fired the first makeup artist.”

“Ouch. She made her cry too? Okay, so I’m guessing a third makeup artist isn’t going to happen.”

“No, I think she’s going to do it herself, but this does not bode well for the day ahead.”

This is a side of Sheryl I have not seen before.

In this exchange, we don’t even see Sandberg, but we can already see she’s nervous—as anyone would be meeting a head of state. And when she’s nervous, she’s mean. The rest of the chapter retells the meeting, as well as Sandberg’s desperation to get a photo of the Prime Minister holding her book. It reads like a farce of powerful women in business, and I’ll admit to thinking Wynn-Williams was exaggerating.

But here’s that photo of Sandberg and Shinzo Abe. You can see her glee. You can see his amused confusion. You can see she posted this image after he was assassinated as proof that she once met him.

And all of that, while not the image Sandberg seeks to convey, makes her so much more likable. The book gets darker and darker as it goes on and Wynn-Williams realizes just how awful the ramifications of Facebook’s growth-at-all-costs mentality are. But having lived through it all and watching just how terrible Meta’s impact would be on democracy, I found something charming in Sandberg’s humanity.

Sure, she might have helped set up the fall of more than one nation, but she really was just a woman trying to do her best.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Will Bring Its Nazi-Punching to PS5 Very Soon,https://gizmodo.com/indiana-jones-game-ps5-release-date-great-circle-2000579827,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:00:36 GMT","I’ve been waiting to punch Nazis for what feels like forever and today, I found out I’ll get to do it very, very soon. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was released exclusively for PC and Xbox late last year but, as a PlayStation and Apple owner, I was left hanging from a rope bridge. I wanted to solve puzzles. I wanted to travel the world. I wanted to punch Nazis. But I couldn’t do any of that just yet.

My day is coming though. Bethesda just announced Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is coming to PlayStation 5 on April 17, which is way, way sooner than I expected. That means in just a few short weeks, I’m going to jump under the fedora of Indiana Jones and go on a brand new adventure. There are three different versions, each with different goodies, and you can get all the specifics here.

This news is extra special to me though because, of course, I’m a huge Indiana Jones fan and I’d been excited about this game for years. Bethesda first announced it was doing an Indy game way back in 2021 so by the time 2024 came around, I was ready. I was even considering buying an Xbox because I wanted to play it so badly. But then, the io9 review came out and James was incredibly disappointed by it. He basically said he liked the story but the game itself made him “miserable.” “Miserable” is not the word you want to hear about a game you’ve been waiting years for. Plus, he and I had a similar reaction to Star Wars Outlaws, which came out a few months prior. I just didn’t love how it played.

However, I was encouraged that his was one of few negative reviews. Lots of people disagreed. So, I had two reactions. One, I’m not buying an Xbox to play this game. Two, I still want to play but I’ll wait for the PS5 release.

And now, that PS5 release is here. I’ll be at Star Wars Celebration Japan when the game is released—but soon after, I will certainly have my own take. I hope I like it more than James did. And if I don’t, at least it only cost me $70, not $700. And in the absolute worst-case scenario, at least I get to punch some Nazis.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,23andMe’s Former CEO Is Posting Through Its Bankruptcy Filing,https://gizmodo.com/23andmes-former-ceo-is-posting-through-its-bankruptcy-filing-2000579738,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 15:27:55 GMT","Genetic testing company 23andMe has filed for bankruptcy after its board rejected a bid from its CEO to take it private. Four years ago the genetic testing company was valued at $3.5 billion. Now it’ll be lucky if someone pays $50 million for it. If you haven’t done it yet, there’s never been a better time to delete your 23andMe data.

The company filed for bankruptcy on Sunday after weeks of a collapsing stock price and multiple unsuccessful bids to buy the company and take it private from co-founder and former CEO Anne Wojcicki. Its board did not want Wojcick and found her bids wanting. Reuters said her last pitch was 41 cents a share to take the company private, which would have valued the company at just $11 million. She resigned as CEO after this bid failed.

In 2021, Forbes declared Wojcicki America’s newest “self made billionaire” after she cut a deal with Richard Branson to launch the 23andMe IPO. Now she’s posting through the collapse of her company on X.com and trying to find a way back into the business she started. “I have resigned as CEO of the company so I can be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder,” she said in a long post on X.

“What made so many of our innovations possible were the 85% of our customers who opted in to research. Thanks to them they have empowered an incredible platform for discovery,” Wojcicki said. “23andMe was not a good steward of that data,” Wojcicki said in her post.

Which is true. Under Wojcicki’s tenure, 23andMe were bad stewards of people’s data. The company launched in 2006 and became a sensation after Oprah added one of its genetic testing kits to her list of “favorite things.” The pitch was simple: 23andMe would take a swab of your data and tell you about your genetics, including your propensity towards certain diseases and possible ancestors. 23andMe’s fortunes soured in 2023 after a hacker breached its servers and exposed the genetic data of 6.9 million customers.

The company didn’t handle it well. First it said that only 14,000 people had been exposed before it copped to the much larger number. Then it changed its terms of service on the sly in an attempt to dump angry customers into a mass arbitration process. In the end it agreed to pay a $30 million settlement and foot the bill for credit monitoring of the millions of people it exposed.

“Our foundation was the trust and respect of our customers, and they were always the guiding light on how we made decisions,” Wojcicki said in her post on X Monday morning. The data breach eroded that trust. The foundation was ruined. Throughout 2023 and 2024, 23andMe’s stock price tumbled and at the end of 2024 it laid off 200 employees. The layoffs deepened concerns that it could keep people’s genetic information safe and that it had a path of making money at all.

One of Wojcicki’s proposed solutions to turning the company around was bullying users into allowing their genetic data to be used for scientific research. “We now have the ability to mine the dataset for ourselves, as well as to partner with other groups,” the former CEO told Wired in 2024. It was a profound misreading of the moment.

“We have had many successes but I equally take accountability for the challenges we have today,” Wojcicki said on X after she resigned. “There is no doubt that the challenges faced by 23andMe through an evolving business model have been real, but my belief in the company and its future is unwavering. Consumers are rising up and asking for more control over their health and want greater knowledge about how to be healthy and why they may have health issues.”

She’s right, consumers are rising up and taking control over their health. One of the ways they’re doing it is by kicking gimmick genetic testing services like 23andMe out of their life. The truth is there’s not much the service can tell you. A complete genetic panel requires an in-depth screening of your entire family. Thanksgiving is hard enough without trying to get your uncle to spit into a tube.

After 23andMe and similar services hit the market, a lot of people got the tests done so they could learn more about their ethnic backgrounds. Americans wanted to know if the stories about being one-sixth Cherokee were true and they had found a test that could tell them. But once the test had been paid for, what else did 23andMe have?

It attempted to sell a subscription service that cost $1,188 a year. A cheaper version of the plan cost $298 up front and just $69 a year. But consumers weren’t buying and the data breach moved some of them to delete their account and reconsider what personal data they gave to the company.

With Wojcicki out, CFO Joe Selsavage is taking over to see the company through its bankruptcy. It got $35 million in financing to help it through the process and listed its assets and liabilities between $100 million and $500 million. It’s impossible to know what will happen to the data of the millions of people who swabbed a cheek and sent in a sample. So, again, it’s time to delete your data.

“If I am fortunate enough to secure the company’s assets through the restructuring process, I remain committed to our long-term vision of being a global leader in genetics and establishing genetics as a fundamental part of healthcare ecosystems worldwide,” Wojcicki said on X, perhaps misreading the moment once again.",gizmodo

If the first trailer for the season struck a more rock n’ roll tone for its feelings of revolution, this second trailer is much more in line with the vibes people expect from Andor. Punctuated by the dramatic, blaring tone of Star Wars‘ iconic Imperial klaxon, there’s high drama, high stakes, and a lot of questioning of just what Imperial and Rebel alike are willing to sacrifice in the name of the brewing war to come.

The trailer largely expounds on things we saw and spotted in the first—more Rogue One action as Saw’s partisans begin to flourish and Krennic’s plans for the Death Star become clearer and clearer, the show’s depiction of the fundamental turning point in the Rebellion’s formation, the Ghorman Massacre, and even a bit more of Mon Mothma’s return to Chandrila for Leida’s wedding.

But a much stronger theme this time is the Imperial’s own fight back against the growing insurgency—the pressure that places on both sides as tensions get higher and higher. We get haunting shots of Imperial carriers and capital ships in the skies, Stormtroopers running around, and a snifter more of what Dedra and Syril alike are going to be up to this season. It’s all good stuff, and even if we know where it’s all going, seeing how Tony Gilroy and his team fit the pieces together is shaping up to look like something rather special.

But before she gets back home, it looks like she’s going to be whisked on some weird and wonderful adventures across, time, space, and yes, even some relative dimensions too.

The BBC and Disney have dropped a new trailer for Doctor Who‘s return next month, give us our best look yet at what to expect from the latest season of the show. We get to see what looks like a good chunk of the first episode that sees Sethu’s new companion, a nurse named Belinda Chandra, whisked into the Doctor’s orbit–but we also do get to see a few intriguing teases of adventures to come.

One big thing that seems to tie this all together? Something has happened to the Earth. As much as Belinda wants to get home, it seems like through a mix of issues with the TARDIS–even moreso than usual–and something far sinister, since it seems like other humans across the future have no idea that the planet exists, the Doctor and Belinda are going to have to take the long way round to get back. The very long way round.

At least so far that extended trip back looks pretty fun! There’s some killer teases here: new monsters, new dangers, endless new looks for Gatwa to save the day in. We even get another fleeting glimpse at Alan Cumming’s animated new villain Mr Ring-a-Ding, who seems to get the Doctor and Belinda themselves in on the 2D action too.

NASA’s websites no longer include references to landing a crew that includes the first woman and first person of color on the Moon as part of the upcoming Artemis 3 mission, which is slated for sometime in 2027. On its websites, the agency had previously stated its intent to “land the first woman, first person of color, and first international partner astronaut on the Moon using innovative technologies to explore more of the lunar surface than ever before.” That phrase, however, has been removed from NASA’s website as of Friday, the Orlando Sentinel first reported.

This is the latest in a series of steps the space agency has taken to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order targeting diversity and inclusion at federal agencies. Shortly after Trump assumed office, NASA shut down offices related to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA), and canceled any related contracts. Shortly afterwards, NASA employees were ordered to remove mentions of DEIA programs, underrepresented groups/people, environmental justice, and “anything specifically targeting women (women in leadership, etc.),” from the agency’s websites. NASA employees are also no longer allowed to display their pronouns in email signatures or on Microsoft Teams.

NASA’s efforts to comply with the administration’s war on diversity and inclusion goes against its earlier promise to diversify its astronaut crews. In 2023, NASA revealed the four-person crew set to fly to the Moon and back as part of the Artemis 2 mission. The crew included NASA astronauts Victor Glover, who became the first Black crew member to live on board the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the SpaceX Crew-1 mission in November 2021, in which he served as the pilot. NASA astronaut Christina Koch was also selected for the Artemis 2 mission. Koch set the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman after spending a total of 328 days on board the International Space Station (ISS) for Expeditions 59, 60, and 61. The NASA astronaut also participated in the first all-female spacewalk, alongside astronaut Jessica Meir, in October 2019.

Unlike the days of Apollo, NASA was aiming to land a more inclusive crew on the lunar surface as part of its return to the Moon more than 50 years later. It’s not clear, however, whether NASA will stick to the plan after removing mention of its commitment to a diverse crew for Artemis 3.",gizmodo
https://wired.com,The Quantum Apocalypse Is Coming. Be Very Afraid,https://wired.com/story/q-day-apocalypse-quantum-computers-encryption,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT","One day soon, at a research lab near Santa Barbara or Seattle or a secret facility in the Chinese mountains, it will begin: the sudden unlocking of the world’s secrets. Your secrets.

Cybersecurity analysts call this Q-Day—the day someone builds a quantum computer that can crack the most widely used forms of encryption. These math problems have kept humanity’s intimate data safe for decades, but on Q-Day, everything could become vulnerable, for everyone: emails, text messages, anonymous posts, location histories, bitcoin wallets, police reports, hospital records, power stations, the entire global financial system.

“We’re kind of playing Russian roulette,” says Michele Mosca, who coauthored the most recent “Quantum Threat Timeline” report from the Global Risk Institute, which estimates how long we have left. “You’ll probably win if you only play once, but it’s not a good game to play.” When Mosca and his colleagues surveyed cybersecurity experts last year, the forecast was sobering: a one-in-three chance that Q-Day happens before 2035. And the chances it has already happened in secret? Some people I spoke to estimated 15 percent—about the same as you’d get from one spin of the revolver cylinder.

The corporate AI wars may have stolen headlines in recent years, but the quantum arms race has been heating up too. Where today’s AI pushes the limits of classical computing—the kind that runs on 0s and 1s—quantum technology represents an altogether different form of computing. By harnessing the spooky mechanics of the subatomic world, it can run on 0s, 1s, or anything in between. This makes quantum computers pretty terrible at, say, storing data but potentially very good at, say, finding the recipe for a futuristic new material (or your email password). The classical machine is doomed to a life of stepwise calculation: Try one set of ingredients, fail, scrap everything, try again. But quantum computers can explore many potential recipes simultaneously.

So, naturally, tech giants such as Google, Huawei, IBM, and Microsoft have been chasing quantum’s myriad positive applications—not only for materials science but also communications, drug development, and market analysis. China is plowing vast resources into state-backed efforts, and both the US and the European Union have pledged millions in funding to support homegrown quantum industries. Of course, whoever wins the race won’t just have the next great engine of world-saving innovation. They’ll also have the greatest code-breaking machine in history. So it’s normal to wonder: What kind of Q-Day will humanity get—and is there anything we can do to prepare?

If you had a universal picklock, you might tell everyone—or you might keep it hidden in your pocket for as long as you possibly could. From a typical person’s vantage point, maybe Q-Day wouldn’t be recognizable as Q-Day at all. Maybe it would look like a series of strange and apparently unconnected news stories spread out over months or years. London’s energy grid goes down on election day, plunging the city into darkness. A US submarine on a covert mission surfaces to find itself surrounded by enemy ships. Embarrassing material starts to show up online in greater and greater quantities: classified intelligence cables, presidential cover-ups, billionaires’ dick pics. In this scenario, it might be decades before we’re able to pin down exactly when Q-Day actually happened.

Then again, maybe the holder of the universal picklock prefers the disaster-movie outcome: everything, everywhere, all at once. Destroy the grid. Disable the missile silos. Take down the banking system. Open all the doors and let the secrets out.",wired
https://wired.com,Hot New Thermodynamic Chips Could Trump Classical Computers,https://wired.com/story/thermodynamic-computing-ai-guillaume-verdon-based-beff-jezos,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT","Guillaume Verdon stands before me with a new kind of computer chip in his hand—a piece of hardware he believes is so important to the future of humanity that he’s asked me not to reveal our exact location, for fear that his headquarters could become the target of industrial espionage.

This much I can tell you: We’re in an office a short drive from Boston, and the chip arrived from the foundry just a few days ago. It sits on a circuit board about the width of a Big Mac. The pinky-nail-sized piece of silicon itself is dotted with an exotic set of components: not the transistors of an ordinary semiconductor, nor the superconducting elements of a quantum chip, but the guts of a radically new paradigm called thermodynamic computing.

Not unlike its quantum cousin, thermodynamic computing promises to move beyond the binary constraints of 1s and 0s. But while quantum computing sets out—through extreme cryogenic cooling—to minimize the random thermodynamic fluctuations that occur in electronic components, this new paradigm aims to harness those very fluctuations.

Engineers are chasing both paradigms in a race to accelerate past ordinary silicon chips and satisfy the ravenous demand for processing power in the age of AI. But Verdon—with his startup, Extropic—isn’t just a contestant in that race. He’s also one of the AI era’s most shameless hype men. He is far better known as his online alter ego, Based Beff Jezos, the founding prophet of an ideology called effective accelerationism.

Known as “e/acc” for short, effective accelerationism is an irreverent rejection of effective altruism, a movement that has persuaded many technically minded people that the rise of artificial general intelligence—unless it is corralled and made safe—poses an almost certain existential risk to humanity. “EA’s be like: ‘I believe in Leprechauns and the burden of proof is on you to disprove me,’” went one fairly typical Based Beff post from 2022.

The AI existential risk movement, he wrote in another post that year, “is an infohazard that causes depression in our most talented and intelligent folks, killing our productive gains towards a greater more prosperous future.” Another frequent target of his mockery is the AI ethics movement, which critiques large language models as riddled with the biases and blind spots of their architects. As Based Beff continued to spread e/acc’s gospel online, it quickly became a rallying cry among some members of the tech elite, with prominent figures like Marc Andreessen and Garry Tan temporarily adding “e/acc” to their X usernames.

Effective accelerationism is perhaps best seen as the most technical fringe of a broader zeitgeist: a belief that American politics is broken and that caution, overregulation, and woke ideology are holding the country back. That ethos helped propel Donald Trump back to the White House, with Elon Musk, a hero of the e/acc movement, by his side. Like Trump 2.0, effective accelerationism promises an unstoppable American renaissance and an untroubled view of the work needed to get there. In both cases, the details are fuzzy.

But under the sharp resolution of a laboratory microscope, the specifics of Verdon’s new chip are, if nothing else, plain to see: an array of square features each a few dozen microns wide. These components, Verdon promises, will be used to generate “programmable randomness”—a chip in which probabilities can be controlled to produce useful computations. When combined with a classical computer, he says, they will provide a highly efficient way to model uncertainty, a key task in all sorts of advanced computing, from modeling the weather and financial markets to artificial intelligence. (Some academic labs have already built prototype thermodynamic hardware, including a simple neural network—the technology at the heart of modern machine learning.)",wired

Almost every coder we surveyed had strong opinions on the matter. Here’s ChatGPT’s summary of the responses (with its boldface emphasis preserved):

“The coders have spoken—and they’re not packing up their keyboards just yet. While a small but vocal group insists AI will devour programming jobs in time, most dismiss full automation as a pipe dream. The doom prophets warn that corporate bosses will slash payrolls the moment AI looks capable, leaving human engineers debugging their own obsolescence. The skeptics scoff, arguing AI is more like a hyperefficient intern—useful, but clueless—that can’t handle context, edge cases, or real problem-solving. The realists see AI as a force multiplier, not a job killer—automating repetitive coding but leaving the creativity, architecture, and debugging to humans. “If AI does eat programming,” one put it, “I’ll just switch to debugging AI.”* The real verdict? AI isn’t coming for your job—but it is changing it. Adapt or get left behind.🚀”

*Nobody actually said this! ChatGPT—bless it—made several mistakes throughout this process. Not only did it fabricate quotes, it also misread results, generated incomprehensible graphs, and, at multiple points, stopped counting “freelancers” as a category entirely. Rude.**

https://wired.com,The Weight of the Internet Will Shock You,https://wired.com/story/weight-of-the-internet,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT","The internet is massive. But does it have … actual mass? Big server farms and miles of fiber-optic cables do, of course, but we don’t mean the infrastructure of the internet. We mean the internet itself. The information. The data. The cybernetics. And because storing and moving stuff through cyberspace requires energy—which, per Einstein, has mass—it should, in theory, be possible to calculate the internet’s weight.

Way back in the adolescent days of the web, in 2006, a Harvard physicist named Russell Seitz made an attempt. His conclusion? If you consider the mass of the energy powering the servers, the internet comes out to roughly 50 grams—or about the weight of a couple strawberries. People still use Seitz’s comparison to this day. We’re all wasting our lives on something we could swallow in one bite!

Current estimates say that 1 gram of DNA can encode 215 petabytes—or 215 x 1015 bytes—of information. If the internet is 175 x 10247 bytes, that’s 960,947 grams’ worth of DNA. That’s the same as 64,000 strawberries.

But a lot has happened since 2006—Instagram, iPhones, and the AI boom, to name a few. (By Seitz’s logic, the internet would now weigh as much as a potato.) There’s also the fact that, around the time of Seitz’s calculation, Discover magazine proposed a different method. Information on the internet is written in bits, so what if you looked at the weight of the electrons needed to encode those bits? Using all internet traffic—then estimated to be 40 petabytes—Discover put the internet’s weight at a tiny fraction (5 millionths) of a gram. So, more like a squeeze of strawberry juice. WIRED thought it was time to investigate for ourselves.

If the internet is the equivalent of 960,947 grams’ worth of DNA, that’s the same as one-third of a Cybertruck.

First up: the server-energy method. “Fifty grams is just wrong,” says Christopher White, president of NEC Laboratories America and a veteran of storied research powerhouse Bell Labs. Other scientists we spoke to agreed. Daniel Whiteson, a particle physicist at UC Irvine and cohost of the podcast Daniel and Kelly’s Extraordinary Universe, said it’s an overly convenient way to get “the units you want”—like assuming the price of a doughnut could be calculated by dividing the total number of doughnuts in the world by the world GDP. Preposterous! That would give us a doughnut-per-dollar figure, sure, “but it wouldn’t be correct, or even close,” Whiteson says.

Discover magazine’s calculation also seemed a little off to us. It has more to do with the transmission of the internet, as opposed to the internet itself. It also assumes a set number of electrons needed to encode information. In reality, the number is incredibly varied and depends on the specific chips and circuits being used.

White suggested a third method. What if we pretend to put all the data stored on the internet, across all the hundreds of millions of servers around the world, in just one place? How much energy would we need to encode that data, and how much would that energy weigh? In 2018, the International Data Corporation estimated that by 2025, the internet’s datasphere would reach 175 zettabytes, or 1.65 x 1024 bits. (1 zettabyte = 10247 bytes and 1 byte = 8 bits.) White suggested multiplying those bits by a mathematical term—k B T ln2, if you’re curious—that captures the minimum energy needed to reset a bit. (Temperature is a factor, because storing data is easier in colder conditions. Meaning: The internet is lighter in space than it is in Tucson, Arizona.) We can then take that number, which will represent energy, and call on E = mc2 to reach the total mass. At room temperature, the entirety of the internet would weigh (1.65 x 1024) x (2.9×10–21)/c2, or 5.32 x 10–14 grams. That’s 53 quadrillionths of a gram.

If the internet is 175 x 10247 bytes, that’s 960,947 grams’ worth of DNA. That’s the same as 10.6 American males.

Which … is no fun. Even if it has almost no physical mass, the internet still feels weighty, to those billions of us weighed down by it every day. White, who has previously attempted similar philosophical estimates, clarified that in reality, the web is so intricate that it is “essentially unknowable,” but why not try? In recent years, scientists have floated the idea of storing data within the building blocks of nature: DNA. So what if we were to weigh the internet in those terms? Current estimates say that 1 gram of DNA can encode 215 petabytes—or 215 x 1015 bytes—of information. If the internet is 175 x 10247 bytes, that’s 960,947 grams’ worth of DNA. That’s the same as 10.6 American males. Or one third of a Cybertruck. Or 64,000 strawberries.

https://wired.com,Using Starlink Wi-Fi in the White House Is a Slippery Slope for US Federal IT,https://wired.com/story/white-house-starlink-wifi/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:24:31 GMT","As the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues to rampage through the United States federal government, essentially guided by Elon Musk, the group has also been upending traditional IT boundaries—evaluating digital systems and allegedly accessing personally identifiable information as well as data that has typically been off-limits to those without specific training. Last week, The New York Times reported that the White House is adding Musk-owned SpaceX’s Starlink Wi-Fi “to improve Wi-Fi connectivity on the complex,” according to a statement from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. The White House's Starlink internet service is reportedly being donated by the company.

Spotty internet is an annoying but highly solvable problem that WIRED has reported on extensively. Of course, the White House is a highly complex organization operating out of a historic building, but network security researchers, government contractors, and former intelligence analysts with years of experience in US federal government security all tell WIRED that adding Starlink Wi-Fi in a seemingly rushed and haphazard way is an inefficient and counterproductive approach to solving connectivity issues. And they emphasized that it could set problematic precedents across the US government: that new pieces of technology can simply be layered into an environment at will without adequate oversight and monitoring.

“This is shadow IT, creating a network to bypass existing controls,” alleges Nicholas Weaver, a member of the nonprofit International Computer Science Institute's network security team and a computer science lecturer at UC Davis. He adds that while secret and top secret information is typically (but not always) processed only on special, separate federal networks that have no wireless access, the security and uniformity of White House Wi-Fi is still extremely important to national security. “A network like the White House unclassified side is still going to be very sensitive,” he says.

“Just like the Biden Administration did on numerous occasions, the White House is working to improve WiFi connectivity on the complex,” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt tells WIRED in a statement.

A White House source who asked not to be named supported the switch, arguing that in some areas of the campus, “the old Wi-Fi was trash.”

Researchers point out that while Starlink is a robust commercial ISP like any other, it is not clear that it is being implemented in compliance with White House Communication Agency requirements. If the controls on the White House Starlink Wi-Fi are more lax than on other White House Wi-Fi, it could introduce security exposures and blind spots in network monitoring for anomalous activity.

“The only reason they'd need Starlink would be to bypass existing security controls that are in place from WHCA,” claims former NSA hacker Jake Williams. “The biggest issues would be: First, if they don't have full monitoring of the Starlink connection. And second, if it allows remote management tools, so they could get remote access back into the White House networks. Obviously anyone could abuse that access.”

One baffling aspect of the arrangement is that Starlink and other satellite internet is designed to be used in places that have little or no access to terrestrial internet service—in other words, places where there are no reliable fiber lines or no wired infrastructure at all. Instead of a traditional ISP modem, Starlink customers get special panels that they install on a roof or other outdoor place to receive connectivity from orbiting satellites. The New York Times reported, though, that the White House Starlink panels are actually installed miles away at a White House data center that is routing the connectivity over existing fiber lines. Multiple sources emphasized to WIRED that this setup is bizarre.",wired
https://wired.com,Trump’s Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants,https://wired.com/story/trump-us-cloud-services-europe/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 06:00:00 GMT","The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.

There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.

“There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.

The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.”

Two European-based cloud service companies, Exoscale and Elastx, tell WIRED they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon US cloud providers over the last two weeks—with some already starting to make the jump. Multiple technology advisers say they are having widespread discussions about what it would take to uproot services, data, and systems.

“We have more demand from across Europe,” says Mathias Nöbauer, the CEO of Swiss-based hosting provider Exoscale, adding there has been an increase in new customers seeking to move away from cloud giants. “Some customers were very explicit,” Nöbauer says. “Especially customers from Denmark being very explicit that they want to move away from US hyperscalers because of the US administration and what they said about Greenland.”

“It's a big worry about the uncertainty around everything. And from the Europeans’ perspective—that the US is maybe not on the same team as us any longer,” says Joakim Öhman, the CEO of Swedish cloud provider Elastx. “Those are the drivers that bring people or organizations to look at alternatives.”

Concerns have been raised about the current data-sharing agreement between the EU and US, which is designed to allow information to move between the two continents while protecting people’s rights. Multiple previous versions of the agreement have been struck down by European courts. At the end of January, Trump fired three Democrats from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), which helps manage the current agreement. The move could undermine or increase uncertainty around the agreement. In addition, Öhman says, he has heard concerns from firms about the CLOUD Act, which can allow US law enforcement to subpoena user data from tech companies, potentially including data that is stored in systems outside of the US.",wired
https://wired.com,The Chaos of NIH Cuts Has Left Early-Career Scientists Scrambling,https://wired.com/story/the-chaos-of-nih-cuts-has-left-early-career-scientists-scrambling/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 10:44:26 GMT","Nada Fadul’s love for science and medicine began early. As a child, the aspiring physician-scientist had observed her father, a doctor, treat patients at his primary care office. Later, as an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, Fadul had the opportunity to work in a lab developing nanotherapies for ovarian cancer. Through these experiences and a strong cadre of mentors, she “felt really inspired to pursue both research and medicine,” she says.

To gain more lab experience before applying to joint MD-PhD programs, Fadul had decided to apply to the National Institutes of Health’s postbaccalaureate program, which offers full-time research positions to recent college graduates considering careers in medicine or STEM. But in early February, she received an email stating that the program had been completely paused. “There’s always some changes when the administration changes, but I didn’t expect the changes to hit so close to home and to affect my hopes and plans for the upcoming year,” Fadul says.

Changed plans, lost opportunities, worries for the future—these are all things that current and prospective scientists across the country now face on a day-to-day basis. Since January, a rapid-fire slurry of executive orders have driven huge cuts to federal funding, hiring freezes, and thousands of layoffs across the research sector, with thousands more job losses expected. For students and graduates, the knock-on effect is a big reduction in opportunities to gain the experience and placements needed to enter and progress in the field.

During the lifespan of a scientist, there are several critical steps. For many, the first is to gain research experience during college—whether through working in a university laboratory or through summer research programs. From there, some take gap years (with the NIH postbaccalaureate program previously a popular option) to pursue even more research. Then comes an application to graduate school, completing graduate school, and possibly doing a postdoctoral fellowship. After all of that, only some end up as research faculty at institutions—where they embark on a decades-long saga of grant applications, many of which are for federal funding from the NIH or National Science Foundation (NSF).

It’s a process that already forces young scientists to compete for a limited number of spots at each stage of training. Many, like Fadul, seek out extra research opportunities to ready their applications. The process of simply applying to graduate school is “five to ten years in the making,” says a current post-baccalaureate scholar at the NIH, who requested anonymity due to fear of retribution. “I think that for almost all of the applicants, this is their dream, and this feels like their livelihood.” In the space of two months, it is a career pathway that has rapidly narrowed.

After the administration’s initial memos indicating that a federal funding freeze was imminent in late January, graduate programs across the US began reducing the number of admitted students. To track what exactly was happening, faculty and students began compiling a comprehensive list of universities and their associated program reductions—based on word of mouth and reported evidence. Among many others, this included a 20 percent reduction at MIT’s biology graduate program, an estimated 20 percent reduction at Duke’s biomedical graduate programs, and a 30 percent reduction at UC San Diego’s biological sciences program—from 25 places down to 17.",wired

Short shorts: 3-inch and 5-inch shorts are cut high on the thigh from lightweight fabrics, designed for total freedom and a barely-there feel. Storage, where there is any, tends to be limited. These are most at home on the track or a marathon start line.

2-in-1 shorts: These pair a tighter—and sometimes longer leg—liner short that acts as built-in underwear, with a lighter, baggier outer short. Good for colder climates and arguably more appropriate for your post-run coffee stop.

Half-tights: Dropping just above the knee they offer a tight, second-skin fit, excellent support and are made to maximize mobility. Mainly found on the track or road, this aesthetic leaves little to the imagination.

Max-storage shorts: Designed for longer runs, ultras, and adventures where you need to carry more kit with easy access, these shorts tend to also be the hybrid 2-in-1 with built-in liners, but the main aim is to beef up storage with built-in mesh belts, thigh pockets, and zippered back pockets.",wired
https://wired.com,How to Buy the Best Keycaps for Your Mechanical Keyboard,https://wired.com/story/how-to-buy-keycaps-for-your-mechanical-keyboard/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT","Whether you’re buying your first mechanical keyboard or doing research for your endgame build, keycaps are a huge part of not only your keyboard’s appearance but also its all-around typing experience. The keycaps you choose can have a massive impact on how you type, what it feels like, and what your keyboard sounds like. That's why it’s important to find the right set for your personal needs.

However, there are a lot of different details to consider when looking at keycaps, and it can be overwhelming if you’re new to the hobby or out of the loop on certain developments. I’ve put together this guide to serve as a jumping-off point into the world of keycaps. Here's everything you need to know.

Make Sure the Keycaps Will Fit

The most important part of any keycap set is to make sure the keycaps will fit your keyboard. If not, you’ll either be stuck not using the set at all, or mixing your brand-new keycaps with old ones for full coverage. To start, here’s what you’ll want to look for.

Make sure your keycaps fit your switches! Most modern keyboards use standard MX-style switches with a plus-shaped stem. These have become ubiquitous, and as a result, almost every keycap set offered today will be compatible with them. However, if you want to use keycaps from an older keyboard, there’s a good chance they won’t fit a newer one.

The three most common “alternative” switches are Alps switches, which have a small minus-shaped stem, Topre (also referred to as EC) switches, which have a circular stem, and Kailh Choc low-profile switches, which have two prongs on the stem. These keycaps cannot be used on an MX-style keyboard, but any keycap listings will clearly label them.

Next, you'll want to check layouts. While most keyboards have adopted fairly standardized layouts today, a few stand out. The best modern example is the HHKB Studio, which has unique G, H, and B keys, plus a shorter-than-average spacebar, none of which are included in the “standard” keycap set. Some keycap sets will have specific kits to cover more unusual layouts though.

Make sure your keycap set has full coverage. While most sets today include everything needed for a full-size keyboard, I have seen an influx of keycap sets that sell the number pad separately in exchange for a lower base price, and the same has even been the case for arrows and function row keys, particularly on budget-oriented (or customizable) keycap sets.

Keycap Profiles and Sculpts

After you’ve figured out what kind of keycaps you need for your keyboard, you should start thinking about what shape you want these keycaps to be. The shape of your keycaps will have the largest impact on how typing feels, and on how comfortable typing is. The most basic aspects of this are the height of the keycap, the shape it is sculpted in, and the presence of different sculpted rows.

But first, it’s worth noting that there is no standardized naming convention for keycap profiles—the names themselves are arbitrary and are determined entirely by the keycap manufacturer. Some have logical names (like how OSA keycaps are a fusion of OEM—original equipment manufacturer—and SA—spherical all—sculpts), while others are a bit silly (PBS stands for Penguin Belly Slide).",wired

https://wired.com,Space Heater Safety Tips: How Not to Set a Fire,https://wired.com/story/space-heater-safety-tips/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 11:36:00 GMT","Space heater safety is a lot better than it used to be. Modern space heaters are heavily regulated, especially regarding exposed heating elements and automatic shut-off switches to prevent overheating when a heater tips over or has its vent covered by an errant drape.

I tested these protections on each of the WIRED Gear Team's favorite space heaters, roughly knocking heaters over and standing warily by as I swaddled each heater in a cotton sheet atop concrete. Any heater that we recommend performed admirably on these tests, shutting down or modulating its power output to keep from overheating.

The statistics bear out the safety improvements to space heaters: The number of fires due to heating equipment in the United States has dropped by more than 40 percent in the years from 2000 to 2020, according to a study by the National Fire Protection Association.

But heating devices still reward great caution, as do all devices that pull a lot of energy over long periods. The vast majority of residential heating fires start with actual fire, according to the United States Fire Administration—specifically in fireplaces and fuel burners. But portable space heaters nonetheless accounted for more than a thousand fires in the US each year from 2017 to 2019, according to the USFA's numbers.

This accounted for just 3 percent of heating fires overall, but these led to more than 40 percent of fatalities, in part because portable heaters tend to be placed precisely where people live and sleep, and because the resulting fires are far more likely to be unconfined.

So treat your space heater with the caution and skepticism that it deserves. Here are some quite simple space heater safety tips, courtesy of the fine federal experts at the USFA, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), and the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM).

Observe the “3-foot rule.” The CSPC has a simple rule of thumb: Keep your space heater at least 3 feet away from anything flammable—pretty much the same amount of space that's considered courteous between two people during polite conversation. Flammable materials includes bedding, drapes, furniture, the dress you were going to wear, stray socks or stockings, your food delivery bag, and that great book you’ve been reading. Generally, also avoid placing flammable stuff like pillows or drapes in a spot that might potentially fall atop the space heater or drape over them.

Be especially wary of really, really flammable things. Maybe you don't need to be told this. But AHAM recommends that you keep your space heater far, far away from very flammable things like paint, gasoline, aerosols, and books of matches. Heating up things like this with dry air is asking for trouble.",wired

There are some big objects that exist in isolation in space, without either being a star or orbiting one. One of these, SIMP 0136, wanders aimlessly in the Milky Way, about 20 light years away from Earth. It has a mass about 13 times that of Jupiter, and is thought to have the structure and chemical composition of a giant gas planet, though its true characteristics have not yet been determined.

Such untethered objects are typically classified either as “free-floating planets,” which form inside a star system, but are thrown out by the gravitational force of another planet, or as “brown dwarfs,” which form like stars in dense molecular clouds of gas and dust, but lack the mass to undergo stable nuclear fusion like a typical star (for this reason, brown dwarfs are sometimes also known as “failed stars”). It is unclear yet whether SIMP 0136 belongs to either of these categories.

To try to find out more about SIMP 0136’s characteristics, a team made up of researchers from Boston University and other institutions recently conducted detailed observations of the mysterious free-floating SIMP 0136 using the James Webb Space Telescope.",wired
https://wired.com,"Architecture created by the power of soil and communities, rising from the ""non-Western"" -- Pritzker Prize architect Francis Kelle talks about the social role of architecture",https://wired.jp/article/diebedo-francis-kere-interview/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 02:00:00 GMT","Of course, we use materials that are available in the local area, but we place particular emphasis on the ""sociality"" aspect of regaining the confidence and identity of the community.

Originally, the region had its own unique culture and values, and traditional architectural methods rooted in these. However, amid the wave of modernization, we have abandoned it and viewed it as ""old-fashioned.""

Through my projects, people are reminded of ""Oh, we have a culture that we have"" and ""this has meaning."" This will develop self-esteem and help you feel that your past was not wrong. This also gives you confidence in the future. Therefore, I believe it is very important not only to use the materials, but to ""regenerate"" the awareness of the community.

--From the perspective of ""city regeneration,"" Japan once had an architectural movement called ""metabolism."" The ideal was to organically reconstruct cities, but in places like Tokyo where land is already limited and society is mature, it is difficult to put new models into shape. Can the same be said for cities in West Africa, such as Burkina Faso? Or is the situation different?

The visions presented by architects like metabolism are also a great inspiration for us. But looking at the big cities today, the main people who actually make cities are large developers, and their goal is to make as much floor space as possible. Even if an architect views cities as an organic system and tries to design them fluidly, there is very little room for achieving these ideals.

As a result, cities are created at the convenience of developers, not architects. This is the reality of megacities like Tokyo, and unfortunately the current situation has not changed much even in cities in West Africa. The mainstream urban development, like ""cheap copies"" imitating Europe, is the norm, and it is perceived as ""modern.""

But there are architects like me who are in the minority but still trying to show alternatives, and younger generations are beginning to see possibilities there. Africa still has room for development and land. That's why I propose through my own architecture that I will ""connect with nature again and incorporate agriculture and greening into my plans."" Growing crops on school grounds will nourish children and also allow them to interact with nature as part of their education.

In the past, people were constantly saying, ""That's not possible,"" but gradually, as they have achieved results and demonstrated the methods they have put into practice, both Africans and Western architects have come to believe that it will be a hint for solving problems facing the Global South (emerging countries), saying, ""I want to incorporate the Kele method"" now, which is an interesting solution."" If this movement spreads, I think we will be able to see new shapes of cities, not just ""concrete and glass are advanced.""

--What will change in order for such ""non-Western"" architecture to grow significantly in the future?

The basic premise is that we do not deny ""Western"" architecture itself. Glass and concrete can be effective in cold regions, and depending on the climate and situation, it is an important technique, as it may be necessary. Furthermore, it is not a single idea that ""this is the only thing"" and waste energy by relying on heating and cooling. I would like to argue that this is even less sustainable in poor countries and hot regions.",wired

In 2026 the obligation to connect the POS to the cash recorders to improve tax control will come into force.

Increases of contactless and transfers increases

Today, the most widespread digital payment mode is contactless, which represents almost 90% of electronic transactions in stores. In 2024, the overall value of contactless payments reached 291 billion euros, with an increase of 19% compared to 2023. In parallel, innovative solutions such as Digital Wallet and Wearable devices (such as smartwatch, rings, key ring) are becoming increasingly popular, with a total of transactions of 56.7 billion euros.

European countries emit a warning for transgender people",https://www.wired.it/article/stati-uniti-visto-persone-transgender-sesso-trump/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:20:19 GMT","Alert in Europe is growing for direct transgender travelers in the United States. Finland, Denmark and Germany have changed their guidelines for transgender and non -track citizens who wish to go to the United States, following the executive order signed by President Trump in January which recognizes only two genres. The decision arrives in a moment of growing diplomatic tension between Europe and the United States on civil rights, while the cases of European citizens detained at the American borders are multiplying: at least three German citizens have been arrested by the US border authorities in recent weeks, in what international observers consider an exacerbation of the border controls under the new Trump administration.

Which countries have emitted travel warnings to the United States?

Four European countries have so far updated their travel guidelines in response to new US policies. Denmark, which changed its notices last Thursday, advises passport owners with genus X or to those who have changed kinds to contact the US embassy before departure. Finland, intervened about a week earlier, has explicitly warned that the US authorities could deny visas or travel permits if sex on the passport does not correspond to that assigned to birth. Germany has revised its guidelines by underlining the obligation to indicate exclusively ""man"" or ""woman"" in visa questions, recommending preventive checks to travelers with documents that report the X genus. The United Kingdom has also updated its page ""TRAVEL FOR TRAVEL BEAD"" for the United States, although in a less explicit way: without directly mentioning transgender issues, warns that the US authorities rigorously apply, arrest or detention for those who break them.

Which policies adopted Trump towards transgender people?

The executive order signed by Trump on January 20, the day of his settlement, represents only the first step of what appears as a systematic strategy of the administration to limit the rights of transgender people in the United States. The provision imposed on the secretaries of state and national security to implement requirements for the identity documents issued by the United States government, such as passports and views, ""carefully reflect the sex of the owner"", defined by the administration as ""non -modifiable"". In essence, the executive order establishes that sex is determined exclusively by biological characteristics at birth and that ""'sex"" is not a synonym and does not include the concept of ""gender identity"", effectively canceling the most inclusive policies adopted by the Biden administration.

This first measure is part of a wider context of actions that Trump had promised during the election campaign, when he made attacks on the rights of transgender people a central point of his political platform. The president has signed a series of executive orders that aim to exclude transgender people from American military service, reintroducing a policy similar to that of his first term, when he had prohibited the enrollment of transgender people in the armed forces, a ban that then revoked by Biden in 2021. Another measure limits access to sport, in particular as regards the participation of transgender athletes in female competitions. In addition, a third executive order limits gender transition procedures for people under the age of 19, intervening directly on the possibilities of access to gender affirmation treatments for minors. However, many of these measures have already met legal obstacles in American courts, with various civil rights organizations that have presented appeals by contesting the constitutionality of these measures. But Trump is ready to battle: and now entering the United States becomes more and more risky. Unless you have the right passport.",wired

そのベトナムで存在感を高めているのが、日本の東急グループだ。ベトナムの高い成長ポテンシャルに注目した同社は、日本国内での100年を超えるノウハウを活用し、ビンズン省で本格的なまちづくりプロジェクトを推進。現地企業とのジョイントベンチャー「ベカメックス東急有限会社」を通じて、ビンズン新都市を構成する住宅や商業施設、交通インフラといった「街づくり」を包括したパッケージとして輸出するという、総合的な都市づくりに取り組む。

高成長続けるベトナムで開発進むビンズン省

東急グループは、国内では「東急電鉄」などを中心とした移動インフラや、関連地域での不動産、街づくりといった事業を展開する。

ベガメックス東急 設計部 部長を務める釣佳彦氏は、海外でプロジェクトを進める背景として「東急沿線は経済が停滞する日本の中では比較的恵まれており、2035年に総人口のピークを迎える。しかし、老齢化や働き手の減少などは予想されている。一方で世界では、アジアやアフリカで順調な人口増が見込まれている」と話す。東急が成長を続けるため、必要な経済活性が見込めるエリアへのシフトチェンジの必要性を強調する。

東急グループは、シフトチェンジ先のエリアとしてベトナムに注力。東南アジアの中で人口が3番目に多いこと、GDP成長率も安定的に推移していること、今後の成長の継続が見込めることなどが理由にあるという。

「ベトナムの直近のGDPは、住宅販売市場が急拡大した日本の1970～1980年代と非常に酷似している。豊富な働き手がおり、都市部への流入者の年齢も非常に若い」（釣氏）。輸出加工型のみだけでなく、内需型ビジネスとしても魅力的な市場と話す。

開発を進める地域は、神奈川県ほどの大きさの約2700平方kmに約276万人が暮らす、ホーチミン市に近いビンズン省だ。多くの工業団地を抱えるため直近まで安定的な人口増が続いており、ベトナム内での月間平均所得は1位となっている。

また、ホーチミンの中心地からビンズン省は車で約1～2時間だが、直線距離では約30km。交通インフラが整えばベッドタウンとしても期待できる、これからの伸びしろもある街だという。実際にホーチミンからビンズン新都市まで、日本政府の支援でMRT（Mass Rapid Transit：大量高速輸送）およびBRT（Bus Rapid Transit：バス高速輸送）を整備する計画もあるとのことだ。

釣氏は「2024年の12月22日、ホーチミンにMRT1号線がようやく開通した。ビンズン新都市の中心に（交通インフラが）延伸する予定もある」とし、ビンズン省のさらなる価値向上への期待を口にした。

ビンズン省で進む東急流「街づくり」--日本企業と連携して差別化図る

東急グループは2012年、ベトナムの国営企業となるベカメックスIDCと、合弁会社となるベカメックス東急を設立。資本金8兆6000億ベトナムドン（約525億円）、従業員数約400人、東急が65％の出資比率を持つ企業だ。

ベカメックス東急は、総面積約1000haのビンズン新都市のうち街区面積110ha（敷地面積約71ha）を「東急ガーデンシティ（TOKYU GARDEN CITY）」の「Hikari Area」「SORA gardens Area」「MIDORI PARK Area」として開発。約10～15年後の完成を目指して2割ほどを開発しており、街の認知度向上と定住に向けた街づくりを進めているという。

釣氏は、ビンズン新都市における東急の街づくりの特徴として、日本の街づくりを総合的なパッケージとして輸出していることを挙げる。具体的には、マンションなどを1つずつ建築してエリアを開拓していく従来型の街づくりではなく、住宅に加えてサービスなどの周辺環境も付随させる、街そのものとしての開発になるという。

「人口が増えて街が大きくなればなるほど、抱える課題も増える。交通渋滞や都市機能の欠如、脆弱なインフラ…膨らみ続ける課題に対し、日本で街作りのノウハウを培った東急グループならではの対策として差別化できる」（釣氏）

ただし、それらさまざまな課題は日本の街においても、1社単独で解決しているわけではない。東急ガーデンシティにおいても、「すき家」「AEON」といった飲食小売店をはじめとする多分野の日系企業が参画。さまざまな課題を解決できる魅力ある日本の街を再現・発信すべく、日々連携して取り組んでいるという。

連携の一例として、2023年から2024年にかけて、無印良品やパナソニックと共同で「JAPAN HOME」も実施した。憧れて住める日本品質の住環境を提案するイベントになったという。

「東急グループ100年強のノウハウを生かし、日本の街づくりを輸出している。さまざまなパートナーとともに日本の魅力を発信し、地域に根付き、愛される街づくりを推進していく」（釣氏）

詐欺師を邪魔するAIおばあちゃん「Daisy」



提供：Zooey Liao / CNET 提供：Zooey Liao / CNET

Kitbogaが高齢者を守るために詐欺対策活動を始めたように、英国の通信会社O2は詐欺師をこらしめるために理想的な「標的」を作り出した。

その名はDaisy（正式なつづりは「dAIsy」）。白髪にメガネ、そして「Fluffy」という名前の猫を飼っている、典型的な老婦人の姿をしたAIチャットボットだ。声は、従業員の祖母から拝借した。Daisyは家族のエピソードや独特のクセを学習しており、ことあるごとにレモンメレンゲパイのレシピを披露するようにプログラミングされている。

O2は、Daisyの個人情報を意図的にインターネット上に「流出」させた。詐欺師たちはこの情報にとびつき、フィッシング攻撃をしかけた。フィッシングは、無防備な被害者から個人情報を盗み出すサイバー攻撃の一種だ。Daisyの仕事は、詐欺師から電話がかかってくるのを待つことだった。

「Daisyは眠らず、食事もとらないため、すぐに電話に出ることができた」とO2の担当者は振り返る。

Daisyは一度に1件の電話にしか対応できないが、数カ月の間に話をした詐欺師は1000人近くに上った。Daisyは詐欺師がでっちあげたストーリーに耳を傾け、偽の情報を提供したり、できるだけ会話を引き延ばしたりした。O2は、Daisyと詐欺師の会話を分析し、何がうまくいき、何がうまくいかなかったかをもとにAIをさらに訓練していった。

「詐欺師が『ハッカー』と言ったら、『スナッカー（おやつを食べる人）』と解釈するようにAIを訓練した。その結果、ハッカーという言葉を聞くたびに、Daisyはお気に入りのビスケットについて延々と話をするようになった」という。Daisyの長話に詐欺師たちはいらだち、こっけいなほど感情をあらわにするようになった。

「DaisyがAIだと分かっていれば笑い話だ。しかし、実際の詐欺では無防備な高齢者が標的になることが多い。会話が進むにつれて、詐欺師たちはひどい言葉をDaisyに投げつけるようになった」と同社は言う。

O2は詐欺師の手口を多くの人に知ってもらうために、詐欺師を翻弄するスキャムベイティング動画で知られる英国の人気YouTuber、Jim Browning氏の協力を得て、Daisyを開発した。O2の広報担当者によると、Daisyキャンペーンの大きな狙いは、詐欺電話や詐欺メッセージを通報できる英国のホットライン「7726」の認知度を高めることだったという。

Daisyは詐欺師の時間を奪うことに成功したが、O2も認めている通り、それだけでは詐欺やなりすましを減らすことはできない。多くの場合、詐欺の拠点は巨大なコールセンターであり、無数の従業員が昼夜を問わずに詐欺電話をかけているからだ。そのすべてをDaisyのような複雑なボットで食い止めようとすれば、必要なリソースははかりしれない。

Daisyはもう詐欺師をだます活動はしていないが、AIを活用した詐欺対策のプロトタイプとして大きな役割を果たした。O2は今も、この技術の未来に大きな期待を寄せている。しかし、「取り組みの規模を拡大するためには、何万人分もの人格を作らなければならない」とO2は言う。

では、もし何千もの詐欺電話をブロックできるだけのAIボットを用意できたらどうだろう。まさに、これを実現しようとしているのが次に紹介するオーストラリアのハイテク企業だ。

詐欺師をあざむくAI女神「Apate」

ある晴れた午後、Dali Kaafar氏はオーストラリアのシドニーで家族との外出を楽しんでいた。その時、スマートフォンが鳴った。知らない番号だ。普段なら無視するが、今回は遊び心から詐欺師の相手をしてみることにした。

マッコーリー大学の教授で、同大サイバーセキュリティハブのエグゼクティブディレクターを務めるKaafar氏は、何も知らないふりをして詐欺師と44分間も話し続けた。詐欺師の時間を浪費させることには成功したが、自分の時間も無駄になった。もしテクノロジーに詐欺師の相手をさせることができれば、自分の時間を犠牲にすることなく、もっと多くの詐欺師から時間を奪えるはずだ。

この出来事をきっかけに、Kaafar氏はApateを立ち上げた。Apateはテクノロジーを使って詐欺を自動的に検知し、妨害するAIプラットフォームだ。Apateはオーストラリアを中心に、世界の数カ所でボットを運用し、「WhatsApp」などのメッセージングアプリを含む、複数のチャネルで詐欺師を翻弄している。

ある音声クリップでは、Apateのボットが詐欺師の時間を無駄にしている様子を確認できる。AIは世界中のアクセントを模倣できるため、声だけで本物の人間と区別することはほぼ不可能だ。

試しに聞き比べてほしい。どちらがボットか分かるだろうか。

Apateは銀行や通信会社と協力して、詐欺の手口や情報を収集し、各社が詐欺対策を強化できるよう支援している。例えば、オーストラリア最大の銀行CommBankとのパートナーシップでは、同行が詐欺情報を分析し、顧客を保護できるよう支援した。

Kaafar氏によれば、初期のボットは性別、年齢、性格、感情、言語の異なる約120種類のAI人格で構成されていたという。しかし、すぐに規模を拡大する必要があることに気づいた。現在は3万6720のAIボットが稼働しており、その数は増え続けているという。同社はオーストラリアの通信会社と組み、毎日2万から2万9000件の詐欺電話をブロックしている。

しかし、電話を阻止するだけでは十分ではない。コールセンターの詐欺師たちはオートダイヤルを使っているため、1つの番号が塞がれても、すぐに別の番号に発信できる。詐欺対策の網の目をかいくぐり、数の力にものを言わせてターゲットを見つけ出す。

O2は、さまざまなミッションと目的を持ち、本物の人間のように会話ができるAIボットに詐欺師の相手をさせることで、実在の人々がこうむる被害を軽減しているだけだけでなく、詐欺師のデータを盗み、素性を暴くためのワナをしかけている。例えば銀行や金融機関と協力し、詐欺師に特別なクレジットカード情報や口座番号を教える。詐欺師がこのクレジットカードを使ったり、口座にアクセスしたりすると、金融機関はアクセス情報を遡って犯人を特定できる。

Apateの善玉ボットが、詐欺師の悪玉ボットと対決することもあるという。まさに「理想の世界」だとKaafar氏は言う。「Apateのボットが盾となって、人々を詐欺ボットから守っている」

AIにはAIで対抗

AIを犯罪に悪用する話はよく聞くが、金融犯罪と戦う「AIヒーロー」は新鮮だ。しかし、詐欺師の側も着実に勢いを増しつつある。

2025年1月だけで、米国では1日平均1億5300万件ものロボコール（自動音声電話）が発信された。そのうちの何件がAIを悪用して人々から金銭や個人情報を盗み出そうとするものだったのだろう。詐欺の専門家で、ブログ「Frank on Fraud」を運営するFrank McKenna氏によると、2025年末にはほとんどの詐欺がAIやディープフェイクを取り入れるようになるという。

電話を利用した詐欺は、今や巨大な家内工業と化し、数十億ドル規模の経済損失を生み出しているとDaniel Kang氏は言う。Kang氏とイリノイ大学アーバナシャンペーン校の研究者たちは複数のAIエージェントを詐欺師として訓練することで、どれだけ簡単に人々から金銭や個人情報を盗み出せるかを検証した。

2024年の調査では、音声機能を搭載したAIエージェントは、人々から銀行の認証情報を盗み、アカウントに不正ログインし、送金するといったありふれた詐欺であれば自律的に実行できることが証明された。

「AIはあらゆる面で急速に進化している」とKang氏は言う。「政策立案者、国民、企業はまず、この事実を肝に銘じなければならない。そうすれば対策を講じられるようになる」

少なくとも一握りの個人や組織は詐欺に対抗するための啓発活動に取り組んでいる。こうした活動は、詐欺を仕掛けられた時に気づけるという意味では有用だ。しかし、完璧な解決策にはならない。この種の対応では追いつけないほど詐欺行為が増えているからだ。

「チャットボットで行き当たりばったりに詐欺師の時間を無駄にするだけでは足りない。この方法で効果を上げるには詐欺の規模が大きすぎる。チャットボットは優秀なツールだが、それだけには頼れない」とMcKenna氏は言う。

こうした取り組みと並行して、大手のテクノロジー企業や銀行、通信会社も消費者の安全の確保に力を入れるべきだとMcKenna氏は主張する。例えば、Appleは自社のデバイスにAIを組み込むことで、ディープフェイクの検出機能を簡単に実装できるだろう。しかし、多くの企業は法律やコンプライアンス上の問題に巻き込まれることを恐れて、AIの活用に及び腰だ。

「まるでブラックボックスだ」とMcKenna氏は言う。こうした複雑さが詐欺師に有利な環境を生み出し、銀行や金融機関は後手に回っている。

一方、AI技術の進化を利用して高度なサイバーセキュリティを実現し、詐欺の撲滅に取り組んでいる企業も存在する。例えばSardineは、偽の個人情報や他人の個人情報を使った口座開設を検出できるソフトウェアを銀行や小売業者向けに提供している。このアプリはディープフェイクをリアルタイムで検出し、デバイスがボットである可能性が高いと判断すると銀行にアラートを送り、取引をブロックする。

受賞歴のあるサイバー詐欺専門家で、ポッドキャスト「Fraudology」を運営するKarisse Hendrick氏によれば、銀行は顧客の金融データや取引パターンなどの情報をAIと組み合わせることで、ハッキングや窃盗を未然に防げるという。例えば、行動的生体認証を用いて消費者の取引パターンを分析し、外れ値を検知することで、詐欺の疑いがある取引にフラグを立てられる。

詐欺師がAIを活用して悪事を働いているなら、唯一の対抗策は、こちらもAIを使うことだ。「火には火で対抗しなければならない」とHendrick氏は言う。

https://cnet.com,Part 5: Security in the next generation mainframe,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230165/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 06:00:00 GMT","Mainframes still play a key role in an organization's comprehensive strategy for security, reliability and performance reasons. A survey conducted by Kindrill in 2024 on senior IT decision makers and business leaders found that security is the most important feature of the mainframe and the biggest concern when moving from the mainframe. This time, we will introduce the latest mainframe technologies from a security perspective.

Defence and modernization of functionality

Even in mainframe environments, it is essential to implement a multi-layered defense strategy, rather than a single point of defense: comprehensive security measures such as data encryption, host firewall, access control, vulnerability management, patch management, and monitoring and detection. Not only does it improve the level of protection for servers and related devices, it is also necessary to meet overall security requirements based on a comprehensive security policy. Furthermore, even if multiple layers of measures are implemented, the risk of information leakage increases if security requirements and security features are not up to date or if they rely on older features.

Quantum computing to deal with threats

Quantum computers are becoming a reality as an alternative to existing supercomputers. For example, Google developed a new processor chip for quantum computers in December 2024. Quantum computers' powerful computing power makes it almost time-consuming operations that require astronomical time in traditional supercomputers can be completed in just a few minutes.

This suggests that quantum computers may have sufficient computing power to in the future destroy the cryptographic standards underlying the data and infrastructure of modern society. In other words, it is a serious threat to cybersecurity through the misuse of quantum technology. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) points out that advances in quantum computing could lead to the possibility that public key cryptography with a 2048-bit encryption key length will be broken by 2030.

To combat this threat, NIST announced a new encryption standard in August 2024. An example of a system that can use the NIST recommended quantum tolerance algorithms is the IBM z16. IBM z16 protects your data against future threats posed by quantum computer abuse. For example, the Crypto Express 8S (CEX8S) Hardware Security Module, installed in the IBM z16, offers both traditional and quantum-secured cryptography, allowing it to address future threats related to quantum computing, such as attacks that ""stolen data now and attempt to decipher it in the future.""

Companies and organizations need to formulate plans based on the assumption that they will move towards a ""quantum-safe state"" (where information is guaranteed to be secured through data encryption based on quantum mechanics), and implement quantum safety algorithms and protocols in stages. Additionally, data tiering and risk factors must be prioritized to prepare for a transition to quantum-safe state. Specifically, it includes data classification, encryption status checking, cryptographic analysis, cryptographic planning, cryptographic inventory creation, pre-migration steps, transitioning to quantum safe states, and post-migration actions and optimizations.

Quantum cryptography support is required to be completed before quantum computers are put into practical use, and to protect data from threats, with the cooperation of various industries. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether to support quantum cryptography in newly constructed systems or systems that are scheduled to be renewed. In preparation for the future development of encryption technology, there is a high possibility that data re-encryption operations will be required when system renewals, so it is desirable to consider improving operations, such as automating the re-encryption procedure.",cnet

https://cnet.com,This charger has built-in Peltier elements that allow you to wirelessly charge your iPhone while cooling it [Review],https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230883/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:30:00 GMT","Wireless charging is convenient, but its drawback is that it can easily generate heat. This is because unnecessary heat can reduce charging efficiency and have a negative effect on battery life.

Some manufacturers have tried to keep the heat down by installing fans on charging pads. However, it is not very effective during high temperatures, and if you use a case, charging efficiency will decrease.

TORRAS's wireless charger, the PolarCircle Qi2, solved this problem. It has a built-in Peltier element that cools with electricity, allowing you to charge your iPhone while cooling it. It is compatible with Qi2 and sticks tightly with magnetic force, so there is no need to worry about it coming off unexpectedly.

The author took a picture with a thermo camera. The heat generation is suppressed even when charging (Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET). This is what I took with a thermo camera. Heat generation is suppressed even when charging (Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET)

When I touched the charging pad that was connected to my iPhone until recently, I realized that it was completely cold. When I imagined it with a thermo camera, it was cold to around 8 degrees. The fan sound was faint, and I didn't notice it when I put it nearby.



The charging pad is very cold (Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET) The charging pad is very cold (Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET)

There is a button on the side that allows you to turn off the cooling. The connector is USB-C and requires a minimum of 30W of power supply. In other words, you will need an AC adapter or a mobile battery that supports 30W output. The included USB-C to USB-C cable is about 1.5m and of decent quality.

Furthermore, this charger can also be used as a stand. When you lift the ring on the back, you can lean your smartphone at the right angle. This is also rather convenient.

One thing to note is that this charger consumes more power than a regular 15W wireless charger. Powering from a mobile battery reduces efficiency, so if you want to charge it most efficiently, direct cable connection is the best option.

This wireless charger will be especially appreciated for those who play games. I have tried other companies' wireless chargers with cooling fans, but the cooling performance was limited when it comes to fans alone. This machine can be cooled with Peltier elements, so the difference is obvious.

https://cnet.com,iPhone security flaws have existed for several years -- experts point out that Apple's failure,https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230874/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 14:12:00 GMT","It is possible that the issue that allowed iPhone users to risk phishing attacks has been left unattended for a long time. It has now been fixed, but this vulnerability may have existed for several years.

This vulnerability is due to a flaw in the ""password"" app that comes standard with iOS 18. On a security-related page, Apple explained, ""Attackers in privileged network environments could cause sensitive information to be leaked."" Apple says the issue has now been fixed by using HTTPS when sending information.

The bug was first discovered by security researcher Mysk and reported in September 2024, but appears to have been left alone for months afterwards. According to a post on X by Mysk, Apple has been using insecure HTTP by default since the introduction of the ""function to detect leaked passwords"" when it was a password manager, the predecessor of the ""password"" app.

"" iPhone users were vulnerable to phishing attacks for several years, not months. The dedicated Passwords app on iOS 18 was just a repackage of the password manager that was originally included in the Settings app, and it still carried over the previous bugs,"" says Mysk.

However, it is believed that the chances of this bug actually being damaged are very low. This bug has also been fixed in security updates to other products such as Mac, iPad, and Vision Pro.

The caption of the YouTube video published by Mysk shows that the iOS 18 Passwords app opened a link over HTTP, which is not secure by default, and downloaded the account icon. This could have led to an attacker with network access that could eavesdrop and redirect requests and lead them to malicious sites.

According to 9to5Mac, problems appear to arise when attackers intercept and redirect HTTP requests, especially when they are on the same network as the user (such as public Wi-Fi in cafes or airports).

Apple has not provided any comments or additional information on the issue.

Mysk said that discovering the bug did not result in any financial bounties. Apparently this is because the scope and category of the bug were not eligible for bounty.

""It certainly feels like I've volunteered to a $3 trillion company. It wasn't for money, but it's a case of how much Apple rates independent researchers. Since September 2024, I've been trying to convince Apple that this is a bug. It's really good that the fix was fixed and I'll do the same again,"" Mysk said.

Expert: ""It's hardly a small bug""

Georgia Cooke, security analyst at ABI Research, described the issue as ""it's hardly a small bug.""

""It's a big blunder for Apple,"" Cooke said. ""For users, this is a vulnerability that shows the inadequacy of basic security protocols, and is a concern because it has been exposed to long-term attack techniques that are possible with limited skills,"" says Cooke.

However, according to Cooke, it is believed that few people actually encounter this bug. This is because it requires specific situations such as updating your login information with a password manager, manipulating it on a public network, and not noticing the unnaturalness of the redirection. However, since these problems can occur, this can be a catalyst for us to reaffirm how important regular device updates are.

Cooke adds that additional measures should be taken to protect themselves from these vulnerabilities, particularly when using shared networks. Specifically, it is recommended that devices communicate via VPN, avoid important operations such as changing credentials in public Wi-Fi, and do not reuse your password.

The so-called ""chubby filter"" uses a video template from the ""CapCut"" app provided by TikTok's parent company ByteDance, and is used in multiple videos (number of them has not been confirmed). Meanwhile, videos have been posted to TikTok, which criticized the trend and asked him to remove the filter (although this was not provided as a filter feature on TikTok). This is especially because it can damage the body image of teenagers.

Media companies have also been paying attention to the trend, with The Cut and the BBC warning readers about filters, and a writer from Cosmopolitan UK noting, ""When we see these filters appear, it seems the fight against body shaming is still ongoing.""

A TikTok spokesperson told CNET that it had already removed the template in question from CapCut, and that videos using this filter were not displayed on TikTok as recommendations, and that they were also hidden by teen users.

Currently, when you search for this filter, you will see a warning at the top of the search results, ""You are more important than your weight. If you or others are struggling with body image, diet, or exercise, you should know that there is a helping hand and that you are not alone.

https://cnet.com,Oracle has made the new expenses system of MS&AD and two non-life insurance companies common,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230866/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 13:02:00 GMT","MS&AD Insurance Group's Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance and Aioi Nissei Dowa Insurance have launched a new expense system that will be used by approximately 30,000 employees of both companies. Oracle Japan, which provides the system, announced it on March 24th. The system construction is handled by MS&AD Systems, the group's core system company.

With the introduction of the new expense system, the accounting departments of both companies have changed to business processes that are tailored to the standard functions of the system. This reduces maintenance costs compared to conventional in-house development systems. Furthermore, the digitalization of business processes and workflows has made it possible to respond to remote work.

The new system approves settlement applications and issues invoices for shared expenses based on the input data, and the generated journal entries are linked with the financial accounting system. It also enables management of the performance and progress of expenses related to project budgets. This has allowed us to deal with tax reforms, such as the revision of the Electronic Bookkeeping Act and the review of the 2024 entertainment expenses-free system without incurring additional costs.

The system is based on Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (Oracle ERP) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). In addition, ""Oracle Cloud Enterprise Performance Management"" (Oracle EPM) has been newly introduced to improve efficiency in budgeting and performance management of expenses. With the introduction of Oracle EPM, it has become easier to aggregate and visualize data generated within the expense system. Additionally, a subsystem was built with Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle APEX to facilitate transaction references from the general ledger.

実際に同氏が示した10年間の変遷では、2014年にはCDNが85％を占め、サイバーセキュリティが9％、クラウドコンピューティングが6％という構成だったが、2024年にはサイバーセキュリティが51％、CDNが33％、クラウドコンピューティングが16％だった。カテゴリー別の売上推移を見ると、サイバーセキュリティとクラウドコンピューティングが右肩上がりで成長しているのに対し、CDNは2020年以降年々減少しているという。

日隈氏はこの理由について「CDNビジネスのマーケットシェアは維持しているものの、価格競争が厳しくなっていることが背景にあり、売り上げは落ちている」と説明した。一方、2024年度の対前年比成長率は、サイバーセキュリティが16％成長、クラウドコンピューティングが25％成長となっている。

クラウドコンピューティング事業が本格的にスタートしてから約2年だが大きな成長を遂げており、今後の成長領域として注力していく方針だ。とはいえ、サイバーセキュリティ／クラウドコンピューティング共に、CDNのインフラがあってこその事業でもある。同氏は「Akamaiが持っているCDNの超分散型のアーキテクチャーの上に、サイバーセキュリティやクラウドコンピューティングのビジネスが成り立っており、CDNはわれわれにとって非常に重要なインフラだ。CDNがAkamaiの源／源泉であり、今後とも戦略的にしっかりと強化していく」と語った。

最後に、来日していた米Akamai TechnologiesのDirector of Corporate Sustainability ＆ ESG OfficerのMike Mattera氏が「Akamaiのサステナビリティーにおけるビジョンと戦略、2030年に向けたゴール」について語った。

同氏はAkamaiのサステナビリティーへの取り組みとして、2030年までに「温室効果ガスのNet-Zero Emissions（正味排出量ゼロ）の達成」「100％再生可能エネルギーへの転換」「データセンター及び運用におけるエネルギー効率向上」「サプライヤーとの協業によるサステナビリティーの実践」「循環型経済の実現」の5つの目標を達成するとした。

一方で、米国でトランプ政権が発足して以降、サステナビリティーへの取り組みに関しても従来の政策からの転換が行われているとの報道もある。こうした政府の方針について米国社会／米国企業はどのように反応し、今後どのように行動していくのかと同氏に尋ねたところ、方針に変更はないとの回答を得た。以下、同氏の回答を紹介する。

「まず、Akamaiの立場としては、前述の通り2030年までとしたNet-Zero Emissionsや100％renewable Energyに関する取り組み目標に変更はない。この方針は、取締役会や経営幹部の合意であり、会社全体で一貫している。大統領選のサイクルに従って政策が変わり、トランプ政権の発足によってわれわれのビジネスにも影響が生じるのは確かだ。しかし、われわれのサステナビリティーおよび環境への取り組みは政治情勢などの外部要因の影響とは無関係に一貫して継続される。株主、顧客、従業員など、関係者全てが環境に対する取り組みがAkamaiの事業にとって重要だと考えているためだ。確かに政治的な側面からの変化が社会や企業活動にインパクトを与えているが、だとしても前述のサステナビリティーに関する目標はAkamaiの事業目標と深く結びついており、変わることはない」

日隈氏は「Akamaiはグローバル企業であり、米国マサチューセッツ州ケンブリッジに本社を置いてはいるが、売り上げの半分以上は米国以外で生じている。それを考えると、やはり地球規模の課題に対してグローバル企業としてしっかりと取り組んでいかないといけないと考えている」と補足した。

米国政府の政策転換を受け、特に多様性推進のための施策に関しては民間企業の中にも政府に合わせて重視方針を取り下げることを表明した企業もあるが、サステナビリティー／環境問題に関してはそれほど目立った動きはないようだ。もちろん、こうした取り組みをコスト増として捉え、できればやりたくないと考えている企業や組織も存在するだろうが、こうした取り組みの意義を認めている企業では政権が代わって政策が転換しても特に影響はないようだ。政権交代に伴う混乱はしばらく続きそうだが、中長期的な視点に立って最善の道を選ぶ意識が大切だろう。",cnet

副社長の宮本義敬氏は「ユーザー数3万2000人突破」「公開された活用事例が80件超」「活発なユーザー会活動」「国内市場シェア46％」といった状況を紹介し、特徴的な事例として良品計画とパナソニックインフォメーションシステムズでの利用状況を説明した。

良品計画は、「無印良品」ブランドのECサイトにNew Relicを導入。障害発生時に問い合わせを受け付けるコールセンターの非エンジニアの担当者がNew Relicの画面を見ながら状況を把握して一次回答が可能になったことで、バックエンドのエンジニアに問い合わせが振られる回数が減り、コールセンターでの顧客対応速度も向上したという。エンジニアの負担が減ったことでシステム改善に取り組む余裕が生まれた結果、問い合わせ回数が3カ月で約4分の3に削減できたという。

パナソニックグループの中核IT子会社であるパナソニックインフォメーションシステムズは、家電製品などを販売するECサイトの運営を担当しており、サイト内部の構成を可視化して改善するためにNew Relicを活用しているが、特徴的なのはIT担当ではない事業部側に対しても同じNew Relicの画面を使って進捗（しんちょく）報告などを行うことで、「同じ目線に立って問題解決に当たる」ことができるようになったという。

いずれの事例も、もともとはエンジニア向けのツールとして開発されたオブザーバビリティ製品を非エンジニアにとっても使いやすくしようとする取り組みの成果といえる。宮本氏は「New Relicはエンジニアのためのツールとして生まれ、必要なツールをどんどん作っていったのが始まり。それを統合してワンプラットフォーム化したのが5年前で、それによってさまざまな角度で分析できるようになり、非エンジニアの方／ビジネスサイドの方にも活用いただけるようになってきたのを“Observability 2.0”と位置付けている」と説明し、AIの活用によってさらなる進化を目指すという方向性を示した。



New Relic 執行役員 技術統括 兼 CTOの松本大樹氏 New Relic 執行役員 技術統括 兼 CTOの松本大樹氏

技術的なビジョンについて、執行役員 技術統括 兼 最高技術責任者（CTO）の松本大樹氏が説明した。同氏はオブザーバビリティの世界のトレンドとして「いまだ成長過程にあるマーケットである／成熟されていない」「エンジニアのためだけのツールではない」「AIシステムの管理とAIの活用の両輪」の3点を挙げた。

市場の成熟度について松本氏は「成熟されたソフトウェアの領域ではトップのベンダー5社でシェア50％、60～70％に達することも珍しくはないが、オブザーバビリティに関しては5社合計で大体35％。5社のプレーヤーは大体決まっているが、世の中に浸透する余地がある」と語った。このグローバルの状況と、宮本氏が紹介した国内シェア46％という数字を比較すると、New Relicがグローバル以上に日本国内で広く受け入れられていることが伺える。

次に、ユーザー層の広がりについて技術の視点から同氏は「もともとNew Relicの創業者のLew Cirne（ルー・サーニー）がAPM（アプリケーションパフォーマンス管理）というものを作ったのがオブザーバビリティの根源と言われている。これがすごく便利だということでアプリケーション以外のホストやブラウザー、モバイルといったあらゆるシステム領域に広げていったのが最初のフェーズだったが、ツールやデータが増えすぎてサイロ化したものを4年かけて一つのプラットフォームに統合したのがObservability 2.0となった。統合の結果、データを取り出したりデータを連携したりすることが容易になったため新機能のリリース速度が上がり、多くのインサイト（洞察）を得ることができるようになった」と解説した。

こうして、エンジニア以外の人にも活用が拡大した一方、新たな課題も生まれてきたという。「ここまでは『非常に良い変化／進化だ』となったのだが、情報量が多すぎて人間が理解することが難しくなってきたという弊害も見えてきている」とのことだ。同社は、新たな課題を踏まえて「“Observability 3.0”として、これまで以上に民主化をきちんと進め、皆さまがオブザーバリティのツールを使えるようにするために進化させる。具体的にはAIエンジンを強化し、システムの変化や障害を理解／予知することが簡単にできる仕組みづくりに取り組んでいく」というのがAIへの取り組み方針となる。

同社では既に「AI Assistance」としてLLMを活用したアシスタント機能で自然言語でのツールの操作を可能にする機能を2024年にリリースしているほか、APMモジュールでGPUなどのAI向けアクセラレーターを搭載したシステムの性能やリリース状況を監視できるようにもなっている。今後の取り組みとして「Agentic AIを活用できる領域を今後どんどん増やしていきたい」という。

AIエージェントが自律的に他のシステムと情報のやりとりを行うことを想定し、「Agentic Orchestration」としてエージェント連携が可能なパートナーの拡大に取り組んでおり、既にAmazon Web Services（AWS）、Microsoft、Google Gemini、SAPなどとのパートナーシップが発表済みだが、今回新たにServiceNowとの連携についても発表された。この連携によって「New RelicとServiceNowを採用する企業は、企業のワークフローを自動化し、ビジネスのアップタイムを最大化し、収益の損失を最小限に抑えることができる」という。

The Once-Pioneering Giant Now Faces An Uncertain Future As Bankruptcy Looms Over the Company, Intensifying Concerns about What Might Happen to the Genetic Data of 23andme’s Some 15 million Customers.

Best Known for its Saliva-Based Test Kits that offered a glimpse into a person’s genetic ancestry, 23andme has seen its value plumet more than 99% from its $ 6 billion peak since going public in early 2021 after failing to turn.

That Lack of Profit was allocated to Waning Consumer Interest in 23andme’s use-on test Kits and Lackluster Growth of its Subscription Services. The Company Was also Floored by A Huge Months-Long Data Breach That Saw Hackers Steal the Ancestry Data of Almost 7 Million Users Throughout 2023. The Company Agreed in September to Pay $ 30 million to set a lawsuit related to the break.

Less Than a Week Later, 23andme Founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki Said She was “Considering Third-Party Takeover Propals” for the Company. Wojcicki Quickly Walked Back the Stament, Instead Saying She Planned to Take the Company Private. But the damage was done, and all of the company’s independent Board Members Resignéd with Immediate Effect.

After Filing for Bankruptcy Protection in March 2024, The Company’s Assets-Including Vast Banks of Dna Data-Will Be Sold Through A Court-Supervised Sale. Wojcicki also re -registered from the company.

Where does that lead millions of people’s genetic data?

23Andme Bound Largely by its Own Rules

AS Evidenced by its 2023 Data Breach, Which Saw Hackers Steal Information Such As Users ’Genetic Predisposition and Ancestry Reports, 23andme Collects A Ton of Information ON ITS USERS.

If you’re One of the Many Millions that has shipped your saliva to 23andme to Learn About Your Ancestry, You May have assumed that this data will remain private under Law, Such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. HIPAA, AS IT’s Known, Sets The Standards for Sensitive Protecting Health Information from Being Discloseed Without A Person’s Knowledge or Consent.

However, 23andme is not a company covered under hipaa. As such, 23andme is Largely Bound Only by Its Own Privacy Policies, Which it can change at any time.

Andy Kill, a Spokesperson for 23andme, Told Techcrunch that the company believes this is a “More appropriate and transparent model for the data we handle, Rather Than the Hipaa Model Employed by the Traditional Healthcare Industry.”

A LACK OF FEDERAL REGULATION AND A TLOTTERED MESS OF STATE PRIVACY LAWS Ultimately Means that if 23andme faces a dirty, the data of millions of Americans is also on the table. The Company’s Privacy Policy Says That Its Customers ’Personal Information“ May Be Accesed, Sold or Transferred ”as part of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or dirty.

The Fact that Customer Data is a Saleable Asset Has also BEEN MADE CLEAR by Wojcicki, who Reportedly TOLD INVESTORS THAT 23ANDME WILL No LONGER PURSUE ITS-Inteensive Drug Development Programs and Will Instratead Focus On Marketing Its Vast Database of Customer Data to Pharmaceutical Companies Companies and Researchers.

23Andme MAINTAINS THAT ITS Data Privacy Policies WOULD NOT CHANGE IN THE EVENT OF A SALE. These Policies State that the Company Will Never Share Users ’Information With Insurance Companies, or with Law Enforcement Without A Warrant. The Later Have Increasingly Turned to Third-Party DNA Companies for Genetic Information, but 23andme has been resisted all U.S. Law Enforcement Requests for Such Data, According to its long-running transparency report.

Potential Buyers of 23andme May Have Entirely Different Ideas About How To Use the Company’s PotentiaLly Valuble Trove of Dna Data. Privacy Advocates at the Digital Rights Group Electronic Frontier Foundation Have Already URGED 23andm to resist a Sale to Any Company with Ties to Law Enforcement, Warning that Customers ’Genetics Data Could be used by Police to indiscriminate.

“Our commitment to apply the terms of our privacy policy to the personal information of our customers in the event of a dirty or transfer is clear: the 23andme terms of service and privacy state Would Remain in place Unless and Until Customers are presented with, and agree to, new terms and statements - Receiving appropriat notice of any new terms, under applicable data protection laws, ”kill told techcrunch.

Proactively Deleting Your Account

As 23andme faces bankruptcy, there are calls for 23andme customers to take action now to protect their data from being sold.

California’s Attorney General Rob Bonta Said in a stattement after 23andme Filed for Bankruptcy that state residents have a right to demand the deletion of their genetic data under state.

Meredith Whittaker, The President of End-To-End Encrypted Messaging App Signal, Said in a post on x: ""It’s not just you. If anyone in your family gave their dna to [23andme], for all of your sakes, closed your/their account now.""

Eva Galperin, The Director of Cybersecurity at the eff, also warned users to take action. “If you have a 23andme account, Today is a good day to login and request the deletion of your data,"" Said Galperin in a post on x.

Requesting the deletion of your data on 23andme is relatively easy.

Log in to your 23andme Account and Navigate to Settings> Account Information> Delete Your Account. 23andme will prompt you to confirm your decision, warning that deleting your birthday is permanent and irreversible.

There is important cellar. AS not in 23andme’s privacy policy, account deletion is ""subject to retention requirements and certain exceptions,"" which means the company may hold on to some of your data for an unspecified love of time.

For Example, 23andme Will Retain Your Genetic Information, Date of Birth, and Gender “AS Required for Compliance” and will retain limited data related to your deletion Request, “Including but not limited to, your email Address, account deletion Request Identify, communications related to disturbances or complain and legal agrees.

Similarly, if you’ve already agreed to 23andme sharing your data for research purposes, you can reverse that consent, but there’s no way for you to delete that information. Kill Tells Techcrunch that surrounds 80% of 23andme Customers - Roughly 12 million people - Consents to participate in its research program.

DOGE has supplied the agency with spreadsheets, which are to be completed by agency officials, to identify grants and contracts that could be flagged for termination or renegotiation. The department’s acting general counsel, David R. Taggart, outlined the DOE’s DOGE-related procedures in a memo sent on March 17, which was obtained by Axios.

The memo directs political appointees to determine whether grants and contracts are “efficient” or “consistent with DOE policies and priorities.”

Taggart told agency officials that they needed to be brief and consistent when filling out the spreadsheets due to the “heavy litigation environment” surrounding DOGE-related department cuts.

Few corners of the DOE are expected to be immune, according to the memo. Even the DOE’s national laboratory system could be included since each is managed by private companies under contract.

The DOE’s standard contracts contain language that allows the department to terminate an award if it “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”

The memo also appears to give some insight into the way DOGE cuts might be enacted, hinting that there may not be much scrutiny once the spreadsheets leave DOE offices.

Officials are urged to be as granular as possible because lumping awards into groups “might overlook nuances between the covered contracts and grants that might result in terminating efficient agreements or keeping inefficient agreements.”",techcrunch

FuriosaAI, a South Korean startup that makes chips for AI applications, has rejected an $800 million acquisition offer from Meta, opting instead to focus on developing and producing its AI chips, according to a local media report.

Disagreements over post-acquisition business strategy and organizational structure, rather than price issues, caused the negotiations to break down, the report said.

Along with other tech companies building large language models (LLMs) for various AI applications, Meta has been trying to reduce its reliance on Nvidia for chips that are specialized for training and building LLMs. The tech giant last year unveiled its custom AI chips, and in January said it would invest up to $65 billion this year to support its AI initiatives.

FuriosaAI did not respond to a request for comment. Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.

Meanwhile, FuriosaAI is reportedly in talks with investors to raise approximately $48 million (KRW 70 billion), and aims to complete the fundraise this month.

Founded in 2017 by June Paik, who previously worked at Samsung Electronics and AMD, FuriosaAI has developed two AI chips, called Warboy and Renegade (RNGD), to take on the likes of Nvidia and AMD.

The startup has said it has completed testing the RNGD chips, which are said to be best suited for reasoning models, in partnership with LG AI Research and Aramco.

https://techcrunch.com,"Ex-Network International execs raise $6.75M for Enza, an African fintech serving banks",https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/24/ex-network-execs-raise-6m-for-enza/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Over the past decade, Dubai-based Network International has become one of the dominant payment processors across the Middle East and Africa, thanks in part to a pair of acquisitions.

However, many large incumbents can fall prey to slower innovation, opening the door for smaller, faster-moving startups. The latest development is Enza, a fintech founded in 2022 by Hany Fekry, a former managing director at Network, along with another ex-Network executive Hamish Houston.

The fintech, which has raised $6 million in seed funding, is building infrastructure for banks and fintechs, offering a range of local payment solutions, from cards to wallets to real-time payments.

Before launching Enza, the founders managed global acceptance, processing, and consumer finance departments at Network International. While Network was building a robust payments network across the Middle East and Africa, focusing primarily on the acceptance side of things, they felt a massive gap in creating comprehensive solutions for banks and fintechs, especially in Africa.

When neither party could find an alignment with Network, they resigned to start Enza, which officially launched in January 2023.

“Our divergence prompted us to take a step back and rethink how to address these underserved needs in the market,” CEO Fekry told TechCrunch.

The founders of Enza say they’ve built the company using lessons from their time at Network International and its subsidiary, DPO Group. But unlike those firms, which focused largely on card acceptance and merchant acquiring, Enza is taking a broader approach, serving both sides of the transaction.

Enza’s platform is designed for banks and fintechs on the issuing side, and SMEs and merchants on the acceptance side. The startup is initially targeting Egypt, Nigeria, and South Africa, three of the continent’s largest financial markets.

Payments acceptance into broader fintech scale

Payments are often the first entry point into formal finance for the millions of underserved or unbanked small businesses across Africa. Enza wants to help these businesses accept in-person and online payments at little to no cost — a strategy it thinks will allow banks and fintechs to build long-term relationships.

Once those are in place, Enza’s infrastructure enables cross-selling of lending, savings, insurance, and other financial services.

“Payments are the gateway,” says Andrew Key, who joined Enza as an executive director last year. “But the value is in the data and the services you can layer on top.”

That strategy also plays to the changing dynamics between banks and fintechs in Africa. For years, banks have ceded infrastructure and particularly SME market share to players like Flutterwave, Fawry, Paymob, and Moniepoint, now Nigeria’s largest merchant acquirer. But banks still hold key advantages, namely broader service offerings and regulatory backing.

“Banks have realized they gave up too much ground to fintechs,” Houston said. “We want to give them the tech to compete and win it back.”

Similarly, despite the rise of fintechs across Africa, banks remain the central, regulated players behind most payment aggregators. But many still lack clear visibility into what their aggregator partners or downstream merchants are doing.

That’s one of Enza’s functionalities, the founders say: Giving banks more transparency and control over their payment ecosystems so they can stay compliant while scaling.

The Abu Dhabi-based startup also broadens the payment options available to banks. Enza integrates with local card schemes like Verve, AfriGo, and Meeza, alongside global networks like Visa and Mastercard.

It also connects with real-time payment infrastructure, including Nigeria’s NIBSS, South Africa’s PayShap, and Egypt’s InstaPay, as well as mobile money and telco wallets, while supporting QR codes, buy now, pay later (BNPL), and contactless payments features.

Leveraging founders’ networks

Enza is leveraging its founders’ decades of experience and deep relationships across the continent to quickly secure contracts with several banks. For instance, Fekry previously served as chief commercial officer at Emerging Markets Payments (EMP), which was acquired by Network International, where he later became a managing director.

Across their careers, the team has worked with nearly 200 banks. But this time, they’re going for quality over quantity. “We’re not trying to replicate that scale,” Houston said. “We’re targeting 30 to 40 high-quality bank relationships.”

While the company only began operations last year, the Dubai-based fintech has already secured over 10 million monthly contracted transactions through live bank partnerships across six African markets: Rwanda, Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt, Uganda, and South Africa.

Enza charges banks on a per-transaction (“per-click”) basis. Those volumes are growing 35% to 40% month-over-month and are expected to double in the next two years.

The company bootstrapped in its early years, with the founders funding it themselves. When they decided to raise outside capital, the founders said they didn’t shop the deal widely.

Instead, Algebra Ventures and Quona Capital led the $6 million seed round. “The Enza leadership team has an impressive track record of starting, growing, and exiting fintech businesses across the continent,” said Tarek Assaad, managing partner at Algebra Ventures, on why his firm backed the two-year-old fintech.

The new capital will go toward expanding the team and rolling out new products for its banking clientele across Africa.

“We founded Enza to solve real infrastructure problems across Africa,” Fekry said. “We’ve spent our careers trying to make sure our families and communities can access financial products as people in Europe or the U.S. at a low cost and anytime they want.”

https://techcrunch.com,"The Cadillac Optiq EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ go big on tech, luxury, and price",https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/24/the-cadillac-optiq-ev-and-cadillac-escalade-iq-go-big-on-tech-luxury-and-price/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Cadillac’s new IQ portfolio of all-electric vehicles — notably the compact Optiq SUV and grandaddy full-size Escalade IQ — has put the company on a techier, more advanced, and luxurious plane. And the shift couldn’t have come soon enough.

The slate of traditional internal combustion engine vehicles that have come out of Cadillac in recent years hasn’t quite matched the levels of luxury and tech of its rivals.

Cadillac aims to change that with its debut of the compact Optiq SUV as well as the Escalade IQ, which take big swings on tech and advanced features. Importantly, Cadillac gave these two EVs distinct luxury personalities in an effort to appeal to different consumers. Call it the Young and Fun and the Old Money Luxe.

Cadillac let me loose in Northern California over two days to drive the Optiq SUV and Escalade IQ. Here’s how the two newly launched EVs stacked up.

Youthful Optiq SUV

Image Credits:Cadillac

When I learned that engineers from my beloved Cadillac Blackwing had a hand in the Optiq crossover, I was immediately intrigued to see what 300 horsepower and 354 pound-feet of torque would feel like in this all-wheel drive crossover on the twisties.

It’s pretty darn entertaining. Yes, all EVs have smooth power delivery and the ability to accelerate quickly out of corners, but not every one has the suspension to back it up.

The dampers here get what Cadillac calls Passive Plus tuning. While cornering at high speeds the car remains flat and stable, but it can handle broken pavement without getting upset. Essentially, it can react to both slow and quick events to provide handling that is sporty and comfortable, without the complication of electronics. Of course, I’d welcome a future V-Performance Optiq with MagneRide dampers for even more giggles, but for now the hotrod kid in me loves this thing.

If you haven’t carved a canyon in an EV before, it can be a bit different than in a traditional vehicle, thanks to regenerative braking.

The Optiq gives you the ability to turn it off and just rely on the mechanical brakes or keep them at normal for just a bit of slow down when you lift off the throttle. I like maximum regen as it adds another level of skill to lift off the accelerator pedal at the right moment. There’s also a paddle behind the steering wheel that can add regen braking even if the system is set for none. This also can add another skill element for those looking to test their abilities. It’s the gamification of driving.

Escalade IQ, the Electric Land Yacht

Meanwhile, the drive experience in the three-row Escalade IQ is pure comfy goodness. Even though it sports the more advanced MagneRide dampers, those seem to mainly counteract the vehicle’s brutal 9,000-pound heft.

The three-row SUV’s full 700 horsepower and 785 pound-feet of torque are only accessible in a mode called Velocity Max. Otherwise the SUV makes due with 680 ponies and 615 pound-feet of torque going to all four wheels. That might sound like overkill, but this zaftig baby needs it. Anything less and it would feel severely underpowered.

The Escalade IQ is all about smooth, comfortable driving. U-turns are easy thanks to a rear-wheel steer system that makes the 136-inch wheelbase seem much shorter. If you want to arrive in style an Arrival mode lets the Escalade move diagonally into a parking spot. Just be wary of what’s around you as it’s easy to underestimate the angle.

Cadillac also stacked the Escadale with luxury and convenience features. Press on the brake pedal and the doors close automatically. The vehicle also comes with heated seats and a massage function.

And then there is the advanced driver assistance system. Both vehicles get Cadillac’s SuperCruise standard that allows for hands-free/eyes-up driving on 750,000 miles of road.

The system can change lanes when the driver activates the turn signal or it will do it on its own in order to pass a slower-moving car. It was raining and pretty foggy while SuperCruising in the Escalade and though the system hesitated while executing a lane change and a sweeping turn at the same time, it had no problems reading lane markings through the mist.

There are plenty of standard safety features on both EVs as well. Blind-spot monitoring, forward collision alert and braking, lane-keeping assist — all of those features are here.

I especially like the rear camera mirror on both vehicles that gives a wide-angle view of what’s going on behind the car. However, the Escalade IQ goes a step further with standard turn-signal activated camera display. Sure, the blind-spot monitoring is enough, but the video display on the screen that shows the adjoining two lanes is pretty sweet.

Range, range, and more range

Image Credits:Cadillac

The little Optiq has an 85 kWh battery with enough electrons for 302 miles of driving. The 400-volt system can accept a DC fast charge of 150 kW, quick enough to get about 79 miles of range in 10 minutes.

The Escalade IQ, however, goes Gigantor with a 205 kWh battery with 460 miles of range. Like the related Hummer EV, the Escalade’s battery is actually two 400-volt battery packs that can work in series or parallel, enabling a DC fast charge of up to 350 kW and the ability to gain 100 miles of range in 10 minutes. Both are on the CCS charging platform, but a NACS adaptor can be purchased from Cadillac for $225.

For home charging, both EVs come standard with an 11.5 kW onboard charger, but a 19.2 kW system can be had as well. This should enable about 36 miles per hour when charging at home.

Two interior personalities

The interior of the Optiq definitely skews younger and hipper, with recycled materials, a clean look, and some nifty storage solutions.

There is 33 inches of diagonal screen space and a seriously kicking 19-speaker AKG Audio system with Dolby Atmos. The Atmos system is pretty dope, with sounds bouncing around the cabin in a way that delighted even my deficient left ear, to say nothing of my fully functional right ear.

Meanwhile, the Escalade IQ appeals to an older, more sophisticated crowd, but still goes big on tech with 55 inches of screen stretching across the entire dash. The passenger screen can play movies or browse the web, all without disturbing the driver.

There is also a center screen below that’s used for HVAC controls, switching to automatic door controls when the SUV is in park. The two wireless charging pads for the front row are a nice touch. Unfortunately, the Dolby Atmos is not available here thanks to development timelines, but look for it in 2026.

Neither vehicle has Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, instead relying on Google built-in for maps and smartphone interaction.

While I like that Google maps suggests charging stations and estimates remaining range at the end of a journey, I had a hard time setting up Google Assistant to read my text messages. I never got it to work in the Optiq and I had to have an engineer walk me through it in the Escalade, and even then it took a few tries. Once connected my phone posted a notification when I received a text message and allowed a voice-to-text reply, but I didn’t have time to see if it could place a call or play a podcast.

Break out the checkbook

The Optiq is the entry-level EV in Cadillac’s portfolio, starting at $55,615, including $1,495 for destination for the Luxury 1 trim. However, the Monarch Orange paint with the black roof is only available on the Sport 1 and Sport 2 trims and is well worth the extra dollars.

The Escalade IQ is a whole other ballgame. The Luxury 1 trim starts at nearly $130,000, including $2,290 for destination. All paint colors are available across all trims, but the Midnight Steel Frost for $5,925 is a stunner. The most you could drop for a starting price is just over $150,000 for the Sport 2 trim, which has niceties like ventilated second row seats, a 38-speaker AKG sound system, available second row massage and second row executive seat package as well as a thermal camera for night vision.

My time in the Optiq left a positive impression — even if I’m likely a bit older than the intended demographic. The car’s on-road manners appeal to the thrill-seeker in me.

Yes, the Escalade is cool, but it’s more of a lifestyle and status marker, something that doesn’t get me revved up, if you’ll pardon the expression.

Regardless, both offer up some of the best tech in the segment. Safety features are all standard, as is SuperCruise, and the myriad screens give both cabins a futuristic element. I’m not happy with the lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but that is one quibble with what are both outstanding vehicles.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Fair-code pioneer n8n raises $60M for AI-powered workflow automation,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/24/fair-code-pioneer-n8n-raises-60m-for-ai-powered-workflow-automation/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Developer tooling is changing rapidly with AI. So companies that are making it easier to adopt AI in their workflows are seeing a boom of attention. After a startup called n8n (pronounced “enay-ten”) pivoted its workflow automation platform to become more AI-friendly in 2022, it said it saw its revenues increase 5X, doubling in the last two months alone.

Now on the back of that growth, TechCrunch has confirmed that n8n has raised €55 million ($60 million) in funding on a valuation sources close to the company tell us is in the region of €250 million ($270 million).

Berlin-based n8n said it now has more than 3,000 enterprise customers and around 200,000 active users on its books. The startup will be using this Series B to continue investing in tech and to expand in newer markets like the U.S., home to more than half of n8n’s user base. The company does not disclose revenues, and that customer number includes both free and paying users, as well as those taking short-term and longer-term subscriptions.

Highland Europe is leading this latest round, with HV Capital and previous backers Sequoia, Felicis, and Harpoon also participating. Sequoia led the seed round for n8n in 2020; Felicis the Series A in 2021.

The startup, founded in 2019, picked up traction in its early years from developer teams that were looking for low-code and no-code automation solutions to make it easier to stitch applications together in ways without a lot of onerous coding.

It picked up attention for another reason, too: n8n had built a reputation by being closely tied to the concept of “fair code.”

Fair code is a progression of open source. Software developers use open source code for free, but when they want to commercialize work built on top of it, it establishes principles for compensating the open source creators or community. Jan Oberhauser, the founder and CEO of n8n, came up with the idea and runs a site dedicated to fair code.

But while n8n itself is built on fair code and leans into the open source community to grow by word of mouth — it has more than 70,000 “stars” on GitHub — the company says that it was weaving in AI that became its rocket ship.

AI, and in particular generative AI, is a clear complement to automation — something that close competitors like Tines and Workato have also embraced, as have others in the wider automation world like UiPath.

If automation and low-code approaches have erased some of the busy work of pulling together how different apps or services worked together, generative AI brings even less technicality into the mix.

A year and a half ago, Oberhauser said, “we could see this AI thing coming at us.” He quickly surmised that the sweet spot would be to work it into its products, to start to reduce the amount of work it took developers to implement automations by turning instructions into natural language.

“It’s a prompt to build workflow,” is how Oberhauser describes it. “People don’t really need to write 50 lines of code to integrate the functionality of, say, sending an email.” Now in natural language, you can write “get information from X and send it to Y,” he said. “We see the value in making changes to that more easily.”

The product was built with a blend of LLMs in mind, and the idea is that if end users are already building services using one LLM or another, it can be swapped in to work with n8n’s platform. And like a number of other developer-focused platforms, n8n has a fairly extensive contributor community that is active on platforms like GitHub, gets involved in forums to help other developers with their questions, and builds and uses workflow templates built by others (n8n also has pre-built a number of workflow templates).

Even with all the hype and hope around artificial intelligence and GenAI these days, the AI-powered version of n8n took a while to stick, with virtually no take-up at all at first. Then last year, there was a sudden a tipping point.

Why? Perhaps the weight of a couple of trends coming together. There was the burst of chatter around AI in coding, with companies like Poolside, Codeium, and Magic all raising big money within months of each other. And then within end users themselves, the chant to figure out how to use AI also became louder.

But there is a lot of hype and talk out there, too, and so ultimately n8n’s ease of use and usefulness seems to be what has sealed the deal with users, but also investors.

“Everyone is trying to leverage AI but struggling to find practical use cases,” David Blyghton, the general partner at Highland who led the round, told me over a phone call. “The design, scale, and throughput of n8n is what allows people to adopt it.”

Oberhauser admits that although “it took a while for the market to catch up,” now he says that around 75% of all of n8n’s customers are using the AI tools they have built.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,AI creation platform Arcade expands from jewelry to home goods,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/24/ai-creation-platform-arcade-expands-from-jewelry-to-home-goods/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Arcade, a generative AI marketplace for designing jewelry, is expanding its offerings to include home goods, starting with rugs.

The company on Monday also introduced a new feature called “Match My Room,” which allows users to upload a photo of their room so their design complements the existing colors and style.

Alongside this expansion, Arcade announced its $25 million Series A funding round, bringing the total amount raised to $42 million.

Similar to Arcade’s jewelry design generator, the rug creation tool leverages Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. Users select the rug material and then enter a text prompt to describe the desired design. Once the design is generated, it’s then paired with a manufacturer, who will send the creator a free sample for approval before purchasing.

Based on our testing, rugs start at around $400 for a 3×9 hand-tufted wool option, which is the most affordable material. Prices increase for higher-end materials such as cashmere, alpaca, and mohair. However, Arcade claims to offer more affordable options than luxury rug retailers that charge thousands of dollars.

The “Match My Room” feature allows users to upload a photo of their space. While the AI analyzes color matching, it can’t successfully replicate patterns from other decor items in the image, like pillows and blankets. Overall, though, it’s a useful tool for ensuring the rug’s color accents tie in with other furniture.

For users looking to create designs for pure enjoyment, Arcade offers “Dream Boards,” which function similarly to Pinterest boards, showcasing products with similar themes, such as Hollywood-inspired earrings. Users can also browse other Dream Boards and make purchases.

Additionally, Arcade has a seller program, allowing people to earn a 5% commission for each sale of their product, an increase from the previous 2.5%. Users can earn even more by joining Arcade’s affiliate program.

The company recently launched a new entrepreneur program aimed at helping content creators unlock higher commission rates. Major media outlets and influencers with over 25,000 followers are encouraged to sign up by emailing Arcade’s marketing team.

Despite launching its beta jewelry offering only in September 2024, Arcade claims to have generated 650,000 jewelry designs. But the company didn’t disclose how many users are interested in purchasing these designs, nor has it revealed the commission earnings of sellers.

Arcade is spearheaded by Mariam Naficy, who previously founded cosmetics retailer Eve and design marketplace Minted.

The Series A round was led by Laura Chau (Canaan Partners), with participation from Kirsten Green (Forerunner).

The new capital will be allocated toward hiring, platform development, and introducing new product categories like ceramics and pillows. Naficy has previously mentioned to TechCrunch that additional categories may include apparel and leather goods. According to its website, chain belts are also next.

Arcade previously raised $17 million from Ashton Kutcher (Sound Ventures), Offline Ventures, and Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn co-founder). Other investors include Inspired Capital, Torch Capital, and David Luan, CEO of Adept AI Labs and former vice president of engineering at OpenAI, among others.",techcrunch

U.S. Treasury officials have lifted sanctions on Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer that the U.S. government previously said was used to launder $7 billion worth of crypto stolen by North Korean hackers.

In a statement, the Treasury said it “exercised our discretion” to delist Tornado Cash following a legal battle. Sanctions make it illegal for Americans or U.S. businesses to transact with a listed entity.

Crypto mixers allow customers to conceal where their crypto came from, including tainted or illicit funds, by blending the funds with other crypto.

In 2022, the Treasury accused the “notorious” Tornado Cash of laundering stolen crypto from hacks carried out by North Korea, whose goal is to steal crypto to fund its nuclear weapons program. In August 2023, the two founders of Tornado Cash were criminally charged in a New York federal court, accused of conspiracy to launder money and sanctions violations.

The Treasury said following its delisting of Tornado Cash that it remains “deeply concerned” about the threat of crypto hacks from the North Korean regime.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Revel opens first EV fast-charging hub in San Francisco,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/24/revel-opens-first-ev-fast-charging-hub-in-san-francisco/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Brooklyn-based electric vehicle charging infrastructure startup Revel on Monday launched its first fast-charging station in San Francisco, kicking off its plans to expand across the Bay Area over the next year.

“For years, Revel has operated the largest, fastest, and most reliable fast-charging network in New York City,” Frank Reig, co-founder and CEO of Revel, said in a statement. “Now we’re bringing our model to the number one EV market in North America.”

The Bay Area has some of the highest rates of EV ownership in the country. In 2024, more than 35% of new vehicle sales in San Francisco were electric, compared to the national average of around 8%.

Revel’s first West Coast charging station is in the city’s Mission District, and it features 12 chargers with 320 kW capacity, built by EV charging company Kempower. Like Revel’s stations across New York City, these will be publicly accessible 24/7 to any make and model of EV.

The company said it has plans to add more than 125 chargers to the urban centers of San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, and South Francisco over the next year.

San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who cut the ribbon at Revel’s opening Monday, said the new chargers will make it easier for residents to make the switch to EVs.

Revel’s San Francisco launch comes a week after the startup opened 24 new chargers at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, located within the airport’s for-hire vehicle hold lot.

Last month, Revel secured a $60 million loan from New York’s clean energy investment fund NY Green Bank to more than triple its fast-charging network in the city. The company said it hopes to expand to 300 chargers in New York by the end of this year, including a 60-stall site in Maspeth, Queens and a 48-stall site outside of LaGuardia Airport.

“Our mission at Revel is to bring reliable fast-charging to dense urban areas where EVs can have the biggest impact on quality of life, but where charging is hardest to come by,” Paul Suhey, co-founder and COO of Revel, said in a statement.",techcrunch

After nearly 10 years as a board member and investor, he is now leading Gloo's product and engineering efforts, with a focus on building a vertical cloud platform for the faith ecosystem.

""Effective today, I have been named Gloo's executive chair and head of technology,"" Pat Gelsinger wrote on LinkedIn. ""I have been involved with Gloo for almost 10 years, both as a board member and investor. Gloo's focus on creating a technology platform that connects and catalyzes the faith ecosystem perfectly aligns with my own sense of purpose.""

Among the first projects that Pat Gelsinger will lead at Gloo will be the creation of one of the first vertical industry clouds for faith and advanced values-aligned AI. Earlier this year Pat Gelsinger praised DeepSeek and announced that Gloo would use it over OpenAI’s models for its AI chatbot Kallm, due to its open-source nature and ease of integration. Despite controversy surrounding DeepSeek's data practices, allegations of distilling ChatGPT data, and using Nvidia's smuggled GPUs to train its models, Gelsinger noted its affordability and potential to push the industry toward more open, efficient AI development.

""Across all of our efforts we are deeply committed to open-source, trust through transparency and benchmarking, and licensing of content for training and use of AI,"" Gelsinger wrote. ""I see tremendous opportunity ahead for Gloo and I couldn’t be happier to partner with CEO Scott Beck and the rest of the leadership team as we prepare for our next phase of growth. I will have a few more updates to share on this new chapter in the coming days. Gloo will be a major focus… but there is a bit more to come.""

Gloo is a tech company that builds tools and platforms to support churches, ministries, and faith-based organizations. Its main goal is to help these groups connect better with people, grow their communities, and use new technologies like AI in ways that align with their values.

For now, Gloo offers a digital workspace for ministry leaders to organize content, communication, and outreach efforts, as well as AI-powered tools to enable churches to better engage with their members and reach new people. In addition, Gloo works to connect faith organizations and distribute content from Christian publishers and media to churches and individuals.

""Now more than ever, there is great need for faith-based communities to take an active role in ensuring we shape technology as a force for good,"" Gelsinger wrote. ""As we have seen with social media, the impact of technology evolutions is swift, deep and long lasting. AI is an even more powerful yet nascent tool. It is imperative we ensure AI is used to enhance the human experience, not harm it.""",tomshardware

https://tomshardware.com,This scent-dispensing RX 9070 XT assures at least one GPU launch this year doesn't stink,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/this-scent-dispensing-rx-9070-assures-at-least-one-gpu-launch-this-year-doesnt-stink,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:48:50 GMT","AMD's latest Radeon RX 9070 series is among the best graphics cards gamers can purchase. Thanks to Yeston, they may also be among the best-smelling graphics cards around, as the company has integrated fragrance dispensers in Team Red's RDNA 4 offerings.

Computer hardware manufacturers have long been adding RGB lighting to every component they can think of. That trend going away anytime soon, but a few companies seem to have locked on to another trend: scented hardware. We've already encountered laptops, mice, and even thermal pastes that emit pleasant scents. It makes some sense in the first two cases, since you tend to work for long hours on your laptop, or your hands become sweaty after a while. However, fragrance-infused thermal paste feels more like a gimmick.

Yeston has taken fragrance antics to another level by adding a fragrance dispenser tucked into the shroud of its Radeon RX 9070 graphics cards. The brand describes the Sakura Atlantis Radeon RX 9070 XT as having an ocean-themed fragrance, while the Sakura Radeon RX 9070 XT has a more floral scent.

Image 1 of 4 (Image credit: Yeston) (Image credit: Yeston) (Image credit: Yeston) (Image credit: Yeston)

The fragrance of the Sakura Atlantis Radeon RX 9070 XT supposedly resembles the ocean, but as with all scents, the aroma is subjective. The Gamers Nexus team conducted a sniff test of the fragrance module using different noses. The general consensus was that it smells like a car air freshener, a free perfume sample kiosk from a mall, clean laundry, perfume, and fabric softener.

Yeston placed the fragrance module inside the graphics card's shroud, near one of the cooling fans. When the fan starts spinning, it will blow the scent out of the graphics card, making your entire computer case smell pleasant. The intensity of the aroma will depend on how many exhaust fans you're operating in your system, as this will determine how effectively the scent circulates in your room.

While the feature sounds cool, its implementation falls short. To access the fragrance module, you have to disassemble the entire graphics card, which could be a tedious process, even for tech-savvy users. It's just a question of when you'll have to replace the fragrance module because it won't smell forever. We've contacted Yeston to inquire whether the company provides replacements and at what cost.

Yeston's Sakura lineup has always embraced ananime theme, with vibrant pastel colors. The design is primarily centered around a waifu, reminiscent of the old ATI Radeon days when Ruby was featured prominently on the graphics card shrouds. While the waifu theme may not appeal to everyone, it's always refreshing to see manufacturers create new designs.

The Sakura Atlantis Radeon RX 9070 XT and Sakura Radeon RX 9070 XT share identical specifications. Therefore, the performance of both graphics cards is the same, with the only differentiating factors being the design and price tag.

The graphics cards offer a 5% higher game clock and a 3% higher boost clock than a reference Radeon RX 9070 XT. The graphics card requires three 8-pin PCIe power connectors and supplies three DisplayPort 2.1a outputs and one HDMI 2.1b port.

While Yeston has launched many Sakura graphics cards in the past, the latest custom Radeon RX 9070 XT models appear to be the first to carry the fragrance module. The company hasn't revealed any custom GeForce RTX 50-series (Blackwell) graphics cards yet, which seems to be a bit uncharacteristic of the brand since it has always offered products from both AMD and Nvidia.

The Sakura Atlantis Radeon RX 9070 XT retails for $949 but has been discounted to $899. Meanwhile, the Sakura Radeon RX 9070 XT normally costs $899 but can now be found for $869. Unsurprisingly, neither model is in stock. Yeston has released a statement that it expects the Radeon RX 9070 XT supply to stabilize after April.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Ant Group reportedly reduces AI costs 20% with Chinese chips,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/chinese-fintech-company-uses-domestic-semiconductors-for-ai-breakthrough,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 15:14:07 GMT","Ant Group, the financial technology giant backed by Alibaba, has announced a major achievement in artificial intelligence (AI) by successfully training a model using domestically produced semiconductors. According to Bloomberg, a source said that Ant Group leveraged chips from Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Huawei to train its AI model, reaching performance levels comparable to those obtained with Nvidia’s H800 chips. A key highlight of Ant Group’s achievement is a reported 20% reduction in costs compared to using Nvidia hardware.

While Ant Group continues to utilize Nvidia’s hardware for certain AI development tasks, the company is now relying increasingly on alternatives — particularly chips from AMD and Chinese manufacturers — for its latest models. This strategic pivot reflects a broader trend within China’s tech industry, driven in part by tightening U.S. sanctions that limit access to Nvidia’s most advanced GPUs.

This development demonstrates China’s growing AI capabilities and suggests that domestic and non-U.S. alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs are becoming viable for large-scale AI training. A key highlight of Ant Group’s achievement is a reported 20% reduction in costs compared to using Nvidia hardware. High-performance AI training requires substantial computational power, and Nvidia’s GPUs have long been the gold standard in the industry. However, with access to Nvidia’s chips increasingly constrained, Chinese firms have ramped up investments in their own semiconductor technologies and diversified their hardware sources.

This also raises comparisons to China’s DeepSeek AI, which recently outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-4 on certain benchmarks. If Ant Group’s breakthrough represents a similar leap in AI training efficiency, it could mark another step toward reducing reliance on Western technology. However, questions remain about whether Chinese chips and alternative suppliers like AMD can scale effectively and whether they can match Nvidia’s long-term performance and ecosystem support.

While specific details about the chips used in Ant Group’s AI training remain undisclosed, reports suggest that Alibaba’s in-house AI hardware and Huawei’s Ascend series chips played crucial roles. If other Chinese firms can replicate these results, it could accelerate China’s AI ambitions and lessen the country’s dependence on foreign technology.

Whether these domestic and alternative AI chips can maintain competitiveness in the long run remains an open question. But this development is a clear indication of China’s push toward technological independence.",tomshardware

Today we're sharing a really cool creation put together by Dan McCreary that uses a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 to drive a custom FFT sound spectrum analyzer . This gadget provides real time visual output of soundwaves and best of all, you can make it yourself!

Spectrum Analyzer using FFT running on Raspberry Pi Pico 2 - YouTube Watch On

If you're not familiar with the term, FFT stands for ""Fast Fourier Transform"". This is an algorithm that can be used to take sound data from input devices like microphones and transforms it into a visual sound wave that you can see in real time on a screen. With a little bit of tweaking, this project can be modified to work for other systems too like radars.

McCreary was kind enough to share plenty of details about how this project works and what its current limitations are. In the project description, he goes on to explain that the FFT analyzer operates around 17 milliseconds. The algorithm was created to work in ARM assembler using an FFT library created by Peter Hinch.

Like we mentioned before, the main board powering the project is a Raspberry Pi Pico 2. The Pico is connected to a 2.42-inch I2C OLED display which has a resolution of 128 x 64px and relies on the SSD1306 driver to operate. For audio input it uses a microphone that is capable of providing 8K samples per second.

The code for the project was created using MicroPython. Over at GitHub , McCreary has shared details on how to recreate the project. In it, he breaks down the hardware setup as well as everything you need to build the FFT analyzer system. McCreary also shared a video to YouTube showing off the creation process as well as the final build in action.

If you want to get a closer look at this Raspberry Pi project , check out the project page shared to GitHub and YouTube for more details. There you'll find not only details about its construction but also steps and additional resources for developing your own FFT system from scratch.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,U.S. asks Malaysia to 'monitor every shipment' to close the flow of restricted GPUs to China,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/u-s-asks-malaysia-to-monitor-every-shipment-to-close-the-flow-of-restricted-gpus-to-china,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 13:15:00 GMT","Ever since the U.S. government restricted sales of advanced AI and HPC processors to China, Chinese entities have used various loopholes to acquire Nvidia's GPUs. Smuggling GPUs from nearby countries to China was one of the easiest ways to get the desired processors, but it looks like it is not going to be that easy anymore: Singapore is cracking down on at least some smugglers, and now Malaysia is tightening oversight of its high-tech exports to China, reports the Financial Times.



Malaysia is reportedly preparing stricter rules for its high-tech sector due to U.S. concerns that advanced processors are being funneled to China, violating American export laws. The United States has asked Malaysia to carefully follow the path of high-performance Nvidia processors entering the country. U.S. officials suspect that many of these chips are being routed to China, bypassing export limits meant to curb Chinese progress in AI and military capabilities. Malaysia formed a task force to tighten oversight, with particular focus on Nvidia hardware used for training of advanced large language models.

Malaysia's trade minister, Zafrul Aziz, said the request came directly from Washington. He confirmed that a joint task force, including digital minister Gobind Singh Deo, had been created to strengthen oversight of the local datacenter industry, which depends on Nvidia's hardware.

Zafrul explained that the U.S. wants guarantees that the GPUs are installed in the local datacenters and not redirected elsewhere, specifically to China. He said the U.S. is also urging manufacturers and others in the supply chain to share responsibility for ensuring Nvidia processors reach approved destinations.

Unlike Singapore, Malaysia is not a major hub of Nvidia GPUs sales, but it looks like the U.S. does not want to give smugglers any chances. Singapore has become increasingly important to Nvidia’s global operations, contributing 18.14% of its revenue in the fiscal year 2025. This is a sharp increase from 8.5% in the fiscal year 2024, when major restrictions on selling AI GPUs to Chinese buyers were first implemented. Despite the surge, Nvidia states that most of these Singapore-related transactions involve goods being shipped to destinations other than China. The company explains that its revenue figures are based on the location to which customers are billed, which does not necessarily indicate where the products are ultimately used.

Malaysia has recently seen rapid growth in its datacenter industry, especially in Johor state. In the past year and a half, over $25 billion in investment has flowed into the region from companies including Nvidia, Microsoft, and ByteDance.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Samsung launches its glasses-free Odyssey 3D monitor — 27-inch 4K OLED G8 and 144 Hz G9 variant now also available,https://www.tomshardware.com/monitors/samsung-launches-its-glasses-free-odyssey-3d-monitor-27-inch-4k-oled-g8-and-144-hz-g9-variant-now-also-available,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:55:00 GMT","Samsung Electronics is lifting the veil off its latest lineup of monitors which it showed off at CES earlier this year. The Odyssey lineup sees a new addition in the form of a glasses-free 3D gaming monitor, alongside Samsung's first high-density 27-inch 4K OLED offering, and a new 49-inch variant under the G9 family, supposedly designed to be more accessible. However, official prices have not been listed as of writing.

Under the new Odyssey 3D sub-brand, Samsung is debuting the G90XF which is a 4K, 27-inch monitor that boasts a 165 Hz refresh rate, designed to deliver a convincing 3D effect without the need for traditional 3D glasses, also known as an autostereoscopic display. The panel technology is currently unspecified. Samsung achieves this 3D effect through a combination of advanced eye-tracking, a light field display, and lenticular lens tech on the front panel that direct light rays at different angles to create a perception of depth.

Samsung recommends installing the Reality Hub software, which can transform select games to give you an immersive 3D experience. The G90XF also packs an AI video conversion tool that harnesses your GPU's (Nvidia-only) power to convert 2D videos or movies to 3D on the fly, as long as the content is not DRM-protected, much like Nvidia's RTX HDR and VSR technologies.

Next up is a new refresh of Samsung's Odyssey G8 OLED monitor dubbed G81SF. The G81SF carries a 4K QD-OLED panel running at 240 Hz, available in 27 and 32-inch options, with a DisplayHDR TrueBlack 400 and a Glare Free certification from Underwriters Laboratories (UL). Samsung is a tad late to the party, as similar high pixel-density offerings from Asus, MSI, and Dell are already available in the market. The 27-inch flavor offers a pixel density of 166 pixels per inch, currently the highest in the industry for this size, matching other competitors.

For heat dissipation - needed to cool this high-performance display - Samsung advertises the use of its proprietary Pulsating Heat Pipe (PHP) based technology. PHP is claimed to diffuse five times more heat than standard Graphite sheets.

Following is Samsung's Odyssey G9 G91F which aims to bring ultrawide gaming to the masses. Compared to the original model, which launched in 2020 at nearly $1,500, the G91F cuts down on several specifications to save costs. While the monitor retains its staple 49-inch dual QHD panel, it drops the refresh rate to 144 Hz and the HDR specification to DisplayHDR 600, a step back from the original's 1,000 nits of peak luminance. Although you do get HDR10+ certification which is a welcome addition.

Lastly, professionals can expect to see Samsung's new ViewFinity S8 (S80UD) hit shelves shortly. This monitor carries a large 37-inch, 4K display with a 16:9 aspect ratio alongside Ergonomic Workspace Display and Intelligent Eye Care certifications from TUV. Devices can be connected through a 90W USB Type-C connection, while you can plug in peripherals via the included KVM switch.

https://tomshardware.com,Raspberry Pi's new PoE+ Injector supports all generations of PoE HATs,https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pis-new-poe-injector-supports-all-generations-of-poe-hats,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:39:09 GMT","Power over Ethernet (PoE) is nothing new to the Raspberry Pi. Introduced with the Raspberry Pi 3B+, PoE provides power over a network connection and is handy for installing a Raspberry Pi in a remote or awkward location. The new $25 Raspberry Pi PoE+ Injector may not be the PoE HAT+ that we have been waiting for since the launch of the Raspberry Pi 5, but it is a step on the journey towards it.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Raspberry Pi PoE Injector Specifications Supported Data Rates 10/100/1000 Mbps Input Voltage 100 - 240V AC via IEC cable Output Power 30W Nominal Output Voltage 55V DC Dimensions 159 x 51.8 x 33.5mm

The Raspberry Pi PoE Injector is a Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) device that injects power into a non-PoE switch, to a Powered Device (PD) such as any model of Raspberry Pi since 2018 (not including the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W).

Supporting IEEE 802.3af (PoE 13W) and IEEE 802.11at (PoE+ 25W) standards, the Raspberry Pi PoE Injector has enough power for the Raspberry Pi 3B+, 4. With 25W it could also power the Raspberry Pi 5 as it up to the necessary 30W of power.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

But all of this power is nothing without a PoE or PoE+ HAT and while the Raspberry Pi 3B+ and Raspberry Pi 4 may have their own PoE HATs, they are not compatible with the Raspberry Pi 5 due to the relocation of the PoE pins. On the Raspberry Pi 4 they are in the top right of the board, next to the Ethernet port. But, with the Raspberry Pi 5 relocating the Ethernet port to the bottom right, the PoE pins have also migrated.

The Raspberry Pi 5 is currently bereft of a PoE board, something that Raspberry Pi co-founder and CEO mentions in the official blog post. Upton claims that the Raspberry Pi 5 compatible PoE+ HAT+ is in the ""final stages of development"" and is claimed to be ""our smallest, most efficient PD accessory"" and based on the early prototypes. We eagerly wait for it to be launched.

If you can't wait, and you have a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5, then Pineboards already has a PoE enabled board. The Modulo5 IO PoE+ just needs PoE power (perhaps from the Raspberry Pi PoE+ Injector?) and you are ready to go! There are also other third-party PoE HATs for the Raspberry Pi 5 including boards from Waveshare and Uctronics.

The Raspberry Pi PoE+ Injector is on sale now for $25 via the Raspberry Pi approved reseller network.",tomshardware

Claimed to be the ""world's smallest LEDs,"" a blog post shared by Zhejiang University says that the new 'nano-PeLED' pixels can be packed close enough to create displays with a stunning 127,000 pixels per inch (PPI). Current micro-LED technology struggles with efficiency issues at pixel sizes below 10µm (about 111x larger than 90nm) which high-end AR/VR applications can benefit from.

Physicists, engineers, and photonics experts from the aforementioned Zhejiang University in China and the University of Cambridge in the UK collaborated on this advance, which is said to be reliant upon perovskite. Readers may be more familiar with this material due to its widespread use in solar panels. Here it is instrumental to the fabrication of the new nano-PeLEDs.

Zhejiang University researchers highlight that the new micro- and nano-perovskite LEDs (micro/nano-PeLEDs) could become the ""ultimate technology"" in producing the tiniest pixels. There are a number of positive aspects to nano-PeLEDs which should propel take-up of this technology. For example, it is claimed that these new LEDs are more economical to make than LEDs reliant on other technologies, perovskite tech is claimed to deliver higher efficiency, and we have the headlining incredibly tiny LEDs that it makes possible.

""Currently, the most advanced technology for display applications is micro-LEDs… based on III-V semiconductors,"" said Prof. Zhao Baodan of Zhejiang University. Baodan explained that these micro-LEDs have been popular in cutting-edge augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications. However, in these applications, smaller is still better, and pixel sizes smaller than 10 micrometers are desirable for high-end AR/VR applications with ultra-high resolutions. This is where nano-PeLEDs can step in, as ""the efficiency of micro-LEDs drops rapidly"" when the pixel sizes go below that threshold.

The researchers also gave some insight into creating these microscale perovskite LEDs. ""Conventional photolithographic processes are not suitable for the direct patterning of the perovskite layers – it would damage the perovskite materials, so that we have to pattern the other functional layers instead,"" explained Lian Yaxiao, one of the authors of the paper, recently published by Nature. If you are interested in this technology and want to go deeper, we recommend you follow that link.

Last but not least, there is the eternal question of commercialization of such breakthrough technology. The scientists have already started to work with LinkZill, a Hangzhou-based tech company commercializing thin-film transistor (TFT) technologies, to create a programmable circuit to drive the new displays. They also have a prototype active-matrix micro-PeLED display ""driven by a TFT backplane, [and] capable of showing complex images and video clips.""",tomshardware

The G34WQCP is a VA panel which means high native contrast. Most screens of this type do well to top 3,000:1, but this one hits 5,000:1 without dimming or other trickery. That means deep black levels, bright highlights and a picture with palpable texture. It also bodes well for HDR content which can never have enough dynamic range to show its full potential. The G34WQCP doesn’t employ zone or field dimming but still delivers superb HDR.

The picture is further enhanced by wide gamut color. There are no Quantum Dots here, but I measured a tick over 90% coverage of the DCI-P3 gamut. With excellent out-of-box accuracy, you can expect vivid and natural color for both SDR and HDR content. Resolution is 3440x1440, AKA WQHD, meaning pixel density is a pleasing 109ppi. It delivers high frame rates with no visible dot structure.

On the video processing side, the G34WQCP runs natively at 180 Hz with an overclock that delivers 190 Hz. I ran my review sample at full speed for many long gaming sessions without a hiccup. A well-optioned overdrive offers three fixed levels and a smart option that varies the overshoot with changes in frame rate. I found this less precise than some which resulted in a few minor ghosting artifacts. You also get a backlight strobe option called Aim Stabilizer. Adaptive-Sync works perfectly with both G-Sync and FreeSync. The G34WQCP has not been certified by Nvidia.

Gigabyte keeps the price low with a few exclusions but nothing significant. There are no USB ports or LED light bars. But there are internal speakers, two each of DisplayPort and HDMI inputs and GameAssist which offers aiming points, timers and a frame counter. There is no corner cutting on build quality which is solid. The stand and panel are a stable and rugged package that look well suited for long term use.

The best part is the G34WQCP’s price at this writing of $350. Curved monitors are no longer premium items, but you won’t be sacrificing any performance or functionality here. This level of look, feel and performance would have cost you $800 just a few years ago.

Assembly and Accessories

The G34WQCP’s three main parts come out of large blocks of crumbly foam to assemble with the help of a Phillips-head screwdriver, which you’ll need to have on hand. The panel bolts to the stand using a standard 100mm VESA mount. The included fasteners are long enough to accommodate aftermarket arms if that’s your preference. The power supply is internal, so Gigabyte has provided three different cords for different wall plugs. You also get DisplayPort and HDMI cables.

Gigabyte keeps the G34WQCP’s styling simple and functional. The front view is all screen with thin flush bezels around the top and sides and a wider trim strip at the bottom sporting the Gigabyte moniker. There’s no visible power LED but when powered up, a soft light is projected onto the desktop. You can turn this off in the OSD.

In the back are a few subtle shapes set off in a gloss finish contrasting with a smooth matte background. There are no LEDs here. Only a larger “Gigabyte” breaks up the continuous taper from side to side. Ventilation is on top and is generous. There are no internal fans required here.

The stand is a squat and solid piece with 5/20 degrees tilt and five inches of height adjustment. There is no swivel, which is a bit unusual. The base is wide and deep, which promises and delivers stability to the desktop. In the top view photo, you can see the 1500R curve which is a popular shape for the genre. It strikes a good balance between user immersion and image distortion, of which there is none. My only nitpick here is the stand height which is lower than I’m accustomed to. Even at maximum extension, the top of the screen sits just 19.1 inches above the desktop. Most monitors can get to 21 or 22 inches. Curved screens are best enjoyed perfectly vertical, so I would suggest raising the G34WQCP up with a small platform.

The input panel is up and under the center with clear labels printed in white. You get two HDMI 2.0 and two DisplayPort 1.4 ports along with a 3.5mm headphone jack. Internal speakers play with two watts of power and sound clean at modest volumes with sound focused on the upper midrange.

OSD Features

The G34WQCP’s OSD is controlled by a small joystick. Press it to open a quick menu, click up to summon the full OSD.

The G34WQCP’s OSD is all business with signal info at the top and six sections. Gaming is up first with all the necessary video processing features including overdrive. That comes in three fixed levels and a Smart OD option which varies the overshoot in concert with frame rates. In test patterns, I couldn’t find a perfect setting. There were always slight ghosting artifacts. Black indicates too little overshoot while white means too much. I noticed the latter less for actual content, so I went with Speed as the best choice. You can also opt for a backlight strobe, here called Aim Stabilizer. It reduces brightness by around 30% with no option for pulse width adjustment. It cuts motion blur significantly with just a slight phasing artifact. It’s one of the better implementations I’ve seen.

There are seven picture modes aimed at different uses. Standard is the default and best choice. It can be enjoyed without calibration, but a few minor changes make the picture better. To that end, there are five gamma presets and four color temps plus a user define slot with RGB sliders.

The overclock option is in the Display menu, which is turned off by default. That gives you 180 Hz while engaging it ups the value to 190. Despite the OSD’s warning about side effects, I didn’t experience any issues running the G34WQCP at 190 Hz all the time.

PIP and PBP are included in the feature list with options for PIP window size and location. You can also display two video sources side by side and swap their audio if you wish. There is no KVM here since USB ports are absent. In the System menu, you can program the joystick’s directions to different functions for quick access.

The GameAssist feature can be found in different forms on all Gigabyte gaming monitors. In the G34WQCP’s case, you get timers that count up or down, a frame rate counter and four aiming points.

Gigabyte G34WQCP Calibration Settings

Calibration of the G34WQCP is strictly optional. In the Standard picture mode, it hits the marks for color, grayscale, and gamma accuracy. I noted a very slight green tint in neutral test patterns, so I opted to adjust the RGB sliders. This made a visible improvement. To fix a highlight clipping issue, I reduced the contrast slider but kept the ratio above average. You’ll see my detailed results later. I’ve included recommended settings below. HDR content switches the monitor automatically where there are no picture controls available.

Gaming and Hands-on

Physically, the G34WQCP is familiar if you’ve used a Gigabyte monitor before. It has a nice and heft and feel that belies its low price. Monitors like this were $800 in the recent past. That you can get quality on this level for $350 is a testament for sure. I noted the lack of USB ports, which isn’t an issue since my mouse and keyboard stay attached to the same rig I use for every review. But users who like to switch out controllers will miss them. LED lights are absent as well but that’s an easy sacrifice to make when there are budgetary concerns. The stand is a bit unusual in that it sits lower than most. At full height, I had to angle the screen upward to center my viewpoint. A taller upright would be welcome. And the internal speakers, though clean and crisp, play only at polite volumes. I found myself reaching for headphones which can plug into the provided 3.5mm jack.

Once I got to gaming though, these things were quickly forgotten. The G34WQCP is lighting quick. You’ve heard of the Real Feel in weather forecasts. There’s a Real Feel when it comes to gaming monitors too. If motion is smooth enough, and responsiveness is free of perceptible delay, the numbers become less important. I’ve played on some truly spectacular gaming monitors with 240 Hz and higher refresh rates and almost no input lag. The G34WQCP feels every bit as good as one of them. I saw a few overdrive artifacts in test patterns, but in actual gameplay, they just didn’t surface to where I noticed them.

Whether whipping around maps in Doom Eternal or controlling Lara Croft’s gymnastics in Tomb Raider, the G34WQCP felt like an extension of the mouse and keyboard. It responded instantly to every command to where I didn’t have to think to move. Turning in place is amazingly quick, as is side stepping and jumping. I felt as though my reaction times shrunk within the first hour of gameplay.

The HDR image was surprisingly good. I say that because the G34WQCP has no local or field dimming to increase contrast. But it does have one of the highest contrast VA panels I’ve seen. Gigabyte specs it at 4,000:1 but my sample was right around 5,000:1 for SDR and HDR content. And HDR is very bright. The measured peak is around 435 nits, but it seemed brighter thanks to very deep black levels. Broad dynamic range also enhanced the G34WQCP’s color saturation which was excellent. It covers just over 90% of DCI-P3 but is so well balanced that it looks as colorful as anything I’ve tested short of a Quantum Dot display.

For productivity, the curvature brings the sides into a useful viewing cone without creating distortion. Spreadsheets can be viewed in large areas and it’s easy to put up two Word documents side by side for comparative editing, something I do a lot of.

Takeaway: I have no complaints about the G34WQCP’s usability as an everyday, do-it-all display. Curved monitors are great for gaming and their width works in productivity apps too. Above all, the G34WQCP is a superb gaming monitor. Its play feel and response are on par with the very best. And its image quality won’t be beaten by anything short of an OLED or premium Mini LED.

What is the relationship between these drawbacks and the rapid spread of AI?

This question was heavily addressed in ""South by Southwest"" (SXSW), with most AI-related sessions digging deeper into the topic of AI safety. Leaders from companies like IBM, Meta, Microsoft and Adobe shared insights into the future of AI. Leaders agree that the future of AI is not all pessimistic.

Hannah Elsakr, who launched the Adobe Firefly Enterprise Edition, said: ""AI needs a better public relations officer. We only know what we learn from science fiction. It is thought that AI will take over our lives, but that's not what AI aims.""

During each panel discussion, leaders from the leading AI technology companies discussed three comprehensive themes on the positioning of safety and responsibility in the future of AI. Listening to the leaders' comments may help ease your anxiety a little.

1. Applications are important

There is no denying that there is a defect in the AI ​​system. AI often causes halcination and biases in responses. Therefore, many people are concerned that introducing AI systems into the workplace will lead to errors in internal processes, which will negatively affect employees, clients and business goals.

The key to mitigate this problem is to carefully consider the tasks left to AI. For example, Sarah Bird, Chief Product Officer of Microsoft's ""Responsible AI"" division, is looking for applications that suit the current AI capabilities.

""We need to have the right tools for our job, so we don't necessarily need to use AI for every purpose,"" Bird said. ""In some cases, AI should never be used.""

An example of the use of AI that could cause problems is its use in human resource recruitment. Many studies have shown that AI has inherent biases that produce outputs that preferentially treat certain nationalities, academic backgrounds, and genders. As a result, IBM has stopped the selection and selection process using AI agents and now uses agents to match candidates and duties.

""Whatever the use of AI and agents is, it cannot be emphasized enough, the importance of knowing whether it suits your company and its culture,"" says Nickle LaMoreaux, Chief Human Resources Officer at IBM.

Just because AI can perform many tasks doesn't mean that it needs to be made by AI. Understanding the drawbacks and strengths of AI is important in avoiding pitfalls and deriving the best possible outcomes from AI implementation.",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,"""Developing international products from Japan"" -- CEO of Rakusai, AI technology group Helpfeel",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230735/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT","「日本発の国際的なプロダクトを作れる会社になる」。AI技術を組み込んだクラウドサービスの開発・販売を手掛けるHelpfeel 代表取締役 最高経営責任者（CEO）の洛西一周氏は、同社を立ち上げた目的をこう説明する。グローバルで通用する日本発のプロダクトが生まれない理由は「タイムマシン経営にある」とし、洛西氏は設立当初からクラウドサービスの開発とマーケティング体制の構築に力を注いだ。



Helpfeel 代表取締役 CEOの洛西一周氏 Helpfeel 代表取締役 CEOの洛西一周氏

洛西氏によると、タイムマシン経営とは米国で成功したプロダクトを日本風にアレンジして開発・販売すること。グループウェアなどがその典型だろう。しばらくの間は日本企業から受け入れられるが、先行する米国の巨大企業が日本市場に本格進出すれば、開発力も販売力もかなわない。多くのソフトウェア会社の売り上げ規模は500億円にも満たず、数十億円のソフトウェア会社がほとんどだ。対して洛西氏は、「当社は最初からグローバル展開を目指す」という。創業時、資金不足などを理由に受託開発からスタートし、余裕ができたら自社プロダクトの開発に取り組むパターンは少なくない。しかし、日本市場向けとなると日本語ワープロなどはその代表格で、海外で売れるのは難しいだろう。

実は、洛西氏には大学時代の苦い体験がある。同氏は高校生の時に、「Windows」のアプリケーション「紙copi」を開発し、ジャストシステムと共同販売をした。100万人に利用された実績をもつものの、徐々に売れなくなっていったという。米Microsoftが日本市場に進出し、ジャストシステムの牙城に乗り込んできたことなどが背景にあるとみる。開発・販売競争の激しさを目の当たりにした同氏は「Microsoftのやり方を学ぶために渡米しよう」と決意し、2007年に米国・シリコンバレーで起業する。シリコンバレーにはGoogleなどビジネスモデルの参考になるITベンダーが数多くあり、投資家やスタートアップ支援施設などのエコシステムも整っている。

シリコンバレーでは、現在テクニカルフェローの増井俊之氏が発明したオープンソースソフトウェア（OSS）のスクリーンショットソフト「Gyazo」を洛西氏と2人で事業化した。洛西氏によると、「画像などをアップロードし、共有できる世界初のクラウドサービス」で、利用者数は累計で約2200万になり、日本のユーザーはその約1割だという。しかし、マネタイズ化がうまくいかずに倒産寸前になり、5年間のシリコンバレー生活を終えて帰国した。

皮肉なことに帰国後、Gyazoの有料ユーザーが増え、売り上げ数億円の規模に成長した。同氏は「生き延びた」と語る。これを機に米法人の営業所を日本に設置し、活動を開始。この間にGyazoの販売を伸ばすとともに、新しいプロダクトの開発に着手した。2014年にはベンチャーキャピタル（VC）などから約2億円の資金調達にも成功する。

そうした中、「Helpfeel」の開発に取り組んだ。同サービスは、テクニカルフェローの増井氏が考えた新しいヘルプデスクツールだ。洛西氏は、「世の中にあるヘルプデスクは使いづらく、詳しい人に聞いたほうが早いこともしばしばあるだろう」とする。また、答えはマニュアルなどにあるが、人の質問とマニュアルに書かれていることが一致しないことに問題があるとも指摘する。そこで、素人や消費者の視点からヘルプデスクを作り直したという。消費者の言葉で質問や問い合わせをすると解決してくれる。回答が足りなければ蓄積していく。マニュアルを改良するのではなく、予測できるよう質問と回答を充実させる。それがHelpfeelだという。

2019年に提供を開始したHelpfeelは、これまで約500サイトに採用されている。2020年に営業所を法人格にするとともに、企業向けの営業部隊に約100人を配置し、国内企業に本格的に提案し、JR北九州やLIXILなど大企業にも次々に使われ始める。約30人のサポートチームが、受注した企業のデータを2～3カ月かけて読み込みながら、よくある質問（FAQ）などのウェブサイト構築や稼働を支援する。データの分析や使い方なども含めて伴走する形態にし、最近では北洋銀行、福岡銀行、足利銀行などの地方銀行や生命／損害保険会社、クレジットカード会社、消費者金融などの金融機関にも採用されたという。

次のクラウドサービスに開発にも乗り出す。洛西氏は「2025年をAIエージェント元年」と位置付け、多くの企業がAI活用の試用から業務変革の結果を出す段階に入ったと考えている。まずはFAQの検索、社内ナレッジの検索・活用するAIエージェントを開発し、早ければ6月ごろ、遅くても年内に提供を開始する。

意思決定を支援するAIエージェントは、例えばある企業にどんな提案をするのかというように営業を手助けする。“猫も杓子（しゃくし）も”AIエージェントを開発する中、「当社はAIの専門家集団で、自前で検索エンジンを開発し、ユーザーインターフェイスも作れる」と洛西氏は違いを主張する。洛西氏ら5人が情報処理推進機構（IPA）が実施する未踏事業に採択経験があるエンジニア（うち2人はスーパークリエーター認定）だという。

もちろん、Helpfeelのグローバル展開も開始する。まずはテストマーケティングから始めた。ターゲットにするカスタマサポートの管理職にメッセージを送り、オンライン商談に持ち込む。そのために、ウェブマーケティングと営業などの体制を整備もする。

洛西氏は売り上げを明かさないが、年平均成長率は70％だという。従業員は2024年に数十人を採用し、200人体制になった。2025年も約50人を採用する予定だ。同社のグローバル市場における実績、つまりグローバル展開へ向けた真価が2025年に問われることになる。",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,"Creativity is not replaced --At the Autodesk executives, the entertainment industry in the age of AI",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230382/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT","Autodesk, the US, uses 3D (3D) technology to develop software for a wide variety of applications, including design and design, engineering, and entertainment. We asked Diana Colella, Executive Vice President of Entertainment and Media Solutions (EVP), who visited Japan to build relationships with customers, about the company's strategy in the media entertainment (M&E) field, the role of AI, and its ability to contribute to the development of the same field in Japan.



Diana Colella, EVP of Entertainment and Media Solutions, Autodesk Diana Colella, EVP of Entertainment and Media Solutions, Autodesk

Autodesk provides products to game and animation production companies in the M&E field, and Japanese clients include Square Enix, which has worked on the Final Fantasy series, the White Group, which has produced Godzilla -1.0, and Cygames, which has worked on the Granblue Fantasy series, among others.

In addition to products that support the business itself, including the 3D animation/visual effect software ""Autodesk Maya,"" and the 3D modeling/animation software ""Autodesk 3ds Max,"" the company also develops products such as the cloud platform ""Autodesk Flow,"" which centrally manages workflows and data throughout the entire production.

Colella said, ""We have a strategy to provide a platform for three industries: Flow for M&E, Autodesk Forma for Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO), and Autodesk Fusion for Product Design and Manufacturing (D&M). Through our platform strategy, we can provide value not only for existing customers but also for new customers.""

One of Autodesk's strengths is that it can cross the boundaries of AECO, D&M, M&E and support customers in digital reform. Colella explains, ""It's technology that connects these three industries. For example, the real-time technology that forms the basis of the digital twin used by AECO, D&M has been used for a long time in the gaming industry. Virtual reality (VR) technology has also been used in M&E for many years, but this technology is also effective in AECO, D&M. Although the product names are offered different products, in the future, we will be pursuing the same technology in all industries.""

While the market size of the Japanese gaming/animation industry is on the rise, due to a shortage of creators, long working hours are becoming a challenge. In recent years, companies other than M&E, such as NVIDIA, have also been hiring CG creators, apparently, which has spurred a shortage of personnel.

In response, Colella declares, ""AI solves some of these challenges, but never replaces the role of creators."" AI is merely an assistant, and by acting on behalf of odd jobs and organizing the entire task, it allows creators to devote time to their original tasks. He then states his outlook, ""There is a shortage of creators, but there is a huge amount of content that needs to be created. If more people learn 3D technology, the workload for each individual will be reduced.""

Autodesk's platform also contributes to improving field work efficiency. By utilizing the platform, data can be shared across the board, from ""pre-production,"" which involves planning and composition content, to ""production,"" which involves filming, to ""post-production,"" which involves processing and finishing the recorded materials, making workflow more efficient.

""Until now, sharing data between pre-production and post-production has required many challenges, and by leveraging Autodesk Flow Capture, data collected through films can be delivered to post-production immediately, making it possible to streamline operations,"" explains Collela.

Regarding the part that Autodesk can contribute to the development of M&E in Japan, Colella said, ""We have great customers and have a track record. The background to this is the strong relationship of trust between us and our customers. In particular, our sales, marketing and customer support teams play a major role. What improvements are our customers looking for in Autodesk products, and what is necessary to make our content production pipeline more efficient? We want to continue to listen to our customers and provide solutions that meet their needs.""",zdnet

https://zdnet.com,Oracle has made the new expenses system of MS&AD and two non-life insurance companies common,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230866/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 13:02:00 GMT","MS&AD Insurance Group's Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance and Aioi Nissei Dowa Insurance have launched a new expense system that will be used by approximately 30,000 employees of both companies. Oracle Japan, which provides the system, announced it on March 24th. The system construction is handled by MS&AD Systems, the group's core system company.

With the introduction of the new expense system, the accounting departments of both companies have changed to business processes that are tailored to the standard functions of the system. This reduces maintenance costs compared to conventional in-house development systems. Furthermore, the digitalization of business processes and workflows has made it possible to respond to remote work.

The new system approves settlement applications and issues invoices for shared expenses based on the input data, and the generated journal entries are linked with the financial accounting system. It also enables management of the performance and progress of expenses related to project budgets. This has allowed us to deal with tax reforms, such as the revision of the Electronic Bookkeeping Act and the review of the 2024 entertainment expenses-free system without incurring additional costs.

The system is based on Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (Oracle ERP) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). In addition, ""Oracle Cloud Enterprise Performance Management"" (Oracle EPM) has been newly introduced to improve efficiency in budgeting and performance management of expenses. With the introduction of Oracle EPM, it has become easier to aggregate and visualize data generated within the expense system. Additionally, a subsystem was built with Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle APEX to facilitate transaction references from the general ledger.

MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings has a ""one-platform strategy"" that promotes commonalization, jointization and integration, focusing on the middle-back divisions of Mitsui Sumitomo Corporation, which are its subsidiary in its medium-term management plan, and Aioi Nissei Dowa Insurance. As part of this strategy, the expense system was standardized.",zdnet

同社はコンテンツ配信ネットワーク（CDN）というコンセプトを生み出したこの分野を代表する企業だが、「CDNビジネスは今後とも非常に重要なビジネスではあるが、Akamaiの売り上げの60％以上が今はサイバーセキュリティとクラウドコンピューティングになっている」と事業ポートフォリオの変化を踏まえた方針だとした。



アカマイ・テクノロジーズ 職務執行者社長の日隈寛和氏 アカマイ・テクノロジーズ 職務執行者社長の日隈寛和氏

実際に同氏が示した10年間の変遷では、2014年にはCDNが85％を占め、サイバーセキュリティが9％、クラウドコンピューティングが6％という構成だったが、2024年にはサイバーセキュリティが51％、CDNが33％、クラウドコンピューティングが16％だった。カテゴリー別の売上推移を見ると、サイバーセキュリティとクラウドコンピューティングが右肩上がりで成長しているのに対し、CDNは2020年以降年々減少しているという。

日隈氏はこの理由について「CDNビジネスのマーケットシェアは維持しているものの、価格競争が厳しくなっていることが背景にあり、売り上げは落ちている」と説明した。一方、2024年度の対前年比成長率は、サイバーセキュリティが16％成長、クラウドコンピューティングが25％成長となっている。

クラウドコンピューティング事業が本格的にスタートしてから約2年だが大きな成長を遂げており、今後の成長領域として注力していく方針だ。とはいえ、サイバーセキュリティ／クラウドコンピューティング共に、CDNのインフラがあってこその事業でもある。同氏は「Akamaiが持っているCDNの超分散型のアーキテクチャーの上に、サイバーセキュリティやクラウドコンピューティングのビジネスが成り立っており、CDNはわれわれにとって非常に重要なインフラだ。CDNがAkamaiの源／源泉であり、今後とも戦略的にしっかりと強化していく」と語った。

「まず、Akamaiの立場としては、前述の通り2030年までとしたNet-Zero Emissionsや100％renewable Energyに関する取り組み目標に変更はない。この方針は、取締役会や経営幹部の合意であり、会社全体で一貫している。大統領選のサイクルに従って政策が変わり、トランプ政権の発足によってわれわれのビジネスにも影響が生じるのは確かだ。しかし、われわれのサステナビリティーおよび環境への取り組みは政治情勢などの外部要因の影響とは無関係に一貫して継続される。株主、顧客、従業員など、関係者全てが環境に対する取り組みがAkamaiの事業にとって重要だと考えているためだ。確かに政治的な側面からの変化が社会や企業活動にインパクトを与えているが、だとしても前述のサステナビリティーに関する目標はAkamaiの事業目標と深く結びついており、変わることはない」

日隈氏は「Akamaiはグローバル企業であり、米国マサチューセッツ州ケンブリッジに本社を置いてはいるが、売り上げの半分以上は米国以外で生じている。それを考えると、やはり地球規模の課題に対してグローバル企業としてしっかりと取り組んでいかないといけないと考えている」と補足した。

米国政府の政策転換を受け、特に多様性推進のための施策に関しては民間企業の中にも政府に合わせて重視方針を取り下げることを表明した企業もあるが、サステナビリティー／環境問題に関してはそれほど目立った動きはないようだ。もちろん、こうした取り組みをコスト増として捉え、できればやりたくないと考えている企業や組織も存在するだろうが、こうした取り組みの意義を認めている企業では政権が代わって政策が転換しても特に影響はないようだ。政権交代に伴う混乱はしばらく続きそうだが、中長期的な視点に立って最善の道を選ぶ意識が大切だろう。",zdnet

副社長の宮本義敬氏は「ユーザー数3万2000人突破」「公開された活用事例が80件超」「活発なユーザー会活動」「国内市場シェア46％」といった状況を紹介し、特徴的な事例として良品計画とパナソニックインフォメーションシステムズでの利用状況を説明した。



New Relic 副社長 宮本義敬氏 New Relic 副社長 宮本義敬氏

良品計画は、「無印良品」ブランドのECサイトにNew Relicを導入。障害発生時に問い合わせを受け付けるコールセンターの非エンジニアの担当者がNew Relicの画面を見ながら状況を把握して一次回答が可能になったことで、バックエンドのエンジニアに問い合わせが振られる回数が減り、コールセンターでの顧客対応速度も向上したという。エンジニアの負担が減ったことでシステム改善に取り組む余裕が生まれた結果、問い合わせ回数が3カ月で約4分の3に削減できたという。

パナソニックグループの中核IT子会社であるパナソニックインフォメーションシステムズは、家電製品などを販売するECサイトの運営を担当しており、サイト内部の構成を可視化して改善するためにNew Relicを活用しているが、特徴的なのはIT担当ではない事業部側に対しても同じNew Relicの画面を使って進捗（しんちょく）報告などを行うことで、「同じ目線に立って問題解決に当たる」ことができるようになったという。

いずれの事例も、もともとはエンジニア向けのツールとして開発されたオブザーバビリティ製品を非エンジニアにとっても使いやすくしようとする取り組みの成果といえる。宮本氏は「New Relicはエンジニアのためのツールとして生まれ、必要なツールをどんどん作っていったのが始まり。それを統合してワンプラットフォーム化したのが5年前で、それによってさまざまな角度で分析できるようになり、非エンジニアの方／ビジネスサイドの方にも活用いただけるようになってきたのを“Observability 2.0”と位置付けている」と説明し、AIの活用によってさらなる進化を目指すという方向性を示した。



New Relic 執行役員 技術統括 兼 CTOの松本大樹氏 New Relic 執行役員 技術統括 兼 CTOの松本大樹氏

技術的なビジョンについて、執行役員 技術統括 兼 最高技術責任者（CTO）の松本大樹氏が説明した。同氏はオブザーバビリティの世界のトレンドとして「いまだ成長過程にあるマーケットである／成熟されていない」「エンジニアのためだけのツールではない」「AIシステムの管理とAIの活用の両輪」の3点を挙げた。

市場の成熟度について松本氏は「成熟されたソフトウェアの領域ではトップのベンダー5社でシェア50％、60～70％に達することも珍しくはないが、オブザーバビリティに関しては5社合計で大体35％。5社のプレーヤーは大体決まっているが、世の中に浸透する余地がある」と語った。このグローバルの状況と、宮本氏が紹介した国内シェア46％という数字を比較すると、New Relicがグローバル以上に日本国内で広く受け入れられていることが伺える。

次に、ユーザー層の広がりについて技術の視点から同氏は「もともとNew Relicの創業者のLew Cirne（ルー・サーニー）がAPM（アプリケーションパフォーマンス管理）というものを作ったのがオブザーバビリティの根源と言われている。これがすごく便利だということでアプリケーション以外のホストやブラウザー、モバイルといったあらゆるシステム領域に広げていったのが最初のフェーズだったが、ツールやデータが増えすぎてサイロ化したものを4年かけて一つのプラットフォームに統合したのがObservability 2.0となった。統合の結果、データを取り出したりデータを連携したりすることが容易になったため新機能のリリース速度が上がり、多くのインサイト（洞察）を得ることができるようになった」と解説した。

こうして、エンジニア以外の人にも活用が拡大した一方、新たな課題も生まれてきたという。「ここまでは『非常に良い変化／進化だ』となったのだが、情報量が多すぎて人間が理解することが難しくなってきたという弊害も見えてきている」とのことだ。同社は、新たな課題を踏まえて「“Observability 3.0”として、これまで以上に民主化をきちんと進め、皆さまがオブザーバリティのツールを使えるようにするために進化させる。具体的にはAIエンジンを強化し、システムの変化や障害を理解／予知することが簡単にできる仕組みづくりに取り組んでいく」というのがAIへの取り組み方針となる。

同社では既に「AI Assistance」としてLLMを活用したアシスタント機能で自然言語でのツールの操作を可能にする機能を2024年にリリースしているほか、APMモジュールでGPUなどのAI向けアクセラレーターを搭載したシステムの性能やリリース状況を監視できるようにもなっている。今後の取り組みとして「Agentic AIを活用できる領域を今後どんどん増やしていきたい」という。

AIエージェントが自律的に他のシステムと情報のやりとりを行うことを想定し、「Agentic Orchestration」としてエージェント連携が可能なパートナーの拡大に取り組んでおり、既にAmazon Web Services（AWS）、Microsoft、Google Gemini、SAPなどとのパートナーシップが発表済みだが、今回新たにServiceNowとの連携についても発表された。この連携によって「New RelicとServiceNowを採用する企業は、企業のワークフローを自動化し、ビジネスのアップタイムを最大化し、収益の損失を最小限に抑えることができる」という。

https://zdnet.com,"""System of Work"" maximizes the power of your team, a framework that supports your company's growth",https://japan.zdnet.com/extra/atlassian_202503_4/35230479/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","旧来の日本企業は、「全員が目の前の仕事を計画どおりに進めることで組織が成長する」という成功体験を積んできた。しかし、現代のビジネス環境は激しく変化するため、より柔軟に対応できる力を身に付ける必要がある。それには組織の目標を明確にして共有し、情報を伝達し合いながら、効率的に業務を遂行するための仕組みが欠かせない。

「AppleしかりMicrosoftしかり、常識を覆すような成功の背景には強固なチームが存在していました。しかし、特に現在のビジネス環境でイノベーションを生み出すには、適切な方法論によるチームワークの強化が欠かせないのです。System of Workとは、アトラシアンが23年の歴史で培ってきた経験・ノウハウを生かし、効果的なチームワークを実現するためのフレームワークです。組織全体でゴールを可視化し、共通の認識をもつこと、計画と進捗を細やかに管理してリアルタイムに共有すること、ナレッジを蓄積し、容易に活用できる仕組みを作ること――これらを統合的に実現する仕組みであり、企業の競争力を高めて繁栄していくための哲学とも言えます」と、アトラシアンでマーケティング統括マネージャーを務める朝岡絵里子氏は述べる。

そもそも日本企業の言う“チームワーク”とは、多くが上長から与えられた作業を分担するだけの「グループワーク」にとどまってしまっている。チームワークとは本来、メンバー全員が目指すべきゴールを正しく理解して、主体的に行動しながら、成果を最大化する働き方のことである。グループワークの考え方から抜け出せなければ、いかにコラボレーションツールや情報共有ツールを導入しても大きな効果は期待しにくい。そこで、アトラシアンが提唱する「System of Work」という考え方に注目したい。

しかし、業務効率化・属人性排除を目指したくとも、情報の分断が大きなハードルとなっている。特に現在はリモートワークの浸透によって働く場所が多様化し、クラウドサービスの流行によって適材適所で異なるツールを使うようになった。そのため情報共有がいっそう困難になり、チームの密な連携が難しくなっているのだ。

日本企業には業務をチームで進める“チームワーク”文化があるが、必ずしも効率的とは言えない。たとえば、プロジェクトの目的や成果の指標が十分に共有されないまま、上長から指示のあった作業を進めてしまうケースがある。その結果、業務の方向性を見失って手戻りや無駄な作業が発生する。また、個人の経験や暗黙知に依存しがちになるという属人化の問題を抱えている組織も少なくない。

System of Workのポイントはゴール、計画・進捗、ナレッジ

チームがチームとして稼働するには、ゴールを共有することが肝要である。System of Workではゴールの可視化と共有を重視しており、組織全体のゴールを明確に設定し、それを各チームや個人の目標へとブレイクダウンすることで、企業活動全体の方向性を統一するアプローチを推奨している。これにより、経営層が掲げる戦略目標と現場のタスクが一貫性を保ち、全員が同じ方向を向いて業務を進めることができる。

より具体的には、組織の最上位に位置する事業目標が、開発、営業、マーケティングなどの各部門に細分化され、さらに各個人の業務目標へと紐づける。さらにこの構造を可視化することで、自分の業務が企業全体の成果にどのように貢献しているのかが明確になる。

「自分が今取り組んでいる業務が、最終的に組織のゴールにどうつながっていくのか、一目で分かる環境が重要です」と、朝岡氏は述べる。目標がわからないタスクは、単なる作業にすぎない。ゴールがわかっていれば、優先順位を付けたり、修正・改良したりと、自律的に活動できるようになる。

アトラシアンが提供する統合プラットフォームでは、ゴールやその依存関係を可視化し、ツールのどこからでも確認できるようにしている。業務に応じてJiraやConfluenceを使い分けつつ、チーム全員が目標を意識しながら業務を遂行でき、状況の変化にも柔軟に対応しやすくなるというわけだ。単に目標を可視化するだけでなく、リアルタイムに追跡し、必要に応じて調整できるような仕組みを設けることが生産性の向上につながるのである。



チームワークの基礎となる原則 チームワークの基礎となる原則

ビジネスプロジェクトを成功に導くためには、異なるチームが密に連携しながら業務を進める必要がある。この連携には計画・進捗の管理が欠かせず、誰が・何を・いつまでに・どのように行うかという情報を整理し、統合的に把握できるようにすることが必要だ。当初の計画は完全なものではなく、ビジネス環境の変化やトラブルの影響を受けやすい。そのため最新の進捗情報をリアルタイムに共有し、変化の影響を把握できることが不可欠である。

「開発や営業、マーケティングが異なるシステムを利用していると、情報が分断され、迅速な判断が難しくなります。System of Workでは、部門ごとの目標やタスクを統合的に管理し、可視化することを理想としています。統一されたプラットフォーム上で進捗を管理することで、チーム間の連携がスムーズになるのです」（朝岡氏）

アトラシアンのJiraは、柔軟性の高いプロジェクト管理ツールであり、ソフトウェア開発だけでなく営業やマーケティングなど多様な業務に活用されている。Jiraの進捗管理機能は、各業務の特性に合わせたテンプレートが用意されており、ニーズに合わせてカスタマイズすることも可能だ。System of Workの実装として重要な点は、チームごとの作業プロセスを最適化しつつ、プロジェクトの全体像を俯瞰し、他のチームやメンバーがどの作業をどれほど進められているか、変化が自分のチームにどのような影響があるのかをリアルタイムに把握できることである。

このような仕組みがあれば、チームリーダーやマネージャーがプロジェクトの状況を正確に把握し、適切な判断を下すことができるようになる。さらに、業務遅滞の原因となりがちな状況確認や進捗会議が必要なくなるというメリットも大きい。

「アトラシアンが提供する計画と進捗を統合的に管理する機能は、組織全体の働き方を最適化するソリューションと考えています。チームのコラボレーションが強化され、企業の生産性向上につながる仕組みなのです」（朝岡氏）

チームのパフォーマンスを向上するには、個々の知識や経験を共有し、それらを必要とするメンバーが適切かつ迅速に生かせられるような仕組みが必要である。System of Workでは、「ナレッジの構築」「ナレッジの共有」「ナレッジの発見」という3つの視点で、組織内の知見を最大限に活用できる環境を整えることを必要とする。

組織内の知識や経験は、単なる文章だけでなく、動画や音声などリッチコンテンツで記録されているほうが望ましい場合もあるだろう。データベース化することで、さまざまに参照できる情報も多い。ホワイトボードに描いたブレインストーミングの内容やマインドマップが、重要なナレッジとなるケースもあるはずだ。これらを統合的に記録し、メンバーが自由に参照できる仕組みが望ましい。

リモートワークが浸透してワークフォースが分散されたことで、リアルタイムなコミュニケーションが難しくなっていることも課題の1つである。そこで、非同期コミュニケーションツールも組み合わせたい。ビデオレターのような仕組みがあれば、勤務時間の異なるグローバルチームであってもスムーズな情報連携が可能となる。

最後に、こうして蓄積されたナレッジをどうやって活用すればよいかという点が最大の課題だ。組織内にナレッジがあっても、すみやかに発見・活用できなければ意味がない。そこでポイントとなるのが生成AIである。ユーザーが必要な情報を適切に理解し、社内のナレッジを横断的に検索、必要なものをすばやく発見・整理するのに適した技術である。

すでにアトラシアンでは、これら3つの要素をエンタープライズWikiの『Confluence』、非同期コミュニケーションツールの『Loom』、企業内に眠れる知識を解放するAI『Rovo』といったソリューションを通じて提供しており、ナレッジ活用をいっそう強化することが可能だ。",zdnet

アトラシアン株式会社

ソリューション エンジニア・リード

皆川 宜宏氏 アトラシアン株式会社ソリューション エンジニア・リード皆川 宜宏氏 生成AIを効果的に活用するには、単にツールを導入するだけでは不十分だし、プロンプトを整えるだけでも十分とは言い切れない。AIが横断的に検索できるように各種業務ツールを相互に連携したり、社内のデータやナレッジを適切に管理してAIが活用しやすい形に整理したり、AIツールを業務プロセスに組み込んで日常的に使用できる環境を整えたりすることが欠かせない。こうした総合的なアプローチがなければ、AIの持つポテンシャルを最大限に引き出すことはできないのだ。 そうした理由から、アトラシアンのAIは非常に高い評価を受けているソリューションの1つとなっている。皆川氏は、同社のAI技術について、決して一朝一夕のものではないと強調する。

意識しなくてもシームレスに使えるAI機能 アトラシアンがクラウド版のJiraやConfluenceの投資・開発に着手したのは2014年ごろのことだ。同社は当時から、データの集積と活用に着目し、機械学習／AI技術の導入に注力していたという。クラウドサービスに複数のプロダクトとデータが集中するならば、これをいっそう有効活用する仕組みが求められる。従来型のデータベースでは難しいデータ量と複雑性に対応するための技術が必要だったのだ。そうして培ってきたノウハウと知見が、近年のLLM（大規模言語モデル）の発展と相まって、「Atlassian Intelligence」として結実した。 Atlassian Intelligenceは、アトラシアンの各製品に組み込まれたAI機能の総称である。例えば、プロジェクト管理ツールのJiraでは、長文の仕様書のポイントを整理したり、複雑なバグレポートを要約したり、自然言語で対話してインシデントの状況を把握したりといったことが可能だ。またコラボレーションツールであるConfluenceでは、AIがエンタープライズWikiの新規コンテンツの制作を支援したり、コンテンツを要約したりできるほか、情報を検索して外国語であれば翻訳すら自動で行ってくれる。ITSMツールの「Jira Service Management」でも、類似インシデントや関連ナレッジの検索という機能が搭載されており、人間以上に活躍するはずだ。いずれもツールに組み込まれており、簡単なクリック操作で利用できるため、AIであることを意識せずに活用できるのがポイントである。

Confluenceに組み込まれたAtlassian Intelligence Confluenceに組み込まれたAtlassian Intelligence 「セキュリティやコンプライアンスを懸念する声も当然ですが、私たちは長年にわたり、その重要性を理解して開発やサービス提供に取り組み、SOC 2やISO 27000など複数の認定を受けています。またユーザー自身が自社のポリシーに不安があったとしても、当社のアドバイザリーサービスチームが最適化のための支援を提供していますので、ぜひ活用していただきたいですね」（皆川氏）

AIエージェントの連携で高度なタスクも容易に自動化 さらにアトラシアンは2024年10月、最新のAI機能として、AI駆動型エンタープライズ検索ツール「Atlassian Rovo」を公開した。JiraやConfluenceだけでなく、クラウドストレージやチャット、開発ツールなどのクラウドアプリケーションと連携し、格納されている情報を横断的に検索することができる。カスタムコネクターを利用すれば、独自のデータソースを接続し、社内全体の情報を包括することも可能だ。チャットで尋ねればよいので、あいまいな情報であっても探しやすい。 JiraやConfluenceとの連携にも注目したい。Jira/Confluenceには、ノーコードで一連の処理を自動化できる機能が搭載されている。Rovoは、この自動化ルールに組み込んで自動的にアクションを実行させることができる。つまり、単純なトリガーや決められたアクションだけでは完遂できないような、高度なタスクすら自動化できるというわけだ。逆に、これまでプロンプトを入力していたタスクをJiraに組み込んで自動化できる、生成AIを業務プロセスの自動化に活用できるという点も特長的である。

Jira Service Managementに組み込まれたRovoエージェントの一例 Jira Service Managementに組み込まれたRovoエージェントの一例 ただし、Rovoの最大の特長であり、他の生成AI／AIアシスタントと大きく異なるところは、企業のチームワークを支えるために開発されているという点にある。 「アトラシアンは、バーチャルなチームメイトとしての姿をRovoに求めました。仕事で何かわからないことがあれば、同僚や先輩、専任部門の担当者などに聞きますよね。私たちが日常的にやり取りするような相手を、Rovoで実現したかったのです」と、皆川氏は語る。 例えばRovoは、エージェントをカスタマイズして“やさしい先輩”や“有能な専門家”などの人格・性格を与えることができる。単純に従業員が相談しやすい相手としてのキャラクター性だけでなく、どのような目標を持っているか、何が得意か、どんな話し方をするのかなど細かく手順や目標を持たせることで、作業やレスポンスの質を向上するねらいだ。もちろん従業員が愛着を持って利用できるため、定着率もよくなるという効果が得られる。 もちろん、単なるキャラクター性だけがRovoの真価ではない。Rovoには、アトラシアン独自の「チームワークグラフ」と呼ばれるAIモデルが組み込まれている。

ただのアシスタントではない、働き者のチームメイト この技術の背景には、アトラシアンが2024年に提唱した「System of Work」のコンセプトがある。組織内で効果的なチームワークを発揮するためのフレームワークで、「共通のゴール設定と可視化」「計画と進捗の統合的管理」「ナレッジの構築と活用」の3つを柱としている。組織全体が同じ方向を向いて、情報を共有しながら効率的に業務を遂行するための包括的な仕組みだ。 チームワークグラフは、System of Workの思想を具現化した技術の1つである。ユーザーやチーム、プロジェクト、タスクなどの関係性を理解したうえで、受け答えや作業を実行できる。 「人間のチームメイトであれば、単に聞かれたことに答えるだけでなく、関連した業務やプロジェクトの状況など、相手が知っておいたほうがよさそうな情報なども伝えますよね。真のチームメイトとして働くRovoの支援があれば、リモートワークが全盛の現代においても、チームワークをいっそう強化できるのです」（皆川氏） このほかにもRovoは、さまざまな業務を簡素化・強化する機能に富んでいる。例えばソフトウェア開発者であれば、GitHub Copilotを利用して効率よくコーディングしていることだろう。実は、CopilotのチャットからRovoを直接呼び出すことができるのだ。GitHubの画面を閉じたり切り替えたりせずに、Confluenceに保管されているコーディング規則を確認したり、プログラムに必要な設定情報をコピーしたりできるということである。またRovoはGoogle Chromeの拡張機能としても提供されているため、同じようにWebツールを利用しながら社内の情報へアクセスしたい場合に重宝する。皆川氏が気に入っている機能の1つで、開発やWeb業務に集中できるという点でお勧めだ。",zdnet

A video released by Boston Dynamics introduces the recent efforts of the bipedal robot ""Atlas."" This is probably one of the most impressive videos the company has released. Not only does it pick up and move objects, but it also shows off eerie human movements.

The human movements are impressive

The video begins with Atlas walking and then moves to driving. The way he walks is a bit awkward, but his running looks perfectly human. Furthermore, using the company's expression, they also show off the ""crawling"" movement, but it is more like the movements of a mountaineer. It's very smooth, but Atlas is still in development.

After showing off a passive judo movement, Atlas performed forward and breakdance, finishing off with a cartwheel. The cartwheel in particular looked very human.

Athletic intelligence

Boston Dynamics says Atlas learned new movements through reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error rather than following simple instructions and instructions) using human motion capture and animation. This is an evolution of the somewhat eerie movement that was shown about a year ago.

Atlas' core is the collaboration of perception and control to respond appropriately to the situation, which the company calls ""athletic intelligence."" It is said that a depth sensor is used to understand the surroundings in real time, visualize the environment, and operate accordingly. An advanced control system regulates the power and balance of the robot, moving the entire body as skillful and quick as a human.

https://zdnet.com,Part 5: Security in the next generation mainframe,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230165/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 06:00:00 GMT","Mainframes still play a key role in an organization's comprehensive strategy for security, reliability and performance reasons. A survey conducted by Kindrill in 2024 on senior IT decision makers and business leaders found that security is the most important feature of the mainframe and the biggest concern when moving from the mainframe. This time, we will introduce the latest mainframe technologies from a security perspective.

Defence and modernization of functionality

Even in mainframe environments, it is essential to implement a multi-layered defense strategy, rather than a single point of defense: comprehensive security measures such as data encryption, host firewall, access control, vulnerability management, patch management, and monitoring and detection. Not only does it improve the level of protection for servers and related devices, it is also necessary to meet overall security requirements based on a comprehensive security policy. Furthermore, even if multiple layers of measures are implemented, the risk of information leakage increases if security requirements and security features are not up to date or if they rely on older features.

Quantum computing to deal with threats

Quantum computers are becoming a reality as an alternative to existing supercomputers. For example, Google developed a new processor chip for quantum computers in December 2024. Quantum computers' powerful computing power makes it almost time-consuming operations that require astronomical time in traditional supercomputers can be completed in just a few minutes.

This suggests that quantum computers may have sufficient computing power to in the future destroy the cryptographic standards underlying the data and infrastructure of modern society. In other words, it is a serious threat to cybersecurity through the misuse of quantum technology. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) points out that advances in quantum computing could lead to the possibility that public key cryptography with a 2048-bit encryption key length will be broken by 2030.

To combat this threat, NIST announced a new encryption standard in August 2024. An example of a system that can use the NIST recommended quantum tolerance algorithms is the IBM z16. IBM z16 protects your data against future threats posed by quantum computer abuse. For example, the Crypto Express 8S (CEX8S) Hardware Security Module, installed in the IBM z16, offers both traditional and quantum-secured cryptography, allowing it to address future threats related to quantum computing, such as attacks that ""stolen data now and attempt to decipher it in the future.""

Companies and organizations need to formulate plans based on the assumption that they will move towards a ""quantum-safe state"" (where information is guaranteed to be secured through data encryption based on quantum mechanics), and implement quantum safety algorithms and protocols in stages. Additionally, data tiering and risk factors must be prioritized to prepare for a transition to quantum-safe state. Specifically, it includes data classification, encryption status checking, cryptographic analysis, cryptographic planning, cryptographic inventory creation, pre-migration steps, transitioning to quantum safe states, and post-migration actions and optimizations.

Quantum cryptography support is required to be completed before quantum computers are put into practical use, and to protect data from threats, with the cooperation of various industries. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether to support quantum cryptography in newly constructed systems or systems that are scheduled to be renewed. In preparation for the future development of encryption technology, there is a high possibility that data re-encryption operations will be required when system renewals, so it is desirable to consider improving operations, such as automating the re-encryption procedure.",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,Is the Apple Watch evolved with a camera installed? Possibility of realising within two years,https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230846/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 10:26:00 GMT","Apple is said to be installing a camera on its Apple Watch within the next two years and is trying to support artificial intelligence (AI) features such as visual intelligence. This was reported by Mark Gurman of Bloomberg.

According to Gurman, Apple is considering adding cameras to standard Series and high-end Ultra models by 2027. This coincides with the trend of smartphone manufacturers such as Apple, Google, and Samsung being focused on AI capabilities on the latest devices.

""The current idea is to incorporate the camera into the Series version of the display, just like the front camera on an iPhone,"" Gurman said in his weekly newsletter. The Ultra cameras are slightly different in place and are said to be mounted on the sides near the crown and buttons.

Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The company released the AI ​​function group ""Apple Intelligence"" in ""iOS 18.1"" in October 2024, and as part of this, it provides a visual intelligence function that identifies surrounding objects and locations and displays related information.

Gurman reported in December 2024 that Apple was exploring the possibility of adding biometric features such as temperature sensors to its AirPods. He and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also reported that Apple plans to install an infrared camera in its AirPods by 2026.

そのベトナムで存在感を高めているのが、日本の東急グループだ。ベトナムの高い成長ポテンシャルに注目した同社は、日本国内での100年を超えるノウハウを活用し、ビンズン省で本格的なまちづくりプロジェクトを推進。現地企業とのジョイントベンチャー「ベカメックス東急有限会社」を通じて、ビンズン新都市を構成する住宅や商業施設、交通インフラといった「街づくり」を包括したパッケージとして輸出するという、総合的な都市づくりに取り組む。

高成長続けるベトナムで開発進むビンズン省

東急グループは、国内では「東急電鉄」などを中心とした移動インフラや、関連地域での不動産、街づくりといった事業を展開する。

ベガメックス東急 設計部 部長を務める釣佳彦氏は、海外でプロジェクトを進める背景として「東急沿線は経済が停滞する日本の中では比較的恵まれており、2035年に総人口のピークを迎える。しかし、老齢化や働き手の減少などは予想されている。一方で世界では、アジアやアフリカで順調な人口増が見込まれている」と話す。東急が成長を続けるため、必要な経済活性が見込めるエリアへのシフトチェンジの必要性を強調する。

東急グループは、シフトチェンジ先のエリアとしてベトナムに注力。東南アジアの中で人口が3番目に多いこと、GDP成長率も安定的に推移していること、今後の成長の継続が見込めることなどが理由にあるという。

「ベトナムの直近のGDPは、住宅販売市場が急拡大した日本の1970～1980年代と非常に酷似している。豊富な働き手がおり、都市部への流入者の年齢も非常に若い」（釣氏）。輸出加工型のみだけでなく、内需型ビジネスとしても魅力的な市場と話す。

開発を進める地域は、神奈川県ほどの大きさの約2700平方kmに約276万人が暮らす、ホーチミン市に近いビンズン省だ。多くの工業団地を抱えるため直近まで安定的な人口増が続いており、ベトナム内での月間平均所得は1位となっている。

また、ホーチミンの中心地からビンズン省は車で約1～2時間だが、直線距離では約30km。交通インフラが整えばベッドタウンとしても期待できる、これからの伸びしろもある街だという。実際にホーチミンからビンズン新都市まで、日本政府の支援でMRT（Mass Rapid Transit：大量高速輸送）およびBRT（Bus Rapid Transit：バス高速輸送）を整備する計画もあるとのことだ。

釣氏は「2024年の12月22日、ホーチミンにMRT1号線がようやく開通した。ビンズン新都市の中心に（交通インフラが）延伸する予定もある」とし、ビンズン省のさらなる価値向上への期待を口にした。

ビンズン省で進む東急流「街づくり」--日本企業と連携して差別化図る

東急グループは2012年、ベトナムの国営企業となるベカメックスIDCと、合弁会社となるベカメックス東急を設立。資本金8兆6000億ベトナムドン（約525億円）、従業員数約400人、東急が65％の出資比率を持つ企業だ。

ベカメックス東急は、総面積約1000haのビンズン新都市のうち街区面積110ha（敷地面積約71ha）を「東急ガーデンシティ（TOKYU GARDEN CITY）」の「Hikari Area」「SORA gardens Area」「MIDORI PARK Area」として開発。約10～15年後の完成を目指して2割ほどを開発しており、街の認知度向上と定住に向けた街づくりを進めているという。

釣氏は、ビンズン新都市における東急の街づくりの特徴として、日本の街づくりを総合的なパッケージとして輸出していることを挙げる。具体的には、マンションなどを1つずつ建築してエリアを開拓していく従来型の街づくりではなく、住宅に加えてサービスなどの周辺環境も付随させる、街そのものとしての開発になるという。

「人口が増えて街が大きくなればなるほど、抱える課題も増える。交通渋滞や都市機能の欠如、脆弱なインフラ…膨らみ続ける課題に対し、日本で街作りのノウハウを培った東急グループならではの対策として差別化できる」（釣氏）

ただし、それらさまざまな課題は日本の街においても、1社単独で解決しているわけではない。東急ガーデンシティにおいても、「すき家」「AEON」といった飲食小売店をはじめとする多分野の日系企業が参画。さまざまな課題を解決できる魅力ある日本の街を再現・発信すべく、日々連携して取り組んでいるという。

連携の一例として、2023年から2024年にかけて、無印良品やパナソニックと共同で「JAPAN HOME」も実施した。憧れて住める日本品質の住環境を提案するイベントになったという。

「東急グループ100年強のノウハウを生かし、日本の街づくりを輸出している。さまざまなパートナーとともに日本の魅力を発信し、地域に根付き、愛される街づくりを推進していく」（釣氏）

詐欺師を邪魔するAIおばあちゃん「Daisy」



提供：Zooey Liao / CNET 提供：Zooey Liao / CNET

Kitbogaが高齢者を守るために詐欺対策活動を始めたように、英国の通信会社O2は詐欺師をこらしめるために理想的な「標的」を作り出した。

その名はDaisy（正式なつづりは「dAIsy」）。白髪にメガネ、そして「Fluffy」という名前の猫を飼っている、典型的な老婦人の姿をしたAIチャットボットだ。声は、従業員の祖母から拝借した。Daisyは家族のエピソードや独特のクセを学習しており、ことあるごとにレモンメレンゲパイのレシピを披露するようにプログラミングされている。

O2は、Daisyの個人情報を意図的にインターネット上に「流出」させた。詐欺師たちはこの情報にとびつき、フィッシング攻撃をしかけた。フィッシングは、無防備な被害者から個人情報を盗み出すサイバー攻撃の一種だ。Daisyの仕事は、詐欺師から電話がかかってくるのを待つことだった。

「Daisyは眠らず、食事もとらないため、すぐに電話に出ることができた」とO2の担当者は振り返る。

Daisyは一度に1件の電話にしか対応できないが、数カ月の間に話をした詐欺師は1000人近くに上った。Daisyは詐欺師がでっちあげたストーリーに耳を傾け、偽の情報を提供したり、できるだけ会話を引き延ばしたりした。O2は、Daisyと詐欺師の会話を分析し、何がうまくいき、何がうまくいかなかったかをもとにAIをさらに訓練していった。

「詐欺師が『ハッカー』と言ったら、『スナッカー（おやつを食べる人）』と解釈するようにAIを訓練した。その結果、ハッカーという言葉を聞くたびに、Daisyはお気に入りのビスケットについて延々と話をするようになった」という。Daisyの長話に詐欺師たちはいらだち、こっけいなほど感情をあらわにするようになった。

「DaisyがAIだと分かっていれば笑い話だ。しかし、実際の詐欺では無防備な高齢者が標的になることが多い。会話が進むにつれて、詐欺師たちはひどい言葉をDaisyに投げつけるようになった」と同社は言う。

O2は詐欺師の手口を多くの人に知ってもらうために、詐欺師を翻弄するスキャムベイティング動画で知られる英国の人気YouTuber、Jim Browning氏の協力を得て、Daisyを開発した。O2の広報担当者によると、Daisyキャンペーンの大きな狙いは、詐欺電話や詐欺メッセージを通報できる英国のホットライン「7726」の認知度を高めることだったという。

Daisyは詐欺師の時間を奪うことに成功したが、O2も認めている通り、それだけでは詐欺やなりすましを減らすことはできない。多くの場合、詐欺の拠点は巨大なコールセンターであり、無数の従業員が昼夜を問わずに詐欺電話をかけているからだ。そのすべてをDaisyのような複雑なボットで食い止めようとすれば、必要なリソースははかりしれない。

Daisyはもう詐欺師をだます活動はしていないが、AIを活用した詐欺対策のプロトタイプとして大きな役割を果たした。O2は今も、この技術の未来に大きな期待を寄せている。しかし、「取り組みの規模を拡大するためには、何万人分もの人格を作らなければならない」とO2は言う。

では、もし何千もの詐欺電話をブロックできるだけのAIボットを用意できたらどうだろう。まさに、これを実現しようとしているのが次に紹介するオーストラリアのハイテク企業だ。

詐欺師をあざむくAI女神「Apate」

ある晴れた午後、Dali Kaafar氏はオーストラリアのシドニーで家族との外出を楽しんでいた。その時、スマートフォンが鳴った。知らない番号だ。普段なら無視するが、今回は遊び心から詐欺師の相手をしてみることにした。

マッコーリー大学の教授で、同大サイバーセキュリティハブのエグゼクティブディレクターを務めるKaafar氏は、何も知らないふりをして詐欺師と44分間も話し続けた。詐欺師の時間を浪費させることには成功したが、自分の時間も無駄になった。もしテクノロジーに詐欺師の相手をさせることができれば、自分の時間を犠牲にすることなく、もっと多くの詐欺師から時間を奪えるはずだ。

この出来事をきっかけに、Kaafar氏はApateを立ち上げた。Apateはテクノロジーを使って詐欺を自動的に検知し、妨害するAIプラットフォームだ。Apateはオーストラリアを中心に、世界の数カ所でボットを運用し、「WhatsApp」などのメッセージングアプリを含む、複数のチャネルで詐欺師を翻弄している。

ある音声クリップでは、Apateのボットが詐欺師の時間を無駄にしている様子を確認できる。AIは世界中のアクセントを模倣できるため、声だけで本物の人間と区別することはほぼ不可能だ。

試しに聞き比べてほしい。どちらがボットか分かるだろうか。

Apateは銀行や通信会社と協力して、詐欺の手口や情報を収集し、各社が詐欺対策を強化できるよう支援している。例えば、オーストラリア最大の銀行CommBankとのパートナーシップでは、同行が詐欺情報を分析し、顧客を保護できるよう支援した。

Kaafar氏によれば、初期のボットは性別、年齢、性格、感情、言語の異なる約120種類のAI人格で構成されていたという。しかし、すぐに規模を拡大する必要があることに気づいた。現在は3万6720のAIボットが稼働しており、その数は増え続けているという。同社はオーストラリアの通信会社と組み、毎日2万から2万9000件の詐欺電話をブロックしている。

しかし、電話を阻止するだけでは十分ではない。コールセンターの詐欺師たちはオートダイヤルを使っているため、1つの番号が塞がれても、すぐに別の番号に発信できる。詐欺対策の網の目をかいくぐり、数の力にものを言わせてターゲットを見つけ出す。

O2は、さまざまなミッションと目的を持ち、本物の人間のように会話ができるAIボットに詐欺師の相手をさせることで、実在の人々がこうむる被害を軽減しているだけだけでなく、詐欺師のデータを盗み、素性を暴くためのワナをしかけている。例えば銀行や金融機関と協力し、詐欺師に特別なクレジットカード情報や口座番号を教える。詐欺師がこのクレジットカードを使ったり、口座にアクセスしたりすると、金融機関はアクセス情報を遡って犯人を特定できる。

Apateの善玉ボットが、詐欺師の悪玉ボットと対決することもあるという。まさに「理想の世界」だとKaafar氏は言う。「Apateのボットが盾となって、人々を詐欺ボットから守っている」

AIにはAIで対抗

AIを犯罪に悪用する話はよく聞くが、金融犯罪と戦う「AIヒーロー」は新鮮だ。しかし、詐欺師の側も着実に勢いを増しつつある。

2025年1月だけで、米国では1日平均1億5300万件ものロボコール（自動音声電話）が発信された。そのうちの何件がAIを悪用して人々から金銭や個人情報を盗み出そうとするものだったのだろう。詐欺の専門家で、ブログ「Frank on Fraud」を運営するFrank McKenna氏によると、2025年末にはほとんどの詐欺がAIやディープフェイクを取り入れるようになるという。

電話を利用した詐欺は、今や巨大な家内工業と化し、数十億ドル規模の経済損失を生み出しているとDaniel Kang氏は言う。Kang氏とイリノイ大学アーバナシャンペーン校の研究者たちは複数のAIエージェントを詐欺師として訓練することで、どれだけ簡単に人々から金銭や個人情報を盗み出せるかを検証した。

2024年の調査では、音声機能を搭載したAIエージェントは、人々から銀行の認証情報を盗み、アカウントに不正ログインし、送金するといったありふれた詐欺であれば自律的に実行できることが証明された。

「AIはあらゆる面で急速に進化している」とKang氏は言う。「政策立案者、国民、企業はまず、この事実を肝に銘じなければならない。そうすれば対策を講じられるようになる」

少なくとも一握りの個人や組織は詐欺に対抗するための啓発活動に取り組んでいる。こうした活動は、詐欺を仕掛けられた時に気づけるという意味では有用だ。しかし、完璧な解決策にはならない。この種の対応では追いつけないほど詐欺行為が増えているからだ。

「チャットボットで行き当たりばったりに詐欺師の時間を無駄にするだけでは足りない。この方法で効果を上げるには詐欺の規模が大きすぎる。チャットボットは優秀なツールだが、それだけには頼れない」とMcKenna氏は言う。

こうした取り組みと並行して、大手のテクノロジー企業や銀行、通信会社も消費者の安全の確保に力を入れるべきだとMcKenna氏は主張する。例えば、Appleは自社のデバイスにAIを組み込むことで、ディープフェイクの検出機能を簡単に実装できるだろう。しかし、多くの企業は法律やコンプライアンス上の問題に巻き込まれることを恐れて、AIの活用に及び腰だ。

「まるでブラックボックスだ」とMcKenna氏は言う。こうした複雑さが詐欺師に有利な環境を生み出し、銀行や金融機関は後手に回っている。

一方、AI技術の進化を利用して高度なサイバーセキュリティを実現し、詐欺の撲滅に取り組んでいる企業も存在する。例えばSardineは、偽の個人情報や他人の個人情報を使った口座開設を検出できるソフトウェアを銀行や小売業者向けに提供している。このアプリはディープフェイクをリアルタイムで検出し、デバイスがボットである可能性が高いと判断すると銀行にアラートを送り、取引をブロックする。

受賞歴のあるサイバー詐欺専門家で、ポッドキャスト「Fraudology」を運営するKarisse Hendrick氏によれば、銀行は顧客の金融データや取引パターンなどの情報をAIと組み合わせることで、ハッキングや窃盗を未然に防げるという。例えば、行動的生体認証を用いて消費者の取引パターンを分析し、外れ値を検知することで、詐欺の疑いがある取引にフラグを立てられる。

詐欺師がAIを活用して悪事を働いているなら、唯一の対抗策は、こちらもAIを使うことだ。「火には火で対抗しなければならない」とHendrick氏は言う。

https://zdnet.com,Ballista: IoT botnet compromises thousands of TP-link routers,https://www.zdnet.de/88421180/ballista-iot-botnetz-kompromittiert-tausende-tp-link-router/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 18:32:28 GMT","Security experts from the Threat Research team from Cato Networks (Cato CTRL) have exposed a new IoT botnet called Ballista. It uses a security gap (CVE 2023-1389) to automatically spread over the Internet. Archer routers of the provider TP-Link are affected, especially the AX21 model, which is also known as AX1800.

The security gap is created by insufficient validation of user inputs in the router web interface. This enables attackers to carry out commands with root rights. After the infection, the malware sets up an encrypted command and control (C2) channel to port 82, through which it can fully control compromised devices.

In addition to executing Shell commands, the functional scope of the malware includes denial-of service attacks and access to confidential data in the system. It spreads further by attacking other TP-Link Archer routers over the same security gap. According to Cato Networks, a special feature is its modular architecture, which supports different functions, including an Exploiter module for the distribution and a flooder module for DDOS attacks.

""In the sights of the Ballista botnet, organizations from the areas of manufacturing, healthcare, services and technology include in countries such as the USA, Australia, China and Mexico,"" said Cato Networks. ""With the help of a Censys search, over 6,000 potentially endangered devices were identified."" The security provider assumes that the campaign can be assigned to an Italian threat player. This assessment is based on the IP address of the C2 server and Italian strings in the malware. The botnet should also show similarities with other known bot nets such as Mirai, but act independently.",zdnet

This is the result of an examination of Cloudflare. The company justifies the number with the reuse of passwords for several accounts - and the further use of registration data even after data loss.

The evaluation is based on data from websites that use the Cloudflare network including the protective function for leaked passwords. In addition, only successful registration processes flowed into the analysis in which a participation of bots can be excluded.

If registration processes that were probably initiated by bots are included, the proportion of compromised passwords increases significantly. According to CloudFlare, around 52 percent of all inquiries that were leaked by Cloudflare database with more than 15 billion entries contained through the end of September and mid -November 2024 in mid -November 2024. This also includes the passwords collected by Have i Been Pwned.

""This percentage corresponds to hundreds of daily authentication requests that come from both bots and people,"" said Cloudflare. ""Even if not every attempt is successful, the sheer quantity of the leaked registration data in real data traffic shows how often the reuse of passwords is. Many of these leaked registration data still grant valid access, which increases the risk of account takeover.""

Targeted attacks with compromised passwords, so-called credential stuffing, are 95 percent of bots, according to Cloudflare. They often directed content management systems such as WordPress, Joomla and Drupal, since these are not only widespread, but are also known for exploiting vulnerabilities. In the case of WordPress, Cloudflare determined that 76 percent of the registration attempts with leaked passwords were successful on websites created with WordPress.",zdnet
