Finland, Denmark, and Germany have issued warnings to transgender and nonbinary individuals traveling to the US, after President Donald Trump enacted a policy recognizing only two sexes.   

Since taking office, Trump has issued multiple orders affirming this new approach and has directed the US Health Department to clarify sex-based definitions. The new guidance defines sex as an immutable biological trait and states that individuals should be classified strictly as male or female.   

An update on the Danish Foreign Ministry's US travel page posted on Thursday advises trans individuals to contact the US embassy in Copenhagen before traveling.  

“If your passport has the gender designation X or you have changed gender, it is recommended to contact the US embassy prior to travel for guidance on how to proceed,” the Danish Foreign Ministry's page reads.  

The change on Denmark's travel page came about a week after Finland issued a similar update. While it doesn't explicitly reference Trump's executive order, the advisory notes “there are two gender designations to choose from: male or female” when applying for a visa or Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) approval.   

The German Federal Foreign Office, in its updated travel guidance, also warned that US visa and ESTA applications require selecting either “male” or “female.” Berlin also advised whose gender is marked X or whose gender differs from their sex assigned at birth to consult the American authorities about entry requirements before traveling. 

The advisory comes as the US State Department has suspended a policy allowing trans, nonbinary, and intersex Americans to update the sex designations on their passports. US passport holders were previously able to self-select their sex, with one option being the letter X denoting that a person's gender is unspecified.  

For years, the US had moved away from traditional gender identity standards, including replacing ‘mother' and ‘father' with ‘parent one' and ‘parent two,' and established protections for transgender rights and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs under former US President Joe Biden's administration. Last year, the Vermont Department of Health even recommended using gender-neutral terms such as ‘child' or ‘kid' instead of ‘son' or ‘daughter' to promote inclusive language.   

Since assuming office Trump has rolled back trans rights protections and ended federal support for medical operations related to sex change procedures for minors to protect them from “chemical and surgical mutilations.”   

In a series of executive orders, Trump also barred “radical gender ideology” in the military and banned trans women from female sports. There are also plans to block transgender athletes from competing in US-hosted events, including the 2028 Olympics and World Cup.

UK military officials have dismissed Prime Minister Keir Starmer's proposal for deploying Western troops to Ukraine as part of a ‘peacekeeping force' to oversee a potential ceasefire, The Telegraph reported on Sunday. Senior military sources told the outlet that Starmer had “got ahead of himself.”

Starmer announced the initiative earlier this month, aiming to build a “coalition of the willing” to support Ukraine militarily. Last week, he claimed that multiple countries backed the idea of sending in a peacekeeping force of up to 10,000 troops, despite Moscow's opposition to any Western deployments in the conflict zone.

London hosted planning talks last week with military officials from partner nations. However, military sources dismissed the plans as premature and politically motivated.

“There is no defined military end-state or military-strategic planning assumptions. It's all political theater,” one senior army official told the news outlet.

“Starmer got ahead of himself with talk of boots on the ground before he knew what he was talking about.”

The discussions have reportedly shifted their focus from boots on the ground to air and naval support. The Telegraph reported that RAF fighter jets could be deployed to patrol Ukrainian airspace, while British Typhoons could provide air cover for ground forces, though the size and role of any ground deployment remain unclear.

“It's politics. There's no military sense in it,” another defense source said, noting that neither Russia nor the US support the coalition. He also pointed to a lack of clarity on mission goals.

“What is a 10,000-international force based in the west of the country over 400km from the front line meant to do? It cannot even protect itself,” he argued. “What is the mission? What is its legitimacy? What are the rules of engagement? How is it commanded, supplied and housed? How long is it there for and why? No one knows.”

Further planning talks are expected in London on Monday between British and French defense officials. French President Emmanuel Macron is reportedly considering invoking the UN to authorize a European troop presence in Ukraine. However, Russia has repeatedly rejected the idea of Western peacekeepers in Ukraine, noting that it would require UN Security Council approval, where Moscow holds veto power.

Senior Russian and US officials have started talks on a settlement of the Ukraine conflict in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, several media outlets have reported. The negotiations are expected to focus on maritime security in the Black Sea and a potential ceasefire.

The Russian delegation includes Grigory Karasin, the chair of the Federation Council's Foreign Affairs Committee, and Sergey Beseda, an adviser to the director of the Federal Security Service. According to Reuters, the US side is led by Andrew Peek, a senior director at the White House National Security Council, and Michael Anton, a senior State Department official.

TASS reported that the closed-door talks kicked off on Monday morning in the Ritz-Carlton hotel, adding that the Saudi security services had asked reporters to vacate the premises. Ruptly video agency also published a short clip of a group of Russian and Saudi officials walking inside the hotel.

Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East and a key figure in the settlement process, suggested that the talks would lead to “some real progress, particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries. And from that you'll naturally gravitate to a full-on shooting ceasefire.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov cautioned that the talks are likely to be difficult, pointing to a host of issues surrounding the resumption of the 2022 Black Sea grain deal, which allowed Ukraine to safely export agricultural products via the Black Sea. Russia pulled out of the deal in 2023, citing the West's failure to ease sanctions hindering its agricultural exports.

The talks also follow US-Ukraine negotiations in Saudi Arabia. According to Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, the delegations discussed “proposals to protect energy facilities and critical infrastructure.”

The prime minister of Greenland has hit out at the US following the announcement that Second Lady Usha Vance and senior American officials will visit the island on Thursday. The administration of US President Donald Trump is pursuing control over the autonomous Danish territory and its resources.

Mute B. Egede described the upcoming trip – reportedly involving National Security Adviser Michael Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright – as part of “very aggressive American pressure” aimed at “taking over our country over our heads.”

In an interview with local newspaper Sermitsiaq on Sunday, Egede criticized Western nations for inadequately opposing the US, stating, “Our allies in the international community feel like hiding in a small corner and almost whisper their support, which has no effect.”

Jens-Frederik Nielsen, leader of the Demokraatit party, which recently won parliamentary elections, described the scheduling of the visit during coalition talks a gesture of disrespect.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said her government viewed the trip within the context of the Trump administration's territorial claims on Greenland, adding that Copenhagen's cooperation with the US is conditional to “the fundamental rules of sovereignty.”

Vice President J.D. Vance's wife will travel to Greenland with her son and a delegation of officials to explore historic sites and observe a dog race, as stated in her office's announcement on Sunday. Participants “are excited to witness this monumental race and celebrate Greenlandic culture and unity,” it added.

Members of the Trump administration will conduct their own itinerary featuring a visit to the Pentagon's Pituffik Space Base. Trump's interest in Greenland stems from the island's strategic position near the Arctic and its potential natural resources.

The US administration has questioned the sovereignty of Canada, Denmark, and Panama, asserting that American national interests necessitate controlling their territories. Specifically regarding Greenland, the vice president claimed in February that Copenhagen is “not doing its job” and “is not being a good ally” to Washington.

If American interests require taking “more territorial interest in Greenland, that is what President Trump is going to do, because he doesn't care about what the Europeans scream at us,” he stated.

A senior Hamas political leader was among five people killed in an Israeli airstrike on a hospital in Gaza on Sunday, the Palestinian militant group has said. Medical staff were also reportedly among the victims.  

Israel has launched a renewed offensive in Gaza after a ceasefire between Hamas and the Jewish state expired on March 1. The two sides have been unable to agree on how to extend the truce, which was initially brokered by the US and Arab states.

According to the Gaza Health Ministry, Sunday's strike hit the surgery department at the Nesser Medical Complex in Khan Younis. Doctors working at the facility told CNN that the airstrike took place at night and left part of the hospital in flames.

The Israeli military said it carried out a strike on a “key terrorist in the Hamas terrorist organization who was operating inside [the hospital].” It claimed that extensive intelligence had been conducted before the attack, and that it involved precision munitions to minimize harm.

Hamas has since stated that a member of its political office, Ismail Barhoum, as well as his nephew, Ibrahim, were killed in the attack. The Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV has reported that Bahroum had been receiving medical treatment at the Nasser Medical Complex for injuries sustained in a separate Israeli airstrike last week.

The Palestinian militant group has described Barhoum's death as evidence of Israel's “disregard for international norms and agreements,” given that hospitals are entitled to special protection during armed conflict under the Geneva conventions.

The Israeli military announced the resumption of both air and ground operations in the enclave last week after accusing the Palestinian group of refusing to release hostages and rejecting revised terms on extending the ceasefire.

“Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has said.

Hamas has accused Israel of “unilaterally” ending the ceasefire, according to Reuters. 

Palestinian authorities said on Sunday that more than 50,000 people have been killed in Gaza after nearly 18 months of fighting in the enclave.

The war between Israel and Hamas broke out after Palestinian militants carried out a surprise attack on Israeli cities on October 7, 2023, leaving around 1,200 people dead and taking around 250 hostages.

Germany has temporarily closed its embassy in South Sudan's capital, Juba, saying Africa's newest country is on the verge of civil war amid reports of heightened tensions between President Salva Kiir Mayardit and his first deputy, Riek Machar.

The German Foreign Office announced the move on Saturday, two weeks after the US ordered its non-emergency government personnel in South Sudan to leave the country, citing security concerns.

“After years of fragile peace, South Sudan is once again on the brink of civil war. President Kiir and Vice President Machar are plunging the country into a spiral of violence,” the ministry wrote on X.

“Germany has decided to temporarily close operations of our embassy in Juba due to the current situation. The safety of our colleagues is top priority,” it added.

The East African country gained independence from Sudan in 2011 but has remained volatile since the end of a five-year civil war that erupted in 2013 over a feud between President Kiir and his current first vice president, Machar. Despite a 2018 peace deal allowing the rivals to share power, political tensions persist due to Kiir's frequent dismissals of officials reportedly loyal to Machar.

Last week, Kiir sacked the governor of Upper Nile state, where clashes have erupted between South Sudan People's Defense Forces (SSPDF) and the White Army militia, which is mostly made up of Nuer people, Machar's ethnic group. Two ministers and several senior military officials allied with Machar have also been arrested. Earlier this month, several soldiers of the SSPDF, including an army general, were killed when a UN helicopter came under attack while attempting to evacuate them from the troubled Upper Nile state.

The Sudanese government and army accuse Machar and his party of escalating the conflict. The vice president has denied the allegations and reportedly accused Kiir of attempting to depose his supporters.

Last Tuesday, the United Nations peacekeeping chief in South Sudan, Nicholas Haysom, warned the Security Council that the landlocked state “is poised on the brink of relapse into civil war” and requires “immediate and collective intervention.” He said the crisis “threatens to erase the hard-won peace gains since the signing of the Revitalized Agreement in 2018.”

On Saturday, the German Foreign Ministry urged Kiir and Machar to put an end to the “senseless violence” and “finally implement the peace agreement.” In a joint statement last week, Berlin's embassy, along with those of Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, the UK, the US, and the European Union delegation, offered to mediate direct dialogue between the Sudanese leader and his deputy in order to restore peace.

ISTANBUL (AP) — The imprisonment of Istanbul's opposition mayor has come at a time when Turkey finds itself at the center of geopolitical turmoil that observers say has freed President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to target his most dangerous opponent.

Ekrem Imamoglu was detained in a dawn raid on his official residence last week. On Sunday, a court ordered him to be jailed pending trial for graft offenses including bid-rigging and accepting bribes. He also faces terror-related charges.

As mayor of the economic and cultural capital of Turkey with a population of 16 million, Imamoglu is probably Turkey's second-highest profile politician after Erdogan.

However, analysts say a convergence of international factors gave Erdogan the opportunity to try to neutralize the main threat to him in elections due to be held in 2028, but which could come sooner.

“There are a really special confluence of factors that made this seemingly easy for him to pull off in terms of not suffering international condemnation or punishment for it,” said Monica Marks, professor of Middle East studies at New York University Abu Dhabi.

The arrest of Imamoglu over corruption and terrorism allegations came as a bombshell last Wednesday, despite recent legal cases against district mayors from his Republican People's Party, or CHP.

Since 2016, when Erdogan faced an attempted coup, Turkey's courts have widened their crackdown on opposition parties, using charges such as graft or ties to Kurdish militants to discredit his rivals. 

The government, however, says the courts are fully independent and denies claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated.

The European Union, which usually offers criticism of Turkey's democratic slide, currently finds itself in a weaker position vis-a-vis Turkey due to “American abandonment” of European defense, Russian aggression, and its “own internal demons” from EU-sceptic forces using migration as a tool to gain relevance, according to Marks.

Ankara is in a position to offer succor in all these areas. Militarily, Turkey has NATO's second largest army in addition to a well-developed defense industry capable of supplying high-tech weaponry such as aerial drones.

During the course of the war in Ukraine, Turkey has maintained close ties with both Moscow and Kyiv and has repeatedly offered to act as a mediator in peace talks.

Turkey is also emboldened by the collapse of the Assad government in neighboring Syria at the hands of rebels it supported over the course of the war. These rebels now make up the new government.

On migration to Europe, Ankara has acted as a barrier since it signed a 2016 deal in which it agreed to prevent migrants crossing its borders and seas to reach the EU.

All these strands increase Turkey's geopolitical importance to Europe.

President Donald Trump's isolationist outlook has also strengthened Erdogan's hand, said Marks, while the “normalization of populist authoritarianism makes what Erdogan is doing less shocking, less concerning for Western democracies.”

While international elements offered Erdogan the opportunity to act against Imamoglu, the timing was due to domestic factors.

Berk Esen, a political scientist at Istanbul's Sabanci University, said the CHP's decision to confirm Imamoglu as its presidential candidate for 2028 was key to his arrest.

“Erdogan was hopeful that he could slow down, if not completely hinder, Imamoglu's candidacy prospects,” Esen said. “But when the CHP decided to hold (presidential) primaries, it became clear that Imamoglu would come out as the candidate for the CHP so Erdogan wanted to move against him right away.”

Those primaries — in which Imamoglu was the only candidate — were held Sunday, confirming the imprisoned Imamoglu as Erdogan's challenger.

Another domestic factor in Erdogan's favor was the tentative peace process begun with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has waged a 40-year insurgency against the Turkish state and is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies.

Many observers have suggested the process is, at least in part, a bid to co-opt Turkey's pro-Kurdish party into supporting Erdogan's bid for another presidential term. Similarly, it could serve to split the Kurds from the CHP, presenting Erdogan with a divided opposition, Esen said.

Imamoglu has emerged as the main challenger to Erdogan's 22-year rule since he was elected mayor of Istanbul in 2019, overturning a quarter-century of rule by parties from Turkey's conservative Islamist tradition.

According to Esen, he is the “perfect” candidate to take on Erdogan – relatively young at 53, from a conservative Sunni background but with a “modern” wife, and hailing from the Black Sea business world that offers nationwide informal connections.

He has outperformed Erdogan in recent polls and represents what Marks called the “last bastion” of Turkish opposition.

In recent years he has been the target of several criminal cases that could result in prison sentences and a political ban. Last week, a university nullified his diploma, a decision that effectively bars him from running for president.

All of which would make it seem unnecessary to arrest and jail him, risking the public backlash currently being played out in the streets of Turkey.

Selim Koru, a political analyst at the Economic Policy Research Foundation of Turkey, said the earlier cases would merely make Imamoglu seem a “perfectly fine politician who was unfairly disqualified.”

Writing in his Kulturkampf Substack, Koru added: “They had to make him into a villain to give their claims force … The strategic rationale is evident at once. The presidential elections are scheduled for 2028, so the regime wanted to get rid of Imamoglu before then, knock down the CHP while you're at it, then take a couple of years for things to calm down.”

And as to the significance putting Imamoglu behind bars, Marks said it represents the “last stop on Turkey's political train before it hits full dictatorship station.”

Greenland's people are bracing for another visit from U.S. President Donald Trump's inner circle, with second lady Usha Vance set to travel to the autonomous Danish territory this week as her husband ratchets up talk about U.S. security and “territorial” interests in the vast Arctic island coveted by the administration.

Greenland's prime minister warned Sunday of “American aggression” and lamented a “mess” caused by the upcoming visit from Vance, who will be accompanied by Trump's national security adviser and energy secretary. The same day, Vice President JD Vance — her husband — blasted Denmark for “not doing its job” and “not being a good ally.” 

“So you have to ask yourself: How are we going to solve that problem, solve our own national security?” JD Vance said on Fox News. “If that means that we need to take more territorial interest in Greenland, that is what President Trump is going to do, because he doesn't care about what the Europeans scream at us.”

Denmark is a NATO ally of the United States, and northwestern Greenland already houses the U.S. Pituffik military base that falls under the Pentagon's Space Force.




Danish national police on Sunday sent extra personnel and sniffer dogs to Greenland as part of regular security measures taken during visits by dignitaries. A police spokesperson declined to give details, but news reports said dozens were flown in. 

Before the president began his second term in January, a visit by Trump's eldest son heightened concerns in Greenland about possible U.S. ambitions. Donald Trump Jr. told its residents that “we're going to treat you well” — weeks before March 11 elections that had centered on possible independence from Denmark. 

Greenlandic news outlet Sermitsiaq posted images of two U.S. Hercules workhorse military aircraft on the tarmac Sunday in Nuuk, the capital, adding that the planes later departed. News reports said four bulletproof cars had also been flown in.

On her visit, Vance will attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race which features about 37 mushers and 444 dogs, her office said. 

Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright will also be travelling to Greenland, the White House said.

“The U.S. has a vested security interest in the Arctic region and it should not be a surprise the National Security Advisor and Secretary of Energy are visiting a U.S. Space Base to get first-hand briefings from our service members on the ground,” said Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council.

Greenland is also in the process of political transition. The pro-business Demokraatit party, which favors a slow path to independence, won a surprise victory in the recent elections, outpacing the two left-leaning parties that formed the last government. 

Greenlandic Prime Minister Múte Bourup Egede, who remains in the post until a new government is formed, acknowledged Sunday on Facebook that there is worry on the island.

The visit of “the wife of the United States vice president and the United States president's highest security adviser cannot be seen only as a private visit,” he said. “We can already see now, how big a mess it's caused.”

Egede said there would be no official meetings with the U.S. visitors because a new government has yet to be formed. 

In an interview in Sermitsiaq, he was quoted as saying that if allied countries “do not speak out loudly about how the USA is treating Greenland, the situation will escalate day by day, and the American aggression will increase.” 

He called on Greenland's allies to show support, adding that “the only purpose” of a trip by Waltz is “a demonstration of power to us, and the signal is not to be misunderstood.”

“We have been treated unacceptably,” he wrote on his Facebook account.

The likely next Greenlandic leader, Jens-Frederik Nielsen of Demokraatit, sought to calm nerves and said he was working on building a new coalition government “with the clear goal of creating security for our country and our people.”

“When foreign dignitaries travel to our country on what are called private visits, it rightly causes concern,” he wrote on Facebook. “There is no reason to panic. But there is good reason to stand together and to demand respect. I do. And I will continue to do so.”

Trump had mused during his first term about buying the world's largest island, even as Denmark insisted it wasn't for sale. The people of Greenland have also firmly rejected Trump's plans. 

Since returning to the White House, Trump has repeatedly said that the U.S. will come to control Greenland while insisting he supports the idea for strategic national security reasons — not with an eye toward American expansionism.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, in a statement Sunday reported by Danish broadcaster DR, insisted “the visit from the United States cannot be viewed independently of the public statements that have been made.”

“We want to cooperate with the Americans. But it must be a cooperation based on the fundamental values of sovereignty and respect between countries and peoples,” she was quoted as saying. 

In Brussels, a spokesperson for the European Commission said Denmark, a member of the European Union, had the bloc's full support. 

“We will continue to uphold the principles of national sovereignty, the territorial integrity of our borders, and the UN charter. These are universal principles that we stand by, and we will not stop defending them, all the more so if the territorial integrity of our member States of the European Union is questioned,” Anitta Hipper said. 

Greenland straddles strategic air and sea routes in the North Atlantic and is home to the Pituffik Space Base, which supports missile warning and space surveillance operations. 

Greenland, whose population of 56,000 people are mostly from Indigenous Inuit backgrounds, also has large deposits of the rare-earth minerals needed to make everything from mobile phones to renewable energy technology.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. negotiators worked on a proposed partial ceasefire in the the 3-year-old war in Ukraine on Monday, meeting representatives from Russia one day after holding separate talks with a team from Kyiv.



It has been a struggle to reach even a limited, 30-day ceasefire — which Moscow and Kyiv agreed to in principle last week -- with both sides continuing to attack each other with drones and missiles.



One major sticking point is what targets would be off-limits to strike, even after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders, because the parties disagree.



While the White House said “energy and infrastructure” would be covered, the Kremlin declared that the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he would also like to see infrastructure like railways and ports protected.

Talks Monday in the Saudi capital of Riyadh are expected to address some of those differences, as well as a potential pause in attacks in the Black Sea to ensure the safety of commercial shipping.





AP correspondent Naeun Kim reports on US-Russia officials holding talks right now in Saudi Arabia on a possible ceasefire in Ukraine.







U.S. and Russian representatives met in the morning, Russia's state Tass and RIA-Novosti news agencies reported. The U.S. and Ukrainian teams met Sunday.



Serhii Leshchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidency, said the delegation remained in Riyadh on Monday and expected to meet again with the Americans.

Grigory Karasin, head of the foreign affairs committee in the Russian parliament's upper house and a participant in Monday's talks, told the Interfax news agency the negotiations were going on in a “creative way” and that the U.S. and Russian delegations “understand each other's views.”



Meanwhile, both Russia and Ukraine continued to launch attacks across their borders.



The Russian Defense Ministry said Monday a Ukrainian drone attacked an oil pumping station in southern Russia that serves a pipeline carrying Kazakhstan's Caspian Sea oil to the Russian port of Novorossiisk for export. It said the drone was downed before it could reach the pumping station.



Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday the Russian military has been fulfilling President Vladimir Putin's order to halt attacks on energy facilities for 30 days. He has accused Ukraine of derailing the partial ceasefire with attacks on Russia's energy facilities, including a gas metering station in Sudzha in Russia's Kursk region.



Ukraine's military General Staff rejected Moscow's accusations and blamed the Russian military for shelling the station, a claim Peskov called “absurd.”



Zelenskyy said Sunday evening that “since March 11, a proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table, and these attacks could have already stopped. But it is Russia that continues all this.”



He added that Ukraine's partners — “the U.S., Europe, and others around the world” — should increase pressure on Russia “to stop this terror.”

Zelenskyy has emphasized that Ukraine is open to Trump's proposal of a full, 30-day ceasefire. Putin has made a complete ceasefire conditional on a halt of arms supplies to Kyiv and a suspension of Ukraine's military mobilization — demands rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies.



Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said he expected “some real progress” at talks and that a pause in hostilities by both countries in the Black Sea would “naturally gravitate into a full-on shooting ceasefire.”







Asked about reports speculating that China might send peacekeepers to Ukraine to enforce any peace deal, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun responded Monday with an unequivocal no. 



“Let me stress that the report is completely false. China's position on the Ukraine crisis is clear and consistent,” Guo said at a briefing. 



China has provided Russia with trade earnings from oil and other natural resources, along with diplomatic backing, but has not given any weapons or sent any personnel. China is, however, on close terms with North Korea, which has sent troops to fight alongside the Russian army.



A “massive targeted cyberattack” hit Ukrainian state railway operator Ukrzaliznytsia on Sunday, the company wrote on Telegram, adding that it was working to restore its systems on Monday. The company said the attack did not affect train movements or schedules but disrupted its online booking system.



“The railway continues to operate despite physical attacks on the infrastructure, and even the most vile cyberattacks cannot stop it,” the company wrote.



Meanwhile, Ukraine's Special Operations Forces claimed Monday it destroyed four military helicopters in Russia's Belgorod region with the use of U.S.-supplied HIMARS rocket systems. It published drone footage on its Telegram page of what it said was the attack.



The strikes occurred at a concealed “jumping-off point” for Russian aircraft used in surprise attacks on Ukrainian forces, the group said.



A Russian missile struck the northern city of Sumy, across the border from Russia's Kursk region, hitting residential buildings and a school, said regional head Volodymyr Artiukh. Children at the school were being evacuated at the time, and all were safe, he added.



But the regional prosecutor's office said 65 people were injured, including 14 children.



Earlier, Russia fired 99 attack and decoy drones into Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine's air force, of which 57 were shot down.

ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkish authorities detained several journalists from their homes, a media workers' union said Monday, calling it a crackdown amid growing protests triggered by the jailing of Istanbul's mayor, a top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

A court on Sunday formally arrested Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and ordered him jailed pending a trial on corruption charges. His detention on Wednesday sparked the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade, deepening concerns over democracy and the rule of law.

The Disk-Basin-Is union said at least eight reporters and photojournalists were detained in what it called an “attack on press freedoms and the people's right to learn the truth.” It called for their immediate release.

The social media platform X said it was objecting to multiple court orders from Turkish authorities to block more than 700 accounts, including of news organizations, journalists and political figures in Turkey.




A total of 1,133 people have been detained since the mayor was arrested at his home, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said. As many as 123 police officers were injured in the protests, he said, adding that materials such as acid, firebombs and knives were seized.

“Some circles have been exploiting the right to assemble and demonstrate, attempting to disrupt public order, incite street unrest and attack our police,” Yerlikaya said on social media.

The minister said some of the detained were identified as having ties to groups listed as terrorist organizations and others had criminal records.

Hundreds of thousands of people have come out for the largely peaceful protests across Turkey in support of the mayor. There has been some violence, with police deploying water cannons, tear gas and pepper spray and firing plastic pellets at protesters in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. Some protesters hurled stones, fireworks and other objects at riot police.

In a message on social media, Imamoglu urged people to rally outside city hall and other locations for a sixth night on Monday. He also called on youths to avoid clashes and asked police to treat demonstrators with kindness.

“I'm working hard, I will work even harder. Where I am does not matter,” he said.

The mayor's jailing is widely regarded as a political move to remove a major challenger to Erdogan from the next presidential race, scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject the accusations and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently.

Imamoglu was jailed on suspicion of running a criminal organization, accepting bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and bid-rigging — accusations he has denied. A request for him to be imprisoned on terror-related charges was rejected although he still faces prosecution.

The Interior Ministry later said Imamoglu had been suspended from duty as a “temporary measure.” The municipality previously appointed an acting mayor from its governing council.

Imamoglu was taken to Silivri prison, west of Istanbul, as more than 1.7 million members of his opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, held a primary election, endorsing him as its presidential candidate. Millions of non-members also cast votes in a “solidarity ballot,” the party said.

Alongside Imamoglu, 47 other people were also jailed pending trial, including a key aide and two district mayors from Istanbul. One was replaced with a government appointee. A further 44 suspects were released under judicial control.

Meanwhile, authorities were investigating the office of Ankara's mayor, another popular opposition figure, over the alleged misuse of public funds concerning the organization of 33 concerts, the municipality said Monday. It said the decision was made even though the concerts had been thoroughly audited.

Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019, in a major blow to Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. Erdogan's party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.

The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which the CHP made significant gains against Erdogan's governing party.

Palestinians in the Gaza Strip mourned their dead on Monday, following overnight Israeli strikes which killed 25, including women and children.

Israeli officials say an attacker in a vehicle ran over several people at a bus stop in northern Israel before opening fire, killing a man in his 70s.

Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip have killed more than 60 Palestinians, including women and children, the Gaza Health Ministry said Monday, nearly a week after Israel broke its ceasefire with Hamas with a surprise bombardment.



Meanwhile, officials say Egypt has introduced a new proposal to try and get the Gaza ceasefire back on track.

Hamas would release five living hostages, including an American-Israeli, in return for Israel allowing humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and a weekslong pause in the fighting, an Egyptian official said Monday. Israel would also release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.



A Hamas official said the group had “responded positively” to the proposal, without elaborating. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media on the closed-door talks.

Here's the latest:







Qatar's Al Jazeera satellite news network says one of its Palestinian freelance reporters, Hossam Shabat, was killed by an Israeli airstrike on his car in northern Gaza.

AP correspondent Naeun Kim reports on Israel's deadly renewed assault in Gaza, including the bombing of a hospital.



Shabat was killed Monday while covering the war for the broadcaster's Arabic-language TV channel, the network said. He had been wounded by an Israeli strike last November, the network reported at the time.



Another Palestinian journalist was killed in a separate Israeli airstrike earlier Monday in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital. Mohammed Mansour was a correspondent for the news website Palestine Today.






Al Jazeera is one of the few international media outlets to remain in Gaza throughout the war. The channel is owned by Qatar, which alongside Egypt and the U.S. has been a key negotiator for the ceasefire.



The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike that killed Shabat.

Israel has accused other Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza of being Palestinian militants. The channel denies the accusations and says Israel is trying to silence journalists covering the war.







An Israeli anti-settlement group says there has been an “unprecedented surge” in approvals for new settler homes in the occupied West Bank since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office.



During his first term, Trump strongly backed Israel's claims to territories seized in war, at times upending decades of American foreign policy. Previous administrations have admonished Israel over settlement expansion while taking little action to curb it.



The Peace Now group, which closely tracks settlement growth, said Monday that plans for 10,503 housing units in the West Bank have been advanced since the start of the year, compared to just 9,971 in all of 2024. It says another 1,344 homes are set to be approved on Wednesday.

Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution. 



Israel has built well over 100 settlements that are now home to over 500,000 settlers with Israeli citizenship. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.







The Israeli military says a senior Hamas leader killed in a strike on a hospital in the Gaza Strip was in charge of the group's finances.



Ismail Barhoum was killed in an Israeli strike late Sunday on Nasser Hospital, where Hamas said he was receiving treatment. The strike also killed a teenage boy recovering from surgery. 



The military said Monday that Barhoum oversaw Hamas' finances in Gaza and transferred funds to its military wing. It said he was also serving as the head of Hamas' government in Gaza after replacing another senior official killed in a strike last week.



Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani denied that Barhoum was receiving medical treatment in the hospital, saying he had been there for weeks meeting with other senior militants.



Israel has killed most of Hamas' top leaders and scores of mid-level commanders during the 17-month war. The group was still able to quickly reassert control over the territory during a ceasefire that took hold in January.







The Gaza Health Ministry said Monday the bodies of 61 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to hospitals over the past 24 hours. 



Hospitals also received 143 wounded, it said in its daily report.



The overall Palestinian death toll from the Israel-Hamas war rose to at least 50,082, the ministry said. Another 113,408 have been wounded, it said. Its figures do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. 











The Palestinian Civil Defense says it has lost contact with six of its members who went on a rescue mission in the southern city of Rafah in the Gaza Strip.



The group said its members along with others from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society went to Rafah Sunday morning after receiving calls that Israeli troops entered the area of Hashasheen in west Rafah.



It added in a statement Monday that since then there has been no word from the paramedics. 



Palestinian medics say an Israeli strike hit a school where displaced people were sheltering in the Gaza Strip, killing at least four people, including a child.



Another 18 people were wounded in Monday's strike in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. Three other hospitals had earlier reported 25 deaths from Israeli strikes overnight and into Monday.



There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas.











Israeli officials say an attacker in a vehicle ran over several people at a bus stop in northern Israel before opening fire, killing a man in his 70s.



Police said officers shot and killed the attacker, whose identity was not immediately disclosed. Police referred to it as a terrorist attack, indicating they believe the assailant was a Palestinian militant.



Israel's Magen David Adom emergency service said a man in his 70s was killed and another man, around 20 years old, was taken to a hospital in serious condition.



There has been a surge in Palestinian attacks since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack into southern Israel ignited the war in the Gaza Strip.



At the same time, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank during wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in attacks by Jewish settlers on Palestinians.







Thousands of people are trapped in the city of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip after Israeli forces encircled part of it on Sunday, Palestinian officials said.



Israel ordered the evacuation of the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood, telling people to leave by a single route on foot to Muwasi, a sprawling cluster of tent camps along the coast.



Thousands fled, but residents said many were trapped by Israeli forces.



The Rafah municipality said Monday that thousands were still trapped, including first responders from the Civil Defense, which operates under the Hamas-run government, and the Palestinian Red Crescent.

Israel's defense minister says it is trying to avoid harming civilians as it strikes Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.



Israel Katz's statement came nearly a week after Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to local health officials.



Katz said Monday that “Israel is not fighting the civilians in Gaza and is doing everything that international law requires to mitigate harm to civilians.”



He went on to blame Hamas for any civilian deaths, saying the militant group “fights in civilian dress, from civilian homes, and from behind civilians,” putting them in danger.



He said Israel would not halt its offensive until Hamas releases all its hostages and is no longer in control of Gaza or a threat to Israel.

Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 25 Palestinians, including several women and children, according to three hospitals. The strikes come nearly a week after Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas with a surprise bombardment that killed hundreds.



Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City received 11 bodies from strikes overnight into Monday, including three women and four children. One of the strikes killed two children, their parents, their grandmother and their uncle.



Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis received seven bodies from strikes overnight and four from strikes the previous day. The European Hospital received three bodies from a strike near Khan Younis.



Gaza's Health Ministry said Sunday that the Palestinian death toll from the 17-month war has passed 50,000. It has said that women and children make up more than half the dead but does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count.



Israel says it has killed some 20,000 militants, without providing evidence. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war.







An American trauma surgeon working in Gaza says most of the patients injured in an Israeli attack on the largest hospital in southern Gaza had been previously wounded when Israel resumed airstrikes last week.



Californian surgeon Feroze Sidhwa, who is working with the medical charity MedGlobal, said Monday he had been in the intensive care unit at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis when an airstrike hit surgical wards on Sunday.



Most of the injured had been recovering from wounds suffered in airstrikes last week when Israel resumed the war, he said.



“They were already trauma patients and now they've been traumatized for a second time,” Sidhwa, who was raised in Flint, Mich., told Australian Broadcasting Corp.



Sidhwa said he had operated on a man and boy days before who died in the attack.

PARIS (AP) — French actor Gérard Depardieu went on trial Monday in Paris on charges of sexually assaulting two women on a movie set, in a case seen as a potential watershed for the #MeToo movement in France. 

Depardieu, 76, is accused of having groped a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant director during filming in 2021 of “Les Volets Verts” (“The Green Shutters”). 

The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted. 

Depardieu denies any wrongdoing. He told the judges that he was prepared to answer the court's questions.

“We will be able to show in an impartial, objective and incontestable manner that all of the accusations are lies,” his attorney, Jérémie Assous, told journalists massed outside the courtroom.

“The truth will be obvious and the truth is on our side,” he said.

Depardieu's long and storied career has turned the trial into a post- #MeToo test of the willingness of France and its movie industry to confront sexual violence and hold influential men accountable.

Depardieu has been a darling of French cinemagoers for decades and was Oscar-nominated in 1991 for his performance as swordsman and poet Cyrano de Bergerac.

But his alleged boorish behavior off-screen has also long made headlines. He has been accused publicly or in formal complaints of misconduct by more than 20 women, but so far only the sexual assault case has proceeded to court. Some others were dropped because of a lack of evidence or the statute of limitations.




Feminist and historian Florence Montreynaud described Depardieu's court appearance as “a historic moment” for women's rights, as she joined other campaigners who demonstrated outside the court. A dozen chanted “Sexist violence, complicit judicial system” as they danced to techno music.

“Times are changing. “#MeToo has swept through. At last, mentalities are changing,” Montreynaud said to French broadcaster BFMTV.

The trial also follows in the wake of the historic case last year involving Gisèle Pelicot, whose bravery put the spotlight on sexual violence in France. She demanded that the drugging-and-rape trial for 51 men tried for a horrific catalogue of abuse on her be held in open court, arguing that doing so would help make shame change sides. 

France has often been ambivalent — even resistant — toward the #MeToo movement. While Hollywood saw powerful men fall swiftly and publicly, the French film industry was slower to respond. Some dismissed #MeToo as an American export incompatible with French values, citing concerns over free expression and what they viewed as an erosion of flirtation culture.

At the time of the alleged assaults, Depardieu was already under formal investigation for rape. In 2018, actor Charlotte Arnould accused him of raping her at his home. That case is still active, and in August 2024, prosecutors requested that it go to trial.

Prosecutors say Depardieu trapped the set dresser with his legs before groping her waist and breasts in front of witnesses. She says the actor also used obscene language and had to be pulled away by bodyguards.

The assistant director alleged that Depardieu groped her both on set and in the street.

The women sat side by side in court. The Associated Press doesn't name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified. Neither has done so in this case.

The trial is expected to last at least two days, but could be extended beyond Tuesday, if the chief judge wants more time. The trial was initially scheduled for October, but then postponed because of Depardieu's health. A verdict is expected at a later date. 

Depardieu grasped his lawyer's shoulder as he strode calmly into the courtroom. The actor has undergone a quadruple heart bypass and has diabetes, according to his lawyer. A court-appointed medical expert determined that he's fit to stand trial, but recommended that the hearings don't exceed six hours, with a 15-minute pause and snack every three hours.

The first hours of Monday's hearing were largely taken up by Depardieu's lawyer, who sought to cast doubt on witness testimony and the police investigation. The attorney alleged, without providing evidence, that police acted under instructions from magistrates who led the investigation to “make Depardieu fall.” 

Depardieu listened intently, sometimes nodding.

The plaintiffs' lawyers were expected to lay out their evidence later. One of the lawyers, Carine Durrieu Diebolt, said on France Info radio before the trial opened that “the case is solid” and that her client is “calmly awaiting the outcome.”

She said that four additional women who say they have been sexually assaulted by Depardieu will testify.

In an open letter published in October 2023, Depardieu wrote: “Never, but never, have I abused a woman.”

The actor had dropped out of sight in recent months, his film career seemingly on hold. But he still has friends in the industry. Actors Vincent Perez and Fanny Ardant were among those who took seats on his side of the courtroom.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's Constitutional Court overturned the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, reinstating the nation's No. 2 official as acting leader Monday while not yet ruling on the separate impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol over his shocking imposition of martial law in December.

Many observers said the 7-1 ruling in Han's case did not signal much about the upcoming verdict on Yoon, as Han wasn't a key figure in imposing martial law. But the ruling could still embolden Yoon's staunch supporters and ramp up their political offensive on the opposition.

Speaking with reporters following his reinstatement, Han thanked the court for what he called “a wise decision” and promised to focus on tackling “urgent matters,” including a fast-changing global trade environment, in an apparent reference to the Trump administration's aggressive tariffs policy. He also called for national unity, saying: “There's no left or right — what matters is the advancement of our nation.”

South Korea has been thrown into political turmoil since Yoon, a conservative, declared martial law on Dec. 3 and sent hundreds of troops to the liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly and other places in Seoul. Yoon's decree lasted only six hours as enough lawmakers managed to enter an assembly hall where they quickly voted down the decree.

The assembly impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, alleging he violated the Constitution and other laws by suppressing assembly activities and trying to detain politicians. Yoon's impeachment made Han acting president until he was impeached in late December.

The unprecedented, successive impeachments that suspended the country's top two officials intensified domestic division and deepened worries about South Korea's diplomatic and economic activities. 

A major trigger for the opposition's push to impeach Han was his refusal to fill three vacant seats at the Constitutional Court's nine-member bench. That was a highly explosive issue because the court needed support from at least six justices to approve Yoon's impeachment and filling its empty posts could make such a decision more likely.

After Han was suspended, his successor as acting president, Choi Sang-mok, appointed two new justices but left the ninth seat vacant.

Han was also accused in the impeachment motion of abetting Yoon's martial law declaration and obstructing efforts to open independent investigations into Yoon's alleged rebellion in connection with his martial law decree. 

On Monday, seven of the Constitutional Court's eight justices ruled to overturn or dismiss Han's impeachment. They ruled that his alleged actions weren't against the law or weren't serious enough to remove him from office or his impeachment motion didn't even met a required quorum when it passed thorough the assembly. One justice upheld Han's impeachment.

The main liberal opposition Democratic Party expressed regret over the court's decision to reinstate Han and urged it to dismiss Yoon quickly. Yoon's office welcomed Monday's ruling, saying it shows again the opposition's repeated uses of impeachment motions were “reckless, malicious political offensive.”

Observers earlier had predicted the Constitutional Court would rule on Yoon's case in mid-March, but it hasn't done so, sparking varied speculation on possible reasons. 

“Today's verdict will give hope to Yoon's supporters for a similar fate and hope for Yoon's opponents for his ouster,” said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. “But it's too soon to predict the court's verdict on Yoon because the specific details of both cases and allegations are different.”

Kim said the reinstatement of Han, a career bureaucrat, will bring more stability to South Korea compared to when his powers as acting president were suspended.

Massive rival rallies backing or denouncing Yoon have divided the streets of Seoul and other major cities in South Korea. Earlier surveys showed that a majority of South Koreans were critical of Yoon's martial law enactment, but those supporting or sympathizing with Yoon have later gained strength.

Yoon argues that his martial law introduction was a desperate attempt to bring attention to the “wickedness” of the Democratic Party which obstructed his agenda and filed many impeachment motions against senior officials. Yoon critics counter he likely tried to use military rule to frustrate possible special investigations into scandals involving him and his wife. 

Senior military and police officers sent to the assembly have said that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to prevent a floor vote to overturn his decree. Yoon says the troops' deployment was designed to maintain order. 

If the court upholds Yoon's impeachment, South Korea must hold a presidential election to choose his successor. If it rules for him, Yoon will regain his presidential powers.

Yoon has separately been charged with directing rebellion, a charge that carries the death penalty or a life sentence if he is convicted.

PARIS (AP) — Gérard Depardieu won't just be facing two women who accuse him of sexual assault when he walks into a Paris courtroom on Monday. France's most famous male actor will also be confronting a nation long criticized for failing to address sexual violence — particularly when committed by its most powerful figures.

Depardieu, 76, is accused of assaulting a set dresser and an assistant director during the 2021 filming of “Les Volets Verts” (“The Green Shutters”). While more than 20 women have publicly accused him of sexual misconduct, this is the first time one of those cases has gone to trial.

It is also the most prominent post- #MeToo -era case in France, testing whether a country famed for its culture of seduction is prepared to hold its cultural titans accountable.

Prosecutors say Depardieu trapped one of the women with his legs before groping her waist and breasts in front of witnesses. In an interview with investigative outlet Mediapart, the 54-year-old set dresser said Depardieu shouted on set that he “couldn't even get it up” because of the heat, then told her: “Come and touch my big parasol. I'll stick it in your (nether regions).” She said he then grabbed her forcefully and had to be pulled away by bodyguards.

A second woman, a 34-year-old assistant director, alleged she was groped both on set and in the street. The plaintiffs' identities have not been disclosed to protect alleged victims of sexual violence.

Depardieu has denied all allegations. 




In an open letter published in Le Figaro in Oct. 2023, he wrote: “Never, but never, have I abused a woman. To think that I have hurt someone or made them feel uncomfortable is intolerable to me.” 

He added, “I have only ever been guilty of being too loving, too generous, or of having a temperament that is too strong.”

His lawyer, Jérémie Assous, called the case baseless and said Depardieu — who recently underwent a quadruple bypass and has diabetes — will attend the two-day trial, reportedly with breaks scheduled to accommodate his health condition.

France has often been ambivalent — even resistant — toward the #MeToo movement. While Hollywood saw powerful men fall swiftly and publicly, the French film industry was slower to respond. Some dismissed #MeToo as an American export incompatible with French values, citing concerns over free expression and what they viewed as an erosion of flirtation culture.

Roman Polanski, convicted in the United States of unlawful sex with a minor and accused by several other women, continues to live and work in France with near-total impunity. Despite international outcry, he remains a decorated figure in French cinema. His 2020 César Award for Best Director — for “An Officer and a Spy” — prompted several women, including actress Adèle Haenel, to walk out of the ceremony in protest. 

Yet the industry offered little institutional pushback, highlighting a deep-rooted reluctance to confront abuse when it involves revered cultural figures.

In February, director Christophe Ruggia was convicted of sexually abusing Haenel when she was a child. The actress, who had already quit the film industry in protest, has become one of the country's most prominent voices on abuse.

Judith Godrèche, an actor and filmmaker, has also emerged as a leading figure. In February 2024, in a televised testimony, she addressed a French parliamentary commission, accusing directors Benoît Jacquot and Jacques Doillon of sexually exploiting her as a teenager — allegations both men deny. “This is not about desire or love,” she told lawmakers. “It is about power. It is about a system that enables silence.”

That same commission has called major actors and producers — including Jean Dujardin — to testify. Several reportedly requested that their appearances be held behind closed doors.

Anouk Grinberg, a respected actor who appeared in “Les Volets Verts”, has publicly supported the plaintiffs. She described Depardieu's behavior as vulgar and disturbing, saying she felt “a sense of shame” on set.

At the time of the alleged 2021 assaults, Depardieu was already under formal investigation for rape. In 2018, actor Charlotte Arnould accused him of raping her at his home. That case is still active, and in August 2024, prosecutors requested it go to trial.

Over a career spanning five decades, Depardieu starred in more than 200 films, including “Cyrano de Bergerac”, “Jean de Florette”, “Green Card”, and “The Man in the Iron Mask”. But his off-screen controversies have long made headlines, from drunk driving to urinating in the aisle of a plane. 

A 2023 France Télévisions documentary, “La Chute de l'Ogre” (“The Fall of the Ogre”), reignited debate about his impunity. It showed footage of the actor during a 2018 trip to North Korea, making sexually inappropriate remarks to a female interpreter and appearing to sexualize a young girl riding a horse.

For decades, behavior like this was dismissed as part of his larger-than-life persona. Today, that legacy is under direct challenge.

Godrèche, who told lawmakers she was 14 when Jacquot first exploited her, has called for reforms to France's statute of limitations on child sex crimes and new protections for minors in the arts. Her testimony — alongside those of other survivors — has brought rare political attention to a culture of silence that many say pervades French cinema.

Still, resistance remains.

In 2018, actor Catherine Deneuve and more than 100 prominent French women signed an open letter in Le Monde newspaper defending what they called a “freedom to bother.” The letter argued that flirtation should not be conflated with harassment and warned against American-style puritanism.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched a barrage of drones across Ukraine overnight Sunday that killed at least seven people, according to local Ukrainian officials and emergency services.

The attacks, including on the capital, Kyiv, came ahead of ceasefire negotiations in Saudi Arabia in which Ukraine and Russia are expected to hold indirect U.S.-mediated talks on Monday to discuss a pause in long-range attacks targeting energy facilities and civilian infrastructure.

The Ukrainian delegation is expected to meet with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia a day ahead of the indirect talks, Ukraine's President Voldoymyr Zelenskyy said. Ukraine is planning to send technical teams to discuss the details of the partial ceasefire. 

Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said he expected “some real progress” at the talks in Saudi Arabia, “particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries, and from that you'll naturally gravitate into a full-on shooting ceasefire.”

Asked about concerns that Russian President Vladimir Putin may be looking beyond Ukraine and could press further into Europe, even if Russia is awarded territory within Ukraine now, Witkoff said he has been asked his opinion on what Putin's motives are on a large scale.

“I simply have said that I just don't see that he wants to take all of Europe. This is a much different situation than it was in World War II. In World War II there was no NATO. You have countries that are armed there. I take him at his word in this sense. And I think the Europeans are beginning to come to that belief, too. But it sort of doesn't matter. That's an academic issue. … The agenda is stop the killing, stop the carnage, let's end this thing.”

Asked whether he was convinced that Putin wanted peace, Witkoff said: “I feel that he wants peace.”

Russia launched 147 drones across Ukraine overnight, according to the Ukrainian Air Force. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 97, and 25 others didn't reach targets due to Ukrainian countermeasures. The attacks struck the Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Odesa and Donetsk regions, as well as the capital, Kyiv.

Three people, including a 5-year-old child, were killed and 10 others were injured in a drone attack on Kyiv, the city's military administration said. Extended sounds of explosions were heard across the Ukrainian capital in the early hours as the air raid blared for over five hours. Russian drones and debris from shot-down drones, which were flying at lower altitudes to evade air defenses, fell on residential buildings. 

Residents in Kyiv surveyed the damage done to their homes and neighborhoods on Sunday morning. Many were disparaging of the upcoming ceasefire talks, pointing to the burned out properties destroyed in the drone attack, saying these were more indicative of Russia's true intentions.

In an old multistory building on Kyiv's left bank that was damaged in the overnight attack, Dmytro Zapadnya, 37, said he had no faith in Russia upholding any ceasefire agreement.

“There is no point in signing anything (with Russians), because it will not be worth the cost of paper where you put this signature. Well, the only thing that is not very pleasant is that now the United States seems to have little understanding of our situation,” he said.

Elsewhere, four people were killed in Russian attacks on Ukraine's Donetsk region, regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said, including three who died in a strike on the frontline town of Dobropillya.

In a statement on social media, Zelenskyy said attacks such as the one in Kyiv were a daily occurrence for Ukraine.

“This week alone, more than 1,580 guided aerial bombs, almost 1,100 strike drones and 15 missiles of various types were used against our people,” he said. “New solutions are needed, with new pressure on Moscow to stop both these strikes and this war.”

Also on Sunday, Russia's Ministry of Defense said it had shot down 59 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 29 over the region of Rostov and 20 more over southwestern Astrakhan. In Rostov, one person was killed and a car caught fire due to the Ukrainian drone attack, according to the area's temporary governor, Yuri Slyusar.

A woman also died in the Russian border village of Novostroyevka-Pervaya in the Belgorod region when a Ukrainian drone hit a car in which she was traveling.

The driver, the woman's daughter, was also seriously injured in the attack, said local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel's military struck the largest hospital in southern Gaza on Sunday night, killing two people, wounding others and causing a large fire, the territory's Health Ministry said.

The strike hit the surgical building of Nasser Hospital in the city of Khan Younis, the ministry said, days after the facility was overwhelmed with dead and wounded when Israel resumed the war in Gaza last week with a surprise wave of airstrikes.

Those killed in Sunday night's strike included a 16-year-old boy who underwent surgery two days ago, according to the Health Ministry. Also killed was Ismail Barhoum, a member of Hamas' political bureau, who was being treated at the hospital, Hamas said in a statement.

Israel's military confirmed the strike on the hospital, saying it hit a Hamas militant operating there. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas.

Like other medical facilities around Gaza, Nasser Hospital has been damaged by Israeli raids and strikes throughout the war.

More than 50,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the war, the Health Ministry said earlier Sunday.

The military claimed to have “eliminated” dozens of militants since Israel ended a ceasefire Tuesday with strikes that killed hundreds of people on one of the deadliest days in the 17-month war.

Israel's unrest over Gaza and political issues grew Sunday, with anger at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as his government voted to express no confidence in the attorney general, seen by many as a check on the power of his coalition.

“I'm worried for the future of this country. And I think it has to stop. We have to change direction,” said Avital Halperin, one of hundreds of protesters outside Netanyahu's office. Police said three were arrested.

Israel's military ordered thousands of Palestinians to leave the heavily destroyed Tel al-Sultan neighborhood in the southern city of Rafah. They walked to Muwasi, a sprawling area of squalid tent camps. The war has forced most of Gaza's population of over 2 million to flee within the territory, often multiple times.

“It's displacement under fire,” said Mustafa Gaber, a journalist who left with his family. He said tank and drone fire echoed nearby.

“The shells are falling among us and the bullets are (flying) above us,” said Amal Nassar, also displaced. “The elderly have been thrown into the streets. An old woman was telling her son, ‘Go and leave me to die.' Where will we go?”

“Enough is enough. We are exhausted,” said a fleeing Ayda Abu Shaer, as smoke rose in the distance.

Israel's military said it had fired on advancing “suspicious vehicles” and later discovered some were ambulances and fire trucks.

In Gaza City, an explosion hit next to a tent camp where people had been told to evacuate. “My husband is blind and started running barefoot, and my children were running,” said witness Nidaa Hassuna.

Hamas said Salah Bardawil, a well-known member of its political bureau, was killed in a strike in Muwasi that also killed his wife. Israel's military confirmed it.

Hospitals in southern Gaza said they received a further 24 bodies from strikes overnight, including several women and children.

Gaza's Health Ministry said 50,021 Palestinians have been killed in the war, including 673 people since Israel's bombardment on Tuesday shattered the ceasefire.

Dr. Munir al-Boursh, the ministry's general director, said the dead include 15,613 children, with 872 of them under 1 year old.

The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says women and children make up over half the dead. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 fighters, without providing evidence.

The ceasefire that took hold in January paused more than a year of fighting ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage. Most captives have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.

In the latest ceasefire's first phase, 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others were released in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces allowed hundreds of thousands of people to return home. There was a surge in humanitarian aid until Israel cut off all supplies to Gaza earlier this month to pressure Hamas to change the ceasefire agreement.

The sides were supposed to begin negotiations in early February on the ceasefire's next phase, in which Hamas was to release the remaining 59 hostages — 35 of them believed to be dead — in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. Those talks never began.

Israel's Cabinet passed a measure creating 13 new settlements in the occupied West Bank by rezoning existing ones, according to Bezalel Smotrich, Israel's far-right finance minister, who is in charge of settlement construction.

This brings the number of settlements, considered illegal by the majority of the international community, to 140, said anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now. They will receive independent budgets from Israel and can elect their own local governments, the group said.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels pounded sites across the country overnight and into Monday, with the group saying the one attack in the capital killed at least one person and wounded more than a dozen others.

The American strikes on the rebels, who threaten maritime trade and Israel, entered their 10th day without any sign of stopping. They are part of a campaign by U.S. President Donald Trump targeting the rebel group while also trying to pressure Iran, the Houthis' main benefactor. 

So far, the U.S. has not offered any specifics on the sites it is striking, though Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz claimed the attacks have “taken out key Houthi leadership, including their head missileer.” That's something so far that's not been acknowledged by the Houthis, though the rebels have downplayed their losses in the past and exaggerated their attacks attempting to target American warships.

“We've hit their headquarters,” Waltz told CBS' “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “We've hit communications nodes, weapons factories and even some of their over-the-water drone production facilities.” 

An apparent U.S. strike Sunday hit a building in a western neighborhood of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, killing at least one person and wounding 13 others, the rebel-controlled SABA news agency said, citing health officials. Footage released by the rebels showed the rubble of a collapsed building and pools of blood staining the gray dust covering the ground. 




A building next to the collapsed structure still stood, suggesting American forces likely used a lower-yield warhead in the strike. 

The Houthis also described American airstrikes targeting sites around the city of Saada, a Houthi stronghold, the Red Sea port city of Hodeida and Marib province, home to oil and gas fields still under the control of allies to Yemen's exiled central government. 

The campaign of airstrikes targeting the rebels, which killed at least 53 people immediately after they began March 15, started after the Houthis threatened to begin targeting “Israeli” ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels in the past have had a loose definition of what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning other vessels could be targeted as well.

The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting ships from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships, though none have been hit so far.

The attacks greatly raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decadelong stalemated war that has torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation.

NEW DELHI (AP) — A comedian popular for his biting political humor is being investigated for possible defamation over jokes made about an Indian state leader who is an ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in yet another case raising questions over freedom of speech in the country.

Police in the western city of Mumbai opened the investigation Monday against Kunal Kamra over a comedy skit referring to Eknath Shinde, the second highest elected leader of Maharashtra state, following a complaint filed by a politician from Shinde's Shiv Sena party. 

Kamra had made the remarks in a comedy skit, but it was unclear when the performance took place.

A video clip of the skit Kamra posted on his Instagram profile on Sunday showed him taunting Shinde in a parody song. Kamra's use of the term “traitor” particularly triggered Shiv Sena party workers and on Sunday they ransacked the studio where he had performed the skit. 

Police are also investigating the vandalism. 

One lawmaker from the party Sunday threatened Kamra, saying he would be chased by the party workers throughout the country. “You will be forced to flee India,” lawmaker Naresh Mhaske warned Kamra in a video message.

Shinde has not commented about the matter, but Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said Kamra should apologize for his remarks.

“We respect freedom of expression, but recklessness will not be tolerated,” Fadnavis told reporters.




Kamra has made no comment on the investigation, but late Sunday he shared on his Instagram a picture of himself holding the Indian Constitution with caption: “The only way forward.”

The Habitat Comedy Club, where Kamra had performed, said it was shutting down following the vandalism.

“We are shocked, worried and extremely broken by the recent acts of vandalism targeting us,” it said in a statement Monday, adding that the club will remain shut “till we figure out the best way to provide a platform for free expression without putting ourselves and our property in jeopardy.”

Kamra has faced the ire of Hindu nationalist groups and political parties in the past, particularly for jokes about Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party politicians.

Other Indian comedians have been arrested or had shows canceled for making fun of politicians or making references to the Hindu religion or national icons.

        The UN predicts that as many as 3.5 million refugees and IDPs may return to their homes in Syria this year, and says more aid and funding is needed.
    

Syria is at a critical juncture as the country attempts to rebuild and reintegrate citizens returning to their homes amid a worsening humanitarian crisis, the UN has warned.

Since the ouster of former President Bashar al-Assad in December, about 1.2 million Syrians have gone home, including 885,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 302,000 refugees, according to the latest data from the UN Humanitarian Coordinator.

Half of Syrians returning from outside the country came from Lebanon, 22% from Türkiye and 13% from Iraq, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) says. More than a quarter of those who have returned to their places of origin are residing in damaged or unfinished buildings, according to the IOM.

The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) predicts that as many as 3.5 million refugees and IDPs may return home this year, with people hopeful of a fresh start after 14 years of civil war.

The regime of al-Assad had tried to market the idea of a ""safe return"" for refugees in recent years, but many of those who did come back under his rule were arrested or  forcibly conscripted into the army, while reconstruction of the country was very limited.

UN agencies and NGOs have warned of the challenges in reintegrating returnees, including a lack of basic services, security risks and missing legal documentation.

At least 7 million people remain displaced across the country, and severe economic challenges — from cash shortages to limited power — are hampering efforts to deliver aid, the UN said last week. 

As of mid-March, the $1.25 billion (€1.15bn) UN-coordinated humanitarian response for the country was only 12.5% funded, with vital sectors such as shelter, non-food relief, water and sanitation, and agriculture and nutrition suffering from lack of resources.

""The cost of inaction [...] is much more expensive than responding to the immediate needs of the Syrian people,"" the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Syria, Adam Abdelmoula, said in a briefing last week. 

Abdelmoula said that recent hostilities in northern, southern and coastal Syria had displaced thousands of people anew and created difficulties for aid delivery.

While there was relative stability after the toppling of al-Assad in early December by insurgent groups led by the Islamist Islamic Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, fresh violence broke out earlier this month between al-Assad loyalists from his Alawite minority ethnic group and government security forces.

More than 1,000 people died during several days of fighting, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group, which said the death toll from the clashes was one of the highest in the decade. 

Days after the violence that reopened the wounds of the civil war,** the interim government — led by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa — struck a deal with the Kurdish-led authority that controls the country's northeast. 

Al-Sharaa also signed a temporary constitution that leaves Syria under Islamist rule while promising to protect the rights of all Syrians for five years during a transitional phase.

Speaking at a donor conference in Brussels last week, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi urged greater global support and funding for displaced Syrians. 

He said that there must be shelter, electricity, water, sanitation, education, work for people who return to their communities, as well as respect for their rights.

""But if we fail to help them stay in Syria, make no mistakes: the impact will be disastrous. Not only returns will stop, but those who did return (and probably many others) will move again,"" Grandi told the conference.

        The copper price surged toward an all-time high on concerns of potential Trump tariffs, alongside China's stimulus measures. A weak US dollar may have also added to its rally.
    

Copper is one of the best market performers this year, up 27% amid Trump's tariff concerns and China's further stimulus measures mapped out last week. Copper futures prices at COMEX rose to as much as $5.15 per pound last Thursday, nearing a record high seen in May 2024. The base metal's price retreated slightly to $5.12 per pound during Monday's Asian session.

The industrial metal has become increasingly crucial, with demands surging for electrification in batteries-powered vehicles, artificial intelligence (AI) boom, and the world's transition to renewable energy. 

On the other hand, copper has been in supply constraints due to a lack of mineral investment and reduced refinery capabilities. Against the backdrop of undersupply, Trump's tariff threats, China's renewed stimulus measures, and the US dollar's weakness this year have collectively contributed to the price surge.

“A part of the copper story is China's stimulus and recovery, the other part is tariffs. We could be seeing a boost in demand at a time when higher prices could restrict the supply side. The weaker dollar (naturally) helps a bit as well,” said Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com.

Last month, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to investigate the nation's imports of copper to address the threat to national security and economic stability. “The United States faces significant vulnerabilities in the copper supply chain, with increasing reliance on foreign sources for mined, smelted, and refined copper,” stated the White House. The order is considered a precursor to copper's import duties, competing with China's dominance in the metal supply chain, which triggered a spike in copper prices.

Copper futures prices jumped about 12% since the announcement as traders were paying higher premiums on speculation that the US would impose tariffs on the base metal imports. Suppliers also rushed shipments to America ahead of potential import duties, reducing volumes elsewhere. Trump's ambition to bring production back to the US may lead to higher manufacturing costs, in turn, elevating inflation.

At the government annual meeting, China set its gross domestic product (GDP) growth target at 5% and raised its deficit level to a three-decade high, followed by further stimulus measures to bolster its economy. 

Earlier this month, China's state news agency, Xinhua, reported that the government will “vigorously boost consumption” and “expand domestic demand in all directions.” The plan includes measures to support domestic spending, raise household income, and childcare subsidies.

Furthermore, the country's retail sales rose 4% in the first two months, the fastest pace since October last year. Additionally, both industrial output and fixed-asset investment grew more than estimates in February.

China is the world's largest copper supplier and consumer, as well as a key player in driving global green energy transitions. These announcements, alongside positive economic data last week, further added to copper price's upside momentum, with copper futures price up 4.4% last week, extending a three-week gaining streak.

The US dollar weakened against the other major currencies in the G-10 group since mid-January, with the dollar index down 4% this year. A widening global trade war sparked risk-off sentiment, leading to selloffs in the US stock markets and a decline in the US dollar. In the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting last week, the bank expected slower economic growth and higher inflation. A weakened greenback tends to push up commodity prices, as most are priced in the US dollar, although it is the primary reason for copper's rally.

        The first flight carrying 199 migrants from Venezuela from the US landed on Monday.
    

A flight carrying 199 Venezuelan migrants landed Maiquetía early on Monday, the country's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello told state-run Venezuelan TV. 

The group arrived on plane from Honduras after they were deported from the US. 

""199 compatriots, 199 Venezuelan colleagues returning to their homeland,"" were on board, Cabello told VTV.

The flight is the first since Venezuelan and US officials struck a deal to resume repatriation flights on Saturday, following a two-week long stand off after Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro suspended flights. 

Maduro refused to receive flights from the US carrying deported migrants after US President Donald Trump announced he would withdraw Chevron's license to export Venezuelan oil.

The Venezuelan leader said the decision ""affected"" flights to Venezuela, prompting members of the Trump administration to threaten further sanctions on the country. 

Venezuelan officials confirmed on Saturday that a deal between the pair had been reached. 

""We have agreed with the US government to resume the repatriation of Venezuelan migrants with an initial flight tomorrow, Sunday, March 23,"" Jorge Rodríguez, the president of Venezuela's Assembly, posted on social media. 

In his statement, Rodríguez also referred to the deportation by the Trump administration of some 250 Venezuelans to a high-security prison in El Salvador.

Trump has accused, without providing evidence, those migrants of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang — a designated US foreign terrorist organisation. 

“Migrating is not a crime and we will not rest until we achieve the return of all those who require it and until we rescue our brothers kidnapped in El Salvador,” Rodríguez said.

The Venezuelan leader also said that he held the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, responsible for the well-being of the Venezuelans deported to that country.

""You guarantee their health and, sooner rather than later, you have to hand them over and release them, because they are kidnapped,"" Maduro said.

        The discovery follows the detention of a Bulgarian woman accused of spying for the Kremlin in December.
    

The Kremlin deployed a disinformation campaign targeting Ukraine and sparking pro-Russian sentiment across German-speaking countries, Austrian authorities revealed on Monday.

The investigation showed that a cell working for Russian intelligence was set up shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. 

It intended to influence public opinion against Ukraine and its President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, both online and on the ground mostly in Austria, by using far-right and nationalist stickers and graffiti, which it claimed pro-Ukrainian activists were behind.  

""The direct goal of this disinformation cell was to use targeted actions in the context of the war to negatively influence public opinion against Ukraine ... thereby generating – at a higher level – pro-Russian sentiment,"" a statement from Austria's domestic intelligence agency said. 

The agency said it discovered the operation as it analysed devices belonging to a Bulgarian citizen detained in December on suspicion of spying for the Kremlin. 

The woman, who has not been named so far, is suspected of playing a ""significant"" role in the campaign: distributing content in both Germany and Austria and acting as a contact for Russian intelligence for accomplices in Russia and the UK.

She has admitted to working for the cell and has been released on bail, according to Austria's Press Agency.

Italian and Scottish researchers claim they found a major discovery beneath the Pyramids of Giza, potentially rewriting the history of ancient Egypt. Using radar technology, the team led by Corrado Malanga from Italy's University of Pisa and Filippo Biondi from the University of Strathclyde in Scotland announced the findings of what they describe as a vast underground city stretching more than 6,500 feet directly beneath the pyramids.""This groundbreaking study has redefined the boundaries of satellite data analysis and archaeological exploration,"" said the project's spokesperson, Nicole Ciccolo, according to The Sun. She elaborated that the discovery ""could redefine our understanding of the sacred topography of ancient Egypt, providing spatial coordinates for previously unknown and unexplored subterranean structures.""  The researchers used a new radar technology known as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which combines satellite radar data with tiny vibrations from naturally occurring seismic movements. This method creates 3D images of what lies beneath the Earth's surface without the need for physical excavation. Their study, still awaiting peer review, suggests that the complex is ten times larger than the pyramids themselves.The team claims to have discovered eight vertical cylinder-shaped structures, referred to as shafts, extending approximately 2,100 feet deep beneath the pyramids. Each shaft is said to be surrounded by spiral pathways that connect to two 80-meter cube-shaped structures. Above these, they reportedly found five multi-level structures connected by passageways. Advertisement""The existence of vast chambers beneath the earth's surface, comparable in size to the pyramids themselves, has a remarkably strong correlation with the legendary Halls of Amenti,"" Ciccolo stated. She explained that the cylindrical structures were found underneath each of the three pyramids and appear ""to serve as access points to this underground system.""Several experts have expressed skepticism regarding these claims. Independent experts, including Professor Lawrence Conyers, have raised serious concerns about the study. ""I could not tell if the technology used actually picked up hidden structures below the pyramid,"" Conyers told Daily Mail, calling the claims of a vast city underneath the pyramids ""a huge exaggeration."" He acknowledged that while small structures such as shafts and chambers might exist beneath the pyramids, the idea of a vast underground city is questionable. ""The Mayans and other people in ancient Mesoamerica often built pyramids on top of the entrances of caves or caverns that had ceremonial meaning to them,"" he explained, according to The Sun. ""It is conceivable there are small structures, such as shafts and chambers, beneath the pyramids that existed before they were built because the site was special to ancient people.""Critics point out that SAR technology typically excels at detecting shallower features, and its effectiveness diminishes significantly beyond a few meters in solid geological formations.    Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Despite the skepticism, the findings have sparked excitement online. Posts on social media platform X have fueled speculation, with some users suggesting that the structures could support alternative theories about the pyramids functioning as ancient energy systems rather than burial sites—a notion supported by figures such as Nikola Tesla and Christopher Dunn. Advertisement""The megastructure they just found underneath the Giza Pyramids is probably the most important discovery to ever be made in our lifetimes,"" one user posted, according to Marca. Others have shared similar sentiments, blending hard science with speculative theories.The researchers hope to continue their research but acknowledges that securing approval from the authorities to excavate the area is incredibly tough. ""Despite the skepticism, the only way to prove the discoveries are true is through targeted excavations,"" Conyers added, according to Daily Mail.  The Giza complex, consisting of the pyramids Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, built about 4,500 years ago on a rocky plateau on the west bank of the Nile River in northern Egypt, has long been a subject of intrigue and speculation. Traditionally believed to be royal tombs, these new claims, if substantiated, could potentially challenge the widely accepted understanding of their purpose.While the idea of a hidden underground city is tantalizing, the current evidence remains unverified. Until more concrete data—such as peer-reviewed papers or excavation results—emerges, the scientific community urges caution. The Egyptian government, historically cautious about excavations that challenge established narratives, has not commented on the claims.Egyptian archaeologist Dr. Zahi Hawass vehemently denied the existence of columns beneath the tomb of King Khafre, calling such claims ""baseless"" and lacking any scientific evidence. ""The rumors that have spread about the Egyptian pyramids that there are columns under King Khafre's pyramid have no basis in truth, and there is no scientific evidence to support this claim, and there are no missions working in King Khafre's pyramid now,"" Hawass stated on his official Facebook page, according to Sabq. He emphasized that the Supreme Council of Antiquities has not granted any permits for work inside King Khafre's pyramid.""No radar devices or modern technologies have been used to detect alleged structures beneath the Khafre Pyramid,"" pointed out Hawass, the former Minister of Antiquities, as reported by Asharq Al-Awsat. He described the claims as ""an attempt to undermine ancient Egyptian civilization,"" adding that ""these are failed attempts, and these rumors will go to the dustbin of history,"" according to Al Arabiya.The claims made by Malanga and Biondi “fall within the realm of exaggeration and deception,"" said Dr. Hussein Abdel-Basir, Director of the Antiquities Museum at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, according to Asharq Al-Awsat. He stressed that ""any real scientific discovery in the field of archaeology must be published first in a reliable scientific journal after careful review by independent experts.""Abdel-Basir pointed out that “geophysical techniques, such as Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) or seismic analysis, can scan limited depths, not exceeding tens of meters at best.""The details they announced could not have been detected using such methods,"" remarked Hawass, according to Al-Ahram. The article was written with the assistance of a news analysis system.

Israel defeated Estonia 2-1 over the weekend to kick off its 2026 World Cup campaign on the right foot.The blue-and-white conceded an early goal but equalized soon after, with captain Eli Dasa scoring the winner in the 75th minute to secure all three points for Ran Ben Shimon's squad.  With the home game played at Debrecen's Nagyerdei Stadion due to the ongoing security situation in Israel, the visitors struck first as Maksim Pakotsi scored off a dead-ball play in the 10th minute to give Estonia a quick 1-0 lead.

I wanted to make sure no one here was complacent about games where, on paper, we are the favorites.”  The defender also looked ahead to Israel's next test against Norway.“Just as many thought Estonia would be an easy game and that we'd take three points and enjoy ourselves, the same is true for Norway. They are an excellent team, and this will be a completely different kind of match. Now, it's time to recover and prepare.”Solomon reflected on assisting Dasa's goal and the upcoming challenge.“Eli made a great move to score, and we talked about the possibility at halftime. I'm the happiest person in the world that he scored, but the most important thing is that we won – it was tough but incredibly sweet. We started the game well but missed a chance and then conceded, which took away some of our confidence. After we made it 1-1, I knew in my heart that we would win.“We will now analyze the game, recover, and start preparing for Norway, which will be a completely different match against some of the best players in the world. We will be ready.”

There is a point of optimism as US President Donald Trump embarks on his second term in office: His administration has clearly distinguished between the Islamic Republic regime and the Iranian people.Gradually, the world has begun to recognize that the brutal, occupying regime of corrupt, bloodthirsty, and anti-civilization clerics is fundamentally distinct from the noble, intelligent, and dignified people of Iran.  American media have started to realize the absurdity and offensive nature of referring to Iran's delusional dictator, Ali Khamenei, with the title “ayatollah” – which ironically means “sign from God.” This grotesque title, created by the regime's propaganda machine and uncritically adopted by global media, only serves to insult the intelligence of humanity.Slowly, European outlets are coming to understand that the mullahs' accursed doctrine offers nothing but terrorism, treachery, and murder. From this damned ideology of Khomeinism, no democracy, human rights, or progress shall ever emerge.

Even in the White House, no one was ever serious about regime change in Tehran. There was neither the will nor even the thought of it. To this day, they are ready to talk about everything in the solar system and the Milky Way – except the idea of dismantling the Islamic Republic or regime change in Iran. But at last, this necessity has become undeniable. Perhaps this time, Trump is resolved to rid the world of this malignant tumor.  A second US aircraft carrier has been deployed to the Middle East. The potential for a US military strike against the Islamic Republic's infrastructure is profound. Although no one desires war, America's long-overdue mission to end terrorism must now be completed. So long as this regime survives, Islamic terrorism will continue to claim lives across the globe.The prospect of an imminent US military operation targeting Ali Khamenei personally is serious and growing. Yet Khamenei, enamored with his own voice and obsessed with self-importance, continues to spew nonsense from behind his podium – rhetoric no different from the final ravings of Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi.The Iranian people do not take him seriously. Thousands of videos circulate online daily, praying for his dreadful demise. His threats of retaliation are empty. His only recourse lies in activating dormant terrorist cells within the US and Europe.Tehran's dictator refuses to accept Trump's conditions in the letter. Why? Because he is a deceitful, criminal Shi'ite cleric whose very identity depends on nuclear weapons development, arms exports to Islamic terror mafias, regional arson, and hatred toward Israel and the United States. Should he concede, everything would unravel.

Riyadh has hosted a new round of talks between the US and Ukraine. The talks were “productive and focused,” Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on Sunday, according to a report in Arab News.“We have concluded our meeting with the American team. We addressed key points, including energy,” he said, adding that the goal was a “just and lasting peace.”  Saudi Arabia first hosted the talks between the US and Kyiv in the wake of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to the White House on February 28. When that meeting did not go as planned and appeared to lead to a potential crisis in US-Ukraine relations, Riyadh stepped in as a potential place for negotiations.The Associated Press noted on March 10 that “Saudi Arabia, under its assertive Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been positioning itself as an ideal location for possible peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow – and even the first face-to-face talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump.” Advertisement Ukrainian Head of Presidential Office Andriy Yermak speaks to Reuters in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, March 11, 2025. (credit: REUTERS/MOHAMMED BENMANSOUR)The round of talks took place in Jeddah. This followed US-Russia talks that had taken place in Riyadh on February 18. Saudi Arabia has said it hoped for “a lasting peace to end the Ukrainian crisis.”During the first round of talks, the Ukrainian delegation included Zelensky's Chief of Staff, Andriy Yermak, as well as Foreign Affairs Minister Andrii Sybiha and Umerov. The new round of negotiations took place on Sunday, March 23. “The meeting, which preceded talks on Monday between the US and Russian delegations, came as US special envoy Steve Witkoff expressed optimism about the chances for ending Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II,” Arab News wrote.“I feel that (Putin) wants peace,” Witkoff told Fox News.

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  “I think that you're going to see some real progress in Saudi Arabia on Monday, particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries. And from that, you'll naturally gravitate into a full-on shooting ceasefire.” AdvertisementThe reports at Arab News also say that a Russian delegation is arriving in Saudi Arabia on March 24.Moscow has said that “difficult negotiations” lie ahead. “We are only at the beginning of this path,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The Russians don't seem ready for a ceasefire. Instead, Moscow is focusing on a potential Black Sea grain deal.However, Peskov said that the opportunity for “mutually beneficial cooperation in a wide variety of spheres between our countries cannot be overstated.”  Russia and Ukraine's growing reliance on drone warfareThe fighting continues in Ukraine, and so do the talks. Reports said that Moscow had launched 147 drones at Ukraine in the last day and that Russia had also intercepted 60 Ukrainian drones. Both countries now increasingly rely on drones, rather than manned aircraft, to do the fighting in the skies.Ukraine has accused Moscow of dragging out the talks. “No matter what we talk about with our partners, we need to push Putin to give a real order to stop the strikes: The one who brought this war must take it away,” Zelensky said, according to Arab News.Saudi Arabia continues to position itself as a key player in the talks. This is a new and important role for Riyadh to play. This will give the kingdom more influence with the Trump administration.It could also influence Saudi Arabia's role both in the region and globally. Riyadh may be more willing to take on difficult challenges in the region, such as doing more outreach to the new Syrian government regarding financial support for reconstruction. It could also lead to more Saudi engagement regarding plans for Gaza.

US Vice President JD Vance lambasted Denmark for not being a “good ally” amid POTUS Donald Trump's desire to buy the island. 

In an interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday morning, Vance was asked to share his thoughts if the United States could purchase Greenland. He responded, “I think it's possible, Maria.”

“Here's the thing which I think a lot of folks don't appreciate about Greenland. It's really important to our national security,” Vance claimed.

The US Vice President clarified that the Russians and Chinese use “sea lanes” that encircle Greenland, the largest island in the world. He slammed the Danish government by accusing it of “not doing its job” and “not being a good ally” by limiting US access.

Vance said that gaining “more territorial interest in Greenland” was the only practical way to address the national security problem.

“That is what President Trump is going to do because he doesn't care what the Europeans scream at us; he cares about putting the interests of American citizens first,” he said, emphasizing that the President will seize the island if necessary.

In a Truth Social post in January, Trump declared that “the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,” garnering massive flak from the island.

Greenland Prime Minister Mute B. Egede blasted the Trump administration for adopting a “highly aggressive” strategy after a group of top US officials visited the region last week.

During the interview, Vance went on to claim that people of Greenland “were not actually happy with [the] Danish government.” In contrast to his assertion, 85 percent of Greenlanders opposed the idea of becoming a US territory, according to The Guardian report.

Vance further asserted that Greenland was “an incredibly bountiful country,” underscoring the US' ambition to obtain the island's abundant natural riches.

According to a White House press release, Second Lady Usha Vance and her son will arrive in Greenland on Thursday. They will “visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenlands' national dogsled race.”

Mike Waltz, Trump's security advisor, is also traveling to the island with US Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

Meanwhile, Denmark PM too targetted Trump administration over recent Greenland visit by US officials. 

In a statement,  Mette Frederiksen said that “visit from the United States cannot be seen in isolation from the public statements that have been made. This is something we take seriously.”

Tiger Woods has confirmed that he is dating Donald Trump's former daughter-in-law, Vanessa Trump. Tiger took to social media to share photos of the two of them. While one photo shows them standing side by side, another shows them lying together.

Tiger captioned the photos of X, “Love is in the air and life is better with you by my side! We look forward to our journey through life together. At this time we would appreciate privacy for all those close to our hearts.”

Tiger Woods known for keeping personal life privateVanessa was married to Donald Trump Jr from 2005 to 2018, and share five children together, including 17-year-old Kai. Tiger confirmed their relationship after the two were featured in various gossip outlets over the past few weeks. Many had assumed that Tiger and Vanessa are in a relationship, only for Tiger to confirm it now. Tiger's post may come as a surprise to some, considering he generally keeps his personal life extremely private. The post is similar to the 2013 announcement that he and Lindsey Vonn made on social media, confirming they were dating. Tiger said back at the time that Lindsey “wanted to limit the ‘stalkarazzi' and all those sleazy websites that are out there following us” as it could lead to dangerous situations involving his children. Vanessa married Trump Jr at the Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. She filed for an uncontested divorce in New York in March 2018. The divorce was settled by the end of 2018. Trump Jr, on the other hand, split from Kimberly Guilfoyle and is now reportedly dating Bettina Anderson. Amid reports of separation, Trump Jr said he and Guilfoyle will “never stop caring for each other” and will “always keep a special bond.” “Since the very beginning, no one on Team Trump has worked harder than Kimberly to help elect and reelect my father — and no one deserves this ambassadorship more than she does,” he said in December last year.

Greenland Prime Minister has taken aim at the Trump administration after finding out that a group of high-ranking officials will be arriving at the island before Second Lady Usha Vance's cordial visit.

On Sunday, the Trump administration propagated Vance's three-day trip to Greenland, announcing that she will be accompanied by her son from Thursday to Saturday to tour historical and cultural landmarks and witness the yearly dogsled race.

However, little was known about a visit led by national security advisor Mike Waltz that is supposedly planned for earlier this week.

Meanwhile, Mute B. Egede, the PM of Greenland, expressed his anger and indignation in a message to the local media after learning of the consecutive trips to the island.

“We are now at a level where it can in no way be characterized as a harmless visit from a politician's wife,” Egede asserted, as per Greenland's Sermitsiaq newspaper.

He went on to ask why the US national security adviser is in Greenland. According to him, the sole intent of his visit is to show off authority over Greenland amidst Trump's plans to take over it.

Calling him Trump's closest and most trusted advisor, the PM said that “his presence in Greenland alone will certainly make the Americans believe in Trump's mission, and the pressure will increase after the visit.”

Regarding the forthcoming travels of US officials in Greenland, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also released a statement.

“The visit from the United States cannot be seen in isolation from the public statements that have been made,” he said. “This is something we take seriously.”

Amidst his father's interest in buying the island, Trump Jr. visited Greenland in early January for a short visit.

Reflecting on his journey, he described it as a “incredible experience.” In a video shared on X, he claimed, “By the way, they love America here. They love America. They love Trump.”

The US is permitted to run military installations in Greenland, such as Ptiuffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Base, under a long-standing defense pact with Denmark.

After World War II, the United States made an offer to buy the island, but the Danish government turned it down.

According to both the Greenlandic and Danish governments, the region is not for sale.

Actor Dia Mirza has reacted after the CBI filed closure reports related to the death of Sushant Singh Rajput. Taking to her Instagram Stories, Dia questioned if the media ""will have the grace"" to apologise to Rhea Chakraborty and her family. The CBI filed two separate reports--in the abetment to suicide case filed by Sushant father and another by his rumoured girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty against his sisters, as per news agency PTI. (Also Read | Rhea Chakraborty's lawyer reveals he defended the family pro bono in Sushant Singh Rajput case despite threats)

Dia Mirza added that the media caused “deep anguish and harassment” to Rhea. ""Who in the media will have the grace to put out a written apology to Rhea Chakraborty and her family? You went on a witch hunt. You caused deep anguish and harassment just for TRPs. Apologise. That's the very least you can do. @rhea chakraborty (red rose emoji),"" wrote Dia. The courts will now decide whether to accept the report or order a further probe by the agency, as per PTI.

What happened to SushantSushant was found hanging from the ceiling of his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14, 2020. He was 34. His postmortem conducted at Cooper Hospital had concluded that the actor died due to asphyxia. More about the casesThe CBI investigated the two separate cases -- filed by KK Singh with Patna Police accusing Rhea of abetment to suicide and siphoning off ₹15 crore from the actor's accounts. The second was filed by Rhea in Bandra, accusing Sushant's sisters of giving medicines to him on the basis of a bogus prescription issued by a Delhi doctor. In the case filed before Bandra Police, which the CBI later took over, Rhea had alleged that Sushant died five days after these medicines were wrongly prescribed to him. Based on expert opinion, crime scene analysis, witness statements and forensic reports, the CBI concluded there was no material to support the allegations that anyone could have driven the actor to suicide, PTI reported, citing officials. The agency finally decided to file its final reports bringing to rest five years of conspiracy theories surrounding the death of the actor, they said. In its reported medico-legal opinion to the CBI, forensic specialists at AIIMS had dismissed the claims of ""poisoning and strangling"" made in the case of Rajput's death.

For Rohit Boda, Group Managing Director of J.B. Boda Group, fitness has been more than just a personal pursuit - it has been a journey of discipline and challenges. His remarkable transformation – from weighing 104 kg at his heaviest to dropping 30 kg – is a testament to his relentless commitment to health. But perhaps more inspiring is how he methodically rebuilt his body to a strong and sustainable 74 kg, proving that fitness is a lifelong journey, not a one-time goal.

Rohit's fitness journey began more than 14 years ago when he weighed 104kg. Like many young professionals, balancing career ambitions with health was a challenge.

However, instead of seeking quick fixes, he approached fitness with discipline and consistency to shed weight properly. His transformation was so extreme that he dropped 30 kg.

 

A post shared by Rohit Boda (@rohitboda)

Rather than letting setbacks define him, Rohit recalibrated his fitness journey. He strategically lost weight to a healthy 74 kg by focusing on strength training, mindful nutrition, and overall wellness. Unlike crash diets or unsustainable routines, his approach was rooted in sustainability.

He focused on building strength and overall physical fitness while maintaining a disciplined and sustainable approach to health.

Rohit Boda is the Group Managing Director of JB Boda Group, an Indian company specialising in insurance and reinsurance broking services. Besides looking after his family business, he is also the founder of RB Ventures, Dubai.

In one LinkedIn post, Boda described himself as a formerly “obese human” who found his passion for fitness.

“My passion for fitness began when I lost around 27 kgs after being an obese human around 12 years back during my college days and then an idea was struck a few years later to convert my 'passion to profession',” he wrote, talking about his initiative SquatUp, aimed at promoting community-driven wellness.

Boda says his weight loss journey, while challenging, has also been full of fun. He aims to bring the same passion to his entrepreneurial ventures.

“From 104 kgs 14 years back to 78 kgs today, this is a journey that I have enjoyed the most,” he wrote in a LinkedIn post one year ago. “The same way, I have taken pride in launching 'Squat Up' in 2017 followed by 'RB Ventures' in 2023.

President Donald Trump on Sunday complained about a ‘distorted' portrait of him at the Colorado State Capitol. The 78-year-old blamed Governor Jared Polis, even though the Democrat had nothing to do with the photo. It was a Republican state senator Kevin Grantham, who raised funds to get the painting up in 2019.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: “Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor, along with all other Presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before.”

He further called on Gov Polis ‘to take it down', adding that the Democrat ‘should be ashamed of himself!'

President Trump did not stop there. He complained about the artist, who also did former President Barack Obama's portrait at the Capitol.

""The artist also did President Obama, and he looks wonderful, but the one on me is truly the worst. She must have lost her talent as she got older. In any event, I would much prefer not having a picture than having this one, but many people from Colorado have called and written to complain.""

“In fact, they are actually angry about it! I am speaking on their behalf to the Radical Left Governor, Jared Polis, who is extremely weak on Crime, in particular with respect to Tren de Aragua, which practically took over Aurora (Don't worry, we saved it!), to take it down. Jared should be ashamed of himself!"" the president added.

Jaat trailer: The trailer of Gopichand Malineni's maiden Hindi film Jaat, starring Sunny Deol and Randeep Hooda in the lead roles, was released on Monday. The trailer shows Sunny's titular character threatening to bring down Randeep's ‘lanka' while saving the day. (Also Read: Jaat: Sunny Deol holds massive fan in bizarre first look of his next; internet jokes about being ‘blown away')

The almost 3-minute-long trailer sets up the world of Jaat. We're introduced to ‘Ranatunga ki Lanka' – a downtrodden place Randeep runs with everyone fearful to stand up to him. Numerous bodies are found buried in a field and Saiyami Kher's police officer is told Ranatunga is the reason for it. Regena Cassandrra's character says that even God is scared of entering the place.

But soon, Sunny's titular character steps up to save the day. It's hinted that he was once in prison for something, and Upendra Limaye describes him as an ‘atom bomb'. The trailer ends with him saying, “Ye dhai kilo ke haath ki taakat pura north dekh chuka hain. Ab south dekhega. (The north has already seen the power of this two-and-half-kilo arm. Now, the south will see it)”

Internet reactsReactions to the trailer ranged from people liking it to others wondering if the script was originally meant for Balakrishna. One person wrote on Reddit, “They had in the first half not gonna lie.” Another wrote, “Mass BGM, Dialogue Baazi, film looks like a winner. This is how to cut a trailer.” A Redditor wondered, “Looks like Balakrishna wasn't available, so director went with Sunny.” One person even thought that ‘Thaman cooked'. A person on X (formerly Twitter) compared it to Sikandar trailer, writing, “What We Expected From #SikandarTrailer Is Delivered By #JaatTrailer. This Trailer Is Just Mass, Mass & Mass.”

Donald Trump has taken to Truth Social to express his thoughts on a 60 Minutes segment with George Clooney. He criticised the actor for his political views, which he had done in the past too.

“Why would the now highly discredited 60 Minutes be doing a total “puff piece” on George Clooney, a second rate movie “star,” and failed political pundit,” the president wrote. “He fought hard for Sleepy Joe's election and then, right after the Debate, dumped him like a dog.”

Trump added, “Later, I assume under orders from the Obama camp, pushed all out for “Kamala,” only to soon realize that that was not going to work out to well. 60 Minutes even fraudulently inserted Fake answers into her disastrous interview, aired just before Election Day, in one of the most embarrassing and dishonest events in broadcast history…And now George Clooney again? His press agent should be making a fortune!!!”

Clooney's interview explored his Broadway debut as part of the production and cast for the play ‘Good Night, and Good Luck.' The drama chronicles how journalist Edward R. Murrow fought to pursue the truth in a turbulent media landscape.

Clooney believes the parallels between the play and present realities are lucidly pointed. As examples, he also referred to Trump's settlement with ABC News and ongoing lawsuit with CBS.

“When the other three estates fail, when the judiciary and the executive and the legislative branches fail us, the fourth estate has to succeed,” Clooney said. “ABC has just settled a lawsuit with the Trump administration. And CBS News is in the process … We're seeing this idea of using government to scare or fine or use corporations—to make journalists smaller.”

“Governments don't like the freedom of the press. They never have,” the actor added. “And that goes for whether you are a conservative or a liberal or whatever side you're on. They don't like the press.”

Chinese military personnel stand on the deck of a landing ship during a naval parade.China's armed forces are more ready than ever to surround the self-ruled island of Taiwan, cut it off from the world and try to squeeze it into submission.

 A Chinese blockade of Taiwan would be an act of war that sparks a global crisis. It would provoke a military response by Taiwan, force President Trump to decide whether the U.S. military should help defend the island, disrupt global trade and impel European nations to impose punishing sanctions on Beijing.  But the Chinese military, empowered by a decadeslong buildup and ordered by leader Xi Jinping to rapidly modernize by 2027, already has demonstrated what it can do. In increasingly complex exercises, Chinese forces have encircled Taiwan and simulated blockades. The more that China prepares, the greater the risk that Beijing decides to shift without notice from drills to war. China claims Taiwan as its own territory and doesn't rule out the use of force to seize it. A blockade is one of Xi's most powerful military options—short of an invasion, a steep challenge for the not-yet-battle-tested Chinese military—to induce the island to surrender to Beijing's authority. China's military exercises provide clues about how Beijing would enforce a blockade. The Pentagon, military experts and monitoring by Taiwan fill out the picture of how it would take shape and the readiness of China's armed forces to carry it out. China has many options—recent tabletop wargames led by Taiwan's president investigated around a dozen versions of a blockade or similar action, according to people who took part—but all share common features. Here is how the U.S., Taiwan and independent experts suggest China's forces—from navy to civilian maritime militia—could work together to isolate Taiwan. China has displayed elements from the expanding arsenal of blockade tools at its disposal on a near-daily basis. A record 125 Chinese military aircraft, including jet fighters, helicopters and drones took part in large-scale air-and-sea drills in October that simulated a blockade of Taiwan, according to Taiwan's defense ministry. China's military described the event as combat-readiness drills, including for sea and land strikes and port blockades. China's defense ministry and its Taiwan Affairs Office didn't respond to questions about Beijing's plans. China has sizable means of striking Taiwan available: Its air force operates around 1,900 jet fighters and 500 bombers, while its rocket force has more than 3,000 missiles capable of reaching Taiwan, according to the Pentagon. Taiwan's Defense Ministry this week identified drone warfare in particular as an area of growing Chinese capacity and Taiwanese concern. In blockade scenarios drawn up by the U.S., Taiwan and others, when China's air assault begins, its navy—the world's largest, with more than 370 vessels at its disposal—is already in motion. The size of the fleet reflects a long growth spurt that hasn't ended. China is the world's top shipbuilder by a wide margin, and that includes warships for its growing navy. In 2000, the U.S. had more warships, but China surpassed the U.S. two decades later. China is projected to have 425 warships by 2030, outnumbering the U.S. fleet by more than one-third, according to the Congressional Research Service. While China's aircraft carriers are seen as less capable than their American counterparts, China is working to catch up. After adding its second carrier in 2019, China is expected to put a third into service this year. And in a fleet of 59 submarines, China's six nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines are all assigned to commands that would participate in a direct conflict with Taiwan's navy, according to the Pentagon. China's naval buildup also has enhanced its geographical reach. In December exercises, China deployed more than 90 naval ships and coast guard vessels accompanied by several thousand personnel, Taiwanese officials said. Vessels turned up around Taiwan, in the waters surrounding Japan and South Korea, and in the South China Sea. China's coast guard claimed in October for the first time to have fully encircled Taiwan—and marked the milestone by publishing a map that depicted its deployment in a heart-shaped formation around the island. Cyberwarfare is another area in which China has rapidly developed a capability that would be put to work in the event of a blockade. Almost every large-scale Chinese military drill around Taiwan has been accompanied by a surge in cyberattacks, according to Taiwan authorities, and a blockade would be no different. And in several recent incidents, the cutting of subsea fiber optic cables has highlighted the vulnerability of Taiwan's connection to the internet. A vulnerable TaiwanTaiwan relies on imports for 96% of its power, through foreign oil, coal and natural gas. A blockaded island would have to rely on stockpiled energy imports, submit to Beijing, or go dark. The island imports around 70% of its food supply, another security gap. With a blockade, China could probe Taiwan's defenses while trying to suffocate its economy and undermine its determination to resist. Short of a blockade, Beijing has the ability to implement a quarantine, in which Chinese law-enforcement agencies intercept ships that deliver life-sustaining imports to the island, while causing less disruption to China's own shipping lanes. A quarantine would likely start with the announcement by Beijing of new rules requiring inspections for ships entering Taiwan—possibly targeting only the largest port, Kaohsiung. A Taiwanese coast guard member keeps watch at a harbor.While Beijing could use its vast number of vessels to enforce a quarantine, it holds another cudgel: Shipping companies that don't comply could be barred from access to China. To tighten the screws on Taipei, Beijing could move to block gas shipments that transit through the South China Sea, where China has exercised control over contested territory. “I think there's general agreement both in the United States and Taiwan that if China wanted, it could quarantine or blockade Taiwan today,” said Bonny Lin, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Defending the islandConcerns about China turning drills around Taiwan into an actual attack have unnerved the island's government and military officials. Taiwan's military held a five-day drill ending Friday designed to immediately prepare for war, and a coming exercise will be based on the premise that China plans to invade in 2027—the year that Xi set as a goal for invasion readiness, in the view of some Western intelligence officials. Most military experts agree that China's armed forces aren't ready for an amphibious invasion across the 110-mile-wide Taiwan Strait. The seas are often rough and Taiwan's cliffs, mud flats and built-up coastlines make it hard for ships to land. Taiwan's antiship missile systems, some of them acquired from the U.S., also represent a deterrent. The U.S. president's stance on Taiwan likely plays the most crucial role in Beijing's calculation about whether to take action, said Huang Chung-ting, a Taipei-based defense analyst at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, a think tank backed by the Taiwanese military. The prospect of a U.S. military response remains a wild card. Trump's commitment to defending the island is uncertain, and his recent suspension of U.S. support for Ukraine caused a rupture with Europe, diminishing the threat of unity on sanctions. “Our worst nightmare scenario involving a blockade actually comes from American isolationism—where the U.S. decides to completely step away from Taiwan Strait issues,” said Huang. In the short term, a quarantine would be more likely than a blockade or invasion, according to Lin and her CSIS colleagues. Such a step would test the will of the U.S. and others to respond, while potentially allowing China to establish a new normal at sea.

Ukrainian and US officials held talks in Riyadh, resuming efforts to end Russia's full-scale invasion as President Donald Trump pushes for a ceasefire.

The discussion on Sunday in Saudi Arabia was “productive and focused,” and “addressed key points including energy,” Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on social media. US and Russian delegates are expected to hold separate talks on Monday.

White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said earlier Sunday that the latest talks among “technical teams” would focus on a potential Black Sea maritime ceasefire. He suggested that would lead into discussions about “the line of control, which is the actual front lines” of the conflict, which started when Kremlin forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

“That gets into the details of verification mechanisms, peace-keeping, freezing the lines where they are,” Waltz said Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation. “And then, of course, the broader and permanent peace” including security guarantees for Ukraine. 

Trump said Saturday that efforts to stop the war between Russia and Ukraine from escalating further are “under control.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that a meeting of his military cabinet in Kharkiv focused on the talks in Saudi Arabia.

Umerov attended that meeting, along with Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, Andrii Hnatov, the forces' chief of general staff, and top Zelenskiy aides. 

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state television that negotiators from Moscow will be ready to discuss nuances of resumption of the Black Sea initiative in Riyadh. 

As of 2024, Russia occupied an estimated 20% of Ukraine in the nation's east and southeast, including Crimea. About 3 million Ukrainians are estimated to be living under Russian occupation, with millions more displaced and many others — including children — deported to Russia.

The 37-year-old songwriter hit out at the 'ADHD Memes' account, which had uploaded a screenshot of an X post.

The text said: “I saw a TikTok about how excessive reading in childhood is a sign of dissociation and I can't stop thinking about it.”

In her response to the post, Grimes shared details about her own diagnosis.

“I have to say, there's this subculture of I guess “mental health” accounts that I actually think are like extreme infohazards,” she said.

Grimes further revealed that she was diagnosed with ADHD/autism this year and found out that she may be dyslexic, “which is why she can't spell without spellcheck.”

As she was unaware about her health during her childhood, the singer regretted the fact, saying that she would have worked on it and even taken medication for the conditions.

She went on to say that her “weird obsessions and motivations” would have probably been considered “pathological” at the time.

Grimes says her symptoms of ADHD were ‘worse'According to Grimes, “huge percentage” of Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnoses are linked to “screen addiction and dopaminergic burn out.” The Canadian-born singer stated that her symptoms of ADHD were “worse” when she “wasn't an avid reader.” “An ADHD account trying to pathologize one of the best things a child can do to help with ADHD (and also become an autodidact and knowledgeable person etc., etc) is so dark... I can't even begin,” she said. The singer's startling revelation coincides with her continuous conflict with Musk regarding the welfare of their kids. According to Grimes, she has “begged” SpaceX CEO and attempted legal measures to keep their kids out of the limelight and away from the White House, especially after her son X AE A-XII was spotted at CPAC and in the Oval Office.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk's attempt to balance a fork and two spoons on his fingertip and acing it has gone viral. The video of Musk's balancing act is reportedly from US President Donald Trump's exclusive Mar-a-Lago candlelight dinner, where guests paid $1 million per seat. In one of the videos, Trump sits a little further away while Musk concentrates on balancing the cutlery.

A user shared the video on Musk's X (formerly Twitter), calling it ""peak genius and dinner entertainment"". Musk replied with a comment describing the video: ""A fork and two spoons balanced on the tip of my finger.""

The user quickly commented, ""Wow, I heard you started auditing the number of Forks and Spoons at that dinner.""

An X user explained the trick that ""almost no one can do"". They called it a ""gravity"" defying act and said, ""The uniqueness of this trick is that Elon Musk moves his hand left and right, where in the other tricks, the spoon and fork are placed on the table stationary, either held by a tooth pick or an empty glass cup. Elon has defeated gravity!""

""Proof that Elon is an alien,"" remarked an X user.

In November last year, Musk humorously responded to an X user, when they shared that his X profile had been verified since 3,000 BC, saying ""I'm a time-travelling vampire alien!"" Joking about his looks, he added, ""Even though I'm 5000 years old, I think I look much younger.""



See, this proves that I'm a time-traveling vampire alien!Even though I'm 5000 years old, I think I look much younger. https://t.co/QNgQjaBAp9



This also led to a small conversation between two users. ""One of the things I love about him is that he's always himself. He doesn't ""pretend,"" like most people do...,"" said an X user.

The user who called Musk an alien replied: ""I agree! it's one of the things I admire about him.""

While some users described the balancing act as fun and praised Musk, others couldn't help but share varied remarks for a laugh.

""This showcases his curious, scientific mind through a playful act of physics and dexterity,"" wrote an X user.

The post comes after weeks of tabloid rumors about the couple.

Tiger Woods took the unusual step of confirming his romance with Donald Trump's former daughter-in-law on Sunday in a brief post on social media.

Golf superstar Woods -- renowned for jealously guarding his private life over the years -- confirmed in a post on X that he is dating Vanessa Trump, the ex-wife of Donald Trump Jr.

""Love is in the air and life is better with you by my side,"" Woods wrote in a caption above two photos of himself relaxing with Vanessa Trump.

""At this time we would appreciate privacy for all those close to our hearts.""

The post comes after weeks of tabloid rumors about the couple.

Vanessa Trump, who divorced Donald Trump Jr. in 2018 after a 13-year marriage, also posted a picture of her and Woods together on her Instagram account in what appeared to be a co-ordinated announcement.

Sunday's announcement would once have been unthinkable for Woods, who famously named his luxury yacht ""Privacy"".

Woods's private life was laid bare during the 2009 sex scandal that upended his career and led to the implosion of his six-year marriage to Elin Nordegren, the mother of his two children.

Nordegren and Woods separated amid revelations of the golf star's serial infidelity, with reports suggesting he had slept with as many as 120 women during his marriage.

Displeased would be an understatement to describe the way leaders in Greenland are feeling about the planned visit of the Second Lady of the United States, Usha Vance. In less than 24 hours since the high-profile visit was announced by Washington, there has been severe criticism across the semi-autonomous Danish territory that Donald Trump has threatened to annex for national security reasons.

Greenland's prime minister and the interim government has decided to boycott the visit.

The delegation, led by Usha Vance, will visit the US military base in Greenland. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright will be part of the delegation. The visit comes two months after President Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., went to Greenland for what was described as ""a private visit"".

The US delegation visit will be from Thursday, March 27 to Saturday, March 29, 2025.

Donald Trump has, on several occasions, repeated his stance that the US aims to ""buy Greenland"", almost suggesting that there are no other options left. He has not ruled out Washington's use of force to achieve this goal.

President Trump has said it is ""necessary"" to make Greenland, which is known to be rich in mineral resources, part of the US, citing national security reasons.

Greenland's outgoing prime minister, Mute Egede, has called the high-profile US visit ""a provocation"", and said that they are not welcome in the country. Stopping a visit to the US military base would not be possible due to treaty obligations, but the interim government will not be meeting the US delegation, he said.

""Until recently, we could trust the Americans, who were our allies and friends, and with whom we enjoyed working very closely, but that time is over,"" Greenland's prime minister said.

The Greenlandic government, Naalakkersuisut, is currently in a caretaker phase following a March 11 parliamentary election won by the Democrats, a pro-business party that favours a slow approach to independence from Denmark.

Jens-Frederik Nielsen, leader of the Democrats, called for political unity and strongly criticized the timing of the US delegation's visit. ""We must not be forced into a power game that we ourselves have not chosen to be a part of,"" Mr Nielsen said.

Ahead of her visit, Second Lady Usha Vance, shared a video via the US consulate in Greenland, in which she said her visit to Greenland is meant to ""celebrate the long history of mutual respect and cooperation between our nations"".

Amid mounting flak in Greenland, the White House has said that ""This is a visit to learn about Greenland, its culture, history, and people and to attend a dogsled race the United States is proud to sponsor, plain and simple.""

""The visit aims to build on partnerships that respects Greenland's self-determination and advances economic cooperation,"" White House spokesperson Brian Hughes said.

According to news agency Reuters, to prepare for the visit, Washington has already sent two US Hercules military transport planes, carrying security personnel and bulletproof vehicles. Denmark has also sent dozens of police personnel to Greenland's capital Nuuk to boost the delegation's security.

The US National Security Adviser and Energy Secretary plan to visit US' space base in Pituffik, which is located along the shortest route from Europe to North America, and is vital for ballistic missile warning systems.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said that the top US delegation announcing a visit is ""something we take very seriously"". She added that on matters of ""the fundamental rules of sovereignty"", Denmark expects the United States to respect Copenhagen and the government of Greenland.

Tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson, dubbed the ""anti-ageing millionaire"", has been accused of using nondisclosure agreements to silence employees at his startup Blueprint about his bizarre behaviour.

Under the agreement, the workers had to attest that they were okay with him wearing ""little and sometimes no clothing/no underwear"" and with hearing ""discussions of sexual activities, including erections"", according to a New York Times report, which was published last week, nearly a month after Mr Johnson accused the American newspaper of preparing to publish a ""hit piece"" about him.

The workers also had to agree that the 47-year-old's behaviour was not ""unwelcome, offensive, humiliating, hostile, triggering, unprofessional or abusive"", the report said.

Mr Johnson, however, said the opt-in agreement was ""fair to all concerned and is in everyone's best interest.""

The report said the Blueprint employment agreement with confidentiality terms was 20 pages long and included dozens of restrictions.



The 20-page agreement said the workers must keep confidential ""any nonpublic information regarding Bryan's home, office, personal effects in his home or office, any spaces rented or owned by Bryan, any vehicles/planes/automobiles/boats/other methods of transportation that are not publicly accessible, or areas of his home or such space that are not publicly accessible"".

Bryan Johnson frequently walked around with ""little clothing"" on and sometimes flirted with Blueprint's largely female staff, the news outlet, which interviewed 30 people, said. But because of the opt-in agreement, no one was able to complain.

He also made millions from selling his payments firm Braintree to PayPal in 2013, and started investing the amount in his anti-ageing experiments. He then divorced his wife, hired prostitutes and took drugs like acid, Ibogaine and DMT, the report said.

Bryan Johnson, whose ""Project Blueprint"" inspired the Netflix documentary ""Don't Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever"", said the New York Times ""tried to come"" for him but ""missed"".

""What was meant to be a takedown ended up reading like a profile piece,"" he posted on X on Friday, hours after the report was published.

""They spent a year digging, talked to 30 people, including former fired employees, propped up my ex as their star witness (who tried to extract $9 million from me and failed) And still came up empty. It was only by contorting and twisting facts to fit a narrative that they barely had enough to publish,"" he said as he ""thanked"" NYT for the coverage.

Last month, Mr Johnson also publicly responded to the ""fact-checking"" questions that were mailed to him by the NYT reporter before publishing the story.

Speaking about the opt-in agreement at Blueprint, he said, ""I post nudes on social media. I track my nighttime erections. My team openly discusses my semen health. We make dank memes. Rather than letting people walk in blind, we disclose this upfront, in writing, so there are no surprises.""

""This isn't coercion; it's transparency. This practice is fair to all concerned and is in everyone's best interest. If someone doesn't align with our culture, they are free to work elsewhere. No one is forced to sign anything. The opt-in agreement exists to ensure that people understand and consent to the environment. It eliminates ambiguity and prevents misunderstandings,"" he added.

Question:“My reporting shows that you have used confidentiality agreements extensively in your personal life and also at your businesses, with at least more than two dozen people over the last ten years. The agreements I have seen over the years have grown to be much longer and…

Mr Johnson, who reportedly spends $2 million every year to reverse his age, also said the confidentiality agreements are ""standard and normal"". 

""I would be surprised if you didn't sign one as a condition of employment at The New York Times. On a personal level, my life is under constant scrutiny. These agreements try to create clear boundaries and expectations, so that trust isn't left to chance,"" he said.

""Over time, our agreements have evolved, just like everything else I iterate & improve upon. The goal is precision. Clarity eliminates confusion. People know where they stand, and that's a win for everyone,"" Mr Johnson added.

US President Donald Trump is planning to impose a new wave of tariffs on most imports during the ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement on April 2, laying the groundwork for a potential escalation in global economic hostilities. The upcoming announcements would reportedly be focused on so-called""reciprocal tariffs"", which the American leader sees as retribution for taxes and other barriers from nations, including longtime US allies. 

""April 2nd is going to be liberation day for America. We've been ripped off by every country in the world, friend and foe,"" Trump said in the Oval Office Friday. It would bring in ""tens of billions,"" he added. 

The President also hinted there may be “flexibility” in his plan to impose blanket tariffs on most US trading partners.

“I don't change. But the word flexibility is an important word,” Trump said. “Sometimes it's flexibility. So there'll be flexibility, but basically it's reciprocal.” 

In what is seen as a potential relief for markets gripped by anxiety about an all-out tariff war, the coming wave of tariffs is poised to be more targeted than the barrage Trump has occasionally threatened, Bloomberg reported citing his aides and allies.

The report said the US President would announce widespread reciprocal tariffs on blocs or nations, excluding only some countries. The administration will not, however, plan separate, sectoral-specific tariffs to be unveiled at the same event, as Trump had once teased, officials said. 



During his first two months in office, Trump raised tariffs on nearly $800 billion in imports from China, Mexico and Canada, sending the stock market careening and raising the risks of a US recession while inviting retaliation against domestic industries by trade partners. Despite the blowback, the President's senior advisers are now publicly pledging to create a new tariff regime to impose new duties.

Per the Bloomberg report, Donald Trump is looking for immediate impact with his tariffs, planning announced rates that would take effect right away-- a measure that could further strain ties with allied nations and provoke at least some retaliation. 

""Only countries that don't have tariffs on the US, and with whom the US has a trade surplus, will not be tariffed under the reciprocal plan,"" an official said.

As with many policy processes under Trump, the situation remains fluid and no decision is final until the president announces it, the report said.

Trump officials have publicly acknowledged in recent days the list of target countries may not be universal, and that other existing tariffs, like on steel, may not necessarily be cumulative, which would substantially lower the tariff hit to those sectors.  It's already a retreat from the American leader's original plans for a global across-the-board tariff at a flat rate, which later morphed into his ""reciprocal"" proposal that would incorporate tariffs and non-tariff barriers. 

It's also not clear which countries Donald Trump will include under his more targeted approach. He has cited the European Union, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Canada, India and China as trade abusers when discussing the matter, an official said.

While narrower in scope, Trump's plan is still a much broader push than in his first term and will test the appetite of markets for uncertainty and a raft of import taxes. ""There will be big tariffs that will be going into effect, and the president will be announcing those himself,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that steel and aluminium tariffs may not necessarily add to the country-by-country rates. ""I will have a better sense as we get closer to April 2. So, they could be stacked,"" he told Fox Business last week.

In the same interview, he signalled that roughly 15 per cent of countries, that are the worst offenders, will be targeted by the President.

""It's 15 per cent of the countries, but it's a huge amount of our trading volume,"" he said, referring to it as the ""dirty 15"" and signalling they are the target. 

""And they have substantial tariffs, and as important as the tariff or some of these non-tariff barriers, where they have domestic content production, where they do testing on our - whether it's our food, our products, that bear no resemblance to safety or anything that we do to their products,"" he said. 

Trump sees tariffs as a key tool both to steer new investment to the US and to tap new sources of revenue, which he hopes to offset tax cuts Republicans are considering. 

""Tariffs will make America more competitive. They will incentivize investment into America,"" Stephen Miran, Trump's Council of Economic Advisers chairman, said in an interview, declining to detail the steps. 

The White House has also argued that trillions of dollars in pledged announcements by foreign countries and companies provide evidence Trump's plans are working. Miran told Fox Business last week that talks are ongoing ahead of the April 2 deadline. 

""I do think that it's perfectly reasonable to expect that we could raise trillions of dollars from tariffs over a 10-year budget window and like I said before, using those revenues to finance lower rates on American workers, on American businesses,"" he said.

Still, economists have questioned whether the tariffs would meaningfully impact the deficit, particularly considering the risk of inflation or an economic slowdown.

Yung Filly, a 29-year-old British rapper and YouTube star, is facing allegations of raping a tourist in Spain's Magaluf. According to Metro, a judge in Palma, the Majorcan capital, is investigating the alleged hotel sex attack. 

This isn't the first time Yung Filly has faced serious allegations. In Australia, he pleaded not guilty to eight charges related to the alleged rape of a woman in his hotel room during his tour last September. The charges include four counts of sexual penetration without consent, three counts of assault occasioning bodily harm, and one count of strangulation. 

Now, a British tourist has accused him of sexual assault at a hotel in Magaluf, following one of his performances at the popular holiday resort. The woman reported the incident to British police after returning from her holiday.

The alleged assault occurred after Filly performed at a beach club in Magaluf. The woman claims she met him there and later bumped into him at a nearby nightclub. She told police that the alleged rape happened after she had consensual sex with one of Yung Filly's friends in a hotel room. When she ended up alone with Filly, he allegedly assaulted her

British authorities then contacted the Spanish Civil Guard, who passed on the details to an investigating court in Palma.

The status of the woman's questioning by the judge in the ongoing criminal probe is currently unclear. However, a well-placed source revealed that the magistrate has reached out to Australian authorities through formal channels to facilitate the questioning of Yung Filly, under oath on behalf of the Spanish authorities. 

The Majorcan court probe is being conducted behind-closed-doors as is normal in Spain where only trials are held in public.

Filly, whose real name is Andres Felipe Valencia Barrientos, was spotted for the first time in five months on March 11, leaving court after being granted 48,500 pounds bail. When approached by reporters, he briefly commented, ""It's a lovely day,"" declining to elaborate on his situation.

Just days after the US accused China of testing 'dogfighting' satellites in low Earth orbit, Beijing has clapped back with a sharp rebuttal. A report from China's state-run Global Times dismissed the US allegations as a ""budget-driven"" tactic which was ""part of a broader effort to curb space advances by emerging powers"" and preserve the US dominance in the sector.

The report insisted that Beijing's space programme was for peaceful purposes, ""dedicated to advancing human space technology"".

General Michael Guetlein, vice chief of space operations of the US Space Force (USSF) claimed at a defence conference last week that the agency observed ""five different objects in space manoeuvring in and out and around each other in synchronicity and in control"".

Beijing said Mr Guetlein's narrative was an attempt to justify higher military spending and hype the ""China, Russia threat theory"" narrative.

""Following US President Trump's return to office, the new administration aimed to cut military spending. Against this backdrop, various branches of the US military were desperate for budget increases and sought to secure more funding by hyping up so-called ""threats"" from China, Russia, and others"".

The USSF stated that Mr Guetlein was referring to three Chinese Shiyan-24C experimental satellites and two Shijian-6 05A/B experimental space objects that had been seen carrying out complex manoeuvres in low Earth orbit.

""That's what we call dogfighting in space. They are practicing tactics, techniques and procedures to do on-orbit space operations from one satellite to another,"" said Mr Guetlein.

""This is the most complex and challenging strategic environment that we have seen in a long time, if not ever,"" Mr Guetlein highlighted, adding that the force needs ""capabilities to deter and, if necessary, defeat aggression"" to ""guarantee that the advantage is in our favour"" into the future.

""There used to be a capability gap between us and our near peers, mainly driven by the technological advancement of the United States that capability gap has significantly narrowed.""

Franco Caraballo was arrested while at a US immigration center for an appointment. Shirly Guardado was detained while at work. Camila Munoz was taken into custody on her way home from her honeymoon.

US President Donald Trump's hunt for migrants to expel from the country is sparing no one. And while the government claims only criminals are being targeted, many of those in the crosshairs tell a different story. 

At a checkpoint in Texas, immigration agents stopped an undocumented Mexican couple on their way to a Houston hospital for their 10-year-old daughter's cancer treatment. 

The family was deported, separating the parents from their children, five of whom are US citizens, rights group Texas Civil Rights Project said. 



""We had to decide between being separated from our children or being deported together,"" the children's mother told the rights group.

""Now we are in Mexico without access to the urgent medical care our daughter needs,"" she said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

According to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), the Trump administration detained 32,809 migrants in its first 50 days in office, almost half of whom were convicted criminals. 

Last weekend it deported more than 200 to a prison in El Salvador, invoking the rarely used 1798 Alien Enemies Act and accusing most of the deportees of belonging to the Venezuela-based Tren de Aragua gang. 

Not all who were deported appear to be gang members, however.

Franco Caraballo, a 26-year-old Venezuelan barber who has been in asylum proceedings since 2023, went to an appointment at the ICE office in Dallas, Texas, in February. 

He did not come out. 

""I haven't done anything, I'm a good person,"" he told his wife Johanny Sanchez over the phone. 

Caraballo told her that officers put him in a red uniform meant to identify migrants classified as ""dangerous."" 

Lacking resources in his absence, she has had to sleep in her car.

""My lawyer spoke with ICE and they told him that Franco was deported (to El Salvador), that he had no criminal record but that they suspect he was a member of Tren de Aragua because of his tattoos,"" Johanny Sanchez said. 

Caraballo, she said, has two tattoos: one of a clock showing his first daughter's birth time, and one of a rose. 

Venezuelan Mervin Yamarte, 29, was recognized by family members in Dallas in a video released by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele showing the arrival of deportees from the United States. 

Arrested a week earlier, Yamarte worked as a mechanic and played soccer with jersey number 99. That number, his family said, was tattooed on his hand. 

Jhon Chacin, a 35-year-old Venezuelan tattoo artist, formally surrendered upon his arrival at the border in October 2024, during former president Joe Biden's tenure. 

He was detained because of his tattoos. 

Now, the Trump administration has sent him to El Salvador, despite having presented no evidence against him, his sister Yuliana told AFP. 

Camila Munoz, a 26-year-old Peruvian, was stopped in February at an airport in Puerto Rico, a US territory, while returning to Wisconsin after her honeymoon. 

Although her visa had expired, she had already initiated residency procedures. Munoz is being held in Louisiana, according to her husband Bradley Bartell, who voted for Trump. 

""I'm still kind of in shock,"" he said. 

""I wouldn't say I have any regrets (voting for Trump), I think the regrets are with the system,"" he added. 

""I'd ask him to sort out the judicial system and fix the problem.""

For immigration lawyer David Rozas, who is advising Bartell, the current crackdown is ""the scariest"" of his 21-year career.

He described migrants as ""the backbone of this country,"" doing jobs no one else wants. 

""People feel extremely betrayed,"" Rozas said. ""And we are going to end up with a huge labor shortage unless something changes.""

Shirly Guardado, a 27-year-old Honduran, was at her job near Houston when immigration agents took her away. 

""She's not a criminal. She's my wife. She's the mother of my son,"" said Ayssac Correa, 25, a sergeant in the US Army.

""She's always done everything by the book,"" he added. ""She's always been a law-abiding citizen.""

Guardado entered the country undocumented a decade ago, but had begun the paperwork to get legal residency. 

In her absence, he has been caring for their 10-month-old son, who is ""not sleeping as well"" without his mother, Correa said.

He fears that his wife may be deported, and that securing her return could be a prolonged process.

""That's three to five years my son would not have his mom,"" he said.

US and Ukrainian officials met in Saudi Arabia on Sunday night for ""productive and focused"" talks on de-escalating the war with Russia, with Washington hoping for ""real progress"" even as Moscow --  whose delegation was set to hold its own separate discussions with the Americans on Monday-- warned of ""difficult negotiations"" ahead. 

The White House is reportedly pushing for a broad ceasefire in Russia's war in Ukraine by April 20 which this year is Easter in both the Western and Orthodox churches. However, according to a Bloomberg report, the timeline may slip given the wide gap that exists between Kyiv and Moscow's positions.

US President Donald Trump has been aiming for a quick resolution to the three-year-old war, for which US officials are holding separate talks with Russian and Ukrainian representatives in Riyadh for the first such parallel negotiations since the early weeks of Moscow's invasion. 

The negotiations were originally scheduled to take place simultaneously to enable shuttle diplomacy, but with both warring sides proposing different plans for a temporary truce, attacks have continued unabated. America is hoping that going back and forth between the delegations can pave the way to a breakthrough.

The meeting between the Ukrainian team, led by defence minister Rustem Umerov, and the Americans finished late Sunday night. ""The discussion was productive and focused -- we addressed key points including energy,"" Umerov said on social media, adding Ukraine was working to make its goal of a ""just and lasting peace"" a reality.

Ukraine had previously said proposals to protect energy facilities and critical infrastructure would be on the agenda.

In an evening address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that ""Russia is the only one who is dragging this war out"".

""No matter what we talk about with our partners, we need to push Putin to give a real order to stop the strikes: the one who brought this war must take it away,"" he said.

Zelensky also urged his country's allies to put fresh pressure on Russia. ""New decisions and new pressure on Moscow are needed to bring an end to these strikes and this war,"" he posted on social media on Sunday.

Discussions between the United States and Russia were set for Monday, with Russian state media reporting Moscow's delegation had arrived in Riyadh on Sunday. 

Amid this, American envoy Steve Witkoff voiced optimism that any agreement struck would pave the way to a ""full-on"" ceasefire.

""I think you're going to see in Saudi Arabia on Monday some real progress, particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries. And from that you'll naturally gravitate to a full-on shooting ceasefire,"" he told Fox News.

But the Kremlin on Sunday downplayed expectations of a rapid resolution, saying talks were just beginning. ""We are only at the beginning of this path,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state TV.

He said there were many outstanding questions over how a potential ceasefire might be implemented.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected a joint US-Ukrainian call for a full and immediate 30-day pause, proposing instead a halt in attacks only on energy facilities. ""There are difficult negotiations ahead,"" Peskov said in the interview, published on social media.

Moscow heads into the Saudi talks after a rapprochement with Washington under Trump that has boosted confidence in the Kremlin.

Peskov said on Sunday that the ""potential for mutually beneficial cooperation in a wide variety of spheres between our countries cannot be overstated"".

""We may disagree on some things but that does not mean we should deprive ourselves of mutual benefit,"" he added.

Moscow has said the ""main"" focus in its talks with the US would be a possible resumption of a 2022 Black Sea grain deal that ensured safe navigation for Ukrainian farm exports via the Black Sea. ""On Monday, we mainly intend to discuss President Putin's agreement to resume the so-called Black Sea initiative, and our negotiators will be ready to discuss the nuances around this problem,"" Peskov said.

Moscow pulled out of the deal -- brokered by Turkey and the United Nations -- in 2023, accusing the West of failing to uphold its commitments to ease sanctions on Russia's own exports of farm produce and fertilisers.

A senior Ukrainian official previously told news agency AFP that Kyiv would propose a broader ceasefire, covering attacks on energy facilities, infrastructure and naval strikes.

Both sides launched fresh drone attacks on the eve of the negotiations. Ukrainian officials said a Russian drone attack killed three civilians in Kyiv, including a five-year-old girl and her father.

Ukraine's air force said Russia launched 147 drones at the country in the latest barrage.

Russia meanwhile said it had repelled nearly 60 Ukrainian drones overnight. Officials said one man was killed in the southern Rostov region of Russia when his car was set alight by falling drone debris, and a woman was killed in the Belgorod border region, also by a drone attack.

Ukraine's army, meanwhile, said it had captured a small village in its eastern Lugansk region, a rare battlefield success for Kyiv's struggling forces. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

A Texas couple has been arrested for allegedly shooting the father of their teenage son's girlfriend following a dispute over the daughter's age, the People reported. 

Luther Madison II, 39, is accused of shooting his son's girlfriend's father with a gun allegedly handed to him by his wife, Angelica Madison, 39, during a dispute in Hockley on March 18.

According to Harris County Constable Mark Herman, the altercation began when the parents met to discuss keeping their children apart, as the victim's family believed their daughter was ""too young to be dating.""

The meeting took place at the Madisons' home in Hockley, located just under an hour from Houston. At some point, the discussion escalated into a verbal and physical confrontation in the street, Daily Mail reported. 



During the altercation, Angelica reportedly took a gun from her pocket and gave it to Luther, who then allegedly shot the victim in the chest. He is also accused of pointing the weapon at the victim's wife and threatening her.

Police responded to reports of gunfire and found the victim with a gunshot wound to the chest. He was airlifted to the hospital, but his current condition remains unknown.

Both Luther and Angelica Madison were arrested and booked into the Harris County Jail.

Luther faces two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, with his bond set at $100,000. Angelica has been charged with one count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, with a bond of $25,000.

The couple has since bonded out of jail and is scheduled to appear in court on May 20. It is unclear whether they have entered a plea.

South Korea's Constitutional Court struck down the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo on Monday, reinstating him as acting president -- a role he was given after the president was suspended for declaring martial law last year. Mr Han was impeached by lawmakers in December, just weeks after he took over as acting leader from President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was himself impeached over his short-lived suspension of civilian legal process.

Mr Han's impeachment was dismissed in a 7-1 vote by the court's eight justices. Two justices voted to reject the impeachment motion entirely, according to news agency Yonhap.

Prime Minister Han lasted less than two weeks in the post and was impeached and suspended on December 27 after clashing with the opposition-led parliament by refusing to appoint three more justices to the Constitutional Court.

Parliament impeached him over his alleged role in martial law, as well as his refusal to appoint more justices and back special counsel bills targetting Yoon and First Lady Kim Keon Hee.



Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok assumed the position of acting president while the cases of Mr Yoon and Mr Han were considered by the Constitutional Court.

Mr Han, 75, had served in leadership positions for more than three decades under five presidents, both conservative and liberal. In a country sharply divided by partisan rhetoric, he had been seen as a rare example of an official whose varied career transcended party lines.

Still, the opposition-led parliament accused him of not doing enough to thwart Yoon's decision to declare martial law, an accusation he denied.

Mr Han attended the only hearing in the case on February 19, where he denied any role in the martial law episode and called for the court to dismiss the impeachment.

The unexpected imposition of martial law on December 3 by President Yoon and the ensuing political upheaval sent shockwaves through Asia's fourth-largest economy and drew concerns from allies such as the United States who had seen Yoon as a key partner in efforts to counter China and North Korea.

The martial law in the end only lasted about six hours after lawmakers voted to reject the declaration, after defying efforts by police and the military to seal off parliament, hopping fences to avoid the security cordons.

Scientists have discovered a ""vast underground city"" running beneath the famed Egyptian pyramids in Giza. Using radar equipment, they created high-resolution photos of thousands of feet below the surface to find the legendary ""Halls of Amenti,"" according to a study. But several archaeological experts have denied the claims, calling them ""fake news.""

Filippo Biondi of the University of Strathclyde in Scotland and Corrado Malanga of the University of Pisa in Italy led the expedition, finding the second-largest pyramid on the Giza Plateau, which was aptly titled the Khafre Project.

The scientists believe the ""groundbreaking study has redefined the boundaries of satellite data analysis and archaeological exploration.""

The research has discovered eight distinct vertical cylinder-shaped artefacts that span more than 2,100 feet beneath the pyramids. It has also discovered various other unidentified structures 4,000 feet down, GB News reported.

Scientists claimed to have used Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology to detect five small, room-like structures inside the pyramid. The team further revealed that a sarcophagus in one building was incorrectly believed to be the Pharaoh's Tomb, The New York Post reported.

The 4,500-year-old wonder is believed to have hidden rooms and wells beneath it, and the recently found buildings are connected to underground corridors. Researchers claimed that the five structures were discovered in the centre of the pyramid.

The Great Pyramid, the Pyramid of Menkaure, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Great Sphinx are all part of the Giza pyramid complex. Every pyramid was constructed and named for an ancient civilization's ruler.

The Halls of Amenti feature the legendary Hall of Records, a secret chamber believed to be located beneath the Great Sphynx or the pyramid complex that holds data about the local ancient population.



But Zahi Hawass, Egypt's former minister of antiquities and a leading expert on the pyramids, flatly denied these discoveries. The techniques used were ""neither scientifically approved nor validated"", Mr Hawass said, calling all claims ""completely wrong"" and ""fake news.""

He emphasised the lack of evidence for such massive subterranean structures after decades of research using gravimetry, muon tomography, and traditional radar. ""The claim of using radar inside the pyramid is false,"" Mr Hawass told The National.

Radar specialist Professor Lawrence Conyers labelled the findings ""a huge exaggeration"" and explained that such equipment could not possibly produce photos of structures thousands of feet below the surface.

He did, however, add that since the location was once ""special to ancient people,"" it was possible that smaller constructions, like chambers, were constructed before the pyramids.

Ms Conyers emphasised the entrances of caves or caverns had ""ceremonial meaning"" to ""Mayans and other people in ancient Mesoamerica"" and often built pyramids on top of the entrances.

The results of the study still need to be examined by a team of independent professionals and scholars.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Turkey is witnessing the worst street unrest in more than a decade following the arrest of Istanbul's embattled mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, a potential opposition candidate in the upcoming Turkish presidential election against incumbent President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Defying the ban on gatherings, tens of thousands of people took to the streets across cities around Turkey over the weekend against Mr Imamoglu's arrest.

Addressing vast crowds of protesters who gathered outside Istanbul's City Hall for a fifth straight evening on Sunday, his wife, Dilek Kaya Imamoglu, warned the authorities they would face a reckoning. 

""He will defeat you!... you will lose!"" she shouted from the platform.

""The injustice Ekrem faced... it struck a chord with every conscience. Everyone found something of themselves and the injustices they faced in what was done to Ekrem,"" Ms Imamoglu said.

Erdogan's CHP opposition party has denounced his arrest as a ""political coup"", with his supporters claiming the charges against him were politicised and aimed at stopping him from running for president in three years.

""Whenever there's a strong opponent (to Erdogan), they are always jailed,"" said 29-year-old voter Ferhat, who declined to give his surname.

""There is a dictatorship in Turkey right now, nothing else. It's politics in name only,"" he told AFP near City Hall.

However, some are also joining the agitation saying the issue is bigger than Mr Imamoglu and represents wider struggles, including concerns with democracy, the economy, education, and healthcare systems, according to a report by Al Jazeera. 

Ayten Oktay, a 63-year-old pharmacist, said there was no going back. 

""Now the Turkish nation has woken up. The protests will definitely continue after this. We will defend our rights until the end,"" she said.

(Source: AFP)

Protests in Turkey started on Wednesday after the mayor was arrested in a pre-dawn raid by hundreds of police. His supporters gathered at Istanbul University on the same evening to decry the arrest. According to media reports, the agitation has continued since, spreading across the country. 

Mr Imamoglu was elected mayor of Istanbul in 2019 and triumphantly re-elected last year. By winning Turkey's largest city (nearly 16 million inhabitants) and business centre, the 53-year-old mayor has become Erdogan's number one opponent. 

Observers believe that it was the looming primary that triggered the move against Mr Imamoglu, widely seen as the only politician capable of challenging President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

(Source: AFP)

The mayor was charged with corruption, bribery and ""terrorism"" due to an electoral agreement between the CHP and a pro-Kurdish party the authorities accuse of having links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is designated a terrorist group by Ankara. 

According to a report by AFP, the pretrial detention order stated that ""Ekrem Imamoglu is being detained for establishing and leading a criminal organisation; accepting bribes; corruption; illegally recording personal data; and rigging tenders"".

The order went on to say that ""although there is a strong suspicion of guilt for the crime of supporting an armed terrorist organisation, it is not necessary at this stage"" to order his detention on these potential charges ""since it has already been decided to imprison him for financial crimes"".

Although the court decided against formalising his arrest in a separate ""terror"" probe, the interior ministry said he had been ""suspended from office"".

The powerful and popular opposition mayor was on Sunday stripped of his title and shipped off to Silivri prison on the megacity's western outskirts.

As the court process played out, the main opposition CHP party held a long-planned primary to elect Mr Imamoglu as its candidate in the 2028 presidential election.

Opening the ballot beyond its 1.7 million members to anyone who wanted to vote, they said in the end they had registered 15 million votes for Mr Imamoglu. ""Out of a total of 15 million votes, 13,211,000 (not-party members) are solidarity votes,"" they added.

(Source: AFP)

Mr Imamoglu has vowed to fight on despite being suspended as mayor and jailed. ""This is not a judicial procedure, it's a (political) execution without trial,"" he wrote on X in a message through his lawyers. 

""I stand tall and will keep my head high. Fear cannot stop the inevitable! One way or another, you will be defeated. You will be defeated by our just cause, our courage, our humility, and our warm smiles. My great nation, Do not be sad, do not be disheartened, and never lose hope. Together, we will erase this blow to our democracy, this dark stain, once and for all...I stand tall and will keep my head high. Everything will be much better.,"" he said in another post. 

I stand tall and will keep my head high. Fear cannot stop the inevitable!One way or another, you will be defeated. You will be defeated by our just cause, our courage, our humility, and our warm smiles.My great nation,Do not be sad, do not be disheartened, and never lose…

Mr Imamoglu was due to be named Sunday as the CHP's candidate for the next presidential election, scheduled for 2028, in a primary in which he is the only candidate. 

On Tuesday, just hours before his arrest, the cancellation of his degree had already placed an obstacle in his path, as the Turkish Constitution requires all presidential candidates to have a higher education degree.

In 2023, Mr Imamoglu was not fielded by his party in the presidential race over a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence for ""insulting"" members of Turkey's High Electoral Committee. His appeal is still pending. 

CHP decided to go ahead with its primary Sunday and called on all Turks, even those not registered with the party, to participate in the hope of turning this election into a referendum. Istanbul town hall said that 15 million people voted in the primary, with 13 million of them not being CHP members. 

Mr Imamoglu's arrest has sparked the country's largest demonstrations since the Gezi protests of 2013, which began in Istanbul over the demolition of a local park. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Istanbul on Friday and Saturday evenings, with large demonstrations in other cities, notably Ankara and Izmir.

In total, rallies took place in at least 55 of Turkey's 81 provinces, or more than two-thirds of the country, according to an AFP tally. 

Analysts say the protests, mostly led by young people, reflect grievances that extend far beyond Mr Imamoglu's arrest. Faced with these protests, Turkish authorities have asked X to close more than 700 accounts, the online platform said.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

A US-based biotech startup called Loyal has received key approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for what could be the world's first drug, aimed at increasing the life span of dogs. The regulator's Center for Veterinary Medicine has accepted the Reasonable Expectation of Effectiveness (RXE) section of its conditional approval application for LOY-002, paving the way for the commercial rollout of the pill, perhaps by next year, according to a report in The Times.

Headquartered in San Franciso, the company has also managed to raise an extra $22 million in the B-2 funding round from Valor Equity Partners and Collaborative Fund, among others -- taking total investment in Loyal to $150 million.

""Everything we do is in service of helping dogs live longer, healthier lives. These two milestones represent our ongoing commitment to that mission through years of diligence and hard work,"" said Loyal founder and CEO Celine Halioua.

""Proving efficacy is one of the most challenging parts of developing a novel drug. While we still have significant work to do, RXE increases the probability that dogs will soon have access to our longevity drugs.""

The company is one year into a multi-year trial, involving over 1,000 dogs to prove the long-term safety and efficacy of the pill. However, under an accelerated approval pathway, the FDA could allow the drug into the market, as soon as next year, once Loyal hits certain safety and manufacturing milestones.

As per Loyal, its pill mimics the metabolic benefits that come from ""caloric restriction"" or fasting -- long-established as a way to extend life. Notably, when the body operates on fewer calories, it metabolises fuel more efficiently.

“Everyone asks me, ‘Is this just Ozempic for dogs?' And the answer is no,"" Ms Halioua clarified.

Dogs have a higher metabolic rate compared to humans, which accelerates their ageing process. Their bodies work at a faster pace, leading to quicker wear and tear. The researchers associated with the study are hoping to develop a drug that addresses this problem.

While there have been significant advancements in veterinary medicine, these are relatively recent compared to human medicine. Subsequently, the lifespan of dogs has not increased at the same rate as human lifespans over the last few centuries.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — In the latest twist in South Korea's ongoing political crisis, the country's Constitutional Court reinstated Prime Minister Han Duck-soo as acting leader, overturning his impeachment by opposition lawmakers three months ago.

The court's ruling on Monday marks just one front in the deepening turmoil as it simultaneously weighs the far more consequential case of conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, whose December impeachment over his brief but stunning martial law decree has left the country's leadership in limbo for months.

Here's a look at the court's decision and what's ahead: 

The prime minister typically holds limited authority as the country's second-highest official. But Han, a career bureaucrat who has held various government roles since the 1970s, was elevated as the government's caretaker after South Korea's opposition-controlled National Assembly impeached Yoon on Dec. 14.

Yoon's impeachment, triggered by his short-lived imposition of martial law that month, immediately suspended his presidential powers and put his political fate in the hands of the Constitutional Court, which is nearing a decision on whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.

As acting president, Han quickly clashed with the liberal opposition Democratic Party, mainly over his refusal to comply with their demand to immediately fill three vacant seats on the Constitutional Court's nine-member bench.




The composition of the court is a sensitive issue since removing Yoon from office requires the support of at least six justices, and a full bench would likely increase the chances of his ouster. Han said he wouldn't appoint the justices without bipartisan consent, but the Democrats accused him of siding with the conservatives in the governing People Power Party, which has been campaigning for Yoon's return to power.

Days after lawmakers impeached Han on Dec. 27, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, who stepped in as acting president, filled two of the court's vacancies but refused to appoint a progressive justice nominated by the opposition.

Seven of the court's eight justices overturned or dismissed Han's impeachment, ruling that the accusations against him were either not illegal, not serious enough to warrant his removal or that the impeachment motion had failed to meet the required quorum when it passed through the National Assembly. One justice upheld Han's impeachment.

After his reinstatement, Han called for national unity and emphasized the need to focus on addressing external challenges stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies.

Han's case is unlikely to serve as a preview of how the court will rule on Yoon. Han played no meaningful role in planning or enforcing Yoon's martial law, which was lifted by a legislative vote just hours after Yoon declared it on the night of Dec. 3.

But Han's reinstatement still struck a nerve with the Democrats, who have recently criticized the court for its prolonged deliberation on Yoon's case, which has fueled concerns about a divide among justices, potentially paving the way for Yoon's return.

Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon, questioned why the court didn't consider Han's refusal to appoint the justices an impeachable offense. He said Han's actions amounted to a “clear and deliberate violation of his constitutional duty to form a government body.”

Lee also called for the court to make a swift decision on Yoon.

Yoon's office issued a statement welcoming Han's reinstatement, asserting that the court's decision proved the opposition's “excessive impeachment attempts were reckless, malicious, and politically motivated.”

Yoon, who is also facing a separate criminal trial on rebellion charges, stands accused of abusing military power, bypassing constitutional and legal protocols to impose martial law, and orchestrating a failed attempt to dissolve the legislature. But the Constitutional Court likely won't take a deep dive into Yoon's criminal allegations, as it's only required to rule whether or not he can remain in office.

Some experts say Han's testimony before lawmakers, investigators and the court regarding the short-lived martial law decree could possibly influence how justices rule on Yoon's case.

Among the various accusations against Yoon, the National Assembly has alleged that he bypassed a constitutional requirement to deliberate in a formal Cabinet meeting before declaring martial law. Han's testimony has seemingly supported these claims.

While Yoon called 11 Cabinet members to his office shortly before declaring martial law on late-night television, Han has said the gathering did not qualify as a formal Cabinet meeting and that Yoon unilaterally informed them of his decision rather than inviting deliberation.

Han and other top officials, including Choi and Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, have said they attempted to talk Yoon out of martial law, citing potential damage to the country's international reputation and economy. Under South Korea's constitution, such powers can only be exercised during wartime or comparable national emergencies.

Even some Republicans have called president's public demand to remove the painting ‘petty'

Donald Trump critics aimed ridicule at the president after he publicly demanded the removal of his portrait at Colorado's state capitol building, calling it “truly the worst”.

In a post on his Truth Social platform on Sunday, Trump shared an image of the portrait and complained about the painting, saying it was bad and blaming it on Colorado's governor, Jared Polis – whom the president insulted as being “radically left”.

A Republican admirer of Trump actually commissioned the portrait.

In two follow-up posts, Trump shared separate images of himself in an apparent attempt to distribute photos that he considered more flattering.

Liberal and anti-Trump commentators laughed at the president's reaction on social media.

On X, Sam Stein of MSNBC wrote that he was “absolutely dying” over how Trump was so upset by his portrait “that he couldn't resist posting” about it. Stein said it was also funny “how objectively bad the portrait is”.

Former Republican attorney Ron Filipkowski, editor-in-chief of the liberal news website MeidasTouch Network, wrote on X that Trump was “the most fragile, sensitive snowflake in history” while sharing a screenshot of the president's Truth Social post.

Another social media account named Republicans Against Trump also shared the president's post while calling him “a petty, insecure baby”.

Trump alleged without evidence that his portrait had been “purposefully distorted”. The president then complained that his Democratic presidential predecessor Barack Obama “looks wonderful” in his portrait at the Colorado capitol.

Despite Trump's criticism of Polis for the painting, it was actually unveiled by a Republican group in 2019. A former Republican state senator had crowdfunded nearly $10,000 to commission the painting, according to Colorado news station KUSA.

Trump did not have a portrait hanging in the Colorado state capitol for his first presidency, which began in 2017. In 2018, a liberal political activist placed a large portrait of Vladimir Putin – whom Trump openly admires – in the empty space, but it was quickly removed by capitol staff.

That prompted then Republican state senator Kevin Grantham to raise money through a GoFundMe campaign to hang Trump's portrait in the state capitol.

“I would much prefer not having a picture than having this one,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post, and further said the governor “should be ashamed of himself”!

It was unclear what triggered Trump's tirade about the portrait.

A Polis spokesperson told KUSA that the governor was “surprised to learn the President of the United States is an aficionado of our Colorado state capitol and its artwork”.

“We appreciate the president and everyone's interest in our capitol building and are always looking for any opportunity to improve our visitor experience,” the Polis spokesperson added.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Elderly woman with dementia found in home she shared with daughter, with over 24 dogs running loose

A woman in Colorado is facing dozens of criminal charges after her 76-year-old mother with dementia was found mauled to death among more than two dozen dogs living at their home.

Jessica Hoff, 47, was arrested on Friday in connection to the death of LaVonne Hoff, said a news release from the sheriff's office in Pueblo county, Colorado, that laid out a case containing elder and animal neglect allegations.

The sheriff's office said first responders pronounced Hoff dead at the Colorado City home which she shared with her daughter after deputies had been called to investigate a report about an unconscious woman on 3 February. Deputies noted that there were several dogs running around the Hoffs' home – and there were about 24 other dogs and seven birds in cages there.

An autopsy later revealed that LaVonne Hoff had died of injuries resulting from a dog attack, the sheriff's office said. Before she died, her daughter had left her home alone to run errands about 25 miles away in Pueblo, and the dogs that were loose at their property mauled the mother, deputies alleged.

Investigators subsequently searched a second property in Colorado City owned by Jessica Hoff. And there, they allegedly discovered 54 more dogs as well as seven more birds in her possession. The animals were “living in unsanitary conditions, and several of the dogs were in poor health”, the sheriff's office wrote in its news release on the case.

Deputies worked with local animal control officers to seize the dogs and birds in question.

Meanwhile, they booked Jessica Hoff on criminal negligence resulting in the death of an at-risk adult as well as 54 counts of aggravated cruelty to animals.

Hoff remained in custody on Monday at the Pueblo county jail, online records show. She was being held in lieu of $50,000 bail.

Under Colorado law, criminal negligence resulting in an at-risk person's death can carry between two and six years in prison. And aggravated cruelty to animals can carry between a year and 18 months in prison.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Sarah Silverman, John Mulaney, Will Ferrell and others pull no punches at first signature event at cultural center since Trump took over

Leading comedians have defied Donald Trump's takeover of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in a show that one described as “the most entertaining gathering of the resistance, ever”.

Trump did not attend Sunday's Mark Twain Prize for American Humor honouring Conan O'Brien for lifetime achievement in comedy. But his ears may have been burning as comics and celebrities joked at his expense in what became a rallying cry for freedom of artistic expression.

None was more direct than Sarah Silverman, who told how she had appeared on O'Brien's late night TV show. “They wrote a bit where Conan interviews Hitler, who comes on because he's embarrassed that he's being compared to Donald Trump,” she recalled, “and they cast me as Hitler”.

Silverman, a Jewish woman, was not an obvious choice for the part. “They chose me and it's this way of thinking that makes Conan great again.” Turning to look at O'Brien, who has ginger hair, she added: “I just really miss the days when you were America's only orange asshole.” The audience erupted in laughter.

Silverman also referenced an episode of O'Brien's show in which she took a sideways photo of his mouth so that it resembled a vagina. She urged the audience to look under their seats for a photo of O'Brien's lips then alluded to Trump's notorious boast on Access Hollywood about touching women's genitals.

“You go ahead and leave those photos on your seat when you go. The guy who took over loves grabbing pussy.”

Trump's seizure of the Kennedy Center in Washington has shaken the arts world. That change has come to the flagship venue was clear from the moment celebrities walked a red carpet opposite a wall mounted with gold-framed photos of Trump, first lady Melania Trump, and the vice-president and second lady, JD Vance and Usha Vance.

It was the first signature event here since Trump last month appointed himself chair, pushing out billionaire philanthropist David Rubenstein. He also dismissed board members appointed by Joe Biden and installed officials loyal to him.

Trump handed leadership reins for the Kennedy Center to Richard Grenell, a close ally and former ambassador to Germany who is serving as envoy for special missions in the current administration.

The new board, which includes the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and Usha Vance, fired the center's president, Deborah Rutter. Trump posted on social media that those who were dismissed “do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture”.

Several artists, including the producers of the musical Hamilton and actor and writer Issa Rae, have announced they are cancelling appearances at the venue. Ticket sales have also slumped.

On Sunday night, a series of comedians paying tribute to O'Brien did not pull their punches, with many targeting the institution's uncertain future and some implying that the prize itself would be unlikely to survive the Trump era.

John Mulaney said: “It's an honour to be here at the Kennedy Center or, as it will be known next week, the Roy Cohn Pavilion for Big, Strong Men Who Love Cats.” Cohn, a hardboiled lawyer, was Trump's mentor. Trump praised Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats during a visit to the arts complex last week.

Mulaney added: “Congratulations to my friend Conan O'Brien on receiving the 26th and final Mark Twain prize.”

Will Ferrell described the event as a distraction because “I'm supposed to be shutting down the Department of Education”.

In a segment involving increasingly spicy chicken wings, late night host Stephen Colbert said: “In light of the new leadership of the Kennedy Center, all of these are right wings and a couple of them are truly insane.”

Praising O'Brien, Colbert continued: “He never backs down. Case in point, when he accepted the Mark Twain prize, this was a very different place. Today they announced two board members: Bashar al-Assad and Skeletor” – referring to the former dictator of Syria and a cartoon villain.

David Letterman, another giant of late night, acknowledged the iconoclastic mood in the auditorium when he said: “I'm not a historian, but I believe that history will show in the history for all time, this will have been the most entertaining gathering of the resistance, ever.”

O'Brien was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of NBC's Late Night show in 1993 despite no significant on-camera experience. He had spent the previous years as a writer for Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons but went on to host Late Night for 16 years. He went on to host another talkshow on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows, and hosted this year's Oscars.

Not known as a political satirist, O'Brien used his acceptance speech on Sunday to make pointed comments about the current climate. “Thanks to the people who invited me here a few months ago, Deborah Rutter and David Rubenstein,” he said. “Honestly, I don't know why they're not here tonight. I lost wifi in January. I guess they're stuck in traffic.

“And a special thanks to all the beautiful people who have worked here at the Kennedy Center for years and who are worried about what the future might bring. My eternal thanks for their selfless devotion to the arts.” The audience stood, clapping and whooping.

Standing beside the prize, a bust of 19th-century writer and humorist Twain, O'Brien went on to note: “Twain hated bullies … He punched up, not down, and he deeply, deeply empathised with the weak. Twain was allergic to hypocrisy and he loathed racism.

“Twain was suspicious of populism, jingoism, imperialism, the money-obsessed mania of the Gilded Age and any expression of mindless American might or self-importance.”

He added: “Above all, Twain was a patriot in the best sense of the world. He loved America but knew it was deeply flawed. Twain wrote, ‘Patriotism is supporting your country all of the time and your government when it deserves it.'” Again the audience roared its approval.

But the night ended on a suitably lighthearted and zany note as performers dressed as Twain danced on stage while O'Brien and Adam Sandler played Neil Young's Rockin' in the Free World.

Previous winners of the Mark Twain prize include Kevin Hart, Sandler, Jon Stewart, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Carol Burnett. Sunday's show will be streamed on Netflix on 4 May.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Trump used their price as a campaign issue but has been unable to stop costs rising. Why do eggs matter so much?

As the Trump economy continues to perform with all the robustness and reliability of a Tesla Cybertruck, one thing, above anything else, has come to be seen as a measure of how the US is faring: the humble egg.

The egg holds a uniquely central place in American culture, egg experts say, and the soaring price in recent months, largely due to a bird flu outbreak, has been discussed and debated across the country.

About 30 million chickens have been culled due to the disease, making a mockery of Donald Trump's campaign trail promises to reduce grocery prices. Eggs cost 59% more in February compared with a year earlier, and while the price has declined in recent days, the government has predicted egg costs will inch back up. But the egg focus raises the question: why has the egg become the de facto barometer for economic success in the US?

“We all know that famous phrase from James Carville: ‘It's the economy, stupid.' This is like that, but, I suppose it's the pedestrian, grounded version of that, without having to understand economics or anything like that. Everybody knows how much eggs cost,” said Clodagh Harrington, a lecturer in American politics at University College Cork.

“They're not steak, they're not champagne, they're not things that a lot of people will never have. And they're not a kind of disgusting, low-budget, fast food either. They are considered, with some caveats, to be a reasonably healthy food option. So there's a kind of a commonality there that everybody knows the price of eggs.”

The ongoing egg price outrage could be seen as a political problem of Republicans' own making. On the campaign trail Trump stood in front of an array of groceries, Kim Jong-il style, and lamented that “grocery prices have skyrocketed”.

“When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on day one,” Trump said.

Later in the campaign, JD Vance held a press conference at a supermarket in Pennsylvania, where he wielded a carton of 12 eggs and complained that they cost $4. The stunt didn't work as Vance intended – many people noticed that there was a sign behind him advertising a dozen eggs for sale at $2.99 – but it made clear that eggs could be an important political tool.

As the Trump administration seeks to fight the bad publicity around high egg prices, it has suggested some unusual solutions.

Brooke Rollins, the secretary of agriculture, was dispatched to Fox News in early March to defend the price surge, and suggested that people combat prices by buying their own chickens and having them roam around their property.

“People are sort of looking around and thinking: ‘Wow, maybe I could get a chicken in my back yard and it's awesome,'” Rollins said. She provided no evidence that people were increasingly keeping chickens in their backyards as a result of the increase in egg prices, and the Guardian was unable to find any case studies.

In a stark contrast to Trump's nationalist policies, the government is now seeking to import eggs, and has asked Denmark and a variety of other European countries to help. In February the Turkish egg producers central union said it would export 420m eggs to the US in 2025.

But another solution to the crisis would be to just stop eating eggs. Why can't Americans quit them?

“There's a kind of a classic aspect of the American breakfast: your coffee and your eggs,” Harrington said.

“In Europe, maybe it's not quite so much that. In Europe if you're on the mainland, you might be having a croissant, if you're in Britain or Ireland, you might be having something a bit more stodgy.

“Even the diner culture, that's something that we don't really have over here. The second half of the 20th century, that classic imagery of the people in the diner, very often they were eating eggs. So that there's a kind of a cultural touchstone element to it.”

Americans' relationship with eggs has been nurtured by the American Egg Board, a pro-egg lobbying group set up by Congress in 1976 to promote the interests of egg farmers and increase demand for eggs.

The American Egg Board, which boasts of being “Home to the Incredible Egg” – largely just a list of egg-based recipes – duly began running a series of TV egg advertisements in the late 1970s, aiming to cement eggs as inextricably tied to American home life.

One such advert, which ran in 1978, featured the actor James Hampton, who had previously starred in The Longest Yard and would go on to appear in Teen Wolf and Teen Wolf Too. The commercial featured shots of eggs in a variety of guises – fried, poached, scrambled and soft boiled – as Hampton declared: “Eggs are a natural wonder.”

Eggs are “an indispensable part of Americans' daily lives”, said Emily Metz, president and CEO of the American Egg Board.

“Eggs matter to people. More than 90% of US households buy eggs, and it's no surprise people are concerned, especially during periods of higher egg prices. We know people are frustrated, and we understand and share those concerns.”

Metz said egg farmers were engaged in the “fight of their lives” against bird flu.

“Egg farmers appreciate the patience their customers and consumers have shown during these challenging times. America's egg farmers are working hard to protect their farms and birds so they can continue supplying the nutritious eggs Americans love,” she said.

There have been signs that egg prices may be declining. Rollins claimed on Tuesday that the average price of a dozen eggs had declined by $1.85 since 26 February – although the US Department of Agriculture reported on Thursday that the egg market was actually “slow to moderate”, and said that the price dip may be mostly due to people buying less.

And Rollins herself warned that “we expect [the price of eggs] to perhaps inch back up” in the coming weeks, given demand for eggs is likely to increase as Easter approaches.

While the fate of the US has been intertwined with the egg for generations, the prolonged love affair, for now, will continue to be strained.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

President announces ‘secondary tariff' amid baseless claim that Venezuela is sending criminals to the US 

Donald Trump said on Monday that any country that buys oil or gas from Venezuela will pay a 25% tariff on trades made with the US.

This “secondary tariff” will take effect on 2 April, the president announced in a Truth Social post. He cited “numerous reasons” for the move, including his baseless repeated claim that “Venezuela has purposefully and deceitfully sent to the United States, undercover, tens of thousands of high level, and other, criminals, many of whom are murderers and people of a very violent nature”.

He adds: “Among the gangs they sent to the United States, is Tren de Aragua, which has been given the designation of ‘Foreign Terrorist Organization'.” Tren de Aragua has been the organisation cited by Trump when he controversially invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law meant only to be used in wartime, to deport more than 250 mainly Venezuelan alleged gang members to El Salvador last week. It was formally designated a “foreign terrorist organization” by the US last month.

In his post, Trump goes on: “In addition, Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the freedoms which we espouse.”

Finally, he referred to 2 April as “LIBERATION DAY IN AMERICA”.

In February, Trump announced the US would scrap a license granted to Chevron since 2022 to operate in Venezuela and export its oil and gave the company until April to wind down its operations there, after he accused President Nicolás Maduro of not making progress on electoral reforms and migrant returns.

Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump was considering a plan to extend Chevron's license by 60 days and impose financial penalties on other countries that do business with the South American nation. It followed a meeting with Chevron's CEO Mike Wirth and other top oil executives.

After a little over an hour, oral arguments just ended in the supreme court challenging Louisiana's congressional map. The justices seemed closely divided and it's hard to know exactly how they're going to rule.

Canada's new prime minister Mark Carney said on Monday he was available for a call with Donald Trump but would do so “on our terms as a sovereign country”.

Calls with the US president traditionally take place soon after the election of a new leader, but the two men have yet to speak since Carney was elected leader of the ruling Liberal Party on 9 March, automatically becoming prime minister.

Speaking to reporters in Newfoundland, Carney said he assumed Trump was waiting to see who won the general election before calling the winner. He added:

I'm available for a call, but you know, we're going to talk on our terms as a sovereign country, not as what he pretends we are.

Carney on Sunday triggered an election for 28 April, a contest that is widely expected to focus on the strained relationship with the US amid threats to Canada's economic and political future.

Trump has figured prominently into Canada's political narrative, repeatedly threatening to wage economic war on the US's closest ally and one of its largest trading partners, with the end goal of annexing the country's northern neighbor.

Those threats, and the prospect of painful tariffs on Canadian goods, have electrified the country, with a groundswell of patriotism, calls to boycott American goods and an “elbows up” rallying cry.

Back at Louisiana v. Callais, Edward Greim, a lawyer representing those challenging the map, is now making his arguments to the justices. A good portion of his argument has focused on whether or not the state had a good reason to redraw the state's congressional map. There has been a lot of tussling over whether the court order the state was under was good enough of a reason.

Trump will gather his cabinet secretaries for a third known meeting on Monday morning with Elon Musk expected to attend, a senior administration official has told NBC News.

The official described the 11 am ET gathering as a “follow up on the last Doge meeting”, in reference to a meeting on 6 March where Trump placed limits on the billionaire tycoon's authority amid backlash to new cuts by the so-called “department of government efficiency”. He wrote on his Truth Social platform after that meeting:

We just had a meeting with most of the secretaries, Elon, and others, and it was a very positive one. It's very important that we cut levels down to where they should be, but it's also important to keep the best and most productive people. We're going to have these meetings every two weeks until that aspect of this very necessary job is done.

Back at the hearing, Stuart Naifeh, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund representing Black voters, is now beginning his oral argument.

This court has been clear that states have breathing room to take reasonable efforts to comply with the Voting Rights Act, and they may also balance the many other interests that enter the redistricting calculus.

It was perfectly appropriate after two federal courts had found that Louisiana had likely violated section two, that the state sought to comply with those rulings and that it exercised its authority to protect favored incumbents and unite preferred communities of interest and accounting for those types of political considerations is squarely the legislature's prerogative.

Here's some useful background to the case regarding Louisiana's majority-Black districts that Sam Levine is covering for us which, he writes, could be vehicle for court to further weaken the Voting Rights Act.

The case, Louisiana v Callais, arrives at the supreme court after years of legal wrangling over Louisiana's congressional map.

After the 2020 census, Louisiana's Republican-controlled legislature only drew one majority-Black congressional district when it redrew the boundaries for the state's six seats in Congress. A group of Black voters, who make up about a third of the state's population, sued the state in 2022, arguing that section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race, required lawmakers to add a second majority-Black congressional district.

A federal judge agreed with that argument, blocked the state from using the map, and told the state to add a second majority-Black district, which it did.

A group of non-African American voters then sued in a different court, saying the new map unconstitutionally sorted voters based on their race. They pointed out that the new district was unusually shaped and that race had predominated in drawing it. A court struck down Louisiana's new map in 2024, but the US supreme court allowed it to be used for elections last year. Cleo Fields, a Black Democrat, won the seat last fall.

A ruling in favor of the non-African American voters who challenged the districts could further chip away at the Voting Rights Act by making it nearly impossible for lawmakers to draw districts that comply with the landmark civil rights law.

Sara Rohani, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which represents the voters who challenged the original map in Louisiana and is arguing in defense of the current one, said:

It would basically lead to just endless collateral attacks on maps that were drawn to remedy Voting Rights Act violations and even potentially existing districts that are compliant with section 2.

At the hearing J. Benjamin Aguiñaga, Louisiana's solicitor general, is doing a delicate dance in his arguments to the justices. In response to a question from Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Louisiana has argued in other litigation that Section 2 is unconstitutional as applied to the state. But he acknowledges courts have not embraced the state's interpretation of the law so far.

“At least as things stand now, we're duty bound to comply with the Voting Rights Act,” Aguiñaga said.

Oral arguments are just getting started in Louisiana v. Callais are just getting here.

“Louisiana would rather not be here,” J. Benjamin Aguiñaga, the state's solicitor general, opened his arguments. “Our fundamental question today is how do we get out of this predicament.”

A group of 199 Venezuelan migrants deported from the US arrived on Monday after the two countries reached an agreement to restart flights, Venezuela's interior minister Diosdado Cabello said.

A diplomatic spat last week inflamed already tense relations as the US accused Venezuela of refusing to accept deportations flights, while Caracas accused Washington of blocking them. As that unfolded, a plane-load of deported Venezuelans had arrived from Mexico, a country that has agreed to accept migrants from other countries sent by the US.

Cabello said flights have been inconsistent “not because of Venezuela,” adding that they will “depend on the United States.” The US sent the deportees first to Honduras, where they were picked up by Venezuelan state airline Conviasa and arrived in Caracas at 1am local time. The US does not deport migrants directly to Venezuela due to the strained diplomatic relationship between the two countries.

“We expect to see a consistent flow of deportation flights to Venezuela going forward,” the US state department's bureau of western hemisphere affairs said in a post on X confirming the flight.

It comes after Donald Trump invoked an obscure wartime law to rapidly deport people who were, according to the White House, members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which Washington has declared a terrorist group and alien enemy.

Despite a judge quickly blocking the measure, the Trump administration deported more than 200 Venezuelans - 137 under the wartime act - to El Salvador where they are being detained in the country's massive anti-terrorism prison.

Venezuela denies the migrants' involvement in the criminal group, which the government claims was eradicated. Lawyers and family members of the migrants also deny their gang ties and say some may have been deported because of their tattoos, which they said US immigration authorities claimed imply gang ties.

Cabello said on Monday that the Venezuelans in El Salvador were being “held hostage” and demanded that their rights be respected.

The US supreme court is hearing a case this morning that could upend Louisiana's congressional map and have significant implications for the makeup of the US Congress and voting rights.

At the center of the case is Louisiana's 6th congressional district. State lawmakers drew the oddly shaped district in 2022 after they were ordered to add a second majority-Black district in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act. A group of non-Black voters challenged that district, saying lawmakers had unlawfully sorted voters based on their race. The supreme court allowed the map to be used for elections last year and Cleo Fields, a Black Democrat, won the seat.

The supreme court has long said that lawmakers can consider race if it serves a “compelling interest” and its use is “narrowly tailored” to that interest. Those challenging the map say the state did not meet that standard.

The case is being closely watched both because of the close partisan balance of the US House and to see whether the court will further weaken protections for minority voters when it comes to redistricting.

We'll bring you more on this as we get it.

Mia Love, first Black Republican woman elected to Congress, dies aged 49

Mia Love, a daughter of Haitian immigrants who became the first Black Republican woman elected to Congress, died on Sunday at the age of 49.

The former US House member of Utah had undergone recent treatment for brain cancer and received immunotherapy as part of a clinical trial at Duke University's brain tumor center. Her daughter said earlier this month that the former lawmaker was no longer responding to treatment. Love died at her home in Saratoga Springs, Utah, according to a statement posted by the family.

Love didn't emphasize her race during her campaigns, but she acknowledged the significance of her election after her 2014 victory. She said her win defied naysayers who had suggested that a Black, Republican, Mormon woman couldn't win a congressional seat in overwhelmingly white Utah.

She was briefly considered a rising star within the GOP and she kept her distance from Donald Trump, who was unpopular with many Utah voters during his successful run for his first presidency in 2016.

In an op-ed published earlier this month in the Deseret News, Love described the version of America she grew up loving and shared her enduring wish for the nation to become less divisive. She thanked her medical team and every person who had prayed for her.

British prime minister Keir Starmer and Donald Trump held a brief call on Sunday to discuss progress on a new economic deal between the two countries, Downing Street said this morning.

At the lobby briefing, asked about reports that the government may cut the digital services tax, to help US tech firms and to persuade the White House to reduce the impact of tariffs on the UK in return, the PM's spokesperson replied:

Firstly, just taking a step back, the UK is working with the United States on an economic prosperity deal, building on our shared strength of that commitment to economic security. As part of those discussions, the prime minister and President Trump discussed progress made in those discussions last night. The UK will only do a deal in the national interest, which reflects this government's mandate to deliver economic stability for British people.

The spokesperson did not say whether or not the digital services tax came up in the call. But he said the government remained in favour of the tax in principle.

On the prospects of a trade deal, the spokesperson said that “good progress” was being made. But he confirmed that what was being envisaged was less a full-blown free trade agreement, and more a deal just covering certain sectors.

Downing Street also refused to respond directly to the claim from Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff that Starmer's stance on Ukraine amounts to “posturing”.

Asked if Starmer was happy for one of Trump's closest advisers to be talking in these terms, the PM's spokesperson said that Starmer himself has explained in detail why he is working on plans for a “coalition of the willing” to support Ukraine, and why a peace deal would need military underpinning.

The prime minister is focused on delivering the right outcome in Ukraine. There's frequent engagement with President Trump to that end, with shared vision with President Trump in terms of bringing a durable peace in Ukraine.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

US carmaker's European market share falls as Chinese rival BYD overtakes it on global revenue, topping $100bn

Sales of new Tesla cars slumped in Europe last month in the latest indication of a potential buyer backlash over Elon Musk's high profile and controversial behaviour since becoming a leading figure in Donald Trump's administration.

The Texas-based electric carmaker sold less than 16,000 vehicles across Europe last month, down 44% on average across 25 countries in the EU, the UK, Norway and Switzerland, according to data compiled by the research platform Jato Dynamics.

Tesla's market share fell to 9.6% last month, the lowest it has registered in February for five years. In January, its sales across Europe fell 45%, from 18,161 in 2024 to 9,945.

However, in the UK the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reported an almost 21% rise in the number of new Tesla cars registered in February, with the Model 3 and Model Y proving the second and third most popular after the Mini Cooper.

Analysts and investors have been attempting to assess what impact Musk's political interventions are having on the carmaker, where he is chief executive, amid signs that his senior role in Trump's administration is leading to a consumer backlash by some Tesla owners or prospective buyers. Tesla dealerships have also been the target of protests.

The tech billionaire and close Trump adviser has shown support for Germany's far-right AfD party, theatrically brandished a “chainsaw of democracy” at a conservative conference, and accused Keir Starmer and other senior politicians of covering up the scandal about grooming gangs.

However, analysts have said that the volatile sales are also likely to have been affected by Tesla's overhaul of the Model Y.

Felipe Muñoz, a global analyst at Jato Dynamics, said: “Tesla is experiencing a period of immense change. In addition to Elon Musk's increasingly active role in politics and the increased competition it is facing within the EV market, the brand is phasing out the existing version of the Model Y – its bestselling vehicle – before it rolls out the update.

“Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover.”

The research company's figures for February show that Tesla's rivals powered ahead in Europe last month.

Volkswagen reported a 180% increase in sales of battery electric vehicles to just under 20,000, while BMW and Mini sold a combined 19,000 such models last month.

The Chinese-owned BYD recorded a 94% increase in sales in Europe to more than 4,000. Separate figures show that BYD's global sales topped $100bn (£83bn) last year, overtaking Tesla as the world's biggest electric car company by revenue.

BYD, which last beat Tesla on global annual revenues in 2018, reported revenues of 777bn yuan (£86bn) in 2024, a 29% year-on-year increase, beating analyst estimates. Tesla reported annual revenues of $97.7bn last year.

BYD also sells about the same number of electric vehicles as Tesla – 1.76m compared with 1.79m respectively in 2024. However, when sales of BYD's other hybrid cars are included it is much larger.

Polestar, which is primarily owned by Volvo's parent company, Geely, recorded an 84% increase to more than 2,000 vehicles.

BYD sold 4.27m vehicles last year, almost as many as the 4.5m sold by Ford, and has forecast that it will sell between 5m and 6m this year. The Hong Kong-listed company has a market value of about $160bn, up about 50% so far this year. Tesla is valued at $780bn despite a share-price plunge of more than a third in 2025. Tesla shares opened up 6% on Monday as the wider Nasdaq index rose nearly 2%.

Total car sales in across the 25 EU markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland dropped by 3% to 970,000 in February, while BEV registrations were up by a quarter.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Trump was responding to Clooney's call to defend press freedoms while promoting his new stage version of Good Night, and Good Luck

Donald Trump has taken aim at the actor and prominent Democrat activist George Clooney, dismissing his interview on US TV news programme 60 Minutes as a “total puff piece”.

The Oscar-winning star was the subject of Sunday's show to promote his Broadway debut, in a stage version of the film Good Night, and Good Luck, in which he plays veteran journalist Edward R Murrow, who took part in a historic TV showdown with Senator Joseph McCarthy.

In the interview, Clooney, 63, spoke about his decision to drop his support for Joe Biden, penning an op-ed in the New York Times thought to be key in Biden's decision to step down. The battle between the government and the press, said Clooney, is a “fight for the ages”.

“You see it happening at the LA Times, you see it happening at the Washington Post,” he said, in reference to protests by staff at the two titles at their rightwing owners, both of whom clamped down on the papers choosing to endorse a candidate at last year's election.

Clooney drew parallels between the events Good Night, and Good Luck dramatises and the difficulties faced by reporters in pursuit of truth today. The actor cited Trump's $16m recent defamation settlement with ABC News, as well as the $20bn “voter interference” suit Trump filed against CBS last October in which he claimed 60 Minutes had “deceptively edited” an interview with his rival, Kamala Harris, to present her in a more flattering light.

Said Clooney: “When the other three estates fail, when the judiciary and the executive and the legislative branches fail us, the fourth estate has to succeed.”

“ABC has just settled a lawsuit with the Trump administration. And CBS News is in the process … We're seeing this idea of using government to scare or fine or use corporations – to make journalists smaller.”

“Governments don't like the freedom of the press. They never have. And that goes for whether you are a conservative or a liberal or whatever side you're on. They don't like the press,” he added.

Trump took to Truth Social to combat Clooney's arguments, and to offer a broadside against the show.

“Why would the now highly discredited 60 Minutes be doing a total ‘puff piece' on George Clooney, a second-rate movie ‘star' and failed political pundit,” wrote Trump.

“He fought hard for Sleepy Joe's election, and then, right after the Debate, dumped him like a dog. Later, I assume under orders from the Obama camp, pushed all out for ‘Kamala,' only to soon realise that this was not going to work out too well.”

He then reiterated his earlier claims against the show, saying: “60 Minutes even fraudulently inserted Fake answers into her disastrous interview, aired just before Election Day, in one of the most embarrassing and dishonest events in broadcast history … And now George Clooney again? His press agent should be making a fortune!!!”

Asked about his article asking Biden to step down as he felt he simply “cannot win”, Clooney, whose father was a journalist, said: “I'll make it kind of easy. I was raised to tell the truth.

“I had seen the president up close for this fundraiser, and I was surprised. And so I feel as if there was a lot of profiles in cowardice in my party through all of that. And I was not proud of that. And I also believed I had to tell the truth …

At the time, Trump hit back at Clooney for his article, calling him a “fake movie actor” who “never came close to making a great movie”.

“What does Clooney know about anything?” Trump added. “Clooney should get out of politics and go back to television. Movies never really worked for him!!!”

Appearing on Stephen Colbert's talkshow last week to promote his play, Clooney was asked about his feelings about the defeat of Harris last year.

“Well I don't know, what am I supposed to do? Storm the fucking Capitol?” he said in reference to the 6 January insurrection, to applause from the audience. Without saying Trump's name, Clooney also had a message for the new president, saying: “Good for you. I hope you do well because our country needs it, and we will meet you in 3.5 years and see where we go next.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Discovery of a suspected training and extermination camp for a drug cartel has sparked protests across the country

The shoes and backpacks, arranged in neat rows, make it look almost like a school cloakroom. But the ranch where they were found is an alleged training camp and killing site for Mexico's Jalisco cartel.

The discovery by activists of underground ovens and 200 pairs of shoes in what they call an “extermination camp” has horrified Mexico, sparking protests across the country.

It is the highest-profile such case in years – and has forced the spotlight back on to Mexico's crisis of forced disappearances related to organised crime. Across the country, more than 120,000 people are registered as missing.

“These places exist all over the country,” said María Guadalupe Aguilar, founder of Familias Unidas por Nuestros Desaparecidos, who has been searching for her son José Luis Arana since 17 January 2011. “Mexico is full of mass graves.”

Authorities have offered few answers about the camp, which was found near the town of Teuchitlán, 60km (37 miles) from Guadalajara, Mexico's second largest city.

They say it may have been operated by the Jalisco cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful organised crime groups, but have yet to say how many people died there, and none of the remains have been identified.

On Wednesday, federal attorney general Alejandro Gertz said the initial investigation had been riddled with omissions, pointing the blame at local authorities.

Although the ranch was secured by state authorities in September last year, the ovens and more than 1,000 items of clothing were only reported earlier this month when Warrior Searchers of Jalisco, a collective of relatives of missing people, went there after receiving an anonymous tip. Within a few hours, they found human remains.

Gertz said his office is exploring whether failures in the initial investigation were due to incompetence or collusion with organised crime.

As shock waves from the case passed through Mexico, several people claiming to be survivors came forward with testimonies, describing how they were lured to the ranch with fake offers of work.

Their accounts coincide with previous reports of forced recruitment in Jalisco, in which young people responded to job adverts online before being kidnapped and held in dire conditions as they were both victimised and forced to victimise others to survive.

“The training, the abuse, it's designed to dehumanise them, to strip them of themselves,” said Alejandra Guillén, a journalist and academic at Iteso, a university in Guadalajara, who investigates forced disappearances.

“They promised them work and a salary and none of it was true: they began to train them to be sicarios [killers],” said Aguilar, who went to the ranch last week to help classify the clothes.

Photos of every item of clothing have since been put online. Relatives of the disappeared across Mexico have pored over the images. Some have travelled to Jalisco.

“Your skin crawls seeing everything thrown on the ground, seeing the suitcases, the dreams of these young people,” Indira Navarro, one of the activists who discovered the site, told Radio Fórmula. “To see how they ended up there because they thought they could have a better life.”

Training camps and clandestine ovens, often found by search collectives, have been documented across Jalisco for years – including several just a short distance from the ranch.

“Just this year they even found one in the same municipality where they freed 36 people,” said Anna Karolina Chimiak, from the Centre of Justice for Peace and Development, a civil society group in Jalisco.

But it was the image of the shoes, with its echoes of the 20th century's darkest chapters, that meant this discovery broke through.

It remains unclear what became of their owners. But incinerating bodies is a “known practice” in Jalisco, said Chimiak.

It is the latest, cruellest evolution of forced disappearances, said Aguilar: “With ashes, the hope of identifying them is lost.”

In response to the scandal, Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, announced measures to strengthen laws around missing people. She promised the discovery would be investigated fully, unlike high-profile cases under previous governments, such as the 43 student teachers from Ayotzinapa who were disappeared in 2014.

“There will not be impunity,” said Sheinbaum. “We will never hide anything.”

However, Sheinbaum has also claimed that certain media and opposition figures were weaponising the case to attack her government, and pointed to an alleged bot campaign on social media.

Meanwhile authorities have cast doubt on the idea that there were clandestine ovens on the ranch, despite acknowledging the presence of burnt remains.

“It is not a setup, it is not an invention,” responded Warrior Searchers of Jalisco, the collective that found the underground ovens. “It is the harsh reality that we have found in Teuchitlán.”

“It feels more and more like there is a deliberate intent to generate a narrative that nothing happened there,” said Chimiak.

The crisis of forced disappearances in Mexico casts an enduring shadow on Sheinbaum's pledge to reduce violence in Mexico, which was one of the failings of her predecessor and ally, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

Although official data shows a reduction in the number of homicides in recent years, the number of disappearances has risen inexorably.

Jalisco alone has almost 15,000 missing people. It is also the stronghold of the Jalisco New Generation cartel, which was recently declared a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration.

The great number of disappearances in Jalisco might reflect a mix of powerful economic interests, proximity to drug trafficking infrastructure like the port of Manzanillo, and a history of such violence dating back to the Guadalajara cartel and beyond, said Guillén.

Aguilar offered a more straightforward explanation: “Maybe it's because we are in the hands of the most powerful cartel in the world.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Co-founder Anne Wojcicki to pursue independent bid as California attorney general tells users to delete data

The US genetic testing company 23andMe has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US to help sell itself, as its chief executive quit to pursue a bid for the business after several unsuccessful attempts.

23andMe said late on Sunday that it had started voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri to “facilitate a sale process to maximise the value of its business”.

The loss-making company, which provides saliva-based test kits to customers to help them track their ancestry, added that it was operating as usual throughout the sale process. “There are no changes to the way the company stores, manages, or protects customer data,” it said.

The San Francisco-based company said its chief executive and co-founder Anne Wojcicki was stepping down. She has been pushing for a buyout since April last year but was rebuffed by 23andMe's board.

The company is still reeling from a huge data breach in 2023 that affected the data of nearly 7 million people, about half of its customers. Revenues have fallen as many of its 15 million customers scramble to delete their DNA data from the company's archives.

Over the weekend the California attorney general, Rob Bonta, urged the company's users to ask it to “delete your data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company”.

Mark Jensen, the company's chair, said: “After a thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives, we have determined that a court-supervised sale process is the best path forward to maximise the value of the business.

“We are committed to continuing to safeguard customer data and being transparent about the management of user data going forward, and data privacy will be an important consideration in any potential transaction.”

Fighting for survival, 23andMe has cut the jobs of 200 people, amounting to 40% of its workforce, and stopped development of all its therapies in November. Wojcicki's ambition has been to turn the company into a drug developer.

Wojcicki will be replaced by its chief financial officer, Joe Selsavage, until a permanent replacement is found but she is staying on the 23andMe board.

She co-founded the business in 2006 with Linda Avey and Paul Cusenza. In a post on X, she said she was “disappointed” by the bankruptcy filing and that her bid to take the company private was rejected. She explained she had resigned “so I can be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder”.

She added: “If I am fortunate enough to secure the company's assets through the restructuring process, I remain committed to our long-term vision of being a global leader in genetics.”

Wojcicki offered to pay $0.41 (£0.32) a share earlier this month, down by 84% from an offer in February. Her private equity partner walked away after the board's rejection of that bid.

Her latest offer valued 23andMe at $11m, below its current market value of just under $48m, and a long way from its $5.8bn peak in February 2021 after its stock market float on the Nasdaq exchange.

Last autumn, 23andMe agreed to pay $30m and give three years of security monitoring to settle a lawsuit accusing it of failing to protect the privacy of 6.9 million customers whose personal information was exposed in the data breach.

23andMe said it had received a commitment for debtor-in-possession financing of up to $35m from the Los Angeles-based private equity firm JMB Capital Partners, to support the business in the months ahead.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Iranian police are using digital tools to identify and punish women who defy the Islamic state's harsh dress code

Like many women in Iran, Darya is used to feeling under surveillance. Yet in recent months, the 25-year-old finance analyst from northern Tehran says that she never knows who could be watching her every move.

She says she has received messages from the police before warning her of suspected violations of the country's strict hijab laws, but last November she was sent an SMS message containing her car registration plate that stated the exact time and place that she had been recorded driving without her head properly covered. Next time it happened, the SMS warned, her car would be impounded.

“It was really unsettling,” she says.

“When you receive these messages you don't know who has reported you – and the police never seem to have proof of the violation.”

After widespread outcry last year, the Iranian authorities said they would suspend enforcement of the new, strict, hijab laws, which impose draconian penalties – including fines and prison sentences – on women found in breach of the mandatory dress code.

Yet women in Iran are reporting that state surveillance has been steadily increasing.

Last week, the UN's fact-finding mission reported on Iran's increasing reliance on digital surveillance such as its Nazer mobile application, a state-backed reporting platform that allows citizens and police to report women for alleged violations.

The app is accessible only via Iran's state-controlled National Information Network. Members of the public can apply to become “hijab monitors” to get the app and begin filing reports, which are then passed to the police.

According to the UN mission, the app has recently been expanded to allow users to upload the time, location and licence plate of a car in which a woman has been seen without a hijab.

It can also now be used to report women for hijab violations on public transport, in taxis and even in ambulances.

According to the UN report, aerial surveillance using drones has also been used at events such as the Tehran international book fair and on the island of Kish, a tourist destination, to identify women not complying with the hijab law.

The government has also increased online monitoring, blocking women's Instagram accounts for non-compliance of hijab laws, and issuing warnings via text message. CCTV surveillance and facial-recognition technology has also been installed at universities. “This ‘digital repression' is not only stifling academic freedom but also causing increased psychological stress among students,” says a spokesperson for the Amirkabir Newsletter, an Iranian student media group.

Skylar Thompson, deputy director of Human Rights Activists in Iran, says the app represents a dangerous escalation in the regime's digital surveillance efforts. “Not only does this app reinforce gender-based discrimination and empower a culture of fear, but its flaws also raise serious concerns about wrongful arrests and detentions.”

Last July Arezoo Badri, a 31-year-old mother of two, was shot and paralysed when a police officer opened fire on her vehicle in Noor city, Mazandaran province, after her car was reportedly flagged for a hijab violation.

Yet Darya, like many others, is resolute in her defiance. “If you walk through the streets, you'll see that many of us have stopped wearing the hijab despite these intimidation tactics,” she says.

“The money they are wasting on this surveillance could actually help some people survive.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Tens of thousands gathered in Istanbul with unrest likely to continue over treatment of presidential challenger to Erdoğan

Turkey's interior minister said 1,133 people had been detained since protests began on 19 March, AFP reports.

There have been large-scale demonstrations in cities across Turkey since last Wednesday over the arrest of Istanbul mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, the main political rival of president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has slammed his opponents, saying protests against the jailing of Istanbul's mayor, his main political rival, had turned into a “movement of violence”, Reuters reports.

Speaking after a cabinet meeting in Ankara, Erdoğan added that the main opposition CHP was responsible for any property damage and harm to police officers during the protests, which have been taking place across the country since Istanbul mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu was arrested last week. Erdoğan also said that their “show” would eventually end and they would feel ashamed for the “evil” they did to the country.

Turkey has detained more than 1,100 people, including journalists, as demonstrations continue. The mayor's imprisonment is widely regarded as a political move to remove a major challenger to Erdoğan from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028.

AFP gives more details on the German Last Generation protesters who were charged earlier today, including for “forming a criminal organisation”.

The Munich Public Prosecutor's Office confirmed it had filed the charges “against five members” of the movement, which reorganised into two groups earlier this year.

Members of Last Generation released a statement saying they would contest the charges, calling them “an attack on civil society engagement as a cornerstone of democracy”.

Founded in 2021, Last Generation mounted eye-catching, non-violent protests in Germany for several years calling for urgent action to combat climate change. These included throwing mashed potatoes at the glass protecting a Monet painting and repeatedly glueing themselves onto busy roads.

The group's members briefly halted airport traffic several times by breaking into airports and glueing themselves to the tarmac.

In May last year, prosecutors in the state of Brandenburg said they had charged five members of the group with “forming a criminal organisation” in relation to protests at two oil refineries, Berlin airport and the Barberini Museum in Potsdam.

French actor Gerard Depardieu went on trial today over alleged sexual assaults on a film set, in a case that placed one of France's best-known movie stars at the heart of the country's broader reckoning over sexual violence, Reuters reports.

The trial, expected to last at least two days, and possibly more, was initially due to be held in October but was postponed due to Depardieu's ill health.

As he arrived, Depardieu, his hand on his lawyer's shoulder, passed calmly past reporters, looking straight at the cameras without saying a word. His lawyer, Jeremie Assous, told reporters that the accusations were false and based on lies. “Truth is on our side,” he said.

Prosecutors allege assaults against two women – whose full identities have not been revealed – took place during the filming in 2021 of Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters).

The prosecutors accuse Depardieu of groping one of the women, whom they named Amelie K, on the film set. Three people witnessed the scene, prosecutors say. They say the second woman was groped by Depardieu on set and in the street.

Before the opening of the trial, some activists gathered outside the courthouse in northern Paris. A dozen activists from Bruit qui court, a collective of artist and activists, chanted: “Sexist violence, complicit judicial system.” Others held signs with various slogans criticising Depardieu.

Protests are still under way in Turkey, with demonstrations likely to gear up later this evening.

Earlier today students at the main universities in Istanbul and Ankara called for a boycott of lectures, according to AFP. Young protesters were also preparing to hold a rally at 14.00 GMT by Besiktas port on the Bosphorus, ahead of the main nightly rally outside City Hall at 17.30 GMT.

Since last week, rallies have taken place in at least 55 of Turkey's 81 provinces, or more than two-thirds of the country, according to a tally by AFP.

German prosecutors have filed charges against five climate activists of the group Last Generation, including for forming a criminal organisation, AFP reports.

The Munich Public Prosecutor's Office confirmed it had “filed charges against five members of Last Generation with the State Security Chamber... for, among other things, forming a criminal organisation”.

Climate activists from the group glued themselves to the tarmac at four German airports last August, forcing a temporary halt to flights as part of their campaign against fossil fuels.

A nurse accused of murdering nine palliative care patients went on trial in Germany today, with prosecutors saying he played “master of life and death” over them, AFP reports.

Prosecutors said the unnamed 44-year-old man injected a total of 26 patients with large doses of sedatives or painkillers, resulting in the deaths of nine. His motive was allegedly to minimise his workload during his night shifts, prosecutors said at his trial in the western city of Aachen. He was employed in palliative care at a hospital in the nearby town of Wuerselen.

The man allegedly injected the mostly elderly and terminally ill patients and then simply walked out of their rooms, the court heard.

Prosecutors said he lacked motivation in his work and was “annoyed” by the patients, adding that he had considered himself their “master of life and death”.

The nurse did not speak at the start of proceedings. Former colleagues will be called as witnesses in subsequent hearings. The trial's end date is uncertain while investigations are ongoing.

A meeting between Greece and Turkey over long-standing differences was unlikely to take place in the immediate future following the jailing of Istanbul mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, a Greek government spokesperson said, Reuters reports.

Greece and Turkey, both Nato allies but historic foes, have argued for decades over their maritime boundaries in the Aegean Sea, airspace and ethnically divided Cyprus.

After agreeing in 2023 to turn a page in relations and mend ties, the two countries were preparing for a high-level cooperation council this year, as early as April, to discuss bilateral issues.

But the meeting was unlikely to take place in the immediate future, Greek government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis said in a press briefing on Monday, following the detention of İmamoğlu, president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's main political rival.

Isar Aerospace has scrubbed its attempt to launch its first test flight of its orbital launch vehicle from Norway, AP reports.
 Unfavourable winds this afternoon meant that the Spectrum rocket could not be launched from the island of Andøya in northern Norway, the German aerospace company said.
 The company said it could also conduct the test flight later in the week. Another date has not yet been set.

Several opposition figures in Turkey have had their X accounts suspended amid civil unrest in the country, Politico is reporting.

Elon Musk's social media platform has suspended the activity of “university-associated activist accounts, basically sharing protest information, locations for students to go,” Yusuf Can, coordinator and analyst at the Wilson Center's Middle East Program, told Politico.

He added that many of these accounts are “grassroots activists” with their followings in the low tens of thousands.

Politico reports:

The suspensions come after extensive demonstrations were sparked by the arrest earlier this week of Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan's main political rival, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu. İmamoğlu was arrested just hours before he was nominated to be the presidential candidate for the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP).

The opposition protests have spread despite the government banning gatherings for four days.

Much of the opposition activity has centered around universities, and many of those connected to the demonstrations are now finding their X accounts suspended, observers report.

Portugal's foreign minister Paulo Rangel and Chinese counterpart Wang Yi will hold talks in Beijing on Tuesday, as EU member states fret over the prospect of a trade war with both Washington and Beijing.

This week's visit would be the first to China by a high-level Portuguese government official in over five years.

The United States is the main destination for Portuguese exports outside the EU, while Portugal is the only country in western Europe still signed on to Beijing's flagship overseas infrastructure plan, the belt and road initiative.

The European commissioner for trade, Maros Sefcovic, is heading to Washington to meet the US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday, a Commission spokesperson said, Reuters reports.

Sefcovic will also meet with US trade representative Jamieson Greer. The spokesperson declined to provide more details about the discussion.

Donald Trump has threatened the EU – the US' third biggest trading partner – with 25% tariffs. The EU said last week it may delay implementing its threatened response to US steel and aluminium tariffs.

The imprisonment of Istanbul's opposition mayor has come at a time when Turkey finds itself at the centre of geopolitical turmoil that observers say has freed president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to target his most dangerous opponent, Ekrem İmamoğlu, AP reports.
 Analysts say a convergence of international factors gave Erdogan the opportunity to try to neutralise the main threat to him in elections due to be held in 2028, but which could come sooner. “There are a really special confluence of factors that made this seemingly easy for him to pull off in terms of not suffering international condemnation or punishment for it,” said Monica Marks, professor of Middle East studies at New York University Abu Dhabi.

Berk Esen, a political scientist at Istanbul's Sabanci University, said the CHP's decision to confirm İmamoğlu as its presidential candidate for 2028 was key to his arrest. “Erdogan was hopeful that he could slow down, if not completely hinder, Imamoglu's candidacy prospects,” he said. “But when the CHP decided to hold (presidential) primaries, it became clear that İmamoğlu would come out as the candidate for the CHP so Erdogan wanted to move against him right away.”

“Erdogan is playing by the autocrat's playbook, targeting the only institutions able to check his power – judiciaries, universities, and then popular leaders,” said Maya Tudor, professor at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government. “It is important to remember that day-to-day democracy is not about elections, which happen infrequently and under the glare of international media. It is also about the right of opposition politicians to organise and be heard. When politicians like İmamoğlu cannot disagree with Erdogan without being jailed through trumped up charges, a vital pillar of democratic society dies.”

Germany has called the jailing of Istanbul mayor and Turkish opposition leader Ekrem İmamoğlu “totally unacceptable” and said it was following the developments with “great concern”.

“The arrest and suspension of the mayor of Istanbul is totally unacceptable. This must be clarified very quickly and transparently,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz's spokesman Steffen Hebestreit told a press conference.

Reuters provides further quotes from Greenland's outgoing prime minister Mute Egede, who has criticised a visit to the self-governing Danish territory by US second lady Usha Vance planned for later this week.

Egede called the delegation's visit, which runs from Thursday to Saturday, a “provocation” and said his caretaker government would not meet with it.

“Until recently, we could trust the Americans, who were our allies and friends, and with whom we enjoyed working closely,” Egede told local newspaper Sermitsiaq. “But that time is over.”

The Greenlandic government is currently in a caretaker phase following a March 11 parliamentary election won by the Democrats. Jens-Frederik Nielsen, leader of the Democrats, called for political unity and criticised the timing of the visit during coalition talks with municipal elections due next week. “We must not be forced into a power game that we ourselves have not chosen to be a part of,” Nielsen said.

Brian Hughes, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said the visit aims to “build on partnerships that respects Greenland's self-determination and advances economic cooperation”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

H5N1 virus found in single animal in Yorkshire but risk to general public is very low, say experts

Bird flu has been detected in sheep for the first time in the world, UK experts have announced, although they stress the risk to livestock and the general public is low.

The H5N1 virus was detected in a single animal in Yorkshire, England, after routine testing that was carried out because the flock was kept on a site where avian influenza had previously been found in birds. No other sheep in the flock was found to be infected.

The infected animal has since been culled, with the UK's chief veterinary officer saying strict biosecurity measures have been implemented to prevent the further spread of disease.

“While the risk to livestock remains low, I urge all animal owners to ensure scrupulous cleanliness is in place and to report any signs of infection to the Animal and Plant Health Agency immediately,” Christine Middlemiss said.

Bird flu can cause severe illness, including pneumonia, and even death – with experts tracking changes in the H5N1 virus carefully amid fears it could trigger a human pandemic.

While the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes there is no evidence H5N1 passes from human to human, the virus has been detected in a wide range animals other than birds including cats, foxes, otters, bush dogs and pigs, with experts saying a new variant is endemic in dairy cows in the US.

The appearance of H5N1 in cows has been a shock for scientists, given it was previously thought such animals could not easily be infected with the virus.

H5N1 has also been found in humans, although such cases have largely been in dairy and poultry workers. The most recent case in the UK was reported in January, in a farm worker who is known to have had contact with a large number of infected birds.

Dr Meera Chand, the emerging infection lead at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said: “Globally, we continue to see that mammals can be infected with avian influenza A(H5N1). However, current evidence suggests that the avian influenza viruses we're seeing circulating around the world do not spread easily to people – and the risk of avian flu to the general public remains very low.”

Chand added UKHSA was prepared for the detection of the virus in humans and would respond rapidly with NHS and other partners if needed.

Robin May, the chief scientific adviser at the Food Standards Agency said: “We are working very closely with [the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs], UKHSA and Food Standards Scotland following the discovery of avian influenza virus in a sheep in the UK.

“Our advice remains that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk to UK consumers since the H5N1 virus is not normally transmitted through food.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The IOC – which gave us 11 years to plan – must be nervous about the state of affairs

The 2032 Olympic Games loom for Brisbane residents with equal parts promise and fear.

On one hand, there is the opportunity to write Brisbane's name alongside some of the world's great cities.

On the other, a gnawing collective feeling that Queensland might just stuff it all up.

As the Queensland government prepares to announce another plan for new stadiums – the third in four years since Brisbane was announced as the 2032 host – the real issue is becoming clearer.

No one has bothered asking Brisbanites what sort of Olympic Games they want to host. Or if they want the Olympics at all.

Before the 2024 state election campaign, both major parties held focus groups that found broadly similar conclusions. People in Brisbane supported the idea of hosting the Olympics (those outside the capital largely did not), but no one wanted to spend significant public money or construction efforts on games venues, at a time when housing supply had reached a critical point.

The International Olympic Committee also seemed to recognise the risk it might be “on the nose” if a host city pressed ahead with expensive, unpopular construction plans.

The state government's solution last year – converting the suburban Queensland Sports and Athletics Centre into a boutique athletics venue – brought forth another, competing anxiety.

In Paris, games events were held with the backdrop of some of the world's most recognisable landmarks. In Los Angeles, the Olympic flame would be set alight atop the LA Coliseum. 
 QSAC, built in the 1980s for the Commonwealth Games, was built next to a cemetery. Across the road is a self-storage business and a liquidated furniture outlet. There is very little public transport nearby.

These contrasting worries – not spending too much money on new venues; not embarrassing ourselves alongside Paris and LA – are unlikely to be resolved by building a bigger, better stadium. They need a deeper reckoning.

The moniker of “Olympic city” does not, by itself, transform a place. The “Brown Snake” is not the Seine (though it is roughly the same colour). Bowen Hills is not Beverly Hills.

One of the things Brisbaneites lover about the city is that it is something other than a global metropolis. Those not born in Brisbane – but who choose to live here – often do so because it is “not Sydney”.

Hosting the Olympics is only going to be successful if it reflects Brisbane; not some half-baked imitation of a larger city with a functioning public transport network and a clear understanding of its identity.

The International Olympic Committee has been clear – it wants the Olympics to adapt to the host city; not the host city to alter itself for the Olympics.

But what is missing is a clear vision – from political leaders, from both sides of politics, who have tied themselves in knots and put planning years behind schedule – about what a Brisbane games looks like.

Does it look like paving the inner-city's largest green space to build a stadium so we are not, as the deputy premier Jarrod Bleijie said when launching the state's latest venues review, “embarrassed” when compared to LA and Paris?

Brisbane's reluctance to craft a games that is unique to the city – not just an imitation of a bigger one – speaks to a lack of political courage, vision and belief that our place is worthy of hosting the games.

The premier, David Crisafulli, has placed a great deal of capital in the idea that he's the sort of person who keeps his promise. On Tuesday, he's likely going to break a big one.

During the election campaign – knowing there was reluctance about the idea of building a new stadium – the new premier promised he would not. Instead there would be a 100-day venues review.

LNP figures have long contemplated the situation. Crisafulli can argue his position was to support the review; the experts have said there is a need for a new stadium; and so he is acting responsibly by following their advice.

But at the same time, the premier is also lobbying to ignore another key part of the venues review team's advice – that the state push ahead with plans to construct a $2.5bn inner-city arena.

Doing away with the arena would, as Crisafulli has argued internally, free up funding for the construction of a new stadium. It would also allow the state to talk about sporting legacy – building a purpose-built swimming centre, rather than an area with a temporary pool, would be a good outcome for the sport.

But all this is politically untenable. It's not possible to fall back on “taking the advice of experts” when you also ignore their advice when you want to do something else. The “broken promise” claims will follow Crisafulli until the next election.

Few voters, particularly in regional Queensland, will buy the idea of a new stadium even if the government tries to argue it has saved money in other places.

Should the IOC – which gave Brisbane 11 years to plan – be nervous about the state of affairs? There is enough time to get things back on track. But there is also little sign that any of the things that have derailed the process so far – provincial politics and the public unease – are going away any time soon.

Opponents of the Victoria Park stadium plan say they've briefed barristers and could launch a legal challenge. They have amassed significant high-profile support. Local Indigenous elders say they oppose use of the wetland site, known as Barrambin.

There is little doubt the IOC – when it devised its “new normal” process and awarded the games to a smaller city like Brisbane – had envisaged something other than bulldozing parkland and building concrete over First Nations cultural heritage sites.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Neurosafe procedure allows doctors to remove prostate while preserving as much nerve tissue around it as possible

A more precise form of prostate cancer surgery nearly doubles the chances of men retaining erectile function afterwards compared with standard surgery, according to the first comprehensive trial of the procedure.

Doctors in five UK hospitals assessed the surgical approach that aims to preserve crucial nerves that run through the outer layer of the prostate and are thought to be responsible for producing erections.

Known as NeuroSafe, the procedure involves checking prostate tissue removed from the patient while the operation is under way. If the examination suggests the tumour has been removed, the nerve-containing outer layer of the prostate can be left intact, reducing the patient's risk of erectile problems.

Prof Greg Shaw, the trial lead and a consultant urologist at University College London hospitals NHS foundation trust, said: “This procedure gives surgeons feedback during the surgery to give them the certainty they need to spare as many nerves as possible and give men increased hope of recovering their sexual potency after their cancer is surgically removed.”

Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in men in England, with 50,000 cases diagnosed each year. Worldwide, nearly 1.5 million men are diagnosed and 375,000 die annually. The disease is most common in over-50s and is often called a silent killer because it causes no symptoms in the early stages.

Recent developments in robotic surgery have allowed doctors to perform precision “nerve-sparing” operations in prostate cancer patients. This involves removing the diseased prostate while leaving the outer layers and the nerves running through them.

However, doctors must be sure that no cancer cells are left behind, and this can be difficult to assess. If the cancer is advanced, surgeons will err on the side of caution and remove the prostate with its outer layers to reduce the risk of missing any tumour cells and the disease returning.

In the NeuroSafe procedure, doctors remove the prostate while preserving as much nerve tissue around it as possible. Slices of the prostate are then frozen, stained and examined for cancer cells. If the tumour reaches the surface of the prostate, the outer layers and its nerves may need to be removed. But if the tumour stops short, the surgery is considered complete.

The trial assessed 344 men with prostate cancer who had no history of erectile dysfunction. Half received the NeuroSafe procedure and half underwent standard surgery. A year later, 56% of men who had standard surgery reported severe erectile dysfunction, compared with 38% who had NeuroSafe surgery.

Less than a quarter (23%) who had standard surgery reported no or only mild erectile dysfunction, compared with 39% who had the NeuroSafe procedure. Details were presented at the 2025 European Association of Urology congress in Madrid and are published in the Lancet Oncology.

Dr Matthew Hobbs, the director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “Prostate cancer surgery is a life-saving option for lots of men, but it's a major procedure that can cause side-effects like erection problems. A major challenge we face is how to cure men but also ensure they can live life to the full afterwards.

“This study is promising and provides evidence that innovative types of surgery can reduce erectile dysfunction in some men. However, more research is needed to prove whether NeuroSafe is as effective as traditional techniques at delivering a complete cure.

“We also need to understand exactly which men could benefit from this new technique and, crucially, whether this technique could be delivered at scale across the NHS to make it accessible to men across the UK.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Irish government also hits back at accusations by US that country is operating a ‘tax scam'

The Irish government has warned that the country could lose up to 80,000 jobs if Donald Trump launches a trade war with the EU, and has hit back at accusations by the US that Ireland is operating a “tax scam”.

The jobs estimate represents almost half the workforce in Ireland's multinational sector, which the US president is expected to target as part of an effort to repatriate jobs and taxes.

In the worst-case scenario, “it is very possible that between 50,000 and 80,000 jobs that would have been created or kept within the economy won't be”, Ireland's finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, told RTÉ.

The Irish government also responded to claims by the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, that Ireland was running a “tax scam”.

Ireland's enterprise minister, Peter Burke, said Lutnick, who had previously described Ireland's trade in goods surplus with the US as “nonsense”, was wrong.

“We have the most bilateral treaties, tax treaties as part of the EU as well. So we absolutely have no tax scams in this country. We're very clear in terms of transparency,” he told RTÉ, adding the country had led the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development revised tax agreement that increased Ireland's corporate tax rate from 12.5% to 15%.

Speaking on the All-In podcast, Lutnick was clear Dublin was in his sights. “We have to try and fix a whole bunch of these tax scams. Ireland is my favourite. The country of Ireland last year had a $60bn budget surplus. So [America] lose $2tn and they make $60[bn],” he said, significantly inflating Ireland's actual surplus.

In 2024, Ireland recorded a €25bn (£21bn) surplus that included the “transformational” Apple back tax windfall of €14bn – the result of a long-running tax battle.

Official government data showed Ireland last year operated a trade deficit with the US of almost €93bn when goods and services were taken into account. It included a trade surplus in goods of about €70bn but a deficit in services amounting to €163bn.

Trump has already said will introduce tariffs against the EU on 2 April, which he has described as “liberation day”.

In a meeting with Ireland's taoiseach in the Oval Office two weeks ago, he made it clear Ireland was in his sights, singling out the US pharmaceutical companies operating in Ireland that include Pfizer and Eli Lilly.

Experts say tax changes in the US could have more damaging impact on the life sciences sector in Ireland than tariffs, with manufacturers unlikely to close plants that take years of planning to open.

But other sectors that could be hit in collateral damage include alcohol. Trump has threatened a 200% tariff after the EU signalled it would add additional taxes to imports of US whiskey including Jack Daniel's and bourbon.

Ireland sells about €800m worth of alcohol to the US each year, more than half of which is Irish whiskey such as Jameson, Teeling and Connemara.

Last week a report by Ireland's Economic and Social Research Institute showed the Irish economy could shrink by up to 3.7% under the worst trade war scenario.

Former president hits out at sanctions against him but admits his criticism of Zelenskyy comes at a delicate time

In the corner of Petro Poroshenko's Kyiv office, a large poster shows him shaking hands with Donald Trump, back in the US president's first term when Poroshenko was his Ukrainian counterpart.

Those were happier times for Kyiv when it came to Trump: on the wall behind Poroshenko's desk hangs a certificate, signed by Trump's then secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in 2018, vowing that the US will not recognise the annexation of Crimea.

Now, as a newly emboldened Trump embarks on his second term, Russian control of Crimea is one of many concessions to Moscow his negotiating team is reportedly considering as part of their effort to end the war. And instead of friendly handshakes, Trump dressed down Poroshenko's successor as president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in the Oval Office last month, and appears bent on forcing Ukraine into concessions.

Poroshenko, looking on, felt that White House meeting was a “disastrous mistake” by Zelenskyy. He blamed Zelenskyy's team for failing to give him an accurate “psychological portrait” of Trump.

“He's not an easy person, undoubtedly. He's not Biden. He's not a person of values. He's a person of the deal. But you should be prepared for that, when … the future of your nation depends on the way you treat Trump,” said Poroshenko, in an interview with the Guardian.

He has been muted in his criticism of Zelenskyy since the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 but he says recent sanctions placed on him by the Ukrainian authorities have caused him to speak out. “This is an absolutely political decision of Zelenskyy: extrajudicial, no court, no rule of law, and even without explanation why it's happened,” he said.

The accusations come at a delicate time for Kyiv, when Trump and those in his orbit are accusing Zelenskyy of being a dictator and are demanding new elections. Most observers of Ukrainian politics say those claims are absurd and an election in wartime would be legally and logistically impossible. But many also note an increasing centralisation of power and see the sanctions against Poroshenko as politically motivated, even if polls suggest the former president is hardly a direct political threat to Zelenskyy.

The president's team denies that the charges have any political undertones, and many in Ukraine are irritated at Poroshenko for going public with criticism at a time when national unity is paramount.

Faced with this claim, Poroshenko agreed, but said it was Zelenskyy's fault for launching sanctions against him: “Ukraine is weak without unity and definitely Putin will use this opportunity to undermine the internal stability in Ukraine,” he said. Zelenskyy is not a dictator, said Poroshenko, but he is “leading the country towards dictatorship”.

A billionaire confectionery magnate who went into politics, Poroshenko was elected president after the Maidan revolution in 2014. When he stood for re-election in 2019, he lost resoundingly to Zelenskyy, whose main qualification for the job at that point was playing the president in a television series, but who accused Poroshenko of failing to reform the country or end the war with Russia in east Ukraine. “I am the result of your mistakes,” he told Poroshenko during an ill-tempered stadium debate.

The fractious campaign cemented a strong dislike between the two men. In 2021, Poroshenko was charged with high treason and aiding terrorist organisations, allegedly for conspiring with Russia-backed separatists early in his presidency to profit from coal sales. Many considered the charges as politically motivated.

When Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, the hatchet was temporarily buried. Poroshenko said he called Zelenskyy on the morning of the invasion and asked to see him. They later met at the presidential administration, as Russian troops headed towards Kyiv.

“I told him, ‘Mr Zelenskyy, you are not my opponent any more and I am not the leader of the opposition any more. We should save the country, we should save the nation, we should have one enemy and the name of the enemy is Putin. And his answer was, ‘I am very much happy to hear this,'” Poroshenko recalled.

That unity held for the first two years of the war. Poroshenko focused on his foundations that provides support to the military, and his faction in parliament toned down criticism of the government for the sake of wartime unity. Last month, however, the government placed sanctions on him and several other rich businessmen, freezing their assets, and now the gloves are off.

Recent reporting by Politico suggested that members of the Trump team had met Poroshenko and others in opposition to Zelenskyy, perhaps with a view to pushing for quick elections. Asked about which members of the Trump team he has met, Poroshenko said: “Many members, some publicly.” He declined to go into much detail, but recalled a meeting with Michael Waltz, Trump's national security adviser, before Waltz was appointed to the role.

“That was a very positive meeting, because the purpose of this meeting was to explain to him, to explain to them the current situation in Ukraine, not only the political one,” he said.

Poroshenko said he was “crystal clear” in his contacts with the Trump team that there could be no elections during wartime. But as soon as a deal to end the war was done, he said, Ukraine should “stop the martial law and prepare for the election”.

The sanctions mean Poroshenko has no access to his fortune; he can't even use a credit card in the supermarket, he said. Aides said that for now his foundation, which provides equipment to soldiers at the frontline, is still receiving hardware bought before the sanctions hit, but say they do not know what will happen afterwards.

According to Poroshenko, the main goal behind the sanctions is to stop him from running in elections. “Definitely part of it is personal hatred, this definitely exists. But this is just to clean up the political landscape … I cannot open the account for the election, and that's why this is an attempt to withdraw me from the election,” he said.

Polls suggest Poroshenko would have little chance of winning free elections, with a majority of Ukrainians still viewing him negatively, though he still has a constituency of support. He regularly polls in third place, behind Zelenskyy and the wartime commander Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the ambassador to London.

Many see Zaluzhnyi as a clear favourite to win any future vote, but it is not yet clear if he wants to stand. The freezing of Poroshenko's assets could also be a way to stop him from using his significant fortune to back another candidate, say some.

“I don't think the country is suddenly going to start loving Poroshenko. But this is a signal to all the others as well. Today it's Poroshenko, tomorrow it could be anyone else from big business,” said analyst Volodymyr Fesenko.

Zelenskyy aide Mykhailo Podolyak denied there was any political subtext to the sanctions and said they were a tool to stop those under criminal investigation from spiriting their money out of Ukraine.

“There are a large number of oligarchs targeted by these sanctions … The sanctions limit the possibility to remove resources from Ukraine. That's it. And then the investigations continue. On Poroshenko, they've been going on for several years, and I think everything will become clear in court,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The ruling is the latest twist in months of political turmoil since suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law declaration last year

South Korea's constitutional court has ruled against the impeachment of the country's prime minister, Han Duck-soo, and to restore his position as acting president, marking the latest political twist in months of political turmoil.

Han took over as acting president after the country's leader, Yoon Suk Yeol, was himself impeached over his short-lived declaration of martial law late last year.

Han lasted less than two weeks in the post and was impeached and suspended on 27 December after clashing with the opposition-led parliament by refusing to appoint three more justices to the constitutional court.

The court's justices ruled seven to one on Monday to strike down the impeachment.

Out of the eight justices, five said the impeachment motion against Han was valid but there were not enough grounds to impeach him as he did not violate the constitution or South Korean law concerning the martial law announcement or potential insurrection, according to a court statement.

Two justices ruled that the impeachment motion against Han, who was acting president at the time, was invalid from the start as two-thirds of lawmakers in parliament did not pass it. One justice voted to impeach Han.

Han, who resumed the acting presidency on Monday, thanked the court for its “wise decision”.

“I believe that all citizens are clearly speaking out against the highly polarised political sphere,” he said. “I think there is no place for division now. Our country's priority is to move forward.”

Han, 75, had served in leadership positions for more than three decades under five presidents, both conservative and liberal.

In a country sharply divided by partisan rhetoric, Han had been seen as a rare example of an official whose varied career transcended party lines.

Still, the opposition-led parliament accused him of not doing enough to thwart Yoon's decision to declare martial law, an accusation he denied.

The finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, assumed the position of acting president while the cases of Yoon and Han were considered by the constitutional court.

Parliament impeached Han over his alleged role in the martial law, as well as his refusal to appoint more justices to the constitutional court and to back special counsel bills targeting Yoon and the first lady, Kim Keon-hee.

Han attended the only hearing in the case on 19 February, where he denied any role in the martial law episode and called for the court to dismiss the impeachment.

South Korea's presidential office welcomed Han's reinstatement and said the ruling “reaffirms that excessive impeachments by the national assembly are reckless and malicious political offensives”.

“We hope that acting president Han's return to duty marks the beginning of a return to normal governance.”

The unexpected imposition of martial law on 3 December by Yoon and the ensuing political upheaval sent shock waves through Asia's fourth-largest economy, and drew concerns from allies such as the US, who had seen Yoon as a key partner in efforts to counter China and North Korea.

The martial law in the end lasted only about six hours after lawmakers voted to reject the declaration, after defying efforts by police and the military to seal off parliament, hopping fences to avoid the security cordons.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Shiv Sena party supporters tore apart the Habitat comedy club after Kunal Kamra's satirical song about a top minister

A mob violently ransacked a Mumbai comedy club and its building has been partly demolished after one of India's most prominent comedians performed a satirical song about a local ruling politician during a performance there.

Kunal Kamra has a reputation for his acerbic comedy which often pokes fun at political figures. Few comedians in India dare to make political jokes for risk of a backlash.

Kamra's standup routine, performed in Mumbai's well-known Habitat comedy club on Friday night, included a parody song about Eknath Shinde, the second most powerful figure in the Maharashtra state government.

The song referred to the deputy chief minister as a “gaddar”, meaning traitor, a reference to him switching his political allegiance in 2022 and helping to bring down the previous state government.

An online video of the routine prompted criticism from the leaders of Shinde's Shiv Sena party. On Sunday night about 20 Shiv Sena supporters descended on Habitat and began to smash it apart, throwing chairs, tearing down posters and breaking light fittings.

The police have arrested more than 10 people for the incident, including the leader of Shiv Sena's youth faction, Rahul Kanal.

The Shiv Sena-led government sought to blame Kamra for the violence. Maharastra's chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, claimed in the state assembly on Monday that people were free to perform standup comedy but added that “freedom of expression has its own limitations. You cannot insult anyone”.

“There is no need to spare them,” said Fadnavis. “We will not tolerate this and we will teach them a lesson.”

The state home minister, Yogesh Kadam, said the police were trying to trace Kamra and that the government would investigate his phone records and look into his bank account transactions to prove whether there was a “mastermind” or political conspiracy behind his jokes.

Shiv Sena said they had also filed a police report against Kamra.

Kamra did not directly respond to the allegations. However, hours after the attack he posted a picture on Instagram showing him holding up a copy of the Indian constitution on stage, captioned: “The only way forward … ”

Ministers also claimed that the Habitat comedy club was “illegal”. A demolition team from the local municipal council arrived at the venue on Monday and began demolishing part of the building on the grounds that part of it had been illegally constructed.

In a statement on Monday, the venue said it was “shocked, worried and extremely broken by the recent acts of vandalism targeting us. We have never been involved in the content performed by any artist”.

The venue said it was shutting down until “we figure out the best way to provide a platform for free expression without putting ourselves and our property in jeopardy”.

Comedians and comedy venues have increasingly been caught in the crosshairs of India's shrinking space for freedom of expression since the rise of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, which has ruled for more than a decade. In Maharastra, Shiv Sena rules the state government in coalition with the BJP.

In 2021, a Muslim comedian was detained by police for weeks for alleged “vulgar” jokes insulting Hindu gods despite never having performed at the show. In the same year, the comedian Vir Das faced a backlash and police reports after a comedy monologue that dealt with politically sensitive issues.

Opposition politicians in Maharashtra condemned the violence and retaliation against Kamra. Shinde's former political ally, Aaditya Thackeray, said “only an insecure coward” would react in such a way to a comedy song.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

People who suffer cardiac arrest are more likely to survive in Victoria than almost anywhere else in the world thanks to key interventions

There were no warning signs when teenager Austin Blight went into cardiac arrest.

The 17-year-old collapsed unconscious at the gym, where staff rushed to his aid and quickly realised he didn't have a pulse.

He survived because staff performed CPR and used an automated external defibrillator to shock his heart before paramedics arrived.

Since his medical emergency in 2024, Austin has returned to school to finish year 12 and is back working out in the gym.

He lives in Victoria, where residents are more likely to survive a heart episode than any other Australian state and almost any other place in the world.

Groundbreaking advances in response and survival rates across the state have been revealed in the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry annual report for 2023/24.

It found Victoria has the best cardiac survival rate in the nation, and the third-best in the world behind King County in the US and Denmark.

This is all thanks to early intervention, with bystander CPR administered in 79% of witnessed cases and 141 cases receiving a shock from a public automated external defibrillator (AED) – the highest number on record.

As a result of these interventions, and the work of paramedics and first responders, 422 cardiac arrest patients were discharged from hospital, with 84% returning home to their families.

Victoria has more than 7,500 publicly accessible defibrillators, significantly improving the survival rates for cardiac arrest patients, who without CPR or defibrillator intervention have only a 5-10% chance of survival.

Ambulance Victoria's free GoodSAM app, which alerts people to someone in cardiac arrest nearby, is also making a difference with 17,327 registered responders and 793 cases attended by volunteers in the last year.

Integrated with the triple-zero emergency service, the app connects patients with registered volunteers who can provide CPR and defibrillation until an ambulance arrives.

Ambulance Victoria's director of research and evaluation, Dr Ziad Nehme, praised the collective effort that led Victoria to its highest internationally comparable rate of 41% of patients surviving to hospital discharge.

The rise from 36% in 2022/23 marks the largest annual increase in the past decade.

“These improvements in survival are not by chance,” Nehme said. “When CPR and defibrillation are provided quickly, survival chances increase significantly.”

Ambulance services minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, said it was impressive to see Victorians going out of their way to help others in need.

“Minutes matter in cardiac arrests and when a patient receives CPR and defibrillation before paramedics arrive, their chance of survival increases significantly,” she said on Monday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Commitment may quell caucus angst about party's environment credentials, but could face backlash from Western Australia's industry and government

Labor has vowed to establish a federal environment protection agency if it wins the election, just weeks after the 2022 election promise was shelved amid a political and industry backlash in Western Australia.

The public commitment will help placate Labor MPs anxious about the party's green credentials after the government went ahead with laws to protect Tasmania's salmon industry from legal challenge over its impact on the endangered Maugean skate.

Labor's environment caucus committee needed three meetings between Friday and Sunday night to finally reach agreement on the legal intervention.

Labor MPs wanted guarantees a re-elected Albanese government would deliver a promised overhaul of environment protection laws before signing off on the pro-salmon farming legislation.

Sign up for Guardian Australia's breaking news email

Caucus endorsed the legislation on Monday morning, clearing the path for it to be pushed through parliament this week with the Coalition's support.

In a statement on Monday night, a government spokesperson confirmed a second-term Labor government would establish a federal EPA as part of a wider fix to Australia's “broken” environment laws.

Labor made the same promise before the 2022 election, part of a response to a review of Australia's federal environment laws from former ACCC boss Graeme Samuel that was given to the Morrison government.

At the time Plibersek promised a set of “national standards” to underpin the watchdog that all conservation plans and policies would adhere to – shifting responsibility on to a legislated body rather than a politician.

In February of this year, Albanese had insisted Labor was not abandoning environment protection reforms after he pushed laws to establish the nature watchdog off the agenda in February.

Monday night marks the first time Labor has explicitly re-committed to a federal EPA as part of its second-term agenda.

The commitment will help assuage internal unease about Labor's environment record but likely provoke fresh blowback in WA, where a federal EPA remains deeply unpopular with industry and the WA government.

Government sources have confirmed Labor would consult state governments, environment groups and industry on a new watchdog model, rather than seek to revive the one it failed to pass this term.

The EPA was just one part of Labor's wider package of nature-positive reforms, which included plans for national environmental standards.

“Our environment laws are broken,” a government spokesperson said.

“They don't protect the environment adequately, nor do they give businesses timely decisions or protect workers and communities they live in. Only a Labor government will fix this.

“It's disappointing that the Greens party worked with the Liberals in the Senate to block the establishment of an independent EPA after it passed the House of Representatives in July 2024.”

The government plans to amend the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act to end a formal reconsideration by the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, into whether an expansion of fish farming in Macquarie Harbour in 2012 was properly approved.

The industry, Tasmanian Labor MPs and state Liberal government have lobbied for the change.

The reconsideration was triggered by a legal request in 2023 from three environmentally focused organisations.

The government stressed the laws were drafted with the specific purpose of protecting Tasmanian salmon workers, as it moves to hose down fears it could be applied to fossil fuel projects.

“We won't stand by and let workers in (Tasmanian's) Strahan lose their livelihoods because of a broken law,” the government spokesperson said.

“Under existing law, an industry could be shut down overnight when an environmental assessment commences. That is not acceptable to the government or to the community.

“This is a very specific amendment to address a flaw in the EPBC Act. The existing laws apply to everything else, including all new proposals for coal, gas, and land clearing.”

The Coalition, which was briefed on the laws for the first time on Monday, is expected to back the intervention after months demanding Labor protect the salmon industry.

The shadow environment minister, Jonno Duniam, said Labor can not claim credit for “saving” Tasmanian salmon jobs, given Plibersek agreed to the review of the 2012 decision.

Speaking before the caucus meeting on Monday, Albanese said Labor “makes no apology for supporting jobs”.

“What we know is that the environmental science tells us that the skate is at the same levels that it was back a decade ago. We responded to the science to provide certainty,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Wide gulf remains between US and Russian expectations for a ceasefire; US envoy dismisses UK PM's Ukraine plans as ‘a posture and a pose'. What we know on day 1,125

A US delegation will seek progress toward a Black Sea ceasefire and a broader cessation of violence in the war in Ukraine when it meets for talks with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia on Monday, after discussions with diplomats from Ukraine on Sunday. The White House says the aim of the talks is to reach a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, allowing the free flow of shipping.

A wide gulf remains, however, between the US' and Russia's expectations, with US envoy Steve Witkoff signalling hope for “real progress” and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warning that “difficult negotiations” lie ahead. “I think you're going to see in Saudi Arabia on Monday some real progress, particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries,” Witkoff told Fox News. “And from that you'll naturally gravitate to a full-on shooting ceasefire.” Peskov meanwhile told Russian state TV, “We are only at the beginning of this path.”

Witkoff dismissed UK prime minister Keir Starmer's attempts to rally peacekeepers in Ukraine as “a posture and a pose.” He said the idea was based on a “simplistic” notion of the UK prime minister and other European leaders thinking: “We have all got to be like Winston Churchill.”

The US envoy also praised Vladimir Putin, saying he “liked” the Russian president and did not “regard Putin as a bad guy”. “That is a complicated situation, that war, and all the ingredients that led up to it.” He added that Putin was “super smart” and believed he wanted peace.

Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration was aiming to secure a broad truce agreement between Russia and Ukraine by Easter. The White House is aiming for a truce agreement by 20 April – Easter Sunday in both the western and orthodox churches this year. But sources told the news organisation that the date was likely to slip.

Ukraine's defence minister, Rustem Umerov, said on social media talks with the US delegation were “constructive and meaningful” and focused on key issues, including the energy sector. Trump has previously suggested the US could control Ukraine's nuclear power facilities.

At least seven people were killed in a barrage of strikes from more than 140 drones across Ukraine on Sunday, according to local Ukrainian officials and emergency services. The sound of explosions were heard in the early hours of the night across the capital, Kyiv, as the air raid continued for more than five hours. Russian drones and debris from shot-down drones, which were flying at lower altitudes to evade air defences, fell on residential buildings across the Ukrainian capital. At least one child was among those killed.

Russian troops reportedly seized the small village of Sribne in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, while Ukraine's army said its troops had recaptured the small village of Nadia in the eastern Luhansk region.

Rebellion fuelled by violent tactics of Pakistani military has become increasingly sophisticated

No one knows how Kamran Hasan became a militant. The history-loving 23-year-old had returned home from Islamabad, where he worked as a chartered accountant, and had his hopes set on a degree in education. But then in June, he disappeared. A brief phone call to his father came days later.

“He told me, ‘I am going to the mountains,'” says his father, Mohammad Akram, who knew that meant only one thing: his son was joining the militant insurgency that had rocked their home region of Balochistan for decades. “I begged him no, asked if it was reasons of money or family that led him to take this step. But he did not give any more details and disconnected the call.” Hasan's friends also had no answers.

Hasan's story has become an increasingly familiar one in homes across Pakistan's troubled south-western region of Balochistan, the country's largest and poorest province, which borders Iran and Afghanistan.

The insurgency in Balochistan is almost as old as the country itself. It began in 1948 when the region was controversially – some say forcefully – annexed to become part of the newly formed Pakistan. Violent separatist uprisings, which were largely tribal-led, took place again in 1958, 1962 and 1973.

In the early 2000s the violence took a turn. Baloch nationalists, who had long accused the Pakistani state and military of exploiting Balochistan's valuable mineral resources, oppressing its people and rigging its elections, began to mobilise into organised insurgent armies that called for an independent Baloch state.

For years it remained a low-intensity operation, marked by sporadic attacks and ambushes. Yet in recent years, the long-festering insurgency has gathered a lethal new momentum. Baloch militants – often in vast numbers – began to carry out sophisticated attacks on high-profile Pakistan military targets and multimillion-dollar Chinese projects . They also started using suicide bombers.

Young men and women in their hundreds – some estimate thousands – began to bolster the ranks of militant groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA). Increasingly, those radicalised were educated graduates from middle class families with no militant connections. The BLA has also become highly media savvy, sending out coordinated press releases about their attacks and posting videos across X, TikTok, Telegram and Instagram glorifying their violence.

The newfound scale and ambition of the Baloch insurgency became starkly apparent this month, as the BLA carried out one of its most high-profile attacks yet. Hundreds of Baloch militants blew up railway tracks and hijacked a passenger train carrying almost 500 passengers as it travelled through the remote mountains of Balochistan, taking hundreds hostage.

The Pakistani government claimed that 31 people were killed overall, and that the military operation took out 33 Baloch insurgents. But the BLA called the claims “a lie” and said they had executed 214 hostages who were mostly military and police personnel onboard the train. With secrecy surrounding the Pakistan military's operation and very few of the rescued hostages seen in the aftermath, both accounts were impossible to independently verify, leading to questions about the true scale of the death toll on either side.

Watching the news of the train hijacking unfolding, Hasan's father was unable to sleep for days, fearful that his son was among the militants responsible. “We keep switching on TV and scrolling social media to know about the attackers,” he says. “I am haunted by the fear he is among those killed.”

It was followed days later by another deadly BLA attack, as suicide bombers attacked a convoy of paramilitary forces in the city of Noshki. In 2024 alone, the BLA claimed responsibility for 302 attacks, including a bombing at Quetta's main railway station that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers.

“Since around 2017 we have seen a massive escalation, not just in the levels of violence but the lethality, the complexity, the military skill and the geographical scope of the Baloch insurgency,” says Asfandyar Mir, an expert in South Asia counter-terrorism at the United States Institute of Peace. “It's clear there is a high level of resolve to sustain the fight.”

The surge of violence has helped push Pakistan's security situation to its most precarious in more than a decade. Baloch militants have become highly visible across the province, frequently blocking roads, setting up checkpoints and attacking police and military posts, forcing the army and paramilitary to stay confined in their camps.

This month, senior government ministers and army leaders held a special meeting to discuss the country's deteriorating security crisis.

Public support for the Baloch resistance – both violent and non-violent – has been growing, particularly among the younger generation, with vast numbers turning out to recent protests. Many continue to be radicalised in response to the ongoing human rights horrors inflicted in Balochistan by the army and paramilitary for about two decades – an anti-insurgency crackdown and the crushing of dissent, known as Pakistan's secret dirty war, that has led to thousands of activists, journalists, students and civilians in the region being abducted, tortured and then killed or rarely seen again.

According to Voice for Baloch Missing Persons, since 2009 almost 1,500 of the “disappeared” have turned up dead, often in a beaten state, and another 6,000 remain missing. Since the insurgency was revitalised, human rights groups have reported an increase in extrajudicial killings and disappearances once again. The military denies any involvement.

There has also been a widespread loss of faith in finding political solutions to Balochistan's problems, after credible allegations of military interference in the last two elections in 2018 and 2024 which brought down popular Baloch nationalist politicians.

“Violence has become the dominant form of interaction between the state and the Baloch, sidelining and undermining political avenues for addressing the issues,” says Sajid Aziz, a researcher into the Baloch insurgency.

Ayoub Azim was 21 when he was abducted, along with his best friend, by the security forces along in 2017. He was kept in a dark cell and tortured, despite having no links to militant groups. When he was eventually released two years later, Azim tried to get over the trauma and got married, with his wife quickly falling pregnant. But months later, he disappeared to join the ranks of the BLA.

“As a family, we tried to stop him but he refused and said he only wanted to take revenge,” says his father-in-law, Uzair. Azim returned briefly to see his daughter two years ago. The next the family heard of him was that he had been killed last March carrying out a suicide attack on a naval base.

In 2017, the BLA – now the most prominent Baloch separatist group – also began to undergo a transformation. In the decade previous, the brutality of the military's crackdown was deemed largely successful in bringing the Baloch insurgency under control. However, this began to shift when the BLA began to reorganise and brought in founder Aslam Achu Baloch as their commander-in-chief.

Under Aslam Baloch's leadership, the BLA moved away from its powerful tribal leaders to become a more educated middle class movement. He revitalised the Majeed brigade – the elite squad of suicide bombers – and established intelligence and operative wings within the BLA. The infighting and division between the BLA and other insurgent groups was also largely brought to an end after a coalition of separatist groups was formed in 2018.

Afghanistan is also seen to have played a critical role in fuelling Baloch militancy. Mir says it had gone “under-appreciated how much the Baloch outfits have benefited from the return of the Taliban”, who came back to power in Afghanistan in 2021 and have an increasingly hostile relationship with Pakistan.

It is widely acknowledged that the current BLA commander-in-chief, Bashir Zaib, has been freely living in Afghanistan, just as his predecessor Aslam Baloch did. Afghanistan is also believed to have provided a crucial training ground for BLA militants, with evidence suggesting BLA fighters have trained in camps alongside the Pakistani Taliban.

This was reiterated by a senior security source in Pakistan who say they have traced direct coordination and logistic support between the BLA and Pakistani Taliban, particularly in training for suicide bombers. They also allege the BLA militants were using American weapons left behind in Afghanistan. In a press conference last week, the military alleged the train hijacking was coordinated from Afghanistan.

Pervez Saleem, the former chief secretary of Balochistan, says the renewed insurgency and its widespread support should serve as a wake-up call for Pakistan's military.

“They think they can keep Balochistan by force but it can't happen any more. The geopolitical situation has changed and the army needs to change its policies. There's a new great game at play.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Group received emails about Ahsan Mansur, the central bank official investigating money laundering allegations

British MPs believe they may have been targeted by a “disinformation” campaign aimed at discrediting the man leading efforts to trace funds allegedly laundered from Bangladesh into the UK.

MPs raised the alarm after receiving emails about Ahsan Mansur, who was installed as the central bank governor of Bangladesh last year, after a student-led revolution swept away the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina.

Mansur has been in London seeking help from the government and private companies to track down billions of dollars in assets allegedly stolen by allies of the Hasina regime, some of which he believes may have been used to buy UK property.

His visit has already been overshadowed by an escalating row involving Hasina's niece, the former City minister Tulip Siddiq, who resigned from the role this year after Dhaka's anti-corruption commission (ACC) filed a criminal case against her. She has denied all wrongdoing.

Now MPs fear that Britain's efforts to assist Bangladesh could be further clouded by an apparent smear campaign against Mansur involving news articles by fake journalists.

MPs in the 47-strong all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on responsible tax and corruption received emails before a session on Monday with Mansur. The sender, who claimed to be a journalist, sent links to a website called International Policy Digest, featuring articles about apparent displays of wealth by Mansur's daughter and questioning why she was not being investigated.

Neither of the articles' supposed authors appears to have any other profile as a journalist. The Guardian found that pictures of them were actually stock images.

Mansur and MPs on the committee raised concerns that the emails were part of a concerted disinformation campaign.

Mansur, a former IMF official, who previously lived and worked in Washington, said he believed that people under investigation for money laundering were trying to “diminish my reputation and target me in various ways”.

He added that his daughter was a US citizen who had little to do with Bangladesh.

One APPG member, Rupa Huq, received a separate email from a UK public relations firm called Palatine Communications, also linking to International Policy Digest.

The email said that if Mansur was prepared to “impugn the integrity of Tulip Siddiq” then he and his family should also face scrutiny.

Mansur said he had never made any comments about Siddiq.

However, he is a key figure in the transitional government led by Mohammad Yunus, whose ACC accused Siddiq, along with her family members, amid an investigation into a 2013 deal with Russia that allegedly overinflated the price of a nuclear power plant.

Huq said it was “highly unusual” to receive such an email and compared it to demonstrations that have targeted her speaking about Bangladesh in parliament. She said both were “designed to intimidate and interfere with parliament and MPs' normal work”.

Members of the APPG are understood to have referred the emails to parliamentary cyber security advisers, as well as to the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, which is investigating disinformation.

“If it is the case that this communication is an attempt to mislead UK politicians when it comes to a very serious corruption scandal, then I think we should be very concerned,” said APPG member Phil Brickell.

“I urge the relevant parliamentary authorities to investigate thoroughly – we must get to the bottom of who paid for this, and why, in order to understand how we can best protect ourselves.”

A spokesperson for Palatine Communications said: “Our client instructions are confidential. In sending the email in question, we acted on our own initiative.

“We have nothing to do with, and know nothing of, the authorship of this article, but nor did we ever claim it represented the gospel truth. Like numerous articles from many media outlets, it raises legitimate concerns about the current situation in Bangladesh that we believe are worthy of MPs' consideration.”

A spokesperson for International Policy Digest said the person who had actually written the articles had “wished to remain anonymous”, adding that they were confident that the content was “fairly accurate”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Rami Battikh, 24, got caught up in five-year nightmare after stolen ID card was used in string of crimes

A young German citizen has told how his life has been destroyed after a London criminal used his ID to rack up a string of convictions that now appear on the German database against his name.

The phantom record has left the 24-year-old in despair, effectively blacklisted and unable to get a job for the past four years in his native Bonn, stymying a budding career and the start of his adult life.

Rami Battikh has written to the Metropolitan police in London begging them to treat the matter with urgency telling them he feels trapped and powerless after years of futile effort to get the the record deleted.

The mix-up has been described by a British judge as a “mess” that has left a terrible stain on a German national's record.

Battikh's nightmare began following a short holiday in London in 2019. He had travelled with his passport and German national identity card but discovered on return his ID card was missing or stolen.

He did not think too much about it, applied for a new ID card and two years later finished his vocational apprenticeship at Vodafone finance in Bonn.

Battikh, a dual German Tunisian national, was soon offered two jobs, one with Vodafone and the other with the local tax office.

But his excitement turned into an ongoing Kafkaesque nightmare after a routine employer check showed he had a criminal record in London.

“I couldn't believe it. I told my employers that it was not true that for sure it was not me, that I had proof I wasn't in the UK at that time as I was in Tunisia at the time and had stamps on my passport to prove it.

“But they just said they couldn't just take my word over a police record,” said Battikh.

His sister Rebecca said: “We have a saying in Germany if you are in shock or scared, your heart drops in your trousers. That's how he felt.”

The issues started in March 2021 when another man fraudulently using Battikh's ID was jailed by Wood Green crown court in London for 18 months for a series of offences including driving without a licence or insurance, fraud by false representation, and possession of a false, improperly obtained identity document belonging to another person.

The mix-up was first picked up by a judge, now retired, in Wood Green crown court after Battikh hired a solicitor.

Emails seen by the Guardian show his successor, Judge Dodd, tried to get the Met to rectify the error in 2022, describing it as “mess” that had stained the German national's record.

As efforts to persuade the Met that its database entry was incorrect continued without success, Battikh's nightmare worsened. Fourteen months later more crimes were recorded against his stolen ID in London including possession of a knife in a public place.

When he discovered his so-called criminal record had lengthened he thought his life was over.

“I was in disbelief, I thought what is wrong with the UK? They have already said I am not the criminal and my ID was stolen because the court confirmed this. But why can they not delete my name from the record. I was really upset,” he said.

Last year he wrote to the Met, which appear to be the authority that can change criminal records, but still has not had his name cleared.

“I cannot continue to live like this, waiting indefinitely for a criminal record to be cleared. It is incomprehensible that this process has been ongoing for six months with no successful resolution.

“Please, what would you do if you were in my shoes, feeling trapped and powerless because of mistakes beyond your control. I feel utterly desperate,” he said.

At 24 he has no prospect of a job, has had to sell his car to cover bills, and is now sharing his story because he does not know what to do.

In April 2024 he wrote to Wood Green crown court, the only place he thinks is taking him seriously in England, offering DNA or fingerprints which he had taken at a German police station for transfer by Interpol.

“This fraud destroys my life. I can't get any jobs. Please if you need I will give you my fingerprints, a hair strand … I can't live like this any more. I am innocent and I never did any of those criminal acts I beg for help,” he wrote to the court.

In a statement the Met said: “We are aware of this case and we continue to work with other agencies to progress this with a view to having the situation rectified. We understand that the length of time this has taken has added to the concern and upset, but aim to provide an update to the applicant in the near future.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Exclusive: Australia's top green organisations suspend anti-nuclear power ads to fund campaign against Labor's move to protect salmon industry

Australia's leading environment organisations have abruptly suspended advertising campaigns attacking the Coalition's plan to introduce nuclear power and are instead funding ads accusing Anthony Albanese of signing “the death warrant” of an endangered species.

The shift from criticising Coalition to Labor policy on the cusp of an election campaign was agreed by the bosses of green groups – including the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace and WWF Australia – at what campaigners described as an emergency meeting on Saturday.

It reflects widespread anger within the environment movement about Albanese's plan to rush through legislation this week with Coalition support to protect the salmon industry from a long-running legal challenge over its impact on the endangered Maugean skate.

One person at the meeting said the mood was “apoplectic” over what was seen as a rushed government plan to weaken national environment law. They said it followed the prime minister having intervened to shelve a commitment to create a national Environment Protection Agency in this term of parliament.

The campaign is notable in part because most environmental organisations would strongly prefer that Labor returns to government, whether in minority or majority, to a Peter Dutton-led Coalition taking power. Many of the anti-nuclear ads have also been strongly supportive of Labor's renewable energy policies.

An Australian Conservation Foundation social media ad posted on Saturday said: “Australia's next extinction is imminent and our PM is signing the death warrant. Not on our watch”. A Greenpeace Australia Pacific ad said: “Albanese goes all out for species extinction”.

The chief executive of Greenpeace Australia Pacific, David Ritter, said there was “visceral anger in the community” about a change to nature laws to prioritise an industry over scientific concerns about the skate, which had survived for more than 60m years. He said environmental advocacy groups agreed to a coordinated advertising approach “to ensure that the prime minister grasps the seriousness of the situation”, after direct lobbying failed.

“Like many other groups, Greenpeace has immediately refocused campaign effort to ensure the Australian public is aware of what the prime minister is proposing to do and the impact it would have – not just on the Maugean skate, but setting an incredibly bad precedent giving special treatment to a harmful and polluting industry,” he said. “In our own advertising, this issue has taken priority over gas and nuclear policy, for now.”

Ritter said campaigners believed it was not too late for Albanese to change course. “The bill should be dumped and a strong re-commitment should be made to deliver strong nature law reforms, and an independent watchdog to enforce them, within the first 12 months of government if reelected this year,” he said.

Other conservation group leaders told the government the suspension of their anti-nuclear advertising was “open-ended”. Some were reconsidering where they would dedicate resources during the campaign.

The government plans to amend the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act to end a formal reconsideration by the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, into whether an expansion of fish farming in the harbour in 2012 was properly approved. The industry, Tasmanian Labor MPs and state Liberal government have lobbied for the change.

The reconsideration was triggered by a legal request in 2023 from three environmentally focused organisations. An environment department opinion released under freedom of information laws suggested that it could lead to salmon farming having to stop in the harbour while an environmental impact statement was prepared.

Guardian Australia has learned the legislation would prevent reconsideration requests by third parties in some cases in which developments had been deemed “not a controlled action” – meaning they had not needed a full federal environmental assessment. It would apply when the development was ongoing or recurring, had been under way for at least five years before the request was made, and was subject to state or territory oversight.

A government spokesperson said on Sunday the proposed change was a “very specific amendment to address a flaw” in the EPBC Act.

“We won't stand by and let workers lose their jobs because of a broken law. Under existing law, an industry could be shut down overnight when an environmental assessment commences. That is not acceptable to the government or to the community.

“We want to see laws which provide better environmental protections and faster decision-making. We remain committed to that. We will consult on specifics in a second term with the states, business and environment groups.”

The Maugean skate has been listed as endangered since 2004. Concern about its plight escalated last year when a government scientific committee said numbers in the wild were “extremely low”, and that fish farming in the harbour was the main cause of a substantial reduction in dissolved oxygen levels and should be scaled back or removed to save the species. It recommended the species be considered critically endangered.

A separate report by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies last month said surveys suggested the skate population was likely to have recovered to 2014 levels after crashing last decade. It stressed the need for continued monitoring.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Scientists say widespread damage to both world heritage-listed reefs is ‘heartbreaking' as WA reef accumulates highest amount of heat stress on record

Australia's two world heritage-listed reefs – Ningaloo on the west coast and the Great Barrier Reef on the east – have been hit simultaneously by coral bleaching that reef experts have called “heartbreaking” and “a profoundly distressing moment”.

Teams of scientists on both coasts have been monitoring and tracking the heat stress and bleaching extending across thousands of kilometres of marine habitat, which is likely to have been driven by global heating.

On the Great Barrier Reef, bleaching is being detected from around Townsville to the tip of Cape York, a distance of about 1,000km.

On Western Australia's famous Ningaloo reef, waters have accumulated the highest amount of heat stress on record during an extended marine heatwave that has hit coral reefs all along the state's vast coastline.

Paul Gamblin, the chief executive of the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said history would “record this profoundly distressing moment” when two world famous reefs both suffered widespread damage at the same time.

Dr Zoe Richards, an associate professor and coral scientist at Curtin University, spent 10 days monitoring the health of Ningaloo reefs and the neighbouring Exmouth Gulf earlier this month.

She said in shallower areas known for their clear waters, which are popular with tourists, she had seen up to 90% of corals bleached and evidence of corals dying. Even slow-growing corals that were hundreds of years old were bleaching, she said.

Ningaloo last experienced widespread bleaching only three years ago.

The WA government, which is coordinating monitoring across reefs there, said bleaching had also been reported at Kimberley, Ashmore Reef, Rowley Shoals, Barrow Island, Dampier Archipelago, inshore Pilbara and Exmouth Gulf.

Richards said: “This isn't isolated to Ningaloo – this is happening across the entire north-west shelf. There has never been this scale of impacts in WA. I am not aware of this ever happening before. Climate change has definitely caught up with the reefs in WA.”

Corals lose the algae that give them their colour and most of their nutrients if ocean waters get too warm. If bleaching is not severe, corals can recover, but studies show they are less able to reproduce and are more susceptible to disease.

Coral reef experts use a metric known as degree heating weeks (DHW) to show how much heat corals have accumulated. Generally, corals begin to bleach at about 4DHW, and 8DHW can kill heat-sensitive corals.

Dr Jessica Benthuysen, an oceanographer at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims), first saw signs of heat accumulating in WA last August. By the end of December, she said, some areas had sea surface temperatures 4C hotter than normal.

Benthuysen said levels up to 16DHWs had been detected on the Ningaloo coast, which were the highest on record.

The US government's Coral Reef Watch says DHWs between 12 and 16 are enough to cause coral death across multiple species.

The federal government's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has coordinated monitoring flights over northern reefs, finding low to high levels of bleaching on most reefs. Underwater checks found bleaching at 24 of 30 reefs surveyed.

Bleaching was worse farther north – there is no concern for reefs in the park's southern section.

Last summer was the worst bleaching event on record for the reef and the fifth major outbreak in eight years, hitting all across the marine park.

Dr Neal Cantin, a coral reef biologist at Aims who was on the monitoring flights, said bleaching was generally worse closer to shore but there was “high to medium” bleaching on reefs from Cairns to the far north. He said in the far north, heat stress was between six and 13DHWs, which was “capable of causing mortality”.

Dr Roger Beeden, the chief scientist at the authority, said detailed analysis of the data from the flights was still being analysed, but he said the lack of recovery time for corals between major events was worrying.

“It's the frequency as well as the severity that makes us most concerned,” he said.

Dr Emily Howells, a coral scientist from Southern Cross University who has been at the Australian Museum's research station on Lizard island since February, said this was now the sixth summer in a row that bleaching had been seen there.

The island, in the north of the reef, was badly hit by bleaching last summer and scientists at Aims who visited in subsequent months said the area had lost one-third of its live corals due to the heat.

Howells said there was less coral mortality this year, “but that's because a lot of the sensitive corals died last summer”.

“There just isn't enough opportunity for these coral communities to bounce back. It's heartbreaking,” she said.

“We're making it more and more challenging for the corals. The solution is having stronger action on climate change. The longer we wait, the worse it will get.”

Northern parts of the Great Barrier Reef have also been heavily affected by flooding from torrential rains. James Cook University's TropWATER group has recorded flood waters carrying sediments and nutrients in a plume across 700km of the coast and extending as far as 100km offshore.

Jane Waterhouse, a reef water quality expert at TropWATER, said major flood events appeared to be happening more often and flood plumes were reaching farther offshore.

“River discharge carries pollutants, sediments and nutrients,” she said. “You get muddy water that cuts the light that seagrass and corals need to grow, and that nutrient also allows algae to grow.”

Gamblin said the widespread damage from underwater heatwaves and cyclones to both reefs was “what our world-renowned scientists have been warning us about for decades”.

He said fossil fuel companies were “doubling down” to get more mega projects running, pointing to areas around Scott Reef in WA being targeted for expansion by Woodside.

He said: “More mega polluting projects up at places like Scott Reef will make a tragic situation worse. What will our children say to us?”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

New Zealand will return to the World Cup for the first time in 16 years after overcoming early nerves to beat New Caledonia 3-0 and book a place in Canada-Mexico-USA.

The Kiwis were made to work in their Oceania playoff, held goalless in the first half and losing captain Chris Wood to a hip injury early in the second.

New Caledonia provided stern resistance for an hour before Michael Boxall broke through, the 36-year-old scoring his first international goal when New Zealand needed it most.

Kosta Barbarouses doubled New Zealand's lead soon after, allowing for a national exhale, before Eli Just wrapped up the result in the 80th minute.

New Zealand will make their third appearance at the World Cup finals, cashing in on Fifa's decision to offer the tiny Oceania confederation a confirmed place at the 2026 tournament.

But for an hour at Auckland's Eden Park, it was agony for the Kiwis.

Led by Nottingham Forest striker Wood and with a generationally-talented squad, New Zealand thumped Fiji 7-0 in their semi-final on Friday and were expected to be far too strong for New Caledonia, the world No 152.

But early on, the All Whites played without intensity or fluency, unable to fashion strong chances.

New Caledonia goalkeeper Rocky Nyikeine – also in goal the last time Les Cagous beat New Zealand, in 2012 – was in fine form, denying the Kiwis at set pieces and in general play.

He kept out early efforts from Callum McCowatt and Wood and gratefully received help from defender Joseph Athale, who headed clear off the line twice in one frenzied backs-to-the-wall moment.

Despite his Premier League pedigree, Wood never looked on song, even mis-volleying one effort backwards.

The All Whites looked flabbergasted at half-time as they walked off the pitch at 0-0, while New Caledonia's XI gathered in a circle – not quite celebrating, but their belief clearly building.

Johan Sidaner's band of amateurs and semi-professionals, almost entirely made up of either locally-based players or those from the lower tiers of French football, had never been one match from the World Cup before.

Sydney FC's Jaushua Sotirio, an unused substitute in both their matches, was the sole pro, accepting a call-up to the nation of his parents' birth given the carrot of World Cup qualification.

Adding to their disadvantage, the New Caledonia Super Ligue has been paused since last year owing to major civil unrest which claimed more than a dozen lives and devastated the capital, Noumea.

Their stirring shift in Auckland had its first setback in the 61st minute, when substitute Frances de Vries sent a cross to the back post for Boxall to head home.

New Zealand's oldest player was joined on the scoresheet by the second-oldest, Barbarouses, five minutes later, effectively sealing the contest.

The 35-year-old raced onto a through-ball from Wellington Phoenix teammate Payne and chipped over Nyikeine, then turned provider for Just to thrash home a third.

New Zealand ran out the match without their captain and vice-captain, with Wood off and Liberato Cacace needing a late substitution, though both were fit enough to revel after the final whistle.

Wood and Tommy Smith are the only current Kiwis to have played at a World Cup, the 2010 tournament in South Africa.

While New Caledonia missed the direct qualification slot, they could still be the smallest and lowest-ranked nation to head to a World Cup.

They will be Oceania's entrant in an inter-confederation playoff next year, when they will reprise their underdog role as six nations compete for two places.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The drone attack on Kyiv killed a father, his 5-year-old daughter and an 80-year-old woman, the first fatalities in Ukraine's capital in more than two months.

KYIV — Nearly 150 Russian drones descended on Ukraine early Sunday, rattling Kyiv awake just after midnight to the boom of explosions, which killed three people and injured 10 — deepening tensions ahead of ceasefire talks continuing this week in Saudi Arabia.

Among the victims were a father and his 5-year-old daughter, and an 80-year-old woman who neighbors said could be heard screaming for help after her ninth-floor apartment caught fire. The fatalities were the first in Kyiv in more than two months, and on Sunday, the Ukrainian flag atop the 335-foot-tall Motherland Monument was lowered to half-staff as a symbol of mourning.

“New solutions are needed, new pressure on Moscow, so that such strikes and this war stop,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on Telegram on Sunday.

In preparation for technical talks this week in Saudi Arabia, Zelensky's office has been preparing a list of civilian infrastructure — including ports and railways — to be spared from future strikes. While Ukraine has supported a comprehensive ceasefire without preconditions, as proposed by the United States, Russian President Vladimir Putin last week agreed only to a narrow proposal barring strikes on energy infrastructure. In recent days, both sides have accused the other of violating the limited agreement, threatening to derail the ongoing negotiations.

After Russian drones struck the Ukrainian port city of Odessa on Friday, and then its Zaporizhzhia region — killing three people in a family of four, leaving the oldest daughter the only survivor — Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Kyiv of having a “lack of desire to achieve peace.” The Kremlin blamed Ukraine for the explosion of an oil depot in Russia's Kuban region and an attack on a gas metering station in Sudzha, a town in western Russia seized last year by Ukraine and recently retaken by Russia.

Zakharova's comments came Saturday as Czech President Petr Pavel was on an official visit to Kyiv, where he toured Okhmatdyt Hospital — a children's hospital struck by a Russian missile in July — with Ukraine's health minister, learning about the impact of the war on the country's medical infrastructure, which the health minister said has seen 1,984 medical buildings damaged and 301 destroyed.

Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff appeared Sunday on Fox News, where he repeated Putin's false claim that parts of eastern and southern Ukraine were Russian because of illegal referendums held in 2022.

“There's a view within — within the country of Russia that — that these are Russian territories, that there are referendums within these territories that justify these actions,” Witkoff said. “This is not me taking sides.”

Witkoff did not acknowledge that the referendums were staged and held under military occupation, with some residents saying they were forced to vote under threat. In 2022, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution calling on Russia to reverse course on the “attempted illegal annexation” of the territories — which the Kremlin did not heed.

On Sunday morning, the carnage of the morning's attack was still evident in Kyiv. Rescue workers in Kyiv amassed outside one of the apartment buildings struck in the morning attack. The roof was scorched black and gouged open to the sky, insulation tufting from the walls. Men cut tarp to cover the broken windows, and the Red Cross poured tea and plated sugar cookies for residents.

Up several flights of stairs, where broken glass crunched underfoot, Vasyl Komarov, 49, watched water from the fire hoses upstairs drip from the ceiling and collect in brown puddles on the floor. His mattress was thrown against the wall, and in the living room, a cone-shaped indent of concrete jutted from above the window — the strike site.

“We will survive it,” said Komarov, who had grown up in the apartment and inherited it from his parents. “The good thing is my arms and legs are still attached. … In the evening, this is all going to hit me.”

He knew his upstairs neighbor in Apartment 36 hadn't been as lucky. Although 80 years old, she had continued working as a cleaner at a nearby children's center — maintaining her independence, even though she sometimes relied on her neighbors' help to navigate her cellphone or the television remote.

Her apartment had been directly hit, smoke painting the front hallway black, possessions incinerated past the point of recognition. Even her mattress had been reduced to bedsprings.

“Everyone tried to open the door, but it was burning like crazy,” said her neighbor Olena Zhilina, 57, who had been tasked with calling the woman's son in Sumy with the news.

She acknowledged the morning's grief — but it was also just another day of war.

Mayor Anne Hidalgo has floated a plan to “revegetate” 500 Parisian streets to make the city more liveable. Critics say it would deepen divides between urbanites and commuters.

Parisians cast their ballots Sunday over an ambitious proposal floated by the mayor that would block 500 streets to road traffic and replace miles of asphalt with plants and trees, in a poll that will serve as a key test of people's willingness to support climate policies even if they might have a disruptive impact on daily life.

While the proposal's supporters say the program will make the city more livable and help combat climate change, critics say the changes will make the city more difficult to navigate and further fuel the divide between Parisians and those who live in the suburbs.

“With this vote, Parisians have the choice of whether or not to accelerate Paris's adaptation to climate change, the fight against pollution and the improvement of the living environment within 300 meters of their homes,” Mayor Anne Hidalgo said in an Instagram post.

It could also be a last chance for Hidalgo, who has been mayor of Paris since 2014 and said she will not seek reelection next year, to advance major plans for the city. That's particularly true of her vision for a “15-minute city,” in which residents can reach essential resources by foot, bicycle or public transport within a quarter of an hour. These plans have grown in popularity worldwide — and especially in Europe — as more cities struggle with rising temperatures and air pollution tied to climate change.

The vote, which will take place until 7 p.m. local time, is nonbinding, meaning it is advisory, and results are expected late Sunday.

Residents over the age of 16 are eligible to take part. Voters will be asked to green-light, in principle, the addition of five to eight new green and pedestrianized streets in each neighborhood within Paris's 20 districts.

It's the third vote on the city's transportation policies organized by Hidalgo, after Parisians voted in 2023 to ban e-scooters for hire and last year to impose a new fee on SUVs and other particularly polluting vehicles.

If the proposal passes, the city plans to identify which streets should be eligible and carry out public consultations and feasibility studies, in work that could last up to three years.

This has led critics to argue that the city is asking residents to vote on a plan that could majorly affect their neighborhoods without providing specifics as to what, exactly, they are voting for.

“Paris is holding a vote ‘for or against the greening of 500 streets.' Okay, but how can we decide without any background information?” asked Guillaume Rozier, who advises French President Emmanuel Macron on digital issues, in a post on X. Rozier added that the city had not provided enough information on the projected costs, impact on mobility and type of vegetation to be installed.

Critics also argue that the vote encourages a focus on symbolic numbers over meaningful progress toward green goals: For example, they say freshly planted trees do not provide the same environmental benefits as older trees, whose foliage has fully developed, and say there should be more of a focus on protecting established trees.

City Hall did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post on Sunday.

During her tenure, Hidalgo has radically altered the flow of traffic within Paris in an effort to reduce air pollution and fortify the city against climate change, including by building more than 340 miles of new bicycle lanes and removing tens of thousands of outdoor parking spots — resulting in a more than 40 percent decrease in car traffic since 2011, according to city data.

Hidalgo's moves have earned her acclaim overseas, but they have been more controversial at home, with critics accusing her of deepening disparities between Parisians living inside the city within easy access of public transportation and those living in suburbs or further out who must drive in and out of the city for work.

Her political support has receded in the city and nationally: When she ran for president in 2022, she got only 1.75 percent of the vote — the lowest score in the history of the Socialist Party — and only a little over 2 percent of the votes in Paris.

Hidalgo's supporters want to avoid making Sunday's vote about her legacy and instead have framed it as a vote for the future of the city. In an interview with local media Friday, Anouch Toranian, Hidalgo's deputy for community life, said it was a chance for Parisians to express support for “calmer streets, with fewer cars on pedestrianized streets, and therefore more calm, less noise nuisance and less pollution.”

Prime Minister Han Duck-soo returned as acting president, pledging to protect South Korean interests amid the Trump trade war and manage “geopolitical upheaval.”

SEOUL — South Korea's Constitutional Court reinstated Prime Minister Han Duck-soo as acting president Monday, overturning the National Assembly's vote to impeach him and returning him to office during an extraordinary time of political turmoil.

The court has not, however, given a date for its highly anticipated ruling on the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was suspended from his duties after briefly imposing martial law on Dec. 3, a move that put Han — for a short time — in the acting president role.

Tens of thousands of protesters — both supporters and opponents of Yoon — filled the streets of Seoul over the weekend as both sides urge the court to make a decision and — one way or another — bring about an end to the prolonged political crisis.

That, however, seems unlikely in a deeply polarized country.

Separate from the Constitutional Court's impeachment hearings, Yoon is facing a criminal trial on charges that he led an insurrection when he ordered martial law troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from gathering there in December. He denies the charges.

Local media are calling this week a “super week” of landmark rulings because the Supreme Court is due to decide Wednesday on an appeal by Lee Jae-myung, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party and front-runner to win a presidential election if Yoon is removed from office, against his conviction for an violating election law.

“This is one of those weeks where history does change,” said Joung W. Hwang, a lawyer and former law professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “Korea is definitely at an inflection point. There's no doubt about that.”

After Yoon was impeached on Dec. 14, Han took over the role of acting president. But lawmakers in the opposition-dominated National Assembly alleged Han was involved in Yoon's plans to declare martial law.

Han denied that, testifying that Yoon told him less than two hours before the decree that he had intended to declare martial law. A technocratic career public servant who has served in liberal and conservative administrations, Han said he disagreed with Yoon and convened a cabinet meeting to try to persuade the president to change his mind.

Han was nevertheless impeached in a National Assembly vote on Dec. 27, and finance minister Choi Sang-mok took over as the third leader in a month.

Choi saw the country through its worst aviation disaster just days later, then the return of President Donald Trump, who has levied tariffs that threaten South Korea's manufacturing industry and questioned whether the United States is paying too much to defend allies like South Korea.

But opposition parties, unhappy with Choi's actions on appointing more judges to the Constitutional Court, submitted a motion on Friday to oust him, too — the 30th Democratic Party-led impeachment motion since Yoon took office in 2022.

They had 72 hours to bring the motion to a vote, but their efforts were overtaken by the Constitutional Court's decision to reinstate Han.

The back-to-back efforts to impeach the nation's top leaders have created a leadership crisis during a critical time.

Han promised Monday to use his remaining time in office to protect South Korea's interests in the face of Trump's trade war and to navigate the “geopolitical upheaval” that has taken place since he returned to the White House.

“I sincerely request bipartisan efforts so that South Korea can overcome the current crisis and move forward and upward,” Han said in a speech Monday.

Some conservatives — and Yoon's office on Monday — have accused the Democratic Party of abusing its power by moving to impeach political figures in the president's orbit.

Analysts have also warned it could set a dangerous precedent in which parties overuse impeachment proceedings as a means to fight their political opponents and paralyze the opposition.

“When there's a party where the majority can temporarily remove people from office, that can be a remarkably destabilizing power,” said Benjamin Thompson, a political science professor at Kyungpook National University in Daegu. “There's no guarantee that only this party will do it in the future, either.”

But some conservative figures and protesters have been driven by baseless conspiracy theories, some involving election fraud.

“Korea has historically had this sort of standard, partisan divide,” Thompson said. “What's different this time is the counter protests on the street, the level of online activism and the apparent increase of some elements of extremism in these protests, which I find to be a little disconcerting.”

That political instability has also led to increased division and tension in South Korea, with near-daily protests in the center of Seoul, culminating in the weekend's rival rallies.

Lawmakers and citizens have been shaving their heads in public and embarking on hunger strikes. One Yoon supporter died of injuries he sustained after setting himself on fire.

Law enforcement officials are preparing for potential social unrest on the day of the Yoon ruling. Thousands of riot police officers will be deployed to the court and its surrounding areas in case of violence or attacks on the court facilities, police officials said. Schools in the vicinity of the court are planning to shut down on the day of the ruling.

If the court decides to remove Yoon from office, Han would remain the caretaker head of state until a presidential election is held, within 60 days. If Yoon's presidential powers are restored, he would return to office immediately, and Han would continue to serve as prime minister.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The toll from Gaza's Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Experts say it is probably an undercount.

More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip, the enclave's Health Ministry said Sunday — a grim indicator of the conflict's continued lethality less than a week since Israel shattered a nearly two-month-old ceasefire, launching airstrikes and ground incursions into the territory.

Israel launched the war in Gaza in response to the deadly Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed about 1,200 people and took roughly 250 people hostage. Most of those hostages have been released through negotiated exchanges, and of the 59 Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza, 24 were believed to be alive before the conflict resumed.

Despite over a year of heavy bombardment of a strip of land of roughly 140 square miles, Israel has been unable to completely destroy Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007.

The two parties agreed to a ceasefire in January that paused hostilities and saw 33 Israeli hostages exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli detention. The first phase of what was supposed to be a three-phase path to a permanent end to the war lapsed on March 1, and the parties could not agree on an extension of that phase.

While Hamas wanted to immediately open talks for the second phase, in which Israel would fully withdraw from the enclave and Hamas would release remaining living hostages, Israel refused to engage in those talks and instead opted to extend the ceasefire.

Israel began bombing Gaza again Tuesday, breaking the fragile truce. The renewed Israeli attacks have killed more than 673 people since then, Gaza's Health Ministry said midday Sunday, more than a third of whom were children. An additional 233 people who were killed previously were added to the count of the dead after a committee tracking the missing confirmed their deaths, the Health Ministry added.

Many of the casualties over the past week have been women and children, according to medical workers and eyewitnesses.

In a joint statement on Sunday evening, the Israel Defense Forces and Shin Bet intelligence service said they had hit Gaza's Nasser Hospital in an airstrike, targeting a Hamas official who they said was operating in the hospital compound.

Israeli military and intelligence officials said the strike was carried out following “an extensive intelligence-gathering process.” Gaza's Health Ministry said the hospital attack caused a big fire, and a surgery building was targeted. Videos posted on social media by Palestinian media showed at least one level of the hospital aflame.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the hospital attack killed Ismail Barhoum, who he said was acting as prime minister in Gaza. Hamas confirmed  reports of Barhoum's death, saying he was receiving treatment at the hospital at the time. It was unclear what role, if any, Barhoum had in the group's military operations. Palestinian media reported that he was a member of Hamas's political bureau and head of the financial department in Rafah.

The Health Ministry said Sunday evening that at least two people were killed in the Nasser Hospital attack, including a 16-year-old boy who was recovering from surgery two days earlier. Medical staff were among the injured, and a large part of the surgical department was destroyed, it said.

Strikes last week targeted senior Hamas political figures, killing acting prime minister Essam al-Da'alis and high-ranking officials in the Hamas-run justice and interior ministries.

Among the 41 people killed between Saturday afternoon and late Sunday morning was senior Hamas leader Salah al-Bardawil, a member of the movement's political bureau, who was killed overnight, according to a statement from Hamas. The statement, which described the attack as an “assassination,” said Bardawil was killed alongside his wife when an Israeli airstrike hit his tent in Mawasi, an area of Khan Younis, as the couple were praying.

In a joint statement earlier Sunday, the IDF and Shin Bet  said they carried out the strike that killed Bardawil, describing him as the head of Hamas's “planning and development office.” It was unclear what role, if any, he had in the group's military operations.

Ibrahim Madhoun, a Palestinian political analyst who is close to Hamas, said Sunday that Bardawil was not involved in the activities of the group's military wing. He called Bardawil, who previously served as spokesman for the Hamas bloc in the Palestinian Legislative Council, a “symbol” within the movement and said his death was a “great loss.”

Also Sunday, the IDF said its troops had encircled the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood in Rafah in southern Gaza. “During the night, the troops encircled the area, eliminated several terrorists, and conducted a targeted raid on a terror infrastructure site that was used over the past few months as a command and control center of Hamas terrorists,” the statement said.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society said Sunday morning that it had lost contact with a team of paramedics trapped in Rafah and was “awaiting clearance” to try to reach the group. Gaza's civil defense force later said some of its crews were stuck in the same area after trying to rescue the Red Crescent staff and that they had also gone silent. Some 50,000 people living in the area encircled by Israeli troops faced “imminent danger” to their lives, the civil defense said.

The IDF said it was allowing civilians to evacuate, and an image Sunday showed families fleeing toward central Gaza, lugging babies, pillows and their few possessions by foot or  cart.

Sunday also marked three weeks since Israel blocked all aid from entering Gaza in an effort to force Hamas to compromise. The siege has reversed progress made during the ceasefire — which brought a surge of aid into Gaza — toward alleviating the dire humanitarian crisis there.

“Every day without food inches Gaza closer to an acute hunger crisis,” Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, wrote on X. “Banning aid is a collective punishment on Gaza: the vast majority of its population are children, women & ordinary men.”

Mediators have scrambled to drag the two sides back to the negotiating table, but current and former officials said the intensity of the renewed Israeli airstrikes has complicated their ability to revive a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

The Gazan Health Ministry's  figure of 50,021 killed since Oct. 7, 2023, does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but the ministry  says the majority of the dead are women and children. More than 113,000 people have been injured, according to the Health Ministry.

The Washington Post could not independently verify the ministry's figures; Israel has not allowed international journalists into Gaza since the start of the war. But Palestinian journalists, first responders, international aid workers and war-casualty watchdogs all say the official death toll in Gaza is probably an undercount, with the chaos of war upending what experts and researchers say was once a robust reporting system for tracking and identifying the dead.

During the nearly two-month ceasefire in Gaza, some people managed to recover the bodies of loved ones trapped beneath the rubble, but thousands more remain unaccounted for, according to Gaza's civil defense.

Alon Rom, Lior Soroka and Rachel Pannett contributed to this report.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that has been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff raised hopes of “real progress” on a Black Sea ceasefire in Monday's peace talks in Riyadh.

After President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff raised hopes of “real progress” on a Black Sea ceasefire in Monday's peace talks between United States and Russian negotiators, the Kremlin played down hopes for rapid progress, saying that numerous questions remain to be resolved.

The talks in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, were focused on technical aspects of monitoring a 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure, after  each side accused the other of breaches and following a U.S. effort to broaden the ceasefire to include Black Sea navigation.

Witkoff told Fox News on Sunday that he expected “some real progress, particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries. And from that, you'll naturally gravitate into a full-on shooting ceasefire.”

But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov raised Russia's complex demands around the 2022-2023 Black Sea grain initiative, a further sign that Moscow's tactic may be to carefully slow the peace negotiations without outright rejecting them, while maintaining its hard-line conditions for a full ceasefire.

Russia abandoned the grain deal in July 2023, claiming its demands were never met.

“In general, of course, there are many, many different aspects of the settlement to be worked out,” Peskov said. He said the Black Sea initiative “in its past form implied the fulfillment of a number of obligations to the Russian Federation, but they were not fulfilled.”

During 2023 negotiations on the Black Sea grain initiative, Russia claimed that its agricultural exports were being blocked by the West, despite not being under sanction. Western exemptions also allowed for payments to a Russian bank for agricultural products.

But after Russia's 2023 decision to abandon that deal, Ukraine continued to export grain through the Black Sea, avoiding the threat of Russian strikes by hugging waters closer to the shore.

Kyiv, meanwhile, has carried out strikes on Russia's Black Sea fleet vessels using its own sea drones, and it claims to have destroyed a third of the Black Sea fleet, including the flagship vessel Moskva. Russia has used its vessels in the Black Sea to launch cruise missile strikes on Ukraine.

Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent Russian pro-Kremlin foreign policy analyst, reflected Russia's satisfaction about the Trump administration's handling of the talks,  writing on Telegram that “everything is going according to the Russian scenario.”

He said Russian President Vladimir Putin's success in deflecting Trump's demand for a full ceasefire was part of Russia's tactics to slow the peace talks.

“The Kremlin has blunted the White House's momentum generated by the Jeddah talks and has turned the discussion into a lingering one,” he wrote, referring to a meeting this month when Ukraine accepted the United States' proposal for a full ceasefire. “Moscow believes that it is in its own interests right now,” he wrote, adding that the initiative on the battlefield was “on Russia's side.”

A document prepared last month for the Kremlin, written by an influential Moscow-based think tank close to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), said that “a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crisis cannot happen before 2026” and discussed the need for “the complete dismantling” of the current Ukrainian government.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova also played down hopes of swift progress Monday.

“It is necessary not so much to wait for breakthroughs but to understand that work is going on a number of directions. This is one of them,” she told Russian media Monday.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday underscored Moscow's continued hard-line stance when he said Russia will pay “constant attention [to] the solution to the problem of denazification of the state that remains under the control of the Kyiv regime.”

Russia has used this formulation as part of its drive to remove President Volodymyr Zelensky and his government, claiming he is illegitimate.

The U.S. delegation at Monday's talks was led by Andrew Peek, a senior director at the White House National Security Council, and Michael Anton, a senior State Department official, Reuters reported.

A member of Russia's negotiation team gave away little in comments to media during a break in Monday's talks. Grigory Karasin, a Russian senator who spent decades in the Foreign Ministry and was in charge of the Ukraine portfolio, said the negotiations were “going on creatively.” He said that “an interesting discussion on quite pressing subjects is going on.”

Asked about the possibility of an agreement in Monday's talks, Karasin said: “Not all negotiations necessarily yield some major documents and agreements. It's important to maintain contact all the time and understand each other's standpoint. That's what we've managed to do.”

Witkoff in Sunday's Fox News interview drew controversy when he repeated Putin's false claim that parts of eastern and southern Ukraine were Russian because of widely criticized referendums held in 2022.

“There's a view within — within the country of Russia that — that these are Russian territories, that there are referendums within these territories that justify these actions,” Witkoff said. “This is not me taking sides.”

Witkoff did not acknowledge that the referendums were staged and held under military occupation, with some residents saying they were forced to vote under threat, at times in their homes in the presence of heavily armed soldiers.

In October 2022, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling on Russia to reverse course on the “attempted illegal annexation” of the territories, weeks after Putin signed an decree illegally claiming to annex the regions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The leader of the rebels who captured two key cities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo says international sanctions and the planned minerals deal that the country has offered the US will not stop the fighting between their members and Congolese forces in the hard-hit region.

With such sanctions and a bounty placed on the rebel leaders by the Democratic Republic of the Congo's government, “we will fight like people who got nothing to lose in order to secure the future of our country,” Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance (AFC) that includes the M23 rebel group, told The Associated Press.

Mr Nangaa also dismissed Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi's comments last week that his country is looking for a minerals partnership with the US that will bring peace and stability for both countries.

Since launching a major escalation of their decade-long fighting with the Congolese forces in late January, the M23 rebels have captured the cities of Goma and Bukavu and several towns in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, forcing thousands of soldiers to either flee or surrender and prompting fears of regional warfare involving neighbours whose militaries are also on the ground.

Most of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's mineral resources, estimated to be worth 24 trillion dollars (£18.5 trillion) and critical to much of the world's technology, remain untapped, according to the US Department of Commerce last year.

The US government has not publicly spoken about any minerals deal being planned with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which local observers say could be similar to the Trump administration's offer for Ukraine to help end the war with Russia.

“This problem can be better resolved by the concerned Congolese, not foreigners with different geopolitical agendas,” Mr Nangaa told The AP over the weekend.

“Trying to bribe US with mines can undermine US credibility.”

Efforts to achieve a ceasefire collapsed last week after the rebels pulled out from talks being facilitated by Angola, condemning European Union sanctions on its leaders.

Mr Nangaa also rejected the outcome of a meeting between Congolese and Rwandan leaders in Qatar, saying such a move to achieve peace without the group's involvement would fail and that the rebels can only have a dialogue with the Democratic Republic of the Congo's government if the country acknowledges their grievances and the root causes of the conflict.

“Anything regarding us which are done without us, it's against us,” Mr Nangaa said.

Despite calls for a ceasefire, M23 rebels have now seized the key town of Walikale which gives them control of a strategic road linking four provinces in eastern Congo — North Kivu, South Kivu, Tshopo and Maniema — effectively cutting off Congolese army positions.

In seizing more territories beyond Goma — the only city they captured during their short-lived uprising in 2012 — the rebels aim to “secure” citizens in those places and fight the root causes of the conflict, the rebel leader said.

The most potent of about 100 armed factions vying for control in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, M23, is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who failed to integrate into the Congolese army.

The group says it is defending ethnic Tutsis and Congolese of Rwandan origin from discrimination.

Although UN experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces supporting the rebels in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mr Nangaa said the rebel alliance is independent and seeks to address “the root cause of more than 30 years of instability in our country”.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Danish police sent extra personnel and sniffer dogs to Greenland as the icy island steps up security measures ahead of a planned visit this week by US second lady Usha Vance, the chief spokesman for Denmark's national police said.

Rene Gyldensten said on Monday that the extra officers, deployed the day before, were part of regular steps taken during visits by dignitaries to Greenland, a self-governing, mineral-rich territory of American ally Denmark.

Citing office procedure, they declined to specify the number of extra police flown on the chartered flight.

News reports put the number at dozens of officers.

Ms Vance's visit comes at a time when President Donald Trump has suggested the US should take control of Greenland.

Greenlandic news outlet Sermitsiaq posted images of two US Hercules workhorse military aircraft on the tarmac on Sunday in Nuuk, the capital, adding that the planes later departed.

Ms Vance will leave on Thursday and return on Saturday, a statement from her office said.

She and one of her three children will be part of a US delegation that will “visit historic sites” and “learn about Greenlandic heritage”.

On her visit, Ms Vance will attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race, featuring about 37 mushers and 444 dogs.

The statement said Ms Vance and the US delegation “are excited to witness this monumental race and celebrate Greenlandic culture and unity”.

Media outlets in Greenland and Denmark reported that Ms Vance would be accompanied by Mr Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz.

The White House and the National Security Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Mr Trump had mused during his first term about buying the world's largest island, even as Denmark, a Nato ally, insisted it was not for sale.

The people of Greenland have also firmly rejected Mr Trump's plans.

Since returning to the White House, Mr Trump has repeatedly said that the US will come to control Greenland while insisting he supports the idea for strategic national security reasons — not with an eye toward American expansionism.

A high-profile US delegation will visit Greenland this week as President Donald Trump continues to threaten to annexe the strategic Danish territory.  Usha Vance, wife of vice-president JD Vance, will lead the delegation that includes White House national security adviser Mike Waltz and energy secretary Chris Wright.  Mr Waltz and Mr Wright plan to visit the Pituffik space base, the US military base in Greenland.

On Sunday, second lady Usha Vance posted a video to her SLOTUS Instagram account announcing her upcoming trip to Kalaallit Nunnaat, Greenland, to attend a dog sled race. The video features the 39-year-old standing in front of a mantel in a room with limited decor.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -An oil products spill occurred at the oil depot that caught fire in southern Russia's Krasnodar region after a drone attack last week, regional officials said on Sunday.  The area of the fire at the depot near the village of Kavkazskaya increased to 2,000 square metres from the 1,250 square metres previously reported, said state news agency TASS.  There were no casualties and other buildings and tanks at the depot were not damaged, regional officials wrote on messaging app Telegram.

Greenlandic leaders criticised a planned trip this week by a high-profile U.S. delegation to the semi-autonomous Danish territory that President Donald Trump has suggested the United States should annex.  The delegation, which will visit a U.S. military base and watch a dogsled race, will be led by Usha Vance, wife of Vice President JD Vance, and include White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

Second lady Usha Vance is heading to Greenland to learn about the territory's heritage, a move that follows President Trump's claim that the U.S. should acquire it. Vance will travel to Greenland on Thursday with her son and a U.S. delegation until Saturday, her office announced. During the visit, the second lady will “visit historical…

Greenland's people are bracing for another visit from U.S. President Donald Trump's inner circle, with second lady Usha Vance set to travel to the autonomous Danish territory this week as her husband ratchets up talk about U.S. security and “territorial” interests in the vast Arctic island coveted by the administration.  Greenland's prime minister warned Sunday of “American aggression” and lamented a “mess” caused by the upcoming visit from Vance, who will be accompanied by Trump's national security adviser and energy secretary.  The same day, Vice President JD Vance — her husband — blasted Denmark for “not doing its job” and ""not being a good ally.""

Greenland's prime minister said a planned visit to the island by US officials, including second lady Usha Vance, is “highly aggressive,” plunging relations to a new low after President Donald Trump vowed to annex the autonomous Danish territory.

US and Russian negotiators sat down for talks in Saudi Arabia on a partial ceasefire in Ukraine, hours after a round of negotiations between US and Ukrainian negotiators, Russian news reports said.

The state Tass and Ria-Novosti news agencies said the negotiations began in Riyadh.

The meeting is expected to be followed by another contact between US and Ukrainian teams.

The separate meetings are set to discuss details of a pause in long-range attacks against energy facilities and civilian infrastructure and a halt on attacks in the Black Sea to ensure safe commercial shipping.

Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle on Wednesday to a limited ceasefire after US President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders, but the parties have offered different views of what targets would be off-limits to attack.

While the White House said “energy and infrastructure” would be covered, the Kremlin declared that the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure”.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he would also like railways and ports to be protected.

Russia launched a barrage of drones across Ukraine overnight into Sunday that killed at least seven people, including a father and his five-year-old daughter in Kyiv.

“There must be more pressure on Russia to stop this terror,” Mr Zelensky said in a statement, adding that it “depends on all our partners — the US, Europe, and others around the world”.

Mr Zelensky has emphasised that Ukraine is open to a full, 30-day ceasefire that Mr Trump has proposed, while Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a complete ceasefire conditional on a halt of arms supplies to Kyiv and a suspension of Ukraine's military mobilisation — demands rejected by Ukraine and its Western allies.

Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Mr Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said he expected “some real progress” at the talks in Saudi Arabia, “particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries, and from that you'll naturally gravitate into a full-on shooting ceasefire”.

As for Sunday talks in Riyadh between Ukrainian and US representatives, Mr Zelensky said they had been conducted on a more “technical level” compared to similar meetings last week, this time involving representatives from Ukraine's military, energy ministry and diplomatic corps.

“Our team is working in a fully constructive manner, and the discussion is quite useful. The work of the delegations continues,” Mr Zelensky said.

“But no matter what we're discussing with our partners right now, Putin must be pushed to issue a real order to stop the strikes, because the one who brought this war must be the one to take it back.”","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Japan's official cherry blossom spotters confirmed the first blooming of the country's favourite flower, declaring the official start of the festive season in the Japanese capital.

An official from the Japan Meteorological Agency carefully examined the specimen tree of Somei Yoshino variety at Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine and announced that more than five blossoms — the minimum required for the announcement — were flowering on it.

The opening matched the average year and was five days earlier than last year, according to the JMA.

Cherry blossoms, or “sakura”, are Japan's favourite flower and usually reach their peak in late March to early April, just as the country celebrates the start of a new school and business year.

Many Japanese people enjoy walking or picnicking under the trees.

Sakura have deeply influenced Japanese culture for centuries and have regularly been used in poetry and literature, with their fragility seen as a symbol of life, death and rebirth.

The announcement in Tokyo, which is enjoying warmer-than-usual temperatures of around 19 Celsius (66 Fahrenheit), comes just one day after the blooming of the nation's first cherry blossom was confirmed Sunday in the south-western city of Kochi on the island of Shikoku.

The JMA tracks more than 50 “benchmark” cherry trees across the country.

The trees normally bloom for about two weeks each year from first bud to all the blossoms falling off.

They are expected to reach their peak in about 10 days.

Cherry trees are sensitive to temperature changes and the timing of their blooming can provide valuable data for climate change studies.

In recent years, Japan's cherry blossom season has tended to come earlier than the average, prompting concerns of a possible impact of climate change.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

US airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels pounded sites across the country, with the group saying the one attack in the capital killed at least one person and wounded more than a dozen others.

The American strikes entered their tenth day without a sign of stopping on Monday, part of a campaign by US President Donald Trump targeting the rebel group that threatens maritime trade and Israel while also trying to pressure Iran, the Houthis' main benefactor.

So far, the US has not offered any specifics on the sites it is striking, but Mr Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz claimed the attacks have “taken out key Houthi leadership, including their head missileer”.

That is something so far that has not been acknowledged by the Houthis, though the rebels have downplayed their losses in the past and exaggerated their attacks attempting to target American warships.

“We've hit their headquarters,” Mr Waltz told CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday.

“We've hit communications nodes, weapons factories and even some of their over-the-water drone production facilities.”

An apparent US strike on Sunday hit a building in a western neighbourhood of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, killing at least one person and wounding 13 others, the rebel-controlled Saba news agency said, citing health officials.

Footage released by the rebels showed the rubble of a collapsed building and pools of blood staining the grey dust covering the ground.

A building next to the collapsed structure still stood, suggesting American forces likely used a lower-yield warhead in the strike.

The Houthis also described American airstrikes targeting sites around the city of Saada, a Houthi stronghold, the Red Sea port city of Hodeida and Marib province, home to oil and gas fields still under the control of allies to Yemen's exiled central government.

The campaign of airstrikes targeting the rebels, which killed at least 53 people immediately after they began on March 15, started after the Houthis threatened to begin targeting “Israeli” ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip.

The rebels in the past have had a loose definition of what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning other vessels could be targeted as well.

The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting ships from November 2023 until January of this year.

They also launched attacks targeting American warships, though none have been hit so far.

The attacks greatly raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decadelong stalemated war that has torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Turkish authorities detained several journalists from their homes, a media workers' union said, calling it a crackdown amid growing protests triggered by the jailing of Istanbul's mayor, a top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

A court on Sunday formally arrested mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and ordered him jailed pending a trial on corruption charges.

His detention on Wednesday sparked the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade, deepening concerns over democracy and the rule of law.

The Disk-Basin-Is union said at least eight reporters and photojournalists were detained in what it called an “attack on press freedoms and the people's right to learn the truth”.

It called for their immediate release.

The social media platform X, formerly Twitter, said it was objecting to multiple court orders from Turkish authorities to block more than 700 accounts, including of news organisations, journalists and political figures in Turkey.

– Hundreds of protesters detained

A total of 1,133 people have been detained since the mayor was arrested at his home, interior minister Ali Yerlikaya said.

As many as 123 police officers were injured in the protests, he said, adding that materials such as acid, firebombs and knives were seized.

“Some circles have been exploiting the right to assemble and demonstrate, attempting to disrupt public order, incite street unrest and attack our police,” Mr Yerlikaya said on social media.

The minister said some of the detained were identified as having ties to groups listed as terrorist organisations and others had criminal records.

Hundreds of thousands of people have come out for the largely peaceful protests across Turkey in support of the mayor.

There has been some violence, with police deploying water cannons, tear gas and pepper spray and firing plastic pellets at protesters in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir.

Some protesters hurled stones, fireworks and other objects at riot police.

– Mayor urges more rallies

In a message on social media, Imamoglu urged people to rally outside city hall and other locations for a sixth night on Monday.

He also called on youths to avoid clashes and asked police to treat demonstrators with kindness.

“I'm working hard, I will work even harder. Where I am does not matter,” he said.

The mayor's jailing is widely regarded as a political move to remove a major challenger to Erdogan from the next presidential race, scheduled for 2028.

Government officials reject the accusations and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently.

Imamoglu was jailed on suspicion of running a criminal organisation, accepting bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and bid-rigging — accusations he has denied.

A request for him to be imprisoned on terror-related charges was rejected although he still faces prosecution.

The Interior Ministry later said Imamoglu had been suspended from duty as a “temporary measure”.

The municipality previously appointed an acting mayor from its governing council.

Imamoglu was taken to Silivri prison, west of Istanbul, as more than 1.7 million members of his opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, held a primary election, endorsing him as its presidential candidate.

Millions of non-members also cast votes in a “solidarity ballot,” the party said.

Alongside Imamoglu, 47 other people were also jailed pending trial, including a key aide and two district mayors from Istanbul.

One was replaced with a government appointee. A further 44 suspects were released under judicial control.

– Ankara municipality also under scrutiny

Meanwhile, authorities were investigating the office of Ankara's mayor, another popular opposition figure, over the alleged misuse of public funds concerning the organization of 33 concerts, the municipality said on Monday.

It said the decision was made even though the concerts had been thoroughly audited.

Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019, in a major blow to Mr Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century.

Mr Erdogan's party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.

The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won.

The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which the CHP made significant gains against Mr Erdogan's governing party.

A court formally arrested the mayor of Istanbul and key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan early on Sunday and ordered him to be jailed pending the outcome of a trial on corruption charges. Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was detained following a raid on his residence earlier this week, sparking the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade..

Officials said on Monday that Turkish police have detained several journalists and more than 1,100 citizens who protested against the arrest of Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, President Erdogan's main political rival. The arrest has drawn international condemnation and protests have spread to more than 55 of Turkey's 81 provinces. Police have detained more than 1,100 people, officials said Monday – including journalists – since the arrest of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main rival triggered s

US negotiators worked to hammer out details of a proposed partial ceasefire in Ukraine on Monday, meeting with representatives from Russia a day after holding separate talks with the Ukrainian team.

Each side has accused the other of undermining efforts to reach a pause in the three-year-old war.

Kyiv and Moscow agreed in principle on Wednesday to a limited ceasefire after US President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders, but the parties have offered different views of what targets would be off-limits to attack.

While the White House said “energy and infrastructure” would be covered, the Kremlin declared that the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure”.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he would also like to see railways and ports protected.

Talks on Monday are expected to address some of those differences, as well as a potential pause in attacks in the Black Sea to ensure the safety of commercial shipping.

US and Russian representatives began meeting in the morning in the Saudi capital, Russia's state Tass and Ria-Novosti news agencies reported.

The US and Ukrainian teams met on Sunday in Riyadh, and more contacts were expected, though it was not clear when.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday the Russian military is fulfilling President Vladimir Putin's order to halt attacks on energy facilities for 30 days.

Mr Peskov accused Ukraine of derailing the partial ceasefire with an attack on a gas metering station in Sudzha in Russia's Kursk region.

Ukraine's military general staff rejected Moscow's accusations and blamed the Russian military for shelling the station, a claim Mr Peskov called “absurd”.

Meanwhile, Russian troops launched a new barrage of drones, including decoys, into Ukraine overnight into Monday, according to Ukraine's air force, causing some damage and injuries.

Before the latest attack, Mr Zelensky said in a televised statement Sunday evening that “since March 11, a proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table, and these attacks could have already stopped. But it is Russia that continues all this”.

He added that Ukraine's partners — “the US, Europe, and others around the world” — should step up pressure on Russia “to stop this terror”.

Mr Zelensky has emphasized that Ukraine is open to a full, 30-day ceasefire that Mr Trump has proposed.

But Mr Putin has made a complete ceasefire conditional on a halt of arms supplies to Kyiv and a suspension of Ukraine's military mobilisation — demands rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies.

Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Mr Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said he expected “some real progress” at the talks in Saudi Arabia, and that a pause in hostilities between both countries in the Black Sea would “naturally gravitate into a full-on shooting ceasefire”.

Serhii Leshchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidency, said the delegation remained in Riyadh on Monday and expected to meet again with the Americans.

– China rules out supplying peacekeeping forces

Asked about reports speculating that China might send peacekeepers to Ukraine to enforce any future peace deal, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun responded on Monday with an unequivocal no.

“Let me stress that the report is completely false. China's position on the Ukraine crisis is clear and consistent,” Mr Guo said at a daily briefing.

China has provided Russia with trade earnings from oil and other natural resources, along with diplomatic backing, but has not given any weapons or sent any personnel.

China is, however, on close terms with North Korea, which has sent troops to fight alongside the Russian army.

– Ukrainian railways hit by cyberattack

A “massive targeted cyberattack” hit Ukrainian state railway operator Ukrzaliznytsia on Sunday, the company wrote on Telegram, adding that the restoration of its systems was ongoing as of Monday morning.

The company said the attack did not affect train movements or schedules, but that the online booking system was currently unavailable.

“The railway continues to operate despite physical attacks on the infrastructure, and even the most vile cyberattacks cannot stop it,” the company wrote.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's Special Operations Forces claimed to have destroyed four military helicopters in Russia's Belgorod region with the use of American-supplied Himars rocket systems.

The special forces published drone footage of what they said was the attack on their Telegram page on Monday.

The group wrote that the strikes had occurred at a concealed “jumping-off point” for Russian aircraft used in surprise attacks on Ukrainian forces.

Russian troops, meanwhile, fired 99 attack and decoy drones into Ukraine overnight Sunday, according to Ukraine's air force, of which 57 were shot down and 36 were lost from radar.

In the Kyiv region, one man suffered injuries overnight as a Russian drone struck a residential area.

“The man has superficial shrapnel wounds to his abdomen, chest, thighs, and head”, the acting head of the Kyiv region, Mykola Kalashnyk, wrote on Telegram on Monday.

In the Kharkiv region, a Russian drone struck a residential building in the village of Velyka Babka, injuring a 25-year-old man and a pregnant woman.

Both were admitted to hospital, regional head Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram on Monday morning.

Washington, D.C.'s iconic cherry blossoms are getting closer to the 2025 peak bloom. Thousands of trees with white and pink flowers circle the Tidal Basin and parks near some of the capital's famous monuments and memorials.

Here's what to know about when and where to see the cherry trees in bloom.

Peak bloom occurs when 70% of the blossoms of the Yoshino cherry trees, the most common type along the Tidal Basin, are open. The National Park Service, which tracks the blooming of the trees each year, predicts peak bloom will be between March 28 and 31 this year.

Based on over 100 years of data, the average peak bloom date is April 3, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The timing of peak bloom varies each year, largely due to temperatures, with warmer temperatures leading to earlier peak blooms. 

Since 1921, when the National Park Service began recording the dates, peak blooms have shifted earlier by about eight days, the EPA says.

As of March 23, 70% of the Yoshino cherry trees around the Tidal Basin reached the fifth stage in their blooming, which is puffy blossoms, according to the National Park Service. The next stage is peak bloom.

A live camera provided by the Trust for the National Mall offers viewers a chance to check the status of some of the blossoms.

The most famous place to see the cherry blossoms in the nation's capital is around the Tidal Basin in West Potomac Park. Many cherry trees are also along a section of the Potomac River and Washington Channel in East Potomac Park.

This year, construction that began in August 2024 to replace seawalls along the Potomac River and part of the Tidal Basin could affect the viewing of some of the cherry trees. The work is expected to last through 2026.

However, there are many other cherry trees throughout Washington, D.C. Casey Trees, a nonprofit that plants and cares for trees in the city, provides a map of where to see the blossoms across Washington. The map does not include trees on private property, the organization said.

The Yoshino cherry trees usually bloom for several days, the National Park Service said, but weather conditions will affect the length of time. 

""Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms,"" the agency said on its website. ""A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all.""

Japan gifted more than 3,000 cherry trees to the United States in 1912 as a symbol of friendship.

That year, first lady Helen Herron Taft and the wife of the Japanese ambassador, Viscountess Chinda Iwa, planted two of the Yoshino cherry trees along the Tidal Basin, the National Park Service notes in a history of the trees. In the next few years, the trees continued to be planted around the basin and other areas.

But the idea to plant Japanese cherry trees in the U.S. capital was raised as early as 1885 by a woman named Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, a writer and diplomat, according to the National Park Service. 

Despite her first request to the U.S. Army Superintendent of the Office of Public Buildings and Grounds not going anywhere, she continued to ask and eventually wrote to Herron Taft, who helped bring the idea to life, the agency says.

          / CBS New York
        

Sunday was opening night on Broadway for two of Hollywood's biggest stars.

Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal are taking on the new production of Shakespeare's ""Othello.""

The red carpet was full of VIPs, including Jennifer Lopez, Samuel L. Jackson, Anna Wintour, Colman Domingo and many more. And entertainers weren't the only ones in attendance. Former President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, were also seen entering the Barrymore Theatre.

Washington plays the conflicted and murderous title character. His jealousy and violence is carefully orchestrated by his backstabbing confidante Iago, played by Gyllenhaal.

Prior to the show, members of the cast explained how horrors and thrills created by Shakespeare now land with a freshness in a modern setting.

""They've treated this like a new play,"" said Andrew Burnap, who plays ""Cassio.""

""I'm excited to share,"" said Kimber Elayne Sprawl, who portrays ""Emilia.""

""Even if you know it, seeing it happen right in front of you, the conflict that happens in the play, it's just so human that it will always need to tell the story,"" said Molly Osborne, who plays ""Desdemona.""

Othello's director is Tony Award winner Kenny Leon.

""Denzel is an emperor. He's an emperor of the American stage, of the world stage. He has met this role head on and Jake has met Denzel head on,"" Leon said.

In February, while Othello was in rehearsals, CBS News New York sat down with Washington and Gyllenhaal. Both described their roles as exciting, and for each star a dream come true.

""We are given the freedom to break the rules,"" Washington said.

""I spent the past eight months really digging in because I've never done Shakespeare,"" Gyllenhaal added.

Producer Brian Moreland said a sizzling Shakespeare is what they were after and he credits the unbeatable cast and creators.

""It's that good and they're that good. Night after night they build that same journey, so that you get to the point that we all know is going to happen, it's all inevitable, but yet you're there with them on every single word they have to say,"" Moreland said.

To call Othello, which runs through June 8, a financial hit is an understatement as it is expected to earn the title of highest grossing Broadway play ever.

Oops, something went wrong

Tesla stock (TSLA) led gains among the ""Magnificent Seven"" on Monday, surging as much as 10% amid investor optimism that President Donald Trump's tariff plans may not be as wide-reaching as previously anticipated.

Read more about Tesla's stock moves and today's market action.

Reports that Trump will hold off on bringing in levies on the auto sector on April 2 eased worries that Tesla's bottom line would be impacted.

Shares of the EV maker had already been on a downward trend amid concerns of a drop in sales and a backlash against the brand over CEO Elon Musk's involvement in politics.

The stock began digging out of its most recent dip last week when Tesla revealed plans to launch its robotaxi service in 2025.

On Monday, the electric car maker responded to complaints about a pause in its Full Self-Driving trial in China, saying it will release the features once regulatory approval is secured.

Last Thursday, CEO Elon Musk held an impromptu company all-hands, giving an update on the progress of a number of products while also attempting to assuage fears that he wasn't ignoring his post.

The electric vehicle manufacturer's sales have slipped recently in key regions like Europe, China, and even the US.

As Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian recently reported, not only has the changeover to the new Model Y SUV been seen as a drag on sales, but Musk's closeness to President Trump and embrace of right-wing politics may be also impacting the brand.

Struggling chip giant Intel (INTC) could have a shot at future glory days.

But it's not guaranteed, and it won't be for a while, one analyst said.

""I think Intel has a much better shot of remaining viable in this industry [under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan],"" Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen below). ""It's not going to be easy — competition is not sitting still. Their competition, remember, is Nvidia. It's AMD. It's Arm Holdings. It's a Taiwan Semiconductor. It is Broadcom. It's Marvell.""

Intel announced Tan as its next CEO on March 12. He officially began last week.

Tan was the CEO of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) from 2009 to 2021. After serving on Intel's board for two years, he left in August 2024 following clashes with now-ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger on how to position the business, a source told me.

The source said Tan was interviewed for the CEO role of Intel at the same time as Gelsinger. Gelsinger ultimately got the gig in 2021 but had to play nice by agreeing to put Tan on the board. Tan frequently pushed for a better artificial intelligence strategy to take on Nvidia (NVDA) and faster decision making at the notoriously bureaucratic Intel.

Listen: What Bill Gates thinks about Intel

The tech industry veteran has numerous challenges on his hands at the iconic American tech player.

Gelsinger led aggressive efforts to turn around the troubled US chipmaker for more than three years. He slashed thousands of jobs, improved costs, secured CHIPS Act funding, built chip foundries, and promised fast AI chips that could compete with Nvidia and AMD (AMD).

He was fired in early December amid missed targets and a cash drain on the foundry business.

Intel's fourth quarter sales fell 7% year over year to $14.3 billion, and net earnings plunged 76%. The company forecasts it will only break even on the profit line this year.

Tan must stabilize the business, likely through more cost cuts and new leadership, and regain trust with Wall Street.

 

Arya thinks Tan could look for partners to fund the expensive production of chips, a potential cash-saving strategy some on the Street have pushed Intel to consider. He upgraded his rating on Intel's stock to Neutral following Tan's appointment.

The stock is too cheap based on Intel's intellectual property, Arya added.

""So all we are saying is that the only value on Intel [right now] is just right the bricks and mortar of its fabs, right? Which is obviously not the case,"" Arya explained. ""Now, should it really be valued as one of these growth companies? Obviously not. So I think what we were trying to say is that under his leadership, Intel has a better chance of adding [value] ... and getting recognized for its IP value because [Tan] comes from that background.""

Oops, something went wrong

Tech stocks were leading the US stock market rally on Monday, with headlines on more targeted tariff plans from President Trump and a new AI breakthrough from Jack Ma's Ant Group helping boost the sector to start the week.

Shares of Meta (META) and AMD (AMD) were each up better than 3% in early trade while Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 2.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up 1.5% shortly after the market open.

Monday's broad market rally followed reports late Sunday that Trump would narrow the number of US trading partners subject to reciprocal tariffs on April 2. The administration is also reportedly set to limit some industry-specific tariffs that were set to take effect, including those on cars and chips.

In the tech world, news early Monday out of China that Ant Group, the Jack Ma-backed tech conglomerate, has trained cheaper AI models using Chinese-made chips and those from AMD was the latest sign the AI race continues to push new boundaries.

Speaking last week at its GTC Conference, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the introduction of lower-cost models — like those most notably put forth by China's DeepSeek — shows the computing needs for AI are actually higher than previously thought. Nvidia's chips are also subject to an export ban from the US in China.

Read more about Nvidia's stock moves and today's market action.

Earlier this year, Nvidia stock fell over 16% in a single day after DeepSeek's R1 model matched the performance of higher-cost AI models like those from OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) at a fraction of the cost.

In the weeks since these developments, the industry has seen similar breakthroughs in the same vein as that vocalized by Huang. These reflect the larger-than-imagined potential of even deeper AI investments rather than exposing the limits of current plans. (See also: Jevons Paradox.)

Also in tech news, a South Korean AI chip startup FuriosaAI reportedly rejected an $800 million offer from Meta. This takes a potential headache away from Meta shareholders, who might have to price in regulatory overhangs and integration costs, and shows AI startups have plenty of confidence to explore the market independently.

Tech-specific developments, though a boost for the AI trade on the margins, still take a back seat to trade news. And though AI may not be the clearest fundamental winner or loser due to Trump's tariffs, tech's central role in the stock market rally since late 2022 has seen these stocks retain their leadership position on the way up and the way down.

As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer noted over the weekend, last week's reaction to the Federal Reserve's latest announcement made clear tariffs are — and will be — the key catalyst for markets in the coming weeks.

Fears about the health of the US economy, the outlook for corporate profits, and the direction of Fed policy have all taken a turn leading the daily market discussion during the S&P 500's swift 10% pullback from its Feb. 19 record close.

But tariffs have become the clear catalyst in shaping investor sentiment and the market's daily direction.

First, in their absence. And on Monday, as a positive presence.

""We are watching headline to headline,"" Jay Woods, chief market strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, told Yahoo Finance last week. ""And when didn't we have headlines? We didn't get any headlines out of Washington last Friday [March 14]. We didn't get any headlines out of Washington last Monday [March 17]. Guess what we did? We rallied.""

Nvidia (NVDA) is regarded as one of the fundamentally strongest semiconductor names in the game today.

But the action in the stock this year continues to defy that widely held Wall Street view on the chip giant. Nvidia stock is down 12% year to date, a far cry from the 171% advance posted in 2024.

""In the last few years, there was a lot of money chasing some of these large-cap stocks, including Nvidia, both institutional and retail, whereas a lot of money was taken out of international markets,"" Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen below). ""So I think some of that positioning sentiment is getting derisked at the start of the year.""

Arya — who has been covering Nvidia for more than a decade — says investors have rotated out ""Magnificent Seven"" momentum names and into international markets for better-perceived values.

""I think the fluff has been taken out [of Nvidia],"" Arya added. ""Because of the policy changes here [in the United States], that really impacts this global sector. So I think as the policy starts to stabilize, I think the positioning will start to come back in these [semiconductor] names. But the profitability and the fundamentals are exceptionally strong.""

Arya has a Buy rating on Nvidia with a $200 price target, which assumes about 68% upside from current levels. The average sell-side analyst price target on Nvidia is $171, according to Yahoo Finance data.

Nvidia has done its part to put the fluff back into its stock, pulling off another impressive annual GTC event last week from a product perspective.

Watch: What Bill Gates thinks about Jensen Huang

There were lots of details on powerful new AI chips, such as Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin, which could power the inference models that unleash AI into a new stratosphere.

Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang dropped a host of big numbers around artificial intelligence's potential. None were bigger than his prediction that Nvidia's data center infrastructure revenue will hit $1 trillion by 2028.

The company even took some wraps off a future AI chip called Feynman, set to drop in 2028.

By the end of the presentation, Huang had displayed Nvidia's full product roadmap through 2028 — an impressive feat given how much innovation the company has done on AI chips in the past two years alone.

The stock generally responded with a yawn after the event known as the ""Woodstock of AI.""

""I think it's probably still the use of more applications, which won't come from Nvidia — it'll come from their partners and their customers' customers,"" EMJ Capital founder and Nvidia bull Eric Jackson told me on Opening Bid about the potential next Nvidia stock catalyst.

 

Jackson pointed to recent AI application advances from Palantir (PLTR) and Klarna as good examples of what is likely coming in real-world AI usage. These tech plays are showing the Street how Nvidia stands at the center of AI use cases, given its leadership position for chips, he said.

""So I think it's got to be another story like those coming from some company using AI that is seeing just tremendous cost savings and so forth,"" Jackson added. ""I think it's got to come [from] that excitement and then the fact that other people are feeling the need to play catch-up to those examples. And then, obviously, they're going to have to buy more.""

A rally in US stocks Monday morning amid reports that President Trump's tariffs will be less widespread than feared underscored how more clarity on the administration's new policies remains the key to a market bounce-back.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added about 0.8% or more than 300 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, rising about 1.5%. The rally came after both Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported Trump's ""Liberation Day"" reciprocal tariffs will be more measured than initially thought.

Tariff uncertainty was a key catalyst for the stock market sell-off over the past month. Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz told Yahoo Finance that he'd be watching for any clarity on those policies as the key turning point for the stock market's drawdown to potentially bottom.

""Usually, [when] the primary catalyst that stops becoming a problem, essentially, that allows the market to find its footing,"" Kantrowitz said.

Initially, investors had been waiting for April 2, the day Trump dubbed ""Liberation Day,"" for more information on tariffs. But weekend reports indicated that the Trump administration has narrowed its focus on the tit-for-tat duties to what it has called the ""dirty 15"" countries — which have an unfavorable trade balance with the US.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business last week, ""It's 15% of the countries, but it's a huge amount of our trading volume.""

Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee wrote in a note to clients on Sunday night that markets appeared to be ""setting up for a potential face-ripper rally this week as recent developments have eased several of the major fears that have weighed on equities since December.""

""Trade war concerns are easing, brightening market sentiment,"" Lee wrote.

While Monday's market action shows markets have been hoping Trump's tariffs won't be as widespread as once thought, some equity strategists believe investors likely need official announcements from the administration before the tariff uncertainty overhang on stocks is fully removed.

""This relief that we're seeing is more a result of the fact that there was no sort of whiplash from the White House last week, and it seems like we've had more marginally positive news with respect to what tariffs might potentially look like on April 2nd,"" Raymond James chief market strategist Matt Orton told Yahoo Finance Monday morning. ""But I don't know if there's too much that we can put into that until we actually have certainty, until we're actually past April 2nd.""

Oops, something went wrong

The Federal Reserve continued to signal it will cut interest rates two more times this year, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell adopting a perceived dovish stance, a pleasant surprise for investors who came into Wednesday's policy decision with heightened fears over ""stagflation"" and the possibility of a US recession.

""It's a clearing event,"" Dennis DeBusschere, president of 22V Research, told Yahoo Finance following the decision. ""You didn't get a Fed that was going to accelerate the downside in markets.""

One big reason stemmed from the Fed's ""base case"" that tariff-induced inflation will be ""transitory"" and have a short-term ""one-off"" effect on price growth. This was reflected in the central bank's projections, which forecast year-end PCE inflation rising to 2.7% before reaching its 2% target by 2027 — ""a relief to investors"" who had been bracing for stickier prices, according to DeBusschere.

But some experts warn that ""transitory"" inflation remains an unrealistic expectation — and that the projections for two rate cuts this year could unravel as the Trump administration continues to flip-flop on trade policy. Powell himself said that ""there is a level of inertia"" to stay consistent with prior forecasts until greater clarity emerges.

""Uncertainty was a highlight of the statement,"" Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, wrote in response to Wednesday's decision. ""Like market participants, the Fed is at a highly uncertain point, and it is in need of time and data to determine the next course of action.""

Both consumer and producer inflation showed a deceleration in price growth over the month of February. But details under the surface pointed to a potential stalling out in reaching the Fed's 2% target, with tariffs serving as the greatest threat to Powell's ""transitionary"" base case.

There are also concerns the Fed may cut rates because of a weakening labor market and slowing economic growth — a move that wouldn't be cheered by investors.

""Everybody wants two cuts, three cuts, four cuts. You don't want any cuts. You want earnings growth. You want a strong economy,"" Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday. ""Be careful what you wish for.""

Despite a slightly more hawkish tilt from the central bank, with more FOMC members forecasting interest rates to either hold steady or come down by just 0.25% instead of the consensus 0.50%, traders still boosted their own expectations of where interest rates could end the year.

According to the latest data from Bloomberg, markets are now pricing in three cuts instead of two. But Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird, pushed back on reading too far into the projections.

""The 'dot plot' and [the Fed's] projections have not been super reliable over the last five years,"" Mayfield said, stressing that the uncertainties within the current economic and political environment add another layer of confusion when it comes to future policy.

""When the path forward is so unclear, you just take it with a grain of salt, go back to basics, and focus on the drivers of either the individual equities or the sectors in the market that you own,"" he said. ""In this case, thinking about things like earnings and long rates, rather than what the Fed is doing at the short end of the curve.""

Following the Fed's decision on Wednesday, markets experienced what Mayfield described as a ""relief rally,"" citing the lack of downside surprises in the forecasts. But the move higher was short-lived, with all three major indexes slipping into the red the following trading session.

Still, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow (^DJI) were able to eke out gains over the five-day period, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which has struggled as its ""Magnificent Seven"" leaders fail to deliver outsized returns, ultimately fell short.

""If you're going to really climb your way out of this hole, you need either clarity on the tariffs, which, who knows? Or you need some other sort of nice catalyst,"" Mayfield said. ""That could come in the form of next earnings season, or maybe it's a really strong jobs report that comes out of nowhere.""

""For now, we're kind of bouncing around and Powell's presser just wasn't enough to give the market the juice it needed to really get over the hump.""

	Compared with European Union countries and others, the United States is an outlier

While avoidable deaths in the United States rose, on average, from 2009 to 2019, they trended down for European Union countries and others.

In the United States, the number of deaths that didn't have to happen has risen over time.

From 2009 to 2019, the average rate of avoidable deaths rose by 33 per 100,000 people across the country, researchers report March 24 in JAMA Internal Medicine. Meanwhile, other countries trended down: Members of the European Union experienced an average decrease of 24 per 100,000 over the same time period. And countries that are part of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development — which come from North America, South America, Europe and Asia — reported an average decrease of 19 per 100,000.

The rise in avoidable deaths in the United States has occurred despite the fact that the country spends more on health care than any other high-income nation, the researchers write.

Avoidable mortality is a metric for how well health systems are working. It adds up the annual number of deaths among those under 75 years old that, with timely health care, wouldn't have happened. The average number of avoidable deaths across all U.S. states in 2019 was roughly 280 per 100,000 people.

The umbrella of avoidable mortality includes both preventable and treatable deaths. Preventable deaths — such as those from vaccine-preventable diseases and traffic collisions — are those that may be avoidable through public health prevention measures. Treatable mortality refers to deaths from conditions such as sepsis or appendicitis that may be avoidable with appropriate medical care. Some deaths, including those from heart disease, cervical cancer and tuberculosis, fall into both categories, with a proportion attributed to each.

The research team also assessed the average rate of avoidable deaths for individual U.S. states, which spanned from an increase of 5 per 100,000 people in New York to a jump of 100 per 100,000 people in West Virginia. The study wasn't designed to account for the specific factors fueling the overall increase in the United States or the differences between states. But the researchers write that state-level public health policies — such as Medicaid expansion, abortion restrictions and gun control measures — have diverged over time.

Jon Nelson is living what he calls his “bonus life” after recovering from severe depression.

Aidan Kahn

By Laura Sanders

2 hours ago

In this bonus episode of The Deep End, listen to an interview with Jon Nelson. He'll share how he's doing these days, now that his depression is gone. You'll hear about the work still ahead of him, which may be lifelong. And you'll hear about his plans for the future. 

Laura Sanders: This podcast deals with mental illness, depression and suicide. Please listen with care.

Hi listeners, we're dropping into your feeds this week with a special bonus episode of The Deep End. Over the last six episodes, you've heard about some of the hardest parts of Jon Nelson's life. And some of the best parts too. He's struggled through severe depression. He volunteered for an experimental treatment that involved brain implants, and now he's relearning how to live. For this bonus episode, we're going to check in with Jon and see how he's doing these days. You'll hear more from him about what it was like to go through severe depression, and what it's like now that he's out from under it, now that he's living what he calls his bonus life. Welcome to The Deep End. I'm Laura Sanders.

I called Jon in December of 2024, over two years out from his surgery. Here are parts of our conversation, including the part where he tells me that he's become friends with another person you might remember from the podcast, Amanda, the artist in New York City who had DBS surgery, too. Take a listen.

Sanders: Hi, Jon.

Jon: How is life? How you doing?

Sanders: Good. I'm doing really well. How about you?

Jon: I am too. I, a lot of, lot of stuff going on. My one colleagues says, a lot of momentum. I'll take momentum. Momentum is a good term.

Sanders: Oh my, yes. Thank you for talking to me again. Are you tired of me yet?

Jon: No, man, I'm, I'm all in, all the time. Your family OK? You guys doing OK?

Sanders: Yeah, we're all good. We're in the Christmas, you know, mayhem crash landing into the new year. How about you?

Jon: It's like, I just like Thanksgiving so much more, so less pressure, you know what I mean? It's like, the planning for a month for five minutes of opening gifts to like the crash, you know. Holidays are hard. I'm one of those where they're hard for me, so it's, they're less hard than they used to be, but still not like my favorite time of year.

I've become super close friends with Amanda, who I saw for that video after mine, and I reached out to Figee, and was like, “Yo, I was like, send my information to her.” And dude, immediately, she reached out and we've become, we've come tight. I may have told you this, but I, she ended up sending me her artwork. I was like, “Dude, can I get some of your artwork?” And, she sent me the high-res PDFs so I have it in like all my kids' bedrooms. 

Sponsor Message

Sanders: That's awesome. Which ones do you have in there?

Jon: The subway one is like my favorite, so that's in my musicians, kids' room and one of them with the heart, it's Amanda with the heart, is in my other kid's room, and the third one is blanking me right now, but, dude, they're just beautiful, like every one I see, and then she did, did you know she did a DBS book? Like how incredible is that? Like, it's just so neat, you know, that just. I love creativity. I love people with passion and creativity, and you can't beat that with her.

Sanders: Yeah, yeah. I mean, she, she sent that book and we used a few of the drawings to illustrate the, the new, the online version of this story, and it just like got me. You know, you can describe it in words and you can even hear her talking about it, but then seeing the way she kind of puts these colors together and like, designs it all, it's gorgeous.

Jon: We do like a monthly support group I started three years ago and, you can just tell, I can tell with every person, like their posture, their skin complexion, their, how animated they are. I know exactly where they are.

Sanders: Yeah. Is it Zoom? You meet on Zoom?

Jon: Yep. It's actually, well, it's a Google Meet, but yeah, it's web conference and it started from my first article that I did about three years ago, actually three years ago now, it was December 2nd, 2021. That's weird. That was, yeah, three years ago. And that's, I just had so many people reach out to me that were similar situations, high functioning folks, suffering through hell. And so that was kind of the goal was, you know, kind of a high-functioning mental health support group of people, like-minded folks who are in theory, what people think is hiding it, where we are not hiding it, but we are struggling and it's been great. Just like sometimes two people join, sometimes 15 people join, you know, it's just each month is different and it's been really cool.

Sanders: What kind of things do you talk about?

Jon: So in that support group, it's check-ins. It's where, where are you at right now? What's, what's changed? What's, where's your mind? Situational stuff, you know. Guys, how would you move forward with this? Which, you know, relatability. It's just all peer-based support and with zero intent or goal other than to be around like-minded people and be able to get as, as, as healthy as we can.

And just, you know, when you're dealing with a condition like we deal with, you know, being able to be around people who understand the hell and who also understand the stupidity of society for stigmatizing us, it's a really wonderful thing to feel quote unquote normal for a half a second.

Sanders: Yeah, yeah, it makes a ton of sense. And now, if you don't mind, I'll shift into kind of the same question for you, you know, Where, where are you right now? How are you doing?

Jon: So right now, I am just over two years from my surgery date. So I've been in remission for two years of this maniacally horrific disease. That does not mean that it is simple. It is easy. It's the exact opposite of that. I still have to work on it daily. I still have to be, maintain my, you know, try to keep my mood as neutral as it possibly can be. And, you know, one of the main things that I would say is, you know, Dr. Mayberg telling me that I needed to rehab my brain, and I didn't understand what that meant. And, you know, learning how to deal with sadness and kind of, have that being part of my life is extremely triggering for me still to this day. And I, you know, I went into the surgery, you know, hoping I would die. And, you know, coming out of it not dead, and coming out of it in remission from this disease is like winning the lottery. It wasn't even something that I thought was plausible. And so to come out of it and be disease free, is, is still earth-shattering to me.

But then I never would have thought that you take it one step further. And I am dealing with trauma. You know, I'm dealing with trauma from living in hell for as long as I did. And being an empath, being a middle child, being an emotional person, which I know is shocking to say as a dude, but that's what I am. And so to have your emotions completely pulverized and twisted and tortured for a decade, you know, you truly focus in on, on all aspects. And so I have to learn how to live with something that is part of my life for the rest of my life, which is being sad. And so being sad is an absolute normal human emotion. And sadness, anger, happiness, like they all happen and they come into your body and they leave your body. And so, I know that it's going to leave, but guess what? My analogy would be, you know, an alcoholic who has to, every once in a while, take a very, very large sip of alcohol, of wine. It would be very challenging for them to deal with that. It's the exact same scenario that I have. I still have to feel sadness. And so it's actually been very helpful for me too, in trying to explain to people the hell of this disease is we all have to experience human emotions. It's the cycle of life. The disease of severe depression is, you take that, you take that emotion of general sadness, maybe it's at a three out of 10, 10 being death. And it's doubled, it's tripled, and it never leaves your body. So those bad moments that you have, imagine multiplying them by, you know, two, three, four, five, and it never leaves your body. And the only thing consistent that you have is every day it gets a little worse. That's what it's like to deal with severe depression in a treatment-resistant form. And so add that feeling and thought onto an additional flame of society being stupid and judging and blaming and ostracizing millions of people for having this condition that nobody has asked for just like every other disease. That's why everyone dies. That's why everybody suffers. And it's that simple. And so to think that I can go through this and prove to the world that this is a biological disease, I just have a circuit off of my brain. I have 23 million pulses going into my brain, every day. If I do not have that electricity, I go immediately back into this maniacally horrific disease.

And so the fact that society judges, labels, blames, ostracizes me and millions of other people for something that we did not ask for is the reason that healthcare costs for this disease and all the other comorbid conditions exist. It's because of the stupidity of society for blaming, labeling, judging, ostracizing for a disease that we didn't ask for. You look at cancer, there is communal love, support, a hug. And that's exactly how it should be. It's beautiful. Like, let's take care of you, your family. We feel sorry for you. The exact opposite is serious mental illness. That's the problem. That's why everybody suffers and dies.

Sanders: Yeah, I, I remember you telling me it's a non-casserole disease, and that really struck me.

Jon: It is a one hundred percent non-casserole disease. Everybody lines up, everybody, everybody goes over to the person's house who's suffering from cancer. Meals are coordinated every single day. People are driving folks down for therapy and treatment. It's beautiful. It's the best part of humanity, and you could not get a more further from reality situation than serious mental illness, and it's absolutely appalling to me. It's unjust and it's right in everybody's face on why everybody suffers and dies. And people just continue to do it. So that's my mission for the rest of my life is to poke society, to let them know that their behavior is absolutely directly responsible for suffering and death.

Sanders: You described your depression as feeling like a poison in your body. Do you feel that poison anymore?

Jon: So my depression, the feeling that I had is, my two biggest symptoms before going into surgery were a constant desire for death, euphoria to die. I wouldn't, I'd thought about suicidal ideation as much as I was breathing. I mean, it was that pervasive and consistent in my life. And so that's my mind portion of it. And then my second portion of it was exactly what you said, physically ravaged my body. And so to explain that to you, think about the feeling that you get, the full-body sensation feeling you get when you have a fever, right? You have the aches, you have the shakes, you have the, it's just pure discomfort, right? Like this is awful. So take that feeling, that same physical overwhelming feeling, and it's just death and dread, just circulating through my body. Like I could feel it in my fingertips. I could feel it everywhere. And so to wake up from the surgery, and they turn the device on, and both of those are gone, immediately, like gone. It's still surreal to this day. And so when I think about the before and afters, I, I, there was just so many. I mean, one of them that is just so vivid to me is I got this massive tattoo before my surgery on my left arm. I've never gotten a tattoo. I wanted to kind of, you know, do something to, I don't know if the right word is commemorate, memorialize. I don't even know what it is. I guess symbolically, you know, represent my fight through this hell. And so I just, a big nature scene on my left arm, and that's because being out in nature, specifically around trees, you know, reduces symptoms of depression. So I was like, all right, let's bring it here. I didn't feel it. You know, they put, they took four days to get this thing on. And I didn't feel it. It wasn't pleasant. It wasn't unpleasant. It was just there. And I had to go back and get it touched up after my surgery, and I had to have her stop multiple times, cause I could feel again in my body. I could actually feel something other than the hell of this horrific disease. And so that's an absolute perfect example.

Sanders: I wonder if there are any surprises that have come out of all of this. After going through the run-up to the surgery, the surgery itself, kind of this rehab portion. Were there any unexpected changes or anything that happened that surprised you?

Jon: For sure. I think that I very quickly learned that I'm living a bonus life. And it's a lot of fun living a bonus life, because things that you typically would say, wouldn't say or you would think, but I don't know if I should say this or do this, I fully embrace those moments, you know? I fully embrace them, and I say what most people wouldn't. And that's mostly positive. That's some negative, and I enjoy that with my advocacy because I like poking. I like poking because I want you to think differently. And I will tell you the most, like similar, some of these things are kind of taboo, right? Oh, don't talk about mental illness in the work setting and blah blah blah. I do the opposite. I go straight at it hard. The more, the more raw that I am, the more pokey that I am, the more successful that I have become with my advocacy and with momentum. And there's not been one thing that I have done in this outside world of being in remission of depression and talking about it and being very open about it and being very raw, being very real, that has been negative in the slightest bit. It's been nothing but positive.

Sanders: A bonus life. I love that phrase and that thought. Does it show up with your family? Do you feel like you're living a bonus life with your kids and your wife?

Jon: A hundred percent. I owe everything to them. I owe everything to my wife, you know, she's just a rock, the most amazing person, you know, the only person that these horrific maniacal diseases are, are, are worse for than the person suffering is the caretaker, caregiver, and that was my wife. And so to be able to see the hell that she went through while watching the person that she loves, who I know I'm a good father, a good provider, a good husband, just deteriorate. And all those things are on her now. And she's her, her, her bandwidth is zero, and, you know, society is not helping her. Society is judging her too. And it's horrific. And so to be able to, to be able to see, you know, her in the scenario that we're in now, which is, we're out of it, you know, we're out of it. She's still cautious. It's been two years. She's still cautious. I'm still cautious. I'm always afraid, you know? Use your cancer remission. You know, I'm in remission, but I still gotta get checked and make sure it doesn't come back, you know? So we always will live with that fear, but yeah, I mean, just, just the the, the standard, the typical embrace. The hugs are different. The watching a show together is different. The being around the kids is different.

You know, my kids, it's all they knew, right? They knew I'm a good dad. They knew they got to see me healthy dad prior, and they also had to see sick dad, and they knew that it wasn't me, they knew it was the disease, they truly did, you know, and and I talked to him about it all the time of, “Guys, how did this impact you?” And they're like, “It's all we knew. It was our life and it's great to have you back.”

And so to come out of this on the other side and be able to have just genuinely enjoy your time together and have conversations and be able to throw a football with them again, you know, be able to take my daughter, she's turning 16, we're going over Christmas. I'm taking her on a dad-daughter trip to San Francisco and we're gonna drive down the coast to L.A. Like, do you know how beautiful that is? I mean, I, it's just stunning that I can do that now and enjoy every single moment, you know? Including the, every single minute in that car ride down and the laughter and the music. I couldn't do that before. Now I, I can experience joy in a healthy way and enjoy it tremendously, and grow very important relationships in my life.

Sanders: Yeah, yeah, it does seem like just a qualitatively different thing to feel that way versus the absence of something awful. Yeah, yeah. Are you taking your daughter to where you used to live?

Jon: When the kids turned five years old, and my wife and I were like, let's take them on a trip, like each individually, like mom, dad, kid trip. It's just a fun age, you know, he turned five and my my middle guy, I'll give an example, is like, I wanna go to New York City, and so we went to New York City and he's five years old out on, I still remember Park Avenue and 37th Street, holding his hand up, hailing a cab. You know, we're doing all the, you know, it's just was fun, right? It's like one of those moments where like they really can experience life and understand it and do some cool stuff. And so we just came up with this. My daughter's turning 16, and so my wife and I are like, let's do something like that. Like, let's give them another opportunity. And I happen to be extremely lucky, cause it works out perfectly for me to be able to take her. So we're just doing a solo trip. And so she could pick anywhere in the world, literally, we're like, where do you wanna go? What do you wanna do?

And it really makes you realize how nostalgic people are for their origins, and she was born and raised out in San Francisco. She left when she was four, but it's still part of her identity. And so the fact that she picked going to San Francisco and driving down the coast and stopping at Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay and Carmel and, you know, hitting, hitting L.A. It's pretty cool, you know? And so that's, that's, that's really what drove it is, you know, I think let's get back to my, my hometown and let's smile and see some beauty and make some great memories.

And so, you know, my big thing with my kids is I always try to go to a high level in regards to what am I trying to achieve. And, you know, parenting is, is not easy. It's, it's, I always say you want to hug them 10 times a day and punch them 10 times a day, right? There's, there's ups and downs and it's, it's overall amazing. But, you know, being able to get your kids out of the house, like my focus is always on, you know, if you can have, you know, if you can be a good, independent person and you can be confident, I did my part and, you know, I'm very, very fortunate that, you know, my daughter is right there. And, you know, being able to help guide that and being able to play a part in making that happen is, is really, really fun for me. And that's what motivates me as a parent.

Sanders: Yeah, that makes perfect sense, seeing them kind of launch in their own lives and, and knowing you did what you needed to do, and now they're going to go off on their own adventures.

Jon: If you hit those two qualities, all the other ones come. That's why you gotta start high. Everything else will happen.

Sanders: Shifting a little bit to the research, I wonder if you're still involved in the research project at all, and if so, what that looks like.

Jon: So here's a human behavior thing that I find fascinating is we had to do two times a day, we had to commit to a journal, a video journal. We had to do eight minutes of brain scans. Essentially they would analyze my brain waves. We had to do multiple, multiple choice questions on our, on our feelings. We had to do that twice a day, so it was a commitment and, and that was something that was not a problem. Let's go. Like, this is what I gotta do for this, there's a lot of, a lot of to do's. We had to do our part. And at about six months, that turned into once a day. And then a couple of months later, it was once a week. And so I'm at that phase now where it's, it's once a week. But, but here's the challenge. The challenge is, it's harder to do once per week than it is to do twice a day every day. How wild is that, right? And so that's my challenge is like, I screw up and don't make my deadlines a lot. And so it's, you know, it's something that's always in the back of my head. And so the short answer is, is, yeah, I'll be connected to these guys for an extremely long time, and it's amazing. At some point I'll be stopping the kind of video journal and the brain activity, but I still meet with the psychiatrists on a quarterly basis, and it's more of a check-in. They're still fully available to me when I email. The humanity that this group has provided me is, is exceptional. And they're in my corner. You know, at some point I'm gonna need to change. I have the R plus S Medtronic investigational device in my chest. That's the pacemaker, and they have a new commercial grade of available device that I will have to get into my chest. So they'll basically cut me open and swap that out. It's a battery. They say pacemaker, but it's a battery. That's how I look at it. So I'll get the newest and greatest battery in there, and that's also something that will be included as part of the trial. I know Medtronic has provided those to them as part of this clinical trial.

When you go through severe depression, serious mental illness in this country which is apparently the best country on the planet which I highly, highly, highly contest based off of going through this journey, and then you walk into a clinical trial environment like I did, I can't begin to tell you the difference, like how absolutely different they are, and how broken our mental health system is in this country. I had physicians looking at me in the eye. I had them telling me that they want to help me, that they know something's wrong with me, that they believe me, that they can fix me. I'm saved for sure by this medical technology in my brain, a hundred percent. But it's not just that. It's definitely that, but it's also their humanity. It's their empathy. It's how they talk to me. It's how they believe me. That is absolutely part of this, and that's where it needs to be all the time, especially with a disease, like with the, the diseases within serious mental illness. That's all we're dealing with is broken minds. So to be able to help, help a broken mind by being kind, costs no money. Looking at somebody in the eye costs zero money, nothing. You don't need millions of dollars of consultants to fix this problem. You need to create an environment that can get people into the healthcare system sooner. And you need to get the people who are in there. Guess what? When you're getting somebody a year into living through hell versus 10 years, again, I have no validation for this, but it's a pretty logical assumption to think, it'd be a hell of a lot easier to fix that after a year rather than 10 years.

Sanders: Yeah, and it hits home when you talk about kind of the rehab portion of your brain, too. Like if you're trying to change after a decade of these patterns that you've adapted to and learned to live with versus a year of that, that rehab portion's gonna be a lot easier too.

Jon: Absolutely, one hundred percent. And I, I didn't understand the significance of the rehab portion, and that's something for sure that I've taken out of this. And my initial thought was, dude, I'm good. I don't feel this disease all over my body and my mind isn't warped with constant suicidal ideation. That was naive of me, because I got to understand that it is an absolute journey. I need to continue to put the work in. I need to continue to not get super angry with certain situations before that would make me angry, that would put me right into a recurrence. And so I need to sit back and you know, not let certain situations bug me like they would as much as they typically do, right? I need to be very cognizant of my mood to keep it as neutral as possible to avoid any major ups or major downs.

Sanders: You told me a while back you're still crabby. You were crabby, you're still crabby. Do you still feel crabby now?

Jon: You know, irritability was probably the one characteristic that stayed similar. And so my, my joke about it, but it's probably true, is, you know, I'm just like I guess certain aspects of my life, I'm the cranky old dude, right? Like it just happens throughout life. You're tired, you're exhausted, you're going, being pulled in a million directions and you're parenting and then things don't stop. So yes, I do get irritable still, but you know, that's called being a human being. I'm not anywhere near perfect, but in general, my smiles are back more and I feel, I feel really good. Am I perfect? Nope. This, this, this, this surgery does not, does not cure life problems, but it sure, it sure eliminates and destroys a horrific disease that's in your body.

Sanders: So when I visited your house, there were some jokes about hiding your charger and changing your settings, and I wonder if you all still joke about things that that are kind of in this realm.

Jon: Yeah, you have to add humility and humor and laughter to all of this. And, you know, yes, a hundred percent. And, you know, a simple way to think of that, my, my wife saying after the first week of me being home, her line to the doctor was, “Is there any chance we can turn the volume down on this a little bit?” Because I'm back. I'm back with a force. And, you know, it's that, they say that with a big smile on their face. And you know, I, I, I joke around with my, you know, family, my daughter. I'm like, so what is it like when we weren't here this weekend, you know, myself and my boy, we were at like a hockey tournament, so it's like, “It's a lot quieter.” So like, that stuff's awesome, you know? Like, I mean, it's just, it's such a prime example of like what this disease does, this brain disease, that's what this is, you know. It just mutes you. It, it takes you away from everybody. It takes your core essence away. And so being able to have that back is great. And so my line to them all the time when they're busting my chops and, and, and having fun with this, which they should, is, you chose me. You chose me. It's not on me, dude. You picked me, guys. The kids didn't really. They're kind of forced in this scenario, but the wife did.

Sanders: She totally did. I love it. Very true. You've done so much evocative explaining of what this felt like and what this disease has done to you, how it's affected you, how it's affected your family. I wonder if there's a way to explain to someone who's not felt this firsthand and may not have a family member or a loved one who's felt this. What would you say to them, to kind of sum up what this disease is like?

Jon: To those folks who have no understanding of this, I will say a couple things. There's not many of you. You know, when I start talking about this publicly and speaking, there's always somebody. Either it's a friend or a family or them. There is a connection to somebody with lived experience, so they've gotten to see firsthand most of the time what this looks like. And for those who haven't, awesome. I'm so happy that you have not been exposed to it, and it's the most simplistic thing in the world. The symptoms of this disease, the brain disease of severe depression, the symptoms are a desire to die and a consumption of your body with hell. It's toxicity burning within your body. That's the symptom. The symptom of another neurological disease, Parkinson's, is shaking, right? It's tremors. You know, look at epilepsy. It's seizures, right? The symptoms are different, based off of every disease. The fact that society doesn't understand and questions and judges folks with severe depression is what makes them die, and the unfortunate portion of this is the major symptom of these are torture. And so that's what we have to understand, is that the people who have this horrific disease didn't ask for it, at all. And so being able to surround them with love and kindness like you do with every other disease, and let them know that you love them and you care for them, it's life-saving.

Sanders: If we could shift to kind of the future now, I, I wonder if there's something you picture for yourself, you know, in, in the next year, in 2035? Where do you want to be? In 2050, where do you want to be? What's, what's on your long-term horizon?

Jon: I've have a colleague of mine that has been, said something very cool to me that sums up where I am right now with my patient advocacy. I actually call it more activism, because I do wanna poke and I do want to make people feel uncomfortable, so that they can change their behavior, is you have a lot of momentum right now. And I like that I have a lot of momentum. I unfortunately, am not listening to Dr. Helen Mayberg, who after the trial said, “You need to take it easy. You need to not do too much.” Well, I'm not listening to her cause I'm doing a lot, and I'm, but here's the fun reason why, is, I am extremely motivated. I'm extremely passionate for this. There is a massive, massive, massive problem with a very simple solution, and I'm going to be in your face until the day that I die poking you and letting you know that you're absolutely wrong and that, you know, we have the most simplistic way that we can possibly fix this, the complete moronic world that we're in right now, which is simply by showing empathy and being kind to people with mental illness. Then we save, we save lives. We save suffering. Like, let's go. I'm all about it.

And so when I look at 10 years from now, you know, in the last year, I have been so fortunate to be in the world that I've been in. I mean, being a part of your Science News piece, I was able to speak in the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. I was able to participate in a congressional briefing for the neuroscience caucus in April. I've been able to, you know, lead multiple academics, physician conventions and sessions. I mean, every opportunity I get, I just smile, and I just say, “Let's go.” You know, phenomenal opportunity for more exposure, for more places to get the, the message out.

So my long, my aunt always says to make a long story endless, to make a long answer endless, I will, I want to poke and prod and be at the point where people are like, “This dude, this dude, this dude is all in, like, all in.” And so my Pulverize the Stigma initiative I have that I've created, this is just my personal brand. I got it tattooed on me, right? Like I am officially all in on this.

Sanders: Before we end, I wanna ask how Barbara is doing, how your kids are doing. What's the update with everybody?

Jon: Kids are cruising. We got 6th grade, 8th grade, 10th grade, all so different, all so fun to figure out what makes, makes each one of them tick and support those passions and create those, you know, good values that we're trying to do as a family. And you know, my wife is, she's just a rock. So my, my world is is hectic and crazy and it's kind of chess pieces putting around everywhere to make things work, and it's, and it's really going well. And so to still have her be this rock of the family, which she is. I mean, it's not fair, moms and, moms get a lot put on them, you know, for, for the houses and the families. It's just true. I mean, it's just the reality, and it's not right, and we're doing everything we can to, to, to pull our weight and make a, make a bigger impact on this family, but my God, she is just the strongest person I know. She puts everybody else before her and, you know she's thriving right now at work. She's about to start a new job, which is something extremely excited for, at a new great company, and it's fun to see her smile and laugh. And you know, she had a day home from work yesterday, an unplanned day home from work, and you know, to be able to see her sitting on the couch drinking coffee watching the Today Show, is, it's like, doesn't happen. And so to be able to see her kind of being able to relax for a hot second is amazing and I value those moments tremendously.

Sanders: This bonus life.

Jon: Exactly, yeah. And being able to be home, and so her new job actually provides her an extra day off a week, which is, if anybody deserves it, oh my, it's her. And I'm very excited that she'll be able to have some alone time in the house without being pulled in a billion different directions. And that to me is happiness.

Sanders: Is there anything else you'd like to add? Anything we haven't covered that you want to emphasize or highlight for people listening?

Jon: Show empathy and be kind and save lives. It's not difficult. We're not anywhere near where we need to be, but just focus on that. Show empathy, acknowledge when people tell you that they're suffering, that you are sorry. Treat it like any other condition. I'm extremely sorry you're going through this. You're loved. And you proactively be kind to them. You don't ask them what you need. You come home, like I did one day, and my lawn was mowed by my neighbor. I'll never forget it, ever. It took him 15 minutes to do this. I'll never forget it. You know, being able to feel loved when your entire mind is being warped and you're being judged by society. Being able to have people do kind things for you, you'll never forget. And so it's not hard.

Sanders: A beautiful sentiment to end on, just showing up for people we love.

Jon: Not hard. It's all we need to do. 

Sanders: Yeah. Jon: Surround me with those people and we will have a good, a good world and a good life, and that's what we're trying to do.

Sanders: Well, I want to thank you again for not just today, but the, the years now that you have spent with me patiently answering all my questions, indulging the stupid questions, explaining the things that I ask about over and over and over again. I've been so grateful for you and your whole family, and everyone who's who's kind of held my hand as we try to explore some of these ideas. So thank you very much.

Jon: Well, here's my thank you to you. Thank you for paying attention to this. Thank you for making it an amazing online series, video series, podcast series to get the, phenomenal platform to get this message out because everybody should be doing this, and the fact that you are is absolutely commendable, and I, I will be a part of this and whatever you need from me for the rest of my life. Call, text, I'm there.

Sanders: If you or someone you know is facing a suicidal crisis or emotional distress, call or text the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988.

NASA Astronauts Finally Return, Seals Hold Their Breath, and Penguin Poop Stresses Out Krill

In this week's news roundup, two NASA astronauts finally return to Earth after nine unexpected months in space, gray seals hold their breath for more than an hour, and penguin poop panics krill.

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Let's kick off the week by catching up on some science news you may have missed.

We'll start out with a space update that we've all been waiting about nine months for…

[CLIP: NASA's SpaceX Crew-9 Re-Entry and Splashdown: “And splashdown Crew-9 is back on earth [cheering]”]

Feltman: Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are finally back on Earth. The two NASA astronauts, who were meant to spend about a week on the International Space Station but have been there since June, splashed down in a SpaceX capsule last Tuesday evening. Welcome home, Butch and Suni!

If you're wondering why it took so long to bring them back after their arrival vehicle's initial technical difficulties, the answer isn't very exciting—it basically came down to scheduling issues. First, NASA had to bump two other astronauts off an upcoming mission so that their return vehicle would have room for Butch and Suni. Once that mission made it to the station, it had to stay put until the next mission came up to relieve the prior crew of their duties. Space is hard, as folks so often say, and multiple ISS missions are bound to mean multiple delays.

In other space news, last week scientists unveiled images of a planetary system 130 light-years away snapped by the James Webb Space Telescope. In an exciting first, the JWST was able to directly capture images of carbon dioxide gas on an exoplanet. That means JWST lives up to its promise of sussing out the chemistry of planetary atmospheres from a distance. These observations suggest that the four planets of the system, known as HR 8799, were likely formed through a process called core accretion. That process starts with the gradual formation of solid cores, which go on to attract gas from inside a protoplanetary disk. It's the same way Saturn and Jupiter formed. At 30 million years old or so, HR 8799 is a baby compared to our roughly 4.6-billion-year-old solar system, so studying these alien worlds could give us a glimpse into what our own gas giants looked like in their early days. And speaking of early days, when it comes to JWST the best is still yet to come. The space telescope was designed to last for at least five years, but the hope is that it can make it more than 20.

Now let's catch up with the Environmental Protection Agency. In last week's news roundup, I outlined EPA head Lee Zeldin's plans to undo heaps of environmental legislation. I also mentioned his purported plan to cut 65 percent of the agency's costs. Last week, thanks to documents reviewed by Democrats on the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, we got a clearer picture of those prospective cost-cutting measures.

The New York Times reported last Monday that the EPA's plan calls for firing up to 1,155 scientists, as well as getting rid of the Office of Research and Development. This is the EPA's main science arm, which conducts research on environmental issues such as pollutants and their effects on humans. Zeldin said in a Fox Business appearance on Tuesday that the EPA was still “working through” cost-cutting decisions. Also on Tuesday, Representatives Valerie Foushee, Deborah Ross and Zoe Lofgren, who are all members of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, put out a joint statement condemning the supposed plans. They argued that, considering the EPA's obligation to use the best-available science in making its decisions, eliminating its main science branch would be illegal. If you like having clean air and water, you might consider calling up your own congressional reps to ask them to take a stand too.

Meanwhile last week President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, a platform he owns, that he was authorizing his administration to “immediately begin producing energy with BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN COAL.”

“Clean coal” is a nebulous term referring to technologies that make coal less polluting than it would be without those technologies. But there's no way of handling coal that makes it a clean form of energy. There are a few facilities that now use carbon capture technology to mitigate coal's impact on the environment, but this technology is expensive and lemme be very clear about this it doesn't turn coal into a zero-carbon energy option. Coal is the most polluting source of energy. It releases heaps of carbon dioxide, contributes to environmental issues like acid rain and smog, and can cause lung disease.

On Truth Social, President Trump claimed that “Environmental Extremists” and “Thugs” had allowed other countries, particularly China, to gain economic advantages over the U.S. by opening new coal plants. While it's true that China has opened new coal plants in recent years, it's worth noting that the country's percentage of electricity generated from coal is actually on the decline.

It's also worth noting that last Wednesday the World Meteorological Organization reported that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are at an 800,000-year high. So yeah, consider calling your reps!

For no particular reason, I could use a little bit of a breather. Let's just talk about animals for the rest of the episode.

First, have you ever wondered how seals avoid drowning? You totally should wonder that cause gray seals, for instance, can hold their breath for more than an hour at a time. A study published last Thursday in Science could help explain how. It turns out that gray seals can seemingly sense how much oxygen is in their blood at any given moment.

Like most mammals, humans don't necessarily react to a lack of oxygen in the air. We're much more sensitive to an uptick in our carbon dioxide levels, which prompts us to breathe more. If a gray seal started to get that panicky air-hunger feeling as soon as the saturation of CO2 in their blood started going up while they were holding their breath, they'd never get anything done. But it seems they've got a trick for that: just cutting out the middleman and sensing oxygen directly.

Scientists tested this by giving seals air with different levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide before the animals went for their dives. The researchers found that seals would dive for longer after inhaling more oxygen-rich air and would cut their dives short after getting less oxygen. When the seals inhaled air with high levels of carbon dioxide, it didn't really change their dive length.

While this study looked at gray seals, they're not even the most accomplished divers in the seal world. The northern elephant seal can dive for up to two hours at a time. It's even possible that this oxygen-sensing trait came from a fairly distant ancestor that is applies to more than just mammals. After all, the emperor penguin can stay underwater for up to 27 minutes.

And speaking of penguins it turns out their poop causes a big ruckus among zooplankton world. In a study published last Thursday in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science, researchers zoomed in on the behavior of Antarctic krill. These tiny, shrimplike creatures are crucial members of the food chain, so they spend a lot of their time trying not to get eaten. Scientists already knew that krill used their sense of smell to react to things like food and pollution, so naturally they thought, “Why not try penguin poo?” Sure enough, when exposed to seawater containing guano in a tank, the little critters swam faster, pivoted direction more, and ate less algae. You might be asking yourself why scientists are interested in this crap. Like literally specifically this crap. But between krills' spot on the food chain and their ability to sequester carbon by eating algae, these little guys can have a big impact on the ocean. Krill are already changing their behaviors due to climate change, sea ice loss and ocean acidification by moving further south.

And if you need a pick-me-up this week, just take a moment to be grateful you aren't on penguin doody duty: researchers had to collect a couple ounces of the stuff for the study, and apparently it smells like rotten shellfish.

That's all for this week's news roundup. We'll be back on Wednesday to talk about the changing science of invasive plants. And stay tuned for a very special video episode on Friday. We're giving you a tour of the cutting-edge lab where MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] scientists study and fabricate stuff at the nanoscale.

Advances in materials and architecture could lead to silicon-free chip manufacturing thanks to a new type of transistor.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Researchers in China say they have created a new silicon-free transistor that could significantly boost performance while reducing energy consumption. The team says this development represents a new direction for transistor research.

The scientists said that the new transistor could be integrated into chips that could one day perform up to 40% faster than the best existing silicon processors made by U.S. companies like Intel. This is according to a report in the South China Morning Post (SCMP).

Despite that dramatic increase in power, the researchers claim that such chips would also draw 10% less power. The scientists outlined their findings in a new study published Feb. 13 in the journal Nature.

Lead author of the study Hailin Peng, professor of chemistry at Peking University (PKU) in China, told SCMP: ""If chip innovations based on existing materials are considered a 'short cut', then our development of 2D material-based transistors is akin to 'changing lanes'.""

The efficiency and performance gains are possible thanks to the chip's unique architecture, the scientists said in the paper, specifically the new two-dimensional silicon-free transistor they created. This transistor is a gate-all-around field-effect transistor (GAAFET). Unlike previous leading transistor designs like the fin field-effect transistor (FinFET), a GAAFET transistor wraps sources with a gate on all four sides, instead of just three.

At its most basic level, a transistor is a semiconductor device found in every computer chip. Each transistor has a source, a gate and a drain, which allow the transistor to function as a switch.

The gate is how a transistor controls the flow of current between the source and drain terminals and can act as both a switch and amplifier. Wrapping this gate around all sides of a source (or sources, as some transistors contain multiple) — instead of just three as in conventional transistors — leads to potential improvements in both performance and efficiency.

This is because a fully wrapped source provides better electrostatic control (as there is less energy loss to static electricity discharges) and the potential for higher drive currents and faster switching times.

While the GAAFET architecture isn't itself new, the PKU team's use of bismuth oxyselenide as the semiconductor was, as well as the fact they used it to create an ""atomically-thin"" two-dimensional transistor.

—Unique transistor 'could change the world of electronics' thanks to nanosecond-scale switching speeds and refusal to wear out

2D bismuth transistors are less brittle and more flexible than traditional silicon, the scientists added in the study. Bismuth provides better carrier mobility —the speed at which electrons can move through it when an electrical field is applied. It also has a high dielectric constant — a measure of a material's ability to store electrical energy — which contributes to the transistor's increased efficiency.

Should this transistor be fitted into a chip that does prove faster than US-made chips by Intel and other companies, it could also allow China to sidestep current restrictions on buying advanced chips and tap into US chip-making by shifting to a wholly different manufacturing process.

Fossil fuels powered the industrial revolution. Would aliens need a similar power source to jump-start a technical revolution?

The burning of fossil fuels — coal, oil and gas — propelled humanity into the industrial revolution, remaking civilization in its wake. Gasoline powers many of the cars we drive; coal and natural gas are central to global energy. But if aliens were building their own society, would they have to go down the same path as humanity, relying on fossil fuels to build their advanced civilization? Or could they find an alternative?

To build a modern civilization, aliens would likely need to use a source of energy that's just as abundant as fossil fuels, said Lewis Dartnell, an astrobiologist and author of ""The Knowledge: How to Rebuild Our World from Scratch"" (Penguin Press, 2014). It would be hard for them to simply bypass the production of fossil fuels, he noted.

Dartnell drew a parallel with humans: In the 18th century, the world entered the industrial revolution by tapping into what appeared to be a limitless source of energy. Coal burned longer and produced more power than wood and charcoal.

""Prior to that, energy was the fundamental limitation on how much you could do,"" he said. ""It would limit how much you could mine and move things around, what you could build, and what you could make.""

The question of whether humans could have bypassed fossil fuels to reach alternative energy sources is ""somewhat of a chicken-and-egg dilemma,"" Dartnell told Live Science. For instance, producing solar panels requires silicon, and extracting and refining this element demands a significant amount of energy.

The easiest way for intelligent aliens to create fuel would be to start by burning stuff, like humans did, until they can move to other sources of energy. They could perhaps harness the light of a star or of the kinetic energy of the wind. But wind energy on its own would not create the high temperatures needed for the smelting, forging and casting of metals, which would be needed for industrialization, Dartnell said.

Meanwhile, hydropower would only work if the planet had significant amounts of accessible liquid, which most planets we've found don't possess, added Seth Shostak, an astronomer and director of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute.

Scientists still haven't found a planet with abundant oxygen in its atmosphere, though trace amounts have been found on Mars, Venus and Jupiter's moon Europa. Oxygen is the key ingredient in burning fossil fuels because it enables combustion, which is what releases the energy stored in coal, oil and gas.

Fossil fuels are created from life — they're the transformed remains of plants and animals that lived hundreds of millions of years ago. Dartnell suggested that plate tectonics are a crucial part of the puzzle of how these life forms came to exist. ""There's good reason to suspect that in order to have intelligent life on an Earth-like planet, you need to have plate tectonics to regulate the climate for long periods of time,"" he said.

A 2022 study by researchers at the University of Sydney reported how Earth's tectonic plates move carbon between the deep Earth and the surface, forming what they call a ""carbon conveyor belt."" This process is key to maintaining Earth's ""Goldilocks"" climate, making the planet habitable, according to the study. What's more, plate tectonics also results in continental drift and the creation of conditions that produce large amounts of coal, a fossil fuel, he added.



Put another way, plate tectonics can help pave the way for life and create conditions to help it become fossil fuels; it can also create ideal conditions for life that may become intelligent enough to harness those fuels.

""In a sense, you get a two-for-one,"" Dartnell said. ""If you have a planet with active plate tectonics, that regulates the climate, which allows for the evolution of intelligent complex life.""

Scientists have yet to find another planet with active plate tectonics. Nor have they found fossil fuels in space. What they have discovered, however, is evidence of fossil fuels' chemical building blocks: hydrogen and carbon. Approximately 75% of the universe's mass is composed of hydrogen, said Shostak. Additionally, scientists have found a field of liquid hydrocarbons on Saturn's moon Titan. Intelligent aliens could, hypothetically, attempt to burn these elements to produce energy.

—How would we give aliens directions to Earth?

—What messages have we sent to aliens?

—What could aliens look like?

Of course, aliens aren't necessarily bound by the same constraints as humans, and our imagination often limits us to thinking in terms of a human timeline. ""It's hard for us to predict what the aliens might do,"" Shostak told Live Science. It's like asking Julius Caesar what he thought the Romans would be doing with oil in 2025, when they were only using small amounts of oil for lamps. ""Julius would probably have some ideas, all based on Roman knowledge,"" he said. ""He would completely miss the [mark]. You have to keep that in mind.""

An intelligent alien civilization could be nothing like what we expect, Shostak added. While aliens would likely need an abundant energy source to advance their civilization, who's to say what form that energy would take? The answer could lie beyond human understanding.

A decade-long study of over 48,000 workers reveals that sticking to optimal lifestyle habits dramatically lowers the risk of several major cancers—especially for those with chronic inflammation.

Study: The association of life's essential 8 scores trajectory patterns with the risk of all cancer types. Image Credit: Harbucks / Shutterstock

The “Life's Essential 8” (LE8) is a comprehensive lifestyle assessment tool designed by the American Heart Association to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by improving lifestyle habits.

A team of researchers from China recently assessed the impact of LE8 score trajectories over time on the risk of cancer among individuals working at a Chinese coal mining company. They found promising outcomes in participants with stably elevated LE8 scores. The study is published in the journal Scientific Reports.

Participants with higher LE8 scores were less likely to have diabetes, high blood pressure, or fatty liver disease at the start of the study.

The “Life's Essential 8” (LE8) covers eight key lifestyle factors: diet quality, physical activity, nicotine exposure, sleep health, body weight, blood glucose, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. LE8-based evaluation and optimization of these factors have been found to significantly reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Since lifestyle habits and risk factors fluctuate over time due to life transitions, health conditions, or aging, a dynamic assessment of lifestyle factors over a long period of time is considered to be a more accurate alternative to single assessments that capture data only at a specific point.

LE8 trajectory modeling—a statistical method using latent mixture models to identify patterns of change over time—is a dynamic tool that monitors individuals' lifestyle and health metrics over time to overcome the limitations associated with clinical decision-making or the development of lifestyle recommendations based on static data.

A growing body of evidence indicates that each LE8 component can profoundly influence the risk factors associated with cancer development and progression. Given these associations, researchers hypothesized that long-term adherence to LE8 guidelines might be more beneficial for cancer prevention than shorter periods of adherence or suboptimal compliance.

With this hypothesis, they designed this study to explore the direct relationship between LE8 score trajectories over time and the risk of incident cancer in a comprehensive, prospective cohort study.

The strongest cancer-preventive effects were seen in people who had both high LE8 scores and elevated levels of inflammation, suggesting lifestyle choices may help offset biological risk.

The study included 48,330 participants from the Kailuan study who underwent three health examinations between 2006 and 2010 to determine their LE8 scores. The Kailuan study is a prospective cohort study conducted in Tangshan, China. Since June 2006, the study has included 101,510 active employees and retirees from the Kailuan Group Co., Ltd., which produces coal and chemical industrial products.

The LE8 scores of the participants were calculated using the algorithm proposed by the American Heart Association for all eight LE8 metrics. Based on their composite scores, participants were categorized into three levels: high, moderate, and low.
Cancer cases were identified using multiple methods, including biennial self-reports, medical reports, and hospital discharge summaries. However, lifestyle data were primarily self-reported, which may introduce recall bias.

The study identified three distinct LE8 score trajectories between 2006 and 2010, including the low-stable, moderate-stable, and elevated-stable trajectories. The low-stable trajectory included 21% of participants with persistently low LE8 scores; the moderate-stable trajectory included 49% of participants with persistently moderate LE8 scores; and the elevated-stable trajectory included 29% of participants with persistently high LE8 scores.

The study identified 2,306 new cancer cases during the 10.39-year (mean) follow-up period. The analysis controlling for potential confounding factors, including age, sex, and lifestyle behaviors, revealed that participants with higher LE8 scores had significantly lower overall cancer risks.

Although LE8 includes diet, the study lacked detailed nutrition data, so researchers used salt and tea consumption as rough indicators of dietary habits.

Specifically, participants from moderate-stable and high-stable trajectories exhibited a 15% and 21% lower risk of overall cancer, respectively, compared to those from the low-stable trajectory.

Regarding specific cancer types, the study found that participants with persistently moderate LE8 scores have 49% and 34% reduced risks of developing breast and liver cancers, respectively, compared to those with persistently low LE8 scores.

Similarly, participants with persistently high LE8 scores exhibited 27%, 51%, 31%, and 39% reduced risks of lung, breast, colorectal, and liver cancers, respectively. However, in sensitivity analyses, the reduced risk for liver cancer in the elevated-stable group was no longer statistically significant after excluding participants using medications (e.g., antihypertensives) or those diagnosed within the first year.

Notably, the study found that the reduced breast cancer risk due to persistently elevated LE8 scores was more pronounced in participants with increased serum C-reactive protein levels (a systemic marker of inflammation). This finding indicates that inflammation can potentially influence the association between LE8 score trajectories and cancer risk.

Air pollution exposure—a known risk factor in industrial settings like coal mining—was analyzed as a potential confounder but did not weaken the link between LE8 and reduced lung cancer risk.

The study finds that maintaining persistently elevated LE8 scores over a period of four years can significantly reduce the overall cancer risk, as well as specific risks against lung, breast, colorectal, and liver cancers.

Similarly, maintaining persistently moderate LE8 scores over the same period has been found to significantly reduce the overall cancer risk, as well as specific risks against breast and liver cancers.

Moderate-to-high LE8 scores indicate a healthy lifestyle characterized by nutrient-rich dietary habits, regular physical activity, and adequate, high-quality sleep. All these factors are vital for maintaining a healthy body weight, blood glucose and cholesterol level, and overall metabolic homeostasis. Such metabolic improvements might be responsible for the inverse association observed between LE8 scores and cancer risk.

Smoking cessation is another critical component of LE8 that can potentially reduce the risk of exposure to carcinogens and, thus, can reduce the risk of cancer development.

However, the study has limitations: the cohort was geographically limited to a single industrial community in China, which may affect generalizability; dietary data were not comprehensively assessed (e.g., specific nutrient intake); lifestyle metrics relied on self-reports, which are subject to recall bias; and critical cancer-specific factors (e.g., reproductive history for breast cancer) were not analyzed. Additionally, LE8 trajectories remained relatively stable over time, potentially reflecting the health-conscious nature of the cohort.

Overall, the study findings underscore the importance of integrating LE8 into public health and clinical strategies for cancer prevention.

On a sunny weekday in Atlanta, a small crowd of people gathered for a rally outside of a labor union headquarters building.

The event, put together by Atlanta-area Democratic U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams, was attended mostly by union members and recently fired federal workers, including Ryan Sloane.

""I was fired by an anonymous email at 9 p.m. in the middle of a holiday weekend,"" he said.

Sloane is still seeking reinstatement, but he feels he no longer has much to lose by speaking out.

""I'm only here today because they cannot fire me twice,"" Sloane said.

When he received his termination notice, he was a few months into a job as a public affairs specialist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

At the CDC, his days were spent updating far-flung local TV, radio, and newspaper journalists about threats such as seasonal flu, measles, and food safety in their communities.

A judge has ordered the reinstatement of some fired federal employees, at least temporarily. But their jobs are still on the line.

Sloane said his former colleagues at the CDC whose jobs aren't yet in limbo are scared.

""They are terrified that their life's work is going to be deleted from servers and not backed up because it does not comport with the ideologies of the new administration,"" he said. ""No one is benefiting from this.""

From the end of January to mid-February, the Trump administration took offline some CDC webpages and froze external communications, including its widely read Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report epidemiological digest.

The webpages that were removed included CDC public health reports, datasets, and guidance on infectious diseases and sexual health. After a court order, some agency information was restored, at least for now.

But even temporary disruptions to CDC communications could have big ripple effects.

It is information that state and local health departments, hospitals, university researchers, and others rely on to help them respond to outbreaks.

""CDC is there to provide technical information, provide funding, provide support, but it's a collaborative work, working together to keep Americans safe,"" said former CDC Director Tom Frieden, who headed the agency from 2009 to 2017. He is now president and CEO of the nonprofit organization Resolve to Save Lives. ""In this country, we have a patchwork or network of public health. It's really up to the local, city, and state health departments to get the job done.""

City and state health agencies also need the collaboration of CDC experts to help investigate local disease outbreaks and other threats to public health.

A clinician who has worked at the agency for more than two decades pointed to the CDC's singular ability to send medical supplies and deploy highly specialized teams of scientists to help local communities identify and contain outbreaks. KFF Health News agreed not to use the clinician's name because she fears she will be fired for airing these views publicly.

""A lot of them are assigned to state and local health departments, so really even beyond individual positions, any funding cuts that the agency takes are also passed on to state and local health departments,"" the clinician said. ""A lot of their budget comes from federal money as well.""

The Trump administration has attempted to terminate hundreds of employees from the CDC alone, along with hundreds more workers at the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies with a U.S. health and safety role.

Many public health and science researchers are concerned about the cuts' impacts on the nation's ability to respond to threats — and about whether state and local public health departments will be able to keep communities healthy without the CDC's partnership.

Billionaire Elon Musk has said his Department of Government Efficiency intends to keep cutting federal agencies' budgets and staff, targeting what it calls ""fraud.""

""Anytime someone gets fired, it's always difficult. But with $36 trillion in debt, we have to reduce the size of the federal government,"" Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene told WABE during a March visit to the Georgia State Capitol.

Her district includes parts of suburban Atlanta about 30 miles from CDC headquarters.

Greene also chairs a House subcommittee also called ""DOGE,"" for ""Delivering on Government Efficiency.""

""Fortunately, with all the investments that are being brought back into the country under President Trump, I really hope that those federal workers are able to find new jobs,"" she said.

She did not comment on whether local public health departments around the country would be able to work efficiently without the support of CDC experts who have been terminated.

But many U.S. public health experts are expressing concern.

The CDC has long been a key training ground for the next generation of U.S. public health researchers.

Emory University epidemiology professor Patrick Sullivan was one of them earlier in his career. The HIV expert previously worked at the CDC for about 15 years.

""When I started working in HIV prevention at CDC in the early 1990s, we didn't have the treatments that essentially allowed people living with HIV to have a full, healthy, normal lifespan,"" he said. ""We didn't have the treatments that essentially allowed people living with HIV to have a test that people could take home to test themselves.""

Sullivan said the progress he has seen over the last several decades gave him optimism, and that advances in HIV treatment and prevention are a great example of the importance of federal support for public health work.

""Discovery science and pharmacy science really have given us the tools that we need to end the HIV epidemic in the United States,"" he said.

But, to have those scientific tools without adequate public health staff or funding to use them, he said, will cost American lives.

Colorado regulators are issuing licenses for providing psychedelic mushrooms and are planning to authorize the state's first ""healing centers,"" where the mushrooms can be ingested under supervision, in late spring or early summer.

The dawn of state-regulated psychedelic mushrooms has arrived in Colorado, nearly two years since Oregon began offering them. The mushrooms are a Schedule I drug and illegal under federal law except for clinical research. But more than a dozen cities nationwide have deprioritized or decriminalized them in the past five years, and many eyes are turned toward Oregon's and Colorado's state-regulated programs.

""In Oregon and Colorado, we're going to learn a lot about administration of psychedelics outside of clinical, religious, and underground settings because they're the first to try this in the U.S.,"" said William R. Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.

Psychedelic mushrooms and their psychoactive compound psilocybin have the potential to treat people with depression and anxiety, including those unresponsive to other medications or therapy. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health, says the risk of mental health problems caused by ingesting mushrooms in a supervised clinical setting is low, but may be higher outside of a clinical setting. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a social media post last year, before his nomination as U.S. health secretary, that his ""mind is open to the idea of psychedelics for treatment.""

Medical experts say more research is needed, particularly in people with a diagnosis or family history of psychotic or bipolar disorder. Adverse effects of psilocybin, including headache and nausea, typically resolve within one to two days. However, extended difficulties from using psychedelics can last weeks, months, or years; anxiety and fear, existential struggle, social disconnection, and feeling detached from oneself and one's surroundings are most common. After the decriminalization and legalization in Oregon and Colorado, psychedelic mushroom exposures reported to poison control centers ticked up in these states and nationally.

In February, about 40 people organized by the psychedelic advocacy group the Nowak Society gathered in Boulder to talk about the coming changes in Colorado. They included Mandy Grace, who received her state license to administer psychedelic mushrooms, and Amanda Clark, a licensed mental health counselor from Denver, who both praised the therapeutic power of mushrooms.

""You get discouraged in your practice because the current therapies are not enough for people,"" Clark said.

Colorado voters approved Proposition 122 in 2022 to legalize natural psychedelics, after Oregon voters in 2020 approved legalizing psilocybin for therapeutic use. Colorado's program is modeled after, but not the same as, Oregon's, under which 21,246 psilocybin products have been sold as of March, a total that could include secondary doses, according to the Oregon Health Authority.

As of mid-March, Colorado has received applications for at least 15 healing center licenses, nine cultivation licenses, four manufacturer licenses, and one testing facility license for growing and preparing the mushrooms, under rules developed over two years by the governor-appointed Natural Medicine Advisory Board.

Psychedelic treatments in Oregon are expensive, and are likely to be so in Colorado, too, said Tasia Poinsatte, Colorado director of the nonprofit Healing Advocacy Fund, which supports state-regulated programs for psychedelic therapy. In Oregon, psychedelic mushroom sessions are typically $1,000 to $3,000, are not covered by insurance, and must be paid for up front.

The mushrooms themselves are not expensive, Poinsatte said, but a facilitator's time and support services are costly, and there are state fees. In Colorado, for doses over 2 milligrams, facilitators will screen participants at least 24 hours in advance, then supervise the session in which the participant consumes and experiences mushrooms, lasting several hours, plus a later meeting to integrate the experience.

Facilitators, who may not have experience with mental health emergencies, need training in screening, informed consent, and postsession monitoring, Smith said. ""Because these models are new, we need to gather data from Colorado and Oregon to ensure safety.""

Facilitators generally pay a$420 training fee, which allows them to pursue the necessary consultation hours, and roughly $900 a year for a license, and healing centers pay $3,000 to $6,000 for initial licenses in Colorado. But the up-front cost for facilitators is significant: The required 150 hours in a state-accredited program and 80 hours of hands-on training can cost $10,000 or more, and Clark said she wouldn't pursue a facilitator license due to the prohibitive time and cost.

To increase affordability for patients in Colorado, Poinsatte said, healing centers plan to offer sliding-scale pay options, and discounts for veterans, Medicaid enrollees, and those with low incomes. Group sessions are another option to lower costs.

Colorado law does not allow retail sales of psilocybin, unlike cannabis, which can be sold both recreationally and medically in the state. But it allows adults 21 and older to grow, use, and share psychedelic mushrooms for personal use.

Despite the retail ban, adjacent businesses have mushroomed. Inside the warehouse and laboratory of Activated Brands in Arvada, brown bags of sterilized grains such as corn, millet, and sorghum and plastic bags of soil substrate are for sale, along with genetic materials and ready-to-grow kits.

Co-founder Sean Winfield sells these supplies for growing psychedelic or functional mushrooms such as lion's mane to people hoping to grow their own at home. Soon, Activated Brands will host cultivation and education classes for the public, Winfield said.

Winfield and co-founder Shawn Cox recently hosted a psychedelic potluck at which experts studying and cultivating psychedelic mushrooms discussed genetics, extraction, and specialized equipment.

Psychedelic mushrooms have a long history in Indigenous cultures, and provisions for their use in spiritual, cultural, or religious ceremonies are included in Colorado law, along with recognition of the cultural harm that could occur to federally recognized tribes and Indigenous people if natural medicine is overly commercialized or exploited.

Several studies over the past five years have shown the long-term benefits of psilocybin for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, and the Food and Drug Administration designated it a breakthrough therapy. Late-stage trials, often a precursor to application for FDA approval, are underway.

Smith said psilocybin is a promising tool for treating mental health disorders but has not yet been shown to be better than other advanced treatments. Joshua Woolley, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of California-San Francisco, said he has seen the benefits of psilocybin as an investigator in clinical trials.

""People can change hard-set habits. They can become unstuck. They can see things in new ways,"" he said of treating patients with a combination of psilocybin and psychotherapy.

Colorado, unlike Oregon, allows integration of psilocybin into existing mental health and medical practices with a clinical facilitator license, and through micro-healing centers that are more limited in the amounts of mushrooms they can store.

Still, Woolley said, between the federal ban and new state laws for psychedelics, this is uncharted territory. Most drugs used to treat mental health disorders are regulated by the FDA, something that Colorado is ""taking into its own hands"" by setting up its own program to regulate manufacturing and administration of psilocybin.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado declined to comment on its policy toward state-regulated psychedelic programs or personal use provisions, but Poinsatte hopes the same federal hands-off approach to marijuana will be taken for psilocybin in Oregon and Colorado.

Winfield said he looks forward to the upcoming rollout and potential addition of other plant psychedelics, such as mescaline. ""We're talking about clandestine industries coming into the light,"" he said.

When Minnesota athletic director Mark Coyle fired Ben Johnson in the middle of the night on March 13, he did so with one candidate in mind to be his next men's basketball coach.

Niko Medved.

And he got his guy.

Medved is leaving Colorado State to be the next coach of the Golden Gophers, sources told CBS Sports. The deal will be announced soon, and a press conference is scheduled for Tuesday, according to a source. Medved is coming off a great 2024-25 season. He took the Rams to the NCAA Tournament, upsetting 5-seed Memphis in the first round and then playing Maryland to the final second before losing on a controversial buzzer-beater by Terrapins star freshman Derik Queen on Sunday night. 

The 51-year-old Medved is a Minneapolis native and Golden Gophers alumnus (1997). He spent the past seven seasons with CSU, guiding the program to the NCAA Tournament three times and winning 143 games. Medved is an established program-builder: He went from nine wins in Year 1 at Furman to 23 in Year 4 before taking the Drake job in 2017 and flipping that school from seven to 17 wins in a year's time. In total, Medved has a 222-172 record in 12 seasons as a head coach. 

Colorado State had a terrific run of player development under Medved: David Roddy, Isaiah Stevens and now Nique Clifford all blossomed into NBA-level players. 

Minnesota will need to seriously invest in its men's basketball program in order to have a chance at sustained success in the Big Ten, let alone nationally. Sources said the program ranked in the bottom two in NIL in the league over the past three seasons.

With CSU's job now open, associate head coach Ali Farokhmanesh is expected to be one of the top candidates to succeed Medved in Fort Collins.

Spring Training games are over, but we're not finished with them quite yet. As teams finalize rosters and come to conclusions about position battles, there's a ton to keep track of across baseball, with just three days left until Opening Day. Let's go through some of the biggest storylines from the last few days of the spring, with a special eye on what Fantasy Baseball players need to know as they either prepare for their drafts or finalize their own rosters ahead of Week 1.

The Red Sox haven't confirmed this one yet, but it's been reported as of Sunday night that Campbell has been informed he has made the team. Campbell hasn't exactly torn the cover off the ball this spring, hitting .174/.304/.283 with a 30.4% strikeout rate, but the Red Sox apparently saw enough from him to pick him as their primary starter at second base. Campbell was a fast riser last season, hitting .330/.439/.558 across three levels of the minors as a 22-year-old, with 20 homers and 24 steals – evidence of the legitimate five-category tools here. There's some risk in his profile because Campbell has only hit at that level for one season, but he passes pretty much every scouting and analytical test you could want and is a consensus top-10 prospect in baseball right now. He should be drafted in every remaining league and should be the biggest priority on waivers for Week 1 if he wasn't already drafted.

We haven't received the official word from the team on this one either, but it sure seems like that's the way they're leaning, per Jim Bowden. Smith didn't enter camp with the hype Campbell did, but he hit .371/.450/.771 and seemingly did everything the Astros wanted to fast-track him to the majors – if he makes his debut Thursday, it'll come after just 32 games as a pro. He was the No. 14 pick in last year's draft, and while his profile isn't quite as Fantasy friendly as Campbell's – he doesn't run much and has had questions about how likely he is to maximize his raw power – but the way Smith won over a smart organization like the Astros has to count for something. He should also be drafted in every league that remains, though I'd certainly put a priority on Campbell.

No, for real. You know the guy on the Dodgers, a stalwart slugger who has mostly held down the hot corner across the last decade of the Dodgers burgeoning dynasty. And now there's another one, who could be the Opening Day second baseman for the Athletics after a broken hamate bone delayed the start of Zack Gelof's season. 

And I think you could make a case for the Athletics' Muncy as having a more Fantasy-friendly skill set in categories leagues than Smith. Smith is the better prospect, of course, but Muncy is coming off a solid season where he hit .277/.374/.491 at Triple-A despite being limited to 58 games with a hand injury, and he should make at least a little bit of an impact on the bases – he has stolen as many as 19 bases in a minor-league season, though he only had five last season. He probably profiles pretty similarly to Gelof, albeit with quieter tools overall, and he's probably worth just a late-round flier in deeper leagues. 

Henderson is still dealing with that intercostal strain from earlier in camp and just wasn't able to get up to speed in time. It's never great when a player is injured to start the season, and it's even worse when it's your first-round pick, but I'm relatively unconcerned about Henderson. It sounds like he's mostly healed at this point and just wasn't able to get into a game before the end of Spring Training – he did face live pitching this weekend, for example. Orioles GM Mike Elias told reporters he hopes Henderson's absence will be measured in ""days, not weeks,"" and there's a very real chance he is back after a minimum IL stay is up, which would be a week after Opening Day. There's some risk that he just never gets going after having his Spring Training derailed, but I'm still willing to take Henderson at the end of the first round. 

Betts' issue is both more straightforward than Henderson's and much less so. He's been dealing with a stomach issue since the Dodgers traveled to Japan, and while he was scheduled to return to the lineup Sunday for an exhibition against the Angels, he was a late scratch. He revealed he hasn't been able to keep any solid food down and is down to 157 pounds from his pre-spring weight of 175 pounds. He has been taking medication and doesn't seem to be concerned, but if the symptoms persist, he will have to undergo further testing, and until he gets it under control might not be able to play. It's possible there won't be any lingering issues here, but losing that much weight and struggling to keep food down could have an impact on Betts' strength and conditioning for the season. Hopefully, Betts gets to the bottom of this with doctors and there are no long-term ramifications, but I think it's appropriate to downgrade Betts to the second round of drafts while this is going on. 

Luckily the injury was not nearly as significant as it looked, because it looked bad – McClanahan delivered a pitch during a game against the Red Sox Saturday and immediately hopped off the mound with his left arm hanging by his side. It turned out to just be a nerve issue in his triceps, and though he'll miss the start of the season, Rays manager Kevin Cash told reporters Sunday it was, ""Probably the best news we could have heard."" There is no timetable for McClanahan's return, but it seems like it could be measured in weeks rather than months, which is good news. It isn't ideal that McClanahan suffered an injury in his third outing back from Tommy John surgery, and I'll drop him to around 55th in my SP rankings for remaining drafts, but we don't have to take him off our boards entirely, thankfully. McClanahan pitched seven innings this spring, striking out eight, walking two, and allowing no runs in his return from a second Tommy John surgery. 

And that's not even counting Connor Norby (oblique) or Vinnie Pasquantino (hamstring), both of whom left games this weekend with injuries of uncertain seriousness. 

Diaz is out, but it seemed like his grip on the closer role was pretty tenuous even before this issue. And, I'll be honest: I'm not even sure this group is worth chasing. The Reds are probably just a .500 team and they play in a tough ballpark, so it isn't the best of circumstances to begin with, and now we're trying to figure which of a bunch of mediocre options will emerge as the closer. Emilio Pagan, Taylor Rogers, and Scott Barlow all have some closer experience, though none are really light's out options; Graham Ashcraft has the stuff to be one, but it'll have to play up a lot better than it did in the rotation, where he was consistently a below-average strikeout pitcher. If I had to speculate on anyone, it would probably be Barlow, but I really don't want to. 

Holliday and Scott both flopped in their first tastes of the majors last season, but they're getting a second chance here. Holliday is the better prospect and higher-upside bet of the two, especially if his new focus on running this spring carries over; he has five steals in 15 games after stealing just four bases in 60 games in his MLB debut. And, for what it's worth, he's making more contact this spring, a potential sign he has overcome his biggest issue as a rookie. He's worth drafting in the top 200 in all leagues.

Scott is more format-dependent, especially since I really don't buy that his four homers in 15 games this spring represent a new normal for him – he had just eight in 134 games between Triple-A and the majors last season. But Scott has difference-making speed and could be among the league leaders in steals if he can manage to be even a tolerable hitter – he had a .179/.219/.283 line in the majors and his just .210 at Triple-A last season, so that's no guarantee. But the stolen base upside makes him worth targeting in all category leagues, at least. 

Also: Keep an eye out for Shane Smith for the White Sox. He hasn't been named to the rotation, but the team is keeping the Rule 5 pick around, and he showed up this spring with increased velocity after putting up a very solid season across Double-A and Triple-A in the Brewers minor-league system last season. There's some interesting SPaRP potential here. 

As a reliever, Holmes was pretty straightforward: He fed you a heavy dose of sinkers, sliders, and sweepers, and almost nothing else. As a starter this spring, he has shown off a full six-pitch mix, adding a cutter, changeup, and four-seamer to the arsenal. I have no idea how sustainable his success this spring will prove, but 23 strikeouts and a 0.93 ERA over 19.1 innings is definitely worth taking notice of. Holmes knew he needed to expand his arsenal to deal with lefties better and get through the order multiple times, and he did just that. It's not enough to make him a must-start Fantasy ace over 19.1 innings, but it's more than enough to make him worth drafting in any and all leagues. That happened fast.

The Boston Red Sox are breaking camp with one of the top prospects in baseball on their big-league roster. Infielder Kristian Campbell has been told he made the team, per MassLive.

The 22-year-old Campbell was drafted out of Georgia Tech in the fourth round in 2023 and has remarkably improved his standing in the organization since. Last season, he rose from High-A (40 games) to Double-A (56 games) to Triple-A (19 games), hitting a combined .330/.439/.558 with 32 doubles, 20 homers, 77 RBI, 94 runs and 24 steals. 

He was ranked as the third-best prospect in all of baseball by R.J. Anderson of CBS Sports back in February. Here's what Anderson had to say: 

Campbell has greatly boosted his stock since being drafted in the fourth round during summer 2023. He trained his bat speed over the winter, empowering him to launch 20 home runs last year after smoking only four during his single season at Georgia Tech. Campbell's added muscle gives him a well-rounded game: he has a good feel for contact and the zone alike; he's an above-average runner; and the Red Sox continue to play him at shortstop, albeit while giving him looks elsewhere on the diamond, too. Campbell already has the appearance of being a draft-day steal. Expect him to continue to enhance that perception in 2025, likely while spending a lot of time in the majors.  

Last season, Campbell played 36 games at shortstop, 36 at second base, 25 in center field and five at third base. 

One might recall that Campbell's name was bandied about early this spring once the Red Sox were known to have signed Alex Bregman. When word broke that the Red Sox wanted to play Bregman at third base, that would leave second open for Campbell, pushing incumbent third baseman Rafael Devers to designated hitter. 

Devers then pushed back, saying he's the third baseman on the team while Bregman said he was open to moving. This would have possibly kept Devers at third and with Bregman playing second, there wouldn't be an open spot for Campbell to play. In the weeks since, Devers has come out and said he's had a change of heart and will do whatever is best for the team. 

As such, it appears the coast is clear for Bregman to play third with Devers at DH and Campbell to try and make his mark as the everyday second baseman. It's always possible he's a part-time player, too, of course, and it'll be interesting to see both how the Red Sox deploy him and how he plays to start his MLB career.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22sports%20news%22%20site%3Acbssports.com","Nikola Jokić injury update: Nuggets star expected to return during upcoming five-game homestand, coach says","https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nikola-jokic-injury-update-nuggets-star-expected-to-return-during-upcoming-five-game-homestand-coach-says/","Mon, 24 Mar 2025 02:13:00 GMT","

The Denver Nuggets should be getting their Serbian superstar back soon. Nikola Jokic, who has missed the last four games, is expected to return to the lineup during the team's upcoming six-game homestand. Denver coach Michael Malone said as much prior to Denver's 116-111 win against the Houston Rockets on Sunday, which Jokić sat out.

""He's going to play in Denver, the five-game homestand,"" Malone said. ""He'll play at some point, hopefully in that five-game homestand. Obviously, he's not playing [Sunday]. I don't think he'll play [Monday]. We're just trying to get home and kind of see where he's at.""

Following Sunday's win, the Nuggets' upcoming home games feature matchups against the Bulls on Monday, Bucks on Wednesday, Jazz on Friday, and a back-to-back against the Timberwolves and Spurs next week.

Jokić's been dealing with a nagging ankle injury for quite some time, but has mostly been playing through it. When he was asked about limping around during the first quarter of Denver's 110-103 loss to the Boston Celtics on March 2, the three-time league MVP said, ""Yeah, I've limped basically the past 14 years."" 

A few games later, when Malone asked Jokić if he wanted to sit out to heal a bit from the ankle and elbow injury he's been dealing with on what would've been the second game of a back-to-back against the Thunder and third game in four days, he responded, ""Hell no.""

While Jokić is persistent in not wanting to sit out games if he's healthy enough to play, he's been putting up some heavy minutes over the last few weeks. Over the last eight games, Jokić is averaging nearly 40 minutes a game, an incredibly taxing workload which only yielded a 4-4 record for the Nuggets during that span. It's obvious that the Nuggets absolutely need Jokić on the floor to win games, which has been increasingly evident over these last four games. They've gone just 2-2 with him sidelined, including a 128-109 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers.

But Denver, now 45-27, also needs Jokić to not be gassed and injured, especially as the playoffs near. In the short term it may cost the Nuggets some wins, especially as the seeding in the Western Conference becomes tighter, but if it means Jokić is closer to 100% when the postseason starts, then you'll take that tradeoff.

Jokic is averaging a triple-double -- 29.1 points, 12.8 rebounds and 10.3 assists per game -- and is one of the favorites for MVP with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder. 

With Sunday's win, the Nuggets hold the No. 3 seed in the West -- one game behind the No. 2 seed Rockets (46-26) and one game ahead of the No. 4 seed Lakers (43-27).

Maryland freshman star Derik Queen saved the day Sunday for his team with a buzzer-beating bank shot from just outside the painted area to lift Maryland past Colorado State and into the Sweet 16 of the 2025 NCAA Tournament. But one of the key pieces of the Terps' ""Crab Five"" might have done some crab-walking to do it.

Queen gathered the inbounds play with 3.7 seconds remaining and went into attack mode from the top of the key. He took two dribbles, gathered and launched into the air off his right foot while fading left, hanging just long enough in mid-air to get a shot that smooched the glass and went in.

The shot fell, the horn sounded, and the game ended: Maryland 72, Colorado State 71.

If only it were that so simple. A closer inspection of the play reveals Queen may have traveled on the play as he attacked the basket. It was not called.

Current NCAA rules allow a gather and two steps. A slow motion view of a separate angle, posted by March Madness and slowed down by me, shows he clearly gathered and subsequently took three steps.

The rub may be what CBS rules analyst Gene Steratore explained as a matter of possession. During halftime of the ensuing Oregon vs. Arizona game, Steratore joined the set of TBS' halftime programming and shot down theories that Queen traveled. 

""By rule, the dribble doesn't end until there's firm possession with one hand locked, but more times than not, with two hands. […] When he brings it back up, we don't know if that's fully possessed. If he bobbles that at that point, he could continue to bobble that basketball all the way to the hoop without a travel. So, you've got to wait until you can define firm possession. […] To me, it just really doesn't jump off the screen as anything big.""

Clark Kellogg, Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith agreed with Steratore, saying they did not notice anything unusual about the play at first blush. As social media lit up with sympathizers to Colorado State's cause that it may have been the victim of a big brand school getting the no-call, Steratore made a reasonable point about an overabundance of information watering down the in-the-moment enjoyment of a sport. 

""Many times now, in this game we love with the technological enhancements […] we're starting to overanalyze things that are natural when we watch them,"" he said. 

However — and here's where I'll lean right into the bit — I'd like the floor back for a moment to just point out that the lower half of Queen's body, regardless of the iffy possession quandary, was unquestionably traveling. 

Here it is below in sequential order. The right foot of Queen strikes first (in first screenshot) after gather; the left foot strikes next (second screenshot); then finally the right strikes again as he launches into air for the shot.

One veteran official spoke with CBS Sports' Matt Norlander after the game and confirmed: Queen traveled. 

Here's another courtside angle of the play so you can decide for yourself. 

Because the first right leg strike and the gather were so close together -- and nearly coincided -- it makes it a nearly impossible call to make in real time.

As always with traveling, though, a caveat: it's only a travel if it's called on the floor.

It wasn't. Now Maryland's dancing, errr, crab walking its way into the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2016.

For Steratore's full perspective, check this video out:

Maryland will play No. 1 seed Florida on Thursday at 7:39 p.m. ET in San Francisco.

Sunday night's Concacaf Nations League final between Mexico and Panama was delayed briefly due to audible anti-gay chants being yelled inside of SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles. In the 82nd minute, a first warning was issued by Concacaf before the game was stopped a couple of minutes later. Play resumed a few minutes after that, and the game was able to conclude with Mexico topping Panama 2-1. 

This marked the third straight year these chants have marred the competition, taking place in the 2023 semifinal between the United States and Mexico as well as the 2024 final between the two sides. 

Mexico would go on to win the game on a late penalty from Raul Jimenez, whose 92nd-minute penalty was his second goal of the game. El Tri won their first-ever Concacaf Nations League with the win. The United States lost to Canada in the third-place game earlier on Sunday.

During previous editions of the Nations League finals, matches involving Mexico have been halted because of the fans' use of the anti-gay chant. El Tri's 2021 semifinal win over Costa Rica was paused for three minutes during a penalty shootout, which ended with several fans being ejected from the stadium. Several days later in the CNL final against the U.S. men's national team, the match once again paused for three minutes during second-half stoppage time. It happened again in 2024.

Ahead of the first Nations League finals in 2021, Concacaf instituted a three-step policy that is in line with FIFA's guidelines on discriminatory language from fans.

At the referee's discretion, a match will first be temporarily stopped upon hearing discriminatory behavior. That pause will be followed by a stadium announcement, as well as a message on in-stadium screens explaining the halt alongside a request to fans to stop using discriminatory language.

If the behavior continues, the referee can then suspend the match and send the teams to the locker room for what the officials deem an appropriate amount of time, a decision that will once again be followed by announcements. The referee's final course of action can be to abandon the match.

Four months after coming out of retirement, Lindsey Vonn returned to the podium on Sunday by earning silver in the super-G at the World Cup Finals in Sun Valley, Idaho. Vonn's podium marks her first since March 2018, and at 40 years old she becomes the oldest woman to ever medal in a World Cup race.

After injuries forced her to retire midway through the 2019 season, Vonn made her return to World Cup competition following partial knee replacement surgery a year ago in an effort to try and end her career on her own terms at the 2026 Olympics in Northern Italy. After finishing fourth and missing out on a podium in St. Anton, Austria, Vonn finished the job in the World Cup Finals with her 138th career podium -- validating her decision to return to make a run at Milan-Cortina next year.

AN INCREDIBLE RUN FOR LINDSEY VONN. 🙌🇺🇸In what is likely her final race on US snow, she finishes ON THE PODIUM in second place at the Stifel Sun Valley World Cup Finals women's super-G! pic.twitter.com/EF5YIVL4cU

""This is the level that I know I can ski, and I know I can even do better than that,"" Vonn told NBC Sports. ""It's been a rough season of people saying that I can't, that I'm too old, that I'm not good enough anymore. I think I proved everyone wrong.

""It's been a long road. I'm doing this because I love it, but that doesn't mean it's been easy. It's been really hard,"" Vonn said. ""This year has just been really up and down, and it's been hard to stay positive sometimes -- especially because people are telling me that I should just quit, again -- but today was just, it meant everything to me.

""This is the road now to Cortina next year. And it's begun, I'm positive, I'm happy. This is why I'm here: So I can ski in front of my home crowd, my family, and do my country proud.""

Over the next 11 months Vonn will seek a fitting end to a career that has seen her become one of the best skiiers in history. Vonn has 82 career World Cup wins -- behind only Mikaela Shiffrin (100) and Ingemar Stenmark (86) -- and three Olympic medals including gold at Vancouver in 2010.

The weekend as a whole in Sun Valley belonged to Italy's Federica Brignone, who clinched the overall championship for this season's women's World Cup after the cancellation of downhill races due to strong winds.

The United States men's national soccer team lost the Concacaf Nations League third-place game 2-1 to Canada on Sunday, ending a horrendous four-day stretch that started with the shock loss to Panama on Thursday in the semifinals. While Patrick Agyemang found the back of the net for the USMNT, it wasn't enough to offset goals from Tani Oluwaseyi and Jonathan David. 

The USMNT needed a response after losing to Panama and they'll end a tournament that they expected to win with more questions than they entered it with. Canadian manager Jesse Marsch may have been red-carded during the second half but he'll be the happier of the two managers after the victory for the Canucks. The USMNT will now have their work cut out for them to find balance ahead of the 2026 World Cup as now the Concacaf Gold Cup, which will take place during the summer of 2025, has become a critical tournament for them.

The new manager feel has now worn off for Mauricio Pochettino as this team needs to win, not only to restore their own confidence but also to live up to the expectations that have been set for them. USMNT star Christian Pulisic was marked out of the match by Canada and no one was able to step up to push the USMNT over the line. It wasn't all bad with Agyemang and Diego Luna showing that they belonged in the squad but defensive miscues and problems for this team have become commonplace over the past few years.

Now that other Concacaf teams aren't afraid of facing the USMNT on home soil, things are becoming tougher by the day. When this team doesn't have their first-choice XI performing, it shows. Moving forward, depth will be needed to progress, especially at the World Cup. With Sergino Dest, Folarin Balogun and Antonee Robinson expected to be available after missing out on CNL, the USMNT have had a major injury issue at almost every tournament that they've taken part in. Depth is needed to cope with that but with just over a year until the World Cup, time isn't on the USMNT's side to cultivate that as Pochettino needs wins now after failing to even get one this month when two were expected. 

It's a disappointing result for the USMNT after they've now lost both games of Concacaf Nations Leauge play. They were outplayed by Canada during the match and plenty of work will need to be done to improve ahead of the World Cup in 2026.

A great ball in from Gio Reyna got knocked down in the box to Diego Luna but St. Clair made a massive save for Canada to maintain their one goal advantage as the clock ticks down. 

Brian White is in at striker but the USMNT is passing between their defenders and struggling to penetrate Canada's defense as this match goes on. After a bright start in the first half for the USMNT, this has been poor. 

Christian Pulisic, Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie will all exit with Tanner Tessmann, Gio Reyna and Yunus Musah incoming. This will be Reyna's first appearance under Pochettino.

It's Jonathan David this time with a great line splitting pass from Ali Ahmed. David drew defenders out of their position before unleashing a wicked shot to beat Turner in net. 

Jesse Marsch is all the way on the pitch to protest Canada not getting a penalty and he now will get a straight red card. Jonathan David went down in the box under his own power with a chance on goal and now Canada will have to go on without their manager.

Marlon Fossey will enter at right back replacing Joe Scally. This is Fossey's first camp under Pochettino as he's a right back who will push the pace more than Scally does from the back.

Still plenty of room for improvement from the USMNT but they'll take being level at the break after poor defense gifted Canada a goal. Diego Luna has been bright in midfield making things happen in space and the USMNT is already playing with more intensity than they showed against Panama but things need to be cleaner. Putting together more cohesive attacking movements could see this match get out of sight quickly. 

There it is, after winning the ball back, Tim Weah plays Diego Luna into space and Patrick Agyemang wouldn't miss from in front of net. This is one that will be a huge sigh of relief for this team.

After a turnover in midfield, the ball eventually squirted to Canadian striker Tani Oluwaseyi. David had the first chance but that's the type of goal that the USMNT shouldn't be conceding as someone needs to take control and clear the ball out of the box.

While the chance was offside, he was there to stop Kone's chance in the box. After not seeing much action facing Panama, it's clear that Matt Turner will be tested today.

Alphonso Davies came into the match with a knock and he'll now exit before playing 15 minutes. It's a big loss for Canada as Niko Sigur will replace him in the lineup. Alistair Johnston will move over to left back after the shift.

Mark McKenzie was there to clean things up but Jonathan David and Tajon Buchanan were able to get into space. It has been a stop and start match so far.

There are a few fouls going back and forth as each team wants to show their physical side in the early stages of the game. It could be a matter of time until a yellow card pops out for persistent infringement.

This may not be the Conacacaf Nations Leauge final but as Jesse Marssch and Mauricio Pochettino meet, this will be a very important match.

In a close fought match, depth will work in the USMNT's favor as they'll have just enough in the tank to win this one late. Pick: USMNT 2, Canada 1

Speaking of balance, an easy way to get some of that back is with a back four including players in their natural positions. Joe Scally was mostly fine as a third center back or left back, but Yunus Musah as a wing back left much to be desired on the creative front. It's not a knock to Musah, because that's not his game, but when USMNT systems have relied on fullbacks pushing the pace no matter who the manager is, it would be good to let the fullbacks be fullbacks and trust that the midfield can cover for any mistakes that happen because of that.

With Tyler Adams back, the USMNT has a lot of room for error defensively because with his awareness on the pitch, he has no issues adjusting and filling space when needed. There was a sequence early where Chris Richards lost the ball and in seconds Adams was there to make a defensive intervention to make sure it didn't end up in a goal. Being guaranteed to have one of the best midfielders on the pitch in any Concacaf match, there's no need to approach a match in a conservative manner because that allows teams to feel like they are still in the game which is when goals like Panama's stunning winner can happen.

The USMNT has to come out of the gate quickly and force errors from their opposition before they can settle into a match. It's easy to forget how much ground Adams can cover because of how long he has been in and out with injuries over the past few years, but with him back and healthy, it's a good chance for the USMNT to use his strengths to up the tempo in attack.

While Canada have been performing like one of Concacaf's best teams, defeating the United States is critical for them to truly be treated like one of the best in the region. Like the USMNT, most of their top players are now in major European leagues, but these matches are critical because after struggling at the 2022 World Cup, it's up to Marsch to show that this time will be different. If Canada can build on a strong showing at the Copa America by defeating the United States, it could truly begin to signal a shift in power.

After a disappointing match versus Panama, Mauricio Pochettino has rang in the changes to the starting XI. With six changes it's an XI that will be poised to show what they can do on the big stage.

USMNT Starting XI: 1-Matt Turner; 2-Cameron Carter-Vickers, 4-Tyler Adams, 5-Max Arfsten, 8-Weston McKennie, 10-Christian Pulisic (Capt.) 14-Diego Luna; 16-Patrick Agyemang, 19-Joe Scally, 20-Mark McKenzie, 21-Tim Weah

Substitutes: 18-Patrick Schulte, 3-Chris Richards, 6-Yunus Musah,7-Gio Reyna, 9-Josh Sargent, 11-Tanner Tessmann, 12-Jack McGlynn, 13-Tim Ream, 17-Marlon Fossey, 23-Brian White

Pressure will be on the USMNT to perform today after losing to Panama and Mauricio Pochettino has rang in the changes with only five players keeping their spots in the starting XI to face Canada. Patrick Agyemang will get a chance to lead the line for the USMNT while Diego Luna also comes into the midfield as the road to the 2026 World Cup continues.

DERIK QUEEN, THE (4) MARYLAND TERRAPINS, AND THE REST OF THE MEN'S BASKETBALL SWEET 16 

If you thought the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament was lacking a signature moment, I sure hope you kept watching all the way through. Derik Queen hit a buzzer-beating bank shot to lift (4) Maryland over (12) Colorado State, 72-71, in the game of the tournament so far. 

Queen is awesome, a skilled 6-foot-10 freshman who Matt Norlander profiled earlier this season. Did he travel on the game winner? Maybe. But it wasn't called, so it's not a travel. Regardless, it shouldn't lessen your excitement, Maryland fans. It's the first true game-winning buzzer beater in the NCAA Tournament since the 2023 Final Four and Maryland's first in the NCAA Tournament since Drew Nicholas in 2003. 

Colorado State's Jalen Lake had just hit a go-ahead 3, and Queen turning desperation to elation is what makes March so great. 

Here's where Queen's shot ranks among March Madness' best buzzer-beaters, and you already know where he landed in Sunday's winners and losers. 

So, who else is left? First, all four No. 1 seeds are into the Sweet 16, headlining a somewhat chalky tournament so far. How they got there, though, is impressive. 

From the best seeds remaining to the worst, John Calipari apparently doesn't mind having his worst seed ever. His (10) Arkansas Razorbacks are into the Sweet 16 after upsetting Rick Pitino's (2) St. John's, 75-66, and what a twist it is in Calipari's long and complicated legacy, Matt Norlander writes. 

Not to be outdone, Calipari's most recent former employer, (3) Kentucky, also reached the second weekend after an 84-75 win over (6) Illinois. Isaac has the inside story on Lamont Butler leading the way. 

Here's the Sweet 16 schedule: 

You'll notice a lot of SEC teams -- seven, to be exact, a record for any conference. You'll also notice not a lot of conferences: just four are represented, the fewest ever. Here's our early preview of a LOADED slate. 

And here's more from the weekend that was: 

THE (8) UCONN HUSKIES AND THE (2) ST. JOHN'S RED STORM 

There are many reasons no men's college basketball team has three-peated since John Wooden's UCLA over 50 years ago. But this year's Huskies -- without the superb guard play or dominant interior presence of the past two iterations -- tried their darnedest, didn't they? Dan Hurley's club went down swinging, Chip writes, and here's what an emotional Hurley said postgame. 

The most notable moment of Pitino's postgame presser, meanwhile, was his terse explanation of why Big East Player of the Year RJ Luis Jr. didn't play down the stretch. Still, Pitino led a stirring return to prominence for the Johnnies, and his ability to take them to the next level will depend on NIL support, David writes. 

Half of the women's Sweet 16 is set, and so far Cinderella is yet to show up. Here are some of the more notable results: 

Injuries, unfortunately, might be the biggest storyline. JuJu Watkins appears to have dodged a scare, and the same goes for Olivia Miles. Toby Fournier, however, is dealing with an illness, and it's unclear if she'll be back for (2) Duke's Sweet 16 game. 

We're keeping up with every game right here as the rest of the Sweet 16 will be set today.  

George Foreman, the legendary heavyweight boxer who was so much more, too, died Friday at the age of 76. 

Where do we even start? The boxing is a good place. Foreman won Olympic gold in 1968 and won his first heavyweight title by beating Joe Frazier -- ""Down goes Frazier!"" -- in 1973. A year later, Foreman lost to Muhammad Ali in ""The Rumble in the Jungle,"" his first career loss. Foreman retired in 1977 after losing to Jimmy Young.  

Then, in 1987, he returned at 38 years old. In 1994, at 45, he defeated Michael Moorer to become the oldest man ever to win a heavyweight boxing championship. He finished his career with a 76-5 record and 68 knockouts. He leaves behind an incredible legacy in the ring as one of the all-time greats who co-authored some of the all-time great fights. 

But he also authored a great life -- one I didn't know much about before reading this marvelous story by Brian Campbell. After the loss to Young, Foreman suffered exhaustion, heatstroke and hallucinations and, after surviving, became a born-again Christian and, eventually, an ordained minister. He only returned to boxing when his church was struggling financially. And, still, that's only part of his incredible story.

INGLEWOOD, Calif. – It was hard not to sense some version of optimism as the U.S. men's national team gathered in the Los Angeles area last week ahead of the Concacaf Nations League semifinal, a tournament that they were the only previous winners of. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino had spent the previous week telling media members in London, the city he has long lived in, that the U.S. could be the world's best team within the next decade in a refrain that matched the ambitious vibes he has brought to the job since the moment he stepped into it last fall. 

By the time the week wrapped up, Pochettino was instead encouraging USMNT fans not to feel pessimistic as they notched two successive losses in the CNL, capping off a rough week with a 2-1 loss to Canada at SoFi Stadium on Sunday. There was an argument to be made after Thursday's 1-0 loss to Panama in the semifinals that the U.S. outplayed the opposition, but that was not necessarily the case against Canada. Despite facing a Canada side that prefers a more open and dynamic playing style, the USMNT managed just five shots – fewer than the 12 they mustered against a defense-focused Panama – and only strung together 0.74 expected goals. Neither outing was particularly impressive, forcing Pochettino to do some damage control.

""I want to send a message to the fans. Don't be pessimistic and don't get bad feelings,"" Pochettino said on Sunday after the defeat to Canada. ""The process is always is painful when you lose, but we need to accept [it], but I don't want that the people feel pessimistic. Disappointed, we all are, and the fans need to feel the disappointment that we didn't win.""

He followed that up with a promise.

""We're going to find a way to perform.""

Pochettino and his players were in agreement that things need to change, arguing that this week's results force a period of reflection before they reconvene in June for a pair of friendlies and the Gold Cup, which marks their final competitive games before next year's World Cup. It was hard to point the finger towards one particular issue, which may not come as a surprise considering how the last few days have panned out for this group.

The head coach, for example, wondered aloud if he may need to try something different during his training camps but he remains focused on establishing a competitive edge before layering in tactical ideas. He said he was ""happy with the attitude [of] all the players,"" but also accused them of being on autopilot during these games.

""When that is not your habitat, you can stand for a period of time but you cannot be consistent,"" he said. ""We realize that the way that we competed against Panama wasn't good, but after, we talked [about] how to change the automatic pilot. You go and to try to survive in the way that you will be safe and you come back to your habit. When it's not your normal habit, yes, you are conscious. I am thinking, 'I need to go, I need to press.' When we don't have the ball but when we have the ball, I want, 'I need to change the tempo. I need to go forward.'""

Christian Pulisic echoed that statement, especially as it pertains to the differences in the USMNT's and Panama's performances on Thursday – even if he thinks discussion about intensity levels is somewhat lazy.

""It's just the easiest thing to say after a loss, is to say they were more aggressive and have more heart,"" Pulisic said. ""I definitely see it, especially in Panama, what it means to them, for sure. It's like their everything, it's the biggest game so that's definitely something that we can honestly learn from.""

Tyler Adams, meanwhile, singled out inconsistent individual outings as something that prevents the USMNT from stringing together impressive collective performances.

""I think there just needs to be a collective of better individual performances. I think when you have good individual performances in international football, usually it breeds something,"" Adams said. ""You can find someone to support, you can find positivity within the team and I think that when you start to combine those individual performances, it leads to a good team one.""

The CNL matches were always going to offer a valuable progress report on the state of the USMNT as they prepared for the 2026 World Cup on home soil, which many are hoping will be a transformative moment for the growth of soccer in the country. The focal point of that growth plan is a U.S. team that puts together a statement-making performance, and while Pochettino's first months on the job had gone well, this month's games have forced many to reconsider what this group's true ceiling is.

This version of the USMNT is meeting a lot of the traditional markers of success in a way that their predecessors have not. The majority of the core roster is based in Europe, with 11 players competing in this season's edition of the UEFA Champions League – a new record for USMNT players. Some, like Christian Pulisic and Antonee Robinson, are easily amongst the best players in their leagues. Many of the players, though, are squad players for their club teams and a notable handful like Matt Turner and Gio Reyna have struggled for years to earn regular playing time. There's a real argument to be made that their inconsistency has stunted their growth and that this promising group has not actually made meaningful strides since the 2022 World Cup.

There are some champagne problems that come with the USMNT players' moves to Europe – they had to deal with the fatigue of lengthy flights from the continent to Los Angeles last week and the scheduling of the first game on Thursday meant they could only squeeze in three training sessions. Combined with the fact that they were missing many key players through injury like Robinson, Sergino Dest and Folarin Balogun, though, these are obviously un-ideal circumstances for a team to build a new identity under a new tactician. They continue to trust the process, however new it may be, because there's a huge task at hand.

""The journey that we're on is growing the sport in America,"" Adams said. ""If you want to be negative about what we want to build and where we're trying to take it, the sport won't grow -- that's the bottom line. We're kind of trying to be the catalyst in doing that and with that, you need to have success so to give people optimism, obviously. I think for us, we need to make a bigger effort and [be] a team where people can get behind and support, whether it's through passion, whether it's through an amazing style of play, whether it's through winning games, scoring amazing goals, whatever it is, but winning breeds that optimism for sure.""

Pochettino also said that dealing with growing pains now is preferable to experiencing them next year.

""We need to change and i think I am not going to say I am happy,"" he said. ""Don't take me wrong, but if something's negative about [the] result, [there's] something to learn. It's better now because I think we have time...In this situation, in one year's time, for sure I will tell you, 'Houston, we have a problem'...In one year, [if] we are talking about that, it's because we have a big problem and we were not capable to discover and to try to decide on the best strategy and to provide to the team the capacity to play in a different way. I think we have time and I prefer that happen today and not in one year.""

There is an argument to be made that the USMNT will learn meaningful lessons from this disappointing outing at the CNL Finals, though many years have passed without this group demonstrating that they have moved out of the learning stage. With around 15 months to go until their opening game of the World Cup, the clock is ticking.

Many things went wrong for the USMNT over the last week, but there was one person who earned universal praise on Sunday – midfielder Diego Luna. After stints in the 2024 and 2025 January camps designed for MLS players, the 21-year-old midfielder earned a call-up with the full squad for this camp and started against Canada, notching the assist to Patrick Agyemang's first half goal. Pochettino singled him out as one of the standout players on Sunday and cited him as an example of what he wants to see from players.

""Diego Luna played well,"" he said. ""The desire and the [hunger] that he showed is what we want and that is not to say nothing against the rest of the people. It's only one example. When I told [him] today, 'You are going to play,' he was ready.""

Pulisic was just as positive about Luna, who he played with for the first time at the international level on Sunday.

""He's an awesome kid, man,"" Pulisic said about Luna. ""He's got a really bright future. You can see it today. He brings a little something different. He's got heart and I love the way he plays and like I said, he's got a big future ahead.""

It is an impressive upward trajectory for Luna, who was left off the U-23 USMNT's Olympics roster last summer and declined the opportunity to be an alternate while leaving the door open to represent Mexico in the wake of that decision. He came with his own motivation to this month's games, which resulted in him being cap-tied to the USMNT.

""Not having my name be out there and not playing in Europe yet, stuff like that,"" Luna said as he discussed his mindset heading into camp. ""I think the route that I've taken is very different than a lot of players, from academy to USL to MLS to not playing and now starting and honestly, I think it's been a different route and I've always got a chip on my shoulder.""

He also snuck in a comment that one would guess is music to Pochettino's ears.

""I think for me, it's coming from a difficult background and having to fight for everything I've earned,"" Luna said. ""I think it's easy for me to say that I'm looking for more, working for more and to provide my family, for my son, for my mom, dad, all these types of things so I think it's just that and to be able to play for the crest. I don't know what other motivation you need, right? I think it's the biggest step in soccer to play for your country.""

Before you tune in to Sunday's final match, you need to see the Concacaf Nations League picks from SportsLine soccer expert Martin Green. After working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Last year, he was profitable in multiple areas on his soccer picks, including Euro qualifying (+6.30 units), the EFL Cup (+4.47), the FA Cup (+3.07) and the Champions League (+3.05) among others.

For Mexico vs. Panama, Green is backing Mexico to win to nil for a +160 payout (risk $100 to win $160). El Tri have been at a disadvantage playing against a strong USMNT side in the last few Nations Leagues, and they have a better chance at victory going up against the Panamanians.  Mexico dominates the head-to-head, winning 13 of 15 meetings against Los Canaleros dating back to 2013 and drawing in the other two matches. When these teams last met in the Nations League semifinals a year ago, El Tri secured a comfortable 3-0 victory thanks to goals from Edson Álvarez, Julian Quiñones and Orbelín Pineda.  Meanwhile, the Panamanians are still dealing with a plethora of injuries that has decimated their starting XI. They were fortunate to get a goal past the USMNT on Thursday, but it could be difficult for lightning to strike again -- especially since they have been clean-sheeted by Mexico in four straight meetings.  ""Mexico have a much stronger starting XI and greater strength in depth, and they also have a superb record against Panama, so they should grind out a relatively low-scoring win on Sunday,"" Green told SportsLine.

Filed under:

Seattle Storm forward Alysha Clark — the league's oldest player at 37 years old — had no doubts about continuing her WNBA career this season. 





With Diana Taurasi's retirement now official, Seattle Storm forward Alysha Clark is now the WNBA's oldest player. Clark, who is 37 years old, spent the last two years with the Las Vegas Aces before returning to the Storm in the offseason. 

In an interview with SB Nation last week, Clark revealed the key to her longevity and continued high-level play, noting she never considered retirement this offseason. While she's only averaged double-digits once in her 12-year WNBA career, she's managed to keep her production consistent. 

In her WNBA career, Clark has averaged 6.9 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 1.5 assists on 48.5% shooting and 38.3% from three. Her numbers last season largely mirror those career averages; she averaged 6 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 1.8 assists, shooting 44.3% from the field and 37.3% from three. The year prior, she was awarded the WNBA Sixth Player of the Year award. 

Clark told SB Nation that she attributes her ability to extend her career far beyond when most professionals have to two things: her love for the game, and her preparation. 

“The way that I approach what I'm doing is from a very consistent and disciplined level,” she said. 

She also noted she's prioritized recovery, especially in recent years. 

“I don't think it's emphasized enough,” she said. “When I was coming up through the sport, it was, ‘if you're not broken, you're fine' and understanding as I got, as I've gotten older, that that's actually not the healthiest way to approach it.”  

Clark was drafted by the San Antonio Stars in the second round in 2010 and was subsequently waived. She played overseas in Israel, Turkey, and Poland for a few years, before officially beginning her WNBA career with the Seattle Storm in 2012. 

She played on the Storm for 9 years, winning two championships (in 2018 and 2020), before signing with the Washington Mystics. After a brief tenure in DC, she joined the Aces, where she won another championship in 2023. 

Ahead of the season with the Mystics, she suffered a Lisfranc injury to her right foot while playing overseas in France, which required surgery and kept her out of the 2021 season. 

In hindsight, the Storm forward believes that the injury was a blessing in disguise and that the time off was good for her in the long term.  

“I think that helped prolong my career, to be honest,” she said. “And I give all the credit to the physical therapists that I worked with in DC during that time — because that's who did it for me.”

This offseason, Clark explored her options as a free agent. She said she never doubted wanting to continue her WNBA career despite being the oldest player in the league. 

“I don't feel slow in any area,” she said. “My mind is still sharp. My body still feels good before and after games — so I'll take it.” 

Clark isn't the only impactful 37-year-old in the WNBA. The Indiana Fever's DeWanna Bonner is also 37, while Sami Whitcomb (Phoenix Mercury), Tina Charles (Connecticut Sun), and Courtney Vandersloot (Chicago Sky) are all 36 years old. Taurasi, who officially announced her retirement last month, was 42 years old when she decided to hang it up for good. 

Clark noted that her longevity is also a result of WNBA teams still wanting her. 

“For me, it's about opportunity as well,” she said. “Like, I'm grateful that teams still want me — and players still want to play with me and see my value. And then, I'm just healthy enough to be able to continue to play at this level. I don't want to get to a point where I don't feel like myself. If that's the case. I'll definitely know it's time to walk away.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22tennis%20news%22%20site%3Abbc.com","Second Serve: What's happening with Carlos Alcaraz and how Alexandra Ebala is blazing a trail","https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c99ndz11dj1o","Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:46:01 GMT","

In the second edition of Second Serve, a weekly snapshot of the tennis tour, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko looks at the talking points from Miami.

In a week where the appetite for revolution has been the hot topic in the tennis world, there is a need to consider evolution for one of the sport's leading young players. 

The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) launching a lawsuit against the governing bodies has largely overshadowed what has happened on court at the Miami Open.

So let's shine a light on Carlos Alcaraz - and the soul-searching he will look to do before starting his European clay-court season - after a surprise early exit to Belgian veteran David Goffin.

Sometimes it is easy to forget how young Alcaraz is given the success he has already achieved.

Bumps in the road are inevitable for a player who does not turn 22 until the start of May - even if he has already won four Grand Slam titles.

That does not stop the inquest, though, after the Spaniard's second straight defeat.

'A poor level from me' - Alcaraz out in Miami second round

Players v tennis tours: why the lawsuit and what next?

Having received a first-round bye, world number three Alcaraz was completely out of sorts - making a host of sloppy mistakes which pointed to a drop in concentration and confidence.

It was a similar story in his Indian Wells semi-final defeat by Britain's Jack Draper just six days earlier.

Four losses in 19 matches - in a season which has included a title win in Rotterdam  - does not suggest the panic button should be pressed yet.

But the pattern of Alcaraz's losses raises concerns. Dominant sets showcasing his shot-making and athleticism are outweighed by ones where he displays vulnerability and nervousness.

The aura of invincibility which he had developed has dropped a notch. Now he's seen as beatable.

Coming from a country with little tennis pedigree, Alexandra Eala is already accustomed to being a trailblazer for the Philippines - even though she is still only 19.

In 2021, Eala became the first Filipino to win a WTA Tour match and the first to win a junior Grand Slam crown with the 2022 US Open title.

The triumph even led to the teenager gracing the cover of Vogue back home.

Now she has announced herself to a wider global audience, having beaten Australian Open champion Madison Keys to reach the Miami last 16.

""It's a big thing to take in,"" said Eala, who has jumped 23 places in the live WTA rankings to a career-high 117th.

""I'm so super proud of what I was able to accomplish, but it definitely fuels me more.""

Next she faces Spanish 10th seed Paula Badosa and another eye-catching win will put her into the top 100.

All eyes remain on Miami.

The combined ATP Masters and WTA 1,000 event - played in the tier of tournaments below the four majors - hits the business end this week. 

With Alcaraz, Draper and Daniil Medvedev among a host of top-10 seeds already out, the men's draw has opened up and thrown up the possibility of another first-time Masters champion.

Or it could be Novak Djokovic...

Having cut a forlorn figure after a ""bad day in the office"" at Indian Wells, the 24-time major champion has looked more like his old self in Miami.

Biggers tests await than Australia's Rinky Hijikata and Argentine lucky loser Camilo Ugo Carabelli - starting with Italy's Lorenzo Musetti in the last 16 -  but he is certainly sharper having benefitted from more time on the court.

The top four seeds remain in the women's draw - Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula, as does defending champion Danielle Collins.



Alcaraz's struggle to find consistency demonstrates - if we didn't already know - how hard it is for the world's leading players to replicate their best every week.

Jack Draper received a reminder in Miami, too.

Fresh from lifting the Indian Wells title, the British men's number one was brought back down to earth with an opening defeat by talented Czech 19-year-old Jakub Mensik.

More positively, Emma Raducanu answered some of the sceptics with an impressively gritty win over eighth seed Emma Navarro and is aiming to reach the quarter-finals of a WTA 1,000 event for the first time.

The warp-speed rise of Jacob Fearnley is showing no signs of stopping yet.

As we keep reminding you, the 23-year-old was still a university student in the United States this time last year and ranked outside of the world's top 500.

Now he has provisionally become the British men's number two - overtaking former world number eight Cameron Norrie - and is on course to become a top-75 player when the rankings are updated next week.

Norrie has plummeted outside the top 80 as his struggles continue, while Dan Evans - playing this week at an ATP Challenger in Naples - is on the verge of dropping out of the top 200. 

With so many professional tennis tournaments taking place across the world, and across so many levels, it can be hard to keep up with everything from one week to the next.

As part of BBC Sport's commitment to offer more for tennis fans, Second Serve will be your weekly round-up of the biggest stories in the sport.

As well as the main talking point, you can see which ATP and WTA players are making significant progress - or struggling for form, how the British contingent are doing and what the next stops on the calendars are.

Hilaria Baldwin planned to end her relationship with Alec Baldwin if his eldest daughter, Ireland Baldwin, didn't approve.

During the Sunday, March 23, episode of TLC's The Baldwins, Hilaria, 41, reflected on her bond with Ireland, 29,.”I feel like it is unique for a stepmom and stepdaughter relationship.” she said. “First of all, I am 11 years older than her, I didn't raise her and we find tremendous humor in that.”

Hilaria valued Ireland's opinion when she first started dating her father.

“Before I was her stepmother, when I met her I told Alec, ‘If she doesn't like me, I am not staying,'” she revealed. “I [was] not going to be the wicked stepmother. My place in life is not to come into a family and cause problems.”



Hilaria said she had “too much respect for the family” to cause issues, adding, “[Ireland] immediately welcomed me and we have never fought and it is so easy.”

Before finding love with Hilaria, Alec, 66, was married to Kim Basinger from 1993 to 2002. Their divorce was finalized after a bitter custody dispute that later caused tension between Alec and Ireland. They were able to work out their differences and Ireland has since become close to Alec and Hilaria — and the couple's seven kids: Carmen Gabriela, 11, Rafael Thomas, 9, Leonardo Ángel Charles, 8, Romeo Alejandro David, 6, Eduardo “Edu” Pao Lucas, 4, María Lucía Victoria, 4, and Ilaria Catalina Irena, 2.

On Sunday's episode, Hilaria also elaborated on her first meeting with Alec.

“Obviously our age difference is there. I am always insecure. Even when I had dinner with him, I felt like it was a big deal that someone was bringing me out,” she recalled. “I was in the land of splitting the check and it was a big deal that he paid. I didn't take that lightly.”

She continued: “Then he texted me asking, ‘What do you think about dating someone 26 years older than you?' What I appreciated about him was that he was very into consent. He asked to kiss me for the first time.”

According to Alec, Hilaria previously dated men “who were age appropriate” for her. “She was very young so they were very young,” he told the cameras. “I would meet them and be like, ‘I get it. They are very handsome and very super fit.'”

Hilaria valued good appearance in a potential partner because of her plans for children.

“I wanted to have my kids and I wanted them to look good. I wanted to have a baby with a good looking guy. It could have been anybody, you were just the first good looking guy who walked up to me,” she quipped before being asked by producers if she dated other actors. “I wouldn't date an actor when he was an actor. I dated an actor who went on to be on Broadway and we went and saw him naked.”

Alec poked fun at how he attended Broadway's Take Me Out to see “the love” of Hilaria's life, which she denied. The meeting got even more awkward when Alec saw Hilaria's ex naked after the musical.

“He is there and he turns out with his personality hanging out,” Alec revealed. “He had like a clarinet hanging from his pants.”

The Baldwins airs on TLC Sundays at 10 p.m. ET.

As if that kiss between Sam Nivola and Patrick Schwarzenegger on The White Lotus wasn't weird enough, the show pushed the incest subplot further by having the brothers engage in a moment of sexual intimacy.

During the Sunday, March 23, episode of the hit HBO series, Saxon (Schwarzenegger) and Lochlan (Nivola) have different reactions after their night of drugs, alcohol and sex. Saxon slowly started to remember exactly what happened, which is when he realized Lochlan was the one who slept with Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon).

Saxon, meanwhile, was in the same bed and getting pleasured by none other than his own brother. Yep, you read that right. And if you didn't see it the first time,, The White Lotus made sure to flashback three separate times during the episode to the moment when Lochlan was touching Saxon in a sexual manner.

While Saxon just wanted to forget, the situation got worse when Chloe brought it up to Saxon, who pretended he didn't remember even though no one believed him.



Before The White Lotus crossed an incest boundary they can't come back from, Nivola, 21, opened up about the confusing tension between his and Schwarzenegger's characters.

“We didn't really talk about it at all until we shot the scene. My character's big turning point is that moment at the end of episode 5,” Nivola told GQ earlier this month after the brothers initially shared a kiss on screen. “We shot it a few different ways, and we talked about it a lot. I think at the end of the day, it was supposed to just be like they're all really f—ed up, and, of course, kissing your brother is incredibly wrong and weird and gross. But I think as is the case with The White Lotus, it's like these crazy actions and sort of heightened reality coming from really real emotions that are actually really relatable to your everyday guy.”

Nivola called the scene “really complicated” from his character's perspective.

“He just is desperate for his brother's approval, and he's out doing this partying drug thing with Saxon, which is a thing that Saxon keeps talking about, and all he talks about is sex. He's like, ‘Sex is the main point of life. You need to get laid. That's what you need,'” he explained. “I'm like, ‘OK. Well, in this charged sexual environment, what can I do to make you notice me and get you to approve of me?' And then, he does the wrong thing to make that happen.”

Le Bon, 38, meanwhile, recalled Schwarzenegger, 31, needing some encouragement, telling Vulture, “I think for Patrick it was really difficult. For Sam, he was kind of like, ‘It's whatever, let's just do it well one time and it will be over.' Because if you don't do it well the first time, then you have to do it over and over again.”

She continued: “We all thought he was going to throw up. And Sam was like, ‘It's fine, it's just a kiss, calm down!'”

Elsewhere in Sunday's episode, Chloe attempted to hide her threesome from Gary a.k.a Greg (Jon Gries). Her boyfriend didn't seem to mind her potentially sleeping with someone else as he was more focused on a gathering he was planning — that he really wanted Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) to attend — for unclear reasons.

Kate (Leslie Bibb), Laurie (Carrie Coon) and Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan) ended up at odds after their night out with Valentin (Arnas Fedaravicius). Married Jaclyn specifically had a lot to answer for after sleeping with Valentin.

Finally, there was Rick (Walton Goggins) who reunited with Frank (Sam Rockwell) on their quest to maybe or maybe not murder Sritala's (Lek Patravadi) husband and the Ratliff's continued to fall apart with Timothy (Jason Isaacs) once again not telling his family about the fact that they are now all broke.

New episodes of The White Lotus air on HBO Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.

Nothing was off limits during Drake Bell and Josh Peck's first public conversation in decades.

During the Monday, March 24, episode of Peck's “Good Guys” podcast, the former costars reflected on the evolution of their friendship, revealing where they stand now after a public falling out.

“I have my perspective,” Bell, 37, began, “Especially because we were going through this, like, during our adolescence and when we were changing and learning. It's going to be interesting to see what my perspective was and what your perspective was and if they align at all. “I would say there were times when we hung out a lot and we were close and then there were times when — not for any reason — but just we weren't.”

Bell recalled moments when he and Peck weren't on great terms, adding, “There were times where it was like, we might not have been getting along. But I think we were dealing with a lot of s– outside of our relationship or outside of us working together.”



Viewers were introduced to Bell and Peck, 38, as a comedic duo when they played stepbrothers on Drake & Josh in 2004. After three years on the show, their friendship fizzled as they branched out to new projects. Tension arose in 2017 when Bell wasn't invited to Peck's wedding to Paige O'Brien.

It wasn't until March 2024 when Bell revealed he was a victim of dialogue coach Brian Peck‘s (no relation to Josh) abuse in Investigation Discovery's four-part docuseries Quiet on Set that he and Josh were able to readdress their issues.

Josh showed his support for Bell that same month with a public statement, which read, “I finished the Quiet On Set documentary and took a few days to process it. I reached out to Drake privately, but wanted to give my support for the survivors who were brave enough to share their stories of emotional and physical abuse on Nickelodeon sets with the world.”

He continued: “Children should be protected. Reliving this publicly is incredibly difficult, but I hope it can bring healing for the victims and their families as well as necessary change to our industry.”

They covered the topic on Monday's podcast. Keep reading for more:


Josh and Bell met on the set of The Amanda Show in 2000, which paved the way for their own series on Nickelodeon. Off screen, however, Bell was dealing with sexual abuse that ultimately resulted in Brian being arrested in August 2003. The 11 charges brought against Brian included oral copulation, sodomy and forcible penetration. He pleaded no contest to two charges of child sexual abuse and was sentenced to 16 months in prison and had to register as a sex offender.

“That big break between Drake & Josh and The Amanda Show is when I told my mom what was going on. We went to the police, there was the investigation and all the stuff that you saw in the documentary. That was when all of that was going on,” Bell recalled on Monday. “Then when we shot the pilot, we were in the middle of the investigation. But nobody had known anything because Brian hadn't been arrested. So I had to come back from The Amanda Show — where Brian worked and where the abuse was happening.”

Bell admitted that he was preoccupied with concerns about Brian.

“That's the only place I feel comfortable is when I get to set and hang out with you guys. … That's where I feel safe, but it sucks because [it didn't feel safe with him],” he continued. “I'm coming back and he hasn't been arrested. He came and visited during the pilot. I still had to play like, ‘Oh, hey. We are cool. Like, you're about to get arrested, bro. And you don't even know.' He's just walking around set during the pilot.”

During the sit-down with Josh, Bell said he was worried about the fallout of the investigation on their show.

“Is this gonna hurt our show? When this drops, is Josh gonna look at me and be like, ‘Bro, you took our dream away,'” Bell recalled thinking at the time. “I was losing my hair. I had these giant scabs on my head. I had no idea why and there were like golf ball size scabs where I'm losing my hair. Then I got to go back and shoot the show.”

Josh explained that he had “a feeling” something happened when Brian was no longer on set. He didn't know the details of Brian's abuse — or that Bell was a victim — but he did recall one telling conversation with his costar.

“He was gone. I didn't know anything except I had a feeling something happened. And I remember we're in the car and I said, ‘Do you still talk to Brian?' You just looked at me like, ‘No, Brian's a really bad guy.,” Josh said. “And I remember thinking, ‘That is all that I needed to know. I didn't know anything more than that but I was like, ‘That's clear. I get it.'”

Quiet on Set revealed dozens of letters written in support of Brian after his arrest. Some of Bell and Josh's costars from Drake & Josh were included in the surprising list of actors advocating for Brian.

Bell said on Monday that he lost trust for those around him in the industry after finding out about the letters. Josh, for his part, revealed that he read at least one of the letters when he recently met with Bell for lunch before the podcast taping.

According to Josh, the pair “didn't get along at first” but suddenly became “inseparable.” Bell recalled them “hanging out” and “staying at each other's places” before the issues they were individually struggling with shifted their dynamic. (Josh has previously discussed his substance abuse issues, which started once he starred on Drake & Josh.)

Josh and Bell didn't appear to be in consistent contact before recently spending time together ahead of the podcast.

“It was a short lunch. I was driving home and I was like, ‘Oh, I forgot to tell him this. I wanted to tell him about this.' And then I was like, ‘Oh, I'll just text him. No, don't text him. That'll bother him. Wait until he texts you,'” Bell joked. “I was like, ‘Wait till he texts you. Don't look too excited.'”

In between reminiscing about their Nickelodeon days, Josh brought up Bell's past social media posts about Bieber that got him in trouble with the singer's fans. Bell, for his part, revealed he only met Bieber once but heard he was a big fan of Drake & Josh.

Christine Quinn is moving with a new man!

The 36-year-old former Selling Sunset star split from her husband Christian Dumontet last year following an alleged domestic incident that led to him being arrested and her getting a restraining order. He then officially filed for divorce in April 2024.

Fast forward to present day, Christine and their son moved to the Dallas, Texas area, and she was most recently spotted on vacation with a new beau. 

Keep reading to find out more...

Christine is reportedly now dating Texas Capital Bank energy sales specialist Thomas McGarrity, and the two have been seen on vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico this weekend. 

The two were seen sitting on lounge chairs in a cabana on Friday (March 21), sipping drinks, and even sharing a kiss. See photos on E! News and TMZ!

On her move to Texas, Christine previously told People it's nice to be close to family. 

""I am really, really grateful to be living here,"" she said. ""I have a sister who lives really close to me, and my son has a cousin. So it's really something that I needed as opposed to the chaos when I was in Los Angeles.”

She also notes that her son has been thriving since the move, and has become quite the talker after previously being nonverbal.

""It's just so crazy since I moved to Texas. I mean, he was literally a nonverbal child at three years old, which is pretty rare,” Christine said. “He went from that to being immediately enrolled in school, having other kids around him, being so talkative, being so extroverted.”

Warning: This post may contain spoilers from The White Lotus

Patrick Schwarzenegger and Sam Nivola are opening up about their characters' storyline in the latest episode of The White Lotus. 

In episode five, which aired on March 16th, it was revealed that the two brothers, Saxon and Lochlan, had kissed while partying with Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) and Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood) on Gary's (Jon Gries) super yacht.

This week's episode, ""Denials,"" more from that night was uncovered, and Patrick and Sam are dishing on their characters' reactions and more.

Keep reading to find out more...

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!

In the episode, it was revealed that while Lochlan and Chloe were having sex, Lochlan was also reaching over and jerking off his brother, who was lying in the bed next to them. 

""We all just trusted each other, and that dynamic worked well. In the scene, Patrick and I are brothers, with this girl who we just met like the day before. It was very weird kissing Patrick because he's a really good friend of mine,"" Sam told Variety. ""And, you know, I'm straight, he's straight. It's already weird. It would have been easier if that was the first time we were meeting. Weirdly, it was easier to do things with Charlotte because there were no stakes. It's just this person I've just met. But Patrick was already like a brother to me. It felt sort of f--ked up.""

When asked if Lochlan was sexually attracted to his brother, Sam notes he think ""it's something else.""

""I think it comes from a sense of insecurity. He really looks up to both of his siblings, not from the point of view of a physical attraction. It's more curiosity, and trying to figure out which kind of person he is going to become. He tries to connect with him in whatever way he can,"" Sam said. ""I think Lochlan is a people pleaser, who will try to get people to like him by any means necessary. Looking at Saxon while he's jerking off is not a sexual thing — it's more that he's studying him: 'Who is this guy? How can I get him to like me? How can I become more like him?' What he learns over the first few episodes is that Saxon is the sex guy. His primary motive in life is to make money and get laid. So, the thing on the boat is Lochlan's tragically misguided attempt at being like, 'So, you're the sex guy. Let's do something in that realm and try to connect in some way.' It's obviously a big swing and a miss.""

As for Lochlan's sexuality, Sam adds that ""Lochlan has such a one-track mind. He wants love and attention — it could be from a guy, it could be from a girl. I don't think he knows what he's attracted to yet. If he finds out he's attracted to men after this season, then it will probably become a problem, given his family being rich, conservative Southerners. But at this time, that's not what's going through his head.""

Patrick, on the other hand, says he gasped when he first read the scene. 

""The first time I read it and got to that scene, I thought ‘Oh boy, we've got a wild [ride]. This is classic Mike White, classic White Lotus,” he told The Wrap. “It was going to be this hilarious moment throughout the script that was a big shift and changing point for Saxon, and for Saxon and Lochlan's relationship … and the power shift between the two of them.”

""Mike wants it to be an open-ended conversation for the viewer to come up to their own ideas,” Patrick added about which of them initiated it. “Did Saxon want it? Did he not want it? Does he even remember it? Does he not? Was it the drugs? Was it not? Was is it these girls that pressured him into doing it? Was it not?”

Patrick also talks about how Saxon deals with the aftermath of remember what happened. 

“[He] can't believe what possibly happened, and just feels this inferior back-at-the-bottom-of-the-totem-pole part in his life,” he said. “I think that everything around him and himself feels like is shattering from who he thought he should be.”

Joe Gatto has been accused of inappropriate conduct for a second time. 

The 48-year-old comedian and former Impractical Jokers star just faced a first accusation of sexual assault on Thursday (March 20), to which he denied any assault.

Now, a former employee is also accusing the comedian, describing her experience as sexual harassment and that he exhibited unwanted behaviors. 

Keep reading to find out more…

This second woman, who was employed by him prior to his exit from Impractical Jokers in 2021, says she first met him when she was just 15 years old, and as soon as she turned 18, his behavior became very flirtatious.

Per People, prior to her starting the job, she was warned by a former employee that “she perceived him to sometimes be flirty and handsy,” and he “often tells inappropriate jokes, and advised her to shut it down immediately if he did anything creepy.” 

The woman said she learned quickly what the warning was for, as during her time working for him, he “occasionally inappropriately grabbed her and asked for back massages,” with him even inviting her to his room once, asking her to cuddle. He even allegedly made frequent inquiries about her sex life.

She claims he often bragged about being in an open relationship with then wife Bessy (they split in 2021), and he would DM her, responding to social media posts calling her “hot” and acting possessive, getting jealous when she posted photos with her boyfriend at the time. 

After rejecting his advances, the woman says he would be rude to her the next day, and she “felt as though she always had to work to keep him at ease, fearing she could lose her job.”

The former employee says there was a larger pattern of emotional manipulation that continued up until she left after two years.

She also alleges that during a work trip, he grabbed her thigh while in an elevator, leading to her moving to the other side of the elevator, and him telling her he knew it would make her uncomfortable. 

On another trip, she says he insisted employees come back to his room and drink, though, she notes he wouldn't drink, just encourage others to drink around him.

Following the first accusations from an account on TikTok, Joe spoke out, releasing a statement where he denied her claims.

“I have used poor judgment and as a result have violated the trust of the people I love most,” Joe shared in a statement via Variety.

“But anyone who knows me at all knows full well that I wouldn't assault anyone,” he continued. “Working on myself is an ongoing process, and I am now going to take some time away from the public eye to focus my energies where I need to.”","{'href': 'https://www.justjared.com', 'title': 'Just Jared'}"

Meghan Markle's life in Kensington Palace seemed doomed from the start.

The Duchess of Sussex was accused of having a ""messiah complex"" by former palace aides, who nicknamed her ""Duchess of Difficult"" before she made her royal exit.

The claim was made by royal author Tom Quinn, who has written a new book, ""Yes Ma'am: The Secret Life of Royal Servants."" Quinn spoke to hundreds of former and current palace staff members to learn what it's like to watch over the House of Windsor.

Meghan Markle Blamed By Prince Harry's Pals For Making Him ‘Too Woke' Before Royal Exit: Author

Fox News Digital reached out to Archewell, which handles the offices of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and Kensington Palace for the Prince and Princess of Wales for comment. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace previously told Fox News Digital, ""We don't comment on such books.""

""Several of the aides that I spoke to, as well as the more junior staff, said that Meghan had what they called a ‘messiah complex,'"" Quinn claimed to Fox News Digital.

Read On The Fox News App

""I think what they meant was that, as a working royal, she could save all the people whose lives were difficult. She could help with all sorts of problems, including poverty. She had this sense that came from a very good motivation that she could change the world for the better. But the aides saw her ideas of doing good as completely out of proportion to what she actually could do.""

""They felt she had these grand ideas, but there was no way a single person could do what she wanted to do,"" Quinn shared. ""And I think there was also a suspicion that Meghan was trying to be more like William and Harry's mother, Princess Diana, that she was trying to do the same thing. And I think there was irritation that her sense of importance would reflect badly on the royal family.""

One member of Meghan's former staff claimed that the Duchess of Sussex was ""focused on how she could become the best-known and most-loved member of the royal family.""

""She once said, ‘What Diana started I want to finish,' and we took that to mean she wanted to become a sort of globetrotting champion of the poor and the marginalized,"" the ex-aide claimed.

One of Queen Elizabeth II's former courtiers also claimed to Quinn that Buckingham Palace had become ""really worried"" that Meghan had made her own plans for her life as a working royal. They felt she ""wanted to do her own thing,"" but ""it was never going to be acceptable that Meghan should outshine Princess Anne, Prince Charles [as he was then known] and [the queen].""

""Quite rightly, [the queen] always had to be the center and focus of everything the royal family did,"" the aide claimed, as quoted in Quinn's book.

""I don't think Meghan understood why that had to make her do things she didn't want to do. She didn't understand that when you join the royal family, you don't do as you please, you do as you're told. In a sense, you become a servant of the family.""

The aide claimed that Meghan ""felt constrained"" and started to feel that she and Harry needed to ""break out"" where they could be working royals but ""do their own thing without consulting the big royal machine."" For Harry, the idea of freedom sounded enticing, the aide claimed.

Quinn learned that the palace staff begged Harry to intervene. Instead, they began to see his ""tendency to defend anything and everything Meghan says or does.""

Quinn said he could see how Meghan's ambitions would become a problem.

""If you're married to the spare as Meghan is, you have to… accept that you're taking a backseat position,"" Quinn told Fox News Digital. ""Meghan didn't do that. That led to the idea that she had a ‘messiah complex.' She might have exaggerated her ability to do good, but her desire to do it was very sincere.""

Meghan's hugging also became a problem. The over-familiarity was considered ""rude"" by staff, who claimed that Kate Middleton, Prince William and King Charles III would ""flinch"" when Meghan moved in for an embrace.

""Tension developed between William and Harry as a result of Meghan's warm, friendly, hug-everyone approach,"" Quinn wrote.

""It made William uncomfortable because she hugged him virtually every time they bumped into each other; the hugging and cheek kissing fueled gossip among the staff that Meghan was flirting with William, which she was obviously not, but the tense atmosphere caused by all the touchy-feeliness (and the resultant gossip) deepened the rift between the brothers.""

Quinn told Fox News Digital while all the staff he spoke to agreed that the rumors were untrue, Kensington Palace was also a ""hothouse where gossip and rumors develop.""

""These rumors could become a life of their own,"" he said. ""The senior royals have to stop them before they start. Meanwhile, Meghan was upset and felt that the royal family was… pushing her away. I think the fact that Meghan felt slightly rejected was one of the reasons why this whole project [being senior royals] didn't work.""

""She was very warm,"" said Quinn. ""Whenever she met other members of the family, she would hug them… the royals just don't do that… Meghan was astonished, for example, that Charles was so formal with his mother. It was as if she couldn't understand why the family was so cold. She came from a tradition where if you met someone close to you, you hugged them.""

""Yes, Meghan got very bad press in the U.K.,"" Quinn continued. ""She was nicknamed the Duchess of Difficult by people who worked for her when she was a member of the royal family, and also, by other members of the royal family.""

But it wasn't always this way. Quinn pointed out in his book that at first, William and Kate found Meghan ""delightful,"" as quoted by one staffer.

""I actually rather liked Meghan,"" one staffer told Quinn. ""She was very straightforward and matter-of-fact, but some people didn't like that because they felt she had got a bit above herself. Even the kitchen maids, I think, were a bit jealous, which made them very critical of Meghan.

""They liked Harry and felt very protective of him and then along comes this American woman who – they felt – made Harry into a less likable character. But as one of Harry's own friends from the military said, ‘Harry was a man waiting for a woman to mold him, and Meghan was that woman.'""

One former Kensington Palace staffer also claimed to Quinn, ""Through absolutely no fault of her own, Meghan wasn't always great with her staff – she just wasn't used to it as Harry was. So, one minute she would be really friendly, perhaps over-friendly, with the staff, hugging everyone and trying to make friends with them, and the next she would be irritated by the fact that they wouldn't respond instantly at all times of the day and night.

""It's true that her nickname for a while was the Duchess of Difficult, but she had other, friendlier nicknames, including Mystic Meg, which came about because she was so New Agey, so woke, about so many things. She could be difficult because she was finding life difficult…""

A former staff member added, ""Meghan quite rightly hated the fact that when she was in Nottingham Cottage, she had to agree well in advance what time she might leave for an appointment or an event, and she had to make sure she didn't leave at the same time as, or clash in any way with, a more senior royal leaving the palace.""

Quinn wrote that while Meghan had her supporters within the royal household, others struggled to work with her. One senior staff member reportedly remarked, ""Oh my God, here we go again – Meghan is Mrs. Simpson come back to haunt us!""

The queen's uncle, Edward VIII, famously gave up the throne in 1936 so he could marry Wallis Simpson, the divorced American socialite.

""In a way, you could argue that Meghan upsetting senior staff and other members of the royal family was actually a good thing,"" Quinn told Fox News Digital. ""It led to what Meghan and Harry saw as their freedom.""

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped back as senior royals in 2020. They cited lack of support from the palace as one of their reasons. That year, the couple moved to California, where they're raising their two young children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.
