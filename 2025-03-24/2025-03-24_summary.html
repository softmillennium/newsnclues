Military vessel HDMS Ejnar Mikkelsen of the Royal Danish Navy patrols near Nuuk, Greenland, Wednesday, March 5, 2025. Danish national police on Sunday sent extra personnel and sniffer dogs to Greenland as part of regular security measures taken during visits by dignitaries. Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright will also be travelling to Greenland, the White House said. The likely next Greenlandic leader, Jens-Frederik Nielsen of Demokraatit, sought to calm nerves and said he was working on building a new coalition government “with the clear goal of creating security for our country and our people.” Trump had mused during his first term about buying the world's largest island, even as Denmark insisted it wasn't for sale.</p>

While Hollywood saw powerful men fall swiftly and publicly, the French film industry was slower to respond. Prosecutors say Depardieu trapped the set dresser with his legs before groping her waist and breasts in front of witnesses. She says the actor also used obscene language and had to be pulled away by bodyguards. She said that four additional women who say they have been sexually assaulted by Depardieu will testify. Actors Vincent Perez and Fanny Ardant were among those who took seats on his side of the courtroom.</p>

After President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff raised hopes of “real progress” on a Black Sea ceasefire in Monday's peace talks between United States and Russian negotiators, the Kremlin played down hopes for rapid progress, saying that numerous questions remain to be resolved. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov raised Russia's complex demands around the 2022-2023 Black Sea grain initiative, a further sign that Moscow's tactic may be to carefully slow the peace negotiations without outright rejecting them, while maintaining its hard-line conditions for a full ceasefire. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin's success in deflecting Trump's demand for a full ceasefire was part of Russia's tactics to slow the peace talks. Russia has used this formulation as part of its drive to remove President Volodymyr Zelensky and his government, claiming he is illegitimate. Asked about the possibility of an agreement in Monday's talks, Karasin said: “Not all negotiations necessarily yield some major documents and agreements.</p>

Prof Greg Shaw, the trial lead and a consultant urologist at University College London hospitals NHS foundation trust, said: “This procedure gives surgeons feedback during the surgery to give them the certainty they need to spare as many nerves as possible and give men increased hope of recovering their sexual potency after their cancer is surgically removed.” Slices of the prostate are then frozen, stained and examined for cancer cells. The trial assessed 344 men with prostate cancer who had no history of erectile dysfunction. Dr Matthew Hobbs, the director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “Prostate cancer surgery is a life-saving option for lots of men, but it's a major procedure that can cause side-effects like erection problems. “This study is promising and provides evidence that innovative types of surgery can reduce erectile dysfunction in some men.</p>

A woman in Colorado is facing dozens of criminal charges after her 76-year-old mother with dementia was found mauled to death among more than two dozen dogs living at their home. Jessica Hoff, 47, was arrested on Friday in connection to the death of LaVonne Hoff, said a news release from the sheriff's office in Pueblo county, Colorado, that laid out a case containing elder and animal neglect allegations. An autopsy later revealed that LaVonne Hoff had died of injuries resulting from a dog attack, the sheriff's office said. Deputies worked with local animal control officers to seize the dogs and birds in question. Hoff remained in custody on Monday at the Pueblo county jail, online records show.</p>

Mr Nangaa also dismissed Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi's comments last week that his country is looking for a minerals partnership with the US that will bring peace and stability for both countries. Since launching a major escalation of their decade-long fighting with the Congolese forces in late January, the M23 rebels have captured the cities of Goma and Bukavu and several towns in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, forcing thousands of soldiers to either flee or surrender and prompting fears of regional warfare involving neighbours whose militaries are also on the ground. Efforts to achieve a ceasefire collapsed last week after the rebels pulled out from talks being facilitated by Angola, condemning European Union sanctions on its leaders. Despite calls for a ceasefire, M23 rebels have now seized the key town of Walikale which gives them control of a strategic road linking four provinces in eastern Congo — North Kivu, South Kivu, Tshopo and Maniema — effectively cutting off Congolese army positions. The group says it is defending ethnic Tutsis and Congolese of Rwandan origin from discrimination.</p>

Tesla's market share fell to 9.6% last month, the lowest it has registered in February for five years. Analysts and investors have been attempting to assess what impact Musk's political interventions are having on the carmaker, where he is chief executive, amid signs that his senior role in Trump's administration is leading to a consumer backlash by some Tesla owners or prospective buyers. The research company's figures for February show that Tesla's rivals powered ahead in Europe last month. Separate figures show that BYD's global sales topped $100bn (£83bn) last year, overtaking Tesla as the world's biggest electric car company by revenue. Polestar, which is primarily owned by Volvo's parent company, Geely, recorded an 84% increase to more than 2,000 vehicles.</p>

Donald Trump has taken aim at the actor and prominent Democrat activist George Clooney, dismissing his interview on US TV news programme 60 Minutes as a “total puff piece”. The Oscar-winning star was the subject of Sunday's show to promote his Broadway debut, in a stage version of the film Good Night, and Good Luck, in which he plays veteran journalist Edward R Murrow, who took part in a historic TV showdown with Senator Joseph McCarthy. The actor cited Trump's $16m recent defamation settlement with ABC News, as well as the $20bn “voter interference” suit Trump filed against CBS last October in which he claimed 60 Minutes had “deceptively edited” an interview with his rival, Kamala Harris, to present her in a more flattering light. “He fought hard for Sleepy Joe's election, and then, right after the Debate, dumped him like a dog. He then reiterated his earlier claims against the show, saying: “60 Minutes even fraudulently inserted Fake answers into her disastrous interview, aired just before Election Day, in one of the most embarrassing and dishonest events in broadcast history … And now George Clooney again?</p>

Mahmoud Al-Sayfi, 13, right with blue shirt, is comforted by relatives as he mourns both his parents killed during an Israeli army strike before their burial at the Baptist hospital in Gaza City, Monday, March 24, 2025. Qatar's Al Jazeera satellite news network says one of its Palestinian freelance reporters, Hossam Shabat, was killed by an Israeli airstrike on his car in northern Gaza. During his first term, Trump strongly backed Israel's claims to territories seized in war, at times upending decades of American foreign policy. Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani denied that Barhoum was receiving medical treatment in the hospital, saying he had been there for weeks meeting with other senior militants. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians.</p>

On the other, a gnawing collective feeling that Queensland might just stuff it all up. No one has bothered asking Brisbanites what sort of Olympic Games they want to host. Before the 2024 state election campaign, both major parties held focus groups that found broadly similar conclusions. Opponents of the Victoria Park stadium plan say they've briefed barristers and could launch a legal challenge. There is little doubt the IOC – when it devised its “new normal” process and awarded the games to a smaller city like Brisbane – had envisaged something other than bulldozing parkland and building concrete over First Nations cultural heritage sites.</p>

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday the Russian military has been fulfilling President Vladimir Putin's order to halt attacks on energy facilities for 30 days. Zelenskyy said Sunday evening that “since March 11, a proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table, and these attacks could have already stopped.

Irish government also hits back at accusations by US that country is operating a ‘tax scam' Official government data showed Ireland last year operated a trade deficit with the US of almost €93bn when goods and services were taken into account. Experts say tax changes in the US could have more damaging impact on the life sciences sector in Ireland than tariffs, with manufacturers unlikely to close plants that take years of planning to open. Trump has threatened a 200% tariff after the EU signalled it would add additional taxes to imports of US whiskey including Jack Daniel's and bourbon. Sinn Féin's Pearse Doherty told RTÉ that the party would be in favour of Brexit-style sectoral supports for businesses hit by a trade war.</p>

Trump posted on social media that those who were dismissed “do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture”. O'Brien was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of NBC's Late Night show in 1993 despite no significant on-camera experience.

Few comedians in India dare to make political jokes for risk of a backlash. Kamra's standup routine, performed in Mumbai's well-known Habitat comedy club on Friday night, included a parody song about Eknath Shinde, the second most powerful figure in the Maharashtra state government.

He also called for national unity, saying: “There's no left or right — what matters is the advancement of our nation.” After Han was suspended, his successor as acting president, Choi Sang-mok, appointed two new justices but left the ninth seat vacant. Yoon's office welcomed Monday's ruling, saying it shows again the opposition's repeated uses of impeachment motions were “reckless, malicious political offensive.” Massive rival rallies backing or denouncing Yoon have divided the streets of Seoul and other major cities in South Korea.</p>

Imamoglu was jailed on suspicion of running a criminal organization, accepting bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and bid-rigging — accusations he has denied. A request for him to be imprisoned on terror-related charges was rejected although he still faces prosecution. Alongside Imamoglu, 47 other people were also jailed pending trial, including a key aide and two district mayors from Istanbul.</p>

Local media are calling this week a “super week” of landmark rulings because the Supreme Court is due to decide Wednesday on an appeal by Lee Jae-myung, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party and front-runner to win a presidential election if Yoon is removed from office, against his conviction for an violating election law. But opposition parties, unhappy with Choi's actions on appointing more judges to the Constitutional Court, submitted a motion on Friday to oust him, too — the 30th Democratic Party-led impeachment motion since Yoon took office in 2022. “There's no guarantee that only this party will do it in the future, either.”</p>

The Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa TV has reported that Bahroum had been receiving medical treatment at the Nasser Medical Complex for injuries sustained in a separate Israeli airstrike last week. The Palestinian militant group has described Barhoum's death as evidence of Israel's “disregard for international norms and agreements,” given that hospitals are entitled to special protection during armed conflict under the Geneva conventions. “Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has said. Hamas has accused Israel of “unilaterally” ending the ceasefire, according to Reuters. The war between Israel and Hamas broke out after Palestinian militants carried out a surprise attack on Israeli cities on October 7, 2023, leaving around 1,200 people dead and taking around 250 hostages.</p>

Bird flu can cause severe illness, including pneumonia, and even death – with experts tracking changes in the H5N1 virus carefully amid fears it could trigger a human pandemic. While the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes there is no evidence H5N1 passes from human to human, the virus has been detected in a wide range animals other than birds including cats, foxes, otters, bush dogs and pigs, with experts saying a new variant is endemic in dairy cows in the US. The appearance of H5N1 in cows has been a shock for scientists, given it was previously thought such animals could not easily be infected with the virus. Dr Meera Chand, the emerging infection lead at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said: “Globally, we continue to see that mammals can be infected with avian influenza A(H5N1).</p>

Ms Vance's visit comes at a time when President Donald Trump has suggested the US should take control of Greenland. On her visit, Ms Vance will attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race, featuring about 37 mushers and 444 dogs. Media outlets in Greenland and Denmark reported that Ms Vance would be accompanied by Mr Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz. Mr Trump had mused during his first term about buying the world's largest island, even as Denmark, a Nato ally, insisted it was not for sale. After Taiwan detained a Chinese-crewed vessel for severing an undersea telecommunications cable off the island in late February 2025, social media users misleadingly claimed President Lai Ching-te ordered the military to respond by firing into an area where other Chinese-owned ships have lingered.</p>

The shoes and backpacks, arranged in neat rows, make it look almost like a school cloakroom. But the ranch where they were found is an alleged training camp and killing site for Mexico's Jalisco cartel. “These places exist all over the country,” said María Guadalupe Aguilar, founder of Familias Unidas por Nuestros Desaparecidos, who has been searching for her son José Luis Arana since 17 January 2011. Gertz said his office is exploring whether failures in the initial investigation were due to incompetence or collusion with organised crime.

Trump used their price as a campaign issue but has been unable to stop costs rising. Everybody knows how much eggs cost,” said Clodagh Harrington, a lecturer in American politics at University College Cork. The ongoing egg price outrage could be seen as a political problem of Republicans' own making. Brooke Rollins, the secretary of agriculture, was dispatched to Fox News in early March to defend the price surge, and suggested that people combat prices by buying their own chickens and having them roam around their property. America's egg farmers are working hard to protect their farms and birds so they can continue supplying the nutritious eggs Americans love,” she said.</p>

Militarily, Turkey has NATO's second largest army in addition to a well-developed defense industry capable of supplying high-tech weaponry such as aerial drones. “Erdogan was hopeful that he could slow down, if not completely hinder, Imamoglu's candidacy prospects,” Esen said.

Cherry blossoms, or “sakura”, are Japan's favourite flower and usually reach their peak in late March to early April, just as the country celebrates the start of a new school and business year. Many Japanese people enjoy walking or picnicking under the trees. They are expected to reach their peak in about 10 days. Cherry trees are sensitive to temperature changes and the timing of their blooming can provide valuable data for climate change studies. In recent years, Japan's cherry blossom season has tended to come earlier than the average, prompting concerns of a possible impact of climate change.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he would also like railways and ports to be protected. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Mr Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said he expected “some real progress” at the talks in Saudi Arabia, “particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries, and from that you'll naturally gravitate into a full-on shooting ceasefire”. As for Sunday talks in Riyadh between Ukrainian and US representatives, Mr Zelensky said they had been conducted on a more “technical level” compared to similar meetings last week, this time involving representatives from Ukraine's military, energy ministry and diplomatic corps.</p>

While it doesn't explicitly reference Trump's executive order, the advisory notes “there are two gender designations to choose from: male or female” when applying for a visa or Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) approval. The German Federal Foreign Office, in its updated travel guidance, also warned that US visa and ESTA applications require selecting either “male” or “female.” Berlin also advised whose gender is marked X or whose gender differs from their sex assigned at birth to consult the American authorities about entry requirements before traveling. US passport holders were previously able to self-select their sex, with one option being the letter X denoting that a person's gender is unspecified. Since assuming office Trump has rolled back trans rights protections and ended federal support for medical operations related to sex change procedures for minors to protect them from “chemical and surgical mutilations.” There are also plans to block transgender athletes from competing in US-hosted events, including the 2028 Olympics and World Cup.</p>

Faced with this claim, Poroshenko agreed, but said it was Zelenskyy's fault for launching sanctions against him: “Ukraine is weak without unity and definitely Putin will use this opportunity to undermine the internal stability in Ukraine,” he said. A billionaire confectionery magnate who went into politics, Poroshenko was elected president after the Maidan revolution in 2014. Asked about which members of the Trump team he has met, Poroshenko said: “Many members, some publicly.” He declined to go into much detail, but recalled a meeting with Michael Waltz, Trump's national security adviser, before Waltz was appointed to the role. Poroshenko said he was “crystal clear” in his contacts with the Trump team that there could be no elections during wartime.</p>

The San Francisco-based company said its chief executive and co-founder Anne Wojcicki was stepping down. She has been pushing for a buyout since April last year but was rebuffed by 23andMe's board. Revenues have fallen as many of its 15 million customers scramble to delete their DNA data from the company's archives. Wojcicki offered to pay $0.41 (£0.32) a share earlier this month, down by 84% from an offer in February. Her private equity partner walked away after the board's rejection of that bid.</p>

On the other hand, copper has been in supply constraints due to a lack of mineral investment and reduced refinery capabilities.</p>

Germany has temporarily closed its embassy in South Sudan's capital, Juba, saying Africa's newest country is on the verge of civil war amid reports of heightened tensions between President Salva Kiir Mayardit and his first deputy, Riek Machar. The East African country gained independence from Sudan in 2011 but has remained volatile since the end of a five-year civil war that erupted in 2013 over a feud between President Kiir and his current first vice president, Machar. Last week, Kiir sacked the governor of Upper Nile state, where clashes have erupted between South Sudan People's Defense Forces (SSPDF) and the White Army militia, which is mostly made up of Nuer people, Machar's ethnic group. Two ministers and several senior military officials allied with Machar have also been arrested. Earlier this month, several soldiers of the SSPDF, including an army general, were killed when a UN helicopter came under attack while attempting to evacuate them from the troubled Upper Nile state.</p>

Led by Nottingham Forest striker Wood and with a generationally-talented squad, New Zealand thumped Fiji 7-0 in their semi-final on Friday and were expected to be far too strong for New Caledonia, the world No 152. But early on, the All Whites played without intensity or fluency, unable to fashion strong chances. Despite his Premier League pedigree, Wood never looked on song, even mis-volleying one effort backwards. Adding to their disadvantage, the New Caledonia Super Ligue has been paused since last year owing to major civil unrest which claimed more than a dozen lives and devastated the capital, Noumea. New Zealand ran out the match without their captain and vice-captain, with Wood off and Liberato Cacace needing a late substitution, though both were fit enough to revel after the final whistle.</p>

Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East and a key figure in the settlement process, suggested that the talks would lead to “some real progress, particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries. And from that you'll naturally gravitate to a full-on shooting ceasefire.” The talks also follow US-Ukraine negotiations in Saudi Arabia.</p>

The President also hinted there may be “flexibility” in his plan to impose blanket tariffs on most US trading partners. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that steel and aluminium tariffs may not necessarily add to the country-by-country rates. They will incentivize investment into America," Stephen Miran, Trump's Council of Economic Advisers chairman, said in an interview, declining to detail the steps. The White House has also argued that trillions of dollars in pledged announcements by foreign countries and companies provide evidence Trump's plans are working. "I do think that it's perfectly reasonable to expect that we could raise trillions of dollars from tariffs over a 10-year budget window and like I said before, using those revenues to finance lower rates on American workers, on American businesses," he said.</p>

After his reinstatement, Han called for national unity and emphasized the need to focus on addressing external challenges stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies. Han's case is unlikely to serve as a preview of how the court will rule on Yoon. But the Constitutional Court likely won't take a deep dive into Yoon's criminal allegations, as it's only required to rule whether or not he can remain in office. While Yoon called 11 Cabinet members to his office shortly before declaring martial law on late-night television, Han has said the gathering did not qualify as a formal Cabinet meeting and that Yoon unilaterally informed them of his decision rather than inviting deliberation. Under South Korea's constitution, such powers can only be exercised during wartime or comparable national emergencies.</p>

Scientists have discovered a "vast underground city" running beneath the famed Egyptian pyramids in Giza. It has also discovered various other unidentified structures 4,000 feet down, GB News reported. But Zahi Hawass, Egypt's former minister of antiquities and a leading expert on the pyramids, flatly denied these discoveries. The techniques used were "neither scientifically approved nor validated", Mr Hawass said, calling all claims "completely wrong" and "fake news." Ms Conyers emphasised the entrances of caves or caverns had "ceremonial meaning" to "Mayans and other people in ancient Mesoamerica" and often built pyramids on top of the entrances.</p>

Just days after the US accused China of testing 'dogfighting' satellites in low Earth orbit, Beijing has clapped back with a sharp rebuttal. Against this backdrop, various branches of the US military were desperate for budget increases and sought to secure more funding by hyping up so-called "threats" from China, Russia, and others". The USSF stated that Mr Guetlein was referring to three Chinese Shiyan-24C experimental satellites and two Shijian-6 05A/B experimental space objects that had been seen carrying out complex manoeuvres in low Earth orbit. "There used to be a capability gap between us and our near peers, mainly driven by the technological advancement of the United States that capability gap has significantly narrowed." Ever since the three Shiyan satellites were launched in 2022, western military officials and experts have claimed that they are being deployed to test military capabilities, such as grappling with satellites of rival nations in space.</p>

There were no warning signs when teenager Austin Blight went into cardiac arrest. He survived because staff performed CPR and used an automated external defibrillator to shock his heart before paramedics arrived. He lives in Victoria, where residents are more likely to survive a heart episode than any other Australian state and almost any other place in the world. This is all thanks to early intervention, with bystander CPR administered in 79% of witnessed cases and 141 cases receiving a shock from a public automated external defibrillator (AED) – the highest number on record. Ambulance Victoria's free GoodSAM app, which alerts people to someone in cardiac arrest nearby, is also making a difference with 17,327 registered responders and 793 cases attended by volunteers in the last year.</p>

Han took over as acting president after the country's leader, Yoon Suk Yeol, was himself impeached over his short-lived declaration of martial law late last year. “I believe that all citizens are clearly speaking out against the highly polarised political sphere,” he said. Han, 75, had served in leadership positions for more than three decades under five presidents, both conservative and liberal. South Korea's presidential office welcomed Han's reinstatement and said the ruling “reaffirms that excessive impeachments by the national assembly are reckless and malicious political offensives”. The unexpected imposition of martial law on 3 December by Yoon and the ensuing political upheaval sent shock waves through Asia's fourth-largest economy, and drew concerns from allies such as the US, who had seen Yoon as a key partner in efforts to counter China and North Korea.</p>

Coral reef experts use a metric known as degree heating weeks (DHW) to show how much heat corals have accumulated. Howells said there was less coral mortality this year, “but that's because a lot of the sensitive corals died last summer”. Gamblin said the widespread damage from underwater heatwaves and cyclones to both reefs was “what our world-renowned scientists have been warning us about for decades”.</p>

Luther Madison II, 39, is accused of shooting his son's girlfriend's father with a gun allegedly handed to him by his wife, Angelica Madison, 39, during a dispute in Hockley on March 18. According to Harris County Constable Mark Herman, the altercation began when the parents met to discuss keeping their children apart, as the victim's family believed their daughter was "too young to be dating." He was airlifted to the hospital, but his current condition remains unknown. The couple has since bonded out of jail and is scheduled to appear in court on May 20. It is unclear whether they have entered a plea.</p>

KYIV — Nearly 150 Russian drones descended on Ukraine early Sunday, rattling Kyiv awake just after midnight to the boom of explosions, which killed three people and injured 10 — deepening tensions ahead of ceasefire talks continuing this week in Saudi Arabia. While Ukraine has supported a comprehensive ceasefire without preconditions, as proposed by the United States, Russian President Vladimir Putin last week agreed only to a narrow proposal barring strikes on energy infrastructure. After Russian drones struck the Ukrainian port city of Odessa on Friday, and then its Zaporizhzhia region — killing three people in a family of four, leaving the oldest daughter the only survivor — Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Kyiv of having a “lack of desire to achieve peace.” The Kremlin blamed Ukraine for the explosion of an oil depot in Russia's Kuban region and an attack on a gas metering station in Sudzha, a town in western Russia seized last year by Ukraine and recently retaken by Russia. She acknowledged the morning's grief — but it was also just another day of war. “What will happen if I sit down now and cry?” she said, pausing to pick up her ringing cellphone, another neighbor calling with news.</p>

South Korea's Constitutional Court struck down the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo on Monday, reinstating him as acting president -- a role he was given after the president was suspended for declaring martial law last year. Mr Han was impeached by lawmakers in December, just weeks after he took over as acting leader from President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was himself impeached over his short-lived suspension of civilian legal process. Mr Han's impeachment was dismissed in a 7-1 vote by the court's eight justices. Parliament impeached him over his alleged role in martial law, as well as his refusal to appoint more justices and back special counsel bills targetting Yoon and First Lady Kim Keon Hee. Mr Han, 75, had served in leadership positions for more than three decades under five presidents, both conservative and liberal.</p>

According to Mr Vembu, while AI effectively removes accidental complexity, human expertise remains essential for tackling core challenges. "In view of the various challenges and opportunities facing us, including recent major developments in AI, it has been decided that it is best that I should focus full time on R&D initiatives, along with pursuing my personal rural development mission," he said at the time.

Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said he expected “some real progress” at the talks in Saudi Arabia, “particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries, and from that you'll naturally gravitate into a full-on shooting ceasefire.” Asked about concerns that Russian President Vladimir Putin may be looking beyond Ukraine and could press further into Europe, even if Russia is awarded territory within Ukraine now, Witkoff said he has been asked his opinion on what Putin's motives are on a large scale. “There is no point in signing anything (with Russians), because it will not be worth the cost of paper where you put this signature. Vadym Filashkin said, including three who died in a strike on the frontline town of Dobropillya. “This week alone, more than 1,580 guided aerial bombs, almost 1,100 strike drones and 15 missiles of various types were used against our people,” he said.</p>

Women's rights activists demonstrate outside the Paris Palace of Justice as French actor Gérard Depardieu, who is facing trial for the alleged sexual assaults of two women on a film set in 2021, won't appear before a criminal court, Monday, Oct. 28, 2024, in Paris. I'll stick it in your (nether regions).” She said he then grabbed her forcefully and had to be pulled away by bodyguards. While Hollywood saw powerful men fall swiftly and publicly, the French film industry was slower to respond. Yet the industry offered little institutional pushback, highlighting a deep-rooted reluctance to confront abuse when it involves revered cultural figures. But his off-screen controversies have long made headlines, from drunk driving to urinating in the aisle of a plane.</p>

Parisians cast their ballots Sunday over an ambitious proposal floated by the mayor that would block 500 streets to road traffic and replace miles of asphalt with plants and trees, in a poll that will serve as a key test of people's willingness to support climate policies even if they might have a disruptive impact on daily life. It's the third vote on the city's transportation policies organized by Hidalgo, after Parisians voted in 2023 to ban e-scooters for hire and last year to impose a new fee on SUVs and other particularly polluting vehicles. Critics also argue that the vote encourages a focus on symbolic numbers over meaningful progress toward green goals: For example, they say freshly planted trees do not provide the same environmental benefits as older trees, whose foliage has fully developed, and say there should be more of a focus on protecting established trees. City Hall did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post on Sunday. Hidalgo's moves have earned her acclaim overseas, but they have been more controversial at home, with critics accusing her of deepening disparities between Parisians living inside the city within easy access of public transportation and those living in suburbs or further out who must drive in and out of the city for work.</p>

Washington, D.C.'s iconic cherry blossoms are getting closer to the 2025 peak bloom. The timing of peak bloom varies each year, largely due to temperatures, with warmer temperatures leading to earlier peak blooms. "A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all."

As Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian recently reported, not only has the changeover to the new Model Y SUV been seen as a drag on sales, but Musk's closeness to President Trump and embrace of right-wing politics may be also impacting the brand.

"I think Intel has a much better shot of remaining viable in this industry [under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan]," Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen below). Tan frequently pushed for a better artificial intelligence strategy to take on Nvidia (NVDA) and faster decision making at the notoriously bureaucratic Intel. Gelsinger led aggressive efforts to turn around the troubled US chipmaker for more than three years. He was fired in early December amid missed targets and a cash drain on the foundry business. So I think what we were trying to say is that under his leadership, Intel has a better chance of adding [value] ... and getting recognized for its IP value because [Tan] comes from that background."</p>

Monday's broad market rally followed reports late Sunday that Trump would narrow the number of US trading partners subject to reciprocal tariffs on April 2. Speaking last week at its GTC Conference, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the introduction of lower-cost models — like those most notably put forth by China's DeepSeek — shows the computing needs for AI are actually higher than previously thought. Nvidia's chips are also subject to an export ban from the US in China. Also in tech news, a South Korean AI chip startup FuriosaAI reportedly rejected an $800 million offer from Meta. This takes a potential headache away from Meta shareholders, who might have to price in regulatory overhangs and integration costs, and shows AI startups have plenty of confidence to explore the market independently.</p>

A rally in US stocks Monday morning amid reports that President Trump's tariffs will be less widespread than feared underscored how more clarity on the administration's new policies remains the key to a market bounce-back. Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee wrote in a note to clients on Sunday night that markets appeared to be "setting up for a potential face-ripper rally this week as recent developments have eased several of the major fears that have weighed on equities since December." While Monday's market action shows markets have been hoping Trump's tariffs won't be as widespread as once thought, some equity strategists believe investors likely need official announcements from the administration before the tariff uncertainty overhang on stocks is fully removed. "This relief that we're seeing is more a result of the fact that there was no sort of whiplash from the White House last week, and it seems like we've had more marginally positive news with respect to what tariffs might potentially look like on April 2nd," Raymond James chief market strategist Matt Orton told Yahoo Finance Monday morning.

Bismuth provides better carrier mobility —the speed at which electrons can move through it when an electrical field is applied. Should this transistor be fitted into a chip that does prove faster than US-made chips by Intel and other companies, it could also allow China to sidestep current restrictions on buying advanced chips and tap into US chip-making by shifting to a wholly different manufacturing process.

Gasoline powers many of the cars we drive; coal and natural gas are central to global energy. It would be hard for them to simply bypass the production of fossil fuels, he noted. Put another way, plate tectonics can help pave the way for life and create conditions to help it become fossil fuels; it can also create ideal conditions for life that may become intelligent enough to harness those fuels. What they have discovered, however, is evidence of fossil fuels' chemical building blocks: hydrogen and carbon.

Colorado law does not allow retail sales of psilocybin, unlike cannabis, which can be sold both recreationally and medically in the state.

A growing body of evidence indicates that each LE8 component can profoundly influence the risk factors associated with cancer development and progression. The strongest cancer-preventive effects were seen in people who had both high LE8 scores and elevated levels of inflammation, suggesting lifestyle choices may help offset biological risk. The analysis controlling for potential confounding factors, including age, sex, and lifestyle behaviors, revealed that participants with higher LE8 scores had significantly lower overall cancer risks. Although LE8 includes diet, the study lacked detailed nutrition data, so researchers used salt and tea consumption as rough indicators of dietary habits. However, the study has limitations: the cohort was geographically limited to a single industrial community in China, which may affect generalizability; dietary data were not comprehensively assessed (e.g., specific nutrient intake); lifestyle metrics relied on self-reports, which are subject to recall bias; and critical cancer-specific factors (e.g., reproductive history for breast cancer) were not analyzed.</p>

The 51-year-old Medved is a Minneapolis native and Golden Gophers alumnus (1997). Colorado State had a terrific run of player development under Medved: David Roddy, Isaiah Stevens and now Nique Clifford all blossomed into NBA-level players.

14 pick in last year's draft, and while his profile isn't quite as Fantasy friendly as Campbell's – he doesn't run much and has had questions about how likely he is to maximize his raw power – but the way Smith won over a smart organization like the Astros has to count for something. McClanahan pitched seven innings this spring, striking out eight, walking two, and allowing no runs in his return from a second Tommy John surgery. Emilio Pagan, Taylor Rogers, and Scott Barlow all have some closer experience, though none are really light's out options; Graham Ashcraft has the stuff to be one, but it'll have to play up a lot better than it did in the rotation, where he was consistently a below-average strikeout pitcher. Holliday and Scott both flopped in their first tastes of the majors last season, but they're getting a second chance here. I have no idea how sustainable his success this spring will prove, but 23 strikeouts and a 0.93 ERA over 19.1 innings is definitely worth taking notice of.</p>

Pochettino and his players were in agreement that things need to change, arguing that this week's results force a period of reflection before they reconvene in June for a pair of friendlies and the Gold Cup, which marks their final competitive games before next year's World Cup. Tyler Adams, meanwhile, singled out inconsistent individual outings as something that prevents the USMNT from stringing together impressive collective performances. I think when you have good individual performances in international football, usually it breeds something," Adams said. The focal point of that growth plan is a U.S. team that puts together a statement-making performance, and while Pochettino's first months on the job had gone well, this month's games have forced many to reconsider what this group's true ceiling is. They continue to trust the process, however new it may be, because there's a huge task at hand.</p>

Campbell has greatly boosted his stock since being drafted in the fourth round during summer 2023. One might recall that Campbell's name was bandied about early this spring once the Red Sox were known to have signed Alex Bregman. When word broke that the Red Sox wanted to play Bregman at third base, that would leave second open for Campbell, pushing incumbent third baseman Rafael Devers to designated hitter. As such, it appears the coast is clear for Bregman to play third with Devers at DH and Campbell to try and make his mark as the everyday second baseman.
