Russian and US officials are holding talks in the Saudi city of Riyadh today as efforts to end the Ukraine war continue. Follow the latest here - and submit a question for defence analyst Michael Clarke below. Listen to The World podcast as you scroll.

Monday 24 March 2025 16:00, UK

Live reporting by Mark WyattandOllie Cooper

Security and defence analyst Michael Clarke returns for his weekly Q&A on the Ukraine war tomorrow afternoon - covering anything from the battlefield to the negotiating table.

He'll tackle as many of your questions as he can - submit yours in the box above to join in.

Russia must stop its attacks instead of "making hollow statements about peace", Ukraine's foreign minister has said this afternoon after the Kremlin's strikes on Sumy. 

In a statement on X, Andrii Sybiha said dozens had been injured after Russian bombing in the northern region.

He said any diplomacy with Moscow "must be backed up by firepower, sanctions and pressure".

You can read his statement here...

Sumy is about 18.6 miles from the Russian border and is subject to regular drone and missile strikes by Russia.

Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine with the intent, among other things, of stealing its children, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reports.

In its latest war update, the US-based thinktank states that when Russian troops rolled across the border into Ukraine, "the groundwork for the massive deportation of Ukraine's children was already in place".

Ukrainian human rights activists uncovered Kremlin documents dated February 2022, which laid out plans to remove Ukrainian children from orphanages in the occupied Luhansk and Donetsk regions and bring them to Russia, the thinktank says.

"In the subsequent three years, Russia has embarked on a Kremlin-directed, deeply institutionalised project to abduct Ukrainian children and forcibly turn them into the next generation of Russians," the ISW reports.

The thinktank says Ukraine has been able to verify Russia's deportation of 19,456 children to date.

Meanwhile, Yale's Humanitarian Research Lab has placed the number of deported children closer to 35,000 as of 19 March.

The ISW adds: "The true number of deported children is near-impossible to verify, but the implication remains the same - Russia has stolen tens, potentially hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian children with the explicit intent of eradicating their Ukrainian identities and turning them into Russians."

We brought you reports earlier on a Russian missile strike in the northern Ukrainian Sumy region (see post at 2.21pm).

Regional head Volodymyr Artiukh said 28 people had been injured after the strike hit residential buildings and a school.

He said children were being evacuated at the time, and all were safe.

Now images are emerging of rescuers at the scene working to extinguish the fires.

The attack came ahead of ceasefire negotiations in Saudi Arabia in which Ukraine and Russia are expected to hold indirect US-mediated talks. 

US and Ukrainian officials are due to hold another round of talks after discussions between Moscow and Washington end today in Riyadh, a senior Ukrainian government source has told Reuters.

A delegation from Kyiv already met with US officials yesterday to discuss the details of a potential ceasefire.

Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's defence minister, said those talks were "constructive and meaningful".

The relationship between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been complex over the years.

Relations between the two presidents extend as far back as 2019, the year the Ukrainian leader took office.

It has since weathered the start of the war in Ukraine, Trump's re-election and a recent heated exchange in the Oval Office, in which Zelenskyy was accused of being "disrespectful" to his country's most powerful ally.

Here we look back at the key moments that have helped shape the pair's relationship and how it has changed over the years.

Vladimir Putin has spoken with his United Arab Emirates (UAE) counterpart Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan today, the Kremlin says.

The Russian president thanked Sheikh Khalifa for mediation in prisoner exchanges with Ukraine. The UAE says around 3,000 prisoners of war have been swapped by Ukraine and Russia with its mediation.

The pair also discussed the ongoing Russian-US peace talks on Ukraine.

"Mohammed Al Nahyan expressed support for the efforts undertaken by Russia and the United States and, in particular, welcomed the consultations of expert groups of the two countries taking place today in Riyadh," a Kremlin handout says.

A Russian missile strike has injured 28 people in the northern Ukrainian Sumy region, authorities said.

Regional head Volodymyr Artiukh said the strike hit residential buildings and a school, adding that children were being evacuated at the time, and all were safe.

Acting mayor Artem Kobzar said four children were among those injured following the strike but did not specify whether the four were in the school when the attack occurred.

By Ivor Bennett, Moscow correspondent

Kyiv might be furious at Steve Witkoff's comments over the weekend, but in Moscow, they're lapping them up.

The US envoy's interviews with Fox News and Tucker Carlson have made front page news, prompting talk of "mutual attraction" between the White House and the Kremlin.

That's because Witkoff repeated many of the lines we normally hear coming from Moscow: that Vladimir Putin "wants peace"; that European fears of further Russian invasions are "preposterous"; that the "root cause" of the war is not Russian aggression, but issues of Ukrainian nationhood.

Moscow can barely believe its luck. American and Russian officials are now speaking "the same language", according to daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta, which says Witkoff's comments show that Russia's interests are "justified" and will be taken into account by the US. 

Another newspaper, Kommersant, talks excitedly of Witkoff's "enthusiastic assessments" of President Putin.

But it's Witkoff's remarks about Russia's territorial claims that are receiving the most attention. 

The former property mogul said that most people in the Russian-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine wanted to live under Russian rule, citing Moscow-organised referenda that were condemned as shams by the UN. 

The comments were pounced on by Margarita Simonyan, the head of state broadcaster RT, who described them as the "main message" of Trump's Ukraine policy. Writing on Telegram, she suggested the ground was being prepared for recognition of Russia's territorial claims.

It would seem that Steve Witkoff's dismissal of Keir Starmer's "coalition of the willing" proposal wasn't up for discussion during the prime minister's call with Donald Trump last night.

His envoy Witkoff, who is leading US efforts to secure peace in Ukraine, labelled the UK's plans for a peacekeeping mission in the war-torn country as a "combination of a posture and a pose".

He also accused Starmer of adopting the "simplistic" notion that leaders "have all got to be like Winston Churchill".

Asked if those comments came up during a Trump-Starmer call last night, a No 10 spokesperson said the focus of the conversation "was on the economic deal".

"We are engaging with the US at all levels on Ukraine," the spokesperson added.

Ukraine has lost most of its foothold in the Kursk region of Russia - something we've covered here in detail, and that Vladimir Putin has been happy to shout about of late.

But despite fears Russia would carry on into Ukraine from Kursk, Kyiv's forces are now on the attack in another region of Russia.

Could Ukraine be after another bargaining chip in the negotiations seeking to end the war?

Here, junior OSINT producer Freya Gibson explains the emerging evidence of the new attacks.

The Ukrainian military has pushed into Belgorod (which borders Russia's Kursk region) in an attempt to capture Russian territory there.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy characterised the operation as a defensive measure to pre-empt a potential Russian offensive in Ukraine's Sumy Oblast. 

Expensive helicopters damaged

This morning, the Special Operation Forces of Ukraine posted a video that it says showed four Russian helicopters (two Kamov Ka-52 and two Mil Mi-8 helicopters) destroyed by missile strikes.  

Sky News has geolocated the footage.  

The Ka-52, also known as 'Alligator', is an attack helicopter capable of hitting targets 10km away - beyond the range of Ukraine's portable air defence systems. 

The Mi-8 can hold anti-tank missiles, rocket pods and drop bombs. 

Online reports say that the Ka-52 helicopter costs up to $16m (£12.3m), with the Mi-8 costing in the region of $10m-$15m (£7.7m-£11.5m).

Transport routes cut

As well as military damage, videos online show Ukrainian attempts to cut transport routes in Grafovka, a village in the Belgorod region. 

The images below are taken from a video showing a destroyed bridge which is just under 5km away from Demidovka, a town situated near the Sumy-Belgorod border.  

What could Ukraine's plan be?

Russian military bloggers claim Ukraine has attempted to capture Demidovka over the last few days. 

Experts suggest that Ukraine is trying to create a buffer zone near the border, indicating the intention of a long-term invasion in Belgorod. 

The image below is taken from a video shared on Telegram showing troops in Demidovka posted online today. It's not yet confirmed if they are Ukrainian or Russian.

Greenland's people are bracing for another visit from U.S. President Donald Trump's inner circle, with second lady Usha Vance set to travel to the autonomous Danish territory this week as her husband ratchets up talk about U.S. security and “territorial” interests in the vast Arctic island coveted by the administration.

Greenland's prime minister warned Sunday of “American aggression” and lamented a “mess” caused by the upcoming visit from Vance, who will be accompanied by Trump's national security adviser and energy secretary. The same day, Vice President JD Vance — her husband — blasted Denmark for “not doing its job” and “not being a good ally.” 

“So you have to ask yourself: How are we going to solve that problem, solve our own national security?” JD Vance said on Fox News. “If that means that we need to take more territorial interest in Greenland, that is what President Trump is going to do, because he doesn't care about what the Europeans scream at us.”

Denmark is a NATO ally of the United States, and northwestern Greenland already houses the U.S. Pituffik military base that falls under the Pentagon's Space Force.




Danish national police on Sunday sent extra personnel and sniffer dogs to Greenland as part of regular security measures taken during visits by dignitaries. A police spokesperson declined to give details, but news reports said dozens were flown in. 

Before the president began his second term in January, a visit by Trump's eldest son heightened concerns in Greenland about possible U.S. ambitions. Donald Trump Jr. told its residents that “we're going to treat you well” — weeks before March 11 elections that had centered on possible independence from Denmark. 

Greenlandic news outlet Sermitsiaq posted images of two U.S. Hercules workhorse military aircraft on the tarmac Sunday in Nuuk, the capital, adding that the planes later departed. News reports said four bulletproof cars had also been flown in.

On her visit, Vance will attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race which features about 37 mushers and 444 dogs, her office said. 

Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright will also be travelling to Greenland, the White House said.

“The U.S. has a vested security interest in the Arctic region and it should not be a surprise the National Security Advisor and Secretary of Energy are visiting a U.S. Space Base to get first-hand briefings from our service members on the ground,” said Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council.

Greenland is also in the process of political transition. The pro-business Demokraatit party, which favors a slow path to independence, won a surprise victory in the recent elections, outpacing the two left-leaning parties that formed the last government. 

Greenlandic Prime Minister Múte Bourup Egede, who remains in the post until a new government is formed, acknowledged Sunday on Facebook that there is worry on the island.

The visit of “the wife of the United States vice president and the United States president's highest security adviser cannot be seen only as a private visit,” he said. “We can already see now, how big a mess it's caused.”

Egede said there would be no official meetings with the U.S. visitors because a new government has yet to be formed. 

In an interview in Sermitsiaq, he was quoted as saying that if allied countries “do not speak out loudly about how the USA is treating Greenland, the situation will escalate day by day, and the American aggression will increase.” 

He called on Greenland's allies to show support, adding that “the only purpose” of a trip by Waltz is “a demonstration of power to us, and the signal is not to be misunderstood.”

“We have been treated unacceptably,” he wrote on his Facebook account.

The likely next Greenlandic leader, Jens-Frederik Nielsen of Demokraatit, sought to calm nerves and said he was working on building a new coalition government “with the clear goal of creating security for our country and our people.”

“When foreign dignitaries travel to our country on what are called private visits, it rightly causes concern,” he wrote on Facebook. “There is no reason to panic. But there is good reason to stand together and to demand respect. I do. And I will continue to do so.”

Trump had mused during his first term about buying the world's largest island, even as Denmark insisted it wasn't for sale. The people of Greenland have also firmly rejected Trump's plans. 

Since returning to the White House, Trump has repeatedly said that the U.S. will come to control Greenland while insisting he supports the idea for strategic national security reasons — not with an eye toward American expansionism.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, in a statement Sunday reported by Danish broadcaster DR, insisted “the visit from the United States cannot be viewed independently of the public statements that have been made.”

“We want to cooperate with the Americans. But it must be a cooperation based on the fundamental values of sovereignty and respect between countries and peoples,” she was quoted as saying. 

In Brussels, a spokesperson for the European Commission said Denmark, a member of the European Union, had the bloc's full support. 

“We will continue to uphold the principles of national sovereignty, the territorial integrity of our borders, and the UN charter. These are universal principles that we stand by, and we will not stop defending them, all the more so if the territorial integrity of our member States of the European Union is questioned,” Anitta Hipper said. 

Greenland straddles strategic air and sea routes in the North Atlantic and is home to the Pituffik Space Base, which supports missile warning and space surveillance operations. 

Greenland, whose population of 56,000 people are mostly from Indigenous Inuit backgrounds, also has large deposits of the rare-earth minerals needed to make everything from mobile phones to renewable energy technology.

Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff raised hopes of “real progress” on a Black Sea ceasefire in Monday's peace talks in Riyadh.

After President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff raised hopes of “real progress” on a Black Sea ceasefire in Monday's peace talks between United States and Russian negotiators, the Kremlin played down hopes for rapid progress, saying that numerous questions remain to be resolved.

The talks in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, were focused on technical aspects of monitoring a 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure, after  each side accused the other of breaches and following a U.S. effort to broaden the ceasefire to include Black Sea navigation.

Witkoff told Fox News on Sunday that he expected “some real progress, particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries. And from that, you'll naturally gravitate into a full-on shooting ceasefire.”

But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov raised Russia's complex demands around the 2022-2023 Black Sea grain initiative, a further sign that Moscow's tactic may be to carefully slow the peace negotiations without outright rejecting them, while maintaining its hard-line conditions for a full ceasefire.

Russia abandoned the grain deal in July 2023, claiming its demands were never met.

“In general, of course, there are many, many different aspects of the settlement to be worked out,” Peskov said. He said the Black Sea initiative “in its past form implied the fulfillment of a number of obligations to the Russian Federation, but they were not fulfilled.”

During 2023 negotiations on the Black Sea grain initiative, Russia claimed that its agricultural exports were being blocked by the West, despite not being under sanction. Western exemptions also allowed for payments to a Russian bank for agricultural products.

But after Russia's 2023 decision to abandon that deal, Ukraine continued to export grain through the Black Sea, avoiding the threat of Russian strikes by hugging waters closer to the shore.

Kyiv, meanwhile, has carried out strikes on Russia's Black Sea fleet vessels using its own sea drones, and it claims to have destroyed a third of the Black Sea fleet, including the flagship vessel Moskva. Russia has used its vessels in the Black Sea to launch cruise missile strikes on Ukraine.

Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent Russian pro-Kremlin foreign policy analyst, reflected Russia's satisfaction about the Trump administration's handling of the talks,  writing on Telegram that “everything is going according to the Russian scenario.”

He said Russian President Vladimir Putin's success in deflecting Trump's demand for a full ceasefire was part of Russia's tactics to slow the peace talks.

“The Kremlin has blunted the White House's momentum generated by the Jeddah talks and has turned the discussion into a lingering one,” he wrote, referring to a meeting this month when Ukraine accepted the United States' proposal for a full ceasefire. “Moscow believes that it is in its own interests right now,” he wrote, adding that the initiative on the battlefield was “on Russia's side.”

A document prepared last month for the Kremlin, written by an influential Moscow-based think tank close to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), said that “a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crisis cannot happen before 2026” and discussed the need for “the complete dismantling” of the current Ukrainian government.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova also played down hopes of swift progress Monday.

“It is necessary not so much to wait for breakthroughs but to understand that work is going on a number of directions. This is one of them,” she told Russian media Monday.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday underscored Moscow's continued hard-line stance when he said Russia will pay “constant attention [to] the solution to the problem of denazification of the state that remains under the control of the Kyiv regime.”

Russia has used this formulation as part of its drive to remove President Volodymyr Zelensky and his government, claiming he is illegitimate.

The U.S. delegation at Monday's talks was led by Andrew Peek, a senior director at the White House National Security Council, and Michael Anton, a senior State Department official, Reuters reported.

A member of Russia's negotiation team gave away little in comments to media during a break in Monday's talks. Grigory Karasin, a Russian senator who spent decades in the Foreign Ministry and was in charge of the Ukraine portfolio, said the negotiations were “going on creatively.” He said that “an interesting discussion on quite pressing subjects is going on.”

Asked about the possibility of an agreement in Monday's talks, Karasin said: “Not all negotiations necessarily yield some major documents and agreements. It's important to maintain contact all the time and understand each other's standpoint. That's what we've managed to do.”

Witkoff in Sunday's Fox News interview drew controversy when he repeated Putin's false claim that parts of eastern and southern Ukraine were Russian because of widely criticized referendums held in 2022.

“There's a view within — within the country of Russia that — that these are Russian territories, that there are referendums within these territories that justify these actions,” Witkoff said. “This is not me taking sides.”

Witkoff did not acknowledge that the referendums were staged and held under military occupation, with some residents saying they were forced to vote under threat, at times in their homes in the presence of heavily armed soldiers.

In October 2022, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling on Russia to reverse course on the “attempted illegal annexation” of the territories, weeks after Putin signed an decree illegally claiming to annex the regions.

Neurosafe procedure allows doctors to remove prostate while preserving as much nerve tissue around it as possible

A more precise form of prostate cancer surgery nearly doubles the chances of men retaining erectile function afterwards compared with standard surgery, according to the first comprehensive trial of the procedure.

Doctors in five UK hospitals assessed the surgical approach that aims to preserve crucial nerves that run through the outer layer of the prostate and are thought to be responsible for producing erections.

Known as NeuroSafe, the procedure involves checking prostate tissue removed from the patient while the operation is under way. If the examination suggests the tumour has been removed, the nerve-containing outer layer of the prostate can be left intact, reducing the patient's risk of erectile problems.

Prof Greg Shaw, the trial lead and a consultant urologist at University College London hospitals NHS foundation trust, said: “This procedure gives surgeons feedback during the surgery to give them the certainty they need to spare as many nerves as possible and give men increased hope of recovering their sexual potency after their cancer is surgically removed.”

Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in men in England, with 50,000 cases diagnosed each year. Worldwide, nearly 1.5 million men are diagnosed and 375,000 die annually. The disease is most common in over-50s and is often called a silent killer because it causes no symptoms in the early stages.

Recent developments in robotic surgery have allowed doctors to perform precision “nerve-sparing” operations in prostate cancer patients. This involves removing the diseased prostate while leaving the outer layers and the nerves running through them.

However, doctors must be sure that no cancer cells are left behind, and this can be difficult to assess. If the cancer is advanced, surgeons will err on the side of caution and remove the prostate with its outer layers to reduce the risk of missing any tumour cells and the disease returning.

In the NeuroSafe procedure, doctors remove the prostate while preserving as much nerve tissue around it as possible. Slices of the prostate are then frozen, stained and examined for cancer cells. If the tumour reaches the surface of the prostate, the outer layers and its nerves may need to be removed. But if the tumour stops short, the surgery is considered complete.

The trial assessed 344 men with prostate cancer who had no history of erectile dysfunction. Half received the NeuroSafe procedure and half underwent standard surgery. A year later, 56% of men who had standard surgery reported severe erectile dysfunction, compared with 38% who had NeuroSafe surgery.

Less than a quarter (23%) who had standard surgery reported no or only mild erectile dysfunction, compared with 39% who had the NeuroSafe procedure. Details were presented at the 2025 European Association of Urology congress in Madrid and are published in the Lancet Oncology.

Dr Matthew Hobbs, the director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “Prostate cancer surgery is a life-saving option for lots of men, but it's a major procedure that can cause side-effects like erection problems. A major challenge we face is how to cure men but also ensure they can live life to the full afterwards.

“This study is promising and provides evidence that innovative types of surgery can reduce erectile dysfunction in some men. However, more research is needed to prove whether NeuroSafe is as effective as traditional techniques at delivering a complete cure.

“We also need to understand exactly which men could benefit from this new technique and, crucially, whether this technique could be delivered at scale across the NHS to make it accessible to men across the UK.”

Elderly woman with dementia found in home she shared with daughter, with over 24 dogs running loose

A woman in Colorado is facing dozens of criminal charges after her 76-year-old mother with dementia was found mauled to death among more than two dozen dogs living at their home.

Jessica Hoff, 47, was arrested on Friday in connection to the death of LaVonne Hoff, said a news release from the sheriff's office in Pueblo county, Colorado, that laid out a case containing elder and animal neglect allegations.

The sheriff's office said first responders pronounced Hoff dead at the Colorado City home which she shared with her daughter after deputies had been called to investigate a report about an unconscious woman on 3 February. Deputies noted that there were several dogs running around the Hoffs' home – and there were about 24 other dogs and seven birds in cages there.

An autopsy later revealed that LaVonne Hoff had died of injuries resulting from a dog attack, the sheriff's office said. Before she died, her daughter had left her home alone to run errands about 25 miles away in Pueblo, and the dogs that were loose at their property mauled the mother, deputies alleged.

Investigators subsequently searched a second property in Colorado City owned by Jessica Hoff. And there, they allegedly discovered 54 more dogs as well as seven more birds in her possession. The animals were “living in unsanitary conditions, and several of the dogs were in poor health”, the sheriff's office wrote in its news release on the case.

Deputies worked with local animal control officers to seize the dogs and birds in question.

Meanwhile, they booked Jessica Hoff on criminal negligence resulting in the death of an at-risk adult as well as 54 counts of aggravated cruelty to animals.

Hoff remained in custody on Monday at the Pueblo county jail, online records show. She was being held in lieu of $50,000 bail.

Under Colorado law, criminal negligence resulting in an at-risk person's death can carry between two and six years in prison. And aggravated cruelty to animals can carry between a year and 18 months in prison.

The leader of the rebels who captured two key cities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo says international sanctions and the planned minerals deal that the country has offered the US will not stop the fighting between their members and Congolese forces in the hard-hit region.

With such sanctions and a bounty placed on the rebel leaders by the Democratic Republic of the Congo's government, “we will fight like people who got nothing to lose in order to secure the future of our country,” Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance (AFC) that includes the M23 rebel group, told The Associated Press.

Mr Nangaa also dismissed Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi's comments last week that his country is looking for a minerals partnership with the US that will bring peace and stability for both countries.

Since launching a major escalation of their decade-long fighting with the Congolese forces in late January, the M23 rebels have captured the cities of Goma and Bukavu and several towns in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, forcing thousands of soldiers to either flee or surrender and prompting fears of regional warfare involving neighbours whose militaries are also on the ground.

Most of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's mineral resources, estimated to be worth 24 trillion dollars (£18.5 trillion) and critical to much of the world's technology, remain untapped, according to the US Department of Commerce last year.

The US government has not publicly spoken about any minerals deal being planned with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which local observers say could be similar to the Trump administration's offer for Ukraine to help end the war with Russia.

“This problem can be better resolved by the concerned Congolese, not foreigners with different geopolitical agendas,” Mr Nangaa told The AP over the weekend.

“Trying to bribe US with mines can undermine US credibility.”

Efforts to achieve a ceasefire collapsed last week after the rebels pulled out from talks being facilitated by Angola, condemning European Union sanctions on its leaders.

Mr Nangaa also rejected the outcome of a meeting between Congolese and Rwandan leaders in Qatar, saying such a move to achieve peace without the group's involvement would fail and that the rebels can only have a dialogue with the Democratic Republic of the Congo's government if the country acknowledges their grievances and the root causes of the conflict.

“Anything regarding us which are done without us, it's against us,” Mr Nangaa said.

Despite calls for a ceasefire, M23 rebels have now seized the key town of Walikale which gives them control of a strategic road linking four provinces in eastern Congo — North Kivu, South Kivu, Tshopo and Maniema — effectively cutting off Congolese army positions.

In seizing more territories beyond Goma — the only city they captured during their short-lived uprising in 2012 — the rebels aim to “secure” citizens in those places and fight the root causes of the conflict, the rebel leader said.

The most potent of about 100 armed factions vying for control in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, M23, is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who failed to integrate into the Congolese army.

The group says it is defending ethnic Tutsis and Congolese of Rwandan origin from discrimination.

Although UN experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces supporting the rebels in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mr Nangaa said the rebel alliance is independent and seeks to address “the root cause of more than 30 years of instability in our country”.

US carmaker's European market share falls as Chinese rival BYD overtakes it on global revenue, topping $100bn

Sales of new Tesla cars slumped in Europe last month in the latest indication of a potential buyer backlash over Elon Musk's high profile and controversial behaviour since becoming a leading figure in Donald Trump's administration.

The Texas-based electric carmaker sold less than 16,000 vehicles across Europe last month, down 44% on average across 25 countries in the EU, the UK, Norway and Switzerland, according to data compiled by the research platform Jato Dynamics.

Tesla's market share fell to 9.6% last month, the lowest it has registered in February for five years. In January, its sales across Europe fell 45%, from 18,161 in 2024 to 9,945.

However, in the UK the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reported an almost 21% rise in the number of new Tesla cars registered in February, with the Model 3 and Model Y proving the second and third most popular after the Mini Cooper.

Analysts and investors have been attempting to assess what impact Musk's political interventions are having on the carmaker, where he is chief executive, amid signs that his senior role in Trump's administration is leading to a consumer backlash by some Tesla owners or prospective buyers. Tesla dealerships have also been the target of protests.

The tech billionaire and close Trump adviser has shown support for Germany's far-right AfD party, theatrically brandished a “chainsaw of democracy” at a conservative conference, and accused Keir Starmer and other senior politicians of covering up the scandal about grooming gangs.

However, analysts have said that the volatile sales are also likely to have been affected by Tesla's overhaul of the Model Y.

Felipe Muñoz, a global analyst at Jato Dynamics, said: “Tesla is experiencing a period of immense change. In addition to Elon Musk's increasingly active role in politics and the increased competition it is facing within the EV market, the brand is phasing out the existing version of the Model Y – its bestselling vehicle – before it rolls out the update.

“Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover.”

The research company's figures for February show that Tesla's rivals powered ahead in Europe last month.

Volkswagen reported a 180% increase in sales of battery electric vehicles to just under 20,000, while BMW and Mini sold a combined 19,000 such models last month.

The Chinese-owned BYD recorded a 94% increase in sales in Europe to more than 4,000. Separate figures show that BYD's global sales topped $100bn (£83bn) last year, overtaking Tesla as the world's biggest electric car company by revenue.

BYD, which last beat Tesla on global annual revenues in 2018, reported revenues of 777bn yuan (£86bn) in 2024, a 29% year-on-year increase, beating analyst estimates. Tesla reported annual revenues of $97.7bn last year.

BYD also sells about the same number of electric vehicles as Tesla – 1.76m compared with 1.79m respectively in 2024. However, when sales of BYD's other hybrid cars are included it is much larger.

Polestar, which is primarily owned by Volvo's parent company, Geely, recorded an 84% increase to more than 2,000 vehicles.

BYD sold 4.27m vehicles last year, almost as many as the 4.5m sold by Ford, and has forecast that it will sell between 5m and 6m this year. The Hong Kong-listed company has a market value of about $160bn, up about 50% so far this year. Tesla is valued at $780bn despite a share-price plunge of more than a third in 2025. Tesla shares opened up 6% on Monday as the wider Nasdaq index rose nearly 2%.

Total car sales in across the 25 EU markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland dropped by 3% to 970,000 in February, while BEV registrations were up by a quarter.

Even some Republicans have called president's public demand to remove the painting ‘petty'

Donald Trump critics aimed ridicule at the president after he publicly demanded the removal of his portrait at Colorado's state capitol building, calling it “truly the worst”.

In a post on his Truth Social platform on Sunday, Trump shared an image of the portrait and complained about the painting, saying it was bad and blaming it on Colorado's governor, Jared Polis – whom the president insulted as being “radically left”.

A Republican admirer of Trump actually commissioned the portrait.

In two follow-up posts, Trump shared separate images of himself in an apparent attempt to distribute photos that he considered more flattering.

Liberal and anti-Trump commentators laughed at the president's reaction on social media.

On X, Sam Stein of MSNBC wrote that he was “absolutely dying” over how Trump was so upset by his portrait “that he couldn't resist posting” about it. Stein said it was also funny “how objectively bad the portrait is”.

Former Republican attorney Ron Filipkowski, editor-in-chief of the liberal news website MeidasTouch Network, wrote on X that Trump was “the most fragile, sensitive snowflake in history” while sharing a screenshot of the president's Truth Social post.

Another social media account named Republicans Against Trump also shared the president's post while calling him “a petty, insecure baby”.

Trump alleged without evidence that his portrait had been “purposefully distorted”. The president then complained that his Democratic presidential predecessor Barack Obama “looks wonderful” in his portrait at the Colorado capitol.

Despite Trump's criticism of Polis for the painting, it was actually unveiled by a Republican group in 2019. A former Republican state senator had crowdfunded nearly $10,000 to commission the painting, according to Colorado news station KUSA.

Trump did not have a portrait hanging in the Colorado state capitol for his first presidency, which began in 2017. In 2018, a liberal political activist placed a large portrait of Vladimir Putin – whom Trump openly admires – in the empty space, but it was quickly removed by capitol staff.

That prompted then Republican state senator Kevin Grantham to raise money through a GoFundMe campaign to hang Trump's portrait in the state capitol.

“I would much prefer not having a picture than having this one,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post, and further said the governor “should be ashamed of himself”!

It was unclear what triggered Trump's tirade about the portrait.

A Polis spokesperson told KUSA that the governor was “surprised to learn the President of the United States is an aficionado of our Colorado state capitol and its artwork”.

“We appreciate the president and everyone's interest in our capitol building and are always looking for any opportunity to improve our visitor experience,” the Polis spokesperson added.

March 24 (UPI) -- China reassured executives from American and European firms, including Apple, Qualcomm, Mastercard, Pfizer and AstraZeneca, that the world's second-largest economy is open for business amid a looming tariffs threat to its export-dependent economy.
Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng told CEOs Tim Cook, Qualcomm's Cristiano Amon and Pascal Soriot of AstraZeneca, along with U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., attending a two-day conference in Beijing on Sunday that the country was looking for more foreign investment from international companies as it continues to open its economy.

"China remains committed to expanding high-level opening-up of its market, improving the business environment and welcoming more multinational companies to deepen their investment in China," said He, who stressed that China especially wanted to build deeper economic and trade relationships with United States and other multinational firms.
Overseas investment into China has been hit as its economic expansion transitions to more normal levels from the stratospheric gross domestic product growth seen in the two decades before the financial crisis amid a failure to get Chinese consumers to open their pocketbooks and a massive real estate bubble that burst in 2023.

Earlier, at the opening of the China Development Forum, Premier Li Qiang urged countries not to succumb to "growing economic fragmentation," open their markets instead, and called on business leaders to be "staunch defenders and promoters of globalization."
Trade relations with the United States have been hit hard after President Donald Trump doubled tariffs on Chinese imports to 20% on March 4 in an effort to redress what he believes is the deeply unfair issue of a decades-old trade deficit that hit $295.4 billion in 2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures.
China retaliated earlier this month with tariffs of between 10% and 15% on 740 categories of U.S. goods, mainly farm products. The White House is expected to unveil "reciprocal tariffs" on numerous trading partners, with next month's move -- designed to bring manufacturing back to America -- having the potential to push the tariffs on China even higher.
Li said that while China was prepared for economic shocks that came out of the blue, he cautioned that "decoupling and breaking supply chains would only deepen crises."
He added that China was committed to making it easier for foreign investors to access a number of different sectors, calling for "win-win" U.S.-China cooperation given the "extensive common interests and broad space of cooperation" the two countries shared.

"If the world returns to the law of the jungle, it will be a step backward in history and a tragedy for humanity. "We have prepared for possible unexpected shocks, which, of course, mainly come from external sources. Where necessary, the Chinese government will introduce new policies to ensure the smooth operation of the Chinese economy," Li said.
Daines, a close confidante of Trump, met with Li on Sunday for talks he described as a "first step" toward setting up a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
In a post on his account on X, Daines thanked Li for meeting with the CEOs of seven big U.S. companies and hearing how committed they were to their decades-long operations in China, but also about the current challenges they faced.
Daines also conveyed a message from Trump reiterating his call for Beijing to take decisive steps to "stop the flow of fentanyl precursors and end their devastating impact on the American people."

March 24 (UPI) -- China reassured executives from American and European firms, including Apple, Qualcomm, Mastercard, Pfizer and AstraZeneca, that the world's second-largest economy is open for business amid a looming tariffs threat to its export-dependent economy.

Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng told CEOs Tim Cook, Qualcomm's Cristiano Amon and Pascal Soriot of AstraZeneca, along with U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., attending a two-day conference in Beijing on Sunday that the country was looking for more foreign investment from international companies as it continues to open its economy.

"China remains committed to expanding high-level opening-up of its market, improving the business environment and welcoming more multinational companies to deepen their investment in China," said He, who stressed that China especially wanted to build deeper economic and trade relationships with United States and other multinational firms.

Overseas investment into China has been hit as its economic expansion transitions to more normal levels from the stratospheric gross domestic product growth seen in the two decades before the financial crisis amid a failure to get Chinese consumers to open their pocketbooks and a massive real estate bubble that burst in 2023.

Earlier, at the opening of the China Development Forum, Premier Li Qiang urged countries not to succumb to "growing economic fragmentation," open their markets instead, and called on business leaders to be "staunch defenders and promoters of globalization."

Trade relations with the United States have been hit hard after President Donald Trump doubled tariffs on Chinese imports to 20% on March 4 in an effort to redress what he believes is the deeply unfair issue of a decades-old trade deficit that hit $295.4 billion in 2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures.

China retaliated earlier this month with tariffs of between 10% and 15% on 740 categories of U.S. goods, mainly farm products. The White House is expected to unveil "reciprocal tariffs" on numerous trading partners, with next month's move -- designed to bring manufacturing back to America -- having the potential to push the tariffs on China even higher.

Li said that while China was prepared for economic shocks that came out of the blue, he cautioned that "decoupling and breaking supply chains would only deepen crises."

He added that China was committed to making it easier for foreign investors to access a number of different sectors, calling for "win-win" U.S.-China cooperation given the "extensive common interests and broad space of cooperation" the two countries shared.

"If the world returns to the law of the jungle, it will be a step backward in history and a tragedy for humanity. "We have prepared for possible unexpected shocks, which, of course, mainly come from external sources. Where necessary, the Chinese government will introduce new policies to ensure the smooth operation of the Chinese economy," Li said.

Daines, a close confidante of Trump, met with Li on Sunday for talks he described as a "first step" toward setting up a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

In a post on his account on X, Daines thanked Li for meeting with the CEOs of seven big U.S. companies and hearing how committed they were to their decades-long operations in China, but also about the current challenges they faced.

Daines also conveyed a message from Trump reiterating his call for Beijing to take decisive steps to "stop the flow of fentanyl precursors and end their devastating impact on the American people."

Trump was responding to Clooney's call to defend press freedoms while promoting his new stage version of Good Night, and Good Luck

Donald Trump has taken aim at the actor and prominent Democrat activist George Clooney, dismissing his interview on US TV news programme 60 Minutes as a “total puff piece”.

The Oscar-winning star was the subject of Sunday's show to promote his Broadway debut, in a stage version of the film Good Night, and Good Luck, in which he plays veteran journalist Edward R Murrow, who took part in a historic TV showdown with Senator Joseph McCarthy.

In the interview, Clooney, 63, spoke about his decision to drop his support for Joe Biden, penning an op-ed in the New York Times thought to be key in Biden's decision to step down. The battle between the government and the press, said Clooney, is a “fight for the ages”.

“You see it happening at the LA Times, you see it happening at the Washington Post,” he said, in reference to protests by staff at the two titles at their rightwing owners, both of whom clamped down on the papers choosing to endorse a candidate at last year's election.

Clooney drew parallels between the events Good Night, and Good Luck dramatises and the difficulties faced by reporters in pursuit of truth today. The actor cited Trump's $16m recent defamation settlement with ABC News, as well as the $20bn “voter interference” suit Trump filed against CBS last October in which he claimed 60 Minutes had “deceptively edited” an interview with his rival, Kamala Harris, to present her in a more flattering light.

Said Clooney: “When the other three estates fail, when the judiciary and the executive and the legislative branches fail us, the fourth estate has to succeed.”

“ABC has just settled a lawsuit with the Trump administration. And CBS News is in the process … We're seeing this idea of using government to scare or fine or use corporations – to make journalists smaller.”

“Governments don't like the freedom of the press. They never have. And that goes for whether you are a conservative or a liberal or whatever side you're on. They don't like the press,” he added.

Trump took to Truth Social to combat Clooney's arguments, and to offer a broadside against the show.

“Why would the now highly discredited 60 Minutes be doing a total ‘puff piece' on George Clooney, a second-rate movie ‘star' and failed political pundit,” wrote Trump.

“He fought hard for Sleepy Joe's election, and then, right after the Debate, dumped him like a dog. Later, I assume under orders from the Obama camp, pushed all out for ‘Kamala,' only to soon realise that this was not going to work out too well.”

He then reiterated his earlier claims against the show, saying: “60 Minutes even fraudulently inserted Fake answers into her disastrous interview, aired just before Election Day, in one of the most embarrassing and dishonest events in broadcast history … And now George Clooney again? His press agent should be making a fortune!!!”

Asked about his article asking Biden to step down as he felt he simply “cannot win”, Clooney, whose father was a journalist, said: “I'll make it kind of easy. I was raised to tell the truth.

“I had seen the president up close for this fundraiser, and I was surprised. And so I feel as if there was a lot of profiles in cowardice in my party through all of that. And I was not proud of that. And I also believed I had to tell the truth …

At the time, Trump hit back at Clooney for his article, calling him a “fake movie actor” who “never came close to making a great movie”.

“What does Clooney know about anything?” Trump added. “Clooney should get out of politics and go back to television. Movies never really worked for him!!!”

Appearing on Stephen Colbert's talkshow last week to promote his play, Clooney was asked about his feelings about the defeat of Harris last year.

“Well I don't know, what am I supposed to do? Storm the fucking Capitol?” he said in reference to the 6 January insurrection, to applause from the audience. Without saying Trump's name, Clooney also had a message for the new president, saying: “Good for you. I hope you do well because our country needs it, and we will meet you in 3.5 years and see where we go next.”

Turkish authorities detained several journalists from their homes, a media workers' union said, calling it a crackdown amid growing protests triggered by the jailing of Istanbul's mayor, a top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

A court on Sunday formally arrested mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and ordered him jailed pending a trial on corruption charges.

His detention on Wednesday sparked the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade, deepening concerns over democracy and the rule of law.

The Disk-Basin-Is union said at least eight reporters and photojournalists were detained in what it called an “attack on press freedoms and the people's right to learn the truth”.

It called for their immediate release.

The social media platform X, formerly Twitter, said it was objecting to multiple court orders from Turkish authorities to block more than 700 accounts, including of news organisations, journalists and political figures in Turkey.

– Hundreds of protesters detained

A total of 1,133 people have been detained since the mayor was arrested at his home, interior minister Ali Yerlikaya said.

As many as 123 police officers were injured in the protests, he said, adding that materials such as acid, firebombs and knives were seized.

“Some circles have been exploiting the right to assemble and demonstrate, attempting to disrupt public order, incite street unrest and attack our police,” Mr Yerlikaya said on social media.

The minister said some of the detained were identified as having ties to groups listed as terrorist organisations and others had criminal records.

Hundreds of thousands of people have come out for the largely peaceful protests across Turkey in support of the mayor.

There has been some violence, with police deploying water cannons, tear gas and pepper spray and firing plastic pellets at protesters in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir.

Some protesters hurled stones, fireworks and other objects at riot police.

– Mayor urges more rallies

In a message on social media, Imamoglu urged people to rally outside city hall and other locations for a sixth night on Monday.

He also called on youths to avoid clashes and asked police to treat demonstrators with kindness.

“I'm working hard, I will work even harder. Where I am does not matter,” he said.

The mayor's jailing is widely regarded as a political move to remove a major challenger to Erdogan from the next presidential race, scheduled for 2028.

Government officials reject the accusations and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently.

Imamoglu was jailed on suspicion of running a criminal organisation, accepting bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and bid-rigging — accusations he has denied.

A request for him to be imprisoned on terror-related charges was rejected although he still faces prosecution.

The Interior Ministry later said Imamoglu had been suspended from duty as a “temporary measure”.

The municipality previously appointed an acting mayor from its governing council.

Imamoglu was taken to Silivri prison, west of Istanbul, as more than 1.7 million members of his opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, held a primary election, endorsing him as its presidential candidate.

Millions of non-members also cast votes in a “solidarity ballot,” the party said.

Alongside Imamoglu, 47 other people were also jailed pending trial, including a key aide and two district mayors from Istanbul.

One was replaced with a government appointee. A further 44 suspects were released under judicial control.

– Ankara municipality also under scrutiny

Meanwhile, authorities were investigating the office of Ankara's mayor, another popular opposition figure, over the alleged misuse of public funds concerning the organization of 33 concerts, the municipality said on Monday.

It said the decision was made even though the concerts had been thoroughly audited.

Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019, in a major blow to Mr Erdogan and the president's Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century.

Mr Erdogan's party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.

The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won.

The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which the CHP made significant gains against Mr Erdogan's governing party.

A court formally arrested the mayor of Istanbul and key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan early on Sunday and ordered him to be jailed pending the outcome of a trial on corruption charges. Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was detained following a raid on his residence earlier this week, sparking the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade..

Officials said on Monday that Turkish police have detained several journalists and more than 1,100 citizens who protested against the arrest of Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, President Erdogan's main political rival. The arrest has drawn international condemnation and protests have spread to more than 55 of Turkey's 81 provinces. Police have detained more than 1,100 people, officials said Monday – including journalists – since the arrest of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main rival triggered s

Displeased would be an understatement to describe the way leaders in Greenland are feeling about the planned visit of the Second Lady of the United States, Usha Vance. In less than 24 hours since the high-profile visit was announced by Washington, there has been severe criticism across the semi-autonomous Danish territory that Donald Trump has threatened to annex for national security reasons.

Greenland's prime minister and the interim government has decided to boycott the visit.

The delegation, led by Usha Vance, will visit the US military base in Greenland. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright will be part of the delegation. The visit comes two months after President Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., went to Greenland for what was described as "a private visit".

The US delegation visit will be from Thursday, March 27 to Saturday, March 29, 2025.

Donald Trump has, on several occasions, repeated his stance that the US aims to "buy Greenland", almost suggesting that there are no other options left. He has not ruled out Washington's use of force to achieve this goal.

President Trump has said it is "necessary" to make Greenland, which is known to be rich in mineral resources, part of the US, citing national security reasons.

Greenland's outgoing prime minister, Mute Egede, has called the high-profile US visit "a provocation", and said that they are not welcome in the country. Stopping a visit to the US military base would not be possible due to treaty obligations, but the interim government will not be meeting the US delegation, he said.

"Until recently, we could trust the Americans, who were our allies and friends, and with whom we enjoyed working very closely, but that time is over," Greenland's prime minister said.

The Greenlandic government, Naalakkersuisut, is currently in a caretaker phase following a March 11 parliamentary election won by the Democrats, a pro-business party that favours a slow approach to independence from Denmark.

Jens-Frederik Nielsen, leader of the Democrats, called for political unity and strongly criticized the timing of the US delegation's visit. "We must not be forced into a power game that we ourselves have not chosen to be a part of," Mr Nielsen said.

Ahead of her visit, Second Lady Usha Vance, shared a video via the US consulate in Greenland, in which she said her visit to Greenland is meant to "celebrate the long history of mutual respect and cooperation between our nations".

Amid mounting flak in Greenland, the White House has said that "This is a visit to learn about Greenland, its culture, history, and people and to attend a dogsled race the United States is proud to sponsor, plain and simple."

"The visit aims to build on partnerships that respects Greenland's self-determination and advances economic cooperation," White House spokesperson Brian Hughes said.

According to news agency Reuters, to prepare for the visit, Washington has already sent two US Hercules military transport planes, carrying security personnel and bulletproof vehicles. Denmark has also sent dozens of police personnel to Greenland's capital Nuuk to boost the delegation's security.

The US National Security Adviser and Energy Secretary plan to visit US' space base in Pituffik, which is located along the shortest route from Europe to North America, and is vital for ballistic missile warning systems.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said that the top US delegation announcing a visit is "something we take very seriously". She added that on matters of "the fundamental rules of sovereignty", Denmark expects the United States to respect Copenhagen and the government of Greenland.

US Vice President JD Vance lambasted Denmark for not being a “good ally” amid POTUS Donald Trump's desire to buy the island. 

In an interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday morning, Vance was asked to share his thoughts if the United States could purchase Greenland. He responded, “I think it's possible, Maria.”

“Here's the thing which I think a lot of folks don't appreciate about Greenland. It's really important to our national security,” Vance claimed.

The US Vice President clarified that the Russians and Chinese use “sea lanes” that encircle Greenland, the largest island in the world. He slammed the Danish government by accusing it of “not doing its job” and “not being a good ally” by limiting US access.

Vance said that gaining “more territorial interest in Greenland” was the only practical way to address the national security problem.

“That is what President Trump is going to do because he doesn't care what the Europeans scream at us; he cares about putting the interests of American citizens first,” he said, emphasizing that the President will seize the island if necessary.

In a Truth Social post in January, Trump declared that “the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,” garnering massive flak from the island.

Greenland Prime Minister Mute B. Egede blasted the Trump administration for adopting a “highly aggressive” strategy after a group of top US officials visited the region last week.

During the interview, Vance went on to claim that people of Greenland “were not actually happy with [the] Danish government.” In contrast to his assertion, 85 percent of Greenlanders opposed the idea of becoming a US territory, according to The Guardian report.

Vance further asserted that Greenland was “an incredibly bountiful country,” underscoring the US' ambition to obtain the island's abundant natural riches.

According to a White House press release, Second Lady Usha Vance and her son will arrive in Greenland on Thursday. They will “visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenlands' national dogsled race.”

Mike Waltz, Trump's security advisor, is also traveling to the island with US Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

Meanwhile, Denmark PM too targetted Trump administration over recent Greenland visit by US officials. 

In a statement,  Mette Frederiksen said that “visit from the United States cannot be seen in isolation from the public statements that have been made. This is something we take seriously.”

        The discovery follows the detention of a Bulgarian woman accused of spying for the Kremlin in December.
    

The Kremlin deployed a disinformation campaign targeting Ukraine and sparking pro-Russian sentiment across German-speaking countries, Austrian authorities revealed on Monday.

The investigation showed that a cell working for Russian intelligence was set up shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. 

It intended to influence public opinion against Ukraine and its President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, both online and on the ground mostly in Austria, by using far-right and nationalist stickers and graffiti, which it claimed pro-Ukrainian activists were behind.  

"The direct goal of this disinformation cell was to use targeted actions in the context of the war to negatively influence public opinion against Ukraine ... thereby generating – at a higher level – pro-Russian sentiment," a statement from Austria's domestic intelligence agency said. 

The agency said it discovered the operation as it analysed devices belonging to a Bulgarian citizen detained in December on suspicion of spying for the Kremlin. 

The woman, who has not been named so far, is suspected of playing a "significant" role in the campaign: distributing content in both Germany and Austria and acting as a contact for Russian intelligence for accomplices in Russia and the UK.

She has admitted to working for the cell and has been released on bail, according to Austria's Press Agency.

Prime Minister Han Duck-soo returned as acting president, pledging to protect South Korean interests amid the Trump trade war and manage “geopolitical upheaval.”

SEOUL — South Korea's Constitutional Court reinstated Prime Minister Han Duck-soo as acting president Monday, overturning the National Assembly's vote to impeach him and returning him to office during an extraordinary time of political turmoil.

The court has not, however, given a date for its highly anticipated ruling on the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was suspended from his duties after briefly imposing martial law on Dec. 3, a move that put Han — for a short time — in the acting president role.

Tens of thousands of protesters — both supporters and opponents of Yoon — filled the streets of Seoul over the weekend as both sides urge the court to make a decision and — one way or another — bring about an end to the prolonged political crisis.

That, however, seems unlikely in a deeply polarized country.

Separate from the Constitutional Court's impeachment hearings, Yoon is facing a criminal trial on charges that he led an insurrection when he ordered martial law troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from gathering there in December. He denies the charges.

Local media are calling this week a “super week” of landmark rulings because the Supreme Court is due to decide Wednesday on an appeal by Lee Jae-myung, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party and front-runner to win a presidential election if Yoon is removed from office, against his conviction for an violating election law.

“This is one of those weeks where history does change,” said Joung W. Hwang, a lawyer and former law professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “Korea is definitely at an inflection point. There's no doubt about that.”

After Yoon was impeached on Dec. 14, Han took over the role of acting president. But lawmakers in the opposition-dominated National Assembly alleged Han was involved in Yoon's plans to declare martial law.

Han denied that, testifying that Yoon told him less than two hours before the decree that he had intended to declare martial law. A technocratic career public servant who has served in liberal and conservative administrations, Han said he disagreed with Yoon and convened a cabinet meeting to try to persuade the president to change his mind.

Han was nevertheless impeached in a National Assembly vote on Dec. 27, and finance minister Choi Sang-mok took over as the third leader in a month.

Choi saw the country through its worst aviation disaster just days later, then the return of President Donald Trump, who has levied tariffs that threaten South Korea's manufacturing industry and questioned whether the United States is paying too much to defend allies like South Korea.

But opposition parties, unhappy with Choi's actions on appointing more judges to the Constitutional Court, submitted a motion on Friday to oust him, too — the 30th Democratic Party-led impeachment motion since Yoon took office in 2022.

They had 72 hours to bring the motion to a vote, but their efforts were overtaken by the Constitutional Court's decision to reinstate Han.

The back-to-back efforts to impeach the nation's top leaders have created a leadership crisis during a critical time.

Han promised Monday to use his remaining time in office to protect South Korea's interests in the face of Trump's trade war and to navigate the “geopolitical upheaval” that has taken place since he returned to the White House.

“I sincerely request bipartisan efforts so that South Korea can overcome the current crisis and move forward and upward,” Han said in a speech Monday.

Some conservatives — and Yoon's office on Monday — have accused the Democratic Party of abusing its power by moving to impeach political figures in the president's orbit.

Analysts have also warned it could set a dangerous precedent in which parties overuse impeachment proceedings as a means to fight their political opponents and paralyze the opposition.

“When there's a party where the majority can temporarily remove people from office, that can be a remarkably destabilizing power,” said Benjamin Thompson, a political science professor at Kyungpook National University in Daegu. “There's no guarantee that only this party will do it in the future, either.”

But some conservative figures and protesters have been driven by baseless conspiracy theories, some involving election fraud.

“Korea has historically had this sort of standard, partisan divide,” Thompson said. “What's different this time is the counter protests on the street, the level of online activism and the apparent increase of some elements of extremism in these protests, which I find to be a little disconcerting.”

That political instability has also led to increased division and tension in South Korea, with near-daily protests in the center of Seoul, culminating in the weekend's rival rallies.

Lawmakers and citizens have been shaving their heads in public and embarking on hunger strikes. One Yoon supporter died of injuries he sustained after setting himself on fire.

Law enforcement officials are preparing for potential social unrest on the day of the Yoon ruling. Thousands of riot police officers will be deployed to the court and its surrounding areas in case of violence or attacks on the court facilities, police officials said. Schools in the vicinity of the court are planning to shut down on the day of the ruling.

If the court decides to remove Yoon from office, Han would remain the caretaker head of state until a presidential election is held, within 60 days. If Yoon's presidential powers are restored, he would return to office immediately, and Han would continue to serve as prime minister.

US negotiators worked to hammer out details of a proposed partial ceasefire in Ukraine on Monday, meeting with representatives from Russia a day after holding separate talks with the Ukrainian team.

Each side has accused the other of undermining efforts to reach a pause in the three-year-old war.

Kyiv and Moscow agreed in principle on Wednesday to a limited ceasefire after US President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders, but the parties have offered different views of what targets would be off-limits to attack.

While the White House said “energy and infrastructure” would be covered, the Kremlin declared that the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure”.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he would also like to see railways and ports protected.

Talks on Monday are expected to address some of those differences, as well as a potential pause in attacks in the Black Sea to ensure the safety of commercial shipping.

US and Russian representatives began meeting in the morning in the Saudi capital, Russia's state Tass and Ria-Novosti news agencies reported.

The US and Ukrainian teams met on Sunday in Riyadh, and more contacts were expected, though it was not clear when.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday the Russian military is fulfilling President Vladimir Putin's order to halt attacks on energy facilities for 30 days.

Mr Peskov accused Ukraine of derailing the partial ceasefire with an attack on a gas metering station in Sudzha in Russia's Kursk region.

Ukraine's military general staff rejected Moscow's accusations and blamed the Russian military for shelling the station, a claim Mr Peskov called “absurd”.

Meanwhile, Russian troops launched a new barrage of drones, including decoys, into Ukraine overnight into Monday, according to Ukraine's air force, causing some damage and injuries.

Before the latest attack, Mr Zelensky said in a televised statement Sunday evening that “since March 11, a proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table, and these attacks could have already stopped. But it is Russia that continues all this”.

He added that Ukraine's partners — “the US, Europe, and others around the world” — should step up pressure on Russia “to stop this terror”.

Mr Zelensky has emphasized that Ukraine is open to a full, 30-day ceasefire that Mr Trump has proposed.

But Mr Putin has made a complete ceasefire conditional on a halt of arms supplies to Kyiv and a suspension of Ukraine's military mobilisation — demands rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies.

Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Mr Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said he expected “some real progress” at the talks in Saudi Arabia, and that a pause in hostilities between both countries in the Black Sea would “naturally gravitate into a full-on shooting ceasefire”.

Serhii Leshchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidency, said the delegation remained in Riyadh on Monday and expected to meet again with the Americans.

– China rules out supplying peacekeeping forces

Asked about reports speculating that China might send peacekeepers to Ukraine to enforce any future peace deal, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun responded on Monday with an unequivocal no.

“Let me stress that the report is completely false. China's position on the Ukraine crisis is clear and consistent,” Mr Guo said at a daily briefing.

China has provided Russia with trade earnings from oil and other natural resources, along with diplomatic backing, but has not given any weapons or sent any personnel.

China is, however, on close terms with North Korea, which has sent troops to fight alongside the Russian army.

– Ukrainian railways hit by cyberattack

A “massive targeted cyberattack” hit Ukrainian state railway operator Ukrzaliznytsia on Sunday, the company wrote on Telegram, adding that the restoration of its systems was ongoing as of Monday morning.

The company said the attack did not affect train movements or schedules, but that the online booking system was currently unavailable.

“The railway continues to operate despite physical attacks on the infrastructure, and even the most vile cyberattacks cannot stop it,” the company wrote.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's Special Operations Forces claimed to have destroyed four military helicopters in Russia's Belgorod region with the use of American-supplied Himars rocket systems.

The special forces published drone footage of what they said was the attack on their Telegram page on Monday.

The group wrote that the strikes had occurred at a concealed “jumping-off point” for Russian aircraft used in surprise attacks on Ukrainian forces.

Russian troops, meanwhile, fired 99 attack and decoy drones into Ukraine overnight Sunday, according to Ukraine's air force, of which 57 were shot down and 36 were lost from radar.

In the Kyiv region, one man suffered injuries overnight as a Russian drone struck a residential area.

“The man has superficial shrapnel wounds to his abdomen, chest, thighs, and head”, the acting head of the Kyiv region, Mykola Kalashnyk, wrote on Telegram on Monday.

In the Kharkiv region, a Russian drone struck a residential building in the village of Velyka Babka, injuring a 25-year-old man and a pregnant woman.

Both were admitted to hospital, regional head Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram on Monday morning.

In Zaporizhzhia, Russian drones damaged several houses of local residents overnight with one elderly woman suffering light injuries, regional head Ivan Fedorov wrote on Telegram.

Italian and Scottish researchers claim they found a major discovery beneath the Pyramids of Giza, potentially rewriting the history of ancient Egypt. Using radar technology, the team led by Corrado Malanga from Italy's University of Pisa and Filippo Biondi from the University of Strathclyde in Scotland announced the findings of what they describe as a vast underground city stretching more than 6,500 feet directly beneath the pyramids."This groundbreaking study has redefined the boundaries of satellite data analysis and archaeological exploration," said the project's spokesperson, Nicole Ciccolo, according to The Sun. She elaborated that the discovery "could redefine our understanding of the sacred topography of ancient Egypt, providing spatial coordinates for previously unknown and unexplored subterranean structures."  The researchers used a new radar technology known as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which combines satellite radar data with tiny vibrations from naturally occurring seismic movements. This method creates 3D images of what lies beneath the Earth's surface without the need for physical excavation. Their study, still awaiting peer review, suggests that the complex is ten times larger than the pyramids themselves.The team claims to have discovered eight vertical cylinder-shaped structures, referred to as shafts, extending approximately 2,100 feet deep beneath the pyramids. Each shaft is said to be surrounded by spiral pathways that connect to two 80-meter cube-shaped structures. Above these, they reportedly found five multi-level structures connected by passageways. Advertisement"The existence of vast chambers beneath the earth's surface, comparable in size to the pyramids themselves, has a remarkably strong correlation with the legendary Halls of Amenti," Ciccolo stated. She explained that the cylindrical structures were found underneath each of the three pyramids and appear "to serve as access points to this underground system."Several experts have expressed skepticism regarding these claims. Independent experts, including Professor Lawrence Conyers, have raised serious concerns about the study. "I could not tell if the technology used actually picked up hidden structures below the pyramid," Conyers told Daily Mail, calling the claims of a vast city underneath the pyramids "a huge exaggeration." He acknowledged that while small structures such as shafts and chambers might exist beneath the pyramids, the idea of a vast underground city is questionable. "The Mayans and other people in ancient Mesoamerica often built pyramids on top of the entrances of caves or caverns that had ceremonial meaning to them," he explained, according to The Sun. "It is conceivable there are small structures, such as shafts and chambers, beneath the pyramids that existed before they were built because the site was special to ancient people."Critics point out that SAR technology typically excels at detecting shallower features, and its effectiveness diminishes significantly beyond a few meters in solid geological formations.    Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Despite the skepticism, the findings have sparked excitement online. Posts on social media platform X have fueled speculation, with some users suggesting that the structures could support alternative theories about the pyramids functioning as ancient energy systems rather than burial sites—a notion supported by figures such as Nikola Tesla and Christopher Dunn. Advertisement"The megastructure they just found underneath the Giza Pyramids is probably the most important discovery to ever be made in our lifetimes," one user posted, according to Marca. Others have shared similar sentiments, blending hard science with speculative theories.The researchers hope to continue their research but acknowledges that securing approval from the authorities to excavate the area is incredibly tough. "Despite the skepticism, the only way to prove the discoveries are true is through targeted excavations," Conyers added, according to Daily Mail.  The Giza complex, consisting of the pyramids Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, built about 4,500 years ago on a rocky plateau on the west bank of the Nile River in northern Egypt, has long been a subject of intrigue and speculation. Traditionally believed to be royal tombs, these new claims, if substantiated, could potentially challenge the widely accepted understanding of their purpose.While the idea of a hidden underground city is tantalizing, the current evidence remains unverified. Until more concrete data—such as peer-reviewed papers or excavation results—emerges, the scientific community urges caution. The Egyptian government, historically cautious about excavations that challenge established narratives, has not commented on the claims.Egyptian archaeologist Dr. Zahi Hawass vehemently denied the existence of columns beneath the tomb of King Khafre, calling such claims "baseless" and lacking any scientific evidence. "The rumors that have spread about the Egyptian pyramids that there are columns under King Khafre's pyramid have no basis in truth, and there is no scientific evidence to support this claim, and there are no missions working in King Khafre's pyramid now," Hawass stated on his official Facebook page, according to Sabq. He emphasized that the Supreme Council of Antiquities has not granted any permits for work inside King Khafre's pyramid."No radar devices or modern technologies have been used to detect alleged structures beneath the Khafre Pyramid," pointed out Hawass, the former Minister of Antiquities, as reported by Asharq Al-Awsat. He described the claims as "an attempt to undermine ancient Egyptian civilization," adding that "these are failed attempts, and these rumors will go to the dustbin of history," according to Al Arabiya.The claims made by Malanga and Biondi “fall within the realm of exaggeration and deception," said Dr. Hussein Abdel-Basir, Director of the Antiquities Museum at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, according to Asharq Al-Awsat. He stressed that "any real scientific discovery in the field of archaeology must be published first in a reliable scientific journal after careful review by independent experts."Abdel-Basir pointed out that “geophysical techniques, such as Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) or seismic analysis, can scan limited depths, not exceeding tens of meters at best."The details they announced could not have been detected using such methods," remarked Hawass, according to Al-Ahram. The article was written with the assistance of a news analysis system.

The Egyptian government, historically cautious about excavations that challenge established narratives, has not commented on the claims.Egyptian archaeologist Dr. Zahi Hawass vehemently denied the existence of columns beneath the tomb of King Khafre, calling such claims "baseless" and lacking any scientific evidence. "The rumors that have spread about the Egyptian pyramids that there are columns under King Khafre's pyramid have no basis in truth, and there is no scientific evidence to support this claim, and there are no missions working in King Khafre's pyramid now," Hawass stated on his official Facebook page, according to Sabq. He emphasized that the Supreme Council of Antiquities has not granted any permits for work inside King Khafre's pyramid."No radar devices or modern technologies have been used to detect alleged structures beneath the Khafre Pyramid," pointed out Hawass, the former Minister of Antiquities, as reported by Asharq Al-Awsat. He described the claims as "an attempt to undermine ancient Egyptian civilization," adding that "these are failed attempts, and these rumors will go to the dustbin of history," according to Al Arabiya.The claims made by Malanga and Biondi “fall within the realm of exaggeration and deception," said Dr. Hussein Abdel-Basir, Director of the Antiquities Museum at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, according to Asharq Al-Awsat. He stressed that "any real scientific discovery in the field of archaeology must be published first in a reliable scientific journal after careful review by independent experts."Abdel-Basir pointed out that “geophysical techniques, such as Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) or seismic analysis, can scan limited depths, not exceeding tens of meters at best."The details they announced could not have been detected using such methods," remarked Hawass, according to Al-Ahram.

He acknowledged that while small structures such as shafts and chambers might exist beneath the pyramids, the idea of a vast underground city is questionable. "The Mayans and other people in ancient Mesoamerica often built pyramids on top of the entrances of caves or caverns that had ceremonial meaning to them," he explained, according to The Sun.

Greenland Prime Minister has taken aim at the Trump administration after finding out that a group of high-ranking officials will be arriving at the island before Second Lady Usha Vance's cordial visit.

On Sunday, the Trump administration propagated Vance's three-day trip to Greenland, announcing that she will be accompanied by her son from Thursday to Saturday to tour historical and cultural landmarks and witness the yearly dogsled race.

However, little was known about a visit led by national security advisor Mike Waltz that is supposedly planned for earlier this week.

Meanwhile, Mute B. Egede, the PM of Greenland, expressed his anger and indignation in a message to the local media after learning of the consecutive trips to the island.

“We are now at a level where it can in no way be characterized as a harmless visit from a politician's wife,” Egede asserted, as per Greenland's Sermitsiaq newspaper.

He went on to ask why the US national security adviser is in Greenland. According to him, the sole intent of his visit is to show off authority over Greenland amidst Trump's plans to take over it.

Calling him Trump's closest and most trusted advisor, the PM said that “his presence in Greenland alone will certainly make the Americans believe in Trump's mission, and the pressure will increase after the visit.”

Regarding the forthcoming travels of US officials in Greenland, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also released a statement.

“The visit from the United States cannot be seen in isolation from the public statements that have been made,” he said. “This is something we take seriously.”

Amidst his father's interest in buying the island, Trump Jr. visited Greenland in early January for a short visit.

Reflecting on his journey, he described it as a “incredible experience.” In a video shared on X, he claimed, “By the way, they love America here. They love America. They love Trump.”

The US is permitted to run military installations in Greenland, such as Ptiuffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Base, under a long-standing defense pact with Denmark.

After World War II, the United States made an offer to buy the island, but the Danish government turned it down.

According to both the Greenlandic and Danish governments, the region is not for sale.

United States head coach Mauricio Pochettino was in charge at Tottenham between 2014 and 2019 and has also managed Paris St-Germain and Chelsea

United States head coach Mauricio Pochettino had sections of his former club's fanbase giddy with excitement last week after he declared his desire to one day return to Tottenham.

It isn't a new concept, Pochettino has previously been clear in his wish to become Spurs head coach for a second period - but the current conjecture over incumbent Ange Postecoglou's future has sharpened the issue.

The Argentine remains a hero among some of the regulars at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Joining in 2014, Pochettino led the team to second and third placed finishes in the Premier League and a Champions League final.

Photos of Pochettino sharing a coffee with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, that went viral on social media last week, served only to amplify affections among supporters who pine for his return.

The fact the photos are not recent, certainly not taken over the past 10 days, won't quell the fervour.

Pochettino is under pressure in his current job. With a home World Cup in 2026 just 15 months away, his US side have lost consecutive Concacaf Nations League matches in the past week - beaten by Panama and Canada.

Yet, dig deeper and you realise the prospect of the 53-year-old returning to Spurs any time soon is hugely unlikely.

The United States Soccer Federation would be owed what has been described by a well-placed source as "one of the biggest financial compensation fees in football history" if Pochettino was to leave for Spurs - or any other team for that matter - before the next World Cup.

Chelsea's £21m payment to Brighton to land Graham Potter after sacking Thomas Tuchel in 2022 and Bayern Munich's £21m to RB Leipzig to pave the way for Julian Nagelsmann's appointment in 2021 are, according to reports, ranked as the two largest managerial compensation packages in history.

Pochettino signed a two-year contract in September, with multiple reports stating he earns £4.6m a year.

However, it is understood the sum US Soccer would recoup if Pochettino leaves before next year's tournament, which they are hosting along with Canada and Mexico, extends way beyond the his salary and much closer to the amount Chelsea and Bayern, respectively, paid to land Potter and Nagelsmann.

Would Pochettino return progress Spurs?

Pochettino's recent remarks appeared to swing the door open towards him replacing Postecoglou should the Australian lose his job before next season.

"I am in the USA, so I am not going to talk about that now - but what I said then I still, after six years or five years, feel in my heart," he said last week. "Yes, I would like one day to come back."

However, according to well-placed sources, Pochettino has no immediate wish to return to Spurs. He is said to be fully committed to leading the US to a home World Cup.

Of course, the mammoth cost of releasing Pochettino from his current deal lends itself to a singular focus, with the notion of any club - particularly one with a chairman as financially astute as Daniel Levy - parting with such a sizeable sum as being far-fetched.

Yet, you get the sense Pocehttino's desire to lead the US to the World Cup is genuine and not a mindset borne out of stipulations relating to his contract.

Indeed, during the same interviews in which he re-affirmed his intention to one day return to Tottenham, the South American spoke of his engagement with his new team and the project ahead.

"For us, the pressure is going to be there [at the World Cup] because we are a host," he said.

"And then it's a country where the mentality is about winning. In sport, in everything that Americans are involved in, they want to win.

"The players know it's going to be massive pressure and now our president [Trump] likes to put pressure on, but it's welcome. That means we are going to feel the adrenaline we need to feel. We are ready to deliver."

Tottenham Q&A: Does Postecoglou have a future at Spurs?

Much of the hype surrounding Pochettino's hypothetical return to Spurs stems from the fact Postecoglou is by no means certain of remaining in charge heading into next season.

Tottenham's disappointing season leaves him under scrutiny. They are in 14th place in the Premier League, having accumulated 34 points. Even if they win all their remaining nine matches, they would still fall short of last season's points total of 66.

Their wait for a domestic trophy will extend into next season after being eliminated from both cup competitions.

Postecoglou's only saving grace is Tottenham's run in the Europa League; they face Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals next month.

Of course, if Spurs win that competition the season takes on a very different complexion. Not only would success in Europe end the club's 17-year wait for silverware but it would also see them qualify for next season's Champions League.

Such a scenario would surely see Postecoglou strengthen his position.

That is easier said than done, of course. Indeed, failure to win the Europa League would raise further uncertainty over Postecoglou's job moving forward.

All current indications are that Tottenham want to get to the end of the season before reviewing the campaign and come to a decision.

Results, though, will likely dictate the club's approach.

Sunday's defeat by arch-rivals Canada has taken Pochettino's record as US head coach to five wins and three losses.

Prior to the current international break, Pochettino's win ratio since replacing Gregg Berhalter in September was healthier. But losing to Panama - 1-0 in the semi-final of the Concacaf Nations League - and 2-1 to Canada in the third-placed play-off, has led to some negativity.

Pochettino quickly moved to quell any disquiet after Sunday's defeat, saying: 'I've seen some times that teams that were building to play in the World Cup, they were not good until around the World Cup.

"I want to send a message to the fans, don't be pessimistic and don't get bad feelings.

"I think we have time because if we will be in this situation in one year time, for sure, I will tell you, 'Houston, we have a problem,' no?" Pochettino said.

"In one year, if we're talking about that, it's because we have a big problem and we were not capable to discover, to try design a better strategy to provide to the team the capacity to play in a different way. 

"I think we have time and I prefer that that happened today than [you] know, in one year."

Nevertheless, with around 15 months until the World Cup starts, this month's results will have fans apprehensive.

Ertharin Cousin, a former U.S. ambassador and an expert on world hunger, will speak on hunger and humanitarianism at Bridgewater College on Wednesday night.

During the endowed lecture, Cousin will talk about her work as well as the challenges of acute and chronic hunger.

Ertharin Cousin, former U.S. Ambassador, will speak at Bridgewater College on Wednesday night.

In 2009, Cousin was confirmed as the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Agencies for Food and Agriculture in Rome. In that role, she "helped identify and catalyze U.S. government investment in food security and nutrition activities supported by the USAID Feed the Future program," according to a press release from Bridgewater College.

From 2012 to 2017, Cousin was the executive director of the United Nations World Food Programme, which is the world's largest humanitarian organization. According to the organization's website, in 2023, the organization provided assistance to over 152 million people in over 120 countries.

Cousins has also served as Frank E. and Arthur W. Payne Distinguished Lecturer at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.

Before working to fight hunger globally, Cousins served as the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the nonprofit America's Second Harvest, which is now known as Feeding America. Before that, she was senior vice president for Albertsons, one of the largest food and drug retailers in the United States.

Cousins is a graduate of the University of the Illinois at Chicago, the University of Georgia Law School, and the University of Chicago's Executive Management Finance for Non-Financial Executives program.

The lecture, which is sponsored by the the Anna B. Mow Symposium on Comparative Religious Ethics and the Harry W. and Ina Mason Shank Peace Studies Endowment, will be Bridgewater College's fourth and last endowed lecture for the 2024-2025 school year. 

Ken Overway, an associate professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Bridgewater College and Director of Endowed Lectures at Bridgewater College, said that Cousin is addressing an important topic.

"Food insecurity is kind of one of those things that is all over the place, but often it pops up, and we don't realize how close to home it is," Overway said.

It even affects some college students, including local ones, Overway said.

"Food insecurity is just kind of a pervasive issue," he said. "Ambassador Cousin has deep experience in domestic and international food insecurity issues."

Overway said that Cousin takes a broad-spectrum approach to food insecurity.

"She has talked about all kinds of deep issues around food insecurity, not just bringing food to people but trying to be proactive about preventing food insecurity by promoting technology for farmers and political stability and prioritizing purchasing food from local farmers instead of from big producers where the money infusion could actually help the community," he said. 

He said that that Cousin will also talk about how food insecurity is related to humanitarianism "and just political instability in general, why, we, as a nation and we, as a people, may want to minimize food insecurity for our own national security."

Overway said that Cousin's talk will address many issues that should interest a broad audience.

"And I think, given the mix of people in the Valley, it, hopefully, is going to be interesting to not only just the students and community members on campus, but then the broader community," he said.

The event, which will be held at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday in Cole Hall, is free and open to the public.

        The UN predicts that as many as 3.5 million refugees and IDPs may return to their homes in Syria this year, and says more aid and funding is needed.
    

Syria is at a critical juncture as the country attempts to rebuild and reintegrate citizens returning to their homes amid a worsening humanitarian crisis, the UN has warned.

Since the ouster of former President Bashar al-Assad in December, about 1.2 million Syrians have gone home, including 885,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 302,000 refugees, according to the latest data from the UN Humanitarian Coordinator.

Half of Syrians returning from outside the country came from Lebanon, 22% from Türkiye and 13% from Iraq, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) says. More than a quarter of those who have returned to their places of origin are residing in damaged or unfinished buildings, according to the IOM.

The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) predicts that as many as 3.5 million refugees and IDPs may return home this year, with people hopeful of a fresh start after 14 years of civil war.

The regime of al-Assad had tried to market the idea of a "safe return" for refugees in recent years, but many of those who did come back under his rule were arrested or  forcibly conscripted into the army, while reconstruction of the country was very limited.

UN agencies and NGOs have warned of the challenges in reintegrating returnees, including a lack of basic services, security risks and missing legal documentation.

At least 7 million people remain displaced across the country, and severe economic challenges — from cash shortages to limited power — are hampering efforts to deliver aid, the UN said last week. 

As of mid-March, the $1.25 billion (€1.15bn) UN-coordinated humanitarian response for the country was only 12.5% funded, with vital sectors such as shelter, non-food relief, water and sanitation, and agriculture and nutrition suffering from lack of resources.

"The cost of inaction [...] is much more expensive than responding to the immediate needs of the Syrian people," the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Syria, Adam Abdelmoula, said in a briefing last week. 

Abdelmoula said that recent hostilities in northern, southern and coastal Syria had displaced thousands of people anew and created difficulties for aid delivery.

While there was relative stability after the toppling of al-Assad in early December by insurgent groups led by the Islamist Islamic Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, fresh violence broke out earlier this month between al-Assad loyalists from his Alawite minority ethnic group and government security forces.

More than 1,000 people died during several days of fighting, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group, which said the death toll from the clashes was one of the highest in the decade. 

Days after the violence that reopened the wounds of the civil war,** the interim government — led by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa — struck a deal with the Kurdish-led authority that controls the country's northeast. 

Al-Sharaa also signed a temporary constitution that leaves Syria under Islamist rule while promising to protect the rights of all Syrians for five years during a transitional phase.

Speaking at a donor conference in Brussels last week, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi urged greater global support and funding for displaced Syrians. 

He said that there must be shelter, electricity, water, sanitation, education, work for people who return to their communities, as well as respect for their rights.

"But if we fail to help them stay in Syria, make no mistakes: the impact will be disastrous. Not only returns will stop, but those who did return (and probably many others) will move again," Grandi told the conference.

Jaat trailer: The trailer of Gopichand Malineni's maiden Hindi film Jaat, starring Sunny Deol and Randeep Hooda in the lead roles, was released on Monday. The trailer shows Sunny's titular character threatening to bring down Randeep's ‘lanka' while saving the day. (Also Read: Jaat: Sunny Deol holds massive fan in bizarre first look of his next; internet jokes about being ‘blown away')

The almost 3-minute-long trailer sets up the world of Jaat. We're introduced to ‘Ranatunga ki Lanka' – a downtrodden place Randeep runs with everyone fearful to stand up to him. Numerous bodies are found buried in a field and Saiyami Kher's police officer is told Ranatunga is the reason for it. Regena Cassandrra's character says that even God is scared of entering the place.

But soon, Sunny's titular character steps up to save the day. It's hinted that he was once in prison for something, and Upendra Limaye describes him as an ‘atom bomb'. The trailer ends with him saying, “Ye dhai kilo ke haath ki taakat pura north dekh chuka hain. Ab south dekhega. (The north has already seen the power of this two-and-half-kilo arm. Now, the south will see it)”

Internet reactsReactions to the trailer ranged from people liking it to others wondering if the script was originally meant for Balakrishna. One person wrote on Reddit, “They had in the first half not gonna lie.” Another wrote, “Mass BGM, Dialogue Baazi, film looks like a winner. This is how to cut a trailer.” A Redditor wondered, “Looks like Balakrishna wasn't available, so director went with Sunny.” One person even thought that ‘Thaman cooked'. A person on X (formerly Twitter) compared it to Sikandar trailer, writing, “What We Expected From #SikandarTrailer Is Delivered By #JaatTrailer. This Trailer Is Just Mass, Mass & Mass.”

I wrote the script knowing it'll be perfect for someone like Sunny. It's not just about the mass elements my films usually have; it's going to be a racy script with a touch of realism. He's a big action hero, I'm a mass director, and we have the perfect script.” Jaat will be released in theatres on April 10 this year.

UK military officials have dismissed Prime Minister Keir Starmer's proposal for deploying Western troops to Ukraine as part of a ‘peacekeeping force' to oversee a potential ceasefire, The Telegraph reported on Sunday. Senior military sources told the outlet that Starmer had “got ahead of himself.”

Starmer announced the initiative earlier this month, aiming to build a “coalition of the willing” to support Ukraine militarily. Last week, he claimed that multiple countries backed the idea of sending in a peacekeeping force of up to 10,000 troops, despite Moscow's opposition to any Western deployments in the conflict zone.

London hosted planning talks last week with military officials from partner nations. However, military sources dismissed the plans as premature and politically motivated.

“There is no defined military end-state or military-strategic planning assumptions. It's all political theater,” one senior army official told the news outlet.

“Starmer got ahead of himself with talk of boots on the ground before he knew what he was talking about.”

The discussions have reportedly shifted their focus from boots on the ground to air and naval support. The Telegraph reported that RAF fighter jets could be deployed to patrol Ukrainian airspace, while British Typhoons could provide air cover for ground forces, though the size and role of any ground deployment remain unclear.

“It's politics. There's no military sense in it,” another defense source said, noting that neither Russia nor the US support the coalition. He also pointed to a lack of clarity on mission goals.

“What is a 10,000-international force based in the west of the country over 400km from the front line meant to do? It cannot even protect itself,” he argued. “What is the mission? What is its legitimacy? What are the rules of engagement? How is it commanded, supplied and housed? How long is it there for and why? No one knows.”

Further planning talks are expected in London on Monday between British and French defense officials. French President Emmanuel Macron is reportedly considering invoking the UN to authorize a European troop presence in Ukraine. However, Russia has repeatedly rejected the idea of Western peacekeepers in Ukraine, noting that it would require UN Security Council approval, where Moscow holds veto power.

The toll from Gaza's Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Experts say it is probably an undercount.

More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip, the enclave's Health Ministry said Sunday — a grim indicator of the conflict's continued lethality less than a week since Israel shattered a nearly two-month-old ceasefire, launching airstrikes and ground incursions into the territory.

Israel launched the war in Gaza in response to the deadly Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed about 1,200 people and took roughly 250 people hostage. Most of those hostages have been released through negotiated exchanges, and of the 59 Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza, 24 were believed to be alive before the conflict resumed.

Despite over a year of heavy bombardment of a strip of land of roughly 140 square miles, Israel has been unable to completely destroy Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007.

The two parties agreed to a ceasefire in January that paused hostilities and saw 33 Israeli hostages exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli detention. The first phase of what was supposed to be a three-phase path to a permanent end to the war lapsed on March 1, and the parties could not agree on an extension of that phase.

While Hamas wanted to immediately open talks for the second phase, in which Israel would fully withdraw from the enclave and Hamas would release remaining living hostages, Israel refused to engage in those talks and instead opted to extend the ceasefire.

Israel began bombing Gaza again Tuesday, breaking the fragile truce. The renewed Israeli attacks have killed more than 673 people since then, Gaza's Health Ministry said midday Sunday, more than a third of whom were children. An additional 233 people who were killed previously were added to the count of the dead after a committee tracking the missing confirmed their deaths, the Health Ministry added.

Many of the casualties over the past week have been women and children, according to medical workers and eyewitnesses.

In a joint statement on Sunday evening, the Israel Defense Forces and Shin Bet intelligence service said they had hit Gaza's Nasser Hospital in an airstrike, targeting a Hamas official who they said was operating in the hospital compound.

Israeli military and intelligence officials said the strike was carried out following “an extensive intelligence-gathering process.” Gaza's Health Ministry said the hospital attack caused a big fire, and a surgery building was targeted. Videos posted on social media by Palestinian media showed at least one level of the hospital aflame.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the hospital attack killed Ismail Barhoum, who he said was acting as prime minister in Gaza. Hamas confirmed  reports of Barhoum's death, saying he was receiving treatment at the hospital at the time. It was unclear what role, if any, Barhoum had in the group's military operations. Palestinian media reported that he was a member of Hamas's political bureau and head of the financial department in Rafah.

The Health Ministry said Sunday evening that at least two people were killed in the Nasser Hospital attack, including a 16-year-old boy who was recovering from surgery two days earlier. Medical staff were among the injured, and a large part of the surgical department was destroyed, it said.

Strikes last week targeted senior Hamas political figures, killing acting prime minister Essam al-Da'alis and high-ranking officials in the Hamas-run justice and interior ministries.

Among the 41 people killed between Saturday afternoon and late Sunday morning was senior Hamas leader Salah al-Bardawil, a member of the movement's political bureau, who was killed overnight, according to a statement from Hamas. The statement, which described the attack as an “assassination,” said Bardawil was killed alongside his wife when an Israeli airstrike hit his tent in Mawasi, an area of Khan Younis, as the couple were praying.

In a joint statement earlier Sunday, the IDF and Shin Bet  said they carried out the strike that killed Bardawil, describing him as the head of Hamas's “planning and development office.” It was unclear what role, if any, he had in the group's military operations.

Ibrahim Madhoun, a Palestinian political analyst who is close to Hamas, said Sunday that Bardawil was not involved in the activities of the group's military wing. He called Bardawil, who previously served as spokesman for the Hamas bloc in the Palestinian Legislative Council, a “symbol” within the movement and said his death was a “great loss.”

Also Sunday, the IDF said its troops had encircled the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood in Rafah in southern Gaza. “During the night, the troops encircled the area, eliminated several terrorists, and conducted a targeted raid on a terror infrastructure site that was used over the past few months as a command and control center of Hamas terrorists,” the statement said.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society said Sunday morning that it had lost contact with a team of paramedics trapped in Rafah and was “awaiting clearance” to try to reach the group. Gaza's civil defense force later said some of its crews were stuck in the same area after trying to rescue the Red Crescent staff and that they had also gone silent. Some 50,000 people living in the area encircled by Israeli troops faced “imminent danger” to their lives, the civil defense said.

The IDF said it was allowing civilians to evacuate, and an image Sunday showed families fleeing toward central Gaza, lugging babies, pillows and their few possessions by foot or  cart.

Sunday also marked three weeks since Israel blocked all aid from entering Gaza in an effort to force Hamas to compromise. The siege has reversed progress made during the ceasefire — which brought a surge of aid into Gaza — toward alleviating the dire humanitarian crisis there.

“Every day without food inches Gaza closer to an acute hunger crisis,” Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, wrote on X. “Banning aid is a collective punishment on Gaza: the vast majority of its population are children, women & ordinary men.”

Mediators have scrambled to drag the two sides back to the negotiating table, but current and former officials said the intensity of the renewed Israeli airstrikes has complicated their ability to revive a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

The Gazan Health Ministry's  figure of 50,021 killed since Oct. 7, 2023, does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but the ministry  says the majority of the dead are women and children. More than 113,000 people have been injured, according to the Health Ministry.

The Washington Post could not independently verify the ministry's figures; Israel has not allowed international journalists into Gaza since the start of the war. But Palestinian journalists, first responders, international aid workers and war-casualty watchdogs all say the official death toll in Gaza is probably an undercount, with the chaos of war upending what experts and researchers say was once a robust reporting system for tracking and identifying the dead.

During the nearly two-month ceasefire in Gaza, some people managed to recover the bodies of loved ones trapped beneath the rubble, but thousands more remain unaccounted for, according to Gaza's civil defense.

Alon Rom, Lior Soroka and Rachel Pannett contributed to this report.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that has been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.

Second lady Usha Vance will travel to Greenland this week, the White House announced Sunday, becoming the latest U.S. official to visit the Danish territory as Trump ramps up calls for U.S. ownership.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright and national security adviser Mike Waltz will join Vance, the vice president's wife, as part of the U.S. delegation, two administration sources confirmed to NBC News.

A man was arrested and charged with assault for driving his car toward a crowd of people protesting outside a Florida Tesla dealership and narrowly avoiding them, authorities said.

Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office said deputies went to a planned protest at a West Palm Beach dealership on Saturday, where suspect Andrew Dutil drove onto the curb and slowly toward the protesters. There were no injuries.

Trump announced to Truth Social that Alina Habba, who is serving as counselor to the president, will be the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey.

"Alina will lead with the same diligence and conviction that has defined her career, and she will fight tirelessly to secure a Legal System that is both 'Fair and Just' for the wonderful people of New Jersey," he said in the post.

The move is "effective immediately," Trump said. He said John Giordano, the current interim U.S. attorney in New Jersey, is being nominated as the ambassador to Namibia.

Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, a mild-mannered moderate, issued a fiery statement slamming Elon Musk and the Trump administration for recent actions curtailing the Social Security Administration, which include the removal of workers and office closures.

“The Trump Administration's callous indifference to the millions of Americans who rely on the monthly Social Security checks they have earned — and the millions more Americans who are relying on social security for their planned retirements — is the most direct assault on this vital program in its almost 100 year history. It is disrespectful, destructive, and dangerous,” King said.

“Social Security is not social media; this ‘move fast and break things' approach they seem to be following is a betrayal of the public trust,” King said in a statement. “The President has said repeatedly, during the campaign and since, that he would protect social security — but what's happening now in his name is anything but protection, and he should put a stop to it.”

Musk's actions on Social Security have sparked an elevated level of concern among Republicans, who have looked the other way on various other “DOGE” activities. It's particularly salient in King's home state of Maine, where the agency initially issued — then rescinded — an order that would make it harder for parents to register newborns for Social Security numbers at hospitals.

King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, added: “When the Trump White House and its corporate-suite cabinet sends reckless DOGE computer engineers into the Social Security networks, threaten cuts to the committed workforce who carefully manage this system, make it harder for citizens to interact with that workforce, or scoff at older Americans justifiably worried about late payments — as one of his billionaire cabinet members did just this week — this dismissive public stance frightens the very people who literally built this country, and who deserve a hell of a lot better.'

Trump will gather his Cabinet secretaries for a third known meeting Monday morning with Elon Musk expected to attend, according to a senior administration official. 

The official described the 11 a.m. gathering as a “follow-up on the last DOGE meeting,” in reference to a meeting on March 6 where Trump placed limits on the billionaire tycoon's authority amid backlash to new cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency.

A majority of American voters say their sympathies lie more with Ukraine than Russia in the war between the two countries. At the same time, nearly half say they think Trump favors Russia, while most of the remainder believe he favors neither, according to the new national NBC News poll.

Sixty-one percent of registered voters choose Ukraine when asked which of the two countries has their sympathies more, while just 2% say Russia. Another 35% say they are more sympathetic to neither side, while 2% are not sure.

A new memo from Trump that authorized the attorney general and the homeland security secretary to sanction law firms that file lawsuits they deem “frivolous” is a major escalation of his intensifying assault on law firms, legal experts and former Justice Department officials told NBC News.

A federal appeals court panel of three judges will hear arguments today over the Trump administration's deportation of five Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act. 

The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia will listen to arguments by both sides on the government's request to reverse U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's temporary restraining order, which effectively blocked the administration from deporting more people under the rarely used wartime law.

The arguments will take place at 1:30 p.m., and each side will be allotted 30 minutes to make their case. 

Trump continued attacks on Boasberg over the weekend, calling him a "constitutional disaster" in a post to his Truth Social platform yesterday.

SALT LAKE CITY — Former U.S. Rep. Mia Love of Utah, a daughter of Haitian immigrants who became the first Black Republican woman elected to Congress, died Sunday.

She was 49.

Love's family posted news of her death on Love's X account.

She had undergone recent treatment for brain cancer and received immunotherapy as part of a clinical trial at Duke University's brain tumor center. Her daughter said earlier this month that the former lawmaker was no longer responding to treatment.

The Republican-led Congress returns today after a weeklong recess with plans to shift focus to the party-line bill to pass Trump's multitrillion-dollar agenda after having dispensed with a separate government funding deadline.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has set a target of passing the legislation through the House in April before the Easter recess, which leaves Republicans in the House with three weeks — and a lot of work. And then the bill would go to the Senate, which has a different idea of how to proceed.

Yesterday, Ukrainian and U.S. delegations discussed proposals to protect energy facilities and critical infrastructure, Ukraine's defense minister said, part of a diplomatic push by Trump to end three years of war.

The meeting in Saudi Arabia, which preceded talks today between the U.S. and Russian delegations, came as U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff expressed optimism about the chances for ending Europe's deadliest conflict since World War Two.

“I feel that [Russian President Vladimir Putin] wants peace,” Witkoff told Fox News yesterday.

The NAACP and the National Education Association, along with other groups, announced this morning that they are suing the Trump administration over its efforts to dismantle the Department of Education.

"Eliminating or effectively shuttering the Department puts at risk the millions of vulnerable students, including those from low-income families, English learners, homeless students, rural students and others who depend on Department support," the groups said in a press release. 

The groups said that the lawsuit urges the court to "immediately halt the government's attempt to dismantle the Department."

Trump signed an executive order on Thursday directing the Education Secretary to start dismantling the department. Eliminating the department entirely requires an act of Congress.

Washington, D.C.'s iconic cherry blossoms are getting closer to the 2025 peak bloom. Thousands of trees with white and pink flowers circle the Tidal Basin and parks near some of the capital's famous monuments and memorials.

Here's what to know about when and where to see the cherry trees in bloom.

Peak bloom occurs when 70% of the blossoms of the Yoshino cherry trees, the most common type along the Tidal Basin, are open. The National Park Service, which tracks the blooming of the trees each year, predicts peak bloom will be between March 28 and 31 this year.

Based on over 100 years of data, the average peak bloom date is April 3, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The timing of peak bloom varies each year, largely due to temperatures, with warmer temperatures leading to earlier peak blooms. 

Since 1921, when the National Park Service began recording the dates, peak blooms have shifted earlier by about eight days, the EPA says.

As of March 23, 70% of the Yoshino cherry trees around the Tidal Basin reached the fifth stage in their blooming, which is puffy blossoms, according to the National Park Service. The next stage is peak bloom.

A live camera provided by the Trust for the National Mall offers viewers a chance to check the status of some of the blossoms.

The most famous place to see the cherry blossoms in the nation's capital is around the Tidal Basin in West Potomac Park. Many cherry trees are also along a section of the Potomac River and Washington Channel in East Potomac Park.

This year, construction that began in August 2024 to replace seawalls along the Potomac River and part of the Tidal Basin could affect the viewing of some of the cherry trees. The work is expected to last through 2026.

However, there are many other cherry trees throughout Washington, D.C. Casey Trees, a nonprofit that plants and cares for trees in the city, provides a map of where to see the blossoms across Washington. The map does not include trees on private property, the organization said.

The Yoshino cherry trees usually bloom for several days, the National Park Service said, but weather conditions will affect the length of time. 

"Cool, calm weather can extend the length of the bloom, and a rainy, windy day can bring an abrupt end to the ephemeral blossoms," the agency said on its website. "A late frost can prevent the trees from blooming at all."

Japan gifted more than 3,000 cherry trees to the United States in 1912 as a symbol of friendship.

That year, first lady Helen Herron Taft and the wife of the Japanese ambassador, Viscountess Chinda Iwa, planted two of the Yoshino cherry trees along the Tidal Basin, the National Park Service notes in a history of the trees. In the next few years, the trees continued to be planted around the basin and other areas.

But the idea to plant Japanese cherry trees in the U.S. capital was raised as early as 1885 by a woman named Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, a writer and diplomat, according to the National Park Service. 

Despite her first request to the U.S. Army Superintendent of the Office of Public Buildings and Grounds not going anywhere, she continued to ask and eventually wrote to Herron Taft, who helped bring the idea to life, the agency says.

Second lady Usha Vance will visit Greenland later this week, the White House announced Sunday, while national security adviser Mike Waltz will visit in a separate trip this week as the Trump administration continues to eye Greenland. 

Waltz will visit the Pituffik Space Base, ta source familiar with the plans told CBS News on Sunday.

White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said Monday that the U.S. has a "vested interested in the Arctic region." 

"We also look forward to experiencing Greenland's famous hospitality and are confident that this visit presents an opportunity to build on partnerships that respects Greenland's self-determination and advances economic cooperation," Hughes said. "This is a visit to learn about Greenland, its culture, history, and people and to attend a dogsled race the United States is proud to sponsor, plain and simple." 

The plans were criticized Monday by Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede, who said Washington was interfering in Greenland's internal affairs, according to the French news agency AFP.

"It should be said clearly that our integrity and democracy must be respected without foreign interference," AFP quoted Egede as saying, adding that it "cannot be seen as just a private visit."

The second lady has already made a number of overseas trips, having visited Paris in February and India earlier this month. 

According to the White House, Vance will visit "historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race." She is set to arrive on Thursday and return on Saturday. 

Her son will join her on the trip, the White House said, along with a U.S. delegation. 

President Trump first expressed interest in taking control of Greenland, which is currently a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, during his first administration. He has ramped up the effort since taking office two months ago. In his first speech before a joint session of Congress of his second term, Mr. Trump vowed that "we're going to get it."

"We need Greenland for national security and even international security," the president said during his address on March 4. "I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it."

Egede responded at the time, saying "We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken."

Egede said Mr. Trump was, "very unpredictable, in such a way that people feel insecure." In an election that was held on March 11 — after Mr. Trump's speech  — Egede's opposition won, although the party still needs to form a coalition government.

"Greenland needs us to stand together in a time of great interest from outside," Democratic party leader Jens-Frederik Nielsen told local media, according to BBC News. "There is a need for unity, so we will enter into negotiations with everyone."

Waltz said in January that the talks about Greenland are "not just about Greenland, this is about the Arctic."

"You have Russia that is trying to become king of the Arctic with 60 plus icebreakers, some of them nuclear powered," Waltz said in January. "You know how many we have? We have two and one just caught on fire. This is about critical minerals. This is about natural resources." 

Mr. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., visited in January before the president took office. Ahead of his visit, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said that Greenland is not for sale, but she said she would continue to welcome American interest and investment.

U.S. negotiators worked to hammer out details of a proposed partial ceasefire in Ukraine on Monday, meeting with representatives from Russia a day after holding separate talks with the Ukrainian team. Each side has accused the other of undermining efforts to reach a pause in the 3-year-old war.

Kyiv and Moscow agreed in principle Wednesday to a limited ceasefire after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders, but the parties have offered different views of what targets would be off-limits to attack.

While the White House said “energy and infrastructure” would be covered, the Kremlin declared that the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he would also like to see railways and ports protected.

Talks Monday are expected to address some of those differences, as well as a potential pause in attacks in the Black Sea to ensure the safety of commercial shipping.

U.S. and Russian representatives began meeting in the morning in the Saudi capital, Russia's state Tass and RIA-Novosti news agencies reported. The U.S. and Ukrainian teams met on Sunday in Riyadh, and more contacts were expected, though it was not clear when.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday the Russian military is fulfilling President Vladimir Putin's order to halt attacks on energy facilities for 30 days.

Peskov accused Ukraine of derailing the partial ceasefire with an attack on a gas metering station in Sudzha in Russia's Kursk region. Ukraine's military General Staff rejected Moscow's accusations and blamed the Russian military for shelling the station, a claim Peskov called “absurd.”

Meanwhile, Russian troops launched a new barrage of drones, including decoys, into Ukraine overnight into Monday, according to Ukraine's air force, causing some damage and injuries.

Before the latest attack, Zelenskyy said in a televised statement Sunday evening that “since March 11, a proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table, and these attacks could have already stopped. But it is Russia that continues all this.”

He added that Ukraine's partners — “the U.S., Europe, and others around the world” — should step up pressure on Russia “to stop this terror.”

Zelenskyy has emphasized that Ukraine is open to a full, 30-day ceasefire that Trump has proposed. But Putin has made a complete ceasefire conditional on a halt of arms supplies to Kyiv and a suspension of Ukraine's military mobilization — demands rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies.

Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said he expected “some real progress” at the talks in Saudi Arabia, and that a pause in hostilities between both countries in the Black Sea would “naturally gravitate into a full-on shooting ceasefire.”

Serhii Leshchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidency, said the delegation remained in Riyadh on Monday and expected to meet again with the Americans.

Asked about reports speculating that China might send peacekeepers to Ukraine to enforce any future peace deal, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun responded Monday with an unequivocal no.

“Let me stress that the report is completely false. China's position on the Ukraine crisis is clear and consistent,” Guo said at a daily briefing.

China has provided Russia with trade earnings from oil and other natural resources, along with diplomatic backing, but has not given any weapons or sent any personnel. China is, however, on close terms with North Korea, which has sent troops to fight alongside the Russian army.

A “massive targeted cyberattack” hit Ukrainian state railway operator Ukrzaliznytsia on Sunday, the company wrote on Telegram, adding that the restoration of its systems was ongoing as of Monday morning.

The company said the attack did not affect train movements or schedules, but that the online booking system was currently unavailable.

“The railway continues to operate despite physical attacks on the infrastructure, and even the most vile cyberattacks cannot stop it,” the company wrote.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's Special Operations Forces claimed to have destroyed four military helicopters in Russia's Belgorod region with the use of American-supplied HIMARS rocket systems.

The special forces published drone footage of what they said was the attack on their Telegram page on Monday.

The group wrote that the strikes had occurred at a concealed “jumping-off point” for Russian aircraft used in surprise attacks on Ukrainian forces.

Russian troops, meanwhile, fired 99 attack and decoy drones into Ukraine overnight Sunday, according to Ukraine's air force, of which 57 were shot down and 36 were lost from radar.

In the Kyiv region, one man suffered injuries overnight as a Russian drone struck a residential area.

“The man has superficial shrapnel wounds to his abdomen, chest, thighs, and head,” the acting head of the Kyiv region, Mykola Kalashnyk, wrote on Telegram on Monday.

In the Kharkiv region, a Russian drone struck a residential building in the village of Velyka Babka, injuring a 25-year-old man and a pregnant woman. Both were hospitalized, regional head Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram on Monday morning.

In Zaporizhzhia, Russian drones damaged several houses of local residents overnight with one elderly woman suffering light injuries, regional head Ivan Fedorov wrote on Telegram.

The #MeToo movement hit critical mass in 2017, toppling politicians and public figures across the country. Allegations of harassment and misconduct — some from many years prior — emerged. Many state legislatures responded by adopting or enhancing policies against sexual misconduct.

In the years since, women's representation in U.S. statehouses has reached an all-time high.

As more women fill seats and hold leadership positions, lawmakers and others are divided about whether anything has changed. But allegations continue to surface — at the state level and beyond.

The Associated Press tallied allegations against state lawmakers across the country, examined the sexual harassment policies of legislative chambers in all 50 states, and talked to lawmakers, lobbyists and staff.

Here are key takeaways from the investigation:

Since 2017, The Associated Press has cataloged at least 147 state lawmakers across 44 states who have been accused of sexual harassment or misconduct. Most allegations were reported during the first two years of #MeToo, but more have surfaced every year since.

The total includes allegations of incidents both in state government and outside of it.

In 2024 alone, the AP tallied at least 14 state lawmakers from 12 states who were accused — about twice as many as the previous year.

In total, over a third of accused lawmakers resigned or were expelled from office. Roughly another third faced repercussions like losing party or committee positions. A dozen top state executive officials, including governors and attorneys general, faced similar allegations during that time and most resigned.

According to the National Women's Defense League, which advocates for sexual harassment policies in statehouses and keeps its own count, Republicans and Democrats are nearly equally accused and 94% of those overall are men.

An AP survey, conducted from last November through January, found nearly half of all legislative chambers had updated their sexual harassment policies over the past five years. However, many policies are difficult for the general public to locate.

Near the beginning of #MeToo, an AP survey found about a third of legislative chambers didn't require lawmakers to take sexual harassment training.

Almost all state legislatures now offer it, though it's not always mandatory and content, format and frequency vary. Only about one-third of legislative chambers conduct training annually, according to AP's survey.

The Arkansas Senate is the only legislative chamber without a specific sexual harassment policy. Officials in the Oklahoma Senate, the Mississippi Senate and both chambers of the West Virginia Legislature did not provide their sexual harassment policies to the AP.

Lawmakers and others are divided about whether anything has changed.

Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, who filed a sexual harassment complaint against a fellow lawmaker in 2020, said any improvements have less to do with “policy changes or work groups,” and more to do with “just the fact that we have significantly more women in charge.”

Others still see sexism.

“Sometimes it feels like we should just smile more and not be disruptive and not challenge anyone. That hasn't gone away,” said Georgia state Rep. Shea Roberts, who resigned as Democratic Caucus treasurer to protest a fellow lawmaker who was accused last year of sexually harassing a staffer.

Advocates and lawmakers say the statehouse environment can still be hostile enough to keep many women from running for office.

“When men run for office, it's about whether they can do the job,” said Erin Maye Quade, a Minnesota senator. “When women run for office, it's about a lot more than that.”

Men still make up two-thirds of all state lawmakers in the U.S., and some say #MeToo gave them space to join the discussion and to acknowledge more work is needed.

Republican state Rep. Mark Schreiber of Kansas said attitudes have evolved over the years — from a “boys will be boys” ethos to acknowledging the harassment, while still blaming women. In more recent years, he said, men realized, “We're blaming the wrong people.”

          / CBS New York
        

Sunday was opening night on Broadway for two of Hollywood's biggest stars.

Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal are taking on the new production of Shakespeare's "Othello."

The red carpet was full of VIPs, including Jennifer Lopez, Samuel L. Jackson, Anna Wintour, Colman Domingo and many more. And entertainers weren't the only ones in attendance. Former President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, were also seen entering the Barrymore Theatre.

Washington plays the conflicted and murderous title character. His jealousy and violence is carefully orchestrated by his backstabbing confidante Iago, played by Gyllenhaal.

Prior to the show, members of the cast explained how horrors and thrills created by Shakespeare now land with a freshness in a modern setting.

"They've treated this like a new play," said Andrew Burnap, who plays "Cassio."

"I'm excited to share," said Kimber Elayne Sprawl, who portrays "Emilia."

"Even if you know it, seeing it happen right in front of you, the conflict that happens in the play, it's just so human that it will always need to tell the story," said Molly Osborne, who plays "Desdemona."

Othello's director is Tony Award winner Kenny Leon.

"Denzel is an emperor. He's an emperor of the American stage, of the world stage. He has met this role head on and Jake has met Denzel head on," Leon said.

In February, while Othello was in rehearsals, CBS News New York sat down with Washington and Gyllenhaal. Both described their roles as exciting, and for each star a dream come true.

"We are given the freedom to break the rules," Washington said.

"I spent the past eight months really digging in because I've never done Shakespeare," Gyllenhaal added.

Producer Brian Moreland said a sizzling Shakespeare is what they were after and he credits the unbeatable cast and creators.

"It's that good and they're that good. Night after night they build that same journey, so that you get to the point that we all know is going to happen, it's all inevitable, but yet you're there with them on every single word they have to say," Moreland said.

To call Othello, which runs through June 8, a financial hit is an understatement as it is expected to earn the title of highest grossing Broadway play ever.

Former U.S. Rep. Mia Love of Utah, a daughter of Haitian immigrants who became the first Black Republican woman elected to Congress, died on Sunday

SALT LAKE CITY -- Former U.S. Rep. Mia Love of Utah, a daughter of Haitian immigrants who became the first Black Republican woman elected to Congress, died Sunday.

She was 49. 

Love's family posted news of her death on Love's X account.

She had undergone recent treatment for brain cancer and received immunotherapy as part of a clinical trial at Duke University's brain tumor center. Her daughter said earlier this month that the former lawmaker was no longer responding to treatment.

Love died at her home in Saratoga Springs, Utah, according to a statement posted by the family.

“With grateful hearts filled to overflowing for the profound influence of Mia on our lives, we want you to know that she passed away peacefully,” her family said. “We are thankful for the many good wishes, prayers and condolences."

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox referred to Love as a “true friend.”

“Her legacy of service inspired all who knew her,” Cox said in a statement. “We pray for her family and mourn with them.”

Love entered politics in 2003 after winning a seat on the city council in Saratoga Springs, a growing community about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City. She later became the city's mayor.

In 2012, Love narrowly lost a bid for the House against the Democratic incumbent, former Rep. Jim Matheson, in a district that covers a string of Salt Lake City suburbs.

She ran again two years later and defeated first-time candidate Doug Owens by about 7,500 votes.

Love didn't emphasize her race during her campaigns, but she acknowledged the significance of her election after her 2014 victory. She said her win defied naysayers who had suggested that a Black, Republican, Mormon woman couldn't win a congressional seat in overwhelmingly white Utah.

She was briefly considered a rising star within the GOP and she kept her distance from Donald Trump, who was unpopular with many Utah voters, while he was running for president ahead of the 2016 election.

In 2016, facing reelection and following the release of a 2005 recording in which Trump made lewd comments about groping women, Love skipped the Republican National Convention and released a statement saying definitively that she would not vote for Trump. She instead endorsed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the GOP race, but he dropped out months later.

While seeking a third term in 2018, Love tried to separate herself Trump on trade and immigration while still backing her party's positions on tax cuts. Despite Republican voters outnumbering Democrats by a nearly three-to-one margin in her district, though, she lost by fewer than 700 votes to former Salt Lake City Mayor Ben McAdams, a Democrat.

Trump called out Love by name in a news conference the morning after she lost, where he also bashed other Republicans who didn't fully embrace him.

“Mia Love gave me no love, and she lost,” Trump said. “Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.”

After her loss, Love served as a political commentator on CNN and as a fellow at the University of Sydney.

Following Trump's election in November, Love said she was “OK with the outcome.”

“Yes, Trump says a lot of inconsiderate things that are unfortunate and impossible to defend. However, his policies have a high probability of benefiting all Americans,” Love wrote in a social media post.

Second lady Usha Vance will travel to Greenland this week, the White House announced Sunday, becoming the latest U.S. official to visit the Danish territory as President Donald Trump ramps up calls for U.S. ownership.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright and national security adviser Mike Waltz will join Vance, the vice president's wife, as part of the U.S. delegation, two administration sources confirmed to NBC News.

Vance, who is taking one of her two sons, will visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage and attend a national dogsled race, the White House said. The trip will begin Thursday.

The officials will embark on the trip as Trump sharpens his yearslong proposal to take over Greenland, a mineral-rich island that houses a U.S. military base in a region of growing geopolitical importance.

Vance said in a video Sunday that her visit will double as an effort to celebrate and strengthen "the long history of mutual respect and cooperation between" the United States and Greenland.

The New York Times first reported Vance's trip.

The U.S. delegation's visit has drawn the ire of outgoing Greenlandic Prime Minister Múte B. Egede, who questioned whether the trip was a show of force meant to intimidate local leaders.

"We are now at a level where it can in no way be characterized as a harmless visit from a politician's wife," Egede told the national newspaper Sermitsiaq on Sunday. "What is the security adviser doing in Greenland? The only purpose is to show a demonstration of power to us, and the signal is not to be misunderstood."

Representatives for the White House and the Energy Department did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Trump floated the idea of purchasing Greenland during his first term in office but has recently grown more aggressive in making the pitch. He has called ownership of Greenland "an absolute necessity" and has refused to rule out using military force to acquire it.

“We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're going to get it,” Trump said in his address to a joint session of Congress this month.

He offered a similar rationale during an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte this month, when he suggested the military alliance may have to aid his effort to annex the territory.

"We have a lot of our favorite players cruising around the coast, and we have to be careful," Trump said. "I think that's why NATO might be, have to get involved in a way, because we really need Greenland for national security.”

Greenland is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, which is a member of NATO.

Greenlandic and Danish leaders have consistently rejected Trump's proposal.

In January, Donald Trump Jr., accompanied by right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk, traveled to Greenland for a visit his father characterized as being in support of a "deal that must happen."

            For more than a month, President Donald Trump and his administration have been promoting April 2 as a kind of tariffs Super Bowl, during which all of his many promised import taxes will go into effect. But as he has demonstrated many times before, Trump once again appears to be offering a lot of hype and little action.
    


            Trump administration officials are trying to tamp down expectations that every pledged tariff action will go into effect April 2, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported this weekend. Instead, a significantly reduced batch of tariffs will be announced next week, and more could follow later, although both reports said the situation remains fluid and the ultimate decision could change.
    


            US stocks were higher Monday on the reports, as investors were relieved that the most punishing tariffs may not be coming as soon as many on Wall Street had feared. The Dow was up 530 points, or 1.27%. The broader S&P 500 rose 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2%.
    


            The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.32% as investors sold bonds in favor of riskier assets like stocks, reflecting easing concerns about the impact of Trump's tariffs. Yields and prices move in opposite directions.
    


            Wall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, slid 4.4% to its lowest level this month.
    


            Trump has repeatedly proclaimed next Wednesday to be “Liberation Day,” bringing massive reciprocal tariffs that match foreign countries' import taxes dollar for dollar. He was also set to enact twice-delayed 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada after briefly allowing them to go into effect earlier this month. And Trump had promised tariffs on a wide variety of goods imported from anywhere, including autos, pharmaceuticals, microchips, copper, lumber and other products.
    


            Now, it seems, those product-specific tariffs will not be enacted April 2, according to the Journal and Bloomberg. As for the 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods, it's unclear whether they will take effect or be further postponed.
    


            A White House official told CNN that no final decision have been made, and tariffs on various sectors and industries may or may not be announced April 2.
    


            Reciprocal tariffs will go into effect – perhaps as soon as April – but they will be limited to a dozen or so countries, Bloomberg and the Journal reported. The countries that first face the reciprocal tariffs will perhaps be the 15% of nations that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking on Fox Business last week, labeled “the Dirty 15” – countries that he says persistently treat the United States unfairly in their trading practices. Those trading partners could include Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia and Vietnam, according to the Journal.
    


            Although tariffs on those partners could cover the majority of goods coming into the United States, the more targeted approach nevertheless represents a significant pullback from some of the harshest tariffs Trump had promised.
    


            The administration has been setting the stage for a walkback for days. Trump in the Oval Office Friday hinted that his administration would allow for “flexibility” on tariffs – the first sign of potential exemptions after he had pledged there would be none.
    


            Trump still said he was hesitant to issue carve-outs on tariffs, but he has acknowledged in the past that tariffs enacted with a sledge hammer instead of a scalpel can at times inflict undue harm on Americans and US interests.
    


            “I don't change. But the word ‘flexibility' is an important word,” Trump said Friday. “So there'll be flexibility, but basically it's reciprocal,” he added, noting most tariffs will simply match foreign countries' taxes dollar for dollar with no carve-outs.
    


            Meanwhile, negotiations are ongoing. The EU last Thursday postponed its retaliatory tariffs, which were set to go into effect April 1, as talks continue. Mexico and Canada delayed plans to retaliate against US tariffs as officials negotiate.
    


            But Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs are giving investors, businesses, trading partners and consumers a serious dose of whiplash.
    


            We've been here before.
    


            Trump campaigned on steep tariffs on Day One, but he failed to deliver on that promise. Instead, he signed several executive actions on his first day in office ordering his administration to investigate whether to pursue tariffs on a wide range of goods. He did, however, announce that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico would be coming February 1.
    


            February 1 came, and, rather than the promised tariffs, Trump said the tariffs would come February 4. Then, on the eve of their taking effect, Trump announced monthlong delays on Canadian and Mexican tariffs after both countries sent delegations to negotiate, offering minor increases to existing border security and promises to take more action to restrict fentanyl crossing into the United States.
    


            Tariffs on China went into place February 4 – but not at the 60% level Trump had promised in December. The 10% tariffs came with a surprising twist: The elimination of the de minimis exclusion, a loophole that allows goods valued at less than $800 to come over the border duty-free. Those packages are numerous and onerous for customs officials to scan for tariffs.
    


            The next day, the US Postal Service stopped all package deliveries from China from entering the United States because it was unable to abide by the new trade policy. But hours later, the de minimis exclusion was back on – temporarily – until the Commerce Department could determine how to police it.
    


            Then, Trump promised a “big one,” as he called it: reciprocal tariffs.
    


            Instead, the plan, as it were, which Trump announced in the Oval Office on February 13 to much fanfare, consisted of a vaguely worded memo that offered few concrete details. Stocks surged that day as investors celebrated a tariff policy that appeared to be a lot of bark with no bite.
    


            On March 3, the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico went into effect – for three days. On March 6, Trump delayed all tariffs on its neighboring countries that comply with the USMCA trade agreement.
    


            On March 11, Trump threatened a 50% tariff on Canada's aluminum and steel but backed off the same day after Ontario agreed to suspend its 25% surcharge on electricity exports to Michigan, Minnesota and New York. The president has also threatened tariffs of up to 250% on Canadian dairy, reciprocal tariffs on Canadian lumber and 200% tariffs on European alcohol. It's unclear what the status of those threats is.
    


            Trump implemented tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum March 12, although they didn't represent a significant increase over what was already in place.
    


            The back and forth has created volatility on Wall Street, confusion for consumers and massive amounts of uncertainty for businesses, who are paralyzed by their inability to plan for what's next.

Tesla stock (TSLA) led gains among the "Magnificent Seven" on Monday, surging as much as 10% amid investor optimism that President Donald Trump's tariff plans may not be as wide-reaching as previously anticipated.

Read more about Tesla's stock moves and today's market action.

Reports that Trump will hold off on bringing in levies on the auto sector on April 2 eased worries that Tesla's bottom line would be impacted.

Shares of the EV maker had already been on a downward trend amid concerns of a drop in sales and a backlash against the brand over CEO Elon Musk's involvement in politics.

The stock began digging out of its most recent dip last week when Tesla revealed plans to launch its robotaxi service in 2025.

On Monday, the electric car maker responded to complaints about a pause in its Full Self-Driving trial in China, saying it will release the features once regulatory approval is secured.

Last Thursday, CEO Elon Musk held an impromptu company all-hands, giving an update on the progress of a number of products while also attempting to assuage fears that he wasn't ignoring his post.

The electric vehicle manufacturer's sales have slipped recently in key regions like Europe, China, and even the US.

As Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian recently reported, not only has the changeover to the new Model Y SUV been seen as a drag on sales, but Musk's closeness to President Trump and embrace of right-wing politics may be also impacting the brand.

Struggling chip giant Intel (INTC) could have a shot at future glory days.

But it's not guaranteed, and it won't be for a while, one analyst said.

"I think Intel has a much better shot of remaining viable in this industry [under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan]," Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen below). "It's not going to be easy — competition is not sitting still. Their competition, remember, is Nvidia. It's AMD. It's Arm Holdings. It's a Taiwan Semiconductor. It is Broadcom. It's Marvell."

Intel announced Tan as its next CEO on March 12. He officially began last week.

Tan was the CEO of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) from 2009 to 2021. After serving on Intel's board for two years, he left in August 2024 following clashes with now-ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger on how to position the business, a source told me.

The source said Tan was interviewed for the CEO role of Intel at the same time as Gelsinger. Gelsinger ultimately got the gig in 2021 but had to play nice by agreeing to put Tan on the board. Tan frequently pushed for a better artificial intelligence strategy to take on Nvidia (NVDA) and faster decision making at the notoriously bureaucratic Intel.

Listen: What Bill Gates thinks about Intel

The tech industry veteran has numerous challenges on his hands at the iconic American tech player.

Gelsinger led aggressive efforts to turn around the troubled US chipmaker for more than three years. He slashed thousands of jobs, improved costs, secured CHIPS Act funding, built chip foundries, and promised fast AI chips that could compete with Nvidia and AMD (AMD).

He was fired in early December amid missed targets and a cash drain on the foundry business.

Intel's fourth quarter sales fell 7% year over year to $14.3 billion, and net earnings plunged 76%. The company forecasts it will only break even on the profit line this year.

Tan must stabilize the business, likely through more cost cuts and new leadership, and regain trust with Wall Street.

 

Arya thinks Tan could look for partners to fund the expensive production of chips, a potential cash-saving strategy some on the Street have pushed Intel to consider. He upgraded his rating on Intel's stock to Neutral following Tan's appointment.

The stock is too cheap based on Intel's intellectual property, Arya added.

"So all we are saying is that the only value on Intel [right now] is just right the bricks and mortar of its fabs, right? Which is obviously not the case," Arya explained. "Now, should it really be valued as one of these growth companies? Obviously not. So I think what we were trying to say is that under his leadership, Intel has a better chance of adding [value] ... and getting recognized for its IP value because [Tan] comes from that background."

Oops, something went wrong

Tech stocks were leading the US stock market rally on Monday, with headlines on more targeted tariff plans from President Trump and a new AI breakthrough from Jack Ma's Ant Group helping boost the sector to start the week.

Shares of Meta (META) and AMD (AMD) were each up better than 3% in early trade while Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 2.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up 1.5% shortly after the market open.

Monday's broad market rally followed reports late Sunday that Trump would narrow the number of US trading partners subject to reciprocal tariffs on April 2. The administration is also reportedly set to limit some industry-specific tariffs that were set to take effect, including those on cars and chips.

In the tech world, news early Monday out of China that Ant Group, the Jack Ma-backed tech conglomerate, has trained cheaper AI models using Chinese-made chips and those from AMD was the latest sign the AI race continues to push new boundaries.

Speaking last week at its GTC Conference, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the introduction of lower-cost models — like those most notably put forth by China's DeepSeek — shows the computing needs for AI are actually higher than previously thought. Nvidia's chips are also subject to an export ban from the US in China.

Earlier this year, Nvidia stock fell over 16% in a single day after DeepSeek's R1 model matched the performance of higher-cost AI models like those from OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) at a fraction of the cost.

In the weeks since these developments, the industry has seen similar breakthroughs in the same vein as that vocalized by Huang. These reflect the larger-than-imagined potential of even deeper AI investments rather than exposing the limits of current plans. (See also: Jevons Paradox.)

Also in tech news, a South Korean AI chip startup FuriosaAI reportedly rejected an $800 million offer from Meta. This takes a potential headache away from Meta shareholders, who might have to price in regulatory overhangs and integration costs, and shows AI startups have plenty of confidence to explore the market independently.

Tech-specific developments, though a boost for the AI trade on the margins, still take a back seat to trade news. And though AI may not be the clearest fundamental winner or loser due to Trump's tariffs, tech's central role in the stock market rally since late 2022 has seen these stocks retain their leadership position on the way up and the way down.

As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer noted over the weekend, last week's reaction to the Federal Reserve's latest announcement made clear tariffs are — and will be — the key catalyst for markets in the coming weeks.

Fears about the health of the US economy, the outlook for corporate profits, and the direction of Fed policy have all taken a turn leading the daily market discussion during the S&P 500's swift 10% pullback from its Feb. 19 record close.

But tariffs have become the clear catalyst in shaping investor sentiment and the market's daily direction.

First, in their absence. And on Monday, as a positive presence.

"We are watching headline to headline," Jay Woods, chief market strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, told Yahoo Finance last week. "And when didn't we have headlines? We didn't get any headlines out of Washington last Friday [March 14]. We didn't get any headlines out of Washington last Monday [March 17]. Guess what we did? We rallied."

Oops, something went wrong

A rally in US stocks Monday morning amid reports that President Trump's tariffs will be less widespread than feared underscored how more clarity on the administration's new policies remains the key to a market bounce-back.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added about 0.8% or more than 300 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, rising about 1.5%. The rally came after both Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported Trump's "Liberation Day" reciprocal tariffs will be more measured than initially thought.

Tariff uncertainty was a key catalyst for the stock market sell-off over the past month. Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz told Yahoo Finance that he'd be watching for any clarity on those policies as the key turning point for the stock market's drawdown to potentially bottom.

"Usually, [when] the primary catalyst that stops becoming a problem, essentially, that allows the market to find its footing," Kantrowitz said.

Initially, investors had been waiting for April 2, the day Trump dubbed "Liberation Day," for more information on tariffs. But weekend reports indicated that the Trump administration has narrowed its focus on the tit-for-tat duties to what it has called the "dirty 15" countries — which have an unfavorable trade balance with the US.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business last week, "It's 15% of the countries, but it's a huge amount of our trading volume."

Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee wrote in a note to clients on Sunday night that markets appeared to be "setting up for a potential face-ripper rally this week as recent developments have eased several of the major fears that have weighed on equities since December."

"Trade war concerns are easing, brightening market sentiment," Lee wrote.

While Monday's market action shows markets have been hoping Trump's tariffs won't be as widespread as once thought, some equity strategists believe investors likely need official announcements from the administration before the tariff uncertainty overhang on stocks is fully removed.

"This relief that we're seeing is more a result of the fact that there was no sort of whiplash from the White House last week, and it seems like we've had more marginally positive news with respect to what tariffs might potentially look like on April 2nd," Raymond James chief market strategist Matt Orton told Yahoo Finance Monday morning. "But I don't know if there's too much that we can put into that until we actually have certainty, until we're actually past April 2nd."

‘Barron's Roundtable' panelists discuss the latest headlines around 23andMe and share top stock picks.

Genetic testing company 23andMe filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to help the $50 million company sell itself, the company announced Sunday.

23andMe's saliva-based kits have been helping customers learn about their ancestry since 2006, and the company said it will continue operating while the bankruptcy court facilitates the sale process.

News of the move raised concerns about how the personal data of millions of 23andMe customers will be handled. 

California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued a "consumer alert" regarding the "trove of sensitive consumer data 23andMe has amassed," reminding Californians that they have the right to direct the company to delete their genetic data, destroy their test samples and revoke permission for genetic data to be used for research.

"There are no changes to the way the Company stores, manages, or protects customer data," 23andMe said in a media release.

The company has experienced tumult in recent years. Last November, 23andMe said that it was cutting its headcount by 40%, or more than 200 employees. 

Co-founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki has resigned after multiple failed takeover bids, Reuters reports, but she said on X that she did it "so I can be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder."

Wojcicki will be replaced by CFO Joe Selsavage on an interim basis.

23andMe said it secured a debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing commitment for about $35 million and expects to continue operating during the sale process. It did not say if it had any other buyout interest or offers.

It listed both assets and estimated liabilities of $100 million to $500 million.

A month before its restructuring, 23andMe agreed to pay $30 million and give three years of security monitoring to settle a lawsuit accusing it of failing to protect the privacy of 6.9 million customers whose personal information was exposed in a data breach in 2023.

"We want to thank our employees for their dedication to 23andMe's mission," Mark Jensen, Chair and member of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors, said in a statement. "We are committed to supporting them as we move through the process."

English councils will be ranked according to their pothole fixing progress under government plans, with those who fail to publish updates losing out on millions in funding.

The Department for Transport (DfT) said local authorities' road maintenance pot would be boosted by £500m from mid-April, but councils must publish annual reports detailing progress on potholes or lose a quarter of that extra funding.

The prime minister told the BBC this would produce a rating system "so we know who is the best and who is not the best".

The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, said the government should focus on preventative measures rather than "reactively" fixing potholes.

Clearing the country's backlog of road repairs would take more than a decade and cost almost £17bn to fix, the LGA said, citing a survey from the Asphalt Industry Alliance.

According to data from the RAC, there are six potholes for every mile of road in England and Wales.

All English local authorities will get 75% of the extra cash promised, but if a council does not publish a report on road maintenance, including details on pothole filling progress, the remaining 25% will be withheld.

The held back funding will be given instead to councils the DfT believes have made proven progress.

The policy will only apply to English councils as funding for Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish local authorities is a devolved matter.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC a RAG (red, amber, green) rating system would be produced for councils on pothole maintenance.

He said that "until now, nobody has known how many potholes are being filled and where they're being filled".

"We all have the experience of driving from one place to the next and we know some places are better than others," he said, adding that the RAG system will help to avoid "the lottery that we have now".

However, Lucy Nethsingha, leader of Cambridgeshire County Council and chair of the LGA's Liberal Democrat group, said the amount of money was "nowhere near the amount that is needed".

"The implication that we are not spending it well is not helpful," she said, adding that the government was announcing "stuff that was already announced several times over and that doesn't help increase people's faith in politics".

"It's not clear that there is extra money coming as a result of this announcement. There is extra red tape and I don't think that's going to be helpful," she said.

She added in order to fix the roads in Cambridgeshire alone, the council had a shortfall £410m while the money the government was "re-announcing" for the whole of England was £500m.

"Our roads are like a worn out pair of trousers, you can keep fixing the holes, but what you actually need is a new pair of trousers - or in this case a proper resurfacing."

But the prime minister said "any council that says to me it's not enough money, I'd say come back to see me in June when you've actually filled these potholes in with your RAG rating and then we'll see if we can release more money to you". 

"Don't start the exercise complaining that you haven't got enough money."

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was "not pretending that the money we're making available will fill every pothole".

Asked whether withholding cash from some councils would just make things worse for drivers in some areas, she said she expected most local authorities would be able to "comply with these requirements".

"We want councils to be open and honest about how they are using that money so that the public can go onto their local council's website and see what action is being taken," she said.

Under the government's rules, councils must say how much they are spending, how many potholes have been filled and detail long-term road maintenance plans in reports that have to be published by the end of June.

By the end of October, councils must also demonstrate that communities have been consulted on where repairs should take place.

The DfT added that councils who "fail to meet these strict conditions" will see 25% of the funding withheld.

During the election campaign, Labour pledged to repair up to a million potholes a year in England.

The LGA said it was in "everyone's interests to ensure that public money is well spent". 

"This includes the government playing its full part by using the Spending Review to ensure that councils receive sufficient, long-term funding certainty, so they can focus their efforts on much more cost-effective, preventative measures rather than reactively fixing potholes, which is more expensive," it added.

Shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon described the government's announcement as a "pothole sticking plaster".

He said: "Labour like to talk a big game on fixing roads but they are more interested in chasing headlines."

The Liberal Democrats transport spokesman Paul Kohler called for a "more sustainable approach" to repairs, saying fixing individual potholes was welcome but did little to address a "crumbling road infrastructure".

Locals living near Weasenham Lane in Wisbech say the stretch is blighted by damaging potholes.

Emanuel will become executive chairman of the newly-named WME Group, Mark Shapiro will lead it as president and managing director, while Whitesell exits to launch a new Silver Lake-backed venture.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


Endeavor is private once more, as the $25 billion deal by Silver Lake closed Monday morning.


	With the take-private complete, a slew of changes are in order. For starters, the newly-private businesses will go by WME Group, retiring the Endeavor name for public-facing purposes.




	Ari Emanuel, who founded Endeavor in 1995 and most recently served as CEO of the public venture, will shift to a new role as executive chairman.


	Mark Shapiro, who had been president and COO of Endeavor, will become president and managing partner, working in conjunction with Christian Muirhead and Richard Weitz, the WME co-chairs who will be co-chairmen of WME Group.

	And as widely expected, former Endeavor executive chairman Patrick Whitesell will exit to launch a new venture backed by Silver Lake that will “invest in and scale properties and IP across sports, media, and entertainment.” When the take-private was announced a year ago, it was noted that Whitesell's employment agreement included a provision for a new company backed by $250 million from Silver Lake.


	Emanuel will continue as chairman and CEO of TKO Group Holdings, the public company that owns UFC and WWE, and Shapiro will continue as president and COO of TKO.


	WME Group will include the WME agency, marketing firm 160over90, IMG licensing, and the unscripted studio Pantheon Media Group (formerly named Asylum Entertainment).


	“This remarkable moment— and the even more exciting future it launches—is thanks first and foremost to Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell, and to the relentless and ambitious strategic vision they have shared for more than twenty years to build Endeavor into a global powerhouse across talent, brands, and IP spanning entertainment, media, and sports,” Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban said in a statement, adding that his firm has never sold a share in the company. “Silver Lake is proud and honored to be their partners since 2012 as they have continued to build the company. Over this period, revenue has grown by twentyfold. Silver Lake has previously invested on six separate occasions to support Endeavor and now, with this latest investment, it is the single largest position in our global portfolio.”


	“Mark Shapiro is an impressive, hard charging, creative, and determined leader who is driving and orchestrating massive value creation,” he added. “We look forward to continuing our work and partnership with him and the rest of the management team — including Richard Weitz and Christian Muirhead at WME Group and Dana White, Andrew Schleimer, and the collective TKO leadership — all of whom are industry best.”

	











	“Our ability to deliver landmark partnerships, career-defining business opportunities, and enduring cultural moments is amplified by this transaction and the formation of WME Group,” Shapiro added. “The Silver Lake team has proven time and again that they are all-in on representation and content, and our clients, partners, and employees will thrive under our new structure.”


	“I am grateful to Egon and the team at Silver Lake for the trust they have placed in me as a founder and entrepreneur,” Emanuel added. “Together, we have created and enhanced a foundation unlike any other to accelerate value creation for clients and partners across WME Group and TKO, which I am excited to continue to build and grow.”


	“Everything we built at Endeavor would not have been possible without the partnership of Egon and the entire Silver Lake team,” Whitesell said. “Our industry is in the very early stages of generational transformation. I have never seen a more promising time for bold and ambitious entrepreneurs, creatives, and athletes.”


	“Silver Lake is enormously pleased and energized to partner and invest with Patrick in support of his new platform,” Durban added of the Whitesell venture.

Oops, something went wrong

The Federal Reserve continued to signal it will cut interest rates two more times this year, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell adopting a perceived dovish stance, a pleasant surprise for investors who came into Wednesday's policy decision with heightened fears over "stagflation" and the possibility of a US recession.

"It's a clearing event," Dennis DeBusschere, president of 22V Research, told Yahoo Finance following the decision. "You didn't get a Fed that was going to accelerate the downside in markets."

One big reason stemmed from the Fed's "base case" that tariff-induced inflation will be "transitory" and have a short-term "one-off" effect on price growth. This was reflected in the central bank's projections, which forecast year-end PCE inflation rising to 2.7% before reaching its 2% target by 2027 — "a relief to investors" who had been bracing for stickier prices, according to DeBusschere.

But some experts warn that "transitory" inflation remains an unrealistic expectation — and that the projections for two rate cuts this year could unravel as the Trump administration continues to flip-flop on trade policy. Powell himself said that "there is a level of inertia" to stay consistent with prior forecasts until greater clarity emerges.

"Uncertainty was a highlight of the statement," Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, wrote in response to Wednesday's decision. "Like market participants, the Fed is at a highly uncertain point, and it is in need of time and data to determine the next course of action."

Both consumer and producer inflation showed a deceleration in price growth over the month of February. But details under the surface pointed to a potential stalling out in reaching the Fed's 2% target, with tariffs serving as the greatest threat to Powell's "transitionary" base case.

There are also concerns the Fed may cut rates because of a weakening labor market and slowing economic growth — a move that wouldn't be cheered by investors.

"Everybody wants two cuts, three cuts, four cuts. You don't want any cuts. You want earnings growth. You want a strong economy," Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday. "Be careful what you wish for."

Despite a slightly more hawkish tilt from the central bank, with more FOMC members forecasting interest rates to either hold steady or come down by just 0.25% instead of the consensus 0.50%, traders still boosted their own expectations of where interest rates could end the year.

According to the latest data from Bloomberg, markets are now pricing in three cuts instead of two. But Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird, pushed back on reading too far into the projections.

"The 'dot plot' and [the Fed's] projections have not been super reliable over the last five years," Mayfield said, stressing that the uncertainties within the current economic and political environment add another layer of confusion when it comes to future policy.

"When the path forward is so unclear, you just take it with a grain of salt, go back to basics, and focus on the drivers of either the individual equities or the sectors in the market that you own," he said. "In this case, thinking about things like earnings and long rates, rather than what the Fed is doing at the short end of the curve."

Following the Fed's decision on Wednesday, markets experienced what Mayfield described as a "relief rally," citing the lack of downside surprises in the forecasts. But the move higher was short-lived, with all three major indexes slipping into the red the following trading session.

Still, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow (^DJI) were able to eke out gains over the five-day period, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which has struggled as its "Magnificent Seven" leaders fail to deliver outsized returns, ultimately fell short.

"If you're going to really climb your way out of this hole, you need either clarity on the tariffs, which, who knows? Or you need some other sort of nice catalyst," Mayfield said. "That could come in the form of next earnings season, or maybe it's a really strong jobs report that comes out of nowhere."

"For now, we're kind of bouncing around and Powell's presser just wasn't enough to give the market the juice it needed to really get over the hump."

The University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD) has officially opened The Innovation Matrix, a cutting-edge 2,200 sq. m facility in Swansea's SA1 Waterfront.

Designed to drive digital innovation, entrepreneurship, and industry collaboration, the new space is situated alongside the university's existing IQ and Y Fforwm buildings. It has already attracted nine businesses to its high-quality working spaces, creating a dynamic cluster with the added benefit of direct access to UWTSD's expertise and research.

Funded through a strategic partnership between UWTSD and the Swansea Bay City Deal, the Innovation Matrix offers an opportunity for established businesses and dynamic start-ups to accelerate new product development, access specialist technical support, hire graduate talent and create knowledge exchange partnerships with the university.

The building was developed by Kier Construction, which secured £6 million worth of contracts for Wales-based businesses during the construction process.

The launch event was attended by representatives of the Welsh and UK governments, civic leaders, and industry partners, including:

Dame Nia Griffith, MP, said:

“It's great that UK Government funding, through the Swansea Bay City Deal, has contributed to building this wonderful facility. Our key mission, as set out in our Plan for Change, is economic growth.

 

“The Innovation Matrix will provide space for established businesses to grow and new businesses to start up, creating jobs in the high-tech industries of the future.”

Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Energy and Planning, Rebecca Evans, said: 

“We want Wales to be at the forefront of innovating new technologies that drive meaningful change in society and benefit people in their day-to-day lives.

 

“This exciting development will nurture a first-class ecosystem for digital innovation and enterprise that can be a catalyst for economic growth and prosperity.

 

“It is a testament to the excellence partnership working can deliver for regional economies in Wales and is another step forward on our journey to a stronger, fairer, greener future.”

Among the companies who have already taken up residence at the Innovation Matrix are:

Professor Elwen Evans, KC, Vice-Chancellor of UWTSD said: 

“The opening of this new building marks a significant step in digital innovation, providing a unique opportunity to collaborate, co-locate, and thrive in a high-quality space designed for partnership working. By bringing together industry and education, we are fostering an environment where cutting-edge ideas can develop, talent can flourish, and innovation can drive economic growth.”

Cllr Rob Stewart said: 

“Swansea has a proud history for innovation and entrepreneurship, but there has been a shortage in recent years of high-quality offices and shared workspace environments to meet the needs of businesspeople and aspiring entrepreneurs.

 

“Supported by cutting-edge digital connectivity, the Innovation Matrix will complement several other projects in Swansea to help meet that need while also giving access to university expertise and research.

 

“It will support existing businesses, give start-up businesses an opportunity to thrive and help create jobs for local people.

 

“The Innovation Matrix will also combine with other developments like the 71/72 Kingsway office scheme to further reinforce Swansea's reputation as a city of business and investment.”

Nearly a quarter million Segway scooters are being recalled due to safety hazards, according to officials.

The recall was announced by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) on Thursday. The recall pertains to all 220,000 units of the Segway Ninebot Max G30P and Max G30LP KickScooters.

According to the CPSC, the recall was issued due to the models' folding mechanism, which may be faulty.

"The folding mechanism can fail and cause the handlebars or stem to fold while the scooter is in use, posing a fall hazard to consumers," the notice said.

As of Thursday, Segway has received 68 reports of folding mechanism failures. These caused around 20 injuries, ranging from abrasions and bruises to "lacerations and broken bones."

Segway advises owners of the recalled scooters to "immediately" stop using them.

"Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled scooters and contact Segway to receive information to determine whether the folding mechanism needs adjustment and to receive a free maintenance kit," the recall notice said.

"The kit includes tools and instructions for checking and tightening the folding mechanism and keeping it properly maintained."

The CPSC also noted that the vehicles, which were manufactured in China and Malaysia, sold for between $600 and $1,000 from Jan. 2020 to Feb. 2025. Consumers could have purchased the devices at Best Buy, Costco, Walmart, Target and Sam's Club, as well as Segway.com and Amazon.com.

The CPSC also included physical descriptions of the scooters, in case Segway owners aren't sure if they own the recalled models.

"The brand name ‘ninebot' appears on the foot platform and the top of the handlebars. The model number is located on a label on the side of the foot deck."

"The Max G30P model is 46 inches long, 19 inches wide, 47 inches high and weighs 42 pounds," the release continued. "The Max G30LP model is 44 inches long, 19 inches wide, 45 inches high and weighs 39 pounds."

Landlords are left with no choice to offset looming tax rises introduced by the chancellor, says trade body

Londoners might not bat an eyelid at paying £5 for a pint but the national average is poised to rise above that watermark for the first time, with publicans blaming tax rises introduced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.

The sobering milestone is likely to be reached next month, according to research by Frontier Economics, with the average price of a pint of beer on course to hit £5.01, up from £4.80.

The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), which commissioned the research, said landlords had been left with no choice but to raise prices to offset tax rises that are due to come into force in April.

Pubs will face greater overheads due to an increase in the national minimum wage, a rise in national insurance rates and a decrease in the threshold at which they start paying out national insurance.

Discounts on business rates paid by hospitality firms will also be cut from 75% to 40% from April.

The net cost to the pubs sector of these measures, introduced in last October's budget, will hit £650m in total, the trade body said. Last week the brewer Shepherd Neame, maker of ales including Spitfire and Bishops Finger, said it would raise its beer prices in response to rising taxes.

Emma McClarkin, the chief executive of the BBPA, said: “The cumulative impact of these taxes and regulations is now plain to see and it is highly unfortunate that the only way many pubs can remain viable is to pass on the array of upcoming costs to consumers.

“No one wants to see the cost of an average pint increase by a further 21p and break the £5 average pint barrier that will be required for pubs to maintain their punishingly slim profit margins.”

Pubs and the wider hospitality sector have struggled to recover from the impact of enforced closures during the Covid-19 pandemic, which left many with crippling debt burdens. The sector's budding recovery was then hampered by inflation and the accompanying cost of living crisis.

The number of pubs fell below 39,000 for the first time in December 2024 after hundreds of closures, according to the property data company Altus Group.

“It is more urgent than ever that government looks at ways to cap or reduce the costs of doing business so we can keep pubs open, preserve their community value and make sure the price of a pint remains affordable for all,” said McClarkin.

 Ethereum's market cap surpasses global giants like Toyota and Disney, highlighting its value despite trading 57% below its 2021 all-time high. 

Ether is trading at around half its all-time high price, but the Ethereum network is still valued higher than some of the world's most prominent companies. 

Ether (ETH) traded at roughly $2,088 at the time of writing amid continued exchange-traded fund (ETF) outflows, down over 57% from its all-time high of nearly $4,900 set in mid-November 2021, according to CoinMarketCap data. 

Despite this decline, Ethereum maintains a market capitalization of nearly $252 billion, surpassing global corporations such as Toyota ($250 billion) and the total market value of the precious metal platinum ($245 billion).

Other notable companies currently worth less than the Ethereum network include IBM, McDonald's, General Electric, Shell and Disney. If Ethereum were a company, it would be the fiftieth largest in the world, just behind Nestlé, with its market capitalization of nearly $256 billion.

Alex Obchakevich, founder of Obchakevich Research, told Cointelegraph that speculative interest significantly contributes to Ethereum's valuation, as well as its “freedom from the financial framework of traditional finance.” He added:

Flavio Bianchi, a Polkadot ambassador and the chief marketing officer of the decentralized fundraising platform Polimec, told Cointelegraph that the comparison is less insightful than it might appear at first. He highlighted that “Ethereum isn't a business” — it's infrastructure. He explained:

Obchakevich also suggested Ethereum became more attractive after it transitioned to proof-of-stake (PoS), reinforcing “its value as a deflationary asset with growth potential in the digital economy.”

Recent data from Ultra Sound Money shows that Ethereum is inflationary again, with an annual inflation rate of about 0.73% over the past 30 days.

The rate of inflation or deflation is largely dependent on the ETH fees burned by the network and the amount of newly issued Ether. Fees have been burned on the network since the implementation of EIP-1559 in 2021, which, paired with decreased issuance after the PoS transition, resulted in Ethereum being deflationary during sustained network activity.

IntoTheBlock data shows that on March 23, daily fees on Ethereum fell to a little over $337,000, the lowest value reported since June 2020. YCharts also shows that on March 23, there was only 118.67 ETH worth of fees, the lowest value reported this year.

Over the past 24 hours, ETH's value rose nearly 3.5%, increasing its market capitalization by about $9.3 billion, now totaling approximately $252.1 billion. For comparison, this figure exceeds Greece's gross domestic product (GDP), currently around $243.5 billion.

Obchakevich highlighted that other than being worth more than Greece's GDP, Ethereum's market cap is also higher than the GDP of countries such as Slovenia and Croatia combined. He said this is more than a curious factoid:

Pradeep Singh, CEO of enterprise privacy and security infrastructure firm Gateway FM, told Cointelegraph that these numbers reflect “a fundamental shift in how we value digital infrastructure”:

The Ethereum protocol continues to evolve as developers introduce innovations such as native rollups, further expanding the blockchain's capabilities and potential use cases.

Bitcoin traders are reacting positively to the United States (US) Federal Reserve's (Fed) policy shift. As BTC hovers around the $88,000 level on Monday, analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin price gains this week. Technical analysis supports Bitcoin's bullish thesis. 

With $5.8 trillion assets under management, Fidelity filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a US Treasury Fund, ‘OnChain', to be rolled out on the Ethereum blockchain., This product could hit the market as early as May 30, 2025 if approved. 

Trump-backed World Liberty Financial spent $3 million on MNT token purchase. The move follows a major network upgrade in the project. 

Bitcoin's bullish outlook is currently supported by the improvement in trader sentiment, technical analysis and the Federal Reserve's move towards quantitative easing. As traders turn bullish on the token, BTC hovers close to $88,000 and eyes a re-test of resistance at $90,000. 

Bitcoin price is 3% away from the resistance at the time of writing. Both key momentum indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) support the likelihood of BTC price gains. 

The RSI is sloping upwards and reads 51, which is above neutral. MACD flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line, showing an underlying positive momentum in the  Bitcoin price trend.





BTC/USDT price chart 

Bitcoin sentiment tracker shows that traders remain fearful, but less so relative to last week. The sentiment is improving according to the Fear & Greed Index. This is also supported by a nearly 9% increase in the Open Interest (OI) in Bitcoin derivatives in the last 24 hours. 

Bitcoin could test resistance at $90,000, and a daily candlestick close above this level could pave the way for a return to the $100,000 milestone in the coming weeks. 

Fidelity remains optimistic about the Ethereum blockchain and plans to bring its US Dollar-backed Treasury Fund on-chain as early as May 30, 2025, if the SEC allows it. The $5.8 trillion asset manager eyes better transparency and efficiency by leveraging Ethereum's blockchain infrastructure and does not involve tokenizing US Treasury securities. 

Fidelity's plan signals another positive step in Real-world Asset Tokenization (RWA), following in the footsteps of BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. With a fund backed 99.5% by US Treasury and cash, secured on the Ethereum blockchain, it could set a precedent for tokenized treasuries or the secondary market. 

Investors with a blockchain wallet could benefit from the transparency, which could drive higher adoption among web3 and crypto-first users. 

SEC nod could allow Fidelity to move the plan forward to make RWA a relevant narrative in crypto. Traders can expect more asset management giants to follow Fidelity in the coming months, and the narrative and RWA tokens could gain relevance. 

Donald Trump backed WLF's $3 million MNT token purchase is making headlines. The project completed a major network upgrade and is now on the radar of crypto traders and large wallet holders, as WLF adds $3 million worth of the token to its portfolio, tracked by on-chain firms like Arkham Intel. 

The Mantle Network is preparing for Ethereum's Pectra upgrade as part of the process the project integrated EigenDA last week to enhance scalability and ensure better compatibility. 

WLF's MNT purchase increases holdings to over $340 million; these include Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Tron (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), AAVE, Ethena (ENA), among others. 

MNT gained 6.37% on Monday, as traders react to the upgrade and WLF's purchase. The token is up nearly 4% in the last seven days and bullish technical indicators on the daily price chart support further gains in MNT this week.

Bitcoin traders are reacting positively to the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) policy shift. As BTC hovers around the $88,000 level on Monday, analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin price gains this week. Technical analysis supports Bitcoin's bullish thesis. 

Dogecoin open interest plunged to a near four-month low in mid-March before beginning a slow recovery. Mr. Fei Chen, founder and CEO of Intellectia AI, shared his thoughts on Dogecoin, a potential DOGE ETF, and the likelihood of DOGE inclusion in a US Strategic Crypto Reserve in an interview. 

Bitcoin price extends its gains and trade above $87,400 at the time of writing on Monday after recovering 4.25% last week. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicts that BTC could hit $110,000 before retracing to $76,500, supported by the US Fed's dovish stance on inflation and US President Donald Trump's flexibility on tariffs.

Solana's price extends its gains on Monday after recovering 5.32% last week. Reports suggest that the White House is narrowing its approach to tariffs set to take effect on April 2, likely omitting a set of industry-specific tariffs.

Bitcoin price stabilizes around $84,000 at the time of writing on Friday after recovering nearly 2% so far this week. The recent announcement by the US SEC that Proof-of-Work mining rewards are not securities could boost BTC investors' confidence.

According to Michaël van de Poppe, the likelihood of Bitcoin and Ethereum trending upwards is higher due to diminished panic over tariffs, no interest rate hike from Japan, and a significant downward movement in the US Dollar. These conditions are favorable for cryptocurrency price increases, which traders should consider for their strategies.

 Digital asset investment products record weekly net inflows for the first time in five weeks, but Ethereum-based ETPs have $86 million in outflows. 

XRP and Solana led all altcoin-based exchange-traded product (ETP) inflows during the week ending March 21, with $6.71 million and $6.44 million respectively, according to digital asset investment firm CoinShares.

Other altcoin inflows were comparatively modest, with Polygon (MATIC) logging $400,000 and Chainlink (LINK) adding $200,000.

Sentiment toward altcoins remained mixed overall, as Ether (ETH) alone saw significant outflows totaling $86 million. Other notable outflows included Sui (SUI), with $1.3 million, Polkadot (DOT), with $1.3 million and Tron (TRX) with $950,000.

Despite Ether's substantial outflows dragging down the altcoin sector, digital assets collectively reversed a five-week streak of net outflows, registering inflows of $644 million. Bitcoin (BTC) led this recovery with inflows amounting to $724 million, snapping its own five-week negative streak.

As Cointelegraph reported, Ethereum has now experienced net weekly outflows for four consecutive weeks, while Bitcoin recorded its largest net inflow since January.

CoinShares noted that the majority of inflows originated from the US, which accounted for $632 million, driven primarily by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). 

Positive sentiment, however, extended beyond the US, with Switzerland leading other regions at $15.9 million, followed closely by Germany ($13.9 million) and Hong Kong ($1.2 million).

Canada and Sweden lead outflows. Source: CoinShares

Although altcoins collectively suffered a net outflow driven primarily by Ethereum's performance, Solana and XRP emerged as the standout altcoin performers. 

In Solana's case, the US market is poised to introduce its first Solana futures exchange-traded funds (ETF), potentially paving the way for a future spot Solana ETF.

Related: XRP and Solana race toward the next crypto ETF approval

In Bitcoin's case, the approval of futures-based ETFs was initially favored by regulators due to the existence of a regulated market (the Chicago Mercantile Exchange), which provided assurances against potential market manipulation. However, this raised controversy over the SEC's continued rejection of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which directly hold the cryptocurrency. 

A pivotal lawsuit by Grayscale successfully challenged this inconsistency, compelling the SEC to revisit its stance and ultimately paving the way for approval of the long-awaited spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Meanwhile, XRP has seen a significant boost from the recent dismissal by the SEC of its long-running lawsuit against Ripple Labs.

MicroStrategy's Bitcoin stash reaches milestones, now over 2.55% of BTC's circulating supply.

Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has expanded its Bitcoin holdings past 500,000 BTC following its latest acquisition.

In a March 24 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company disclosed the purchase of 6,911 BTC for approximately $584.1 million, or an average of $84,529 per BTC.

The new addition brings MicroStrategy's total stash to 506,137 BTC. The company has now spent approximately $33.7 billion on its Bitcoin investments, with an average cost of $66,608 per coin. Given current market prices, the firm holds an unrealized profit estimated at over $10 billion.

This milestone strengthens MicroStrategy's role as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin by a wide margin. Its holdings now represent approximately 2.55% of the 19.8 million BTC currently in circulation.

Moreover, the scale of MicroStrategy's Bitcoin exposure is even more striking when compared to other major holders.

The firm owns Bitcoin equal to nearly half the amount held by all 12 US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which cumulatively hold around 1.1 million BTC.

It also holds Bitcoin equivalent to nearly half the amount believed to be owned by Bitcoin's mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, whose estimated stash is also 1.1 million BTC.

 Strategy acquired 6,911 BTC for $584 million during the latest dip, pushing its total Bitcoin holdings beyond 500,000, according to a new SEC filing. 

Update: March 24, 2025, 1:11 pm UTC: This article has been updated to include the settlement date of Strategy's $711 million offering.

Michael Saylor's Strategy has acquired over $500 million worth of Bitcoin as institutional interest and exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows make a comeback.

Strategy acquired 6,911 Bitcoin (BTC) for over $584 million between March 17 and March 23 at an average price of $84,529 per coin, according to a March 24 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Following the latest acquisition, the company now holds more than 500,000 Bitcoin, with a total of 506,137 Bitcoin acquired at an aggregate purchase price of roughly $33.7 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $66,608 per Bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses.

The milestone comes a day after Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor hinted at an impending Bitcoin investment after the company announced the pricing of its latest tranche of preferred stock on March 21.

The preferred stock was sold at $85 per share and featured a 10% coupon. According to Strategy, the offering should bring the company approximately $711 million in revenue scheduled to settle on March 25, 2025.

Strategy, the world's largest corporate Bitcoin holder, continues buying the dips despite widespread investor fears of a premature bear market.

Strategy's latest investment comes amid global trade war fears, which analysts say could weigh on both traditional and digital asset markets at least through early April.

Despite a multitude of positive crypto-specific developments, global tariff fears will continue to pressure the markets until at least April 2, according to Nicolai Sondergaard, a research analyst at Nansen.

“I'm looking forward to seeing what happens with the tariffs from April 2nd onward. Maybe we'll see some of them dropped, but it depends if all countries can agree. That's the biggest driver at this moment,” the analyst said during Cointelegraph's Chainreaction daily X show on March 21.

Risk assets may lack direction until the tariff-related concerns are resolved, which may happen between April 2 and July, presenting a positive market catalyst, he added.

US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariff rates are set to take effect on April 2 despite earlier comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicating a possible delay in their implementation.

Metaplanet has acquired more than 1,000 Bitcoin this month.

Japan-based Bitcoin investment firm Metaplanet has reported a record-breaking daily trading volume of ¥50.4 billion (around $337 million) following its latest BTC acquisition.

The surge places the company 13th among Japanese firms in terms of trading activity, outpacing automotive giant Toyota, which has the country's highest market capitalization.

Metaplanet CEO Michael Gerovich confirmed the milestone on social media platform X while stating that the unprecedented trading volume reflects rising investor confidence.

As a result, investor sentiment remains strong for Metaplanet's stock, which has climbed more than 7% in the past day and over 41% since the start of the year. According to Google Finance data, the stock trades at ¥5,060 (approximately $33) as of press time.

Meanwhile, the record-breaking activity came on the same day as Metaplanet's general shareholders meeting, which saw around 1,500 attendees.

Gerovich used the event to reiterate the firm's commitment to Bitcoin, saying:

“MetaPlanet will continue to move forward as a Bitcoin pioneer in Japan. The future is Bitcoin. We are just getting started.”

Metaplanet's trading activity spike comes as the firm ramps up its monthly Bitcoin purchases.

According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, Metaplanet has acquired 1,115 BTC through five separate transactions this month.

On March 3, it picked up 156 BTC, followed by 497 BTC on March 5. A week later, it bought 162 BTC. On both March 18 and March 24, Metaplanet added another 150 BTC each time—spending $12.6 million on each of the latter purchases.

These acquisitions bring its total holdings to 3,350 BTC, valued at current prices at roughly $291 million.

The aggressive buying reflects Metaplanet's long-term Bitcoin strategy, which aims to position itself as a key player in the digital asset space.

However, the firm is drawing global attention for its BTC holdings and recent high-profile moves.

One notable development is the addition of Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, to its strategic advisory board. His involvement is expected to elevate Metaplanet's profile as it scales its influence beyond Japan and into the United States.

Analysis Is the US retreating from its hardline stance on crypto? On Friday, the US Treasury Department lifted sanctions imposed on notorious crypto mixer Tornado Cash, once accused of washing billions in illicit crypto for criminals and nation-states alike.

In 2022, the Biden administration alleged that Tornado Cash had laundered upwards of $7 billion in virtual currency since 2019, including $455 million stolen by North Korea's Lazarus Group, leading to sanctions that prohibited its use. In 2023, US prosecutors indicted two of the founders of Tornado Cash, alleging the service facilitated more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds.

However, following a federals appeal court ruling in November which questioned the Treasury's authority to ban the crypto mixer's smart contracts as they were not the "property" of any foreign national, the sanctions have now been lifted, though authorities continue to express concerns about the platform's misuse.

"We remain deeply concerned about the significant state-sponsored hacking and money laundering campaign aimed at stealing, acquiring, and deploying digital assets for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Kim regime," the department said in a statement.

"Treasury remains committed to using our authorities to expose and disrupt the ability of malicious cyber actors to profit from their criminal activities through the exploitation of digital assets and the digital assets ecosystem. Treasury will continue to monitor closely any transactions that may benefit malicious cyber actors or the DPRK, and US persons should exercise caution before engaging in transactions that present such risks."

Cryptocurrency mixers are services that blend multiple users' cryptocurrencies to obscure transaction origins and destinations, enhancing privacy but also potentially facilitating money laundering.

Tornado Cash, launched in 2019 as an open-source Ethereum mixer, was intended to improve transaction privacy but was also exploited by malicious actors for illicit purposes.

One of the software's developers – Alexey Pertsev – was arrested by Dutch authorities in 2022 and convicted on money laundering charges in 2024, receiving a sentence of 64 months. He is currently appealing that verdict.

In August 2023, US authorities indicted Tornado Cash co-founders Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on charges including conspiracy to commit money laundering and sanctions violations. Storm was arrested and is fighting his case, while Semenov has eluded the authorities and is on the FBI's wanted list, for now.

The Treasury's decision to lift sanctions on Tornado Cash aligns with a broader shift in the current administration's approach to digital currency regulation.

Also on March 21, the Securities and Exchange Commission's Crypto Task Force held a public roundtable to discuss how existing securities laws apply to digital assets, and to consider the development of a new regulatory framework tailored to these technologies.

The meeting follows a busy week on the cryptocurrency front from the SEC. On March 19, the SEC dropped its appeal in a five-year legal case against XRP token supplier Ripple Labs, and two of its senior executives - cofounder Christian Larsen and CEO Bradley Garlinghouse.

"This is it – the moment we've been waiting for. The SEC will drop its appeal – a resounding victory for Ripple, for crypto, every way you look at it," said Garlinghouse on X. "The future is bright. Let's build."

About two weeks earlier, Garlinghouse met with President Trump to discuss the future of cryptocurrency and its regulation. He also reportedly donated $5 million to Trump's inaugural committee.

In the 2020 case, the SEC alleged that Ripple Labs raised approximately $1.3 billion through unregistered sales of XRP, violating federal securities laws. In July 2023, a court ruled that XRP sales on public exchanges did not qualify as securities transactions, though Ripple's direct sales to institutional investors did meet the criteria. The SEC initially appealed the decision, but withdrew its appeal mid-last week, leading to a more than 10 percent surge in XRP's price.

The SEC subsequently clarified that because proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining activities do not involve the offer or sale of securities, they fall outside the agency's regulatory remit.

"It is the Division's view that 'Mining Activities' in connection with Protocol Mining, under the circumstances described in this statement, do not involve the offer and sale of securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934," it said.

"Accordingly, it is the Division's view that participants in Mining Activities do not need to register transactions with the Commission under the Securities Act or fall within one of the Securities Act's exemptions from registration in connection with these Mining Activities."

The issue of cryptocurrency hasn't just been on the regulatory agenda, politicians are taking a closer look as well.

Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of senators updated pending legislation dubbed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which was passed by the US Senate Banking Committee.

The GENIUS Act was introduced in February and is designed to clarify the law in relation to stablecoins - digital currency that is tied to a traditional asset, like the US dollar. It would ensure that stablecoin suppliers obey anti-money laundering rules, ensure digital cash is tied to a real asset, and mandate regular audits and public disclosures to ensure transparency and consumer protection.

"The updated version of the GENIUS ACT makes significant improvements to a number of important provisions, including consumer protections, authorized stablecoin issuers, risk mitigation, state pathways, insolvency, transparency, and more," said co-sponsor Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY).

Gillibrand is not the only Democratic politician to support the legislation, and it's likely that it will need to hit the 60-vote threshold to pass into law with cross-party support. However, the ranking member of the committee, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), was not pleased with the result.

"The bill ignores basic consumer protections that apply to every other financial product available in America. If you're sending a US dollar from your PayPal wallet, and you get scammed, the CFPB has the authority, right now, to help you get your money back. But if this bill passes, and you're sending a stablecoin from your PayPal wallet and you get scammed, you may be out of luck," she opined.

"In fact, the bill even invites scammers into the market by refusing to prohibit people convicted of fraud and money laundering from owning stablecoin companies. Sam Bankman-Fried could buy a stablecoin company from prison and regulators would have no legal grounds to stop him under this bill."

While the House of Representatives has yet to take up the bill, strong bipartisan support for stablecoin regulation suggests it could receive a favorable reception once introduced. ®

Financial markets gave risk-on vibes early Monday during Asia hours based on reports that the next round of Trump tariffs due on April 2 could be more measured than initially expected.

Bitcoin (BTC), the largest digital asset by market value, traded at around $86,500, up 2.7% on a 24-hour basis, with Solana's SOL token trading nearly 6% higher at $138, according to CoinDesk data. 

Payments-focused XRP was up 2.5% at $2.44, trading above its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) after two consecutive weeks of positive price action.

Futures tied to the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq rose over 0.5% on the day, while Wall Street's fear gauge, the VIX index, slipped 2.5% to 18.88 points. Markets in China reversed early losses.

The sentiment improved as media reports over the weekend said President Donald Trump's planned "reciprocal tariffs" expected April 2 could be more focused than the barrage occasionally threatened. 

Some countries will be exempt, and existing levies on steel and other metals may not be cumulative, Bloomberg's report said.

Trump's tariffs roiled the market sentiment in February, sending both stocks and the crypto market lower. BTC fell nearly 17.6%, hitting lows under $80,000. Last week, the Federal Reserve revised its inflation forecasts higher while downgrading growth figures likely due to Trump's aggressive trade policies.

The Fed, however, called the tariffs-led inflationary impulse transitory while retaining forecasts for two rate cuts this year in a dovish move for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

The Fed action, coupled with prospects of easing tariffs, has revived bullish sentiment in the market. 

"I bet $BTC hits $110k before it retests $76.5k. Y? The Fed is going from QT to QE for treasuries. And tariffs don't matter cause “transitory inflation”. JAYPOW told me so," BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who is now chief investment officer at Maelstrom, said on X. 

The other key factors to watch out for in the coming days are Friday's PCE reading, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, and the appearance of the SEC nominee Paul Atkins and Comptroller of the Currency nominee Jonathan Gould before the Senate Banking Committee on March 27.

Bitcoin (BTC) hovers around $85,600 on Monday after recovering 4.25% last week. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) also followed in BTC's footsteps, hovering around their key levels after recovering almost 7% each the previous week. 

Bitcoin price broke and closed above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at around $85,502 last week but failed to find support around it. Moreover, it broke and closed above its 200-day EMA again on Sunday. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers around $85,600.

If BTC finds support around its 200-day EMA, it could extend the recovery to retest its key psychological level of $90,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 48, pointing upward toward its neutral level of 50, indicating fading bearish momentum. The RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator showed a bullish crossover on the daily chart last week, giving a buy signal and suggesting a bullish trend ahead. Additionally, it shows rising green histogram levels above its neutral level of zero, indicating strength in upward momentum.





BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if BTC fails to find support around its 200-day EMA and closes below $85,000, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $78,258.

Ethereum price was retested, and support was found around its daily level of $1,861 for the last two weeks, and it recovered nearly 7% last week. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers around $1,980.

If the daily support around $1,861 holds, the ETH price could extend the recovery to retest its March 7 high of $2,258.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 40, approaching its neutral level of 50, indicating fading bearish momentum. However, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained. The MACD indicator showed a bullish crossover on the daily chart last week, giving a buy signal and suggesting a bullish trend ahead. Additionally, it shows rising green histogram levels above its neutral level of zero, indicating strength in upward momentum.



ETH/USDT daily chart

However, if ETH breaks and closes below the daily support at $1,861, it could extend the decline to retest the next support level at $1,700.

Ripple price broke above its 100-day EMA at $2.31 last week and recovered almost 7%. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers around $2.42.

If the 100-day EMA around $2.42 continues to hold, it could extend the recovery to retest its next resistance level at $2.72.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 51, hovering around the neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among the traders. The RSI must point upward and move above its neutral level of 50 to sustain the bullish momentum. The MACD indicator showed a bullish crossover on the daily chart last week, giving a buy signal and suggesting a bullish trend ahead.



XRP/USDT daily chart

However, if XRP fails to find support around its 100-day EMA and closes below, it could extend an additional decline to test its next support level at $1.96.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Bitcoin traders are reacting positively to the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) policy shift. As BTC hovers around the $88,000 level on Monday, analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin price gains this week. Technical analysis supports Bitcoin's bullish thesis. 

Dogecoin open interest plunged to a near four-month low in mid-March before beginning a slow recovery. Mr. Fei Chen, founder and CEO of Intellectia AI, shared his thoughts on Dogecoin, a potential DOGE ETF, and the likelihood of DOGE inclusion in a US Strategic Crypto Reserve in an interview. 

Bitcoin price extends its gains and trade above $87,400 at the time of writing on Monday after recovering 4.25% last week. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicts that BTC could hit $110,000 before retracing to $76,500, supported by the US Fed's dovish stance on inflation and US President Donald Trump's flexibility on tariffs.

Solana's price extends its gains on Monday after recovering 5.32% last week. Reports suggest that the White House is narrowing its approach to tariffs set to take effect on April 2, likely omitting a set of industry-specific tariffs.

Bitcoin price stabilizes around $84,000 at the time of writing on Friday after recovering nearly 2% so far this week. The recent announcement by the US SEC that Proof-of-Work mining rewards are not securities could boost BTC investors' confidence.

Jon Nelson is living what he calls his “bonus life” after recovering from severe depression.

Aidan Kahn

By Laura Sanders

2 hours ago

In this bonus episode of The Deep End, listen to an interview with Jon Nelson. He'll share how he's doing these days, now that his depression is gone. You'll hear about the work still ahead of him, which may be lifelong. And you'll hear about his plans for the future. 

Laura Sanders: This podcast deals with mental illness, depression and suicide. Please listen with care.

Hi listeners, we're dropping into your feeds this week with a special bonus episode of The Deep End. Over the last six episodes, you've heard about some of the hardest parts of Jon Nelson's life. And some of the best parts too. He's struggled through severe depression. He volunteered for an experimental treatment that involved brain implants, and now he's relearning how to live. For this bonus episode, we're going to check in with Jon and see how he's doing these days. You'll hear more from him about what it was like to go through severe depression, and what it's like now that he's out from under it, now that he's living what he calls his bonus life. Welcome to The Deep End. I'm Laura Sanders.

I called Jon in December of 2024, over two years out from his surgery. Here are parts of our conversation, including the part where he tells me that he's become friends with another person you might remember from the podcast, Amanda, the artist in New York City who had DBS surgery, too. Take a listen.

Sanders: Hi, Jon.

Jon: How is life? How you doing?

Sanders: Good. I'm doing really well. How about you?

Jon: I am too. I, a lot of, lot of stuff going on. My one colleagues says, a lot of momentum. I'll take momentum. Momentum is a good term.

Sanders: Oh my, yes. Thank you for talking to me again. Are you tired of me yet?

Jon: No, man, I'm, I'm all in, all the time. Your family OK? You guys doing OK?

Sanders: Yeah, we're all good. We're in the Christmas, you know, mayhem crash landing into the new year. How about you?

Jon: It's like, I just like Thanksgiving so much more, so less pressure, you know what I mean? It's like, the planning for a month for five minutes of opening gifts to like the crash, you know. Holidays are hard. I'm one of those where they're hard for me, so it's, they're less hard than they used to be, but still not like my favorite time of year.

I've become super close friends with Amanda, who I saw for that video after mine, and I reached out to Figee, and was like, “Yo, I was like, send my information to her.” And dude, immediately, she reached out and we've become, we've come tight. I may have told you this, but I, she ended up sending me her artwork. I was like, “Dude, can I get some of your artwork?” And, she sent me the high-res PDFs so I have it in like all my kids' bedrooms. 

Sponsor Message

Sanders: That's awesome. Which ones do you have in there?

Jon: The subway one is like my favorite, so that's in my musicians, kids' room and one of them with the heart, it's Amanda with the heart, is in my other kid's room, and the third one is blanking me right now, but, dude, they're just beautiful, like every one I see, and then she did, did you know she did a DBS book? Like how incredible is that? Like, it's just so neat, you know, that just. I love creativity. I love people with passion and creativity, and you can't beat that with her.

Sanders: Yeah, yeah. I mean, she, she sent that book and we used a few of the drawings to illustrate the, the new, the online version of this story, and it just like got me. You know, you can describe it in words and you can even hear her talking about it, but then seeing the way she kind of puts these colors together and like, designs it all, it's gorgeous.

Jon: We do like a monthly support group I started three years ago and, you can just tell, I can tell with every person, like their posture, their skin complexion, their, how animated they are. I know exactly where they are.

Sanders: Yeah. Is it Zoom? You meet on Zoom?

Jon: Yep. It's actually, well, it's a Google Meet, but yeah, it's web conference and it started from my first article that I did about three years ago, actually three years ago now, it was December 2nd, 2021. That's weird. That was, yeah, three years ago. And that's, I just had so many people reach out to me that were similar situations, high functioning folks, suffering through hell. And so that was kind of the goal was, you know, kind of a high-functioning mental health support group of people, like-minded folks who are in theory, what people think is hiding it, where we are not hiding it, but we are struggling and it's been great. Just like sometimes two people join, sometimes 15 people join, you know, it's just each month is different and it's been really cool.

Sanders: What kind of things do you talk about?

Jon: So in that support group, it's check-ins. It's where, where are you at right now? What's, what's changed? What's, where's your mind? Situational stuff, you know. Guys, how would you move forward with this? Which, you know, relatability. It's just all peer-based support and with zero intent or goal other than to be around like-minded people and be able to get as, as, as healthy as we can.

And just, you know, when you're dealing with a condition like we deal with, you know, being able to be around people who understand the hell and who also understand the stupidity of society for stigmatizing us, it's a really wonderful thing to feel quote unquote normal for a half a second.

Sanders: Yeah, yeah, it makes a ton of sense. And now, if you don't mind, I'll shift into kind of the same question for you, you know, Where, where are you right now? How are you doing?

Jon: So right now, I am just over two years from my surgery date. So I've been in remission for two years of this maniacally horrific disease. That does not mean that it is simple. It is easy. It's the exact opposite of that. I still have to work on it daily. I still have to be, maintain my, you know, try to keep my mood as neutral as it possibly can be. And, you know, one of the main things that I would say is, you know, Dr. Mayberg telling me that I needed to rehab my brain, and I didn't understand what that meant. And, you know, learning how to deal with sadness and kind of, have that being part of my life is extremely triggering for me still to this day. And I, you know, I went into the surgery, you know, hoping I would die. And, you know, coming out of it not dead, and coming out of it in remission from this disease is like winning the lottery. It wasn't even something that I thought was plausible. And so to come out of it and be disease free, is, is still earth-shattering to me.

But then I never would have thought that you take it one step further. And I am dealing with trauma. You know, I'm dealing with trauma from living in hell for as long as I did. And being an empath, being a middle child, being an emotional person, which I know is shocking to say as a dude, but that's what I am. And so to have your emotions completely pulverized and twisted and tortured for a decade, you know, you truly focus in on, on all aspects. And so I have to learn how to live with something that is part of my life for the rest of my life, which is being sad. And so being sad is an absolute normal human emotion. And sadness, anger, happiness, like they all happen and they come into your body and they leave your body. And so, I know that it's going to leave, but guess what? My analogy would be, you know, an alcoholic who has to, every once in a while, take a very, very large sip of alcohol, of wine. It would be very challenging for them to deal with that. It's the exact same scenario that I have. I still have to feel sadness. And so it's actually been very helpful for me too, in trying to explain to people the hell of this disease is we all have to experience human emotions. It's the cycle of life. The disease of severe depression is, you take that, you take that emotion of general sadness, maybe it's at a three out of 10, 10 being death. And it's doubled, it's tripled, and it never leaves your body. So those bad moments that you have, imagine multiplying them by, you know, two, three, four, five, and it never leaves your body. And the only thing consistent that you have is every day it gets a little worse. That's what it's like to deal with severe depression in a treatment-resistant form. And so add that feeling and thought onto an additional flame of society being stupid and judging and blaming and ostracizing millions of people for having this condition that nobody has asked for just like every other disease. That's why everyone dies. That's why everybody suffers. And it's that simple. And so to think that I can go through this and prove to the world that this is a biological disease, I just have a circuit off of my brain. I have 23 million pulses going into my brain, every day. If I do not have that electricity, I go immediately back into this maniacally horrific disease.

And so the fact that society judges, labels, blames, ostracizes me and millions of other people for something that we did not ask for is the reason that healthcare costs for this disease and all the other comorbid conditions exist. It's because of the stupidity of society for blaming, labeling, judging, ostracizing for a disease that we didn't ask for. You look at cancer, there is communal love, support, a hug. And that's exactly how it should be. It's beautiful. Like, let's take care of you, your family. We feel sorry for you. The exact opposite is serious mental illness. That's the problem. That's why everybody suffers and dies.

Sanders: Yeah, I, I remember you telling me it's a non-casserole disease, and that really struck me.

Jon: It is a one hundred percent non-casserole disease. Everybody lines up, everybody, everybody goes over to the person's house who's suffering from cancer. Meals are coordinated every single day. People are driving folks down for therapy and treatment. It's beautiful. It's the best part of humanity, and you could not get a more further from reality situation than serious mental illness, and it's absolutely appalling to me. It's unjust and it's right in everybody's face on why everybody suffers and dies. And people just continue to do it. So that's my mission for the rest of my life is to poke society, to let them know that their behavior is absolutely directly responsible for suffering and death.

Sanders: You described your depression as feeling like a poison in your body. Do you feel that poison anymore?

Jon: So my depression, the feeling that I had is, my two biggest symptoms before going into surgery were a constant desire for death, euphoria to die. I wouldn't, I'd thought about suicidal ideation as much as I was breathing. I mean, it was that pervasive and consistent in my life. And so that's my mind portion of it. And then my second portion of it was exactly what you said, physically ravaged my body. And so to explain that to you, think about the feeling that you get, the full-body sensation feeling you get when you have a fever, right? You have the aches, you have the shakes, you have the, it's just pure discomfort, right? Like this is awful. So take that feeling, that same physical overwhelming feeling, and it's just death and dread, just circulating through my body. Like I could feel it in my fingertips. I could feel it everywhere. And so to wake up from the surgery, and they turn the device on, and both of those are gone, immediately, like gone. It's still surreal to this day. And so when I think about the before and afters, I, I, there was just so many. I mean, one of them that is just so vivid to me is I got this massive tattoo before my surgery on my left arm. I've never gotten a tattoo. I wanted to kind of, you know, do something to, I don't know if the right word is commemorate, memorialize. I don't even know what it is. I guess symbolically, you know, represent my fight through this hell. And so I just, a big nature scene on my left arm, and that's because being out in nature, specifically around trees, you know, reduces symptoms of depression. So I was like, all right, let's bring it here. I didn't feel it. You know, they put, they took four days to get this thing on. And I didn't feel it. It wasn't pleasant. It wasn't unpleasant. It was just there. And I had to go back and get it touched up after my surgery, and I had to have her stop multiple times, cause I could feel again in my body. I could actually feel something other than the hell of this horrific disease. And so that's an absolute perfect example.

Sanders: I wonder if there are any surprises that have come out of all of this. After going through the run-up to the surgery, the surgery itself, kind of this rehab portion. Were there any unexpected changes or anything that happened that surprised you?

Jon: For sure. I think that I very quickly learned that I'm living a bonus life. And it's a lot of fun living a bonus life, because things that you typically would say, wouldn't say or you would think, but I don't know if I should say this or do this, I fully embrace those moments, you know? I fully embrace them, and I say what most people wouldn't. And that's mostly positive. That's some negative, and I enjoy that with my advocacy because I like poking. I like poking because I want you to think differently. And I will tell you the most, like similar, some of these things are kind of taboo, right? Oh, don't talk about mental illness in the work setting and blah blah blah. I do the opposite. I go straight at it hard. The more, the more raw that I am, the more pokey that I am, the more successful that I have become with my advocacy and with momentum. And there's not been one thing that I have done in this outside world of being in remission of depression and talking about it and being very open about it and being very raw, being very real, that has been negative in the slightest bit. It's been nothing but positive.

Sanders: A bonus life. I love that phrase and that thought. Does it show up with your family? Do you feel like you're living a bonus life with your kids and your wife?

Jon: A hundred percent. I owe everything to them. I owe everything to my wife, you know, she's just a rock, the most amazing person, you know, the only person that these horrific maniacal diseases are, are, are worse for than the person suffering is the caretaker, caregiver, and that was my wife. And so to be able to see the hell that she went through while watching the person that she loves, who I know I'm a good father, a good provider, a good husband, just deteriorate. And all those things are on her now. And she's her, her, her bandwidth is zero, and, you know, society is not helping her. Society is judging her too. And it's horrific. And so to be able to, to be able to see, you know, her in the scenario that we're in now, which is, we're out of it, you know, we're out of it. She's still cautious. It's been two years. She's still cautious. I'm still cautious. I'm always afraid, you know? Use your cancer remission. You know, I'm in remission, but I still gotta get checked and make sure it doesn't come back, you know? So we always will live with that fear, but yeah, I mean, just, just the the, the standard, the typical embrace. The hugs are different. The watching a show together is different. The being around the kids is different.

You know, my kids, it's all they knew, right? They knew I'm a good dad. They knew they got to see me healthy dad prior, and they also had to see sick dad, and they knew that it wasn't me, they knew it was the disease, they truly did, you know, and and I talked to him about it all the time of, “Guys, how did this impact you?” And they're like, “It's all we knew. It was our life and it's great to have you back.”

And so to come out of this on the other side and be able to have just genuinely enjoy your time together and have conversations and be able to throw a football with them again, you know, be able to take my daughter, she's turning 16, we're going over Christmas. I'm taking her on a dad-daughter trip to San Francisco and we're gonna drive down the coast to L.A. Like, do you know how beautiful that is? I mean, I, it's just stunning that I can do that now and enjoy every single moment, you know? Including the, every single minute in that car ride down and the laughter and the music. I couldn't do that before. Now I, I can experience joy in a healthy way and enjoy it tremendously, and grow very important relationships in my life.

Sanders: Yeah, yeah, it does seem like just a qualitatively different thing to feel that way versus the absence of something awful. Yeah, yeah. Are you taking your daughter to where you used to live?

Jon: When the kids turned five years old, and my wife and I were like, let's take them on a trip, like each individually, like mom, dad, kid trip. It's just a fun age, you know, he turned five and my my middle guy, I'll give an example, is like, I wanna go to New York City, and so we went to New York City and he's five years old out on, I still remember Park Avenue and 37th Street, holding his hand up, hailing a cab. You know, we're doing all the, you know, it's just was fun, right? It's like one of those moments where like they really can experience life and understand it and do some cool stuff. And so we just came up with this. My daughter's turning 16, and so my wife and I are like, let's do something like that. Like, let's give them another opportunity. And I happen to be extremely lucky, cause it works out perfectly for me to be able to take her. So we're just doing a solo trip. And so she could pick anywhere in the world, literally, we're like, where do you wanna go? What do you wanna do?

And it really makes you realize how nostalgic people are for their origins, and she was born and raised out in San Francisco. She left when she was four, but it's still part of her identity. And so the fact that she picked going to San Francisco and driving down the coast and stopping at Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay and Carmel and, you know, hitting, hitting L.A. It's pretty cool, you know? And so that's, that's, that's really what drove it is, you know, I think let's get back to my, my hometown and let's smile and see some beauty and make some great memories.

And so, you know, my big thing with my kids is I always try to go to a high level in regards to what am I trying to achieve. And, you know, parenting is, is not easy. It's, it's, I always say you want to hug them 10 times a day and punch them 10 times a day, right? There's, there's ups and downs and it's, it's overall amazing. But, you know, being able to get your kids out of the house, like my focus is always on, you know, if you can have, you know, if you can be a good, independent person and you can be confident, I did my part and, you know, I'm very, very fortunate that, you know, my daughter is right there. And, you know, being able to help guide that and being able to play a part in making that happen is, is really, really fun for me. And that's what motivates me as a parent.

Sanders: Yeah, that makes perfect sense, seeing them kind of launch in their own lives and, and knowing you did what you needed to do, and now they're going to go off on their own adventures.

Jon: If you hit those two qualities, all the other ones come. That's why you gotta start high. Everything else will happen.

Sanders: Shifting a little bit to the research, I wonder if you're still involved in the research project at all, and if so, what that looks like.

Jon: So here's a human behavior thing that I find fascinating is we had to do two times a day, we had to commit to a journal, a video journal. We had to do eight minutes of brain scans. Essentially they would analyze my brain waves. We had to do multiple, multiple choice questions on our, on our feelings. We had to do that twice a day, so it was a commitment and, and that was something that was not a problem. Let's go. Like, this is what I gotta do for this, there's a lot of, a lot of to do's. We had to do our part. And at about six months, that turned into once a day. And then a couple of months later, it was once a week. And so I'm at that phase now where it's, it's once a week. But, but here's the challenge. The challenge is, it's harder to do once per week than it is to do twice a day every day. How wild is that, right? And so that's my challenge is like, I screw up and don't make my deadlines a lot. And so it's, you know, it's something that's always in the back of my head. And so the short answer is, is, yeah, I'll be connected to these guys for an extremely long time, and it's amazing. At some point I'll be stopping the kind of video journal and the brain activity, but I still meet with the psychiatrists on a quarterly basis, and it's more of a check-in. They're still fully available to me when I email. The humanity that this group has provided me is, is exceptional. And they're in my corner. You know, at some point I'm gonna need to change. I have the R plus S Medtronic investigational device in my chest. That's the pacemaker, and they have a new commercial grade of available device that I will have to get into my chest. So they'll basically cut me open and swap that out. It's a battery. They say pacemaker, but it's a battery. That's how I look at it. So I'll get the newest and greatest battery in there, and that's also something that will be included as part of the trial. I know Medtronic has provided those to them as part of this clinical trial.

When you go through severe depression, serious mental illness in this country which is apparently the best country on the planet which I highly, highly, highly contest based off of going through this journey, and then you walk into a clinical trial environment like I did, I can't begin to tell you the difference, like how absolutely different they are, and how broken our mental health system is in this country. I had physicians looking at me in the eye. I had them telling me that they want to help me, that they know something's wrong with me, that they believe me, that they can fix me. I'm saved for sure by this medical technology in my brain, a hundred percent. But it's not just that. It's definitely that, but it's also their humanity. It's their empathy. It's how they talk to me. It's how they believe me. That is absolutely part of this, and that's where it needs to be all the time, especially with a disease, like with the, the diseases within serious mental illness. That's all we're dealing with is broken minds. So to be able to help, help a broken mind by being kind, costs no money. Looking at somebody in the eye costs zero money, nothing. You don't need millions of dollars of consultants to fix this problem. You need to create an environment that can get people into the healthcare system sooner. And you need to get the people who are in there. Guess what? When you're getting somebody a year into living through hell versus 10 years, again, I have no validation for this, but it's a pretty logical assumption to think, it'd be a hell of a lot easier to fix that after a year rather than 10 years.

Sanders: Yeah, and it hits home when you talk about kind of the rehab portion of your brain, too. Like if you're trying to change after a decade of these patterns that you've adapted to and learned to live with versus a year of that, that rehab portion's gonna be a lot easier too.

Jon: Absolutely, one hundred percent. And I, I didn't understand the significance of the rehab portion, and that's something for sure that I've taken out of this. And my initial thought was, dude, I'm good. I don't feel this disease all over my body and my mind isn't warped with constant suicidal ideation. That was naive of me, because I got to understand that it is an absolute journey. I need to continue to put the work in. I need to continue to not get super angry with certain situations before that would make me angry, that would put me right into a recurrence. And so I need to sit back and you know, not let certain situations bug me like they would as much as they typically do, right? I need to be very cognizant of my mood to keep it as neutral as possible to avoid any major ups or major downs.

Sanders: You told me a while back you're still crabby. You were crabby, you're still crabby. Do you still feel crabby now?

Jon: You know, irritability was probably the one characteristic that stayed similar. And so my, my joke about it, but it's probably true, is, you know, I'm just like I guess certain aspects of my life, I'm the cranky old dude, right? Like it just happens throughout life. You're tired, you're exhausted, you're going, being pulled in a million directions and you're parenting and then things don't stop. So yes, I do get irritable still, but you know, that's called being a human being. I'm not anywhere near perfect, but in general, my smiles are back more and I feel, I feel really good. Am I perfect? Nope. This, this, this, this surgery does not, does not cure life problems, but it sure, it sure eliminates and destroys a horrific disease that's in your body.

Sanders: So when I visited your house, there were some jokes about hiding your charger and changing your settings, and I wonder if you all still joke about things that that are kind of in this realm.

Jon: Yeah, you have to add humility and humor and laughter to all of this. And, you know, yes, a hundred percent. And, you know, a simple way to think of that, my, my wife saying after the first week of me being home, her line to the doctor was, “Is there any chance we can turn the volume down on this a little bit?” Because I'm back. I'm back with a force. And, you know, it's that, they say that with a big smile on their face. And you know, I, I, I joke around with my, you know, family, my daughter. I'm like, so what is it like when we weren't here this weekend, you know, myself and my boy, we were at like a hockey tournament, so it's like, “It's a lot quieter.” So like, that stuff's awesome, you know? Like, I mean, it's just, it's such a prime example of like what this disease does, this brain disease, that's what this is, you know. It just mutes you. It, it takes you away from everybody. It takes your core essence away. And so being able to have that back is great. And so my line to them all the time when they're busting my chops and, and, and having fun with this, which they should, is, you chose me. You chose me. It's not on me, dude. You picked me, guys. The kids didn't really. They're kind of forced in this scenario, but the wife did.

Sanders: She totally did. I love it. Very true. You've done so much evocative explaining of what this felt like and what this disease has done to you, how it's affected you, how it's affected your family. I wonder if there's a way to explain to someone who's not felt this firsthand and may not have a family member or a loved one who's felt this. What would you say to them, to kind of sum up what this disease is like?

Jon: To those folks who have no understanding of this, I will say a couple things. There's not many of you. You know, when I start talking about this publicly and speaking, there's always somebody. Either it's a friend or a family or them. There is a connection to somebody with lived experience, so they've gotten to see firsthand most of the time what this looks like. And for those who haven't, awesome. I'm so happy that you have not been exposed to it, and it's the most simplistic thing in the world. The symptoms of this disease, the brain disease of severe depression, the symptoms are a desire to die and a consumption of your body with hell. It's toxicity burning within your body. That's the symptom. The symptom of another neurological disease, Parkinson's, is shaking, right? It's tremors. You know, look at epilepsy. It's seizures, right? The symptoms are different, based off of every disease. The fact that society doesn't understand and questions and judges folks with severe depression is what makes them die, and the unfortunate portion of this is the major symptom of these are torture. And so that's what we have to understand, is that the people who have this horrific disease didn't ask for it, at all. And so being able to surround them with love and kindness like you do with every other disease, and let them know that you love them and you care for them, it's life-saving.

Sanders: If we could shift to kind of the future now, I, I wonder if there's something you picture for yourself, you know, in, in the next year, in 2035? Where do you want to be? In 2050, where do you want to be? What's, what's on your long-term horizon?

Jon: I've have a colleague of mine that has been, said something very cool to me that sums up where I am right now with my patient advocacy. I actually call it more activism, because I do wanna poke and I do want to make people feel uncomfortable, so that they can change their behavior, is you have a lot of momentum right now. And I like that I have a lot of momentum. I unfortunately, am not listening to Dr. Helen Mayberg, who after the trial said, “You need to take it easy. You need to not do too much.” Well, I'm not listening to her cause I'm doing a lot, and I'm, but here's the fun reason why, is, I am extremely motivated. I'm extremely passionate for this. There is a massive, massive, massive problem with a very simple solution, and I'm going to be in your face until the day that I die poking you and letting you know that you're absolutely wrong and that, you know, we have the most simplistic way that we can possibly fix this, the complete moronic world that we're in right now, which is simply by showing empathy and being kind to people with mental illness. Then we save, we save lives. We save suffering. Like, let's go. I'm all about it.

And so when I look at 10 years from now, you know, in the last year, I have been so fortunate to be in the world that I've been in. I mean, being a part of your Science News piece, I was able to speak in the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. I was able to participate in a congressional briefing for the neuroscience caucus in April. I've been able to, you know, lead multiple academics, physician conventions and sessions. I mean, every opportunity I get, I just smile, and I just say, “Let's go.” You know, phenomenal opportunity for more exposure, for more places to get the, the message out.

So my long, my aunt always says to make a long story endless, to make a long answer endless, I will, I want to poke and prod and be at the point where people are like, “This dude, this dude, this dude is all in, like, all in.” And so my Pulverize the Stigma initiative I have that I've created, this is just my personal brand. I got it tattooed on me, right? Like I am officially all in on this.

Sanders: Before we end, I wanna ask how Barbara is doing, how your kids are doing. What's the update with everybody?

Jon: Kids are cruising. We got 6th grade, 8th grade, 10th grade, all so different, all so fun to figure out what makes, makes each one of them tick and support those passions and create those, you know, good values that we're trying to do as a family. And you know, my wife is, she's just a rock. So my, my world is is hectic and crazy and it's kind of chess pieces putting around everywhere to make things work, and it's, and it's really going well. And so to still have her be this rock of the family, which she is. I mean, it's not fair, moms and, moms get a lot put on them, you know, for, for the houses and the families. It's just true. I mean, it's just the reality, and it's not right, and we're doing everything we can to, to, to pull our weight and make a, make a bigger impact on this family, but my God, she is just the strongest person I know. She puts everybody else before her and, you know she's thriving right now at work. She's about to start a new job, which is something extremely excited for, at a new great company, and it's fun to see her smile and laugh. And you know, she had a day home from work yesterday, an unplanned day home from work, and you know, to be able to see her sitting on the couch drinking coffee watching the Today Show, is, it's like, doesn't happen. And so to be able to see her kind of being able to relax for a hot second is amazing and I value those moments tremendously.

Sanders: This bonus life.

Jon: Exactly, yeah. And being able to be home, and so her new job actually provides her an extra day off a week, which is, if anybody deserves it, oh my, it's her. And I'm very excited that she'll be able to have some alone time in the house without being pulled in a billion different directions. And that to me is happiness.

Sanders: Is there anything else you'd like to add? Anything we haven't covered that you want to emphasize or highlight for people listening?

Jon: Show empathy and be kind and save lives. It's not difficult. We're not anywhere near where we need to be, but just focus on that. Show empathy, acknowledge when people tell you that they're suffering, that you are sorry. Treat it like any other condition. I'm extremely sorry you're going through this. You're loved. And you proactively be kind to them. You don't ask them what you need. You come home, like I did one day, and my lawn was mowed by my neighbor. I'll never forget it, ever. It took him 15 minutes to do this. I'll never forget it. You know, being able to feel loved when your entire mind is being warped and you're being judged by society. Being able to have people do kind things for you, you'll never forget. And so it's not hard.

Sanders: A beautiful sentiment to end on, just showing up for people we love.

Jon: Not hard. It's all we need to do. 

Sanders: Yeah. Jon: Surround me with those people and we will have a good, a good world and a good life, and that's what we're trying to do.

Sanders: Well, I want to thank you again for not just today, but the, the years now that you have spent with me patiently answering all my questions, indulging the stupid questions, explaining the things that I ask about over and over and over again. I've been so grateful for you and your whole family, and everyone who's who's kind of held my hand as we try to explore some of these ideas. So thank you very much.

Jon: Well, here's my thank you to you. Thank you for paying attention to this. Thank you for making it an amazing online series, video series, podcast series to get the, phenomenal platform to get this message out because everybody should be doing this, and the fact that you are is absolutely commendable, and I, I will be a part of this and whatever you need from me for the rest of my life. Call, text, I'm there.

Sanders: If you or someone you know is facing a suicidal crisis or emotional distress, call or text the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988.

Advances in materials and architecture could lead to silicon-free chip manufacturing thanks to a new type of transistor.

Researchers in China say they have created a new silicon-free transistor that could significantly boost performance while reducing energy consumption. The team says this development represents a new direction for transistor research.

The scientists said that the new transistor could be integrated into chips that could one day perform up to 40% faster than the best existing silicon processors made by U.S. companies like Intel. This is according to a report in the South China Morning Post (SCMP).

Despite that dramatic increase in power, the researchers claim that such chips would also draw 10% less power. The scientists outlined their findings in a new study published Feb. 13 in the journal Nature.

Lead author of the study Hailin Peng, professor of chemistry at Peking University (PKU) in China, told SCMP: "If chip innovations based on existing materials are considered a 'short cut', then our development of 2D material-based transistors is akin to 'changing lanes'."

The efficiency and performance gains are possible thanks to the chip's unique architecture, the scientists said in the paper, specifically the new two-dimensional silicon-free transistor they created. This transistor is a gate-all-around field-effect transistor (GAAFET). Unlike previous leading transistor designs like the fin field-effect transistor (FinFET), a GAAFET transistor wraps sources with a gate on all four sides, instead of just three.

At its most basic level, a transistor is a semiconductor device found in every computer chip. Each transistor has a source, a gate and a drain, which allow the transistor to function as a switch.

The gate is how a transistor controls the flow of current between the source and drain terminals and can act as both a switch and amplifier. Wrapping this gate around all sides of a source (or sources, as some transistors contain multiple) — instead of just three as in conventional transistors — leads to potential improvements in both performance and efficiency.

This is because a fully wrapped source provides better electrostatic control (as there is less energy loss to static electricity discharges) and the potential for higher drive currents and faster switching times.

While the GAAFET architecture isn't itself new, the PKU team's use of bismuth oxyselenide as the semiconductor was, as well as the fact they used it to create an "atomically-thin" two-dimensional transistor.

—Unique transistor 'could change the world of electronics' thanks to nanosecond-scale switching speeds and refusal to wear out

2D bismuth transistors are less brittle and more flexible than traditional silicon, the scientists added in the study. Bismuth provides better carrier mobility —the speed at which electrons can move through it when an electrical field is applied. It also has a high dielectric constant — a measure of a material's ability to store electrical energy — which contributes to the transistor's increased efficiency.

Should this transistor be fitted into a chip that does prove faster than US-made chips by Intel and other companies, it could also allow China to sidestep current restrictions on buying advanced chips and tap into US chip-making by shifting to a wholly different manufacturing process.

NASA Astronauts Finally Return, Seals Hold Their Breath, and Penguin Poop Stresses Out Krill

In this week's news roundup, two NASA astronauts finally return to Earth after nine unexpected months in space, gray seals hold their breath for more than an hour, and penguin poop panics krill.

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Let's kick off the week by catching up on some science news you may have missed.

We'll start out with a space update that we've all been waiting about nine months for…

[CLIP: NASA's SpaceX Crew-9 Re-Entry and Splashdown: “And splashdown Crew-9 is back on earth [cheering]”]

Feltman: Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are finally back on Earth. The two NASA astronauts, who were meant to spend about a week on the International Space Station but have been there since June, splashed down in a SpaceX capsule last Tuesday evening. Welcome home, Butch and Suni!

If you're wondering why it took so long to bring them back after their arrival vehicle's initial technical difficulties, the answer isn't very exciting—it basically came down to scheduling issues. First, NASA had to bump two other astronauts off an upcoming mission so that their return vehicle would have room for Butch and Suni. Once that mission made it to the station, it had to stay put until the next mission came up to relieve the prior crew of their duties. Space is hard, as folks so often say, and multiple ISS missions are bound to mean multiple delays.

In other space news, last week scientists unveiled images of a planetary system 130 light-years away snapped by the James Webb Space Telescope. In an exciting first, the JWST was able to directly capture images of carbon dioxide gas on an exoplanet. That means JWST lives up to its promise of sussing out the chemistry of planetary atmospheres from a distance. These observations suggest that the four planets of the system, known as HR 8799, were likely formed through a process called core accretion. That process starts with the gradual formation of solid cores, which go on to attract gas from inside a protoplanetary disk. It's the same way Saturn and Jupiter formed. At 30 million years old or so, HR 8799 is a baby compared to our roughly 4.6-billion-year-old solar system, so studying these alien worlds could give us a glimpse into what our own gas giants looked like in their early days. And speaking of early days, when it comes to JWST the best is still yet to come. The space telescope was designed to last for at least five years, but the hope is that it can make it more than 20.

Now let's catch up with the Environmental Protection Agency. In last week's news roundup, I outlined EPA head Lee Zeldin's plans to undo heaps of environmental legislation. I also mentioned his purported plan to cut 65 percent of the agency's costs. Last week, thanks to documents reviewed by Democrats on the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, we got a clearer picture of those prospective cost-cutting measures.

The New York Times reported last Monday that the EPA's plan calls for firing up to 1,155 scientists, as well as getting rid of the Office of Research and Development. This is the EPA's main science arm, which conducts research on environmental issues such as pollutants and their effects on humans. Zeldin said in a Fox Business appearance on Tuesday that the EPA was still “working through” cost-cutting decisions. Also on Tuesday, Representatives Valerie Foushee, Deborah Ross and Zoe Lofgren, who are all members of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, put out a joint statement condemning the supposed plans. They argued that, considering the EPA's obligation to use the best-available science in making its decisions, eliminating its main science branch would be illegal. If you like having clean air and water, you might consider calling up your own congressional reps to ask them to take a stand too.

Meanwhile last week President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, a platform he owns, that he was authorizing his administration to “immediately begin producing energy with BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN COAL.”

“Clean coal” is a nebulous term referring to technologies that make coal less polluting than it would be without those technologies. But there's no way of handling coal that makes it a clean form of energy. There are a few facilities that now use carbon capture technology to mitigate coal's impact on the environment, but this technology is expensive and lemme be very clear about this it doesn't turn coal into a zero-carbon energy option. Coal is the most polluting source of energy. It releases heaps of carbon dioxide, contributes to environmental issues like acid rain and smog, and can cause lung disease.

On Truth Social, President Trump claimed that “Environmental Extremists” and “Thugs” had allowed other countries, particularly China, to gain economic advantages over the U.S. by opening new coal plants. While it's true that China has opened new coal plants in recent years, it's worth noting that the country's percentage of electricity generated from coal is actually on the decline.

It's also worth noting that last Wednesday the World Meteorological Organization reported that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are at an 800,000-year high. So yeah, consider calling your reps!

For no particular reason, I could use a little bit of a breather. Let's just talk about animals for the rest of the episode.

First, have you ever wondered how seals avoid drowning? You totally should wonder that cause gray seals, for instance, can hold their breath for more than an hour at a time. A study published last Thursday in Science could help explain how. It turns out that gray seals can seemingly sense how much oxygen is in their blood at any given moment.

Like most mammals, humans don't necessarily react to a lack of oxygen in the air. We're much more sensitive to an uptick in our carbon dioxide levels, which prompts us to breathe more. If a gray seal started to get that panicky air-hunger feeling as soon as the saturation of CO2 in their blood started going up while they were holding their breath, they'd never get anything done. But it seems they've got a trick for that: just cutting out the middleman and sensing oxygen directly.

Scientists tested this by giving seals air with different levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide before the animals went for their dives. The researchers found that seals would dive for longer after inhaling more oxygen-rich air and would cut their dives short after getting less oxygen. When the seals inhaled air with high levels of carbon dioxide, it didn't really change their dive length.

While this study looked at gray seals, they're not even the most accomplished divers in the seal world. The northern elephant seal can dive for up to two hours at a time. It's even possible that this oxygen-sensing trait came from a fairly distant ancestor that is applies to more than just mammals. After all, the emperor penguin can stay underwater for up to 27 minutes.

And speaking of penguins it turns out their poop causes a big ruckus among zooplankton world. In a study published last Thursday in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science, researchers zoomed in on the behavior of Antarctic krill. These tiny, shrimplike creatures are crucial members of the food chain, so they spend a lot of their time trying not to get eaten. Scientists already knew that krill used their sense of smell to react to things like food and pollution, so naturally they thought, “Why not try penguin poo?” Sure enough, when exposed to seawater containing guano in a tank, the little critters swam faster, pivoted direction more, and ate less algae. You might be asking yourself why scientists are interested in this crap. Like literally specifically this crap. But between krills' spot on the food chain and their ability to sequester carbon by eating algae, these little guys can have a big impact on the ocean. Krill are already changing their behaviors due to climate change, sea ice loss and ocean acidification by moving further south.

And if you need a pick-me-up this week, just take a moment to be grateful you aren't on penguin doody duty: researchers had to collect a couple ounces of the stuff for the study, and apparently it smells like rotten shellfish.

That's all for this week's news roundup. We'll be back on Wednesday to talk about the changing science of invasive plants. And stay tuned for a very special video episode on Friday. We're giving you a tour of the cutting-edge lab where MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] scientists study and fabricate stuff at the nanoscale.

Some 5% to 18% of women worldwide suffer from a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormonal disorder that can cause irregular periods, cysts on the ovaries, difficulty with fertility, and has been linked to cardiovascular and metabolic issues.

Despite years of uncertainty about what causes polycystic ovary syndrome, a groundbreaking new study suggests that high hemoglobin levels may play a key role in its development. But the implications go beyond just polycystic ovary syndrome — elevated hemoglobin levels have also been linked to serious health conditions like diabetes and heart disease, as hemoglobin is responsible for transporting oxygen through the blood.

While previous small, limited studies have alluded to some connection between polycystic ovary syndrome  and hemoglobin levels, this new finding brings us closer to understanding a potential cause.

“It seemed like there might be a connection, a missing piece of the puzzle, and we wanted to investigate if hemoglobin could play a role,” said Guiquan Wang, a researcher at Xiamen University in China in an email.

20,602 women with an average age of 31 and who were being treated for fertility issues were included in Wang's study.

Of this population, 3,732 women (roughly 18%), were diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome. When the researchers analyzed their hemoglobin levels, they noted a distinct association, with women with higher levels being more likely to also have polycystic ovary syndrome. Even higher levels within the normal range for hemoglobin, which is between 110 to 150 g/L, were linked to worse odds. For every 10 g/L rise in hemoglobin, women had a 22% greater likelihood of experiencing polycystic ovary syndrome, while also showing high levels of male sex hormones, such as testosterone.

After establishing this correlation, Wang and his team wanted to explore the possibility of a causal link — a direct cause-and-effect relationship between two factors.

They used a statistical method called Mendelian randomization to determine if genetic variants that influence hemoglobin levels were also linked.

“Because these genetic variations are randomly assigned before birth, they help us figure out if the association we saw is truly causal and not just due to other factors,” said Wang. “This analysis confirmed that genetically higher hemoglobin levels increased PCOS risk.” Moreover, higher hemoglobin levels were also linked to higher testosterone levels.

By identifying specific gene variants linked to hemoglobin levels, the researchers were also able to discover particular biological pathways that appeared to be crucial for the link between hemoglobin levels and polycystic ovary syndrome.

One of the key pathways they identified is responsible for how cells react to oxygen levels. Building on this, the researchers found a few important genes that help explain the link between hemoglobin levels and polycystic ovary syndrome. These genes are also connected to the control of testosterone levels, which play a role in the condition.

Next, the researchers wanted to see if any of the implicated genes could make for therapeutic targets. “We used databases to check if these genes are already targeted by existing medications or if they are considered ‘druggable' – meaning it's biologically feasible to develop drugs that can affect them,” explained Wang. “This helps us prioritize which genes might be most promising for developing new treatments.”

Once the researchers identified these genes, they wanted to see if they actually influenced women with polycystic ovary syndrome. When they compared the activity of these genes in the blood and ovary cells of women with and without the condition, they found that the genes were more active in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. They also discovered that the levels of these genes in the blood were connected to higher testosterone levels.

While the researchers want to tease apart the specific biological mechanisms that are likely causing polycystic ovary syndrome, the link between hemoglobin levels and polycystic ovary syndrome  could be more immediately useful for diagnoses.

“Hemoglobin levels, which are routinely measured in blood tests, could potentially be used as an early marker to identify women at higher risk of polycystic ovary syndrome,” said Wang. “This could allow for earlier interventions and preventative strategies.”

Understanding lifestyle factors and investigating therapeutic targets remain other goals for the team. “It's still early days, but our research provides a strong rationale for exploring these therapeutic targets,” concluded Wang.

Fossil fuels powered the industrial revolution. Would aliens need a similar power source to jump-start a technical revolution?

The burning of fossil fuels — coal, oil and gas — propelled humanity into the industrial revolution, remaking civilization in its wake. Gasoline powers many of the cars we drive; coal and natural gas are central to global energy. But if aliens were building their own society, would they have to go down the same path as humanity, relying on fossil fuels to build their advanced civilization? Or could they find an alternative?

To build a modern civilization, aliens would likely need to use a source of energy that's just as abundant as fossil fuels, said Lewis Dartnell, an astrobiologist and author of "The Knowledge: How to Rebuild Our World from Scratch" (Penguin Press, 2014). It would be hard for them to simply bypass the production of fossil fuels, he noted.

Dartnell drew a parallel with humans: In the 18th century, the world entered the industrial revolution by tapping into what appeared to be a limitless source of energy. Coal burned longer and produced more power than wood and charcoal.

"Prior to that, energy was the fundamental limitation on how much you could do," he said. "It would limit how much you could mine and move things around, what you could build, and what you could make."

The question of whether humans could have bypassed fossil fuels to reach alternative energy sources is "somewhat of a chicken-and-egg dilemma," Dartnell told Live Science. For instance, producing solar panels requires silicon, and extracting and refining this element demands a significant amount of energy.

The easiest way for intelligent aliens to create fuel would be to start by burning stuff, like humans did, until they can move to other sources of energy. They could perhaps harness the light of a star or of the kinetic energy of the wind. But wind energy on its own would not create the high temperatures needed for the smelting, forging and casting of metals, which would be needed for industrialization, Dartnell said.

Meanwhile, hydropower would only work if the planet had significant amounts of accessible liquid, which most planets we've found don't possess, added Seth Shostak, an astronomer and director of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute.

Scientists still haven't found a planet with abundant oxygen in its atmosphere, though trace amounts have been found on Mars, Venus and Jupiter's moon Europa. Oxygen is the key ingredient in burning fossil fuels because it enables combustion, which is what releases the energy stored in coal, oil and gas.

Fossil fuels are created from life — they're the transformed remains of plants and animals that lived hundreds of millions of years ago. Dartnell suggested that plate tectonics are a crucial part of the puzzle of how these life forms came to exist. "There's good reason to suspect that in order to have intelligent life on an Earth-like planet, you need to have plate tectonics to regulate the climate for long periods of time," he said.

A 2022 study by researchers at the University of Sydney reported how Earth's tectonic plates move carbon between the deep Earth and the surface, forming what they call a "carbon conveyor belt." This process is key to maintaining Earth's "Goldilocks" climate, making the planet habitable, according to the study. What's more, plate tectonics also results in continental drift and the creation of conditions that produce large amounts of coal, a fossil fuel, he added.



Put another way, plate tectonics can help pave the way for life and create conditions to help it become fossil fuels; it can also create ideal conditions for life that may become intelligent enough to harness those fuels.

"In a sense, you get a two-for-one," Dartnell said. "If you have a planet with active plate tectonics, that regulates the climate, which allows for the evolution of intelligent complex life."

Scientists have yet to find another planet with active plate tectonics. Nor have they found fossil fuels in space. What they have discovered, however, is evidence of fossil fuels' chemical building blocks: hydrogen and carbon. Approximately 75% of the universe's mass is composed of hydrogen, said Shostak. Additionally, scientists have found a field of liquid hydrocarbons on Saturn's moon Titan. Intelligent aliens could, hypothetically, attempt to burn these elements to produce energy.

—How would we give aliens directions to Earth?

—What messages have we sent to aliens?

—What could aliens look like?

Of course, aliens aren't necessarily bound by the same constraints as humans, and our imagination often limits us to thinking in terms of a human timeline. "It's hard for us to predict what the aliens might do," Shostak told Live Science. It's like asking Julius Caesar what he thought the Romans would be doing with oil in 2025, when they were only using small amounts of oil for lamps. "Julius would probably have some ideas, all based on Roman knowledge," he said. "He would completely miss the [mark]. You have to keep that in mind."

An intelligent alien civilization could be nothing like what we expect, Shostak added. While aliens would likely need an abundant energy source to advance their civilization, who's to say what form that energy would take? The answer could lie beyond human understanding.

New Delhi, CPI Rajya Sabha MP P Sandosh Kumar has sought a clarification from the Centre on "discrepancies" in its reply to a question on the first Indian state to implement a science and technology policy and said two different replies were submitted in Parliament on two different occasions. 

In a statement on Monday, the CPI Parliamentary Party said the Centre, in a reply dated July 21, 2022, had stated Gujarat as the first state to implement a science and technology policy. 

However, in reply to another question on March 13, 2025, it acknowledged that Kerala was the first state to introduce a science and technology innovation policy. 

"In response to an unstarred question answered on July 21, 2022, the Union government stated that Gujarat was the first state to introduce a science, technology and innovation policy in 2018. However, in a subsequent answer to another unstarred question on March 13, 2025, the government correctly acknowledged that Kerala was the first state to introduce a science and technology policy in 1974, under the leadership of then CPI leader and Kerala chief minister C Achutha Menon," the CPI Parliamentary Party said. 





"Providing misleading data in Parliament is a serious issue, especially on a subject as crucial as science policy, which plays a vital role in shaping the country's education, research and technological progress," the CPI Parliamentary Party said. 

It added that Kumar had formally demanded a 30-minute discussion in the Rajya Sabha to allow the Centre to clarify its position. 

"The discussion will also provide an opportunity for a broader debate on the state of scientific research, innovation and policy implementation in India, more than 50 years after Kerala set the benchmark," according to the CPI Parliamentary Party. 

The demand was supported by CPI MP PP Suneer and the Samajwadi Party's Javed Ali Khan. 

"We insist that the government rectify its erroneous statements and ensure that Parliament is furnished with factually correct information in the future. The CPI reaffirms its commitment to scientific progress and urges the Union government to take the matter seriously, acknowledging Kerala's pioneering role in establishing India's first state-level science and technology policy," Kumar said.

The basketball transfer portal opens officially on Monday and there are already a handful of Virginia Tech players are are going to be in it. Last week, wings Jaydon Young, Rodney Brown, Jr., Patrick Wessler, and Brandon Rechsteiner. Young has already had a handful of schools reach out to the sophomore who raised his stock in the second half of the season with some strong offensive performances.

Young reportedly has heard from Davidson, Missouri, Loyola Chicago, East Carolina, Arizona, and more, according to The Portal Report. It's not surprising that he's heard from that many schools and he'll be missed next season in Blacksburg. Sadly, these won't be the last players entering the portal for Virginia Tech.

After squeaking out a 5-4 win on Friday afternoon, the Hokies dropped Game 2 on Saturday, 12-8, but Virginia Tech won Game 3 on Sunday afternoon, 11-4, to pick up their first ACC series win of the season to improve to 16-8 overall and 4-5 in the conference. It was also career win No. 600 for head coach John Szefc.

In 1966, computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum created one of the first-ever chatbots, ELIZA, and designed it to function as a psychotherapist. Nearly six decades later, ChatGPT's parent company, OpenAI, claims that over 400 million people rely on the chatbot as their digital companion for studying, research, writing, and more. 

With ChatGPT becoming more accessible and offering versions with up-to-date internet access, reports suggest that more users are abandoning search engines and turning to the chatbot for their search needs. A survey conducted by TechRadar's parent organization, Future, in December 2024 found that 27 percent of U.S. respondents said they have used or are continuously using chatbots instead of search engines. Bloomberg also reported on early adopters swapping traditional search engines for chatbots like ChatGPT, citing convenience and time efficiency as motivations.

However, as expectations surge, a question arises: Can ChatGPT be trusted to deliver accurate information about recent events? 

According to recent BBC research, AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot often struggled with factual inaccuracies and distortions when summarizing BBC news stories. The study found that 51 percent of chatbot responses to questions about breaking news contained significant factual errors. OpenAI's ChatGPT help center also warns about its tendency to hallucinate, "It (ChatGPT) can even make up things like quotes or citations, so don't use it as your only source for research." 

Despite these warnings, Logically Facts has found examples of social media users citing screenshots from ChatGPT as credible evidence in online conversations about news events.

In July 2024, 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana murdered three young girls and attempted to kill 10 others in the British city of Southport, sparking far-right, anti-immigration protests fueled by false claims about his background. 

By November, users on X had shared screenshots of ChatGPT-generated allegations that Rudakubana's father was involved in the killing of Tutsis during the Rwandan genocide and that Prime Minister Keir Starmer had defended him in a 2003 asylum case. One screenshot garnered significant attention, amassing 200,000 views. However, both claims are unsubstantiated by reliable evidence.

When we asked ChatGPT about Alphonse Rudakubana's participation in the Rwandan genocide, the chatbot referenced the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. However, according to Tribunal documents, Alphonse Nteziryayo, not Alphonse Rudakubana, is the name of the individual convicted for crimes during the genocide. Several other U.N. trial transcripts mention persons with the same first or last name. However, none of them were Alphonse Rudakubana. 

Secondly, while Keir Starmer did represent a Rwandan national in a 2003 human rights case, the individual was a 42-year-old woman with no known connection to Alphonse Rudakubana. There is no evidence that Starmer had ever represented Alphonse as a lawyer. A spokesperson for the prime minister also told the Daily Mail that the claim was untrue in November 2024.

We conducted an experiment to evaluate ChatGPT's tendency to generate misinformation about four recent events: Axel Rudakubana's father's alleged ties to the Rwandan genocide, tennis player Jannik Sinner's doping ban, claims that Trump called for a ban on carmine, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We tested a total of 102 queries across three models available for free: GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, and OpenAI o3-mini. 

GPT-4o is the most advanced, with browsing access but limited free prompts. GPT-4o mini is a lighter version intended for everyday use with restricted internet access. The o3-mini is primarily designed for coding and reasoning tasks. 

We found that GPT-4o had the lowest error rate at about eight percent, while GPT-4o-mini had the highest error rate at 61 percent, frequently producing hallucinations. 

GPT-o3 mini had an error rate of 33 percent. However, the o3-mini was less prone to errors because it could not answer news-related questions, instead guiding us to check news outlets for recent information.

When asking the chatbot whether Keir Starmer had represented Alphonse Rudakubana in court, we could generate similar responses to those shown in screenshots posted on X using ChatGPT 4o-mini. In contrast, when asked the same question, the 4o version demonstrated greater accuracy, provided references, and identified that these were debunked rumors.

Through the experiment, we deduced that ChatGPT-4o has internet browsing capabilities since it provides links to recently published online articles. However, the sources it chooses are not always reliable. During our experiment, we found that 47 percent of GPT-4o-generated answers cited sources like social media posts and Wikipedia. When asked about Alphonse Rudakubana, GPT-4o cited British conspiracy site The Exposé. 

We contacted OpenAI to comment on whether ChatGPT's guardrails on answering queries about breaking news have changed and what limitations, if any, are placed on the chatbot to prevent it from generating misinformation. We have not received a reply.

Despite more people turning to chatbots for details on current events, experts told us that ChatGPT may not be designed for factual reliability. In an interview with Logically Facts, Dan Brown, a computer science professor at the University of Waterloo, explained why OpenAI's chatbot struggles with breaking news queries. "This feels like a fundamentally flawed use of these kinds of devices, so it's not surprising that they're struggling to get a successful output," Brown said. 

He explained that the bot can present false information when encountering conflicting sources, and unlike humans, ChatGPT lacks an understanding of truth. "Its primary function is to generate linguistically coherent responses rather than ensure factual accuracy," he told Logically Facts.

Using ChatGPT to retrieve facts and details on recent events when truthfulness is not its primary goal can create a nurturing ground for spreading misinformation. "Unlike search engines, which provide links to multiple sources, chatbots generate direct answers, often without citation," explained McKenzie Sadeghi, an AI and Foreign Influence editor for NewsGuard, a company that provides reliability ratings of news outlets and platforms. "This makes it easier for misinformation to spread because users may not cross-check AI-generated chatbot responses against reputable sources."

One factor contributing to ChatGPT hallucinations is its training cut-off date. While the GPT-4o version has up-to-date access to the internet, the GPT-4o mini's cut-off supposedly predates the Southport attack and, therefore, lacks awareness of how its responses relate to these murders and the importance of their social implications.

However, the chatbot's information sometimes contradicts its stated cut-off date. For example, when asked whether Russia has agreed to Ukraine's 30-day ceasefire, GPT-4o mini hallucinates an answer instead of stating that it does not have access to recent information. We found that the chatbot was unaware of its training data cut-off date and provided inconsistent answers when asked about its knowledge date.



GPT4o-mini's alleged knowledge cut-off date is October 2023, yet it provides false information on recent events. (Source: GPT4o and GPT4o-mini/Screenshots)

Sadeghi said our findings correlate with NewsGuard research. "We do monthly audits of these chatbots, and we found that their training data cutoff is very inconsistent with their responses," she told Logically Facts.

"They'll say, 'My knowledge cutoff date is October 2023.' Yet, in their responses, they somehow know that Trump is president, which is related to events in 2024 and 2025. So, it does muddy the waters and get confusing about how much source knowledge these chatbots have," Sadeghi added.

NewsGuard also found that chatbots tend to generate answers based on fake websites that pollute the quality of online discourse. In an email to Logically Facts, Sadeghi wrote, "So far, we have identified 1,254 AI-generated news and information sites operating with little to no human oversight. These websites have been found to advance false claims related to celebrity death hoaxes, fabricated events, and articles presenting old events as if they just occurred."

Since chatbots with internet access draw information from what is available online, they are vulnerable targets for disinformation campaigns. A recent NewsGuard audit uncovered that the Moscow-based "Pravda" network, consisting of around 150 websites, has published 3.6 million pro-Kremlin articles in 2024, targeting 49 countries. Pravda manipulates AI data by flooding the internet with false narratives, causing chatbots to reproduce Russian disinformation in their outputs.

When asked whether people should be dissuaded from using chatbots to retrieve information on breaking news, Sadeghi said: "They [chatbots] should be used with a very cognizant understanding of the issues and limitations at play here." She pointed out that "at this point, the user has a lot of burden and responsibility to verify and cross-verify the information they're receiving from chatbot outputs."

Trimble's establishment of Kirby-Smith Machinery as the first Trimble Technology Outlet in the U.S. marks a strategic distribution expansion with several potential benefits. This partnership enables Trimble to penetrate markets previously difficult to access by making their grade control technology available to users of Komatsu, Takeuchi, and Hamm equipment across Texas and Oklahoma.

The introduction of the Trimble Works Subscription model represents a shift toward predictable recurring revenue rather than one-time sales. Subscription models typically improve customer lifetime value while providing more stable cash flow. This follows the broader technology industry trend of transitioning from product sales to service-based revenue models.

By enabling equipment-agnostic technology deployment, Trimble addresses a critical market need. The statement that customers have been requesting easier access to Trimble technology "for years" suggests pent-up demand that this partnership can now satisfy. The strategy also aligns with contractors' operational reality of managing mixed equipment fleets.

While this partnership appears strategically sound, the announcement lacks quantifiable metrics regarding the expected financial impact. The  geographic scope (select locations in Texas and Oklahoma) indicates a measured rollout approach rather than a transformative nationwide launch. Investors should monitor future earnings reports for subscription adoption metrics and expansion of this distribution model to additional regions and equipment types.

    Service provider Trading Technologies said market data issues for the London Metal Exchange (LME) reported earlier on Monday appeared to have been resolved, though it was still doing additional checks to ensure stability.

Several LME member firms reported prices missing on Monday on LMEtrader, provided directly by Trading Technologies, and Standard TT GUI (graphical user interface) screens, including carry prices, the LME said.

Apart from Trading Technologies, there were no reports of issues with any other independent software vendor (ISV) providers, the exchange said.

 The LME, the world's oldest and largest market for industrial metals, rolled out "LMEselect v10," its new trading platform, to enhance its electronic markets on Monday.

"We are pleased to confirm that the LMEselect v10 trading platform and LMEsource v4 market data platform launched as planned and are currently running as expected," the LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. 388, said.

Achieves International Recognition with HIMSS Award for Excellence in Smart Healthcare

TAOYUAN, March 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As the demand for surgical precision and faster patient recovery continues to grow, smart healthcare has achieved another major breakthrough. Since 2006, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital has pioneered the use of the Da Vinci Robotic Surgical Systems. By the end of 2024, the hospital had performed over 12,000 robotic surgeries, accounting for one-sixth of Taiwan's robotic procedures and cementing its leadership in the field. With its technical expertise and clinical achievements, Chang Gung is steering Taiwan into a new era of minimally invasive surgery worldwide with its robust healthcare system.



Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Receives HIMSS Recognition for Pioneering Excellence in Smart Healthcare

Chang Gung' s healthcare system has once again captured international attention for its advancements in smart healthcare. At the recent HIMSS (Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society) conference held in Las Vegas, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou became the first medical institution in Taiwan to achieve a perfect score in the HIMSS Digital Health Indicator (DHI). The assessment, which measures the digital maturity of healthcare institutions, evaluates "Interoperability", "Person-Centered Healthcare", "Predictive Analytics", and "Governance and Workforce". The accolade highlights Chang Gung's effective integration of smart surgery, data management, and medical AI technologies.

New Advances in Single-Port Surgery: Opening New Frontiers in the Treatment of Five Major Cancer Types

In 2022, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital became the first medical institution in Taiwan to pass U.S. expert review and obtain approval from the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA), enabling the launch of clinical trials for Single-Port Da Vinci Robotic Surgery. This cutting-edge technology focuses on innovative treatments for five major cancer types: breast, prostate, rectal and lung, as well as for thoracic mediastinal tumors. By utilizing only a single incision and combining 3D high-resolution imaging with remote control, the technology aims to minimize trauma, enhance precision, and accelerate recovery.

Outstanding Cross-Departmental Collaboration: Delivering Comprehensive Patient Care

Chang Gung Memorial Hospital exemplifies the strengths of a leading medical center through its integrated cross-departmental efforts. For instance, the plastic surgery and breast surgery departments have joined forces to advance breast and nerve reconstruction for breast cancer patients. Additionally, the thoracic surgery and plastic surgery teams have jointly completed sympathetic nerve reconstruction (SNR) surgeries, effectively treating hyperhidrosis. These interdisciplinary collaborations provide patients with holistic treatment options and highlight the potential of smart healthcare in various applications.

Establishing Asia's Premier Robotic Surgery Training Hub

In 2020, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital signed a memorandum of understanding with Intuitive Surgical Inc., the developer of the Da Vinci Surgical System. In 2023, the hospital and the medical equipment maker joined forces to establish the Da Vinci Surgery Training Center at the Chang Gung Surgical Training Academy And Research Center (STARC). To date, the center has hosted 43 advanced training sessions, attracting medical professionals from around the world to observe and learn. The initiative is gradually developing into a hub for robotic surgery education in the Asia-Pacific region.

Future Vision: Using AI Analysis Systems to Create a New Era of Digital Surgery

Looking ahead, the Chang Gung medical team plans to deploy digital surgery analysis systems developed by global leaders in robotic surgery. Utilizing big data and AI for clinical decision support, combined with cutting-edge medical devices, the hospital is enhancing the efficacy of smart surgery. The approach aims to improve medical outcomes and patient recovery, reflecting the hospital's commitment to patient-centered care.

The Providence health system has an internal service available to its 51 hospitals and other rural and community hospitals in its eight-state service area, bringing specialists and other high-demand providers virtually to the hospital bedside.

This acute care telemedicine service – built by and for Providence – seamlessly integrates with clinical workflows and processes to provide quality care to any hospitalized patient in the Providence hospital ecosystem.

THE CHALLENGE

Anyone caring for critically ill patients knows that access to specialists and high-demand providers within hospitals is essential to achieving good outcomes and supporting patients and caregivers. Scheduled and on-demand access to neurologists, infectious disease specialists, hospitalists, intensivists and psychiatrists is proven to address these goals. However, the workforce crisis is making the job of staffing to need a tough battle.

The problem is three pronged – revolving around provider supply, demand and distribution of clinical expertise, said Sherene Schlegel, RN, COO and CNO, virtual care and digital health, at Providence.

"First, on the supply side, we have significant shortfalls in the number of physicians who can treat specific conditions due to a broad set of factors – but the aging population of our current physicians and burnout are playing a significant role," she explained.

"Nationally, 41% of ICU physicians have reported a high level of burnout, 55% of physicians will be age 75 or older by 2036, and more than half of infectious disease residency training programs go unfilled," she continued. 

"So, this problem is real. On the demand side, aging patient populations and new treatment options are increasing the demand for specialists. In fact, most hospital stays require at least one specialty consultation."

In such a supply-and-demand constrained environment, the distribution of physicians – where they are geographically in the world – starts to make a tremendous difference. In the acute care environment, a strong telemedicine program can get excellent specialists and high-demand providers to the bedside of any hospitalized patient in a service area, she added.

That's why the health system has been developing the Providence Virtual Acute Care program over the last 10 or so years.

PROPOSAL

"Here at Providence, we have been at the forefront of delivering virtual acute care services since the beginning – so we've been developing and learning what makes an effective program," Schlegel said.

"For us, our high-quality, mission-based care is non-negotiable – so we wanted to develop a program that focused on enabling our own Providence providers to be available at the patient's bedside within the hospital," she continued. "Having our virtual team be Providence providers – who meet the high quality, credentialing and governance requirements used across our system and who know our internal systems, protocols and workflows – was essential."

The virtual providers are colleagues of those at the hospital site, and staff believe that makes a tremendous difference.

"Over the years, we've also learned a lot about the delicate balance that exists between operational scalability and hospital-specific requirements," Schlegel noted. "To make the program operationally feasible, we needed to take advantage of the economies of scale that a health system like Providence has.

"With 51 hospitals and hundreds of referral hospitals within our service area, program scalability is both possible and essential," she continued. "But we also are keenly aware each hospital brings its own unique challenges that must be embraced through the program."

Utilization, staffing and recruiting preferences and constraints, the nuances of the community served, and the services available to care for them – all have an impact on how care decisions are made. Providence needed to assure it was able to consider the hospital-specific requirements as well.

"For these reasons, national telemedicine services really fall short – so for us, developing a Providence-specific virtual acute telemedicine program was essential," Schlegel stated.

MEETING THE CHALLENGE

Over the years, the Providence Virtual Acute Care service has evolved into a highly valuable, comprehensive and scalable program that is meeting the needs of the health system's hospitals and other hospitals in the referral networks.

There are six core components to the program.

First, Providence providers. The service starts with providers.

"We don't just integrate with Providence, we are Providence," Schlegel explained. "Our service was built by and for our hospitals and referral hospitals, and our providers are Providence employees who meet or exceed our standards for employment and service levels. 

"We are full-service teams focused on delivering mission-based care and helping our colleagues deliver on their patient care goals," she added. " We use the same systems they use and are focused on providing our unique Providence brand of mission-based care."

Next, clinical quality programs and analytics. Staff layer on top of all of this a standards-based quality program that incorporates ongoing monitoring for adherence and reporting against established KPIs – including quality of patient care, programs and physicians.

Then, customized clinical design. The hospital-specific clinical design process recognizes the unique service availability, referral preferences and operational norms of a hospital and optimizes workflows accordingly. The system is deeply integrated into existing workflow, processes and operations, while adhering to and supporting Providence standards of care, governance models and mission.

Next, one-call-for-all service. "Our unprecedented 'one-call-for-all,' real-time patient support manages immediate action for any hospital requirement or issue," Schlegel explained. "Our Digital Access Center ensures clinicians and stakeholders get the crucial assistance they need to perform at their best. This includes a 24/7 virtual response team, stakeholder support and service levels."

Further, cross-Providence exam technology.

"We are equipped with high-definition cameras and integrated peripheral devices that allow the facilitation of comprehensive, remote examinations," Schlegel noted. "Our exam hardware and software are standardized across Providence to deliver a price, support and experience advantage.

"We use highly reliable bidirectional audio/video technology, including carts, wall-mounted units and tablets, as well as examination tools such as Bluetooth-enabled stethoscopes and peripheral devices – delivered at a price advantage through cross-Providence, volume-based contracts," she continued. 

"Our clinician portal supports request triage and case assignment, provides safety and quality controls to ensure appropriate licensing and credentialing, as well as manages scheduling using Providence Epic instances and service-line standards."

And finally, the Telemedicine Resource Center. "Last, we provide shared services that support our hospitals as they transition toward a virtual care augmented hospital," she said. "We provide learning and education opportunities for every level and function, helping the organizations we serve to manage the differences and complexities of telehealth operations."

RESULTS

Virtual care at Providence is proving to be an important component of the health system's care delivery. Today, the health system has more than 250 virtually enabled acute care clinicians delivering service in more than 100 sites in eight states, and delivers more than a million patient encounters every year.

The Providence Virtual Acute Care services has evolved from tele-stroke alone to eight offerings including:

The tele-stroke service line, live in more than 80 sites, serving more than 16,000 patients every year with an average response time of 2.4 minutes.

The emergent tele-neurology offering, serving more than 1,000 patients every year at 28 sites, providing 24/7 neurology coverage to hard-to-recruit service areas.

The tele-neurohospitalist service line, offering 24/7 access to board-certified neurologists at eight sites, reducing transfers and improving patient outcomes.

The tele-EEG service line, live at 12 sites, enabling EEGs at sites without machines to be conducted and reach within 24 hours and stat requests to be read within two hours.

The telepsychiatry service line, live at more than 40 sites, with an average response time of less than seven minutes. One in three patients are rapidly triaged and sent to lower acuity care.

The tele-critical-care service line, which has decreased risk-adjusted mortality, decreased length of stay and reduced transfer rates.

The tele-hospitalist service line, which has demonstrated reduced ED wait times of more than 6-times at partner hospitals, contributed to decreased length of stay, and offers cross-cover resolution times of less than 10 minutes.

The recently launched tele-infectious-disease service line, offering same-day consults 365 days per year; early infectious disease consultation can reduce length of stay by up to 29% and reduce 30-day readmissions by 8%.

ADVICE FOR OTHERS

"I would emphasize the critical role virtual care plays in mitigating clinician shortages and allowing patients to have access to care regardless of their geographic location," Schlegel said. "Virtual care not only alleviates staffing constraints but also enhances patient outcomes by providing timely access to expert care – and is incredibly meaningful to families who are able to keep their loved ones close to home.

"I don't believe flexibility is a trend – I think it's the new currency of hospital employment," she continued. "When done right it's good for patients, good for hospitals, good for administrators and good for our clinicians. That said, embracing flexibility should not mean a compromise to care quality. It's important to figure out a way to both have scalability and deliver quality care. Through many years of learning, we've figured out a model to do both."

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel joins 'America Reports' to discuss the Department of Government Efficiency's audit of Medicare and studies suggesting some Americans could get healthier by rejoining the work force.

EXCLUSIVE: A Medicaid and Medicare fraud crackdown is anticipated with a bipartisan congressional proposal to check Social Security Administration death records.

The legislation, dubbed the Medicare and Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act, would mandate state governments to see if the Social Security Death Master Files show physicians who are still considered part of the government programs meant for seniors and low-income Americans. The check is meant to ensure that the doctor's National Provider Identifier will not be used by bad actors to commit fraud.  

"We must eliminate and be proactive against fraud within Medicaid and Medicare to protect the programs for those who truly need it. I'm proud to co-lead the bipartisan Medicare and Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act to advocate for access to quality health care for Americans who rely on these programs." Rep. Gabe Evans, R-Colo., who is running the bill with Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

Legislation under the same name was introduced by former Rep. Mike Garcia, R-Calif., and Peters last year. The bill passed the House and was referred to the Senate Finance Committee, but no further action was taken after that point.  

"Fraud in Medicare and Medicaid hurts the rightful beneficiaries of those programs and all taxpayers," Peters said in a statement at the time. 

"Our bipartisan bill will prevent one of the most egregious forms of fraud in our healthcare system. As we work to put our country on a better fiscal path and tackle our enormous debt, we must do everything we can to stop taxpayer dollars from being misspent," the congressman added.

The legislation's introduction comes as there is heightened scrutiny on the program at both the state and federal levels. In Evans' home state of Colorado, $7.3 million was given to insurance companies to care for deceased Medicaid recipients, The Denver Post reported.

Meanwhile, California is facing scrutiny for a $9.5 billion price tag for its Medicaid affiliate, Medi-Cal, despite originally only expecting it to cost $6 billion.

While California Gov. Gavin Newsom did say that illegal immigrants now being able to enroll in the program is part of the issue, he argued that the Golden State is like Colorado, Pennsylvania and Indiana when it comes to higher costs for operating the program across the board.

In fiscal year 2024, there were $54.3 billion in "improper payments" for Medicare and $31.1 billion for Medicaid, according to the Government Accountability Office. Meanwhile, the Department of Government Efficiency has reportedly looked into government healthcare program spending.

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services will delay the effective date of two final rules that were expected to go into effect on Friday, March 21. 

By extending the Expansion of Buprenorphine Treatment via Telemedicine Encounter and Continuity of Care via Telemedicine for Veterans Affairs Patients final rules – first promulgated Jan. 17 – to Dec. 31, the agencies can spend more time considering comments they have received. 

WHY IT MATTERS

The two rules were scheduled to become final on Feb. 18, but following a Jan. 20 regulatory freeze by the new administration, the agencies initially delayed their effective dates by a month. 

The expansion rule would have permanently allowed virtual care providers to prescribe new patients a six-month supply of buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder. After the six-month mark, the rule requires patients to see a provider in person.

The long-awaited clarity on prescribing controlled substances via telemedicine included establishing three special registries for practitioners and platforms to balance patient access with safeguards against misuse. 

The DEA has had a responsibility to create a telehealth prescribing registry under the 2018 Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act, known as the SUPPORT Act.

Healthcare organizations raised concerns about the registries proposed in the DEA's final rule, arguing that they could limit telemedicine access and impose burdensome restrictions. One concern has been limiting virtual prescribing access to terminally ill patients in hospice care.

In response to a request, the DEA said it received 32 new comments since February. 

The Alliance for Connected Care asked U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi last month to intervene on the DEA's e-prescribing rules and urged broader telehealth access, stating that the draft special telehealth registries should be tossed out.

THE LARGER TREND

Congress and telehealth industry groups have urged the DEA and HHS to jointly extend prescribing flexibilities allowed under the original COVID-19 public health emergency since it was initially set to expire.

The agencies agreed to a third temporary extension of virtual prescribing for controlled substances allowed under the original COVID-19 public health emergencies in November.

With this new postponement of the rules' effective dates, telehealth providers are back to an end-of-year deadline. 

ON THE RECORD

"The Department of Justice wishes to further postpone the effective dates for the purpose of further reviewing any questions of fact, law and policy that the rules may raise," said HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and Heather Achbach, the DEA's Federal Register liaison officer, Monday in their joint notice on the new postponement.

For Christian Rich (MS '24, BIO), the path to building a clinic in Kenya began with a game of basketball.

During high school Rich had the opportunity to play for the Mountain Stars Basketball Club, a non-profit organization that brings American and African basketball players together for games and service-oriented aid missions. Although Rich no longer plays for Mountain Stars, the love of service he developed during his trips to Africa inspired him to continue building on the connection he shares with the people of Kenya.

“Every trip the Mountain Stars team participated in included donating healthcare supplies,” Rich shares. “It became clear to me that this is one of the biggest unfulfilled needs faced by the African people. From there, I saw such a natural bridge between my love for Africa and my love for medicine.”

Building on that bridge, Rich is now working closely with Avery Zentner, a pre-health student at Utah Tech University, to spearhead a transformative healthcare initiative in Kenya. Collaborating with the Kilifi County Government and Koins for Kenya, Rich and Zentner aim to build a much-needed medical clinic in the village of Shaka. The clinic will address the urgent healthcare gaps in the area, where residents currently walk up to nine miles to access basic medical care.

Once a thriving center of commerce, particularly in salt, the village now stands as a shadow of its former self. After heavy rains swept the salt away, the disaster became part of the village's identity and it was renamed Shaka, symbolizing unexpected challenges. As a village still on the mend, Shaka residents face constant challenges. They have no immediate access to medical care, having to walk 3 hours to the nearest clinic. For many, the trek for medical assistance becomes a perilous gamble, with lives lost on the way due to the time-sensitive nature of their ailments.

Understanding Shaka's unique challenges allowed Rich and Zentner to plan accordingly. “We want to create an outpatient clinic,” Rich explains. “We will help construct the facility, supply it with equipment and an initial stock of supplies—such as bandages and medication—and then we'll step back and the county government will take on the responsibility of employing personnel and running the clinic.”

Rich and Zentner credit Koins for Kenya as one of the essential driving forces behind their project's success. Originally connecting with the organization through the Mountain Stars Basketball team, Koins for Kenya responded enthusiastically when Rich and Zentner proposed their plan to build a clinic. “Koins for Kenya is the reason that this is all possible,” Zentner explains. “Leah, our liaison, is able to communicate with the African government, which in turn supports us with the electricity and employees we need. She was the one who traveled to the different villages to see which one could benefit the most from the creation of a clinic, and ultimately, she decided to go with a village called Shaka.”

Construction began in February of 2025, and Rich and Zentner are optimistic that this clinic will serve as a cornerstone for a region on the path to recovery. They plan to arrive in Kenya in May to assist with the completion of the clinic's construction. However, their vision does not stop there. The clinic will have the necessary infrastructure to grow into a full maternity wing or birthing unit in the future. In other parts of Africa, even small interventions—like providing prenatal vitamins to expectant mothers—have led to significant improvements. Rich and Zentner are hopeful that this clinic will create lasting positive change in Shaka.

As Rich and Zentner reflect on their experiences, both students express a deep sense of gratitude. Zentner recalls the uncertainty the group faced as they worked toward their ambitious fundraising goals, followed by the joy they felt when they achieved them this past December.

“There's no way we could've done that on our own,” Zentner says. “Through God it is possible to do these hard things in college. It's possible to raise money for people who are in need.”

Reflecting on the way the project has strengthened his love for service, Rich adds, “This experience touches you in a way that's hard to put into words.” Though Shaka's road to recovery will be long and arduous, it is thanks to students like Rich and Zentner that hope is being reintroduced into this resilient community. Rich is a great example of a student embracing BYU's motto of “go forth to serve.”

Hospitals across the U.S. are seeing steady financial performance, driven by increased patient volumes, even as high expenses remain a persistent challenge, according to Kaufman Hall's January 2025 National Hospital Flash Report.

The report, based on data from more than 1,300 hospitals, provides a snapshot of hospital revenue, expenses and margins at the start of the year.

Despite a continued rise in drug and supply costs, inpatient revenue grew at a faster rate than outpatient revenue, signaling a shift in hospital utilization patterns.

"The growth in volumes and inpatient revenue in January may be related in part to seasonal factors from the flu and other respiratory illnesses," Erik Swanson, managing director and group leader of data and analytics at Kaufman Hall, told HealthcareFinanceNews.

Cost growth slows, expenses remain high

One of the key findings of the report is that cost growth has slowed compared to previous years, offering some financial relief to hospitals. However, expenses, particularly in labor and pharmaceuticals, remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels.

"Hospitals are seeing some relief from extreme cost spikes, but drug and supply chain expenses continue to be a major concern," Swanson said. "Many organizations are joining group purchasing organizations, seeking generic substitutions, or exploring biosimilar drugs to control spending."

Hospitals are also optimizing their workforce to reduce costs while maintaining quality care.

"Some health systems have developed in-house staffing agencies to meet changes in patient demand without relying on third-party agencies," Swanson said.

He added other organizations are focusing on workforce optimization techniques to better align staffing levels with patient demand.

Uncompensated care rises amid Medicaid disenrollments

A growing concern for hospitals is the increase in uncompensated care, which includes bad debt and charity care. The report noted the recent uptick may be linked to Medicaid disenrollments in 2023 and 2024.
 
"Recent increases in bad debt and charity care may be related in part to Medicaid disenrollments," Swanson said. "Hospitals need to prepare for potential further increases depending on changes in Medicaid policy."

Hospitals that manage all their departments close to financial performance benchmarks tend to fare better.

"High-performing hospitals tend to manage their departments efficiently, suggesting that focusing on departmental performance and simplifying administrative processes can help mitigate financial risks," Swanson explained.

Strategies to improve hospital margins

With hospitals still facing tight margins, shared services allocations are becoming an area of focus.

Managing these costs is challenging for hospitals of all sizes, with wide variations in how systems allocate expenses.

"The total spend for shared services functions is substantial and growing, and hospitals must take a proactive approach to cost control," Swanson said.

Hospitals are also working on improving clinical documentation to ensure accurate coding and reimbursement.

"Organizations are investing in clinical documentation improvement programs to make sure they are coding patients appropriately and getting reimbursed correctly," Swanson said.

As hospitals move forward, balancing cost containment with the need to expand services will be critical.

While inpatient revenue growth is encouraging, high labor costs, supply expenses, and rising uncompensated care remain key challenges.

"Hospitals must continue to refine their financial strategies," Swanson said. "Managing labor efficiently, leveraging group purchasing, and optimizing shared services will be crucial in maintaining financial stability."

Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of 13 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against other best healthcare dividend stocks to invest in.

The US healthcare sector has been at the forefront since the emergence of COVID-19 in 2020, leading to a significant transformation in the industry. The rise of telehealth, virtual consultations, and technological advancements has reshaped the way healthcare services are delivered.

Over the past two decades, the healthcare sector has expanded considerably in relation to the broader economy, as reflected in its growing share of gross domestic product (GDP). According to a report by CNBC, in 2003, healthcare spending made up 15.7% of US GDP, increasing by approximately 1.7 percentage points over the next decade to reach 17.4% in 2013. Today, it is estimated at around 18.4% of GDP, and projections from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services suggest it could rise to 20% by 2030. This steady increase is driven by several factors, including rising demand for healthcare services, advancements in medical technology, and escalating costs. The aging population, particularly as baby boomers retire, has significantly increased the need for medical care, while longer life expectancies have resulted in prolonged healthcare utilization. In addition, the prevalence of chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity has contributed to rising costs. The latest breakthroughs in diagnostics, treatments, and pharmaceuticals—though beneficial—often come with higher expenses, further fueling the sector's expansion.

The healthcare industry's share of the overall economy has expanded, with healthcare companies experiencing faster revenue growth than the broader market in the past five years. During this period, healthcare sector revenues have increased by nearly 61%, compared to just over 38% growth for the broader market as a whole, as reported by CNBC. However, despite this strong revenue performance, the healthcare sector has lagged behind the broader market index, which has been driven by the rapid expansion of the technology sector.

The healthcare sector faced a turbulent year in 2024. During the first half, investors gravitated toward industries such as technology and communication services, particularly those linked to the growing influence of AI, leaving healthcare stocks trailing behind. However, as the market rally broadened in the second half of the year, healthcare stocks saw some recovery, though certain segments continued to struggle with lingering supply-and-demand imbalances from the pandemic. Beyond these challenges, fundamental issues and policy uncertainties created additional obstacles for parts of the sector. While some regulatory pressures may ease with the incoming administration, others—such as drug pricing concerns—are expected to remain a persistent issue.

On a positive note, innovation remained robust throughout the year. Biotech companies delivered a series of encouraging clinical updates while growing enthusiasm for new treatments targeting obesity and diabetes contributed to an increase in pharmaceutical firms' market valuations. A Fidelity report suggested that the healthcare sector is well-positioned for growth in 2025. The industry benefits from strengthening business fundamentals, such as rising cash flows, and encompasses a diverse range of segments that offer a blend of defensive stability and growth potential, making it appealing across different market conditions.

The healthcare sector is also attracting attention due to its rising dividend payouts. In the third quarter of 2024, total dividends distributed by the global healthcare industry reached $25.7 billion, up from $18.7 billion in Q3 2018, reflecting steady growth in shareholder returns, according to a report by Janus Henderson.

For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of Q4 2024 and picked healthcare dividend companies. From that list, we chose healthcare stocks with a strong track record of paying dividends to shareholders, which makes them resilient in the current environment. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the hedge fund investors owning stakes in them, according to Insider Monkey's database of Q4 2024.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is an American multinational pharmaceutical company, headquartered in New Jersey. The company's substantial investment in research and development, along with its strategic emphasis on cardiovascular and rare diseases, reinforces confidence in its long-term revenue growth. In addition, the healthcare sector's resilience during economic downturns enhances Merck's attractiveness as an investment, as the demand for essential medications remains stable regardless of market conditions.

Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) reported strong financial performance, with revenue increasing 7% year-over-year to $15.6 billion. The company has strengthened its presence in specialty pharmaceuticals and oncology, with Keytruda remaining a cornerstone of its cancer treatment portfolio and a key contributor to revenue growth. Merck's solid market position has enabled it to maintain consistent cash flow, supporting its commitment to shareholder returns.

For the full year, Keytruda sales jumped 18% from the previous year, reaching $29.5 billion. The drug is expected to generate more than $35 billion in revenue by 2028 before its patent expires, further cementing Merck's leadership in the immunotherapy market.

Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)'s quarterly dividend comes in at $0.81 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.44%. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list with 14 consecutive years of dividend growth under its belt.

Overall, MRK ranks 6th on our list of best healthcare dividend stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at 10 times its earnings and grows its earnings at double digit rates annually, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.

A new rule proposed by the Trump administration could cancel health insurance access for people DACA recipients. 

If change were to take effect, it would undo a rule set by the Biden Administration last November to provide marketplace health care to people who qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Requirements for DACA include: a person must have arrived to the U.S. before they turned 16, have resided here continuously since and have been under 31 in 2012, when the program took effect, among others.

The proposed change to Biden's rule argues that DACA recipients do not meet the “lawfully present” standard set by Congress to be eligible for the Affordable Care Act.

“Having health coverage taken away means that there are limitations to how I can live and how I should live,” DACA recipient, Javier Diego Jacinto said.

Jacinto arrived in the U.S. at age 6. As a child, he was covered under Medi-Cal, but once he turned 18 years old, his health coverage was in limbo due to his DACA status.

It's a struggle that other DACA recipients like, Elizabeth Naputi, understand all too well.

Three years ago, she had a medical emergency, but because she was uninsured, she was forced to take out a loan to cover the expenses.



“Something that would just help us pay for everything because just healthcare, in general, is super expensive,” Naputi said.

Last November, the Biden administration allowed DACA recipients to buy health coverage through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, but President Trump's administration is now considering reversing the rule, which would make DACA recipients ineligible for health coverage like Covered California.

“Canceling it is going to have a severely negative impact on people who essentially came as children, right? They didn't have a say in coming to the United States. And so, by canceling their healthcare coverage, they are going to not have access to preventative care, which is one of the most incredibly important,” Immigration Attorney, Maria Chavez said.

According to Covered California, more than 40,000 people are eligible to qualify for the program as DACA recipients. Of those, less than 2,000 people are enrolled.

Since everyone is required to have health insurance in California, if the Trump administration's proposal to cancel insurance access becomes a reality, DACA recipients might face steep financial penalties.

“If you don't have health insurance in California, you'll pay a penalty, $900 per adult, $450 per child that's not insured,” Yadira Lopez with Cover California said.

Others want to know more about the existing rule and proposed changes.

“My only thought is who's being denied benefits that are citizens, you know, what's the opportunity cost in providing medical care to nationals of other countries,” a man who asked to remain anonymous said.

Since Naputi had to take out a loan for healthcare coverage, she's married and is now covered under her husband's private health insurance plan.

Though she's covered, she is still concerned about fellow DACA recipients.

“One of my closest friends has a baby and she struggles. She can't afford health insurance for herself, let alone for her baby. She tries to find different avenues,” Naputi said.

The rule is in its proposal stage and public comments remain open until April 11.

Wearable Devices (Nasdaq: WLDS) hat die Erweiterung seines Modells für Aktionspotentiale großer motorischer Einheiten (LMM) in die Märkte für prädiktive Gesundheitsüberwachung und kognitive Zustandsanalytik angekündigt. Diese KI-gestützte Bio-Signal-Plattform, die zuvor auf Gestensteuerung in XR fokussiert war, wird jetzt Muskelaktivitätssignale vom Handgelenk für Anwendungen zur Gesundheitsüberwachung analysieren.

Im Gegensatz zu herkömmlichen Bio-Sensoren lernt und passt sich das LMM kontinuierlich an und verwandelt Daten zur Muskelaktivität in umsetzbare Erkenntnisse. Die Technologie wird getestet für:Prädiktive Gesundheitsüberwachung zur Erkennung früher Anzeichen von GesundheitszuständenKognitive Zustandsanalytik zur Überwachung von Konzentration, Müdigkeit und StresslevelPrädiktive Analytik für das Nutzerverhalten

Das Unternehmen plant, das LMM Unternehmen, Forschern und Entwicklern zur Verfügung zu stellen, um Gesundheits- und Sportanwendungen zu entwickeln, physiologische Erkenntnisse in Unternehmenslösungen zu integrieren und prädiktive Gesundheitsmodelle zu verfeinern.

Wearable Devices' announcement represents a strategic expansion of their AI-powered bio-signal platform (LMM) beyond gesture controls into predictive health monitoring and cognitive state analytics. This move positions the company to potentially capture value in the growing digital health monitoring sector.

The technology's differentiation lies in its approach to continuous learning and adaptation of muscle activity signals, rather than passive data collection typical of most wearables. By analyzing micro-movements and muscle tone patterns, LMM could theoretically detect subtle physiological changes that precede visible symptoms.

However, several critical factors temper enthusiasm. The announcement lacks specifics on: clinical validation studies, regulatory pathway considerations, accuracy metrics, or established healthcare partnerships. The repeated qualifiers ("potential markets," "being evaluated," "intending to," "aims to") indicate this remains in early experimental stages rather than near-term commercialization.

The B2B platform strategy could accelerate adoption if successful, but healthcare integration requires substantial validation and typically moves at a deliberate pace. Without demonstrated clinical utility or regulatory clarity, this represents a directional shift with uncertain commercial timeline rather than an imminent market entry.

This announcement reflects Wearable Devices' attempt to expand their addressable market by applying their proprietary LMM technology to health monitoring applications. The strategic significance lies in their transition from purely interface-focused applications (XR control) to physiological analytics with potential recurring revenue models.

The technical approach leverages the same fundamental technology (muscle activity signal processing) but applies different analytical frameworks to extract health-relevant insights. This represents efficient R&D utilization but faces significant challenges in the health domain:

The B2B platform strategy (making LMM available to enterprises/developers) suggests Wearable is positioning itself as infrastructure rather than end-solution provider. This could accelerate use-case discovery but may dilute revenue capture compared to vertical integration approaches.

While conceptually promising, the announcement lacks concrete partnership announcements, implementation timelines, or revenue projections - indicating early exploration rather than imminent commercialization. The technology's competitive advantage versus established health wearables from Apple, Fitbit and medical device companies remains unproven.

NEW YORK CITY, March  24, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sesame, the company that offers Americans quality, convenient health care at half the typical price, today announced a technical integration with LillyDirect Self-Pay Pharmacy Solutions dispensing provider Gifthealth. The integration makes the fulfillment experience for single-dose vials of Eli Lilly and Company's Zepbound® (tirzepatide) obesity medication more convenient and transparent for clinically eligible Sesame patients without insurance coverage for GLP-1 medications.

Streamlined access to authentic, FDA-approved, rigorously-tested Zepbound comes from Sesame's direct integration with Gifthealth.  Zepbound is the first and only FDA-approved dual glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) obesity medication.

Clinically eligible Sesame patients who receive a prescription for Zepbound will pay either $349 (for 2.5mg single-vial doses) or $499 (for 5mg, 7.5mg and 10mg single-vial doses) through LillyDirect Self Pay Pharmacy Solutions, powered by  Gifthealth.  The integration is part of “Success by Sesame,” the most clinically comprehensive – and affordable – direct-to-consumer weight loss program in America.  

“Life-changing, branded medications such as Zepbound should be infinitely more accessible to the eligible patients that so desperately need them,” said David Goldhill, Sesame‘s co-founder and CEO, and a serial author on American healthcare reform.  “Sesame is the only company unleashing marketplace dynamics to make dozens of types of outpatient care, including specialties like weight management, so much more affordable and accessible.”

"At Gifthealth, we believe that accessing critical medications like authentic Zepbound should be simple, affordable, and transparent,” said Robert Hoppe, EVP of Life Sciences at Gifthealth. “This integration with Sesame is another step forward in eliminating barriers to care by providing a seamless, frictionless experience for patients paying out-of-pocket. Together, we're making it easier for people to get the treatment they need—at the best available price—without the hassle."

About Success by Sesame

Success by Sesame offers Americans the most comprehensive clinical weight loss program without compromising Sesame's low-price promise:  The price of the program for consumers who receive prescriptions for FDA-approved, branded medications like Zepbound is just $89 (but does not include the price of the medication). This monthly price includes face-to-face video visits and unlimited messaging with a licensed provider, lab panels that are professionally reviewed and evaluated, and close clinical supervision throughout the patient's journey. 

Unlike other programs, Success by Sesame patients always choose their own dedicated care provider, who will discuss and prescribe the best treatment options that take into account the patient's medical history, health goals, insurance status, and budget.  

Sesame:  Putting patients ahead of medications

In addition to its marketplace model and catering to cash payers, Sesame differs significantly from its competition by placing the emphasis on comprehensive patient care, provider choice, and successful outcomes – not profiting off of specific medications.  Sesame's marketplace features hundreds of board-certified providers for patients to choose from. Whether a patient's care path includes branded GLP-1 medication or requires no medication at all, patients receive the highest level of personalized clinical care.

The lowest price can help hundreds of millions

According to the National Center for Health Statistics, nearly three-quarters of American adults over the age of 20 are overweight or obese, a staggering 246 million Americans.  At least 25 million Americans are uninsured.

Studies have demonstrated tirzepatide (Zepbound's active ingredient) to be one of the most effective weight loss medications available; in a 72-week clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine, patients taking 5mg, 10mg, and 15mg doses of tirzepatide once weekly lost an average of 15%, 19.5%, and 20.9% of their body weight, respectively. 

How Sesame always offers the best price

Sesame has built a unique healthcare marketplace where thousands of healthcare providers covering all 50 states compete to serve American consumers seeking high-quality, convenient medical care at half the typical price.

Sesame's marketplace effect lowers the price of care, makes prices transparent, drives added convenience (the majority of appointments on Sesame take place within two hours), and ensures a superior consumer experience.

Sesame is a cash-pay marketplace that does not accept health insurance, removing additional cost and complexity from the consumer's care.

ABOUT SESAME

Sesame is the company that offers Americans quality, convenient health care at half the typical price. The company's marketplace eliminates insurance, allowing healthcare providers to compete on quality, accessibility – and pricing.  Sesame was ranked #1 by Healthline for overall care in 2021, 2022, 2023,  2024, and 2025, as well as Best for Doctor Choice in 2023, 2024, and 2025 by Forbes and most affordable telehealth in 2023 by CNET.

Less than two years ago, Nathan Davila was receiving services from Comprehensive Healthcare. Now, he provides those services to families in need of assistance.

As a team member of Comprehensive's Youth Mobile Outreach program, Davila uses his experiences to help local families work through their own issues.

“It feels really good to watch someone make progress,” Davila said. “For them to come in and they have no hope, nowhere to turn, and then we are graduating them and they're in an amazing spot, grades have improved, they're having better relationships, and their mindset has completely changed, that is enough impact for us to keep going.”

The outreach team is made up of five people, all with the same goal of helping families work through dysfunction and giving them the tools to do so. The program is meant to help youth who are in crisis, whether it is mental health issues, behavioral issues, substance use, or any other problem that is urgent but may not meet the criteria for higher level evaluations.

Comprehensive Healthcare's Youth Mobile Outreach team in Walla Walla helps families and youth work through issues, including mental health, substance use, behavioral problem and more. From left: Nathan Davila, Stephanie Beigel, Maddi Sprinkle, Lindsey Fuchs and Jared Ortiz.

The crisis-based program, which kicked off in summer 2024, typically lasts eight weeks, although it can be shorter or longer depending on each family's needs.

Most families are referred to Comprehensive Healthcare through the 988-crisis-hotline, local schools or primary care physicians. The team will then conduct an assessment with the referred family and decide whether the program is a good fit for them.

While the program looks different for each family, Davila said he mostly works with parents and guardians on building communication skills, trust, self-care and family roles and expectations.

" And some of the parents don't have anyone to talk to, so it's just being that person to listen,” Davila said. “They just need somebody to talk to and I can be that person."

While Davila mostly works with the parents or adults in the families, Maddi Sprinkle, the program's peer counselor, works exclusively with the children. She works in local schools and sees three to four students a day.

Sprinkle said she mostly helps students with anger management and coping skills, which will help with the trauma that many of them have experienced. She uses her own past experiences to let them know someone else has been where they are and understands what they're going through.

“I can help them in ways that maybe a clinical person cannot,” Sprinkle said. “So we just chat and go through what they're feeling that day, what they want to talk about and then we'll get some work done, like I'll bring coping skills worksheets or anger management worksheets.”

Like Davila, a big part of what Sprinkle does is being there to listen and help however she can, without pushing clients to do things or talk about things before they're ready.

She said she has one student who didn't want to talk for about two weeks, so they just played games together and she let him know he could talk whenever he wanted, but he didn't have to.

“It's actually seemed to be helping,” Sprinkle said. “We actually got a call from mom saying he's been a lot more open around home, more open to helping around the house, checking on her, and he's been opening up a lot more at meetings.”

Because the program is crisis-based and only about eight weeks, it is considered a "bridge program" that will help families through a period of acute distress before possibly moving on to a long-term service.

For Davila, it is sometimes difficult to bring families into the process and get them to engage. Often parents feel like the issue exists only within the youth and do not see that the whole family needs support, he said.

Care Coordinator Jared Ortiz acts as the main point of contact for the program, and he said working in the program had transformed team members into more patient people.

“I'm trying to give them (the clients) a little cushion into our services, not trying to force it on them and just kind of giving them their time to incorporate themselves into our program,” Ortiz said.

For many clients, the program is paid for through Medicaid or whatever insurance they have. If it is not, Comprehensive Healthcare has ways to eliminate the cost for families.

“That's something that families worry about — their stressors and barriers for financials,” said program director Lindsey Fuchs. “We don't want to make that a barrier for them to get care, so we take anybody and everybody.”

Fuchs said since the program started, it has become apparent just how limited the mental health resources for youth are in the area.

Three of the team members are now sitting on a coalition to advocate for youth and are trying to bring in more referrals and let people know the program exists.

"We knew that things were lacking out there, but once we got out there and were networking … we want to be part of the solution,” Fuchs said.

Washington, D.C. Newsroom, Mar 24, 2025 /
            08:00 am

Three U.S. representatives have introduced a bill that supports American taxpayers who choose to participate in health sharing, a care option favored by Christians and pro-lifers for its religious freedom protections.

If passed, the Health Care Sharing Ministry Tax Parity Act would designate health sharing payments as tax deductable, alleviating costs for families who opt for health sharing over traditional health coverage, many of whom do so for religious reasons. The act was introduced by U.S. Reps. Mike Kelly, R-Pennsylvania; Greg Murphy, R-North Carolina; and Chris Smith, R-New Jersey.

“Unfairly, Americans have been historically penalized by the tax code when they chose to use faith-based health care sharing ministries to meet their health care needs. The Health Care Sharing Ministry Tax Parity Act will remedy this problem, ensuring Americans are no longer disadvantaged by the tax code for their religious beliefs,” Smith said in a press release on March 14.

Health sharing became a popular alternative to mainstream insurance coverage over a decade ago with the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, which included a mandate from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services requiring insurance plans to fund contraception, sterilizations, and early abortion pills.

The practice allows members to pool their money and pay for each other's health care costs, similar to traditional insurance plans.

Legal disputes over religious freedom violations that precipitated from the Affordable Care Act continue today, with the Supreme Court set to hear a case in June regarding a part of the law governing preventative care.

“Americans should have choices when it comes to their health care. For many families, traditional insurance is a great option. For some, however, particularly people of faith, alternative options such as health care sharing ministries more closely align with their values,” Kelly said in the release.

“This legislation preserves that choice for families by allowing them to deduct payments made as part of their ministry membership in their taxes by classifying regular ministry expenses as medical care expenses,” he added. “It's time we focus on initiatives that reintroduce freedom and dignity back to our health care system.”

Solidarity HealthShare collaborated with the three congressmen on the legislation. Founded in 2012 in wake of the Affordable Care Act, Solidarity HealthShare facilitates health sharing among individuals and families across the country who are looking to opt out of traditional insurance for a more faith-centered option.

“Solidarity is grateful for the leadership and support of Congressman Mike Kelly and his team, who have consistently taken the lead in working for tax parity for health care sharing ministry members,” Solidarity HealthShare President Chris Faddis and CEO Brad Hahn told CNA in a statement.

“His introduction of the Health Care Sharing Ministry Tax Parity Act has the potential to be a game changer for families who have chosen to escape the troubled landscape of traditional health insurance but have been unable to benefit from tax deductions available to other Americans,” the executives added.

“This bill is the culmination of an industry-wide effort to provide tax relief to members of health care sharing ministries,” they said, adding: “We are also thankful for the support of the Alliance of Health Care Sharing and other health care sharing ministry partners for advancing this effort.”

Health sharing ministries can now seek accreditation from an independent Healthcare Sharing Accreditation Board, an option that will benefit both the organizations that promote themselves as an alternative to health insurance and their membership, a leading health sharing trade group has said.

, Contributor. 

Amidst the once-in-a-generation buzz around artificial intelligence, a new subject area has slowly but definitively gained steam in the last few years: quantum computing.

The concept has become especially popular over the last year, as the world's largest technology companies have started releasing some of their progress and work in this arena. Moreover, research has also emerged in recent months about how it can effectively solve some of the world's toughest data driven problems-- meaning that it has the potential to significantly transform healthcare and life-sciences in a positive manner.

But what exactly is quantum computing?

Well, its not just one thing; rather, the field encompasses a wide range of other important disciplines and studies, including quantum physics, mechanics, hardware and algorithms. Essentially, the entire study relies heavily on the foundational principles of quantum physics and the mechanics of subatomic particles to ultimately reveal and harness the realities of nature for productive compute.

There are four key principles of quantum physics which drive the breakthroughs in computing ability:

Applied to compute power and the ability to solve problems, quantum computing leverages these principles to perform tasks at a higher realm of efficiency and possibility. Classical compute uses bits (0 or 1 binary code) to read, store and process information; quantum computing instead uses “qubits” which can process similar information-- however, within the realms of the 4 principles mentioned above. For example, qubits can harness superposition, meaning that they can represent either 0 or 1 simultaneously and can therefore query more possibilities at a given time; this ability to process significantly more information simultaneously, along with the capabilities unlocked by the other principles, is what ultimately makes quantum computing so much more powerful than classical computing.

Why is all of this important? Because this technology, though still in its infancy, enables potential breakthroughs across all domains of science and healthcare.

In the realm of AI, there are significant applications. For one, machine learning, which refers to the process and ability to analyze and generate insights from vast quantities of data, stands to gain tremendously with breakthroughs from quantum computing, given how it can enable previously impossible computational tasks.

For healthcare and life sciences, quantum computing can unlock new insights based on data that was previously too vast to be analyzed. Amazon Web Services describes how quantum chemistry has empowered new chemistry simulations and data configurations which can unlock entirely novel leaps into the worlds of drug discovery, material sciences and nanotechnology.

Other great applications exist in the clinical space as well. A paper published in the Journal of Informatics in Health and Biomedicine describes how this technology “can search large, unstructured datasets more efficiently than their classical counterparts, enabling more effective optimization of complex problems in healthcare and biomedical research.” Undoubtedly, unstructured data is a multi-hundred billion dollar problem in healthcare; with the transition of hospitals and healthcare data to EMRs and digital systems over the last two decades, few solutions exist to collate all of this information and provide meaningful insights. Though software stacks are emerging that can help process this information, the datasets will only continue to grow, and quantum computing can play a significant role in alleviating this issue.

With regard to other fields ranging from drug discovery and design to genomic sequencing, protein folding and other key biomedical research applications, quantum computing will unlock new ways to solve some of the most fundamental questions of life at a molecular and individual particulate level.

This is why large technology companies are in such a rush to pursue (perhaps silently) their work in this field. Just a few months ago, Google announced the launch of Willow, the company's quantum chip that is capable of immense computational capabilities: “Willow performed a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes that would take one of today's fastest supercomputers 10 septillion (that is, 1025) years — a number that vastly exceeds the age of the Universe.” Last month, Microsoft similarly announced its Majorana 1 chip, providing “a clear path to fit a million qubits on a single chip that can fit in the palm of one's hand.”

Interestingly, these innovations also require significant work in developing entirely new hardware stacks and physical materials. That's why hardware giants such as Nvidia, who are already leading in this space, have a huge leg up in developing quantum processing units (QPUs) and the future means to enable this work further.

Nevertheless, it must be noted that this field is not brand new, by any means; although news coverage and media buzz around this subject is just now gaining steam, these breakthroughs are actually the culmination of decades of science and research finally converging at a serendipitous moment in time.

Healthcare B2B e-commerce platform Kyberlife has bagged $3 million in an investing round led by 5I Ventures. The sum was also raised from East Ventures, A2D Ventures, and NUS Alumni Ventures.

WHAT IT DOES

Founded in Singapore in 2021, the startup runs an online marketplace for sourcing critical healthcare equipment for use by academics, research laboratories, and other healthcare institutions. It claims to have streamlined the oft-lengthy and complex procurement process, reducing time by 40% on average. 

Connecting suppliers with laboratories, healthcare institutions, and research centres, the platform now features around 1.2 million products from 160 brands, including Merck, Eppendorf, and Sartorius, serving major customers such as the National University Singapore, Duke-NUS, Nanyang Technological University, and National Cancer Centre of Singapore. 

WHAT IT'S FOR

Kyberlife will utilise its fresh funds to onboard more suppliers onto its marketplace across Southeast Asia, particularly Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand. "The company aims to grow its vendor portfolio to ten times its current size within the next three years," the startup shared in a statement. It will also introduce new product categories such as laboratory instruments and chemical reagents, supporting clinical trials and pharmaceutical research in the region. 

The funds will also be invested in AI and data analytics so it can enable personalised product recommendations. 

MARKET SNAPSHOT

Beyond Southeast Asia, digital healthcare marketplace operators Flipkart+ Health and PharmEasy also sought to address challenges in the procurement of critical healthcare supplies across the region, particularly long sourcing processes, lead times and opaque pricing. 

In 2021, Indian online pharmacy PharmEasy bought Aknamed, adding healthcare supply chain management to its portfolio. The following year, Flipkart Group, also from India, entered the healthcare supply chain segment with Flipkart Health+ after taking a minor stake in e-pharmacy startup SastaSundar.

On a sunny weekday in Atlanta, a small crowd of people gathered for a rally outside of a labor union headquarters building.

The event, put together by Atlanta-area Democratic U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams, was attended mostly by union members and recently fired federal workers, including Ryan Sloane.

"I was fired by an anonymous email at 9 p.m. in the middle of a holiday weekend," he said.

Sloane is still seeking reinstatement, but he feels he no longer has much to lose by speaking out.

"I'm only here today because they cannot fire me twice," Sloane said.

When he received his termination notice, he was a few months into a job as a public affairs specialist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

At the CDC, his days were spent updating far-flung local TV, radio, and newspaper journalists about threats such as seasonal flu, measles, and food safety in their communities.

A judge has ordered the reinstatement of some fired federal employees, at least temporarily. But their jobs are still on the line.

Sloane said his former colleagues at the CDC whose jobs aren't yet in limbo are scared.

"They are terrified that their life's work is going to be deleted from servers and not backed up because it does not comport with the ideologies of the new administration," he said. "No one is benefiting from this."

From the end of January to mid-February, the Trump administration took offline some CDC webpages and froze external communications, including its widely read Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report epidemiological digest.

The webpages that were removed included CDC public health reports, datasets, and guidance on infectious diseases and sexual health. After a court order, some agency information was restored, at least for now.

But even temporary disruptions to CDC communications could have big ripple effects.

It is information that state and local health departments, hospitals, university researchers, and others rely on to help them respond to outbreaks.

"CDC is there to provide technical information, provide funding, provide support, but it's a collaborative work, working together to keep Americans safe," said former CDC Director Tom Frieden, who headed the agency from 2009 to 2017. He is now president and CEO of the nonprofit organization Resolve to Save Lives. "In this country, we have a patchwork or network of public health. It's really up to the local, city, and state health departments to get the job done."

City and state health agencies also need the collaboration of CDC experts to help investigate local disease outbreaks and other threats to public health.

A clinician who has worked at the agency for more than two decades pointed to the CDC's singular ability to send medical supplies and deploy highly specialized teams of scientists to help local communities identify and contain outbreaks. KFF Health News agreed not to use the clinician's name because she fears she will be fired for airing these views publicly.

"A lot of them are assigned to state and local health departments, so really even beyond individual positions, any funding cuts that the agency takes are also passed on to state and local health departments," the clinician said. "A lot of their budget comes from federal money as well."

The Trump administration has attempted to terminate hundreds of employees from the CDC alone, along with hundreds more workers at the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies with a U.S. health and safety role.

Many public health and science researchers are concerned about the cuts' impacts on the nation's ability to respond to threats — and about whether state and local public health departments will be able to keep communities healthy without the CDC's partnership.

Billionaire Elon Musk has said his Department of Government Efficiency intends to keep cutting federal agencies' budgets and staff, targeting what it calls "fraud."

"Anytime someone gets fired, it's always difficult. But with $36 trillion in debt, we have to reduce the size of the federal government," Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene told WABE during a March visit to the Georgia State Capitol.

Her district includes parts of suburban Atlanta about 30 miles from CDC headquarters.

Greene also chairs a House subcommittee also called "DOGE," for "Delivering on Government Efficiency."

"Fortunately, with all the investments that are being brought back into the country under President Trump, I really hope that those federal workers are able to find new jobs," she said.

She did not comment on whether local public health departments around the country would be able to work efficiently without the support of CDC experts who have been terminated.

But many U.S. public health experts are expressing concern.

The CDC has long been a key training ground for the next generation of U.S. public health researchers.

Emory University epidemiology professor Patrick Sullivan was one of them earlier in his career. The HIV expert previously worked at the CDC for about 15 years.

"When I started working in HIV prevention at CDC in the early 1990s, we didn't have the treatments that essentially allowed people living with HIV to have a full, healthy, normal lifespan," he said. "We didn't have the treatments that essentially allowed people living with HIV to have a test that people could take home to test themselves."

Sullivan said the progress he has seen over the last several decades gave him optimism, and that advances in HIV treatment and prevention are a great example of the importance of federal support for public health work.

"Discovery science and pharmacy science really have given us the tools that we need to end the HIV epidemic in the United States," he said.

But, to have those scientific tools without adequate public health staff or funding to use them, he said, will cost American lives.

One day Melissa Dietrich, a self-described farm girl from outside Fort Wayne, was like any other number of Americans spending hours on the phone to negotiate down a surprisingly high medical bill.

The next, she was whisked into the Indiana Statehouse to meet Gov. Mike Braun and his wife Maureen, whom Dietrich would sit next to at the State of the State address.

There, she served as a physical embodiment of one of Braun's foremost issues and one of the largest battles within the legislature: tackling the rising and opaque cost of health care.

The fight over health care costs at the Statehouse has been muddied by power, money and finger-pointing, as influential groups have pushed their own narratives about who to blame for high costs. The lobbying giants haven't even agreed on the basic question of whether Indiana actually has an outlier health care cost problem to begin with, though reputable studies insist the state does.

Industry leaders among hospitals, insurance and drug manufacturers spend several hundreds of thousands a year on lobbying and political contributions, landing frequently among the state's top spenders.

But Braun has effectively planted his flag in the debate, not only by expressing openly his skepticism of the hospital and insurance lobby, but by appointing Gloria Sachdev as his secretary of health ― the former director of the Employers' Forum of Indiana, which commissioned a series of studies directing the blame onto hospital fees.

Though the legislature has broadened its focus in recent years beyond just hospitals, looking at pharmacy benefit managers, physician noncompetes and price transparency, legislation targeting hospital bills have proven some of the toughest to negotiate.

Braun has already written roughly a dozen health-related executive orders attempting to enact more price and financial transparency, including one requiring a study of how much nonprofit hospitals pay to the community in the form of charity care, compared to the value of their tax exemptions. Meanwhile, lawmakers are debating a bill proposing price controls on the largest nonprofit hospitals, but it's already been scaled back.

"I don't think the last administration had any interest wrestling with the biggest industry in our state," Braun told IndyStar. "Now that we're getting some real conversation going, they're coming in and doing what they shouldn't be doing. They're trying to water down these reforms. They ought to be helping us more in terms of what they can do to reform themselves, not to perpetuate a broken status quo."

In the same speech where Braun said the issue has been in the past "too tough to tackle because of entrenched special interests," he gave a shoutout to Dietrich.

Dietrich's story is relatively simple, but emblematic: She's 49 years old, no major health issues to speak of, works nights for a national retailer and helps on the family farm. Just after moving to her current job in 2022, she went in for an annual wellness visit and bloodwork. She gave the provider her new insurance card.

Yet, she got a bill around $1,300, for what should have only cost her a copay of $35 with her new insurance. It was only after hours on the phone with her employer, her insurer and the hospital that she got the bill down to about $300.

"Everybody that I've talked to consistently rolls their head, rolls their eyes, not at me, but just at the situation, because everybody can relate to this," she said. "Some people unfortunately just suck it up because they don't have the time or the energy to fight back."

There's been no shortage of drama amid the rhetoric war, and there are powerful players on all sides.

When Sachdev, a pharmacist by trade, started leading the Employers' Forum in 2015, she unanimously heard from members that their highest pain point was the affordability of health care. She cold-called a Rand Corp. researcher to commission a study of the prices being paid by self-insured employers at Indiana hospitals, compared to what Medicare reimburses those hospitals for the same services.

In 2019, a second iteration came out looking at 25 states and gathering data from more than just self-insured employers. That study put Indiana's hospital prices at the top of the chart.

That caught the attention of Al Hubbard, founder of E&A Industries, former chair of Indiana Republican Party and an influential voice in Indiana policy circles. He formed a nonprofit Hoosiers for Affordable Healthcare and asked Sachdev to serve on the board.

A third Rand study released in September 2020 found Indiana's hospital prices were sixth highest out of 49 states. The following year, Indiana's legislative leaders cited this and a Harvard University study showing similar rankings in a letter to hospital and insurance executives urging them to find their own solutions or else legislators will force solutions upon them.

IU Health was the only large nonprofit hospital system to announce a price freeze to bring their prices in line with national averages. Otherwise, industry leaders' responses to that letter from lawmakers offered no specific plans.

So the 2023 legislative session saw some of the first attempts at tackling the hospital-price issue head-on. A House priority bill sought to penalize hospitals that don't keep their prices charged to commercial patients in line with a certain threshold ― a percentage of Medicare, modeled after the Rand studies. The Indiana Hospital Association pushes back against Rand's methodology with force, referencing studies of their own that argue Indiana is not actually an outlier and suggesting the real drivers of higher bills are prescription drug costs, health plan administrative costs and pricy physicians.

By session's end, that became a data-collection bill, punting real action to the 2025 legislative session.

Hence, 2024's six-way Republican primary for governor held significance for industry leaders. Two months before the election, IU Health CEO Dennis Murphy sent an email to about 25 of his hospital C-suite peers, imploring them to donate to the campaign of Brad Chambers, who he deemed most sensitive to the industry's concerns. And he specifically cautioned against Braun, whose ideas he said would "very harmful to our industry."

Hubbard, meanwhile, of Hoosiers for Affordable Healthcare, had given $10,000 to both Braun and Chambers by this point. He would go on to give Braun an extra $20,000.

Braun hasn't forgotten about what happened during his primary.

"They didn't like my running for governor because I've been talking about this," he said.

Relations seem to be smoother this year. The Indiana Hospital Association has new staff, including a new CEO, Scott Tittle, who says they've had "great conversations" with the administration and legislative leaders.

Murphy, too, the IU Health CEO, said he's had "productive discussions" with the administration.

"I'm not sure that I disagree with Gov. Braun that the price of health care needs to be managed and needs to come down," Murphy told IndyStar. "And I think we are working with the administration to figure out how to do that."

The predominant rhetoric over the years at the Indiana Statehouse, and corresponding price-controlling legislation, has placed the spotlight on the state's largest nonprofit hospitals ― systems taking in billions a year in revenue, such as IU Health, Ascension St. Vincent and Community Health Network.

Researchers broadly support the conclusion that hospital prices are what make the United States an outlier compared to other wealthy nations. The U.S. spent twice as much per capita on health as comparable countries in 2021, a Peterson Center on Healthcare and Kaiser Family Foundation study found, and inpatient and outpatient care is the largest category of health spending responsible for that variation.

Why? Because large, consolidated hospital systems can charge higher prices, argue economists like Loren Adler, associate director at the Center on Health Policy at the Brookings Institute.

"There often isn't any meaningful competition," he said. "These are generally profit maximizing entities trying to make money. ... At the end of the day, it's hospital prices, the per unit prices, are the thing that is the most out of whack with the rest of the world."

A study from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2022 found most of Indiana's metropolitan areas are considered "highly concentrated," meaning just one or two systems own all the hospitals in a given market. This study's analysis of 27 hospital mergers between 2005 and 2015 found an increase in prices by more than 10% post-merger.

Hospital leaders point to the complexity of health care pricing. Government payers ― those using Medicare or Medicaid ― make up two-thirds of patients at Indiana hospitals, according to data from the Indiana Hospital Association. By their calculation, the government reimburses for these patients at a rate that's below the cost of providing the care, and the state's Medicaid rate hasn't risen in decades. So hospitals cost-shift to commercial payers, a smaller segment of their revenue base, to make up for that.

Consolidation, too, is what has saved some rural hospitals from going away, Tittle argued.

"I'd suggest that consolidation... shouldn't be seen as a bad thing, but also making sure that Hoosiers have access to the care they need," he said.

They also point out, Hoosiers are unhealthy. Indiana routinely ranks in the bottom 10 states in terms of its health outcomes, such as rates of cancer, diabetes and infant mortality.

Patient advocates point to the hospitals' own audited financial statements, which show operating profit margins ranging ranging anywhere from -5% in recent lean years to 10% other years, depending on the system. They point to the millions hospital executives make in salaries, to the billions nonprofits hold in cash and investments. They point to the marble floors and art fixtures and water fountains adorning some of the largest hospitals' lobbies.

"They're just poor mouthing, but they're not hurting," Marni Jameson Carey, president of the advocacy group Power to the Patients, said of hospitals. "They should profit, but not excessively."

The hospitals argue margins around 5% and bountiful cash reserves are right on target for making sure they can continue operations indefinitely and weather any storms, from global pandemics to cyber attacks.

"We can't be the corner restaurant that didn't make it during COVID," Murphy said. "We have been here for 100 years, and we need to be here for another 100. We can't go away."

In various public statements, hospitals also generally point a finger at the power insurance companies wield over premiums.

Some advocates believe big hospitals and big insurers are equally complicit in a concentrated system where consumer-facing prices are hard to find. Braun is among this camp, as is Matt Bell, a lobbyist for Hoosiers for Affordable Healthcare. Like with hospitals, there are only a small handful of large insurance companies controlling the Indiana market.

"So where is the impetus for those two to ever enter into a negotiation on behalf of me as an employer?" Bell said. "They're co dependent, and that's what we've created with the big systems, in my opinion. They get mad when I call it a cabal, but it's a cabal."

But insurers argue they aren't actually on equal footing with the hospitals. Some hospital systems institute "all or nothing" clauses, which say that in order for them to accept a certain insurance network, that network has to take on all the hospitals within that system. Meanwhile, insurers are federally required to have enough doctors in network within a certain distance of all its members. In other words, a given insurer might need a certain hospital more than the hospital needs the insurer. (House Bill 1003 this session would ban all-or-nothing clauses.)

"Negotiations with the systems are barely negotiations," said Marty Wood, president of the Insurance Institute of Indiana. "The hospitals have the upper hand across the board."

On the other hand, advocates argue insurance companies don't have incentive to push back. The Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to spend 80% of their revenue from premiums on health care and the remaining 20% on administrative costs and profits. But 20% of a bigger number is just a bigger number.

"So the insurance companies pretend that they're negotiating to the lowest possible price," Carey, of Power to the Patients, said. "If the hospitals charge more, and they just shrug and say, 'Oh, the prices are going up. Too bad.'"

After her ordeal, Dietrich decided she'd rather drive out of state for care.

That's because she found a direct primary care provider, a model in which she pays an upfront monthly membership fee to access primary care services without insurance.

So when she needs the occasional checkup or quick fix ― like the piece of wood lodged in her thumb a month ago from working on the farm ― she now drives to a strip-mall DPC office two and a half hours away, in Detroit.

"The only way that I can see to pare it down, is to cut the fluff, get rid of the nonsense," she said. "We're tired of the nonsense."

According to a recent study by Jackson National Life Insurance Company, there is a notable gap between individuals' perceptions of health care and long-term care retirement costs and their overall financial preparedness, underscoring the need for better retirement planning.

“Retirement should be a time for security and stability; however, our research shows many households may be unprepared for the realities of the healthcare challenges and expenses they will face,” said Glen Franklin, assistant vice president of Research, RIA and Lead Generation Strategy for Jackson National Life Distributors LLC, the marketing and business distribution of Jackson.

“These new survey data should be a wakeup call for policymakers, financial professionals and older Americans themselves,” said Andrew Eschtruth, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. “We are particularly concerned that too many people nearing or in retirement don't have a good grasp of their potential healthcare needs and out-of-pocket costs, which could narrow their options when it comes time to pay the bills.”

Key findings from the research include:

“Our research is particularly timely given potential policy shifts resulting from the election outcome, as proposals addressing healthcare reform and federal funding for long-term care programs could significantly impact retirees' healthcare costs and savings strategies. This further underscores the importance of working with financial professionals to prepare for an evolving landscape and proactively address healthcare risks in investors' retirement plans."

When respondents were asked for their best estimate of how much money they and—if applicable—their spouse/partner will spend per year after they retire for out-of-pocket healthcare costs, including doctors, hospitals, prescription drugs, vision care, and dentistry, 35% of them estimated less than the median amount of $4,000/year, while 23% could not make an estimation, said Franklin. Meanwhile, he added, 80% of respondents think that someone in poor health would spend more than $5,000 per year on out-of-pocket healthcare costs alone, while respondents in poor health actually report an average of $4,700 per year for total healthcare expenses.

And when respondents were asked for their best estimate of how much money they and—if applicable—their spouse/partner will spend per year after they retire on all health insurance costs, 57% estimated less than the likely range of $10,000-15,000 per year, while 34% could not make an estimation. Then when they were asked how much they think it would cost annually to get around-the-clock, long-term care in their home, 38% estimated less than the likely range of $75,000 or more. For the annual cost of the average nursing home in their area, 58% estimated less than the likely range of $100,000 or more.

Underestimating costs can negatively affect a consumer's financial and retirement planning. As Franklin pointed out, “underestimating what is likely to be the largest expense in retirement can result in failure to identify sufficient sources of guaranteed income to cover necessities, or depletion of financial assets with many years left to live—both of which could cause a dramatic decline in lifestyle or—in the worst case—financial insolvency and the inability to maintain independence.”

So, what are some of the steps that advisors can take to teach their clients about these costs and help them take a proactive approach to their financial planning? Sharing the basic facts is a great start, said Franklin. In surveying financial professionals, he said that 53% reported that they do not discuss Medicare, Medicare Advantage or supplemental health insurance with any of their clients. Moreover, 59% reported that they do not discuss the financial risk of needing long-term care with any of their clients. “Their clients cannot properly prepare for retirement if they do not have a full picture of the major costs involved with retirement,” he pointed out.

The research, conducted between July 12 and August 2, 2024, included online surveys of more than 400 financial professionals and 500 investors with at least $100,000 in financial assets and between the ages of 48 and 78. Respondents were required to participate in or lead household financial decision-making.

The study is the third installment of Jackson's Security in Retirement Series, conducted in partnership with the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, and follows the initial longevity risk and inflation risk studies, which were released over the past 15 months. Jackson said that this multi-phased research initiative aims to provide useful, actionable and research-based insights on many potential threats to financial security in retirement.

Opinion articles provide independent perspectives on key community issues, separate from our newsroom reporting.

Right now, politicians in Washington are debating the future of Medicaid. They throw around big numbers and rhetoric around “waste,” “fraud,” and “abuse.” For too many politicians in Washington, Medicaid is just another political football to be tossed around as red meat rhetoric to throw to their bases in hopes of securing their next campaign donation.

But Medicaid is not a political football to us, nor is it some abstract political debate. To us it is literally a lifesaver. 

As the parents of two children adopted out of the foster care system who suffer from complex medical issues, Medicaid is the difference between providing for our family or not. 

And it is not just us. For millions of other families just like ours, Medicaid isn't just a safety net — it's a critical part of our survival and well-being, providing access to essential services and care that we would otherwise be unable to afford. The importance of Medicaid cannot be overstated, particularly for families dealing with chronic conditions, disabilities and other long-term medical challenges.

In our family, our 5-year-old daughter has had six hospitalizations and four ambulance rides to deal with her complex health issues. Our son, who is 7 years old, navigates Autism and ADHD. Medicaid has paid for all their treatments, and if it weren't for Medicaid, we would easily be bankrupt, twice over. 

What often gets lost in the political debate is that Medicaid is the backbone of American health care, covering more than 72 million people across race, income, and geography. It funds health care for nearly half of all births, two-thirds of nursing home residents and millions of people with disabilities. 

Medicaid offers comprehensive coverage, including doctor visits, hospital stays, prescription medications, and specialty services. These services are not optional for families with complex medical needs like ours. They are vital to maintaining the health and quality of life for our children. In fact, for our family, and millions like us, Medicaid provides the only means of accessing necessary therapies, medical devices and specialized medical care. 

And now, Republicans and President Donald Trump in Washington are contemplating cutting the program so they can pay for tax cuts of billionaires. That would be a devastating outcome for our family.

We are a veteran and a school teacher. We have served our nation and our community. And our kids deserve better than politicians who will sell out our healthcare so billionaires, who already get extensive tax cuts, can get even richer. 

Medicaid is not a political football. It is not a bargaining chip to be sold away. It is even more than just an insurance program — it is a lifeline for families with complex medical needs. It ensures our loved ones can access the care they need to thrive without the crushing weight of financial strain. In one of the wealthiest nations on earth, no family should have to choose between lifesaving medical care for their children and being able to put food on their table.

Medicaid works. We should be working to strengthen and expand it, not gut it. Our kids, and millions of others across the country, deserve high-quality health care.

Gridlocked traffic is the last place Jorge De Apodaca wants to be after his cancer treatment appointment. Dizziness and “foggy brain” don't go well with bumper-to-bumper traffic.

The 68-year-old's commute is now a bit easier since the University of Miami Health System expanded to Doral, one of the fastest growing cities in the state. While De Apodaca and his wife still have to slog through traffic, the drive from their Miami Lakes home to Doral is shorter than to UHealth's Kendall location, where he had undergone treatment

Every time he walks into UHealth's new medical center at Downtown Doral, the staff offers him snacks and coffee, the UM graduate said. During a recent visit, he was given a free lymphatic massage to help his swollen feet. And he has a nice view of the city while he's getting treatment from an upper floor. 

“It's a healing environment,” he said. “It heals the soul, takes out the stress, which obviously helps the cancer.”

UM's health system, which shares a main campus with Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami's Health District, is the newest health giant to expand its footprint into Doral, offering primary care as well as cardiology, oncology, urology, cancer treatment and outpatient surgeries. Patients can usually go home the same day of a procedure at the new center, 8375 NW 53rd Ter.

“No one and their families like to be in a hospital,” said Dr. Dipen Parekh, UHealth's chief operating officer. “And because of the advances in medicine ... we are able to deliver some of the most complex care without the patients having to spend the night in the hospital.” 

The U's expansion into Doral advances the city's position as South Florida's newest medical hub. Growing Doral is home to more than 80,000 residents and over 17,000 businesses, and close to highways and the airport. 

The move west is part of UHealth's plan to bring care closer to patients, a strategy to not only improve access to care, but to also attract and retain patients and employees. 

“It's location, location, location,” said Manuel Pila, the economic developer for the city of Doral, echoing the familiar real estate refrain about a home for sale in a desirable neighborhood. “The opportunity was here, the space was here, and the growing population was here.”

Doral, a city once filled with sprawling fields of cows and warehouses, is now full of houses, apartments, condos, restaurants, shops, hotels, schools and parks. And it's projected to keep growing, with the city's population expected to balloon to over 100,000 by 2030. 

Baptist Health South Florida, the region's largest health system, ventured into Doral in 1990 after seeing an opportunity to provide care to a “medically underserved” and growing population, said Ana Lopez-Blazquez, executive vice president and chief strategy officer at Baptist Health.

“Early on, Doral had the recipe for success,” she said, noting that Baptist's presence in the city has “grown over the years based on the needs of that community.”

In February, Baptist opened a standalone cancer center offering chemotherapy, infusion and radiation. Baptist also has a hospital, ER, and a primary and urgent care center in the city. 

“Expanding our cancer care services to Doral represents an important step in providing high-quality treatment options and resources for more patients closer to home,” Dr. Michael Zinner, CEO and executive medical director of Miami Cancer Institute and Baptist Health Cancer Care, said in a statement earlier this year announcing the opening. “For us, it's not just about growth, but empowering the community to better prioritize their health.”

Doral's rapid growth has everyone's attention — families, real estate developers, businesses and the health industry.

Miami-Dade's public safety net hospital system, Jackson Health, opened the 98-bed Jackson West hospital four years ago. Nicklaus Children's Health System, with outpatient and urgent care centers across the region, has cared for thousands of patients since its Doral outpatient and urgent center opened in 2008. The center, which also offers dental and rehab, saw more than 50,000 patients in 2024.

While Doral has seen an explosion of healthcare growth, medical centers, outpatient, urgent care and standalone emergency rooms are also popping up across South Florida as hospitals compete for patients.

UHealth will open a new seven-story medical center in North Miami-Dade later this year, part of a mega-development of residential towers, to serve Aventura, North Miami and surrounding areas. Miami's Mercy Hospital now has a standlone ER in Kendall. And Miami Beach's Mount Sinai Medical Center plans to open a standalone emergency room in Westchester.

“Every major system is expanding. The whole area is hot now,” although some locations are hotter then others, including Doral, Aventura, North Miami, and parts of Palm Beach County, said Johnathan Peavy. He's the operations manager for the Fort Lauderdale office of Robins & Morton, a company that specializes in healthcare-related construction. 

The Alabama firm, which oversaw the construction of UHealth Doral, is working on several South Florida projects, including UHealth at SoLé Mia in North Miami-Dade, and Baptist Health's new rehabilitation hospital in South Miami.

Everyone seems to want a piece of the South Florida market, including President Donald Trump, whose company plans to build luxury condos at the edge of Trump's golf course resort in Doral.

Health systems are also trying to keep up with South Florida's growth and are searching for “pockets” in the community where clusters of people live or are moving to that don't have nearby health services, according to Peavy. But hospitals are also facing a challenging real estate market, where “prices are through the roof” and limited land to build.

He expects South Florida's healthcare market will continue to heat up, from Homestead in South Miami-Dade to Martin County on Florida's Treasure Coast.

For patients, the expansion of health services into neighborhoods mean it's a lot easier to find care close to home. For health systems, the push into the suburbs isn't just to improve access to care, one of several factors that can affect a person's health. It's also a chance to secure lifelong patients, reduce overcrowding at main locations, and prepare for the future.

Hospitals aren't just competing for patients, but also for nurses and doctors during a nationwide shortage predicted to get worse by 2030, when the youngest Baby Boomers — people born between 1946 and 1964 — hit 65. Health experts worry there won't be enough healthcare providers to meet the needs of an aging population. 

Executives bet a shorter work commute — a benefit that comes from opening medical centers across neighborhoods — could help improve retention and hiring. 

And while many people have moved out of South Florida due to rising costs, some parts of the region are seeing the arrival of younger families. Miami Beach, once a popular retirement destination for seniors, now has a younger, and fitness-friendly crowd of residents. Doral has more families moving in. Sweetwater is trying to reinvent itself into a college town. 

For some health giants, the strategy to attract young and old patients has even lured some across county borders.

Memorial Regional, one of two public hospital systems in Broward, opened a primary care center a few years ago in Northwest Miami-Dade, near Hialeah and Miami Lakes. Memorial opened the center after seeing a big need for preventive and specialty care in an area that is home to more than 500,000 people.

Nicklaus Children's, whose hospital near South Miami is considered to be one of the state's top pediatric hospitals, recently struck deals to become the primary pediatric provider of public hospital system Broward Health and the exclusive pediatric teaching hospital of Florida International University's medical college.

Patients can find Baptist Health South Florida, FIU's future teaching hospital, all over the place with urgent care centers, ERs and medical offices. The newest location is a freestanding ER in Miami Lakes, which offers the same emergency care as a hospital ER, but usually has shorter wait times and is not physically connected to the hospital. 

“It's demand and supply,” said Parekh, the UHealth executive. UHealth noticed many of its patients lived in Doral and were trekking across South Florida's congested roadways to seek care at its centers in Miami and Coral Gables, with some even going as far as Broward County.

“The constant feedback we received from the community was that they wished that UHealth had a presence in Doral,” Parekh said. Doral's “culture of live, work, play is such an integral part of this community ... we decided it was time for the University of Miami Health System to really make a significant presence in the community.”

It's not just hospitals trying to gain ground in Doral. Leon Medical Centers vans drive around town, taking seniors to and from its Doral center. Sanitas Medical Center, which houses health insurer Florida Blue's center, and other doctor offices and medical centers are scattered across the city. Dentists, orthodontists, physical therapists, plastic surgeons have moved in. Companies that specialize in biotechnology, medical equipment and other health-related products and services are also setting up shop in Doral's warehouses, according to Pila.

Like the rest of Miami-Dade County, small businesses make up the majority of Doral's commerce, although you'll also find chain restaurants, hotels and other large companies scattered across the city including Walmart, Amazon, Carnival Corp. and Trump National Doral within the boundaries. The healthcare and social assistance areas, along with professional, scientific and technical services are part of the city's top industries for employment.

“Doral has a unique blend,” said Peavy, noting that the centrally located city is continuing to see growth in its high-rise and multi-family market, while also maintaining a robust market for manufacturing and other businesses.

And Doral's economy is continuing to see growth in industries that require employees to have a high level of skill and knowledge, according to a 2024 economic analysis report prepared for the city in partnership with Florida International University's Jorge M. Pérez Metropolitan Center. This includes the science and healthcare field, which the city is keen on attracting because of the opportunities for high-paying jobs and other economic growth, the report states.

Doral's proximity to Miami International Airport is why BioTissue in 2012 opened its production facility in the city when it decided to leave Kendall and expand its operations, said Michael Cornelius, the company's chief financial officer.

BioTissue, formerly known as TissueTech, specializes in re-purposing donated birth tissue —umbilical cords, placenta, ambiotic fluid, and other tissue that is traditionally discarded after live birth — to create medical products that can help treat and speed up recovery for eye conditions, burns, wounds and injuries. Birth tissue is often used in reconstructive procedures and is known to help reduce pain, inflammation, and scar formation. 

Birth tissue-products are stored at below freezing temperatures to retain their viability and effectiveness and are also shipped in special containers. That's why being near the airport is key to operations, the executive said.

“We have patients all around the country. So, getting from production to Miami airport on a FedEx plane and to Memphis overnight and then out to various hospitals and doctors offices, next day, is really important for us,” Cornelius said.

But finding space to build isn't the only challenge in Doral.

The city is “over-burdened” by road congestion, according to FIU's economic report. 

So, no matter that medical centers are moving closer to the people, one problem persists:

Traffic is a headache.

LEXINGTON, Ky. (March 24, 2025) — Children's Miracle Network Hospitals (CMNH) announced today that its partners raised a record $2,318,299.22 for Kentucky Children's Hospital (KCH) in 2024. The amount is up 23% from last year's total. 

CMNH community partners such as Speedway, Walmart and Dairy Queen answered the call to support the Commonwealth's most vulnerable patients. Each of those companies are deeply embedded in the communities they serve. To those partners, the Kentucky families served by CMNH and KCH aren't just customers, they are friends and neighbors. 

“Knowing that the dollars donated at our registers, and raised through the events our associates loving put together each year, stay local at KCH means everything to us,” said Jaime Campbell, regional market manager for Walmart.  

“Our mission to provide the best care for children is made possible by the generosity of our community,” said Scottie B. Day, M.D., physician-in-chief at KCH. “This support directly benefits our young patients and their families, giving them hope and healing.” 

Funds raised by Children's Miracle Network partners support several projects at KCH, including animal therapy, providing sensory items to clinics and lifesaving research.  

More than 30 partner companies support Kentucky Children's Hospital through CMNH campaigns, such as selling Miracle Balloons, hosting events and asking customers to “round up” or donate change at their cash registers.   

Funds raised by CMNH partners have transformed spaces in the hospital and pediatric specialty clinics, named for community partners including Speedway, Walmart and McLane. Those funds also supported new ambulance transports that are specially designed and equipped for pediatric patients. 

UK HealthCare is the hospitals and clinics of the University of Kentucky. But it is so much more. It is more than 10,000 dedicated health care professionals committed to providing advanced subspecialty care for the most critically injured and ill patients from the Commonwealth and beyond. It also is the home of the state's only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, a Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit that cares for the tiniest and sickest newborns, the region's only Level 1 trauma center and Kentucky's top hospital ranked by U.S. News & World Report. 

As an academic research institution, we are continuously pursuing the next generation of cures, treatments, protocols and policies. Our discoveries have the potential to change what's medically possible within our lifetimes. Our educators and thought leaders are transforming the health care landscape as our six health professions colleges teach the next generation of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health care professionals, spreading the highest standards of care. UK HealthCare is the power of advanced medicine committed to creating a healthier Kentucky, now and for generations to come.

Recruiting and retaining allied healthcare professionals in long-term care have been at the forefront across the sector since the start of the pandemic. One company that has been training certified nurse assistants, medical assistants, pharmacy assistants and others for a decade and a half recently spoke with the McKnight's Business Daily.

MedCerts provides programs for prospective allied healthcare professionals to earn their credentials without earning a two- to four-year college degree.

Chief Product Officer Dana Janssen told the McKnight's Business Daily that Michigan-based MedCerts was one of the first traditional online or e-learning providers in the country 15 years ago.

“We had a running start before the pandemic, and of course, once the pandemic hit, it did two things. It inspired a lot of other schools to make the transition to online,” he said. “But one of the biggest benefits, if you want to call it a benefit, of the pandemic was far greater acceptance of online training within Allied Health, because traditionally there was some pushback on can you actually teach these skills, clinical skills, in an online way.”

“Quite frankly, because we had that running start, we had already invested in a number of different types of training that are highly digitized, highly engaging and immersive, where we simulate clinical skills being performed,” he said.

MedCerts CEO Craig Sprinkle said the company's online training programs are flexible and make it easier for people to get the skills and certifications they need for healthcare jobs. 

“This opens doors for students while also helping employers fill critical roles faster,” he said. “And really, whenever you focus on where the majority of the vacancies are and dig into that a little bit more, it's in those frontline allied healthcare professions that, frankly, are the backbone of patient care at the end of the day.

Dana Janssen added that 60% of all healthcare workers are allied healthcare professionals.

Regarding labor challenges faced by operators, Sprinkle said, he believes that there are plenty of individuals willing to learn to step into roles in allied healthcare.

“It's just being able to connect those learners with the opportunities to be able to obtain the training that then prepares them to step into the roles that are in demand,” he said.

According to Sprinkle, there is a “general misconception” that the only path, in terms of making a step into healthcare, is via a two-or a four-year degree. Training such as that offered by MedCerts, he said, is more specialized and more targeted, which “really helps that person more seamlessly step into those professions more so than somebody that's gone to school for two years, somebody that's gone to school for four years.”

MedCerts enrollees must be high school graduates or the equivalent or have a parent's signature to participate in a program. Although high school students can't sit for a certification exam until they graduate, they can take the exam as soon as they graduate and then enter the allied healthcare workforce immediately.

On average, Sprinkle said, the programs take five to six months to complete, with an average cost of $4,000.

That doesn't necessarily mean a student needs to pony up $4,000 in tuition, Janssen said. The company partners with healthcare employers around the country, and if an employer is sponsoring a program, then tuition generally is covered by the employer, either through tuition assistance or tuition reimbursement programs.

MedCerts' online programs are self-paced, allowing students to progress independently on their own schedule. The clinical portions are overseen by healthcare facilities that partner with MedCerts to provide hands-on training opportunities, Sprinkle said.

A decade-long study of over 48,000 workers reveals that sticking to optimal lifestyle habits dramatically lowers the risk of several major cancers—especially for those with chronic inflammation.

The “Life's Essential 8” (LE8) is a comprehensive lifestyle assessment tool designed by the American Heart Association to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by improving lifestyle habits.

A team of researchers from China recently assessed the impact of LE8 score trajectories over time on the risk of cancer among individuals working at a Chinese coal mining company. They found promising outcomes in participants with stably elevated LE8 scores. The study is published in the journal Scientific Reports.

Participants with higher LE8 scores were less likely to have diabetes, high blood pressure, or fatty liver disease at the start of the study.

The “Life's Essential 8” (LE8) covers eight key lifestyle factors: diet quality, physical activity, nicotine exposure, sleep health, body weight, blood glucose, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. LE8-based evaluation and optimization of these factors have been found to significantly reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Since lifestyle habits and risk factors fluctuate over time due to life transitions, health conditions, or aging, a dynamic assessment of lifestyle factors over a long period of time is considered to be a more accurate alternative to single assessments that capture data only at a specific point.

LE8 trajectory modeling—a statistical method using latent mixture models to identify patterns of change over time—is a dynamic tool that monitors individuals' lifestyle and health metrics over time to overcome the limitations associated with clinical decision-making or the development of lifestyle recommendations based on static data.

A growing body of evidence indicates that each LE8 component can profoundly influence the risk factors associated with cancer development and progression. Given these associations, researchers hypothesized that long-term adherence to LE8 guidelines might be more beneficial for cancer prevention than shorter periods of adherence or suboptimal compliance.

With this hypothesis, they designed this study to explore the direct relationship between LE8 score trajectories over time and the risk of incident cancer in a comprehensive, prospective cohort study.

The strongest cancer-preventive effects were seen in people who had both high LE8 scores and elevated levels of inflammation, suggesting lifestyle choices may help offset biological risk.

The study included 48,330 participants from the Kailuan study who underwent three health examinations between 2006 and 2010 to determine their LE8 scores. The Kailuan study is a prospective cohort study conducted in Tangshan, China. Since June 2006, the study has included 101,510 active employees and retirees from the Kailuan Group Co., Ltd., which produces coal and chemical industrial products.

The LE8 scores of the participants were calculated using the algorithm proposed by the American Heart Association for all eight LE8 metrics. Based on their composite scores, participants were categorized into three levels: high, moderate, and low.
Cancer cases were identified using multiple methods, including biennial self-reports, medical reports, and hospital discharge summaries. However, lifestyle data were primarily self-reported, which may introduce recall bias.

The study identified three distinct LE8 score trajectories between 2006 and 2010, including the low-stable, moderate-stable, and elevated-stable trajectories. The low-stable trajectory included 21% of participants with persistently low LE8 scores; the moderate-stable trajectory included 49% of participants with persistently moderate LE8 scores; and the elevated-stable trajectory included 29% of participants with persistently high LE8 scores.

The study identified 2,306 new cancer cases during the 10.39-year (mean) follow-up period. The analysis controlling for potential confounding factors, including age, sex, and lifestyle behaviors, revealed that participants with higher LE8 scores had significantly lower overall cancer risks.

Although LE8 includes diet, the study lacked detailed nutrition data, so researchers used salt and tea consumption as rough indicators of dietary habits.

Specifically, participants from moderate-stable and high-stable trajectories exhibited a 15% and 21% lower risk of overall cancer, respectively, compared to those from the low-stable trajectory.

Regarding specific cancer types, the study found that participants with persistently moderate LE8 scores have 49% and 34% reduced risks of developing breast and liver cancers, respectively, compared to those with persistently low LE8 scores.

Similarly, participants with persistently high LE8 scores exhibited 27%, 51%, 31%, and 39% reduced risks of lung, breast, colorectal, and liver cancers, respectively. However, in sensitivity analyses, the reduced risk for liver cancer in the elevated-stable group was no longer statistically significant after excluding participants using medications (e.g., antihypertensives) or those diagnosed within the first year.

Notably, the study found that the reduced breast cancer risk due to persistently elevated LE8 scores was more pronounced in participants with increased serum C-reactive protein levels (a systemic marker of inflammation). This finding indicates that inflammation can potentially influence the association between LE8 score trajectories and cancer risk.

Air pollution exposure—a known risk factor in industrial settings like coal mining—was analyzed as a potential confounder but did not weaken the link between LE8 and reduced lung cancer risk.

The study finds that maintaining persistently elevated LE8 scores over a period of four years can significantly reduce the overall cancer risk, as well as specific risks against lung, breast, colorectal, and liver cancers.

Similarly, maintaining persistently moderate LE8 scores over the same period has been found to significantly reduce the overall cancer risk, as well as specific risks against breast and liver cancers.

Moderate-to-high LE8 scores indicate a healthy lifestyle characterized by nutrient-rich dietary habits, regular physical activity, and adequate, high-quality sleep. All these factors are vital for maintaining a healthy body weight, blood glucose and cholesterol level, and overall metabolic homeostasis. Such metabolic improvements might be responsible for the inverse association observed between LE8 scores and cancer risk.

Smoking cessation is another critical component of LE8 that can potentially reduce the risk of exposure to carcinogens and, thus, can reduce the risk of cancer development.

However, the study has limitations: the cohort was geographically limited to a single industrial community in China, which may affect generalizability; dietary data were not comprehensively assessed (e.g., specific nutrient intake); lifestyle metrics relied on self-reports, which are subject to recall bias; and critical cancer-specific factors (e.g., reproductive history for breast cancer) were not analyzed. Additionally, LE8 trajectories remained relatively stable over time, potentially reflecting the health-conscious nature of the cohort.

Overall, the study findings underscore the importance of integrating LE8 into public health and clinical strategies for cancer prevention.

Emma Raducanu takes on Amanda Anisimova in Miami Open last 16 on Monday; watch all the action from the ATP and WTA Tours on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Emma Raducanu says she does not need "to be told what to do" as she heads into her last-16 tie at the Miami Open. 

Raducanu looked impressive in every department as she dismantled a beleaguered McCartney Kessler, with the American calling it quits midway through the second set on Sunday.

Raducanu was leading 6-1 3-0 when Kessler called for the physio and then decided to retire due to a lower back injury.

The British No 2 recovered from dropping her opening service game to win the next eight games before Kessler packed her bags.

Raducanu backed up her stunning victory over Emma Navarro - her third against a top-10 player in her career - to set up a last-16 meeting with Amanda Anisimova, who upset Indian Wells champion Mirra Andreeva with a 7-6 (7-5) 2-6 6-3 win.

Raducanu is scheduled to play Anisimova from around 7pm on Monday, live on Sky Sports Tennis.

"I think it's a different approach this week," said Raducanu, who last week ended her brief partnership with coach Vladimir Platenik.

"When I'm playing my best tennis I'm really expressing my personality. I'd say I'm a bit of a free spirit, so I don't need restrictions or being told what to do.

"I think when I'm being really authentic, that's when I'm playing my best."

She added: "My movement is pretty good right now. I think I'm defending better and I'm returning really well. I'm pretty happy with most areas of my game. It's just something that I'm looking to try and keep improving, which will set up some stability."

Speaking to Gigi Salmon, Raducanu said: "I was happiest with my focus. That's such a big part of tennis and especially in a match like this.

"I'm in the third round and I haven't been at this stage of a tournament in a while, so I'm very happy with that.

"I returned really well so from the first point in the match I was putting pressure on her serve, and I was imposing myself and my game from the first ball, and trying to get used to the conditions match by match.

"I'm really proud of myself, my team, the work we've been putting in and the kind of environment we've been building."

Raducanu feels the hard work she has put in with renowned fitness trainer Yutaka Nakamura is starting to pay off.

"I haven't had any major injuries, which is the biggest struggle I've had in the past few years, and touch wood my body's OK right now," she said.

"Also the movement in the corners, I'm getting to a lot more balls, and just by practising it and challenging myself to get to each ball, I think I'm developing the confidence and the hand skills to do something with it while I'm there as well.

"I'm happy to have put together a few good performances in a row and whoever I play in the next match I'm sure to be an underdog, but I will relish that."

Annabel Croft speaking to Sky Sports Tennis after Raducanu defeated Kessler:

"It was absolutely breathtaking right from the word go, just middling the ball, just beautiful ball-striking.

"Those returns of serve got into the head of her opponent. She just started outhitting her after one long exchange early on.

"You could just see the evaporation of confidence down at the other end. I don't think I've ever seen her play quite that well the way that she did for those nine games."

Six-time champion Novak Djokovic moved past old rival Rafael Nadal and onto a record 411 ATP Masters 1000 wins with a straight-sets victory over Argentine lucky loser Camilo Ugo Carabelli.

Djokovic had gone level with Nadal after a routine triumph over Rinky Hijikata on Friday and followed it up with an equally comprehensive 6-1 7-6 (7-1) win on Sunday.

The world No 5 sent down 10 aces in a match that lasted an hour and 46 minutes to set up a last-16 tie with Lorenzo Musetti.

"It's an honour to have another milestone, to have another record broken. There's always something on the line pretty much every time I play and of course that motivates me to do well in the tournament," Djokovic told Sky Sports Tennis.

Musetti progressed past Felix Auger-Aliassime in a hard-fought 4-6 6-2 6-3 battle, but ninth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas was knocked out by Sebastian Korda in a 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 score.

Elsewhere, fifth seed Casper Ruud advanced with a 6-4 7-6 (7-4) win over Alejandro Tabilo but 12th seed Tommy Paul was knocked out by 23rd seed Francisco Cerundolo, going down 6-2 7-6 (7-4).

Jamie Delgado, the coach of Grigor Dimitrov, told Sky Sports Tennis of Djokovic's chances in Miami: "In Australia, I thought he had a great chance to win. He was obviously hurt but he still beat [Carlos] Alcaraz in a quarter-final match.

"I think he would have been in a final had he not been injured and in a one-off final he would have had to play [Jannik] Sinner on a hardcourt - it's tough - but I fancy his chances in those matches.

"I think Wimbledon would be his biggest chance."

Delgado, who also coached Andy Murray from 2016-21, also spoke about the player-coach partnership which is set to continue up until Wimbledon and potentially beyond.

He said: "Andy's got an amazing tennis brain and he's played Novak. He knows what it's like to play against other opponents and he's also played against all the youngsters, Alcaraz and Sinner.

"From a tactical point of view I think he can be very helpful for Novak."

Colin Fleming on commentary said: "I have to believe there is an element of Murray wanting to pull back the curtain and see how Djokovic does it. There must be an element of intrigue there, I think.

"Andy is pulling for someone in his era in a way. It's an intriguing coaching challenge for him.

"There's potential for Djokovic come Roland Garros, Wimbledon and US Open this year. He's in the mix."

Former champion Iga Swiatek earned a 7-6 (7-2) 6-1 win over Elise Mertens that made the Polish second seed the first player to reach the last 16 of a WTA 1000 event in 25 consecutive appearances.

Swiatek offered a revealing look at her emotional state in recent months in a lengthy social media post on Monday that also discussed online criticism she received for nearly hitting a ball boy by striking a ball in anger between points.

The post also touched on her doping suspension, coming to grips with knowing she might not return to world No 1 this season and opened up on the fact she spent "three weeks crying daily".

Speaking to Sky Sports' Gigi Salmon, she said: "I explained why my frustrations were a bit higher during the past months. It's hard to say it silenced the noise because during tournaments I'm mentally off. I'm not checking what's going on the internet but in Poland it's not easy sometimes.

"I think abroad more people are distant to what's going on with players and athletes overall. At home they like to focus on every little thing that went wrong, so I just wanted them to know that this is not the perfect way to support me but I know there are fans that are supportive.

"This post was for them to explain why I was a little frustrated and what was in my head the last month. I just wanted to let it go and focus on the future.

"I feel a bit better and I feel like I can just do my job, and not be under so much pressure and scrutiny. I will assess the situation after the tournament when I actually go on the internet."

Up next for Swiatek will be a clash with Ukrainian 22nd seed Elina Svitolina, a 6-2 3-6 6-2 winner over Czech 15th seed Karolina Muchova.

Australian Open champion Madison Keys was dumped out, falling 6-4 6-2 to Filipino wildcard Alexandra Eala.

Up next for Eala, who has trained at Rafa Nadal's academy in Mallorca since she was 13, will be Spanish 10th seed Paula Badosa, a 6-3 7-6 (7-3) winner over Dane Clara Tauson.

Mumbai: Taking tennis' governing bodies to court was “not our first choice” but one that eventually “we felt like, and players felt like, was the only choice” to “reform tennis from within”, Ahmad Nassar, executive director of the Novak Djokovic co-founded Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA), told HT in an interview. 

Last Tuesday, the PTPA filed a lawsuit against the men's (ATP) and women's (WTA) tours, along with the ITF and ITIA, over the way professional tennis is run. It shook the tennis world and elicited varied views from top players. 

Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek distanced themselves from it; world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff acknowledged the issue of higher revenue percentage from prize money for players; Djokovic, the body's co-founder, said there were parts of the 163-page lawsuit that he agreed with and did not, but added that he has “always fought for better representation, influence and positioning of the players globally in our sport, which is still not where it should be”. 

Nassar, PTPA's executive director since 2022, said they “started to see some real themes” around the primary issues while speaking to players. Schedule, player compensation, and overall player exploitation were the most consistent. 

The tennis calendar, most players have concurred, is too long and hectic. The governing bodies have reportedly mulled a restructuring of the tour, known as “premium tour”, with streamlined calendar and larger pay. Nothing official has come out so far. 

“Everybody is kind of stuck. We hope these legal actions will get everyone unstuck and moving in the right direction,” Nassar told HT. 

“The schedule is a complete inefficient grind. You have tournaments 12 months of the year. No other sport does that.” 

On compensation, the lawsuit mentions that the tours “split less than 20% of their revenue with players”. Although the tours and Grand Slams have frequently raised the prize money pot over the years, Forbes's 2024 list of the world's highest-paid athletes (on- and off-field earnings) does not feature a tennis player in the top 50. 

“At the higher end, the highest earning tennis player last year made something like what the 150th NBA player made, even though tennis is a global sport. The ratio of sponsorship dollars that these players generate to their earnings on court, it's nowhere near what a LeBron (James) or a (Lionel) Messi is earning,” Nassar said. 

“And then at the lower end, how could a sport that is played by millions of people globally only have a 100 or so players being net positive (in income) every year?” 

Djokovic has spoken about tennis having “less than 500 players” overall that are able to make a living out of it, and how most in the 250-500 rankings bracket — most Indian pros are in it — are unable to afford a coach on the tour. “This system, it's a pyramid, and it has to work for everybody in it,” Nassar said. 

He highlighted the anti-doping systems and different balls “week to week and tournament to tournament” among other prominent player concerns. 

The lawsuit advocates for a free market, without the financial caps and restricted opportunities to play and earn beyond the tours. Wouldn't that, however, run the risk of having no checks and balances? Nassar pointed to similar lawsuits in the NBA in the 1970s and NFL in the 90s. 

“In NBA, the issue was the player draft. The NBA had that, and still do. But it's part of the system that was challenged and changed. In NFL, it was about free agency. Everyone felt it would be anarchy. Not only did it go through, it empowered massive growth in NFL. That's our hope for tennis,” he said. 

Apart from Djokovic, who co-founded the body with Vasek Pospisil in 2020, PTPA has some well-known current players in its executive committee, including former top-10 Ons Jabuer and Hubert Hurkacz. “This is a player-formed and player-led group. They're all very involved in everything we do, and supportive,” Nassar said. 

The governing bodies have collectively responded in defence. The ATP said they “strongly reject the premise of the PTPA's claims, believe the case to be entirely without merit, and will vigorously defend our position”. As the legal battle plays out, Nassar hoped for a negotiated settlement as the ideal solution. 

“A settlement that addresses all these problems to the satisfaction of players. And enables tennis to sustainably grow and take its rightful place alongside other global sports, which supports thousands of professional players and generates billions of dollars from incremental revenue.”

NORFOLK, Va. – Dominic Manilla, the Old Dominion alumnus who has built ODU's women's tennis program into one of the nation's best, will be presented the J. Roy Rodman Award given by the Norfolk Sports Club to its choice as Virginia's best collegiate coach.

He will receive the award at the sports club's 78th jamboree on Wednesday, April 23, at Chartway Arena. Former ODU women's basketball star Nancy Lieberman will be the featured speaker.

Manilla's teams have won four consecutive conference championships – two in Conference USA and two in the Sun Belt – and his Monarchs are generally ranked among the top 35 programs in the country.

ODU has made the last five NCAA tournaments, a run that began with an at-large bid in 2019. 

An ODU player has been named conference player of the year the last five seasons, and five of the last six years, Manilla has been named conference coach of the year. Five players he coached have participated in the NCAA Singles Tournament, including Sofia Johnson, who ranked as high as No. 7 in the country this spring. 

He says the Norfolk Sports Club Award “is the most meaningful coaching award I've ever received,” Manilla said. “It's such a prestigious award and I'm just so grateful and honored.”

The award, named for the late Portsmouth businessman and philanthropist, has a distinguished list of past winners, including then Virginia Tech football coach Frank Beamer, Virginia basketball coach Tony Bennett, ODU men's basketball coaches Paul Webb, Sonny Allen and Jeff Jones and ODU women's basketball coaches Wendy Larry and Marianne Stanley.

Norfolk Sports Club Vice President Jack Ankerson, who heads the sports club award committee, and Carolyn Crutchfield, ODU's executive senior associate athletics director, met Manilla at his office to tell him about the award.

“That was really special for Jack and Carolyn to take the time to do that,” he said.

“When she (Crutchfield) called, I was thinking, ‘Oh no, is there a problem?' But she told me that all is good, and I was overwhelmed when they told me the news.

“For Jack to come here and tell me personally, that was so classy.”

Manilla, 39, is a native of Nelson County, Virginia who cut his teeth playing tennis. His father, Ron Manilla, is a long-time tennis pro in the Charlottesville area and his brother, Josef Manilla is a former college assistant coach.

“He has a distinct pedigree as he comes from tennis royalty,” said Bruce Stewart, ODU's deputy athletic director and COO who is the administrator for men's and women's tennis.

Manilla walked-on at ODU without a scholarship and played for the late Darryl Cummings, the long-time men's and women's coach at ODU. He was a young assistant coach at ODU when Cummings announced he would retire.

Cummings advised him to leave ODU to gain more experience.

By then, Manilla had caught the eye of John McEnroe, the fiery former American tennis star who won six Grand Slam singles events. Manilla went to work with McEnroe at his tennis academy on Randall's Island in New York City.

Part of the interview process with McEnroe was to play a few rounds of tennis with him.

“That was one of the coolest moments of my life,” Manilla said.

But then he received a call from Stewart, who told him he was on a short list of people being considered to replace Cummings. Stewart chaired the selection committee that would hire both the men's and women's tennis coaches.

Grey Folkes and Ricky Stevens, for whom ODU's Folkes-Stevens Tennis Center is named, were on the selection committee. The committee selected Manilla as the new ODU women's coach.

"Dom was critical because he could connect the dots and was ingrained with the ODU tennis community, as well as past alums," Stewart said. "He had worked and played under Darryl and understood the collegiate tennis landscape.”

Manilla praised Dr. Wood Selig, ODU's director of athletics, who in his first year at ODU, agreed to put more resources into both the men's and women's programs, including restructuring the program by hiring dedicated coaches for both the men and women.

“Wood and Bruce, they've always had my back,” Manilla said. “They've provided the resources for us to become successful. Wood has been extremely supportive. I couldn't ask for better bosses.

"I've always appreciated Bruce's guidance and leadership over the years. His impact, you can't put into words.

“I would jump through fire for that guy.”

“I told Bruce, if I'm going to coach at ODU, we're not just going to be good. We're going to be great," Manilla added 

“I'm pleased with what we've done. We've worked hard. But I feel like we can get better, that we can and will do more.”

ODU's program is envy of most mid-major schools, and mid-major, is a term he doesn't like. “We feel like we've proven we are a power program,” he said.

Manilla, now in his 14th season, is 210-94 at ODU and a lot of those victories have come against Power 4 schools. Since 2017-18, ODU has won 29 matches against Power 4 schools, including victories over Baylor, Notre Dame, Virginia, Virginia Tech, Maryland, LSU, Iowa State, Missouri, Wisconsin, Penn State, Georgia Tech, Ole Miss, Florida State, and Kansas.

The Monarchs defeated South Carolina the last two years in the NCAA Tournament and also defeated Arkansas, 4-2, in the 2021 NCAA Tournament.

Virginia Beach businessman Brad Hobbs, a Virginia Tech graduate and booster, met Manilla's father when his kids were training in Charlottesville.

“He asked me, ‘Do you know my son?' I didn't but then I met Dom and began to watch what he's doing with ODU,” Hobbs said.

“I've since become very involved with ODU tennis. Over the years, I've donated about $150,000 to the program and that's because of Dom. He's an incredible fundraiser. He's so passionate about his program and his girls.

“To have a Top 35 program year after year at ODU is quite an achievement. And it's all Dom. People don't understand how hard it is to do that year after year. People don't understand what he goes up against.

“He's goes toe to toe with the biggest programs in the country and holds his own. He's just an amazing coach.”

His teams have been just as successful in the classroom. Every scholarship tennis player Manilla signed has graduated and generally, his team is among the most successful on campus academically.

Women's tennis had the best grade-point-average among ODU's 18 athletics teams in 2023-24.

Manilla has also developed a close relationship with men's coach Dominik Mueller, whose program has won the last two Sun Belt titles and has also had great success against Power 4 programs.

Mueller's team is ranked 59th nationally, just behind North Carolina and ahead of Northwestern and Notre Dame.

“Dominik and I work together well,” Manilla said. “We feed off each other's success.”

ODU's Folkes-Stevens Tennis Center, a 74,000 square foot center with eight indoor and 12 outdoor courts, has helped both the men's and women's programs compete at the highest level.

Few mid-major programs have such outstanding tennis facilities.

"I look at the Folkes-Stevens Tennis Facility as a center of champions," Stewart said. "People who've been to watch our men and women play say it's the best place to watch high-level tennis in the Hampton Roads area."

Manilla hit a home run seven years ago when he hired Yana Sokolenko, who is the associate head coach and a brilliant recruiter. 

A native of Minsk, Belarus, Sokolenko speaks fluent Russian and Spanish and four of ODU's eight players are native Russian speakers.

“Dom and Yana, that's the dynamic duo right there,” Stewart said. “They complement each other very well. And she is a great mentor for these young ladies."

“Yana has been instrumental in our success in recruiting great players from overseas," Manilla aded. "Having someone who grew up close to where you grew up, someone who speaks your language, that means a lot.”

“The thing that makes Dom good,” Stewart added, “is how much he cares and is emotionally invested. When you go to any senior day match, and he speaks about his players, you immediately know why he has garnered so much success.

"He knows his student-athletes on a much deeper level than their mere rankings and he's got a genuine care and concern about their overall well being.”

Manilla is thankful not only for the support he's received from athletics administrators, but also from ODU President Brian O. Hemphill, Ph.D. 

"Dr. Hemphill has been kind enough to have our entire team and the men's teams over to his house after we won Sun Belt championships," Manilla said.

"How many women's tennis teams get that kind of support from their college president? Everyone in our athletics department feels valued and we're so grateful for that."

In the second edition of Second Serve, a weekly snapshot of the tennis tour, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko looks at the talking points from Miami.

In a week where the appetite for revolution has been the hot topic in the tennis world, there is a need to consider evolution for one of the sport's leading young players. 

The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) launching a lawsuit against the governing bodies has largely overshadowed what has happened on court at the Miami Open.

So let's shine a light on Carlos Alcaraz - and the soul-searching he will look to do before starting his European clay-court season - after a surprise early exit to Belgian veteran David Goffin.

Sometimes it is easy to forget how young Alcaraz is given the success he has already achieved.

Bumps in the road are inevitable for a player who does not turn 22 until the start of May - even if he has already won four Grand Slam titles.

That does not stop the inquest, though, after the Spaniard's second straight defeat.

'A poor level from me' - Alcaraz out in Miami second round

Players v tennis tours: why the lawsuit and what next?

Having received a first-round bye, world number three Alcaraz was completely out of sorts - making a host of sloppy mistakes which pointed to a drop in concentration and confidence.

It was a similar story in his Indian Wells semi-final defeat by Britain's Jack Draper just six days earlier.

Four losses in 19 matches - in a season which has included a title win in Rotterdam  - does not suggest the panic button should be pressed yet.

But the pattern of Alcaraz's losses raises concerns. Dominant sets showcasing his shot-making and athleticism are outweighed by ones where he displays vulnerability and nervousness.

The aura of invincibility which he had developed has dropped a notch. Now he's seen as beatable.

Coming from a country with little tennis pedigree, Alexandra Eala is already accustomed to being a trailblazer for the Philippines - even though she is still only 19.

In 2021, Eala became the first Filipino to win a WTA Tour match and the first to win a junior Grand Slam crown with the 2022 US Open title.

The triumph even led to the teenager gracing the cover of Vogue back home.

Now she has announced herself to a wider global audience, having beaten Australian Open champion Madison Keys to reach the Miami last 16.

"It's a big thing to take in," said Eala, who has jumped 23 places in the live WTA rankings to a career-high 117th.

"I'm so super proud of what I was able to accomplish, but it definitely fuels me more."

Next she faces Spanish 10th seed Paula Badosa and another eye-catching win will put her into the top 100.

All eyes remain on Miami.

The combined ATP Masters and WTA 1,000 event - played in the tier of tournaments below the four majors - hits the business end this week. 

With Alcaraz, Draper and Daniil Medvedev among a host of top-10 seeds already out, the men's draw has opened up and thrown up the possibility of another first-time Masters champion.

Or it could be Novak Djokovic...

Having cut a forlorn figure after a "bad day in the office" at Indian Wells, the 24-time major champion has looked more like his old self in Miami.

Biggers tests await than Australia's Rinky Hijikata and Argentine lucky loser Camilo Ugo Carabelli - starting with Italy's Lorenzo Musetti in the last 16 -  but he is certainly sharper having benefitted from more time on the court.

The top four seeds remain in the women's draw - Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula, as does defending champion Danielle Collins.



Alcaraz's struggle to find consistency demonstrates - if we didn't already know - how hard it is for the world's leading players to replicate their best every week.

Jack Draper received a reminder in Miami, too.

Fresh from lifting the Indian Wells title, the British men's number one was brought back down to earth with an opening defeat by talented Czech 19-year-old Jakub Mensik.

More positively, Emma Raducanu answered some of the sceptics with an impressively gritty win over eighth seed Emma Navarro and is aiming to reach the quarter-finals of a WTA 1,000 event for the first time.

The warp-speed rise of Jacob Fearnley is showing no signs of stopping yet.

As we keep reminding you, the 23-year-old was still a university student in the United States this time last year and ranked outside of the world's top 500.

Now he has provisionally become the British men's number two - overtaking former world number eight Cameron Norrie - and is on course to become a top-75 player when the rankings are updated next week.

Norrie has plummeted outside the top 80 as his struggles continue, while Dan Evans - playing this week at an ATP Challenger in Naples - is on the verge of dropping out of the top 200. 

With so many professional tennis tournaments taking place across the world, and across so many levels, it can be hard to keep up with everything from one week to the next.

As part of BBC Sport's commitment to offer more for tennis fans, Second Serve will be your weekly round-up of the biggest stories in the sport.

As well as the main talking point, you can see which ATP and WTA players are making significant progress - or struggling for form, how the British contingent are doing and what the next stops on the calendars are.

WATCH NOW: Sports round-up as Emma Raducanu impresses at Miami Open

The Australian has praised the 22-year-old amid her excellent form in America

Nick Kyrgios has leapt to Emma Raducanu's defence during her impressive run at the Miami Open.

The Australian took to social media to support the British star amid her recent coaching changes.



"People awfully quiet that Radacanu is winning now. Where all the experts at now? Lol coach's overrated," Kyrgios wrote.

The 2022 Wimbledon finalist has famously never employed a coach during his professional career.

He appeared to revel in the fact that Raducanu's superb Miami performance coincided with her not having an official trainer.

Kyrgios himself reached the second round in Miami, winning a professional singles tennis match for the first time since October 2022.

His comments came after Raducanu parted ways with coach Vlado Platenik after just two weeks and one match.

Raducanu, 22, has endured a difficult start to 2025 both on and off the court.

The Brit won just three of her first nine matches this year, suffering early exits in Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Doha and Indian Wells.

Nakashima has to be one of the most underrated players in the game. Also people awfully quiet that radacanu is winning now - where all the experts at now? lol coach's overrated 😅

She also faced a horrific public stalking ordeal when a man displaying "fixated behaviour" followed her across the world.

The stalker handed her a letter in Dubai before appearing in the crowd the next day.

Amid these troubles, Raducanu took a break from Instagram.

Her coaching situation has been equally turbulent. Nick Cavaday stepped away for health reasons.

She briefly worked with Tom Welsh before bringing in Platenik on a trial basis.

However, Raducanu ended this arrangement by phone after just two weeks.

The split came the night before her first-round match at the Miami Open.

Despite the coaching turmoil, Raducanu has found remarkable form in Miami.

She thrashed Sayaka Ishii 6-2 6-1 in her opening match.

The 2021 US Open champion then secured a significant milestone by recording her first top-ten win off grass.

She outlasted world No 10 Emma Navarro in a thrilling contest, prevailing 7-6 2-6 7-6.

Raducanu's momentum continued in the third round against McCartney Kessler.

Her opponent retired when trailing 6-1 3-0, sending the Bromley star through to the last 16.

This impressive run has set up a clash with No17 seed Amanda Anisimova, with that match set to take place later on Monday.

After Miami, Raducanu will face the challenge of the clay court season.

This surface has traditionally been where the world No 60 has struggled most.

However, there is reason for optimism as she approaches this part of the season with the tennis star starting to rediscover her mojo.

Patrick Mouratoglou has admitted he was ‘surprised' by Carlos Alcaraz's brutally honest comments suggesting he is struggling to deal with the pressures at the top of the sport.

Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz was honest in his post-match press conference following a defeat against Jack Draper at the Indian Wells Masters.

“I always say that I have to be focused on myself, on my own game,” Alcaraz said. “I think today I was more worried about his level, his game, than myself… So when you're thinking more about the opponent than yourself, then it is a big problem.

“So that's what happened. Since the beginning of the day, since the morning, I was thinking about his game, because he's really tough, he's really solid, and it's going to be a really physical match.”

Those words will have been noted by the Draper camp and the next time he plays Alcaraz, the Brit will know his young rival is wary of the threat he can pose.

Now respected coach Mouratoglou has suggested Alcaraz's decision to be so honest about his emotions is a gamble that may backfire on him.

Speaking exclusively to Tennis365 as he releases a compelling book Champion Mindset, the former coach of Serena Williams and current coach to Naomi Osaka admitted Alcaraz's brutal honesty was not the norm for an elite sportsman.

“It was a choice for him to say that. I don't know if it was good or not,” Mouratoglou told Tennis365. “If it helps him to take it out of his system to say it, to admit it, why not?

“Most other players would not say it, that is his choice. We will see how he plays now after he has said this. We will see if he feels less pressure now that he has said this, that he admitted his weakness of that moment.

“Maybe the fact that he verbalised it will put more pressure on him, we'll see. It is unusual to hear this.”

Mouratoglou went on to reflect on a period of Rafael Nadal's career when he also went public with his self-doubt before he returned to Grand Slam-winning ways. 

“I don't know if this is a Spanish thing, but I remember that Rafa had a period in his career when he was losing a lot of matches and he was saying that he kind of lost his mental strength, he admitted it,” he continued.

“I was very surprised when he said this, actually, but then he came back to his true self and it shows that even the great players go through doubts at some points.

“It was the same when I started with Serena. She had not won a Grand Slam for three years, she lost in the first round of Roland Garros and it was a difficult moment. Everyone goes through this at some point in their lives and their career.”

Mouratoglou's book is set to become one of the must-read publications for anyone involved in tennis, with his story revealing how he banished his own insecurities in the formative days of his life to become one of the biggest characters in tennis.

His guide to building self-confidence and climbing your way to the top offers lessons for all in life and not just tennis, which is why Champion Mindset is a book that will reach out to an audience beyond the tennis community.

The 19-year-old Filipina stunned Australian Open champion Madison Keys in one of the biggest upsets of the tournament.ByStephanie LivaudaisPublished Mar 24, 2025 copy_link

Published Mar 24, 2025

MIAMI, FL — Alexandra Eala had barely any time to process her history-making run at the Miami Open presented by Itau, but on Sunday afternoon she already had one thing clear: There's still one more match to prepare for.The big-hitting teenager from the Philippines pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the fortnight as she took down Madison Keys, the reigning Australian Open champion, in straight sets. And it wasn't just the victory, but the way Eala clinched it that turned heads: It was a thrashing as she dismantled Keys' serve, breaking six times on her way to a 6-4, 6-2 victory at the No. 5 seed's home event.Overwhelmed with infectious joy after the monumental win, Eala leaped and ran to celebrate with her team and, during the on-court interview, she sent a tearful shoutout to parents Mike and Rizza, who stayed up until the early morning hours back home to witness the moment: “Mom, dad, I did it… My god!”Read More: Alexandra Eala scores the Philippines' biggest WTA win against Jelena Ostapenko in MiamiBy the time that she'd arrived to the whirlwind of post-match obligations—treatment, recovery, media, press and more—the Quezon City native already seemed eager for the next challenge.“I think every single player here has envisioned themselves as a successful tennis player,” Eala reflected. “This is the goal, to do well on the WTA Tour, to win Slams, to get the rankings.“I think this is a good step towards where I want to be.”

Relishing each ‘step' in the journey, rather than making each milestone a destination: That's been part of the winning mentality that propelled the Filipina out of a country without a solid tennis tradition and turned her into a serious threat to the WTA's upper echelons at just 19.Eala took up tennis at the age of four as a way to bond with her grandfather—a dedicated club player who became a coach to several Eala cousins—as well as her older brother, Miko, who later played tennis for Pennsylvania State University. As her career “blossomed” it soon became clear she had to leave the Philippines and begin training abroad to continue progressing—a daunting prospect for Eala, then a preteen preparing to travel halfway around the world.That's when the Rafa Nadal Academy came knocking.“It came as a shock because I was young. I was 13 when we made that decision,” Eala recalled. “My parents… sent my brother (Miko) along with me, so I still had family close.“It was definitely a big decision for me, for us. But as soon as I heard that, I jumped at the opportunity because I knew that I had to get out of the country eventually to improve.”Read More: Rafael Nadal congratulates academy students Eala, Wong on big Miami wins

Eala thrived in the world-class facilities at the Manacor, Mallorca-based academy founded by the 22-time Grand Slam winner, as she measured her game against top players and current WTA pros, and benefited from invaluable time on the practice court with Nadal himself—a fellow lefty.Read More: Rafael Nadal set for $94-million profit after selling part of his stake in tennis academyShe spent seven years at the academy until her 2023 graduation—which was attended by both Nadal and then WTA world No. 1 Iga Swiatek—when she began competing full-time. Eala continues to train in Mallorca, her primary base during the busy tennis season.“My family should take credit for the foundation that they laid out before they sent me there. But of course, the academy was able to build on that foundation in such a way that I'm able to be where I am now,” the Filipino player said.“I think the combination of everything that I've been through since I started tennis is what has led to this moment and what has led to me having all these opportunities.”

Eala's first win in Miami against Katie Volynets marked a personal milestone, as only her second-ever WTA 1000 level win. Her second made national history, as she defeated Jelena Ostapenko, a former Roland Garros champion, to claim the first Top 30 victory by a player representing the Philippines.Her third-round shocker against Keys could be set to unleash the floodgates of tennis interest back home, especially as Eala could be in the perfect position to capitalize on her chances in the next round. Eala will face snake-bitten No. 10 seed Paula Badosa, who struggled with a resurgence of stubborn low back injury in her 6-3, 7-6 (3) win over Clara Tauson, for a spot in the quarterfinals of a WTA 1000 event.Their match is scheduled for Monday evening in Miami, early Tuesday morning in Manila—just in time for folks back home to tune in over breakfast. Tennis fans have seen the way massive breakthroughs by Li Na and Zheng Qinwen galvanized tennis in China, and even more recently how generational performances by Brazil's Joao Fonseca have turned a soccer-mad population into a crowd of cheering, singing tennis fans. Could Eala do the same for the Philippines?

Eala will face snake-bitten No. 10 seed Paula Badosa, who struggled with a resurgence of stubborn low back injury in her 6-3, 7-6 (3) win over Clara Tauson, for a spot in the quarterfinals of a WTA 1000 event.Their match is scheduled for Monday evening in Miami, early Tuesday morning in Manila—just in time for folks back home to tune in over breakfast. Tennis fans have seen the way massive breakthroughs by Li Na and Zheng Qinwen galvanized tennis in China, and even more recently how generational performances by Brazil's Joao Fonseca have turned a soccer-mad population into a crowd of cheering, singing tennis fans.

While the 19-year-old is well aware of her growing influence back home, the task of inspiring a nation of over 110 million people to sporting glory isn't the type of pressure that she's putting on herself quite yet. Instead, the teenager hopes it will be the natural result of her work ethic and “grit” on the court—just like everything else she's had to work for in her career.“There have been so many role models in my life. Inspiration doesn't always have to come from someone big who did it in the Philippines,” Eala said. “For example, young kids in the Philippines, they don't need to take inspiration from me. They can take inspiration from anyone they want. And they can take inspiration from other things, which is what I did growing up…“I want the kids at home to see more my attitude and the grit I have on court, more than the results that I get.”Currently ranked No. 140 in the world, Eala is projected to rise inside the Top 120 as a result of her Miami progress and would be knocking on the door of the Top 100 should she get past Badosa. She will face the tenth-seeded Spaniard in the last match on Grandstand on Monday.

Teenage tennis prodigy Mirra Andreeva has been subjected to a torrent of vile online abuse following her third-round loss to American Amanda Anisimova at the Miami Open.

The 17-year-old Russian, fresh off back-to-back WTA 1000 victories in Dubai and Indian Wells, went down 7-6 (5), 2-6, 6-3 on Monday.

It derailed an extraordinary 13-match winning-streak that saw her cut a swathe through the biggest names in the sport, beating Elena Rybakina, Elina Svitolina, Iga Swiatek and Arya Sabalenka.

Unfortunately, immediately after the match, Andreeva's social media feed was flooded with hateful comments.

In a now-deleted Instagram post, she shared some of the abuse she received, captioning the screenshot, 'And this is what you get when you lose 1 match'.

'You look@like a man! Wtf! Deserve WORST CANCC3e exist,' posted one person.

'One of the worst player ever,' posted another.

'GO HOME,' posted a third. 

It comes after the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) last year warned that the number of female stars affected by online bullying is on the rise and urged social media bosses to make their platforms safer.

In 2022, British tennis star Emma Raducanu told police she was 'constantly looking over her shoulder' after a besotted former Amazon delivery driver tracked down her address and left notes, flowers and even Christmas decorations.

The 22-year-old's ordeal continued last month in Dubai when another stalker appeared in the crowd during one of her matches leaving the tennis star cowering on the court in tears.

Raducanu has since deleted her Instagram account, which had boasted more than three million followers.

At last year's Wimbledon event, organisers put together a team of investigators to protect players from online abuse, unmask trolls and identify potential stalkers during the tournament.

Monitoring service Threat Matrix used AI to constantly scan content on platforms such as X, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and TikTok for any harmful posts aimed at competitors.

Threat Matrix also offers a unique personalised service which provides support to players who receive abuse or threats via private direct messaging.

The system, which operates in 35 languages, has already worked with players and officials at the Fifa World Cup in Qatar and the Rugby World Cup.

Bosses said they expect some of the worst offenders to be gamblers who are angry they have lost a bet or are attempting to throw a player off their game in order to improve their odds.

“I was happy with the way I was able to fight and stay focused,” the American said after her contentious three-set victory Sunday.BySteve TignorPublished Mar 24, 2025 copy_link

When Amanda Anisinova stepped up to serve at 4-3 in the third set against Mirra Andreeva in Miami on Sunday night, it felt like she was stepping up to a career crossroads as well. Did the former teen prodigy have what it takes to beat the teen prodigy of the moment? Victory was within her grasp. She just needed, as her coach told her more than once, to “be brave” enough to grab it.Andreeva was on a 13-match win streak that had taken her to back-to-back WTA 1000 titles in Dubai and Indian Wells, and made her the talk of the sport. On this night, though, the 17-year-old started the match struggling to breathe because of pain in her stomach, and looking as if she wanted to be anywhere other than Hard Rock Stadium. Her coach, Conchita Martinez, assured her that “it's gonna pass.” The words may have made Andreeva more willing to keep playing, but they didn't seem to make her any happier about it.Exclusive: Coach Conchita Martinez keeps Andreeva groundedRather than giving an advantage to Anisimova, though, Andreeva's issues robbed the match of any flow. Unforced errors sprayed from both players' racquets—there would be 110 of them combined on the evening—and break points were squandered as quickly as they were earned. Andreeva slammed her racquet down after her misses, while Anisimova looked up at the sky in disbelief after hers.

At 4-4, their shots began to click and the rallies sharpened. Anisimova settled in as the attacker and Andreeva as the defender, and they proceeded to a tiebreaker. Once there, it was Anisimova who elevated when it mattered. From 4-3 in the breaker, she forced an error with a forehand, smacked a service winner, and closed the set with a forehand winner.“Of course it wasn't ideal, I think it broke the rhythm of the match a little bit, because we had just started,” Anisimova said of Andreeva's physio visits. “I was trying to pick up my rhythm after that. I was happy with the way I was able to fight and stay focused.”But Andreeva had won too many matches in a row to call it quits that easily. She may be been physically uncomfortable, but mentally she had the confidence of someone who hasn't lost in more than a month. She began to dip into her full repertoire of drops, slices, lobs, moonballs, and winning topspin drives to the corners. When Anisimova failed to put an easy pair of shots away while serving at 2-3, the match turned and Andreeva ran away with the second set.

Even then, though, Andreeva never settled down or seemed calm. After failing to convert a break point early in the third set, she pounded a ball into a side wall and was quietly cautioned by the chair umpire. One game later, she was broken, and one game after that, she failed to convert another break point. By then, she was simmering.With Andreeva serving at 1-3, Anisimova called for a trainer for a blister; that's not normally done in the middle of a game, but it's allowed for an immediate issue. Andreeva, not surprisingly, didn't see it that way.🎥 "I can if it's acute": Anisimova justifies mid-game MTO to Andreeva“We all know why,” Andreeva said to the chair umpire, implying that Anisimova was trying to break her rhythm.“My skin broke on my finger," Anisimova explained afterward. "When you get an acute injury you're allowed to take a timeout, so that's what I did."

Anisimova has never been a confrontational player, but when she won the next point, she reacted with a rare fist-pump. Now the question was whether she could ride her newly contentious energy to a win.She started with a good hold from 15-30 down, to make it 4-2. But she couldn't break from 15-30 up on Andreeva's next service game. That left her serving at 4-3, 15-15.For most of the match, Anisimova had been reluctant to follow her penetrating ground strokes forward, instead taking Andreeva's towering lobs off the bounce. This time, she stepped in and closed with a confident swing-volley winner. Two minutes later, she was up 5-3. Three minutes after that, she had snapped Andreeva's streak with a satisfying 7-6 (5), 2-6, 6-3 win.“We're both big hitters, I knew we would go and have a great match out here,” said Anisimova, who was playing in Miami's main stadium for the first time. “She has a lot of variety in her game, definitely a tricky opponent.”Anisimova's reward is match with the woman who beat her at the Australian Open, Emma Raducanu, on Monday afternoon. We'll see what she can take from her streak-snapping win over Andreeva. This time, Anisimova let her emotions boil up, and transform her into a more aggressive and purposeful player. It shouldn't be the last time.

Sunny Deol is gearing up for his next action drama film Jaat. Finally the makers have released the much-awaited trailer of the film, in which once again Sunny Deol's strong action avatar was seen. The film has been directed by famous South Indian director Gopichand Malineni. However, the makers have yet not revealed the exact release date of this action-drama.


Jaat trailer is out now

Sunny Deol is gearing up for his next action drama film Jaat. His action avatar was seen at the beginning of the trailer. The Jaat trailer begins with Saiyami Khare, who's playing the role of a police officer. She questions the villager about a crime scene police officer. Later one of them yells out the name, 'Ranatunga'. Later Sunny Deol makes an over-the-top but impactful entrance. At the end of the trailer, the veteran actor says, 'The whole North has seen the strength of my Dhai Kilo's hand, now the South will see it.' Along with Randeep Hooda, Chhaava actor Viineet Kumar Siingh will also be seen in the role of an antagonist in this film. 

However, the trailer has too many over-the-top scenes that make it look unbelievable. But seems like this is what attracts viewers nowadays. Hence, Malineni has a screenplay that could attract audiences back into the theatres. 

Watch the trailer here:

Eva Longoria was the "ugly duckling" in her family during her younger years.

The 50-year-old actress has revealed that she didn't look anything like her sisters as a child and she was never considered to be "the pretty one" in her family.

Eva  — who was the youngest of four daughters — said on Today: "I was performative in my family because I was the ugly duckling. Documentation is available if you need it.

"My three sisters look alike. They are all blonde. I knew I wasn't the pretty one and I was like, 'Ok, I'm not the pretty one so I'm going to be the funny one. I'm going to be the smart one.'"

Eva studied kinesiology at a university in Texas, but she eventually found her way to Hollywood.

The brunette beauty explained: "I land in Hollywood and I don't know what happened. I just was like, 'I think I'm going to be an actor.'"

Eva starred on The Young and the Restless, the daytime soap opera, between 2001 and 2003. But she found international stardom in 2004, when she joined the cast of Desperate Housewives, the hit comedy-drama series.

Eva — who played the part of Gabrielle Solis on the ABC series — shared: "By the time I got Desperate Housewives, I remember when it aired, and I was like, 'Mom, you gotta watch, it's called Desperate Housewives.

"She watches and she calls me afterwards. She goes, 'Honey you were in it a lot.' I go, 'Yeah mom, I'm one of the stars.' And she goes, 'Are you going to be in it next week?' [I go], 'Mom I'm going to be on every week.' It was a big adjustment for everybody around me, but not me."

Stand-up comedian and YouTuber Samay Raina has reached Navi Mumbai Cyber ​​Branch for questioning in India's Got Latent controversy. It is significant to note that Samay Raina, who tried to escape from questioning was summoned along with other accused, Ranveer Allahbadia, Ashish Chanchlani and Apoorva Mukhija. The rest have recorded their statements in the past weeks and Raina, who was in America for his stand-up shows reached Cyber Branch on Monday.

For the unversed, Samay Raina and Apoorva Mukhija were earlier ordered to appear before the Maharashtra Cyber Cell on February 17 to record their statements. However, Raina had requested the agency to record his statement through video conferencing as he is in the United States for his shows. The cyber cell rejected his request and new dates were given.

What's the controversy? 

On the comedy reality series, popular among today's youth for its edgy bordering on offensive content, Allahbadia asked a question to a contestant on parents and sex, which has been panned by many and led to a BJP functionary lodging a police complaint here against the makers, judges and participants of the show.

In an apology video on X on Monday, Allahbadia admitted that his comment was not only inappropriate but also not funny. "Comedy is not my forte. Just here to say sorry," the YouTuber, popularly known as BeerBiceps, said in the video. "Many of you asked if this is how I wish to use my platform. Obviously, this is not how I wish to use my platform. I am not going to give any context, justification or reasoning behind whatever happened. I am just here for an apology. I, personally, had a lapse in judgement. It wasn't cool on my part."

Meghan Markle's life in Kensington Palace seemed doomed from the start.

The Duchess of Sussex was accused of having a "messiah complex" by former palace aides, who nicknamed her "Duchess of Difficult" before she made her royal exit.

The claim was made by royal author Tom Quinn, who has written a new book, "Yes Ma'am: The Secret Life of Royal Servants." Quinn spoke to hundreds of former and current palace staff members to learn what it's like to watch over the House of Windsor.

Fox News Digital reached out to Archewell, which handles the offices of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and Kensington Palace for the Prince and Princess of Wales for comment. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace previously told Fox News Digital, "We don't comment on such books."

"Several of the aides that I spoke to, as well as the more junior staff, said that Meghan had what they called a ‘messiah complex,'" Quinn claimed to Fox News Digital.

"I think what they meant was that, as a working royal, she could save all the people whose lives were difficult. She could help with all sorts of problems, including poverty. She had this sense that came from a very good motivation that she could change the world for the better. But the aides saw her ideas of doing good as completely out of proportion to what she actually could do."

"They felt she had these grand ideas, but there was no way a single person could do what she wanted to do," Quinn shared. "And I think there was also a suspicion that Meghan was trying to be more like William and Harry's mother, Princess Diana, that she was trying to do the same thing. And I think there was irritation that her sense of importance would reflect badly on the royal family."

One member of Meghan's former staff claimed that the Duchess of Sussex was "focused on how she could become the best-known and most-loved member of the royal family."

"She once said, ‘What Diana started I want to finish,' and we took that to mean she wanted to become a sort of globetrotting champion of the poor and the marginalized," the ex-aide claimed.

One of Queen Elizabeth II's former courtiers also claimed to Quinn that Buckingham Palace had become "really worried" that Meghan had made her own plans for her life as a working royal. They felt she "wanted to do her own thing," but "it was never going to be acceptable that Meghan should outshine Princess Anne, Prince Charles [as he was then known] and [the queen]."

"Quite rightly, [the queen] always had to be the center and focus of everything the royal family did," the aide claimed, as quoted in Quinn's book.

"I don't think Meghan understood why that had to make her do things she didn't want to do. She didn't understand that when you join the royal family, you don't do as you please, you do as you're told. In a sense, you become a servant of the family."

The aide claimed that Meghan "felt constrained" and started to feel that she and Harry needed to "break out" where they could be working royals but "do their own thing without consulting the big royal machine." For Harry, the idea of freedom sounded enticing, the aide claimed.

Quinn learned that the palace staff begged Harry to intervene. Instead, they began to see his "tendency to defend anything and everything Meghan says or does."

Quinn said he could see how Meghan's ambitions would become a problem.

"If you're married to the spare as Meghan is, you have to… accept that you're taking a backseat position," Quinn told Fox News Digital. "Meghan didn't do that. That led to the idea that she had a ‘messiah complex.' She might have exaggerated her ability to do good, but her desire to do it was very sincere."

Meghan's hugging also became a problem. The over-familiarity was considered "rude" by staff, who claimed that Kate Middleton, Prince William and King Charles III would "flinch" when Meghan moved in for an embrace.

"Tension developed between William and Harry as a result of Meghan's warm, friendly, hug-everyone approach," Quinn wrote.

"It made William uncomfortable because she hugged him virtually every time they bumped into each other; the hugging and cheek kissing fueled gossip among the staff that Meghan was flirting with William, which she was obviously not, but the tense atmosphere caused by all the touchy-feeliness (and the resultant gossip) deepened the rift between the brothers."

Quinn told Fox News Digital while all the staff he spoke to agreed that the rumors were untrue, Kensington Palace was also a "hothouse where gossip and rumors develop."

"These rumors could become a life of their own," he said. "The senior royals have to stop them before they start. Meanwhile, Meghan was upset and felt that the royal family was… pushing her away. I think the fact that Meghan felt slightly rejected was one of the reasons why this whole project [being senior royals] didn't work."

"She was very warm," said Quinn. "Whenever she met other members of the family, she would hug them… the royals just don't do that… Meghan was astonished, for example, that Charles was so formal with his mother. It was as if she couldn't understand why the family was so cold. She came from a tradition where if you met someone close to you, you hugged them."

"Yes, Meghan got very bad press in the U.K.," Quinn continued. "She was nicknamed the Duchess of Difficult by people who worked for her when she was a member of the royal family, and also, by other members of the royal family."

But it wasn't always this way. Quinn pointed out in his book that at first, William and Kate found Meghan "delightful," as quoted by one staffer.

"I actually rather liked Meghan," one staffer told Quinn. "She was very straightforward and matter-of-fact, but some people didn't like that because they felt she had got a bit above herself. Even the kitchen maids, I think, were a bit jealous, which made them very critical of Meghan.

"They liked Harry and felt very protective of him and then along comes this American woman who – they felt – made Harry into a less likable character. But as one of Harry's own friends from the military said, ‘Harry was a man waiting for a woman to mold him, and Meghan was that woman.'"

One former Kensington Palace staffer also claimed to Quinn, "Through absolutely no fault of her own, Meghan wasn't always great with her staff – she just wasn't used to it as Harry was. So, one minute she would be really friendly, perhaps over-friendly, with the staff, hugging everyone and trying to make friends with them, and the next she would be irritated by the fact that they wouldn't respond instantly at all times of the day and night.

"It's true that her nickname for a while was the Duchess of Difficult, but she had other, friendlier nicknames, including Mystic Meg, which came about because she was so New Agey, so woke, about so many things. She could be difficult because she was finding life difficult…"

A former staff member added, "Meghan quite rightly hated the fact that when she was in Nottingham Cottage, she had to agree well in advance what time she might leave for an appointment or an event, and she had to make sure she didn't leave at the same time as, or clash in any way with, a more senior royal leaving the palace."

Quinn wrote that while Meghan had her supporters within the royal household, others struggled to work with her. One senior staff member reportedly remarked, "Oh my God, here we go again – Meghan is Mrs. Simpson come back to haunt us!"

The queen's uncle, Edward VIII, famously gave up the throne in 1936 so he could marry Wallis Simpson, the divorced American socialite.

"In a way, you could argue that Meghan upsetting senior staff and other members of the royal family was actually a good thing," Quinn told Fox News Digital. "It led to what Meghan and Harry saw as their freedom."

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped back as senior royals in 2020. They cited lack of support from the palace as one of their reasons. That year, the couple moved to California, where they're raising their two young children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.

Not only this, MC Stan has also sent a similar message to another influencer named Naila Hussain.

MC Stan is being trolled

These screenshots of Stan's DM are going viral on social media, due to which the rapper is being badly trolled. A user wrote, 'Mil gaya sukoon, karva li beejjati.' Several social media users called the rapper creepy. Another comment read, 'This is a matter of great shame.'

MS Stan was away from social media for this reason

Joe Gatto has been accused of inappropriate conduct for a second time. 

The 48-year-old comedian and former Impractical Jokers star just faced a first accusation of sexual assault on Thursday (March 20), to which he denied any assault.

Now, a former employee is also accusing the comedian, describing her experience as sexual harassment and that he exhibited unwanted behaviors. 

Keep reading to find out more…

This second woman, who was employed by him prior to his exit from Impractical Jokers in 2021, says she first met him when she was just 15 years old, and as soon as she turned 18, his behavior became very flirtatious.

Per People, prior to her starting the job, she was warned by a former employee that “she perceived him to sometimes be flirty and handsy,” and he “often tells inappropriate jokes, and advised her to shut it down immediately if he did anything creepy.” 

The woman said she learned quickly what the warning was for, as during her time working for him, he “occasionally inappropriately grabbed her and asked for back massages,” with him even inviting her to his room once, asking her to cuddle. He even allegedly made frequent inquiries about her sex life.

She claims he often bragged about being in an open relationship with then wife Bessy (they split in 2021), and he would DM her, responding to social media posts calling her “hot” and acting possessive, getting jealous when she posted photos with her boyfriend at the time. 

After rejecting his advances, the woman says he would be rude to her the next day, and she “felt as though she always had to work to keep him at ease, fearing she could lose her job.”

The former employee says there was a larger pattern of emotional manipulation that continued up until she left after two years.

She also alleges that during a work trip, he grabbed her thigh while in an elevator, leading to her moving to the other side of the elevator, and him telling her he knew it would make her uncomfortable. 

On another trip, she says he insisted employees come back to his room and drink, though, she notes he wouldn't drink, just encourage others to drink around him.

Following the first accusations from an account on TikTok, Joe spoke out, releasing a statement where he denied her claims.

“I have used poor judgment and as a result have violated the trust of the people I love most,” Joe shared in a statement via Variety.

“But anyone who knows me at all knows full well that I wouldn't assault anyone,” he continued. “Working on myself is an ongoing process, and I am now going to take some time away from the public eye to focus my energies where I need to.”

Warning: This post may contain spoilers from The White Lotus

Patrick Schwarzenegger and Sam Nivola are opening up about their characters' storyline in the latest episode of The White Lotus. 

In episode five, which aired on March 16th, it was revealed that the two brothers, Saxon and Lochlan, had kissed while partying with Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) and Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood) on Gary's (Jon Gries) super yacht.

This week's episode, "Denials," more from that night was uncovered, and Patrick and Sam are dishing on their characters' reactions and more.

Keep reading to find out more...

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!

In the episode, it was revealed that while Lochlan and Chloe were having sex, Lochlan was also reaching over and jerking off his brother, who was lying in the bed next to them. 

"We all just trusted each other, and that dynamic worked well. In the scene, Patrick and I are brothers, with this girl who we just met like the day before. It was very weird kissing Patrick because he's a really good friend of mine," Sam told Variety. "And, you know, I'm straight, he's straight. It's already weird. It would have been easier if that was the first time we were meeting. Weirdly, it was easier to do things with Charlotte because there were no stakes. It's just this person I've just met. But Patrick was already like a brother to me. It felt sort of f--ked up."

When asked if Lochlan was sexually attracted to his brother, Sam notes he think "it's something else."

"I think it comes from a sense of insecurity. He really looks up to both of his siblings, not from the point of view of a physical attraction. It's more curiosity, and trying to figure out which kind of person he is going to become. He tries to connect with him in whatever way he can," Sam said. "I think Lochlan is a people pleaser, who will try to get people to like him by any means necessary. Looking at Saxon while he's jerking off is not a sexual thing — it's more that he's studying him: 'Who is this guy? How can I get him to like me? How can I become more like him?' What he learns over the first few episodes is that Saxon is the sex guy. His primary motive in life is to make money and get laid. So, the thing on the boat is Lochlan's tragically misguided attempt at being like, 'So, you're the sex guy. Let's do something in that realm and try to connect in some way.' It's obviously a big swing and a miss."

As for Lochlan's sexuality, Sam adds that "Lochlan has such a one-track mind. He wants love and attention — it could be from a guy, it could be from a girl. I don't think he knows what he's attracted to yet. If he finds out he's attracted to men after this season, then it will probably become a problem, given his family being rich, conservative Southerners. But at this time, that's not what's going through his head."

Patrick, on the other hand, says he gasped when he first read the scene. 

"The first time I read it and got to that scene, I thought ‘Oh boy, we've got a wild [ride]. This is classic Mike White, classic White Lotus,” he told The Wrap. “It was going to be this hilarious moment throughout the script that was a big shift and changing point for Saxon, and for Saxon and Lochlan's relationship … and the power shift between the two of them.”

"Mike wants it to be an open-ended conversation for the viewer to come up to their own ideas,” Patrick added about which of them initiated it. “Did Saxon want it? Did he not want it? Does he even remember it? Does he not? Was it the drugs? Was it not? Was is it these girls that pressured him into doing it? Was it not?”

Patrick also talks about how Saxon deals with the aftermath of remember what happened. 

“[He] can't believe what possibly happened, and just feels this inferior back-at-the-bottom-of-the-totem-pole part in his life,” he said. “I think that everything around him and himself feels like is shattering from who he thought he should be.”

Hilaria Baldwin planned to end her relationship with Alec Baldwin if his eldest daughter, Ireland Baldwin, didn't approve.

During the Sunday, March 23, episode of TLC's The Baldwins, Hilaria, 41, reflected on her bond with Ireland, 29,.”I feel like it is unique for a stepmom and stepdaughter relationship.” she said. “First of all, I am 11 years older than her, I didn't raise her and we find tremendous humor in that.”

Hilaria valued Ireland's opinion when she first started dating her father.

“Before I was her stepmother, when I met her I told Alec, ‘If she doesn't like me, I am not staying,'” she revealed. “I [was] not going to be the wicked stepmother. My place in life is not to come into a family and cause problems.”



Hilaria said she had “too much respect for the family” to cause issues, adding, “[Ireland] immediately welcomed me and we have never fought and it is so easy.”

Before finding love with Hilaria, Alec, 66, was married to Kim Basinger from 1993 to 2002. Their divorce was finalized after a bitter custody dispute that later caused tension between Alec and Ireland. They were able to work out their differences and Ireland has since become close to Alec and Hilaria — and the couple's seven kids: Carmen Gabriela, 11, Rafael Thomas, 9, Leonardo Ángel Charles, 8, Romeo Alejandro David, 6, Eduardo “Edu” Pao Lucas, 4, María Lucía Victoria, 4, and Ilaria Catalina Irena, 2.

On Sunday's episode, Hilaria also elaborated on her first meeting with Alec.

“Obviously our age difference is there. I am always insecure. Even when I had dinner with him, I felt like it was a big deal that someone was bringing me out,” she recalled. “I was in the land of splitting the check and it was a big deal that he paid. I didn't take that lightly.”

She continued: “Then he texted me asking, ‘What do you think about dating someone 26 years older than you?' What I appreciated about him was that he was very into consent. He asked to kiss me for the first time.”

According to Alec, Hilaria previously dated men “who were age appropriate” for her. “She was very young so they were very young,” he told the cameras. “I would meet them and be like, ‘I get it. They are very handsome and very super fit.'”

Hilaria valued good appearance in a potential partner because of her plans for children.

“I wanted to have my kids and I wanted them to look good. I wanted to have a baby with a good looking guy. It could have been anybody, you were just the first good looking guy who walked up to me,” she quipped before being asked by producers if she dated other actors. “I wouldn't date an actor when he was an actor. I dated an actor who went on to be on Broadway and we went and saw him naked.”

Alec poked fun at how he attended Broadway's Take Me Out to see “the love” of Hilaria's life, which she denied. The meeting got even more awkward when Alec saw Hilaria's ex naked after the musical.

“He is there and he turns out with his personality hanging out,” Alec revealed. “He had like a clarinet hanging from his pants.”

The Baldwins airs on TLC Sundays at 10 p.m. ET.

As if that kiss between Sam Nivola and Patrick Schwarzenegger on The White Lotus wasn't weird enough, the show pushed the incest subplot further by having the brothers engage in a moment of sexual intimacy.

During the Sunday, March 23, episode of the hit HBO series, Saxon (Schwarzenegger) and Lochlan (Nivola) have different reactions after their night of drugs, alcohol and sex. Saxon slowly started to remember exactly what happened, which is when he realized Lochlan was the one who slept with Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon).

Saxon, meanwhile, was in the same bed and getting pleasured by none other than his own brother. Yep, you read that right. And if you didn't see it the first time,, The White Lotus made sure to flashback three separate times during the episode to the moment when Lochlan was touching Saxon in a sexual manner.

While Saxon just wanted to forget, the situation got worse when Chloe brought it up to Saxon, who pretended he didn't remember even though no one believed him.



Before The White Lotus crossed an incest boundary they can't come back from, Nivola, 21, opened up about the confusing tension between his and Schwarzenegger's characters.

“We didn't really talk about it at all until we shot the scene. My character's big turning point is that moment at the end of episode 5,” Nivola told GQ earlier this month after the brothers initially shared a kiss on screen. “We shot it a few different ways, and we talked about it a lot. I think at the end of the day, it was supposed to just be like they're all really f—ed up, and, of course, kissing your brother is incredibly wrong and weird and gross. But I think as is the case with The White Lotus, it's like these crazy actions and sort of heightened reality coming from really real emotions that are actually really relatable to your everyday guy.”

Nivola called the scene “really complicated” from his character's perspective.

“He just is desperate for his brother's approval, and he's out doing this partying drug thing with Saxon, which is a thing that Saxon keeps talking about, and all he talks about is sex. He's like, ‘Sex is the main point of life. You need to get laid. That's what you need,'” he explained. “I'm like, ‘OK. Well, in this charged sexual environment, what can I do to make you notice me and get you to approve of me?' And then, he does the wrong thing to make that happen.”

Le Bon, 38, meanwhile, recalled Schwarzenegger, 31, needing some encouragement, telling Vulture, “I think for Patrick it was really difficult. For Sam, he was kind of like, ‘It's whatever, let's just do it well one time and it will be over.' Because if you don't do it well the first time, then you have to do it over and over again.”

She continued: “We all thought he was going to throw up. And Sam was like, ‘It's fine, it's just a kiss, calm down!'”

Elsewhere in Sunday's episode, Chloe attempted to hide her threesome from Gary a.k.a Greg (Jon Gries). Her boyfriend didn't seem to mind her potentially sleeping with someone else as he was more focused on a gathering he was planning — that he really wanted Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) to attend — for unclear reasons.

Kate (Leslie Bibb), Laurie (Carrie Coon) and Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan) ended up at odds after their night out with Valentin (Arnas Fedaravicius). Married Jaclyn specifically had a lot to answer for after sleeping with Valentin.

Finally, there was Rick (Walton Goggins) who reunited with Frank (Sam Rockwell) on their quest to maybe or maybe not murder Sritala's (Lek Patravadi) husband and the Ratliff's continued to fall apart with Timothy (Jason Isaacs) once again not telling his family about the fact that they are now all broke.

New episodes of The White Lotus air on HBO Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.

Christine is reportedly now dating Texas Capital Bank energy sales specialist Thomas McGarrity, and the two have been seen on vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico this weekend. 

The two were seen sitting on lounge chairs in a cabana on Friday (March 21), sipping drinks, and even sharing a kiss. See photos on E! News and TMZ!

On her move to Texas, Christine previously told People it's nice to be close to family. 

"I am really, really grateful to be living here," she said. "I have a sister who lives really close to me, and my son has a cousin. So it's really something that I needed as opposed to the chaos when I was in Los Angeles.”

She also notes that her son has been thriving since the move, and has become quite the talker after previously being nonverbal.

"It's just so crazy since I moved to Texas. I mean, he was literally a nonverbal child at three years old, which is pretty rare,” Christine said. “He went from that to being immediately enrolled in school, having other kids around him, being so talkative, being so extroverted.”
