Led by Geoff Kendrick, the StanChart team said bitcoin's correlation with the Nasdaq has ""almost always"" been stronger than with gold, the old-school safe haven asset. While BTC may have a role as a place to hide in instances of financial instability like the 2023 regional banking crisis or what might be the unsustainable U.S. debt trajectory, the report said, the reality is that there's rarely a need for such hedges, thus its increasing behavior as more like a traditional tech stock.

""Investors can view BTC as both a hedge against traditional finance and as part of their tech allocation,"" said Kendrick. But, at least ""in the short term, BTC may be better viewed as a tech stock than as a hedge against TradFi issues,"" he added.

Playing with the idea of bitcoin as part of a tech portfolio, the report proposed a remodel of the index of the so-called Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) stocks — the mega-cap tech names that have driven overall market returns of late, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta and Tesla (TSLA). This new ""Mag 7B"" would swap out Tesla for bitcoin.

The result? The Mag7B produced consistently higher risk-adjusted returns than the original group over the past seven years, reinforcing BTC's role in a tech-focused portfolio, said Kendrick. The Mag7B outperformed the Mag7 on average by around 1% with nearly 2% lower volatility on an annual basis, a key benefit to institutional investors and large asset allocators, he continued.

Mag7B return/volatility vs. Mag7 (Standard Chartered)

""BTC should be seen as serving multiple purposes in investor portfolios. This would open up the possibility of even more institutional buying,"" Kendrick noted.

Asset managers have been advocating for including bitcoin in investment portfolios for diversification purposes. For example, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, recommended considering an up to 2% BTC allocation in traditional stock and bond portfolios. Meanwhile, asset managers like 21Shares and Bitwise have launched exchange-traded funds (ETFs) combining gold and bitcoin as complementary assets.",coindesk

A risk-off mood persists, but is weakened amid reports suggesting that the U.S. tariffs due April 2 might be more measured than initially expected.

“Investors are remaining cautious on the upcoming price moment due to the uncertainty,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, said in a Telegram message. “This week's U.S. economic reports on consumer confidence, personal spending, and PCE may show whether American consumers can cope with these economic changes or are preparing for less spending and more budgeting.”

Consumer confidence measures how optimistic Americans are about the economy — high confidence means more spending, low means more saving. Personal spending tracks how much people buy, which is a big driver of economic growth. PCE, or Personal Consumption Expenditures, is a key inflation gauge, showing price changes in goods and services.

These reports can affect crypto markets. Strong consumer confidence and spending suggest a healthy economy, which might boost crypto prices as people invest more in riskier assets. High PCE (rising inflation) could worry investors, pushing them toward crypto as a hedge against a weaker dollar. But if confidence drops and spending slows, it might signal a downturn, making investors cautious and dragging crypto prices down.

Some traders, however, say the U.S. economy is stronger than thought, making current price levels a good area to buy for those bullish in the medium to long term.

“U.S. 'hard' economic data remains robust and in contrast with the soft sentiment, suggesting an over-extrapolation of the current weakness versus underlying fundamentals,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in an email. “Macro observers have generally been more precarious in their assessments than the actual reality, and we believe that the underlying economy remains stronger han feared.

“Crypto markets had a similar quiet week, with prices largely rangebound and rebounding off recent lows as a mirror move of the equity action. Technically speaking, prices remain on a negative downward trend but are stabilizing around key support levels, with ETH settling at the highs of the 2022 range and the next big support level at around the 1500 area,” Fan said.

Ether’s outlook comes as the blockchain saw one of its lowest 24-hour revenues in recent months, sending daily burns to a record low.

A burn permanently removes a token from circulation by sending it to an address not controlled by anyone. Ether burns started in August 2021, when Ethereum’s EIP-1559 upgrade occurred, stemming from the network burning all base fees charged to users per transaction.

Transactional activity has declined over the past few months amid a rising preference for cheaper networks such as Solana and Tron and a general taper-off of speculative trading activity since late January.

Just 50 ETH was burned on Sunday, data shows, a record low and a nearly 99% drop from the record 71,000 ETH on May 1, 2022. Daily burns have been gradually declining since early 2023, ranging between 500 ETH to more than 3,000 ETH.",coindesk

Market data shows that in the minutes after Trump made the post, his eponymous cryptocurrency went from around $10.93 to approximately $12.25, for a 12% rise. After a brief sell-off, the $TRUMP token is trading at $11.91, or, up around 9%.

It's been a wild ride for the TRUMP token since its debut in January, soaring briefly to billions in market cap amid endorsements by President Trump himself before crashing 75% amidst broader market turmoil, and drawing political backlash from House Democrats aiming to curb officials' involvement in such meme coins through proposed legislation.

House Democrats, led by Rep. Sam Liccardo, have introduced the MEME Act, CoinDesk previously reported, which aims to prohibit federal officials and their families from profiting off meme coins.

In a blog post, Rep. Liccardo specifically called out the $TRUMP token, accusing the First Family of exploiting the public through meme coins, warning of insider trading and foreign influence via the token, and emphasized the prohibition from the MEME Act would extend broadly to other financial assets including securities like Truth Social stock.

The news came days after the Federal Reserve retained forecasts for two interest-rate cuts while downplaying fears of a prolonged inflationary impact from the tariffs.

“Bitcoin is attempting to form a bottom, supported by Trump’s recent shift toward ‘flexibility’ on the upcoming April 2 reciprocal tariffs, softening his earlier rhetoric,” Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients.

Thielen noted the Fed's recent tone suggested that it will “look past short-term inflationary pressures, laying the groundwork for potential future easing.”

As BTC rose over 1% since midnight UTC to $87,300, AI coins, meme cryptocurrencies and layer-1 tokens posted bigger gains. Ether rose 4% to $2,090 with its supply held on centralized exchanges sliding to the lowest since November 2015.

Token Talk

By Shaurya Malwa

The newly issued ROUTINE token has become one of the biggest winners for microcap memecoin trades in recent weeks, flying from zero market cap to more than $17 million over the weekend.

The token is a nod to a morning routine tutorial posted by fitness coach Ashton Hall, which bagged over 500 million views across X, Instagram and other social networks.

The video went viral for showing Hall's 4 a.m. start that includes wiping his face with a banana peel and constantly dipping it in a bowl of sparkling spring water from Saratoga.



The morning routine pic.twitter.com/HLhpwpKib8 — Tips For Men - Fashion | Essentials | Luxury (@tipsformenx) March 20, 2025

Aspects of the video birthed their own memecoins, themed after bottled water, sparkling water and even bananas.

None, however, reached the apparent appeal of ROUTINE — which has captured $34 million in trading volumes over the past 24 hours and holds just over $600,000 in liquidity as of Asian afternoon hours Monday.

The ROUTINE memecoin phenomenon is a textbook example of how internet culture and speculative trading intersect in the crypto space. Hall, known as ASH Fitness, has over 8.7 million Instagram followers, amplifying the video’s reach and contributing to ROUTINE’s rapid adoption among retail traders and the hope for gains in a little-changed crypto market.

The crossover between crypto and insurance usually involves shoehorning existing risk categories for loss and theft into covering hot and cold versions of digital assets custody. Tabit’s approach is interesting because it explores ways firms and individuals can capitalize on their bitcoin holdings without getting involved in trading or incurring significant counterparty risk.

Tabit co-founder and CEO Stephen Stonberg said bitcoin holders are invited to contribute assets to the firm’s system of segregated reserve cells, which is managed using non-custodial tech from Fireblocks, to earn yields of around 10%. A good analogy from the world of insurance is the way accredited investors, known as “Names,” deploy assets into insurance syndicates at the Lloyd’s of London insurance market.

“For a technology like crypto, you may need a new underwriter, but the way the insurance is done is fundamentally the same as before,” Stonberg said in an interview. “We are holding our regulatory capital in bitcoin, and I think bringing in a new capital source to the insurance industry and innovating with the balance sheet is an opportunity that other people weren't really looking at.”

Since 1946, the question of whether a product is a “security” or “commodity” has been governed by the Supreme Court’s decision in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. Courts have struggled to uniformly apply the “Howey” test to digital assets, which should not be surprising because it’s a decades-old decision about citrus groves.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Node Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

Digital assets do not cleanly fit into either the “security” or “commodity” bucket. They are something entirely new. But the distinction between securities and commodities matters under the law because the SEC regulates securities and the CFTC regulates products that include commodities.

Congress is considering new legislation that resembles last year’s FIT21 bill. That legislation will move past the outmoded Howey test and sharply define how particular digital assets are classified.

Friday’s roundtable, which included a dozen or so prominent crypto lawyers alongside members of the SEC’s crypto taskforce, should have served as a jumping off point for ideas and proposals that the SEC could use as input to legislators considering the new legislative framework for crypto. But, instead, much of the discussion focused on years-old debates about the four-party Howey Test, and philosophical discussions about the nature of securities.

To be sure, some participants in the roundtable – like a16z General Counsel Miles Jennings – made important proposals, such as Jennings’ call to focus on the economic reality rather than the legal relationship between the issuer and the investor. But much of the panel’s time was spent debating everything from Bitcoin’s use in ransomware attacks to the SEC’s recent staff guidance regarding meme coins.Given the SEC and CFTC will likely share regulatory authority over digital assets in any new legislation, the line between the two regulators is very important to the crypto industry. The goal should be the creation of clear rules that issuers can follow to ensure compliance regardless of whether their token is deemed to be a “security” or a “commodity.”

While I applaud Commissioner Hester Peirce’s creation of the roundtable, along with her characteristic openness and transparency, Friday’s roundtable was a missed opportunity. She should have invited CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline Pham and her team to participate, or at least to attend. The CFTC was not mentioned once during the roundtable, and the crypto industry needs the SEC and CFTC to work together seamlessly in the years to come.

Congress is moving forward with its own answer to the question of when digital assets are securities, whether or not the SEC decides to provide Congress with any input. For the sake of the crypto industry, I hope that Commissioner Peirce’s next roundtable is focused on fostering ideas that will inform the legislation that will shape the industry for years to come.

The next major resistance level is at $93,245, which corresponds to the short-term holder realized price — i.e., the average on-chain acquisition cost of coins held outside exchange reserves and moved within the last 155 days. These coins are considered the most likely to be spent at any given time.

The redemptions represent nearly 6% of the total $6.77 billion in assets held by spot ether ETFs, according to data from SoSoValue. Just one day this month—March 4—saw positive inflows, with $14.58 million added. In comparison, January and February saw inflows of $101 million and $60 million, respectively.

Spot bitcoin ETFs also faced withdrawals, with $893 million in net outflows this month, but the scale relative to assets under management, roughly 0.9% of $94.35 billion, was far less severe. Bitcoin funds remain net positive for the year after strong inflows of $5.25 billion in January.

The contrast mirrors recent market performance. Since March 1, ether has dropped roughly 8.5%, while bitcoin has gained more than 3%. Year-to-date, ether has plunged over 37% to around $2,080. Bitcoin, while also down, has fared better with a 7.5% decline to about $87,300. The broader CoinDesk 20 Index fell 21% in the same period.

Despite the downturn, ether ETFs still hold a net inflow of $2.42 billion since their launch. But that’s dwarfed by the $36.05 billion pulled in by the bitcoin counterparts, highlighting the gap in investor appetite between the two assets.",coindesk

On Friday, the Treasury Department's sanctions watchdog removed Tornado Cash from its global blacklist while also removing over 100 ether (ETH) addresses from the Specially Designated Nationals list. The platform was backlisted in 2022 for its alleged role in laundering $445 million stolen by the North Korea-linked Lazarus cybercrime group.

The Treasury then argued that the action of delisting Tornado Cash resolved the issue at hand and that a final court ruling ordering it to remove the crypto mixer from its sanctions list was no longer necessary, according to a court filing dated March 21.

Grewal, however, said the Treasury's attempts to have the case declared moot is an attempt to sidestep a ruling from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that will leave the door open for a renewed blacklisting and sanctions.

""After grudgingly delisting TC, they now claim they've mooted any need for a final court judgment. But that's not the law, and they know it,"" Grewal said on X. ""Under the voluntary cessation exception, a defendant's decision to end a challenged practice moots a case only if the defendant can show that the practice cannot 'reasonably be expected to recur.'""

Coinbase funded the court case that made its way to the appeals court, Van Loon vs. Treasury.

Grewal cited the example of the FBI v. Fikre case, in which the government removed Yonas Fikre, a U.S. citizen and Sudanese emigree, from the No Fly List, and argued in court that this action rendered Fikre's lawsuit moot. Fikre had brought a lawsuit alleging that the government unlawfully placed him on the No Fly List.

But, the Ninth Circuit reversed that decision saying that the party seeking to moot a case based on its own voluntary cessation of challenged conduct must show that the conduct cannot “reasonably be expected to recur.”

In Tornado Cash's case, the Treasury hasn't provided any assurance that it won't re-sanction the crypto mixer.

""Here, Treasury has likewise removed the Tornado Cash entities from the SDN, but has provided no assurance that it will not re-list Tornado Cash again. That's not good enough, and will make this clear to the district court,"" Grewal noted.",coindesk

Led by Geoff Kendrick, Stanchart's team said that Bitcoin's correlation with Nasdaq has been ""almost always"" stronger than with gold, the traditional refuge. While BTC can play a role as a refuge in cases of financial instability, such as the regional banking crisis of 2023 or the possible unsustainable trajectory of US debt, according to the report, the reality is that such coverage is rarely needed, so that their behavior is increasingly resembles that of a traditional technological action.

""Investors can consider BTC as coverage against traditional finances and as part of their technological assignment,"" Kendrick said. But, at least ""in the short term, BTC could be considered better as a technological action than as a coverage against traditional finance problems,"" he added.

Playing with the idea of ​​Bitcoin as part of a technological portfolio, the report proposed a remodeling of the index of the Magnificent 7 calls (MAG 7): The technology companies of great capitalization that have promoted the general profitability of the market in recent times: Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta and Tesla (TSLA). This new ""Mag 7B"" would replace Tesla with Bitcoin.

The result? MAG7B generated risk -adjusted profitability consistently higher than the original group during the last seven years, which reinforces the role of BTC in a technology -centered portfolio, Kendrick said. The MAG7B exceeded MAG7 in an average of around 1%, with an annual volatility almost 2% lower, a key advantage for institutional investors and large assets of assets, he continued.

""BTC should be considered as a cryptocurrency with multiple functions in investor portfolios. This would open the possibility of a greater number of institutional purchases,"" Kendrick said.

Asset managers have advocated Bitcoin's inclusion in investment portfolios for diversification purposes. For example, Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, is recommended to be considered an allocation of up to 2% BTC in traditional shares of shares and Bond.

The risk aversion climate persists, but has weakened in a means of reports that suggests that US tariffs that will enter into force on April 2 could be more moderate than expected initially.

""Investors remain cautious about the next moment of prices due to uncertainty,"" said Nick Ruck, director of LVRG Research, in a Telegram message. ""This week's American economic reports on consumer confidence, personal spending and PCE could show if US consumers can face these economic changes or if they are preparing for lower expense and greater budgetary control.""

Consumer confidence measures the optimism of Americans with respect to the economy: a high level of trust means greater expense, while a low level means greater savings. Personal expense measures how much people buy, which is an important driver of economic growth. The PCE, or personal consumption expense, is a key indicator of inflation that shows price variations in goods and services.

These reports can affect crypto markets. Solid confidence and consumer spending suggest a healthy economy, which could boost cryptocurrency prices as people invest more in higher risk assets. A high PCE (growing inflation) could worry investors, promoting them to crypto as coverage against a weaker dollar. However, if trust decreases and spending is slowed, it could indicate a recession, generating caution in investors and dragging cryptocurrency prices down.

However, some merchants say that the US economy is stronger than you think, which makes current price levels a good purchase zone for those optimists in the medium and long term.

""The"" hard 'economic data of the USA. ""Macroeconomic analysts, in general, have been more cautious in their evaluations than in reality, and we believe that the underlying economy remains stronger than was feared.""

The crypto markets had a similarly quiet week, with prices that were maintained in a wide range and bouncing from recent minimums, reflecting the behavior of the actions. Technically, prices maintain a negative bearish trend, but are stabilized around key support levels, with ETH establishing themselves at the maximum of the 2022 range and the next important level of support around 1500 points, Fan said.

Ether's perspective arises at a time when the block chain registered one of its lower 24 -hour income in recent months, which sent daily burning to a historical minimum.

A burning permanently eliminates a circulation token by sending it to an address that nobody controls. Ether's burnings began in August 2021, when the EIP-1559 Ethereum update was implemented, because the network burned all base commissions charged to users by transaction.

Transactional activity has decreased in recent months in the midst of a growing preference for cheaper networks like Solana and Tron and a general decrease in speculative commercial activity since the end of January.

Only 50 ETH were burned on Sunday, the data shows, a historical minimum and a drop of almost 99% from the 71,000 ETH record of May 1, 2022. Daily burns have been gradually decreasing since the beginning of 2023, oscillating between 500 ETH and more than 3,000 eth.",coindesk

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,Democrats Propose More Bad Bitcoin And Crypto Regulation,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/democrats-propose-more-bad-bitcoin-and-crypto-regulation,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 13:32:06 GMT","On Friday, Maryland Delegate Adrian Boafo (D) and New York Assemblyman Clyde Vanel (D) sent a joint letter to Democratic Congressional leaders urging them to pass comprehensive crypto legislation at the federal level.

In the letter, the elected officials cited New York State as being a leader in crypto regulation and proposed that New York’s BitLicense be used as a model for what federal crypto regulation should look like. The letter’s authors also noted that New York State has placed a two-year moratorium on proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining that uses fossil fuels (seemingly citing this as something else the federal government might consider doing).

It was upon reading these points in the letter that I realized that Democrats are capable of putting forward Bitcoin and crypto policy ideas stupider than what former Vice President Harris proposed in October 2024, which was “a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and other digital assets [that protects] Black men who invest in and own these assets.”

(Please note that I’m in favor of a regulatory framework that protects the right of Black men to invest in crypto assets. I’m also in favor of one that protects the right of Asian men, Hispanic men, White men, and Indigenous men to do the same. Oh, and I’d like for whatever Bitcoin and crypto policy we craft here in the U.S. to protect the right of women and transgender people of all races to invest in bitcoin and crypto, as well.)

With that said, let me break down why the U.S. federal government’s creating something comparable to New York’s BitLicense and putting a mining moratorium on Bitcoin miners that use any amount of fossil fuels would be a bad idea.

And please forgive me in advance for being emotional at points. This issue is personal to me, as I’m a resident of New York State and have experienced firsthand the damage that politicians and bureaucrats have done to the Bitcoin and crypto industry in the state.

The BitLicense

New York State requires that all virtual currency businesses that operate in the state obtain a BitLicense.

At face value, obtaining a license to operate a business seems harmless enough. But once you learn that it takes months to years to complete all of the paperwork and to jump through all of the hoops required to obtain one and that it costs upward of $100,000 to go through this process, you quickly see why so many established companies in the space — never mind the early-stage start-ups — don’t even start the process.

Because of the BitLicense, New York State residents cannot use reputable platforms like Strike, River, Swan, and Kraken. Nor can they use Lightning on CashApp or the fiat-to-bitcoin exchange on Fold. This is only to name a few of the Bitcoin/crypto products and services that we can’t use because of red tape.

But what’s perhaps more of a slap in the face is that when you attempt to use some of these platforms as a New York State resident, you’re presented with messages such as “This exchange doesn’t serve residents of jurisdictions including New York State, Iran, Syria and North Korea.”

TRULY FUCKING STAGGERING THE COMPANY THAT NEW YORK POLITICIANS AND BUREAUCRATS HAVE PUT NEW YORK RESIDENTS IN.

If we were to apply the BitLicense on a federal level, we would deeply stifle innovation and entrepreneurship, as not only would we greatly hinder the Bitcoin and crypto companies that have the money and resources to go through the process of obtaining a federal BitLicense, but we’d create a moat around them while creating a scenario in which the start-ups that can’t afford to go through the process either close up shop or simply not serve U.S. citizens.

A federal BitLicense would be a major hindrance to President Trump’s accomplishing his goal of making the United States the Bitcoin superpower and the crypto capital of the world. (Maybe that’s why these Democrats proposed it?)

The Mining Moratorium

While I know that burning fossil fuels is detrimental to the environment and I believe that human-made climate change is a real thing, I’m also a proponent of people being gainfully employed and industries being able to flourish.

And in upstate New York, there’s been a notable lack of both since factories began closing down in the region after World War II.

What’s replaced gainful employment in factories in many parts of upstate New York are service-sector jobs that barely enable workers to make ends meet.

The urban blight in most cities in upstate New York is so palpable that it’s nauseating.

What we could do to revive upstate New York is invite the Bitcoin mining industry in. Sure, Bitcoin mining companies might burn some fossil fuels to power their operations at first, but as Bitcoin mining incentivizes renewable energy production, they could move away from fossil fuels as their source of energy.

Also, if the likes of Assemblyman Vanel and New York State’s governor, Kathy Hochul (D), are so against companies that burn fossil fuels then 1) Why haven’t they put a moratorium on all companies in the state that use fossil fuels? and 2) Why haven’t they enacted laws that do things like stopping all New York residents from using cars that have internal combustion engines?

I ask these questions rhetorically, as I know I’d never get answers from either of them on this, because the mining moratorium is more for show — virtue signaling, if you will — than anything.

If they really wanted to make a concerted effort to stop the environmental damage that burning fossil fuels causes in New York, they’d do much more than prohibit Bitcoin mining companies that use fossil fuels from operating in the state (and they’d take down the economy of New York in the process).

If we were to apply such a mining moratorium on a federal level, we’d not only put many Americans out of work, but we’d also cede much of the hashrate to hostile foreign powers who are using fossil fuels to mine bitcoin anyway.

My Plea To Democrats

Please stop proposing regulation that will hurt an industry that could otherwise provide many Americans with high-quality jobs.

Please stop listening to the likes of Delegate Boafo, Assemblyman Vanel, or any of the backward-thinking Democrats to which this letter was addressed, including Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

Instead, start taking queues from more forward-thinking Democrats like Congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA), Congressman Ritchie Torres (D-NY), and former Congressman Wiley Nickel (D-NC), politicians who would like to see Bitcoin and the industry that surrounds it succeed in the United States.",bitcoinmagazine

Unlike traditional crypto loan services that take custody of users’ assets (and sometimes engage in risky practices like rehypothecation), Lava is self-custodial and leverages native bitcoin smart contracts (DLCs) to enable a more secure borrowing experience. The platform’s primary product is the Lava Vault, available on mobile and desktop, which serves as a secure, self-custodial wallet and borrowing interface. It uses advanced security features, such as device-based secure chips for private key management and biometric/two-factor authentication, to ensure user funds remain safe. Lava also offers encrypted backups to mitigate the risk of fund loss from a single point of failure.

Lava’s Loans product also enables users to borrow dollars against their Bitcoin holdings, providing liquidity without requiring them to sell their Bitcoin. This is particularly appealing to Bitcoin HODLers who want to maintain long-term exposure to BTC’s potential appreciation while accessing cash for immediate needs. Lava’s unique Discreet Log Contract (DLC) technology enables it to provide these loans on a self-custody basis, reducing counterparty and rehypothecation risk.

Stablecoin Integration – LavaUSD

Lava has launched its own stablecoin offering – LavaUSD – to combine Bitcoin with dollar-based spending. LavaUSD is redeemable 1:1 for the US dollar via reserves invested in cash and highly liquid instruments. The reserve portfolio contains a mix of short-dated US Treasuries, overnight US Treasury repurchase agreements, and money market funds all custodied with partners such as BlackRock and Fidelity. LavaUSD enables users to make payments anywhere in the world frictionlessly.

Here’s why they launched it:

Instant and Global : LavaUSD extends the stability of the US dollar to a global user base while maintaining the trustlessness and security of modern cryptography. All transactions are instantaneous and settle 24/7/365, with support for instant on and off-ramps to fiat currencies around the world.

This ensures that the reserves are fully protected and kept separate from the operating funds of Lava the company, the issuer, or its custodians. Even in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, these reserves remain accessible and are safeguarded to ensure full backing of all issued stablecoins. Cross-Chain Swaps: The platform supports stablecoins on other networks (not just Bitcoin), using atomic swaps to ensure borrowers receive stablecoins while lenders secure Bitcoin collateral. Over time, Lava plans to expand support for multiple networks, potentially including Bitcoin-based stablecoin alternatives as they mature.

The team has attracted significant investment. Since inception Lava has raised $30 million from investors including Khosla Ventures, Founders Fund, and Susquehanna International Group with angel participation from institutions including the Qatar Investment Authority, Google, and Franklin Templeton among others.. In December 2024, it raised $10 million in a Series A round co-led by Khosla Ventures and Founders Fund, with notable investors like Keith Rabois and Peter Thiel involved. More recently, Lava raised a Series A for an additional $30 million financing round with investors like Qatar Investment Authority and Bijan Tehrani.

The Case for Spending BTC vs. Spending Dollars

Last week, this tweet by Caitlin Long and amplified by our favorite Bitcoiner in Congress Cynthia Lummis received significant pushback from some bitcoiners, offended at the idea of perpetuating the fiat system instead of transaction directly with Bitcoin, as it was intended by Satoshi.

(Special S/O to our Bitcoin Magazine OG Mike Germano and PubKey extraordinaire Thomas Pacchia for so graciously holding beers – wine is better!)

Spending BTC directly with merchants or individuals is often hailed as a step toward Hyperbitcoinization—the hypothetical scenario where BTC becomes the dominant global currency. This approach strengthens Bitcoin’s network effect, encourages adoption, and aligns with its peer-to-peer philosophy, bypassing intermediaries like banks. However, this strategy faces significant hurdles. Firstly, BTC’s price appreciation potential remains substantial. Historical data shows BTC’s value has surged from negligible levels in 2009 to over $100,000 by early 2025, driven by finite supply (capped at 21 million coins) and growing institutional interest (e.g., MicroStrategy’s treasury strategy). Spending BTC now risks forgoing future gains, especially as halvings and market dynamics continue to constrain supply against rising demand.

Secondly, tax conditions in many jurisdictions, including the United States, impose restrictive burdens on spending BTC. In the U.S., the IRS treats BTC as property, meaning each transaction triggers a taxable event. Selling or spending BTC at a profit incurs capital gains tax—up to 37% for short-term gains or 20% for long-term holdings—based on the difference between purchase price and sale value. This complexity discourages direct spending, as users must track cost basis, report gains, and navigate administrative overhead, often outweighing the convenience of BTC payments. For instance, a $1,000 BTC purchase spent at $10,000 would trigger a $2,800 tax liability (assuming a 28% effective rate), making dollar-based spending via stablecoins a more tax-efficient alternative.

Why Holding BTC Outweighs Spending Now

Given BTC’s upward trajectory, spending it now may undermine long-term wealth preservation. Analysts suggest BTC could reach $200,000 or more by 2030 if current trends persist, driven by inflation hedging and a weakening fiat system. Spending BTC at current prices locks in value at a fraction of its potential, especially when alternatives like Lava’s lending model provide liquidity without forfeiture. Moreover, the tax burden amplifies this disincentive, as frequent transactions erode net returns. This aligns with the “HODL” philosophy, where retaining BTC maximizes appreciation while using borrowed dollars or stablecoins meets immediate needs.

Mitigation Strategy: Buy-Back Mechanism

To balance the desire to spend with BTC retention, a buy-back strategy offers a pragmatic solution. After borrowing dollars against BTC via Lava’s platform, users can spend these funds while committing to repurchase BTC at a later date when market conditions or personal finances allow. This approach leverages Lava’s self-custodial lending (with its 7.5% interest cost) to access liquidity without selling, preserving the original BTC stash. The buy-back can be timed to capitalize on market dips or post-tax season liquidity, potentially at lower prices, enhancing overall holdings. For example, borrowing $10,000 against 0.1 BTC (valued at $100,000) allows spending, with a buy-back of 0.09 BTC at $90,000 later, netting a gain if BTC appreciates further. This strategy mitigates tax exposure by deferring sales and aligns with long-term appreciation goals.

As Hyperbitcoinization looms on the horizon, the tension between saving in Bitcoin and spending in dollars reflects a pivotal moment for BTC’s evolution. Holding BTC maximizes its scarcity-driven potential—fueled by finite supply and growing adoption—while tax complexities and volatility discourage direct spending. Stablecoins and lending models offer a practical workaround, preserving Bitcoin’s long-term value while meeting immediate needs. Until BTC fully transcends fiat, this duality—hoarding a revolutionary asset while leaning on traditional currency—may define the path to a Bitcoin-dominated future, and this future is being build by Bitcoin companies!

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,Tabit Insurance Raises $40 Million Bitcoin-Funded Insurance Facility,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/tabit-insurance-raises-40-million-bitcoin-funded-insurance-facility,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 11:09:31 GMT","Tabit Insurance SCC has announced the capitalization of a $40 million insurance facility, funded entirely in Bitcoin, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. This marks the first time a property and casualty (P&C) insurer has held all of its regulatory reserves in BTC while continuing to denominate its insurance policies and premiums in U.S. dollars. The company expressed the benefits of its funding approach, allowing regulators and auditors to verify reserves in real time.

According to Tabit, its use of BTC as capital is intended to provide an alternative source of capacity for the insurance industry. The company operates as a segregated cell company, which allows for additional cells to be formed to deploy capital in the insurance sector. This structure also enables BTC holders to earn USD returns through their own segregated cells.

William Shihara, co-founder of Tabit, stated, “Our approach to capital allocation underscores our confidence in providing a steady hand to our partners. By combining traditional balance sheet strength with carefully chosen assets like bitcoin, we’re able to stay responsive to market shifts and better serve the insurance community. This solution offers a regulated dollar return which we’re excited to earn on an alternative asset class such as bitcoin.”

The company also emphasized that its reserves are verifiable on the blockchain through a proof-of-reserves model, which allows for real-time transparency beyond the typical quarterly disclosures in the insurance industry.

“At Tabit, we saw a clear opportunity to enhance transparency within an industry that has been sorely lacking in innovation,” said Stephen Stonberg, co-founder and CEO. “We’re eager to move the insurance sector into the future by demonstrating what is possible by allowing an insurer to access a largely new and untapped source of insurance capital: digital assets.”

Tabit is headquartered in Bridgetown, Barbados, a jurisdiction known for its captive insurance market and is a top ten global captive jurisdiction. The company states that Barbados’ regulatory framework provides oversight for its operations.

Tabit plans to work with insurance carriers, brokers, and organizations seeking additional capacity or alternative risk financing options. It also aims to collaborate with large holders of digital assets who want to generate USD income while maintaining BTC exposure.

Strategy has been aggressively accumulating bitcoin since 2020 under the direction of CEO Michael Saylor. The company views bitcoin as a long-term store of value to hedge against inflation and global uncertainty.

Funds for this latest bitcoin purchase came from Strategy’s sale of 1.975 million shares of common stock, raising approximately $592 million and the STRK ATM.

With its laser focus on bitcoin, Strategy has become a leading corporate example of allocating treasury reserves to vitcoin. Other public companies, like Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, have followed a similar game plan on a smaller scale.

By staking its future on bitcoin’s network effects and adoption as ‘digital gold’, Strategy aims to maximize long-term shareholder value. The company’s stock price has skyrocketed since its first BTC purchase.

With bitcoin gaining credibility among institutions, companies, and even nations, Strategy remains confident in its bitcoin-centric strategy. This latest acquisition shows the company putting its money where its mouth is during the asset’s ongoing maturation.",bitcoinmagazine

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a project backed by President Trump and his children, has tried a new stablecoin called USD1 in the BNB Chain, according to data in chain tracked by Lookochain.

It has been reported that Wintermute's public portfolio was involved. The portfolio has made several test transfers with the USD1 stablecoin, including Cross-Chain technology tests between the Ethereum and BNB Chain networks, according to an analysis of the Crypto Invest Y merchant.

Decrypt reported last October that WLFI was in the process of developing a native stable. According to the sources, the project team was prioritizing the security and reliability guarantee before launching the market.

WLFI's co -founder hints upcoming product releases

The implementation of the stablecoin remains at the end of $ 550 million in tokens sales earlier this month. In a statement after this success, Zak Folkman, co -founder of the project, said that these sales were only the initial steps.

Folkman recently shared a conversation with Sergey Nazarov, co -founder of Chainlink, which will be some ""really big ads"" in the coming weeks.

The project has formed alliances with blockchain protocols, including Chainlink and AAVE, to improve their defi offers and use decentralized oracle services.

«In terms of what we are building, I would say that we have three main products that we are building and developing. Two of which are already ready and prepared to launch, ”said Folkman.

While Folkman remained reserved on the first, he revealed that the other two were a loan and loan market driven by intelligent contracts and a protocol focused on real world assets (RWA).

""We are working on preparation to advance throughout our product route map and display it in a significant way and that makes sense,"" he explained.

Unlike traditional defi loan platforms, which depend on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), World Liberty Financial will manage its loan market through its own governance process. This allows the company to maintain control and adapt the platform to meet the specific needs of its users, in particular the tradfi institutions.

""When you look at traditional financial institutions, there are many of these tradfi institutions that, at present, have a series of tokenized assets,"" explained Folkman. ""But the problem is that they do not really have a case of use of how they can use, deploy them, market them, etc.""

World Liberty Financial intends to address this challenge by providing a platform that integrates the tradfi assets into the defi ecosystem without problems. This includes offering access to products such as monetary market accounts, commercial real estate, debt and values, which are currently not available in the Defi space.

The company is actively committed to Tradfi institutions, many of which are already exploring or developing tokenized assets. However, these institutions require a regulated and KYC compliant to facilitate their entry into defi.

""They need to be able to interact with a real business that KYC can do, know who the principles are and, you know, put together a commercial agreement, said Folkman.

Folkman added that, as an American corporation with completely Kyc’d principles, World Liberty Financial is well positioned to serve as this bridge.

""It's funny to think about the idea of ​​a great tradfi institution going to a governance forum and publishing a proposal, said Folkman, highlighting the impracticability of traditional defi governance for these institutions.

The company's strategy implies a display in phases, starting with the loan protocol, followed by the RWA protocol. These two protocols are expected to converge, enabling the creation of loan markets for assets supported by RWA.",cryptobriefing

Cryptocurrency investment products recorded $644 million in inflows last week, a reversal after five consecutive weeks of shedding assets.

Inflows to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds largely led the shift, followed by flows to Solana, Polygon and Chainlink investment products, CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill said Monday in a report. Meanwhile, total assets under management for crypto investment products rose 6.3% from their low point on March 10, according to CoinShares’ data.

“Every day last week recorded inflows… signaling a decisive shift in sentiment toward the asset class,” Butterfill said in the report.

Cryptocurrency funds have recorded massive outflows over the past few weeks as geopolitical and economic uncertainties drive investors away from risk-on assets. In the U.S., spot Bitcoin ETFs logged outflows totaling $5.4 billion over a period of five weeks ending on March 21—the longest streak of weekly outflows for the funds since they clinched approval to launch in January 2024.

However, investor sentiment rose last week as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell soothed jittery markets after the U.S. central bank kept interest rates unchanged. Investors' cautious optimism has fueled inflows to digital assets investment products.

Bitcoin ETFs attracted $724 million last week, largely driving the recovery, according to CoinShares' report. Solana-based investment products brought in $6.4 million in inflows, while Polygon and Chainlink recorded marginal inflows of $400,000 and $200,000, respectively, the data shows.

Conversely, Ethereum saw the heaviest loss in investments last week, logging $86 million in outflows. Altcoins such as Sui Polkadot, Tron and Algorand also saw exits of funds during the same period.

The majority of flows came from the U.S., where $632 million flowed into digital asset investment vehicles. Investors in Switzerland, Germany and Hong Kong also poured funds into cryptocurrencies, adding $15.9 million, $13.9 million and $1. 2 million to the products, respectively.

A new Dogecoin (DOGE) reserve set aside 10 million DOGE, around $1.83 million, to help cement the leading meme coin as a legitimate means of payment for businesses and consumers worldwide.

Led by House of Doge, a new entity formed to bolster Dogecoin adoption via corporate deals and collaborations, the newly formed DOGE reserve will differ from other financial reserves–like the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Instead of holding the token as a hedge against economic uncertainty, the DOGE reserve will act as a liquidity pool to help facilitate transactions for global merchants.

“With a strategic reserve, House of Doge is laying the foundation for a payments ecosystem that ensures liquidity, stability, and reliability,” said Michael Galloro, member of the board-elect of House of Doge in a statement. “By maintaining a reserve, we can bridge the gap between transaction processing times and real-world usability, making Dogecoin extremely practical for everyday purchases.”

The proof-of-concept aims to combat blockchain transaction times, which the House of Doge claims has “hindered digital assets from being commonplace in everyday payment.”

In its efforts to make Dogecoin the people’s currency, the entity aims to install reward programs and merchant incentives for utilizing DOGE in payments. It is expected to make its first strategic partnership announcement in the coming months.

Decrypt reached out to House of Doge for comment.

Financial firms like Grayscale and Bitwise have helped level up Dogecoin’s financial legitimacy in recent months by filing for ETFs for crypto’s top meme coin.

The token’s iconic shiba inu logo will soon grace the helmet and IndyCar of driver Devlin DeFrancesco when he takes the track at the Indianapolis 500 in May.

DOGE is up 7% in the last 24 hours to $0.183, but is still down around 25% on the month amid a broader market decline.

A Solana token launched on Pump.fun as a riff on an intense, ice water facial morning routine has revived the meme coin trenches.

Over the weekend, Pump.fun created meme coin Morning Routine (ROUTINE) soared to a $19 million market cap leading many to believe the trenches are heating back up. This meme spawned off the back of a mega viral video of an influencer documenting an intense morning routine, which includes two ice water facials.

The video is believed by many to be the most viewed post on X (formerly Twitter) since the viewership metric became public in 2022, raking in over 667 million views in just four days. Previously, a post by activist Greta Thunberg insulting influencer Andrew Tate was believed to be one of the top liked posts and most viewed with 323 million views and Elon Musk’s post of President Trump following the first assassination attempt drew in 244 million views.

The morning routine pic.twitter.com/HLhpwpKib8 — Tips For Men - Fashion | Essentials | Luxury (@tipsformenx) March 20, 2025

Fitness influencer Ashton Hall first posted the video on TikTok in early February. But it only really took off once it was reuploaded to X by user TipsForMen.

In the video, Hall wakes up at 3:52, instantly cracks open a bottle of Saratoga Spring Water before writing in his diary, and watching videos about God. He then dunks his head in a bowl of ice water, goes to the gym, wipes a banana peel over his face, dunks his head in a bowl of ice water (again), then works remotely while wearing a suit.

Viewers have said they find the video hilarious because of the ice water facials and how seemingly serious Hall takes the whole process.

Morning Routine (ROUTINE) launched on Pump.fun on Friday, March 21, and soared to a $19 million market cap by Sunday. Since then, according to DEX Screener, it retraced 57% to an $8 million market cap before surging 87.8% to a $15 million market cap.

There’s also been a beta play on ROUTINE with Saratoga Spring Water (SARAGOTA). It’s a reference to the bottled water Hall drinks throughout the viral video. SARATOGA had climbed to a $3 million market cap by Monday morning.

The flurry of action on ROUTINE and SARATOGA has breathed life into the meme coin trenches, which have seen months of negative price action. Part of this theory is that traders making profits on ROUTINE will rotate their funds into other coins; as such, it’s worth noting that more than 100 traders have profited more than $10,000 on the fitness-inspired coin, according to DEX Screener.

This also comes as meme coins have started to turn a corner as a sector.

Over the past week, according to CoinGecko, major tokens like Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), SPX6900 (SPX), and Bonk (BONK) have recovered 80%, 68%, and 23% respectively. Alongside this, the entire category, according to CoinGecko, has climbed 6.6% on the day.

But not everyone is a winner. Base chain meme Toshi (TOSHI) has fallen 17.7% over the week, wholesome meme Unicorn Fart Dust (UFD) has dropped 15%, and artist-led Fwog (FWOG) has slipped 6%.

Still, many traders believe this is the start of a second phase of meme coin mania—following last year’s craziness.

The alpha crypto is up 3.3% on the day, while the rest of the market has tracked up by 0.7% in total market cap, data from CoinGecko shows.

This shift from a broader tariff implementation to a more targeted approach has eased concerns about immediate economic disruption.

Previous market fears had centered on Trump's declaration of April 2 as ""Liberation Day,"" when he planned to impose sweeping tariffs across multiple sectors.

Citing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's pronouncements last week, the WSJ reported that the administration is looking to have tariffs applied to ""about 15% of nations with persistent trade imbalances with the U.S.""

It follows the Federal Reserve’s projections last week that it would hold interest rates steady. Meanwhile, two weeks before, the Consumer Price Index saw cooling numbers, marking 2.8% from February, which some investors are interpreting as signs of easing financial conditions.

While tariffs do not directly impact Bitcoin and broader crypto prices short-term, Zach Pandl, head of research Grayscale, previously told Decrypt Trump’s trade policies are part of a larger trend, with Bitcoin being ""swept up in broader macro uncertainty.""

This suggests that ""higher policy uncertainty has caused investors to reduce portfolio risk across the board,” Pandl explained.

A study from Bloomberg shows that President Trump's implemented or threatened tariffs have affected at least $1.8 trillion in global trade, imposing 25% duties on worldwide steel and aluminum, 25% on non-compliant USMCA goods, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports.

An additional 25% tariffs on E.U. goods was also proposed. Responding to these threats and singling out Trump's crypto initiatives, an ECB official said Sunday last week that financial crises ""often originate in the United States and spread to the rest of the world.""

Meanwhile, the same study cites Bloomberg Economics forecasting a reduction in U.S. GDP by up to 0.7% while increasing inflation by 0.4%, despite Trump's claims that the tariffs, as economic measures, are designed to curb illegal immigration and address trade imbalances.

https://decrypt.co,Peter Schiff Asks For Bitcoin For His Birthday in Latest Jab at Crypto Industry,https://decrypt.co/311297/peter-schiff-bitcoin-birthday-jab-at-crypto-industry,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 03:44:05 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Peter Schiff didn’t want gifts for his 62nd birthday yesterday.

Instead, he wants Bitcoin for his new Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, which he has finally managed to transfer from an exchange into a hardware wallet, according to a post on X.

Schiff, a longtime financial commentator who was one of the few to forecast the 2008 economic crash and a founding member at Euro Pacific Asset Management, launched his so-called reserve earlier this month as a tongue-in-cheek jab at the U.S. government’s plans to introduce one.

So far, Schiff’s reserve has accumulated over $4,500, mostly from small donations. And despite his long history of bitcoin skepticism, he insists he’s in it for the long haul, claiming his strategy “is to go down with the ship, like a true HODLer!”

Schiff has been one of the loudest critics of the Trump administration’s plans for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, or any reserve containing cryptocurrencies.

Instead, he advocates for strengthening existing reserves in gold — Schiff really loves gold — or petroleum.

“The more money a country diverts to crypto, the less capital it has to fund the production of real goods and legitimate wealth creation. The worst thing any government can do is encourage or subsidize this waste of resources,” he wrote on March 7.

Schiff has also called out what he sees as an overly cozy relationship between the crypto industry and the current U.S. administration, as well as the Trump family’s own cryptocurrency ventures.

He branded the recent White House crypto summit a “disgrace” and “national embarrassment.”

Last week, he claimed that the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve initiative was nothing more than a way for the crypto industry to lure more Americans into speculative losses.

“Thanks to Trump, more Americans will lose more money in crypto than in any prior speculative mania in history. The $TRUMP meme coin, already down over 80%, is a perfect example,” he said.

Despite a brief spike over the weekend when Trump posted about the token on Truth Social, the meme coin is down 84.1% from its January 19 all-time high of $73.43, according to CoinGecko. It’s currently trading at $11.67, up 7.7% in the last 24 hours, but still a far cry from its peak.

President Donald Trump endorsed the Official Trump (TRUMP) token on social media Sunday morning, directly promoting the Solana-based meme coin in which the President’s affiliated companies hold an 80% ownership stake.

""I LOVE $TRUMP—SO COOL!!! The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Trump posted on TruthSocial at 10:33 AM ET, coinciding with a price surge that saw the token briefly top $12.25 before experiencing significant volatility.

The asset is up 7.7% on the day to $11.67, CoinGecko data shows. Still, it remains down 84% from its all-time high of $73.4 during the time it was launched January.

The price action is ""a sign that the market is no longer excitable about the Trump token,"" Luis Buenaventura, head of crypto at GCash, told Decrypt. This is still the case despite investors being aware ""of its potential for small profits in short timescales.""

While the token's website claims it is ""not intended to be an investment opportunity,"" its value proposition appears inextricably linked to Trump's personal brand and ongoing promotion.

High-risk constitutional concerns

The unprecedented development of a sitting U.S. president directly promoting a crypto asset benefiting his business interests has drawn scrutiny from ethics watchdogs and industry observers.

Andrew Rossow, digital media attorney and CEO of AR Media, a global brand impact consulting firm, told Decrypt that these activities have “unfortunately set a dangerous precedent for leveraging public office for personal financial gain.""

Rossow cites three high-risk constitutional concerns.

First of these is the Emoluments Clauses (Article 1, Sec. 9), which prohibit a sitting president from receiving financial benefits “from domestic entities or foreign governments without congressional approval,” Rossow explained.

Because of its ownership structure, the TRUMP token allows “foreign actors to purchase tokens anonymously, potentially violating these clauses by enabling indirect financial gains or undue foreign influence” over U.S. policy.

Rossow further cites the Separation of Powers (Article II, Section 3), which requires the president to “faithfully execute laws.”

Trump’s endorsement of a financial product tied to his personal wealth “undermines regulatory agencies such as the SEC and CFTC, eroding trust in impartial governance,” Rossow told Decrypt.

Moreover, under provisions for the Equal Protection and Due Process in the Fifth Amendment, Rossow argues that preferential treatment for the tokens over others could “create an uneven playing field in the crypto market, disadvantaging competitors.”

CIC Digital LLC, listed in Trump's financial disclosures as his company, and Fight Fight Fight LLC collectively control the vast majority of the token's supply, according to the project's official documentation.



These entities stand to benefit financially from increased trading activity and price appreciation.

Federal ethics laws “prohibit public officials from engaging in activities that create conflicts between their public duties and private interests,” Rossow explained. Because of the affiliated entities’ ownership of 80% of the token supply, Trump’s involvement “directly conflicts with his role as president” and “undermines public trust in impartial governance.”

Earlier this month, World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance project associated with the Trump family and principals of DT Marks DEFI LLC, profited roughly $390 million from its second round of token sales.

The TRUMP token's launch follows the president's campaign pledges to make the U.S. a leader in crypto, including initiatives to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and an end to the Federal Reserve's independence via select crypto policy.

Representatives for President Trump did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.

President Donald Trump’s decentralized finance project World Liberty Financial has launched its own stablecoin on both Ethereum and Binance’s BNB Chain, according to on-chain data.

The launch of the token, called USD1, marks the culmination of a plan that has been in the works for some months. Decrypt previously reported in October that the Trump family and its business partners were planning to issue a stablecoin—but, at the time, they were still working out issues related to the safety and legality of such a product.

With Trump back in the White House, and congressional Republicans racing to get a bill legalizing stablecoins over the finish line, it appears the World Liberty team feels the time is right for the president himself to enter the increasingly crowded—and lucrative—stablecoin market. Representatives for World Liberty Financial did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.

Stablecoins, which are generally pegged to the price of the U.S. dollar, serve as key on- and off-ramps between crypto and traditional financial markets. They allow users to park on-chain funds in currencies that remain fixed in value even when crypto markets fluctuate. Stablecoins also function as dollar equivalents in markets where dollars are restricted.

They can also offer immense profits to issuers. Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, posted a $13 billion profit last year, mainly from reinvesting customer deposits in yield-bearing U.S. Treasuries. Perhaps for that reason, the field appears poised to become inundated with competitors from all corners of crypto and the traditional finance world.

The legality of stablecoins in the U.S., however, also remains an open question. The SEC, under former President Joe Biden, sued companies like Binance for issuing stablecoins, claiming the tokens violate existing securities laws. If passed, though, the stablecoin bill currently making its way through Congress would put such legal uncertainty to bed.

World Liberty’s USD1 stablecoin is currently compatible for trading on Ethereum, one of the largest blockchain networks for decentralized finance, and on BNB, a blockchain developed by Binance. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, refers to a collection of crypto-based applications that allow for the trading, borrowing, and lending of digital assets without the need for third-party intermediaries, such as banks.

On Monday, Binance’s founder and former CEO, Changpeng, Zhao celebrated the news, posting a welcome message to World Liberty on X.

Welcome to @BNBChain! According to BSCScan, the smart contract was deployed 20 days ago. Build! 👏https://t.co/qr22y4pXqE https://t.co/J0TvwEnUin — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) March 24, 2025

Earlier this month, World Liberty announced it had completed two rounds of sales of its governance token, WLFI, netting some $550 million in the process. The project’s founders shortly thereafter teased the impending launch of “a wave of disruptive technology that will redefine the boundaries of what’s possible with digital assets.”",decrypt

The Bitcoin holdings of Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, recently surpassed 500,000 Bitcoin following its latest stock sales, the company said on Monday.

After acquiring 6,911 Bitcoin last week, the Tysons, Virginia-based firm said it now holds 506,137 Bitcoin valued at $44.2 billion, according to a press release.

The company said it purchased Bitcoin at an average price of $84,500 per coin, a slightly higher average price than the $83,000 that Strategy paid for 130 Bitcoin a week prior.

Meanwhile, Strategy said that it sold nearly two million shares of its class A common stock, a move that resulted in around $593 million in net proceeds for the firm.

The company’s stock sale was linked to an at-the-market equity offering program unveiled in October, which authorized Strategy to sell up to $21 billion in common shares. On Monday, the firm said it can still sell an additional $3.57 billion in Strategy’s stock through the program.

Separately, Strategy, which pivoted its focus from software to Bitcoin in 2020, said that it had raised $1.1 million by selling “perpetual strike preferred stock.” The Nasdaq-listed product, dubbed Strike (STRK), was unveiled in January and features an 8% cumulative dividend that’s payable in either cash or class A common shares.

Strategy’s stock price dipped to $311.36 when U.S. markets opened, according to Nasdaq. However, the company’s shares quickly recovered and were trading up 7.2% on the day.

The price of STRK, which began trading on Jan. 31, had increased 1.1% to $86.50. Its price peaked around $99 last month but has trended downward over the past month.

Strategy’ co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor hinted at the company’s latest round of Bitcoin-buying. A chart tracking the company’s Bitcoin purchases with orange dots “needs more orange,” he said on X (formerly known as Twitter) on Sunday.

Strategy spent $19.3 billion on Bitcoin last year, leveraging convertible debt and other financial products to purchase more Bitcoin than it could otherwise, according to Saylor Tracker.

As Bitcoin’s price has swooned amid President Donald Trump’s trade war and economic uncertainty, analysts say it’s become more difficult for Strategy to raise funds cheaply. On Monday, however, the firm indicated it’s still spent $5.3 billion on Bitcoin in the first quarter of this year.

The insurer, which emerged in January of this year with plans to offer bitcoin-backed liability policies for company directors and officers (D&O), claims to be the first regulated risk carrier to rely on bitcoin-only reserves to write traditional policies priced in U.S. dollars. The firm has a class 2 insurance license from the Barbados Financial Services Commission.

The crossover between crypto and insurance usually involves shoehorning existing risk categories for loss and theft into covering hot and cold versions of digital assets custody. Tabit’s approach is interesting because it explores ways firms and individuals can capitalize on their bitcoin holdings without getting involved in trading or incurring significant counterparty risk.

Tabit co-founder and CEO Stephen Stonberg said bitcoin holders are invited to contribute assets to the firm’s system of segregated reserve cells, which is managed using non-custodial tech from Fireblocks, to earn yields of around 10%. A good analogy from the world of insurance is the way accredited investors, known as “Names,” deploy assets into insurance syndicates at the Lloyd’s of London insurance market.

“For a technology like crypto, you may need a new underwriter, but the way the insurance is done is fundamentally the same as before,” Stonberg said in an interview. “We are holding our regulatory capital in bitcoin, and I think bringing in a new capital source to the insurance industry and innovating with the balance sheet is an opportunity that other people weren't really looking at.”

With its laser focus on bitcoin, Strategy has become a leading corporate example of allocating treasury reserves to vitcoin. Other public companies, like Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, have followed a similar game plan on a smaller scale.

By staking its future on bitcoin’s network effects and adoption as ‘digital gold’, Strategy aims to maximize long-term shareholder value. The company’s stock price has skyrocketed since its first BTC purchase.

US authorities are returning $7 million to victims of spoofed crypto investment platforms

Scammers gained victims’ trust before directing them to fake investment websites

Stolen funds were funneled through 75+ shell company bank accounts and sent abroad

Secret Service seized funds from a foreign bank in 2023 and initiated civil forfeiture

Victims can contact the Secret Service to petition for recovery of their losses

US authorities have begun the process of returning $7 million to victims who were tricked into sending money to fake cryptocurrency investment platforms. The announcement came from the Eastern District of Virginia’s US Attorney’s Office on March 21.

The scam involved fraudsters who contacted victims and built trust with them over time. After gaining their confidence, the scammers directed victims to websites that looked like legitimate cryptocurrency investment platforms.

These websites were designed to fool victims into thinking they were investing in real crypto opportunities. The sites showed fake data indicating that the victims’ investments were growing and making good returns.

When victims tried to withdraw their money, the scammers used pressure tactics to get them to invest even more. One common method was claiming that victims needed to pay taxes on their supposed profits before they could access their funds.

The stolen money was moved through more than 75 different bank accounts. These accounts were set up under shell companies that existed only on paper.

From Scam to Recovery

The funds were then sent to banks outside the United States. The transfers were disguised to look like normal domestic wire transfers, making them harder to track.

The United States Secret Service took action in 2023. They seized some of the stolen funds from a foreign bank and started a civil forfeiture action in a US District Court.

The foreign bank made its own claim against the seized money. US authorities eventually reached a settlement agreement for $7 million of the funds.

Victims of this scam have been told to contact the Secret Service. They can petition to recover the money they lost to the fraudsters.

This case is part of a growing trend in cryptocurrency crime. According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, crypto crime has entered a “professionalized era” dominated by efficient cyber criminal groups.

Similar scams have been reported in other countries. On March 21, Australian federal police alerted 130 people about a message scam targeting crypto users. The messages copied the same “sender ID” as legitimate exchanges like Binance.

Users on the social media platform X reported another string of scam messages on March 14. These messages pretended to be from Coinbase and Gemini and tried to trick users into setting up new wallets with recovery phrases controlled by the scammers.

Cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important in the crypto space. On March 18, cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes warned about a new type of crypto-stealing malware. The malware was hidden inside a “cracked” version of TradingView Premium software.

Microsoft’s Incident Response Team made another discovery on March 17. They found cyber scammers using a new remote access trojan that targets cryptocurrency held in 20 different wallet extensions for the Google Chrome browser.

Authorities continue to warn crypto users to be cautious when investing. They recommend using only official websites and apps from trusted exchanges and never sharing recovery phrases or private keys with anyone.",blockonomi

A top UK investment banker has called for taxes on cryptocurrency purchases to help direct more investment into the stock market. Lisa Gordon, chair of investment bank Cavendish, believes such a move could boost the UK economy.

Gordon told The Times on March 23 that the high rate of crypto ownership among younger Britons compared to stock ownership is concerning. “It should terrify all of us that over half of under-45s own crypto and no equities,” she said.

The banker suggested a policy shift that would reduce the existing tax burden on stock purchases while creating a new tax on cryptocurrency transactions. “I would love to see stamp duty cut on equities and applied to crypto,” Gordon stated.

Currently, the UK government charges a 0.5% tax on shares listed on the London Stock Exchange. This tax brings in around 3 billion British pounds ($3.9 billion) in yearly revenue for the government.

Gordon believes reducing this tax could encourage more Britons to invest in shares of local companies. This shift could then motivate more companies to list on UK exchanges, creating a positive cycle for the economy.

In contrast to stocks, Gordon describes cryptocurrency as “a non-productive asset” that “doesn’t feed back into the economy.” Her comments highlight a view that traditional investments provide more economic benefits than digital assets.

“Equities provide growth capital to companies that employ people, innovate and pay corporation tax. That is a social contract. We shouldn’t be afraid of advocating for that,” Gordon explained.

Investment Trends Shifting in UK

Crypto ownership in the UK has been growing. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) reported in November that about 12% of UK adults now own cryptocurrency, equal to around 7 million people.

The data shows that most crypto owners in the UK are under 55 years old. This age group makes up about 36% of all crypto holders in the country.

Gordon expressed worry that many Britons have “shifted to saving rather than investing.” She warned this trend “is not going to fund a viable retirement” for many people.

A 2022 FCA survey found that while 70% of UK adults had savings accounts, only 38% owned shares either directly or through investment accounts. The survey revealed nearly three in four 18-24 year olds held no investments at all.

These investment patterns exist despite UK policies that allow nearly 20,000 British pounds ($26,000) of tax-free savings per year. Only a quarter of 18-25 year olds and a third of 25-44 year olds held any investments in 2022, according to FCA data.

Recent economic challenges have made the situation worse. In the 12 months leading to January 2024, the cost of living crisis caused 44% of all adults to either stop or reduce their saving or investing activities.

Nearly a quarter of UK adults reported using their savings or selling investments just to cover day-to-day expenses during this period. This trend further reduces market participation among regular citizens.

Gordon serves on the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce, a group of industry executives working to revive the UK’s financial markets. Her bank, Cavendish, would benefit from a stronger market as it advises companies on public offerings.

The London stock market has struggled recently. Consulting firm EY reported that 2023 was one of the “quietest years on record” for the exchange, with just 18 new company listings, down from 23 in 2022.

At the same time, 88 companies either delisted or transferred from the London exchange. Many cited “declining liquidity and lower valuations compared to other markets” such as the US as reasons for leaving.

Despite these challenges, Gordon claimed the UK remains a “safe haven” compared to markets like the US. American markets have lost trillions of dollars due to President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and recession fears.

Cryptocurrency markets have also struggled recently. Bitcoin has dropped 11% over the past 30 days and has had trouble staying above $85,000 since early March.

The most recent data shows Bitcoin trading at around $85,640, up 2% in the past 24 hours.",blockonomi

Ethereum price recovered above $1,880 and is trading around $2,032, showing signs of recovery after a prolonged correction

Critical resistance levels at $2,020, $2,040, and $2,150 need to be broken for ETH to potentially reach $2,800 or even $4,000

Institutional investors continue accumulating ETH, with wallets holding at least $100,000 worth of ETH growing from 70,000 to over 75,000 between March 10-22

Major institutions like Fidelity and BlackRock are embracing Ethereum for blockchain tokenization, with BlackRock’s ETH holdings crossing $1 billion

Technical indicators suggest a potential 65% rally to $3,400 by June if ETH maintains support above $2,000

Ethereum has begun showing signs of recovery after months of bearish pressure, with the price now holding steady above the $2,000 mark. The second-largest cryptocurrency has endured a difficult three-month period that saw its value drop by over 50% from December highs, but technical indicators and institutional interest suggest a potential shift in momentum.

ETH formed a base above the $1,820 level and started a recovery wave similar to Bitcoin’s recent movement. The price cleared several resistance levels at $1,880 and $1,920 before pushing above $1,950.

Currently trading around $2,032, Ethereum is facing hurdles near the $2,020 resistance zone. There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $1,980 on the hourly chart.

The first major resistance for ETH sits near the $2,040 level. Many analysts believe that breaking above this point could send the price toward the $2,120 resistance.

If Ethereum manages to break above $2,120, it might continue rising toward $2,150 or even $2,250 in the near term. However, failure to clear these resistance levels could trigger another decline.

Initial support on the downside appears near the $1,980 level. The first major support sits at the $1,950 zone, with additional support levels at $1,880, $1,850, and $1,800.

Despite the recent price struggles, institutional investors have continued to accumulate ETH. According to Glassnode data, the number of wallets holding at least $100,000 worth of ETH grew from 70,000 on March 10 to over 75,000 by March 22.

Nansen’s analyst Nicolai Sondergaard highlighted that Ethereum whales with balances between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have increased their positions. This comes while smaller holders have been reducing their ETH holdings.

Ethereum’s futures open interest reached an unprecedented level on March 21. This suggests that large traders might be positioning themselves for a climb above $2,400.

Technical Analysis

Technical indicators point to a possible major comeback for ETH. With the price hovering close to $2,000, a crucial long-term support level, historical patterns suggest potential for strong rallies.

Previous rebounds from this multi-year support have preceded gains of over 2,000% and 360% in earlier market cycles. If ETH maintains this support, it could potentially move toward $3,400 by June—representing a 65% rise from current levels.

Major financial institutions continue to show interest in Ethereum’s blockchain technology. Fidelity Investments recently filed with US regulators to register a tokenized version of its US dollar money market fund on Ethereum.

The $5.8 trillion asset manager plans to launch “OnChain” to track transactions of the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund, an $80 billion fund primarily consisting of US Treasury bills. The filing indicates the OnChain share class is scheduled to take effect on May 30, pending regulatory approval.

Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain for real-world asset tokenization, hosting over $3.3 billion worth of tokenized assets. This is substantially higher than its closest competitor, Stellar, with $465.6 million.

BlackRock’s increasing Ethereum holdings reflect growing institutional confidence. Its BUIDL fund now holds nearly $1.145 billion worth of Ether, up from $990 million just a week earlier.

Many crypto analysts believe Ethereum must reclaim the “macro range” above $2,200 to reverse its three-month declining trend. According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, ETH needs to generate a strong enough reaction to reclaim the $2,196-$3,900 macro range.

While short-term market volatility may continue due to global economic concerns, the long-term outlook for Ethereum appears positive. Investment firm VanEck projects a $6,000 price target for ETH during 2025, representing a substantial increase from current levels.

For ETH to maintain bullish momentum, it must first overcome resistance at $2,020 and $2,040. Breaking past these levels could open the path toward higher targets at $2,120, $2,150, and beyond.",blockonomi

Peter Schiff, a known Bitcoin critic, asked for Bitcoin donations to his satirical “Bitcoin Strategic Reserve” for his 62nd birthday

Schiff’s reserve has collected over $4,500 in Bitcoin (0.05 BTC) and he recently moved it from an exchange to a hardware wallet

He has been critical of the Trump administration’s plans for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, preferring gold or petroleum reserves

Schiff has also started collecting Solana in what he calls his “Crypto Stockpile,” kept separate from his Bitcoin reserve

Despite his long history of Bitcoin skepticism, Schiff claims he will “go down with the ship, like a true HODLer”

Peter Schiff, one of the most vocal critics of Bitcoin, is now collecting the cryptocurrency for his own “Bitcoin Strategic Reserve.” The financial commentator marked his 62nd birthday on March 23 by asking for Bitcoin donations instead of traditional gifts.

Schiff launched his reserve earlier this month as a satirical response to the U.S. government’s plans to create a similar reserve. The move comes as a surprise to many, given his well-known skepticism about cryptocurrencies.

The reserve now holds about 0.05 Bitcoin, worth around $4,500. Most of this has come from small donations from the public.

In a recent update, Schiff announced he had moved his Bitcoin holdings from an exchange to a hardware wallet. This step is often taken by long-term holders who want more security for their digital assets.

Schiff has made it clear that contributions to his reserve are not personal donations. He insists that the Bitcoin in the reserve will never be sold or touched by him.

“My strategy is to go down with the ship, like a true HODLer!” Schiff wrote on social media platform X. His use of the term “HODL” – a crypto community slang meaning to hold onto coins rather than sell – seems to mock the belief system of Bitcoin supporters.

Beyond Bitcoin, Schiff has also started collecting Solana. He keeps these tokens separate from his Bitcoin reserve in what he calls his “Crypto Stockpile,” which remains in his exchange wallet.

Critic and Collector: Schiff’s Crypto Paradox

This dual approach shows how Schiff views these assets differently. He appears to see Bitcoin as something for a long-term reserve, while treating Solana as something else entirely.

Despite creating his own reserve, Schiff continues to criticize the Trump administration’s plans for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He has argued that governments should focus on strengthening existing reserves in gold or petroleum instead.

The crypto industry is using the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to scam more Americans into buying crypto. Thanks to Trump, more Americans will lose more money in crypto than in any prior speculative mania in history. The $TRUMP meme coin, already down over 80%, is a perfect example. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) March 20, 2025

“The more money a country diverts to crypto, the less capital it has to fund the production of real goods and legitimate wealth creation,” Schiff wrote on March 7. “The worst thing any government can do is encourage or subsidize this waste of resources.”

Schiff has also spoken out against what he sees as an overly friendly relationship between the crypto industry and the current U.S. administration. He called a recent White House crypto summit a “disgrace” and “national embarrassment.”

The crypto summit is a disgrace. It's a national embarrassment. The crypto faction that has captured the White House is precisely what our Founding Fathers warned us about. It will be a blight on whatever legacy Trump leaves and marks a low point for the presidency and the U.S.A. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) March 7, 2025

His criticisms extend to the Trump family’s cryptocurrency ventures as well. Schiff pointed to the $TRUMP meme coin as an example of harmful speculation, noting it has dropped more than 80% from its peak value.

“Thanks to Trump, more Americans will lose more money in crypto than in any prior speculative mania in history,” he claimed. The $TRUMP meme coin is currently trading at $11.67, down 84.1% from its January all-time high of $73.43.

President Trump recently addressed the Digital Asset Summit conference in New York, where he vowed to make America the “undisputed Bitcoin superpower and crypto capital of the world.” This marked the first time a sitting U.S. president has addressed a crypto industry conference.

Schiff has previously urged the government to sell Bitcoin it has seized rather than hold it. Last December, he suggested that President Biden should liquidate all federally held Bitcoin before leaving office, arguing it would reduce the 2024 budget deficit.

Schiff’s background gives weight to his financial opinions. He was one of the few commentators to correctly predict the 2008 economic crash and is a founding member at Euro Pacific Asset Management.

His approach to cryptocurrency appears to mix skepticism with pragmatism. While he continues to criticize Bitcoin publicly, his creation of a personal reserve suggests he may see some value in holding the asset.

For now, Schiff’s Bitcoin reserve remains modest compared to his strong opinions. But his willingness to accept and hold cryptocurrency marks an interesting development from someone who has spent years as one of the industry’s loudest critics.",blockonomi

TRUMP token surged 12% after President Donald Trump endorsed it on Truth Social, calling it “the greatest of them all”

The token is currently trading around $11.85, down 85% from its all-time high of $77

Trading volume exceeded $1 billion after Trump’s post, double the average of previous days

40 million TRUMP tokens (valued at $472 million) will be unlocked starting April 18, potentially increasing selling pressure

House Democrats introduced the MEME Act to prohibit federal officials and their families from profiting off meme coins

Donald Trump’s official memecoin jumped 12% on Monday after the U.S. President posted on Truth Social, calling the TRUMP token “the greatest of them all” and “cool.” The endorsement sent the Solana-based cryptocurrency from around $10.93 to approximately $12.25 in minutes following the post.

The token has since retreated slightly. It’s currently trading at around $11.85, representing a 9% increase over the past 24 hours. This makes it the best performing cryptocurrency during Asian trading hours, according to CoinGecko data.

“I LOVE $TRUMP — SO COOL!!! The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” Trump wrote to his 9.3 million Truth Social followers on Sunday. The enthusiastic endorsement immediately caught investors’ attention.

The surge in price was accompanied by a spike in trading volume. Daily trading reached over $1 billion, which is double the average volume of previous days.

Despite the recent boost, the token remains far below its peak value. TRUMP is still down approximately 85% from its all-time high of $77 reached shortly after its January launch.

The Solana-based memecoin was created on January 17, 2025. It quickly captured the crypto community’s attention in its early days.

The token reached a peak market capitalization of about $15 billion just two days after its launch. This swift rise occurred right before President Trump’s inauguration on January 20.

The initial token distribution included 200 million TRUMP tokens. The project plans to expand the supply to 1 billion tokens over three years.

Token Distribution and Upcoming Challenges

A Chainalysis report revealed some facts about token ownership. Around 94% of TRUMP and MELANIA tokens (the latter being a separate token associated with the First Lady) are held by just 40 wallets.

This concentration raises concerns about centralization within the token’s ecosystem. A small number of “whale” holders could have major influence over the token’s price.

The memecoin faces additional challenges in the coming weeks. Starting April 18, 40 million TRUMP tokens will be unlocked and enter circulation.

This unlock represents about 4% of the total supply and is valued at over $472 million. After this initial unlock, at least half a million TRUMP tokens will enter circulation daily until the end of 2027.

Some investors worry that this unlocking schedule could increase selling pressure. “Trump is shilling TRUMP coin on Truth Social… Seems like they are grabbing some exit liquidity before the unlock,” commented one investor identified as HENRI.SOL.

The token has also drawn political attention. House Democrats, led by Rep. Sam Liccardo, have introduced the MEME Act, which aims to prohibit federal officials and their families from profiting off meme coins.

In a blog post, Rep. Liccardo specifically mentioned the TRUMP token. He accused the First Family of “exploiting the public through meme coins” and warned about potential insider trading and foreign influence.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has stated that memecoins like the TRUMP token are not securities. This means they are not subject to SEC oversight under current regulations.

Earlier this year in January, President Trump commented on his limited knowledge about the token. “I don’t know much about it other than I launched it,” Trump told reporters at the time. “I heard it was very successful. I haven’t checked.”

The President’s recent direct promotion marks a shift from his earlier stance of limited involvement. This change has raised questions among legal experts about the precedent it sets.

Andrew Rossow, a digital media attorney and CEO of AR Media, told Decrypt that these posts “unfortunately set a dangerous precedent for leveraging public office for personal financial gain.”",blockonomi

SEC dropped its lawsuit against Ripple Labs, sparking optimism for XRP

Analysts predict XRP could reach $6-$27 in 2025-2026, with longer-term targets of $10 by 2030

XRP currently trading in $2.35-$2.55 range, forming a symmetrical triangle pattern

Technical indicators show mixed signals with RSI at 51.45 indicating balanced pressure

Ripple Labs IPO rumors further boosting bullish sentiment for XRP

XRP has been gaining momentum among investors after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped its long-standing lawsuit against Ripple Labs last week. This legal resolution marks a turning point for the cryptocurrency.

The current price of XRP hovers around $2.39. It has been trading in a range between $2.35 and $2.55, forming what analysts call a symmetrical triangle pattern. This pattern often suggests a breakout is coming soon.

Bitget analyst Ryan Lee noted that a breakout from this trading range could lead to large price movements. “Short-term price targets range from $2.00-$2.17 on the downside to $2.65-$3.00 on the upside,” Lee said.

The exponential moving averages on the 4-hour chart are converging near current levels. The 20 EMA sits at $2.39 while the 200 EMA is at $2.40, acting as immediate resistance for the price.

If XRP moves above the $2.40-$2.42 level, it could rally toward $2.55 and possibly reach $2.88. However, if it fails to hold the $2.28 support level, the price might drop toward $2.18-$2.20 or even $2.00.

Technical Analysis

Technical indicators are showing mixed signals with a slight bullish tilt. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51.45, which indicates balanced buying and selling pressure in the market.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a minor positive crossover. The MACD line is at 0.0022 versus the signal at 0.0065, though the histogram remains small.

Looking at longer-term forecasts, some analysts are very optimistic about XRP’s future. Analyst Egrag Crypto predicts the token could reach between $6 and $27 between 2025 and 2026, following what he describes as a “post-breakout correction.”

According to Egrag’s analysis, XRP had a 283% recovery after breaking out of a symmetrical triangle pattern following the US election in November 2024. Since then, it has shown steady gains in the monthly chart.

Not everyone agrees with these high price targets. Critics point out that Egrag has made overly bullish predictions in the past. Some also argue that his forecast doesn’t account for “diminishing returns” across market cycles as the cryptocurrency market matures.

Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, noted that XRP has shown less volatility during recent crypto market selloffs. This could be a sign that sentiment is leaning bullish for XRP.

Looking even further ahead, some analysts predict XRP could reach $10 by 2030. This long-term forecast is based on several factors including regulatory clarity, adoption of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, and the possibility of a Ripple Labs IPO.

The IPO rumors have been heating up recently. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse mentioned in an interview last week that going public was “possible,” which has provided more reasons for bullish positioning.

On the daily price chart, XRP is moving within a descending triangle pattern. The $2.88 level remains a major resistance barrier, while $2.28 is a key support level that held during the last correction.

A daily close above $2.55 could signal a shift in favor of bulls. Conversely, if the price closes below $2.28, it risks falling further toward $2.00 or even $1.85.

The Bollinger Bands indicator has contracted notably, with the price trading near the mid-band at $2.40. This narrowing suggests that a period of increased volatility may be approaching for XRP.",blockonomi

Whale activity has increased, with dormant investors acquiring billions of SHIB tokens

Current price hovers around $0.00001292-$0.00001303, up from a recent low of $0.00001085

Price predictions range from moderate growth to reaching $0.000081 (a 500% surge) depending on market conditions

Shiba Inu’s price has stabilized in recent days, trading at approximately $0.00001303 as of latest reports. This represents a modest recovery from its year-to-date low of $0.00001085 earlier this month.

The meme coin remains about 62% below its November peak. This decline reduced its market capitalization from $19 billion to around $7.5 billion.

Recent developments have sparked renewed interest in the dog-themed cryptocurrency. SHIB community executive and marketing lead Lucie highlighted factors that could make Shiba Inu a candidate for an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).

According to Lucie, SHIB is available on more than 110 exchanges with 212 trading pairs. This includes all major crypto trading platforms.

SHIB is listed on over 110 exchanges with 212 trading pairs—including all the major platforms.

It’s basically everywhere: easy to access, easy to trade. Is SHIB good for an ETF?

YES. Will boomers invest in a “doggy coin”?

Also yes.

“Because SHIB isn’t just a meme—it’s decentralized, community-driven, and built to last,” Lucie stated in a recent post on X. This global accessibility makes it potentially suitable for an ETF product.

The ETF speculation comes amid broader market optimism around crypto-backed ETF filings. The US SEC recently acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for a Dogecoin ETF.

Canary Capital has filed an S-1 for SUI ETF approval. There are also rumors about a potential BlackRock Dogecoin ETF filing.

Adding to investor optimism is an extraordinary surge in SHIB’s burn rate. Reports indicate an increase between 8,454% and 62,000% in recent days.

Over 1 billion tokens were burned in a 24-hour period. A single wallet address (0x55b8979a8d79f2802c79ff5a5083a0d7fdc182e3) was responsible for burning 1 billion tokens.

The burn mechanism permanently reduces the circulating supply by sending tokens to a null address. After this massive burn event, the total circulating supply stands at approximately 584.35 trillion coins.

Market Analysis

Market interest in SHIB derivatives has also increased. Shiba Inu futures open interest rose by 3.5% to $121.69 million, with derivatives volume spiking 24% to $71.18 million.

Whale activity has been another point of interest. Large investors have reportedly increased their SHIB holdings, with a previously dormant Ethereum whale acquiring billions of tokens.

The Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) indicator has risen to 82, up from the year-to-date low of 39. This suggests longer-term holding patterns among investors.

Technical analysts point to several patterns suggesting potential upward movement. The coin has formed a falling wedge pattern, often considered a bullish sign.

The Percentage Price Oscillator and Relative Strength Index have tilted upwards. Some analysts have identified a quadruple bottom at $0.00001235, potentially indicating a price floor.

Price predictions for SHIB vary widely. Conservative estimates suggest it could reach $0.000013 by the end of 2025, indicating modest growth.

More optimistic forecasts project values between $0.0000167 and $0.0000741. Some analysts have even suggested a 500% surge to $0.000081, dependent on continued token burns and positive market sentiment.

One analyst has made a bold claim that SHIB could eventually reach $0.01, representing an 83,000% increase. This prediction cites SHIB’s deflationary nature compared to Bitcoin’s inflation, its utility through the Shibarium layer-2 network, and global partnerships.

However, challenges remain for SHIB’s price recovery. The cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, and regulatory developments could impact investor sentiment.

Competition from other meme coins and alternative cryptocurrencies could divert investment away from SHIB. The Shibarium ecosystem, while promising, remains in early stages of development.

For now, many analysts believe SHIB’s price could potentially retest the resistance level at $0.00001855, representing a 45% increase from current levels. A drop below $0.00001085 would invalidate this bullish outlook.",blockonomi

White House signals more targeted approach to April 2 tariffs, leading to Bitcoin gaining 2.7%

Bitcoin traded above $86,700 Sunday, showing resilience after volatile swings last week

Trump hinted at “flexibility” in tariff plans, particularly regarding China

Global markets showed positive reaction with S&P 500 futures adding 0.9% on news of targeted tariffs

Economic forecasts show reduced GDP expectations for US (2.2% for 2025) and globally (3.1% for 2025)

Bitcoin and global stock markets rallied Monday following reports that the Trump administration plans to implement more targeted tariffs than previously expected. The news eased fears of widespread economic disruption that had weighed on financial markets in recent weeks.

Bitcoin regained momentum Sunday with a 2.7% increase after reports emerged from Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal about the White House’s narrowed tariff strategy. The cryptocurrency’s resilience pushed it above $86,700 by Sunday midnight.

This represents a 3.3% gain for the day. The broader crypto market followed suit with a 0.7% increase in total market cap, according to data from CoinGecko.

The positive movement comes after a volatile week for Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency had dipped as low as $81,200 before recovering on the tariff news.

President Trump previously declared April 2 as “Liberation Day,” when he planned to impose sweeping tariffs across many economic sectors. The administration now appears to be taking a more measured approach.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated last week that tariffs would apply to “about 15% of nations with persistent trade imbalances with the U.S.” This more focused strategy has helped ease market concerns about widespread economic impacts.

Trump Signals Flexibility

During Oval Office remarks, Trump hinted at some flexibility in his approach. “I don’t change. But the word flexibility is an important word,” Trump said. “Sometimes it’s flexibility. So there’ll be flexibility, but basically it’s reciprocal.”

The president specifically mentioned China in his comments. He suggested there would be room for “talk” on trade issues with the country and expressed hope to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping soon.

Global stock markets also responded positively to the news. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index opened 0.5% higher on Monday, with gains led by tariff-sensitive sectors like commodity producers and automakers.

S&P 500 futures added 0.9%, breaking a four-week streak of losses. This positive movement came as markets had been on edge ahead of Trump’s April 2 deadline.

Daniel Murray, chief executive officer of EFG Asset Management in Zurich, explained the market reaction: “Markets have taken some comfort from news that the next stage of the Trump administration’s tariff regime will involve targeted tariffs.”

Murray added that “this raises the possibility that some sectors and countries may fare better than others, helping explain market optimism.”

The Federal Reserve recently held interest rates steady, which along with cooling Consumer Price Index numbers (2.8% in February), has been interpreted by some investors as signs of easing financial conditions.

While tariffs do not directly impact Bitcoin prices in the short term, Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale, told Decrypt that Trump’s trade policies are part of a larger trend. Bitcoin has been “swept up in broader macro uncertainty,” according to Pandl.

A Bloomberg study shows that President Trump’s implemented or threatened tariffs have affected at least $1.8 trillion in global trade. These include 25% duties on worldwide steel and aluminum, 25% on non-compliant USMCA goods, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports.

Despite the market rally, economic forecasters have reduced their growth outlooks. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development revised its U.S. GDP forecasts from 2.4% to 2.2% for 2025 and from 2.1% to 1.6% for 2026.

Global GDP was also revised lower, from 3.3% to 3.1% in 2025 and 3.3% to 3.0% in 2026. The OECD cited “higher trade barriers in several G20 economies and increased geopolitical and policy uncertainty” as factors “weighing on investment and household spending.”

The European Union announced it was delaying its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods to allow for “additional time for discussions with the U.S. administration.” However, the EU maintained it was not seeking to “diminish the impact of our response.”

In commodities markets, oil edged higher, benefiting from the prospect of more targeted trade tariffs. Gold traded around $3,022 an ounce, just off record highs reached last week.

The latest developments suggest the White House is refining its approach to tariffs, balancing its trade objectives against potential market and economic impacts. Markets appear to be responding favorably to this more nuanced strategy.",blockonomi

Solana price jumped 7% to $140 with daily trading volumes surging 85-94.9% to $2.56-2.67 billion

Analysts predict potential rally toward $150-$420 following a key breakout above $137

Network adoption reached an all-time high with over 11.09 million addresses holding SOL

Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko advocates for Layer 1 solutions over Layer 2 alternatives

White House narrowing approach to tariffs set for April 2 is supporting crypto market recovery

Solana (SOL) is making strong moves in the crypto market, gaining 7% to reach $140 amid a broader market recovery. This price jump comes with a sharp increase in trading activity, as daily volumes surged between 85% and 94.9% to reach over $2.56 billion.

The renewed investor interest in Solana coincides with record-breaking network adoption. On-chain data shows that the Solana network now has more than 11.09 million addresses holding the SOL token, marking an all-time high in user participation within the ecosystem.

This surge happens even as long-term Solana holders show signs of extreme fear. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez points out that such periods of uncertainty often create opportunities for strategic investors, noting that “Historically, these are the moments smart money steps in.” This follows the classic investment wisdom of being “greedy when others are fearful.”

Market Analysis

Technical analysis suggests Solana has achieved an important breakthrough. The cryptocurrency has broken past the crucial resistance level of $137, potentially ending a persistent downtrend that began after the January 20th highs.

This technical breakout has sparked optimism among market analysts. Crypto Curb, a popular analyst, suggests this move signals the start of new upward momentum for SOL, with forecasts pointing to a potential rally toward $420 in the near future.

Another analyst, Satoshi Flipper, identified a symmetrical triangle pattern on Solana’s 4-hour chart. This pattern typically signals a continuation of the previous trend once price breaks out of the formation. With SOL closing above the upper trendline at $132, the analyst projects a price target of around $152.

The technical outlook remains positive as SOL extends its gains to trade above $138. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart is recovering from oversold conditions and reads 49, pointing upward just below its neutral level of 50, indicating weakening bearish momentum.

Further support for this upward movement comes from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which showed a bullish crossover last week. This technical signal suggests more upside potential ahead.

The broader cryptocurrency market is also finding support from external factors. Recent reports indicate that the White House is narrowing its approach to tariffs set to take effect on April 2. The plans likely omit a set of industry-specific tariffs while applying reciprocal levies on a targeted set of nations that account for the bulk of foreign trade with the US.

This news has set a positive tone in the crypto market during early Asian trading, with major cryptocurrencies rising. Bitcoin broke above $87,000, and Solana followed the upward trend.

Adding to the Solana ecosystem narrative, co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko recently expressed skepticism about the necessity of Layer 2 scaling solutions. According to Yakovenko, Layer 1 blockchains can deliver superior performance with greater speed, lower costs, and enhanced security compared to Layer 2 alternatives.

In a message on the X platform, he wrote: “L1s can be faster, cheaper, and more secure. They aren’t slowed down by a glacially moving L1 data availability stack, or have to compromise security with complex fraud proofs and upgrade multisigs.”

His comments came in response to an Ethereum contributor who suggested there’s no reason to build Layer 1 solutions when Layer 2s are faster and more affordable.

In an interesting development for the Solana ecosystem, former President Donald Trump posted support for the TRUMP memecoin on Solana via his Truth Social platform on Sunday. Trump wrote, “I LOVE $TRUMP — SO COOL!!! The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”

This endorsement led to a spike in Trump memecoin prices by nearly 17%, reaching a high of $12.51 on the day. However, the memecoin remains down 85% from its all-time high of $77.24 set in January, according to Binance data.

Looking ahead, if Solana continues its upward trend, technical analysis suggests it could extend the rally by 15% from current trading levels to retest its next daily resistance at $160. However, traders should remain cautious, as a decline below daily support at $118.10 could extend to test March lows around $112.",blockonomi

Over 172,705 BTC acquired since February 23, signaling increased market demand

Bitcoin trading at $87,127 as of Monday, March 24, 2025

Trump administration expected to implement targeted rather than broad tariffs on April 2

Institutional investors showing continued interest with six consecutive days of ETF inflows

Arthur Hayes predicts Bitcoin could reach $110,000 before retesting the $76,500 mark

Bitcoin’s price has surged to $87,127 as of Monday morning, showing a 3.46% increase in trading. The jump comes as investors react positively to reports that President Donald Trump may take a more measured approach to implementing new trade tariffs.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency has been experiencing high volatility in recent weeks. Price swings saw Bitcoin drop below $80,000 before rebounding to current levels around $87,000.

Rather than imposing broad industry-wide tariffs, the Trump administration is expected to target specific countries with major trade imbalances with the United States. This group, reportedly dubbed the “dirty 15,” could include major economies such as China, Japan, India, and Vietnam.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that countries might be able to negotiate to avoid higher tariffs. Nations could potentially reduce their own trade barriers as a way to avoid new U.S. tariffs.

The more targeted approach to tariffs has helped ease market concerns about trade tensions. This has led to increased confidence in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin’s recent price movement comes alongside a major accumulation phase. Over 172,705 BTC have been acquired since February 23, indicating growing demand in the market.

This increase in demand mirrors similar activity seen after the FTX collapse. That period marked the bottom of the market before a recovery phase began.

Network data also shows encouraging signs of growth. Active Bitcoin addresses have risen by 0.96%, reaching a total of 8.7151 million users.

Transaction counts have surged by 1.66%, totaling nearly 500,000 transactions. These metrics highlight strong user engagement and reflect interest from both retail and institutional investors.

Big Money Moves In

The NVT Golden Cross, a metric that analyzes the relationship between Bitcoin’s network value and transaction activity, has surged by 34.58%. This suggests strengthening network fundamentals and growing investor confidence.

Institutional investors continue to fuel Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have recorded six consecutive days of inflows, showing renewed demand from larger investors.

Japanese Bitcoin investment firm Metaplanet Inc has been increasing its holdings. The company currently holds over 3,200 BTC and plans to grow its reserves to 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025.

In a move that connects the crypto world with the political sphere, Metaplanet has named Eric Trump to its Strategic Board of Advisors. The son of President Donald Trump is expected to support the company’s expansion strategy with his experience in finance and branding.

Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes remains bullish on Bitcoin’s future. He predicts Bitcoin will surge to $110,000 before testing the $76,500 mark again.

I bet $BTC hits $110k before it retests $76.5k. Y? The Fed is going from QT to QE for treasuries. And tariffs don’t matter cause “transitory inflation”. JAYPOW told me so. I’ll expound on that in my next essay, that’s the TLDR for your TikTok peanut brain. — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) March 24, 2025

Hayes bases his optimism on expectations that the Federal Reserve will shift from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing. This change could inject more liquidity into risk assets like Bitcoin.

This week, market attention will focus on the Federal Reserve’s core PCE price index, the central bank’s preferred inflation gauge. Analysts expect a slight uptick from 2.6% to 2.7%, which could influence market sentiment for Bitcoin and other digital assets.

With technical indicators pointing to a potential breakout and fundamental metrics showing strength, Bitcoin appears to be entering a new phase of growth. The combination of institutional interest and improving network metrics suggests the rally may have room to continue.",blockonomi

US Treasury removed Tornado Cash from sanctions list on March 21, 2025, following a November 2024 court ruling that OFAC overstepped its authority

Treasury claims the lawsuit is now “moot” and no final court judgment is needed

Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal argues this is “voluntary cessation” and requires assurance the behavior won’t recur

Tornado Cash was sanctioned in August 2022 for allegedly laundering over $7.6 billion in crypto assets

Co-founders Roman Storm and Roman Semenov face legal challenges, with Storm expected to face trial in April

The U.S. Treasury Department officially removed Tornado Cash from its sanctions list on March 21, 2025, reversing sanctions imposed in August 2022. The move came after a November 2024 federal appeals court ruling that found the Treasury had exceeded its authority.

The cryptocurrency mixer had been accused of facilitating money laundering activities. Regulators claimed it helped process more than $7.6 billion worth of virtual assets since its creation in 2019.

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) had placed Tornado Cash on its Specially Designated Nationals list. They also targeted over 100 Ethereum wallet addresses associated with the platform.

The November 2024 court decision stated that OFAC “overstepped its congressionally defined authority.” The ruling centered on the fact that Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts cannot be considered “property” under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

Following the delisting, the Treasury Department argued the case should be considered resolved. They stated in court documents that because Tornado Cash had been removed from the sanctions list, the lawsuit was now “moot.”

The Treasury further claimed the court should assess whether it still has jurisdiction. They noted that federal courts have a “continuing obligation to satisfy itself” on matters of Article III jurisdiction.

Legal Battle Escalates After Sanctions Removal

However, Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal strongly disagrees with this approach. In a March 24 post on X, he criticized the Treasury’s attempt to avoid a final court judgment.

“Power does not recede voluntarily. It gasps and it gasps until it no longer can,” Grewal wrote. “After grudgingly delisting TC, they now claim they’ve mooted any need for a final court judgment. But that’s not the law, and they know it.”

Relying on that decision, the Fifth Circuit rejected an agency’s argument that its withdrawal of a determination “unilaterally and avoid judicial review” did not moot the case, because the agency could decide to revisit the decision and issue a similar determination against the… — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) March 23, 2025

Grewal argues this is a textbook example of “voluntary cessation.” This legal principle applies when a defendant ends a contested action to avoid a court ruling.

For voluntary cessation to apply, there must be clear assurance that the behavior will not happen again. Grewal points out that the Treasury has provided no such guarantee.

He referenced a 2024 Supreme Court decision involving a U.S. citizen who had been removed from the No Fly List. In that case, the court found the matter was not moot because the government failed to assure the individual would not be placed back on the list.

“Treasury has likewise removed the Tornado Cash entities from the SDN, but has provided no assurance that it will not re-list Tornado Cash again,” Grewal stated. “That’s not good enough, and will make this clear to the district court.”

The legal challenges began in September 2022. Six Tornado Cash users, led by Ethereum core developer Preston Van Loon and supported by Coinbase, sued the Treasury to reverse the sanctions.

Crypto policy advocacy group Coin Center filed a similar lawsuit in October 2022. While a Texas federal court initially sided with the Treasury in August 2023, an appeals court later ruled that the sanctions against Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts were unlawful.

The Treasury had 60 days to challenge this decision but ultimately lost. The U.S. court overturned the sanctions on January 21, requiring the government agency to remove them by March.

Despite the removal of sanctions, the developers behind Tornado Cash still face legal troubles. The U.S. charged co-founders Roman Storm and Roman Semenov in August 2023 with helping launder over $1 billion in cryptocurrency through the platform.

Roman Semenov remains at large and appears on the FBI’s most wanted list. Roman Storm is currently free on a $2 million bond and expected to face trial in April.

Meanwhile, Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev has seen some relief in his legal situation. A Dutch court suspended his pretrial detention, allowing him to be released from prison under electronic monitoring while he focuses on appealing his conviction.

In the midst of these legal proceedings, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the department’s commitment to fighting illicit finance. “Digital assets present enormous opportunities for innovation and value creation for the American people,” Bessent said.

The Treasury stated it remains dedicated to using its powers to combat malicious cyber actors. They specifically mentioned targeting North Korea’s ability to fund weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs through digital assets.

The ongoing dispute highlights the complex balance between regulating cryptocurrency services and respecting the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. As the legal process continues, both the crypto industry and regulators are watching closely for a final resolution.",blockonomi

Metaplanet’s BTC Yield (measuring Bitcoin growth vs. shares) reached 68.3% in Q1 2025

The company has used stock acquisition rights and zero-coupon bonds to finance its Bitcoin acquisitions

Metaplanet’s stock price has risen over 3,000% since it began accumulating Bitcoin in April 2024

Tokyo-based investment firm Metaplanet has added 150 Bitcoin (BTC) to its treasury, bringing its total holdings to 3,350 BTC. The company announced the purchase on Monday, March 24, 2025.

The additional Bitcoin was acquired at an average price of ¥12.57 million ($80,000) per BTC. This brings the total investment to approximately $291 million at current market rates.

Metaplanet has established itself as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in Asia. The company has been steadily building its Bitcoin reserves as part of its treasury strategy.

The average purchase price across all of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings is ¥12.60 million ($80,200) per BTC. The company has spent ¥42.22 billion ($270 million) in total on its Bitcoin acquisitions.

Metaplanet has used stock acquisition rights through EVO FUND and zero-coupon bonds to finance these purchases. This approach has allowed the company to buy Bitcoin without taking on interest-bearing debt.

In March alone, the company redeemed ¥2 billion ($12.8 million) in bonds ahead of schedule. It then raised another ¥2 billion through a new bond issuance to continue its Bitcoin buying strategy.

Bitcoin Strategy Paying Off

Metaplanet tracks its Bitcoin strategy using a metric called BTC Yield. This calculates the percentage increase in Bitcoin holdings compared to fully diluted shares over time.

The company’s BTC Yield was 41.7% from July to September 2024. It then jumped to 309.8% from October to December 2024 as Bitcoin prices soared.

For the first quarter of 2025 (January 1 to March 24), Metaplanet has achieved a BTC Yield of 68.3%. This shows continued growth in its Bitcoin holdings relative to shares.

Since Metaplanet began accumulating Bitcoin in April 2024, its stock price has risen by over 3,000%. This indicates strong investor confidence in the company’s strategy.

In a related development, Metaplanet recently announced the creation of a new strategic advisory board. Eric Trump, son of U.S. President Donald Trump, has been named as its first member.

The appointment was announced on March 21, just days before the latest Bitcoin purchase. Eric Trump brings his background in real estate and finance to the company.

Metaplanet’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, stated that the advisory board will include influential voices and thought leaders. These individuals will be committed to advancing Bitcoin adoption.

Dylan LeClair, Head of Bitcoin Strategy at Metaplanet, shared on social media that the company ended the day as the 13th most liquid stock in Japan. It recorded a daily trading volume of $336.6 million, surpassing both Toyota and Nintendo.

Metaplanet’s stock closed up 7% on Monday, finishing above 5,000 yen. The company’s year-to-date price performance shows an increase of 35.92%.",blockonomi

Dogecoin is approaching a critical breakout point with strong support at $0.139-$0.17

Analyst Kevin indicates that DOGE needs to maintain above $0.139 for bullish momentum

Carl Moon predicts a potential 157% surge to $0.434 if DOGE breaks above $0.185

Increased whale accumulation and network activity support a bullish outlook

Recent price action shows DOGE tested $0.1650 and is attempting recovery toward $0.180

Dogecoin has been moving within a technical pattern that suggests a potential breakout is near. The popular meme cryptocurrency recently reached $0.18 before falling back, testing support levels around $0.165. This price action has caught the attention of several analysts who believe DOGE may be setting up for its next big move.

The cryptocurrency has formed what analysts describe as a falling wedge pattern since its January peak of $0.435. This pattern shows a series of lower highs and lower lows, narrowing toward what could be a major breakout point.

Crypto analyst Kevin highlighted the importance of the $0.139 support level for Dogecoin. He noted that DOGE received a “weekly demand candle” at what he calls the “last line of bull market support.” Maintaining this level is vital for the bullish case to remain intact.

Kevin explained that several technical indicators are resetting. The Weekly Stoch RSI is already fully reset, while the 3-Day MACD is approaching a reset state. The Two-Week Stoch RSI may need about another month to align with the lower region.

Technical Analysis

These technical resets could signal diminishing downward pressure. When such indicators reset from oversold conditions, they often precede price recoveries as selling exhaustion gives way to renewed buying interest.

Another analyst, Carl Moon, predicts a significant upside if DOGE breaks out of its current pattern. According to Moon, if Dogecoin closes above $0.185 on the daily chart, it could confirm a structural breakout.

Following such a breakout, Moon projects a 157% rally. This would take DOGE to approximately $0.434, nearly matching its previous high from earlier this year.

Analyst Whalesdesk identified strong support for Dogecoin between $0.16 and $0.17. This support zone has prevented further downside movement and could serve as a launching pad for higher prices.

Whalesdesk outlined a more ambitious price target, suggesting DOGE could reach a four-year high of $0.60. Before reaching this level, the cryptocurrency would need to overcome resistance areas at $0.30 and $0.45.

On-chain data shows growing whale activity supporting the bullish outlook. Large holders have been accumulating DOGE at current price levels, which historically has preceded major price movements.

The Dogecoin network has seen increased user engagement in recent weeks. Daily active addresses have grown, indicating more people are transacting with DOGE tokens.

Transaction volumes have also increased on the network. Higher transaction activity often reflects growing demand for a cryptocurrency and can support price trends.

Dogecoin developers continue working on network improvements. These upgrades aim to enhance transaction speed and reduce fees, potentially supporting wider adoption and use cases.

The recent price action shows DOGE finding a low at $0.1646 before attempting a recovery. The price has moved above both the $0.1680 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average, suggesting short-term strength.

A bullish trend line has formed with support at $0.1680 on the hourly chart. If this support holds, it could provide a foundation for further gains toward the $0.1755 and $0.18 resistance levels.

If Dogecoin fails to break above $0.1755, it could face another decline. The next support levels would be $0.172, $0.168, and the critical $0.165 area. A break below $0.165 could send the price toward $0.162 or even $0.155.

The overall market has experienced some fluctuations following Federal Reserve policy decisions. These macroeconomic factors have influenced investor sentiment across digital assets, including Dogecoin.

Kevin tied DOGE’s prospects to Bitcoin’s performance, noting that if Bitcoin holds above $70,000, the outlook for Dogecoin remains positive. This highlights the connection between Bitcoin’s movements and the broader altcoin market.",blockonomi

The latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is the main catalyst driving BTC’s recent prediction. The Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates has been a crucial driver for risk assets.

Bitcoin responds positively to signs of monetary policy easing. Historically, dovish Fed policies have fueled crypto rallies. As inflation cools and economic conditions stabilize, investors are increasingly bullish on Bitcoin’s trajectory. As Bitcoin’s rally fuels optimism across the broader crypto market, BinoFi’s 1700% surge signals broader market optimism.

FOMC’s Impact on Bitcoin: What the Latest Fed Decision Means for Crypto

Bitcoin’s recent price action around $84,000 has placed traders on high alert as the Federal Reserve prepares to announce its latest stance on interest rates. While market consensus suggests that rates will remain unchanged, investors are watching for any dovish signals from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that could indicate a shift toward monetary easing.

Historically, Bitcoin has reacted strongly to changes in the Fed’s policy outlook. Lower interest rates typically fuel a rally in risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Analysts point out that a more accommodative stance could propel Bitcoin past its 200-day moving average of $87,990.

This move will set the stage for a push toward the key $90,000 level. On-chain data also indicates that institutional demand remains strong, with major investors accumulating BTC ahead of the decision.

The XRP price surge is fueling speculation about a potential break past $3, while Ethereum ETFs are gaining traction, with staking emerging as a key catalyst for ETH’s next rally.

While these cryptos capitalize on bullish momentum, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making its biggest moves, nearing the end of its record-breaking presale. With $205.5 million raised and 18.8 billion BDAG sold, the network is now preparing for its Mainnet launch and 10 CEX listings this year. Given BlockDAG’s ongoing growth and upcoming milestones, forecasts place BDAG at $1 in 2025, making it one of the best long term cryptos to buy right now.

XRP Price Surges 7%: Can It Break the $3 Barrier Next?

The recent XRP price surge has caught the market’s attention, climbing 7% to $2.25 and sparking speculation about whether it can break the $3 barrier. After rebounding from the $2.10 support level, XRP is showing strength, with analysts closely watching resistance at $2.40 and $2.60. A breakout beyond these levels could fuel further gains, making this XRP price surge one of the most significant in recent months.

While technical indicators flash some hurdles ahead, the renewed momentum is giving traders hope that this XRP price surge could push the altcoin beyond its previous highs, setting the stage for a potential long-term uptrend.

Ethereum ETF Interest Rises as Staking Becomes a Key Price Driver

Recent reports suggest that Ethereum’s staking system could have a bigger impact on its price than the upcoming Pectra upgrade. Staking is becoming a major factor in Ethereum’s value growth, potentially surpassing past technological improvements. As interest in Ethereum ETFs grows, the addition of staking rewards could attract more institutional investors, boosting both liquidity and market confidence.

Currently, Ethereum is trading around $1,860, with staking participation rates steadily increasing. This growing interest in staking, combined with the rise of Ethereum ETFs, positions ETH for a potential bullish run, making staking a pivotal factor in its future price dynamics.

BlockDAG Presale Hits $205.5M as Mainnet & CEX Listings Approach

A crypto presale isn’t just about raising funds, it’s about building momentum before a project enters the open market. BlockDAG’s presale momentum has garnered over $205.5 million, selling more than 18.8 billion BDAG coins, making it one of the most successful presales in the industry. With demand surging and BDAG’s price rising from $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0248 in the current Batch 27, the project is quickly approaching its $600 million target. But what’s next for BDAG?

BlockDAG’s next phase is all about utility and expansion. The network’s Mainnet launch is set for 2025, marking a critical moment where BDAG will transition from presale success to full-scale blockchain adoption. Meanwhile, 10 major upcoming centralized exchange (CEX) listings are lined up to expand liquidity and accessibility, allowing global traders to engage with BDAG on a much larger scale.

BlockDAG’s strategic partnerships are further fueling its ecosystem and growing developer base. Through its collaboration with HackerEarth, BlockDAG is driving massive ecosystem expansion, with over 200 dApps currently in development. From DeFi applications to NFTs and Web3 solutions, the platform is shaping up to be a key player in blockchain innovation. This growing ecosystem isn’t just expanding BlockDAG’s utility—it’s also fueling its market momentum, as increasing adoption and development drive stronger demand for BDAG coins.

With each batch, BDAG’s price steadily climbs, reinforcing its trajectory toward the anticipated $1 valuation for 2025. As the presale nears its final phases, the available supply of BDAG coins is rapidly dwindling, making early entries increasingly scarce. Early BDAG adopters have already gained 2,380% ROI, while those joining the presale before Batch 27 sells out could see 3,932% ROI once the $1 price target is reached.

In a Nutshell

A recent 7% XRP price surge has reignited debate over a potential push beyond $3, with resistance at $2.40 and $2.60 under scrutiny. At the same time, interest in Ethereum ETFs is rising as staking becomes a key driver of its price growth. With market dynamics in flux, both assets are under close observation as analysts assess their next significant moves.

Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s presale momentum continues to accelerate, with over $205.5M raised and 18.8 billion BDAG sold. Upcoming CEX listings and the 2025 Mainnet launch could potentially drive BDAG’s price to $1, bringing Batch 27 holders a massive 3932% ROI. As prices continue climbing with each batch, BlockDAG is proving to be the best long term crypto, making early entry increasingly critical.

On the other hand, PancakeSwap (CAKE) has encountered a downturn, with its value slipping amid reduced trading activity.

As the presale for MUTM accelerates, it is becoming evident that structured DeFi solutions are attracting substantial attention. While PancakeSwap grapples with short-term volatility, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a formidable contender in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, offering both growth potential and lasting utility.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Strong Presale Demand and Utility-Driven Growth

Mutuum Finance has seen a surge in investor enthusiasm, with its presale surpassing 300 million tokens sold and total funds raised exceeding $4.1 million. At a current price of $0.02, the token is set for its next increase, further fueling demand. Each phase of the presale is selling out faster, prompting more investors to secure their holdings before the next price adjustment.

What sets Mutuum Finance apart from many presale projects is its real-world DeFi use case. Unlike speculative tokens that launch with hype but limited functionality, MUTM is backed by a structured lending and borrowing ecosystem. This ensures sustained demand for the token, with a tangible financial framework supporting its growth.

Enhancing its credibility, Mutuum Finance is also undergoing a security audit by CertiK. This will reinforce trust in the platform’s smart contract reliability, providing investors with added confidence in its security and transparency.



PancakeSwap (CAKE): Declining Performance and Investor Caution

While Mutuum Finance continues to gain momentum, PancakeSwap (CAKE) has experienced a notable decline. Over the past 24 hours, CAKE’s price has dropped by more than 10%, accompanied by a nearly 25% decrease in trading volume. This suggests a shift in investor sentiment as liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) faces short-term pressure.

Despite being one of the largest DEX platforms, PancakeSwap is facing growing competition in the DeFi sector. With more advanced lending protocols like Mutuum Finance emerging, investors are increasingly looking for platforms that provide innovative yield-earning opportunities beyond traditional DEX swaps and staking rewards.

The Utility and Sustainability of MUTM

Mutuum Finance is designed to sustain consistent demand for its token through its dual lending model, featuring both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms. This allows users to earn passive income while also accessing liquidity without the need to sell their assets.

A key innovation within Mutuum Finance is its overcollateralized stablecoin, ensuring robust liquidity without requiring a dedicated asset pool. Users mint stablecoins by locking excess collateral, helping to maintain a stable supply and avoid sudden de-pegging issues.

Moreover, the platform incorporates a buy-and-distribute mechanism to reinforce long-term token demand. A portion of protocol fees is allocated to repurchasing MUTM from the open market, effectively reducing selling pressure while distributing these tokens to mtTOKEN holders. This creates an ongoing demand cycle that rewards long-term investors and sustains ecosystem growth.

The Shift Toward Mutuum Finance

As PancakeSwap faces declining engagement, many investors are shifting their focus toward Mutuum Finance. The combination of an active DeFi ecosystem, structured financial model, and strong presale momentum positions MUTM as a highly attractive investment opportunity. Unlike older DeFi models that rely on traditional DEX mechanics, Mutuum Finance is built for sustained growth and long-term adoption.

With its lending protocol, stablecoin integration, and built-in buy pressure mechanisms, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a top contender in the evolving DeFi landscape. As the market continues to mature, projects with solid use cases and increasing adoption are expected to outperform those that rely on outdated models.

https://blockonomi.com,"Shiba Inu Whales Are Stacking Up IntelMarkets (INTL) Before 27,900% Rally",https://blockonomi.com/shiba-inu-whales-are-stacking-up-intelmarkets-intl-before-27900-rally/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 14:00:50 GMT","The recent technical factors in the Shiba Inu (SHIB) network hint at a potential reversal that could reinstate its trading value and reignite investor confidence. On the flip side, IntelMarkets (INTL) dominates the entire memecoin sector with its mind-blowing presale rush and jaw-dropping performance metrics hinting at a potential 27,900% rally before the next cycle.

Shiba Inu Price Moves to $0.000014: SHIB Holders Turn Bullish

Dog-themed cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) is eyeing a push toward $0.000014, but a 236 billion SHIB supply could determine its next major move. According to IntoTheBlock data, 236.46 billion SHIB are currently held at $0.000014 by 3,780 addresses. A breach of this minor resistance would allow SHIB to reach $0.000014 and aim for a potential breakout.

The on-chain data shows a similar accumulation of 548.64 trillion SHIB supply held by 162,610 addresses in the range of $0.000014 and $0.000019, with a breach hinting at major gains for the Shiba Inu price. On the other hand, failure to breach the $0.000014 level could result in consolidation or a minor correction for SHIB before another rally attempt.

Currently, all eyes are on the Shiba Inu price as it moves closer to this critical zone. In the event of a decline, support is anticipated at $0.0000108, which halted the Shiba Inu price fall on March 11. At the time of writing, SHIB was up 0.7% in the last 24 hours to $0.00001285 and up 6% weekly. Memecoin investors are currently cautious amid the turbulent Shiba Inu price trend.

Technical Factors Hint at a Potential Shiba Inu Price Recovery

In a recent tweet, IntoTheBlock reported that the combined memecoin market cap had returned to levels seen in the third quarter of last year and highlighted key on-chain indicators to watch for a shift. For the past two days, the Shiba Inu price has oscillated in a tight range between $0.00001227 and $0.000013 as traders await the market’s next move.

These include the number of traders, with short-term traders often signaling new retail engagement. While most memecoins still show a downward trend in this metric, a potential Shiba Inu price reversal could mark a key turning point for the altcoin. Second are transaction volumes, which reflect usage growth, even if not necessarily driven by new users.

SHIB Whales Stack Up IntelMarkets Before 27,900% Rally

IntelMarkets (INTL) recently received 10,000 weekly signups after most SHIB investors moved their capital into this emerging AI entrant. Most memecoin holders are prioritizing IntelMarkets over other memecoin projects because this platform offers AI-powered insights and holistic trading signals with its Intelli-M capability. That way, traders never miss a market-moving event.

Shiba Inu investors are flocking to IntelMarkets for its most advanced tools, models, and data designed for traders, analysts, and developers. Powered by its proprietary AI blockchain, the platform offers advanced AI models that comprise curated datasets, proprietary data streams, and on-chain analytics to keep investors ahead of the curve in the shifting market dynamics.

IntelMarkets Amid Top Viral AI Coins To Buy This Cycle

The next-generation layer-1 protocol by IntelMarkets (INTL) allows users to tap into a vast library of AI trading agents, market predictors, and data analysis models. INTL holders can build their own, refine existing ones, or deploy AI-powered strategies instantly. In a nutshell, IntelMarkets is proving to be a game-changer for traders just starting out.

While the Shiba Inu price shows signs of recovery after a prolonged bearish sentiment in the network, IntelMarkets (INTL) is gaining traction among memecoin holders. Particularly, memecoin holders are shifting to IntelMarkets for its plug-and-play AI agents that let traders get ahead of the crypto market to secure high-ticket profits and claim lucrative opportunities.

https://blockonomi.com,"Solana Price Approaches The Border Of Huge Breakout, Will Coldware Still Hold The POS Title?",https://blockonomi.com/solana-price-approaches-the-border-of-huge-breakout-will-coldware-still-hold-the-pos-title/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 12:26:56 GMT","The cryptocurrency market is heating up as Solana (SOL) nears a major breakout, sparking discussions about its future. With a price consolidation around the $125 mark, many are wondering if Solana will break its resistance levels and lead the next bull rally. However, amidst this excitement, a newcomer—Coldware (COLD)—is quietly building momentum, and investors are increasingly turning their attention to this Web3 powerhouse.

Coldware’s Approach to Addressing Solana’s Limitations

Unlike Solana, Coldware (COLD) is integrating blockchain technology with Internet of Things (IoT) solutions in a decentralized manner. This fusion of IoT and Web3 is what sets Coldware apart from existing Layer-1 competitors like Solana (SOL). While Solana has made strides in scalability, it has struggled to maintain a seamless, fault-tolerant infrastructure for high-demand, real-world applications.

Coldware (COLD) uses Layer-2 solutions, designed to offload transactional burdens from the main network, making Coldware capable of handling the heavy throughput demands of IoT applications. This architecture ensures that Coldware (COLD) maintains a high level of security, efficiency, and scalability that Solana (SOL) has yet to achieve consistently.

Why Coldware (COLD) Could Outperform Solana in the Long Run

While Solana remains a major competitor in the blockchain space, Coldware (COLD) is focused on real-world adoption, integrating blockchain with everyday technology like IoT devices. As the IoT market is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself as a solution to the critical needs of low-cost, high-efficiency IoT transactions.

The Coldware (COLD) platform supports an advanced decentralized network for IoT, offering greater security, scalability, and cost efficiency compared to Solana’s approach. By utilizing a Layer-2 system for rapid transactions and reduced congestion, Coldware holds the potential to redefine the future of IoT-enabled Web3 technology.

Furthermore, Coldware (COLD) stands out because of its unique ability to handle a wider array of decentralized applications (dApps) and real-world use cases in industries beyond finance. While Solana (SOL) may excel in DeFi applications, Coldware (COLD) can scale efficiently across industries like smart homes, healthcare, and logistics.

Solana’s Path to Potential Breakout

Over the past week, Solana (SOL) has faced fluctuating market conditions. The $136 highs from early in the week gave way to a more stable range of around $125. Despite setbacks, the network has seen increased activity, and many are forecasting a breakout in the coming weeks. However, the network’s growing transaction volumes are beginning to hit its limits, leading to delays and frustrations that continue to plague the network’s scalability.

Solana’s Layer-1 solution has been lauded for its speed and low-cost transactions, making it a favorite among developers and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. But as the ecosystem expands, Solana has faced significant network downtimes and congestion, which have put the future of its performance in question.

In light of these struggles, Coldware (COLD)—a competitor with a growing presence in the Web3 space—is positioning itself to address the very issues Solana continues to face: scalability, transaction fees, and network congestion.

Looking Ahead: Solana’s Role vs. Coldware’s Growth

As Solana (SOL) approaches key resistance levels in its current cycle, the market is eagerly anticipating whether it will break through or face another setback. Meanwhile, Coldware (COLD) is quietly but steadily gaining attention as it nears Day 3 before the official launch of its site. The growing Web3 landscape is becoming more competitive, and Coldware’s unique approach to integrating IoT with blockchain could see it taking the lead in this new frontier.

While Solana may continue to maintain its position in the blockchain market, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a future-ready solution capable of surpassing Solana in providing a fully decentralized and scalable network for real-world applications.

Conclusion: The Future of Blockchain and Web3 Technology

The race to scalability, security, and efficiency in the Web3 space is heating up. While Solana (SOL) continues to improve its system, it still faces major limitations in terms of network congestion and sustainability. On the other hand, Coldware (COLD) has positioned itself to address these challenges, offering a unique blockchain-IoT solution that could redefine the Web3 ecosystem.

As Solana (SOL) faces its next hurdle in the market, Coldware (COLD) could very well be the next big thing in blockchain, capable of delivering the scalability and efficiency that Solana promises but has yet to fully deliver.

https://blockonomi.com,Pi Network (PI) Price: Token Drops Below $1 as Upcoming Unlocks Loom,https://blockonomi.com/pi-network-pi-price-token-drops-below-1-as-upcoming-unlocks-loom/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 09:06:18 GMT","TLDR

Pi Network price has dropped below $1, down 6.3% to around $0.94

Upcoming token unlocks of 97.65 million Pi over 30 days could add more selling pressure

Expert suggests burning 60-100 million Pi coins to help stabilize the price

Technical indicators show a potential bullish breakout with a falling wedge pattern forming

Pi Network faces challenges with major exchange listings due to transparency concerns

Pi Network’s cryptocurrency has been experiencing steady decline in recent weeks, with the price dropping below the important $1 mark. The digital asset is currently trading at $0.94, representing a 6.3% drop in the last 24 hours. This decline places Pi Coin at more than 66% below its all-time high of around $3 reached earlier this year.

The Pi cryptocurrency’s trading volume has increased by 12% to $284.36 million despite the price drop. This higher trading activity shows that investors remain interested in the token even as its value falls.

Market watchers point to several factors behind the recent price weakness. The lack of confirmation about a potential Binance listing has disappointed many investors who had hoped for wider exchange support. The absence of major announcements from the Pi Core Team has also hurt market sentiment.

A major concern for Pi holders is the upcoming token unlocks. Data shows that nearly 97.65 million Pi tokens worth approximately $93 million at current prices will be released into circulation over the next 30 days. The daily average unlock rate stands at 3.25 million tokens.

April 3rd will see the largest single-day unlock with 6.8 million Pi coins entering the market. Looking further ahead, PiScan data reveals that 115.57 million tokens will be unlocked in April, followed by 182 million in May and 222 million in June.

These massive unlocks could put more downward pressure on Pi Network’s price. However, crypto expert Dr. Altcoin believes there might be a solution to this problem.

Dr. Altcoin suggested on X (formerly Twitter) that the Pi Core Team should consider burning between 60-100 million Pi coins in the coming days. This reduction in supply could help offset the impact of newly unlocked tokens and potentially drive the price back to the $1 mark.

The CEXs have been flooded with unlocked Pi coins, and the PTC will need to burn another 60 to 100 million coins from the circulating supply in the coming days in order to bring Pi back to $1. I am now more confident that Pi is going to return to $1 soon. DYOR! pic.twitter.com/PooqZX8SsY — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) March 24, 2025

The total circulating supply of Pi currency was recently reduced to 6.77 billion following the removal of 10 million coins. While some see this as a positive move to maintain value, others have raised concerns about potential market manipulation.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis provides some hope for Pi investors. The cryptocurrency has formed a falling wedge pattern, which often signals a bullish reversal. Both the MACD indicator and the Percentage Price Oscillator show bullish divergence, suggesting that upward momentum may be building.

If these technical signals prove accurate, Pi Network price could experience a strong breakout in the near future. Some analysts believe a successful breakout could eventually push the price back toward its all-time high of around $3.

Pi Network’s challenges extend beyond price action. Transparency issues around the project’s tokenomics have made major exchanges hesitant to list the coin. Concerns about the locking and burning mechanism of billions of Pi tokens have led to regulatory questions.

Some community members debate whether the delay in securing exchange listings stems from transparency issues or the Pi Core Team’s unwillingness to pay listing fees. Others point to Pi Network’s sell restrictions as potential barriers to wider exchange adoption.

On a more positive note, Pi Network recently announced a collaboration with PiDaoSwap aimed at enhancing transparency and governance within the ecosystem. This community-driven initiative could help improve confidence in the Pi Coin market.

🔥We are thrilled to announce that we have officially entered into a strategic partnership with @PiDaoSwap_ and have become a DAO member of PiDaoSwap. The PiDaoSwap project is not owned by any single individual – it is 100% community-driven, featuring 100% DAO governance, 100%… pic.twitter.com/MXEVaEXWXK — Pi News (@PiNewsMedia) March 21, 2025

For Pi to regain its upward momentum, several catalysts could prove helpful. A token burn announcement would likely boost investor confidence by addressing concerns about oversupply. Securing listings on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase would also significantly increase trading volume and visibility.

A broader recovery in the cryptocurrency market, particularly a strong Bitcoin rally, could lift Pi along with other altcoins. Until then, investors are closely watching the $1 price level as a key psychological barrier for Pi Network’s future performance.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,Top Solana (SOL) Wallets Rotate Into Ripple (XRP) and Rexas Finance (RXS) Before the Next Market Surge,https://blockonomi.com/top-solana-sol-wallets-rotate-into-ripple-xrp-and-rexas-finance-rxs-before-the-next-market-surge/,"Mon, 24 Mar 2025 11:53:37 GMT","The cryptocurrency market is expected to rebound again, so investors are repositioning to maximize gains. In anticipation of the following market spike, top Solana (SOL) wallets are investing in Ripple (XRP) and Rexas Finance (RXS). With this shift, XRP’s cross-border payment solutions and RXS’s breakthrough real-world asset (RWA) tokenization approach are gaining trust. These two projects are strategic investments with high appreciation potential in the quickly changing crypto ecosystem.

Solana Holders Switching to XRP and RXS: Why?

Solana, famed for its fast transactions and minimal costs, has remained popular in crypto. SOL whales diversify into XRP and RXS because of their tremendous growth potential as institutional attention moves to utility-driven assets. Growth in relationships and legal clarity keep Ripple (XRP) at the top of global finance. While Rexas Finance (RXS) pioneered RWA tokenization, real estate, commodities, and collectibles became tradeable digital assets for frictionless, decentralized investing.

XRP and RXS Becoming Top Picks

Ripple (XRP): Global Payments Leader

Ripple (XRP) has shown resiliency, especially since its partial SEC legal triumph. With institutional adoption and partnerships with global financial institutions, XRP can benefit from the growing demand for fast cross-border payments.

Reasons for XRP’s Rise

Regulatory Clarity: Ripple’s legal battles have helped financial institutions trust XRP for transactions.

XRP Accumulation: Payment and service institutions increasingly hold XRP, driving further institutional interest.

On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service: Ripple optimizes the cost and efficiency of cross-border transactions through its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service.

Cooperation: Large scale central banking and financial institutions validate and employ XRP, thus increasing its value.

Due to its discount from its prior highs, SOL investors are carefully accumulating XRP expecting a price breakout.

Rexas Finance (RXS): Asset Tokenization Future

Rexas Finance revolutionizes RWA tokenization to redefine blockchain investment. Rexas Finance turns financial assets into liquid, tradeable tokens by allowing ownership of fractional real estate, commodities, and intellectual property. This innovation removes investment obstacles, expanding market involvement.

Massive Presale Success

Investor anticipation is high for Rexas Finance’s 12th and final presale. Highlights include:

Presale price increase: 600% from $0.03 to $0.20 in Stage 1.

Over $47.1 million raised, proving market demand.

RXS token sales reached 455.5 million, indicating investor confidence.

The exchange launched at $0.25 per token on June 19, 2025, setting the stage for significant post-listing appreciation. Analysts predict over 40,000% increases, making it one of the most valuable forthcoming listings.

Innovative Features Promote RXS Adoption

Rexas Token Builder lets non-coders construct digital assets.

Instant tokenization over Telegram and Discord using Rexas QuickMint Bot .

Property ownership is easier with Rexas Estate fractional real estate investments.

Rexas AI Shield eliminates smart contract vulnerabilities.

Deflationary Tokenomics ensure long—term stability. The system limits presales, liquidity pools, and staking to 1 billion RXS tokens.

Certik Audit verifies the security of Rexas Finance’s smart contract to build investor trust.

Major Listings — RXS will launch on three top 10 crypto exchanges, increasing liquidity and acceptance.

Community Growth and Market Excitement

In a $1 million competition, Rexas Finance gave the top 20 entrants $50,000 in RXS tokens. With over 1.6 million entries, the community is growing quickly, preparing for market launch. RXS demand is projected to soar after listing as investors realize its potential.

Why XRP and RXS Are Market Surge Favorites

Both XRP and RXS have benefits that make them excellent picks for the upcoming market rally:

XRP offers institutional-grade cross-border payment solutions, receiving regulatory certainty and widespread adoption.

RXS tokenizes assets, changing financial investments.

Both tokens have solid technical fundamentals and developing communities, improving their price appreciation potential.

As big Solana wallets switch to XRP and RXS, faith in these assets grows as bull run boosters grow.

A Final Thought

Strategic investors are preparing for another crypto market rise. The significant rotation from Solana (SOL) wallets to Ripple (XRP) and Rexas Finance (RXS) shows the trend toward assets with real-world utility and growth potential. XRP’s worldwide payments dominance and RXS’s RWA tokenization pioneership make them noteworthy picks. With XRP poised to profit from institutional adoption and RXS preparing for its exchange debut, these tokens might provide significant returns. Early investors in XRP and RXS might profit exponentially as the market gains speed, making them great candidates for the next crypto riches wave. XRP and RXS are top picks for excellent fundamentals, institutional interest, and growth potential.
