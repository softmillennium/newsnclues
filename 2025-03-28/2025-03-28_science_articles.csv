https://sciencenews.org,‘Woolly mice’ were just a start. De-extinction still faces many hurdles,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wooly-mice-transgenic-mammoth,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","Scientists working to unlock the secrets of de-extinction recently announced what they say is a turning point for the movement: the creation of transgenic mice with long, luxurious golden locks of tufted fur inspired by the coats of woolly mammoths.

They’re called Colossal woolly mice. And yes, they are cute to boot.

Transgenic mice — those that have had their genomes altered through genetic engineering — are not new. But what’s novel is the ability to engineer eight edits across seven genes and to do so simultaneously in one animal. The researchers also note that across three experiments, each of which used different combinations of edits, the method worked with high efficiency, resulting in living animals that presented the traits they were bred for.

In other words, the scientists have shown not only that they can make woolly mice, but also that they can do so reliably and repeatedly — a necessity for the project’s next steps.

“That’s been overlooked [in the immediate aftermath of the announcement] as far as how actually big of a deal that is in genetic engineering,” says Beth Shapiro, chief science officer at Colossal Biosciences in Dallas. She and her colleagues described the team’s findings in a paper posted March 4 at bioRxiv.org.

In all, the team created 32 woolly mice, each of which varied slightly in appearance, but reflected the traits the scientists predicted. Shapiro says there were no misfires or surprises in the lot. “Other than that they were so absurdly adorable,” she says.

But what do a few extra-furry mice have to do with bringing mammoths back from extinction? That part is a little more complicated and has led to misunderstandings since the findings were announced. For instance, the New York Post described the woolly mouse as a new species — it isn’t — and one post on X with millions of views stated that the scientists “spliced woolly mammoth genes into mice,” which is also not true.

“We did not want to take elephant genes and shove them into a mouse,” Shapiro says, “because that wouldn’t make any sense.”

So what is a woolly mouse, exactly?

To create the woolly mouse, scientists analyzed the genetic instructions, or genomes, of 121 mammoth and elephant samples to identify genes that may have given woolly mammoths some of their characteristic traits. These include longer, thicker, golden hair, as well as genes associated with lipid metabolism and fatty acid absorption for a life spent in the bitter cold.

“We can do a lot with the mammoth genomes we have. We can line them up on a computer and compare them to elephant genomes and ask where all the mammoths are the same as each other but different from their elephant cousins,” says Shapiro, who is also an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Using these hints about what makes a mammoth a mammoth, the scientists searched for similar traits in mice, either naturally occurring or achievable through genetic engineering. Mice are much easier to work with than elephants, of course. The tiny rodents require little space, breed quickly and have already been extensively studied with regards to their genetics. For instance, scientists have known since 1994 that if you turn off the FGF5 gene, mice will grow much longer hair than usual. Similarly, a gene known as Mc1r makes mice blond, while Frzd6 makes that hair whorly and frizzled.

The final step was transforming edited embryos into living, breathing, gloriously furred mice.

“Of course, mice are not elephants, which people have helpfully pointed out to us, as if we didn’t know that,” says Shapiro, referring to some common critiques her team has received.

This is why, she says, the woolly mice are just one part of the de-extinction goal. Colossal Biosciences, founded in 2021, has also been experimenting directly with Asian elephant cells, because that species is most closely related to extinct woolly mammoths.

Another arm of research focuses on the artificial reproductive techniques necessary to implant a genetically modified elephant embryo into a living elephant and then bring that animal to term. Similarly, the scientists are also working on de-extinction projects for the dodo and a wolflike marsupial known as the thylacine.

“All of this work is happening simultaneously,” Shapiro says.

We can’t just clone woolly mammoths

Jacquelyn Gill, an ice age ecologist at the University of Maine in Orono, does not hide her excitement about the idea of seeing a woolly mammoth in person one day.

“I understand why someone would be compelled to see a mammoth,” Gill says. “I’ve never seen my study system in person, right? It only exists in my mind’s eye, because I study a past that is gone.”

Nor does she reject the idea of de-extinction outright. In fact, Gill says, “the science of de-extinction is exciting and has broad applications.”

However, she is skeptical that what Colossal Biosciences is pursuing will qualify as bringing a woolly mammoth back from the dead.

For starters, despite the discovery of many well-preserved mammoth remains in permafrost —some complete with fur, muscles and skin — thousands of years buried in ice have destroyed every cell. This degradation means researchers cannot clone a mammoth, as has already been achieved in sheep.

“That’s a whole pathway to cloning that is cut off from us,” Gill says.

While gene editing may allow altering an Asian elephant in ways that superficially resemble a woolly mammoth, any attempt to do so will probably miss innumerable genetic flourishes that made woolly mammoths a unique species.

“A mammoth is not an elephant in a fur coat,” says Tori Herridge, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sheffield in England.

Skepticism about bringing back woolly mammoths abounds

While Herridge finds the candidate genes for mammoth fur types and cold adaptation “really exciting and interesting,” she cautions that we still don’t know “what makes a mammoth a mammoth.”

“We all know that genes are complicated,” Herridge says. “One gene can affect many things, and many genes can act in concert.” Furthermore, she says, researchers don’t yet know if the genes used to dictate hair length, texture or color in the woolly mice will produce the same effects in Asian elephants.

Some troubleshooting can be done in the lab, Shapiro says. For instance, the team is already growing elephant cells in cultures and then testing how those cells respond to things like changes in gene expression. This allows Colossal to learn more about which genes to target without having to grow or experiment on a whole elephant.

The team has also already created elephant pluripotent stem cells, which could potentially be used to create any kind of cell — a crucial step toward assisted reproduction and the ultimate goal of implanting a transgenic elephant embryo into a living host.

Complicating this step is the fact that Asian elephant gestation can last up to about 22 months, meaning the process to create just one transgenic elephant will take significantly longer than that of woolly mice, which are pregnant for just 18 to 21 days. Moreover, Asian elephants are classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which will probably restrict how this process unfolds.

Even assuming that all of this will one day be possible, and in numbers sufficient to create a viable woolly mammoth–like herd, other questions remain. For instance, scientists have shown that modern-day elephants are complex animals with established social and cultural knowledge that gets passed down through generations.

“You can’t teach a transgenic elephant how to be a woolly mammoth,” Gill says.

And the habitat that mammoths once roamed has changed quite a bit since the Pleistocene epoch, which ended 11,700 years ago.

Back then, the tundra would have been covered in life, Gill says, much like today’s Serengeti. Scientists call this biome, once the most widespread on earth, the mammoth steppe. But modern day ecosystems in those northerly regions are less productive and diverse, Gill says. Interestingly, this may have occurred because mammoths were keystone species that changed their environment. The mammoths made the mammoth steppe, in other words. And when mammoths disappeared, the ecosystem disappeared with them.

But if mammoths made an ecosystem once, perhaps they could do it again. De-extincted mammoths could, in theory, reengineer an ecosystem in ways beneficial to them, Gill says. And that theoretical capability is key to one of Colossal Bioscience’s goals: Bring back herds of mammoths that will stamp down permafrost and help keep carbon stored in the ground, protecting against further climate change.

“The problem is we don’t actually know if that’s possible,” Gill says.

Woolly mammoth calves on the ground by 2028?

For her part, Shapiro acknowledges the legitimate criticisms of Colossal Biosciences’ goals but remains optimistic about the future. In fact, one of the company’s other projects might succeed first: Bringing back the dodo.

After all, while bird genetics present their own litany of challenges, there’s a lot to be said for an animal that requires an egg rather than a surrogate mother, she quips.

And while Colossal Biosciences’ founder, Ben Lamm, has stated that he wants to see woolly mammoth calves on the ground by 2028, Shapiro has always stressed that genetics is just one part of the equation.

“We will have elephant cells that are edited and ready to go in early ’27, which is what we would need to have something on the ground in 2028,” Shapiro says. “But then there’s a lot of hard biology that still hasn’t been solved that needs to be solved.”",sciencenews
https://sciencenews.org,3 things to know about the deadly Myanmar earthquake,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/myanmar-earthquake-march-2025,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 15:48:42 GMT","A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake rocked central Myanmar on March 28 at about 12:50 p.m. local time, leaving at least 144 people confirmed dead so far and triggering widespread damage across both Myanmar and Thailand. Buildings collapsed, roads broke and at least one dam and a bridge crumbled. A magnitude 6.4 aftershock followed just 10 minutes later.

With both countries declared disaster areas, international aid workers are scrambling to prepare supplies and assess the death toll and damages. Marie Manrique, Myanmar program coordinator for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told reporters March 28 that the organization is particularly concerned about damages to public infrastructure, including large-scale dams.

An earthquake’s devastation is the result not only of its magnitude, but also its location and depth: Shallow quakes, even if they’re less powerful, can cause intense shaking at the ground surface, posing threats to infrastructure in populated areas. This quake had a trifecta of dangers: It was powerful; shallow, with the epicenter at just 10 kilometers depth; and in a heavily populated region with vulnerable buildings and other structures.

Here are three things to know about how and why this earthquake occurred.

It was a strike-slip earthquake.

This earthquake was probably the result of sideways, or strike-slip, movement along the Sagaing Fault, a large fault that runs north to south through central Myanmar, according to the U.S. Geological Survey’s Earthquake Hazards Program.

Strike-slip earthquakes occur when two blocks of tectonic crust are trying to slide sideways past each other; the blocks of crust may briefly lock due to the friction, then wrench free, releasing a burst of seismic energy through the ground.

The Sagaing Fault is part of a complex and hazardous plate boundary.

The fault marks the collision between the India tectonic plate, which includes the Indian subcontinent and part of the Indian Ocean, and the Sunda Plate, a smaller bit of crust that includes parts of Southeast Asia, including the Malaysia Peninsula.

As the India Plate slides northward, it grinds sideways against the Sunda plate to the east, occasionally generating powerful quakes. The Sagaing Fault region itself is rife with seismic hazards, and many large strike-slip quakes have occurred in the area over the last century, including a magnitude 7.0 in 1990 and a magnitude 7.9 in 1912, according to the USGS. From 1930 to 1956, there were six quakes greater than magnitude 7 on the Sagaing Fault itself that killed hundreds.

The India Plate’s northward drive has also put it on a collision course with the Eurasian Plate. That ongoing clash continues to push up the Himalaya mountain range and the Tibetan Plateau. It has also caused some of the deadliest quakes in the Himalaya region, including the 2005 Kashmir quake that killed tens of thousands of people.

Liquefaction is a known hazard in the region.

Regions with thick layers of loose soil can be prone to liquefaction during quakes. That process is a deadly interaction between seismic waves and the sediment that temporarily causes the soil to behave like quicksand.

Earlier quakes in this region have triggered landslides and liquefaction that greatly added to the death toll of those past events — and may have contributed to this quake’s devastation, although it’s too soon to know the extent of the damages.",sciencenews
https://sciencenews.org,‘Star Wars’ holds clues to making speedier spacecraft in the real world,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-wars-spacecraft-speed-reality,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 09:00:00 GMT","Pilots in Star Wars enter a dimension, hyperspace, to travel between distant worlds. To merge onto this cosmic highway, ships are equipped with special engines called hyperdrives. With the push of a lever, the spacecraft zooms faster than the speed of light, traversing between star systems in just hours or days. Han Solo and his sidekick Chewbacca make the jump to hyperspace look easy (at least when the Millennium Falcon is in working order).

But Star Wars breaks the laws of physics to achieve such a feat. Off-screen, the technology to reach another star system doesn’t yet exist. However, emerging propulsion methods could brighten the future of interstellar travel.

Due to the nature of light and energy, it’s impossible to reach the speed of light, nearly 300,000 kilometers per second. It would take an infinite amount of energy. The fastest any human-made object has traveled is only about 0.06 percent of that speed. At that rate, it would take about 6,600 years to reach the nearest exoplanet, Proxima Centauri b, 4.24 light-years away.

A spacecraft traveling at one-tenth of the speed of light could shave the trip down to a quick 40 years. Future engineers could use nuclear power to achieve that, says Scott Bailey, an engineer at Virginia Tech. But developing that technology could take thousands of years.

Controlled fusion could help, says Cole Miller, an astronomer at the University of Maryland in College Park. Controlled fusion harnesses energy from combining atomic nuclei to create a steady supply of power. Researchers have been working on controlled fusion for about 70 years. But so far, these experiments have yet to produce more energy than they consume.

Not all vehicles in the Star Wars universe rely on hyperdrives; some“sun jammers” have huge sails thatcatch stellar winds — the constantstream of charged particles producedby stars — to move throughspace like a ship on the sea.

Recently, the nonprofit Planetary Society tested a similar concept. The crowdfunded LightSail 2 launched in 2019 and orbited Earth for about three years. Rather than relying on solar wind, though, the small craft’s solar sails used pressure from sunlight itself. Although light doesn’t have mass, it does have momentum. The solar sails intercepted sunlight with thin sheets made of reflective Mylar and other polymers. When speeding photons hit the sail, they bounced.

Using solar sails to propel a large spacecraft would be tough, Miller says. The thrust produced probably wouldn’t be strong enough to carry ships ferrying humans. Upscaling solar sails would offer unique benefits, however. Using sunlight would allow a spaceship to accelerate without fuel. And unlike objects on Earth, spacecraft aren’t slowed by air friction produced by an atmosphere. This would allow any spacecraft to continue gaining speed as long as it’s exposed to sunlight.

For now, spacefarers aren’t looking to travel to another star system. But even travel within the solar system, say, to Mars, could use a boost. To safely bring people to and from the Red Planet, some researchers are looking to ion engines. These thrusters create force by shooting charged atoms from the back of a spacecraft. Star Wars’ TIE Fighters, like the one flown by Darth Vader, navigate through space battles with them.

But real ion engines work best with straight paths, says Jarred Young, an engineer at the University of Maryland. “It’s essentially point-and-click propulsion.”

Ion engines aren’t as powerful as the chemical propellants in rockets, which create thrust by combusting fuel and oxygen-releasing substances called oxidizers. But chemical rockets burn for only a short time. Ion engines can last months or even years, possibly helping fuel trips to Mars, if engineers can design strong enough thrusters.

For now, reaching distant new worlds is only possible in fictional galaxies far, far away.",sciencenews

https://livescience.com,Mysterious artifacts from King Tut's tomb might have been used in 'awakening Osiris' ritual,https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-egyptians/mysterious-artifacts-from-king-tuts-tomb-might-have-been-used-in-awakening-osiris-ritual,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 20:44:45 GMT","An Egyptologist has found evidence that a rite known as the ""Awakening of Osiris"" was performed in Tutankhamun's burial chamber.

An Egyptologist believes he has identified evidence that a rite known as the ""Awakening of Osiris"" was performed in Tutankhamun's burial chamber.

According to Nicholas Brown , a postdoctoral associate in Egyptology at Yale University, this is the earliest evidence for the use of the rite on a pharaoh.

""The whole burial chamber seems to be set up to recreate a funerary rite known from later times called 'the Awakening of Osiris,'"" Brown, who described the findings in a paper published Feb. 22 in The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology , told Live Science in an email.

Osiris was an ancient Egyptian god of the underworld , who, according to mythology, was brought back to life after he was murdered by his brother Seth. At one point in the story, his son Horus waves a staff at Osiris and commands him to awaken.

The rite recreates this story in some ways. While reexamining excavation records of Tutankhamun's tomb, Brown noticed that four clay troughs and four staffs were found in Tutankhamun's burial chamber. These four troughs would have held libations, likely of water, that could have been poured on or near Tutankhamun's mummy, while the four staffs would have represented the staff used by Horus.

The water libations hold great symbolic value. In the Pyramid Texts , a series of funerary texts written onto the walls of some Egyptian pyramids, ""liquid libations are said to be fluid derived from the corpse of the deceased, or from the corpse of Osiris,"" Brown wrote in the journal article. ""These fluids are necessary in order to rejuvenate the decaying corpse and restore its life-giving fluid to the body.""

He also noted that water used for libations, retrieved from the Nile River, was known as the ""Eye of Horus"" and was ""a powerful symbol of regeneration and overcoming evil, including death,"" Brown wrote in the article.

The four troughs and four staffs would have represented the cardinal directions and would ""symbolically surround the deceased for protection,"" Brown said in the email.

Son of a heretic

Tutankhamun's father, the pharaoh Akhenaten, brought about a revolution that tried to focus Egyptian religion around the worship of the Aten, the sun disk. He even ordered an iconoclasm that saw the destruction of the names and images of other deities.

""Akhenaten shifted the country's religious beliefs to the monotheistic religion focused on the sun-disk, the Aten; this also affected the official afterlife beliefs focused on resurrection through Osiris, which was no longer permitted,"" Brown said in the email.

When Tutankhamun came to power, he undid this revolution, thus returning Egypt to its polytheistic religion. ""Tutankhamun and the officials acting on his behalf had the opportunity to adapt, alter, and change royal funerary practice and bring back Osiris into the picture,"" Brown said. The Awakening of Osiris ritual was one way to show that Osiris was back.

Paula Veiga , a doctoral student and researcher at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich who wasn't involved with Brown's paper but has studied and written extensively about Osiris, generally supported the findings. In addition to water, the troughs may have held other substances, such as ointments, she said.

An ancient galactic lighthouse is shining through the fog of the early universe, new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations reveal.

Researchers discovered bright ultraviolet (UV) light coming from an ancient, distant galaxy. The findings, published March 26 in the journal Nature , suggest that the universe's first stars modified their surroundings even earlier than expected.

Shortly after the Big Bang , the universe was a soup of protons, neutrons and electrons. As the universe cooled, the protons and neutrons combined to form positively charged hydrogen ions, which then attracted negatively charged electrons to create a fog of neutral hydrogen atoms. This fog absorbed light with short wavelengths, such as UV light, blocking it from reaching farther into the universe.

But as the first stars and galaxies formed, they emitted enough UV light to knock the electrons back off the hydrogen atoms, allowing UV light out once again. Though this ""Era of Reionization"" is thought to have ended about a billion years after the Big Bang, scientists still aren't sure exactly when the first stars formed — or when the Era of Reionization began.

The new findings could help narrow down that starting point. Using JWST, researchers observed an ancient galaxy known as JADES-GS-z13-1 . The galaxy is so far from Earth that we're observing it as it appeared just 330 million years after the Big Bang.

In the JWST data, the scientists spotted bright light at a specific wavelength known as the Lyman-alpha emission, which is produced by hydrogen. Though the light started out as ultraviolet, the universe's expansion over more than 13 billion years has stretched it out into the infrared region, making it visible to JWST's sensors.

For the Lyman-alpha emission to reach Earth today, JADES-GS-z13-1 must have ionized enough of the hydrogen gas around it to allow the UV light to escape — something scientists hadn't expected so early in the universe's development.

""GS-z13-1 is seen when the universe was only 330 million years old, yet it shows a surprisingly clear, telltale signature of Lyman-alpha emission that can only be seen once the surrounding fog has fully lifted,"" study co-author Roberto Maiolino , an astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge, said in a statement . ""This result was totally unexpected by theories of early galaxy formation and has caught astronomers by surprise.""

Researchers still don't know what produced the Lyman-alpha radiation in JADES-GS-z13-1. The light might come from extremely hot and massive early stars, or it might be produced by an early supermassive black hole.

""We really shouldn't have found a galaxy like this, given our understanding of the way the universe has evolved,"" study co-author Kevin Hainline , an astronomer at the University of Arizona, said in the statement. ""We could think of the early universe as shrouded with a thick fog that would make it exceedingly difficult to find even powerful lighthouses peeking through, yet here we see the beam of light from this galaxy piercing the veil.""

""This fascinating emission line has huge ramifications for how and when the universe reionized,"" Hainline concluded.",livescience

The shallow earthquake struck at 12:50 p.m. local time (2:20 a.m. EDT) at a depth of about 6.2 miles (10 kilometers), the USGS reported . Just 12 minutes later, a magnitude 6.7 earthquake at the same depth shook south of the first one, and later that day, nine smaller earthquakes, ranging from magnitude 4.4 to 4.9, also hit the region.

At least 144 people were killed in the earthquakes, and 732 were injured, Myanmar's military junta said, according to The Washington Post . A monastery and multiple buildings also collapsed in Myanmar. In Bangkok, at least 10 people died when a 33-story high-rise under construction fell down; Thai authorities also said 16 people were injured and 101 were missing, the Associated Press reported .

Although Bangkok was ""well removed from where the faulting was"" in Myanmar, ""it's a very big earthquake and it's not really surprising it would have been felt for that amount of distance,"" Gregory Beroza , a professor of geophysics at Stanford University, told Live Science.

The earthquakes struck at the Sagaing Fault, which runs north-south and spans nearly 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) through Myanmar toward the Andaman Sea. Earthquakes that occur on this fault are known strike-slip quakes, in which one block of land moves horizontally past a block of land on the other side of the fault, according to the USGS. This is a similar setup as the San Andreas Fault in California , which is also a strike-slip fault.

Myanmar, which is just south of the Himalayas, is a seismically active region and known for its big earthquakes, Ben van der Pluijm , a professor emeritus of geology at the University of Michigan, told Live Science.

""The reason for that is that the continent of India sits on the Indian Plate. And the Indian Plate has been moving northward for around 100 million years,"" van der Pluijm said. ""But around 40 million years ago or so, India connected with the Eurasian Plate and kept on traveling northwards into the Eurasian Plate."" Over millions of years, that collision helped create the Himalayas .

Even today, the Indian Plate is still moving northward, into the Eurasian plate. That motion ""is what accumulated the energy that gets released in earthquakes like today's earthquakes in Southeastern Asia,"" van der Pluijm said.

Today's magnitude 7.7 earthquake was so big that it wouldn't be surprising if the ground were displaced several meters horizontally, van der Pluijm added.

""This is a very big earthquake,"" he said. ""We don't have many of these.""

Because these earthquakes were so shallow, they could be compared to the magnitude 7.8 and 7.5 earthquakes that struck Turkey in 2023 and caused widespread death and damage, said Jeffrey Park , a professor of Earth and planetary sciences who specializes in earthquakes and Earth structure at Yale University.

""We should expect the same kind of damage report and also loss of life from this earthquake because it's a shallow earthquake that's in a heavily populated area of Burma,"" Park told Live Science.

Since 1900, the region has had six other magnitude 7 or greater big strike-slip earthquakes within about 155 miles (250 km) of today's earthquake, according to the USGS. The most recent one, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in January 1990, caused 32 buildings to collapse. An even bigger one — a magnitude 7.9 — shook south of today's earthquake epicenter in February 1912.",livescience

And yet her durable carapace, legs and head are missing — lost to decay over 440 million years ago.""

The researchers found the fossils in the Soom Shale, a site known for producing fossils with well-preserved soft tissues, more than 20 years ago. They had hoped to find additional specimens, but fossils of the species turned out to be quite rare. The silt, clay, and mud in which Sue was preserved were deposited on an ancient seafloor, beneath an ocean low in oxygen but high in dissolved, acidic hydrogen sulfide — suggesting that K. susanae may have been adapted for a low-oxygen environment.

Sue dates back to the Late Ordovician mass extinction (443 million years ago), when cold temperatures and glacier advancement eliminated nearly 85% of marine species.

Researchers are still working to understand how soft tissues in fossils like K. susanae are preserved in the Soom Shale. Clay minerals may have played a role, as could calcium phosphate, a compound commonly found in fossilized muscles. On the other hand, the shells and exoskeletons of species preserved in Soom Shale likely dissolved in the acidic ocean.

Because the K. susanae specimen was fossilized inside out, scientists still aren't sure of the species' evolutionary history or how it compares to other fossils from the same time period.

""We are now sure she was a primitive marine arthropod, but her precise evolutionary relationships remain frustratingly elusive,"" Gabbott said in the statement. The fossil's segmented trunk suggests it had limbs of some kind — but comparing Sue to known fossil species would require a sample with part of the exoskeleton preserved.

Recent quarrying activity has buried the site where Gabbott and her colleagues found Sue, so it's unlikely they'll find other examples of the same species with intact legs or a head, the team said.

""I'd always hoped to find new specimens, but it seems after 25 years of searching this fossil is vanishingly rare — so I can hang on no longer,"" Gabbott said. ""Especially as recently my mum said to me, 'Sarah, if you are going to name this fossil after me, you'd better get on and do it before I am in the ground and fossilized myself'.""

Gabbott joked that she named the fossil after her mom because she's a ""well-preserved specimen."" But the true reason, she said, is that ""my mum always said I should follow a career that makes me happy — whatever that may be. For me that is digging rocks, finding fossils and then trying to figure out how they lived what they tell us about ancient life and evolution on Earth.""",livescience

In an update on March 28 , the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) shared an image of the restless volcano taken on March 26, revealing steam and gas pouring from both the summit and a vent on the northern flank.

""Robust steaming was observed from the summit yesterday due to favorable atmospheric and viewing conditions,"" AVO representatives wrote in the update. ""No detectable change in earthquake activity or gas emissions accompanied the steam emissions.""

The volcano has been showing signs of unrest over the last year, with earthquakes ramping up significantly in recent months. Scientists monitoring it now think an explosive eruption is likely .

""The increase in gas emissions confirms that new magma has intruded into the Earth’s crust beneath the volcano and indicates that an eruption is likely, but not certain, to occur within the next few weeks or months,"" AVO representatives wrote in a statement on March 11.

Mount Spurr, located around 80 miles (128 kilometers) west of Anchorage, is the highest volcano in the Aleutian Range, standing at 11,070 feet (3,374 meters) tall. The volcano consists of a central summit and a prominent side vent known as Crater Peak, located 2 miles (3.5 km) south of the summit, which has been the site of most of its historical eruptions, notably in 1953 and 1992.

AVO representatives said that the alert level for the volcano may be raised to an orange/watch or even a red/warning in the coming weeks if further signs of an eruption appear. ""This would include a change in the rate and character of earthquakes, onset of sustained seismic tremor, further increased gas emissions, changes in surface deformation, and melting of snow and ice,"" representatives wrote in a statement following a flight over the volcano on March 11.

In the event of an eruption, the biggest hazards would be ash clouds that may affect aviation, ashfall, pyroclastic flows, and lahars, which are fast-moving, destructive mudflows that occur on the slopes of volcanoes.

In a Facebook post on March 19, the AVO advised Alaskan residents on how to stay safe in the event of an eruption. ""The major hazards to Alaska residents from Spurr would be from ash risk to aviation and possible ashfall. The location, duration, and timing of the impacts would depend on the size and duration of the eruption as well as weather conditions during and afterwards,"" representatives wrote.

Those concerned about breathing in the airborne ash are advised to stay indoors, or wear a mask when venturing outside.

""The other hazards from a Mount Spurr eruption would only affect the areas immediately surrounding the volcano. While there are no residents in the identified hazard areas for pyroclastic flows and lahars, people do visit the area for recreational or subsistence purposes,"" representatives wrote.",livescience

Sakhawat Ali, a gamekeeper at the Central Karakoram National Park in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan, spotted the elusive animals on March 13 in a remote village called Hushe after two weeks of tracking their pugmarks [pawprints].

""Spotting four snow leopards is a great joy, as it indicates that the snow leopard population is increasing,"" Ali told Live Science.

Snow leopards (Panthera uncia) are an elusive species of big cat that can be found in mountainous areas across 12 countries in Central and Eastern Asia, and sightings are exceedingly rare. Their white coats render them almost invisible against the snowy mountains they call home, and more than 70% of their habitat remains unexplored, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).

Since late February, Ali said he had been noticing snow leopard pugmarks around the village. ""While I was on the roof of my house, I used binoculars to observe the mountains and spotted a female snow leopard along with her four cubs,"" he said. ""I quickly moved closer and filmed them from a distance of about 250 meters [820 feet].""

""In the village [of Hushe] we are used to seeing snow leopards, but nobody, not even the elders that I spoke to, have ever seen four snow leopards in one go,"" Ali told CNN .

Female snow leopards typically have between one and five cubs with each litter, according to WWF. At three months old, the cubs begin to follow their mother out of their dens to learn how to hunt in their environment. However, they stay with their mothers until they are almost 2-years-old, according to San Diego Zoo .

The big cats are considered vulnerable to extinction, with only 4,000 to 6,000 individuals left worldwide, according to WWF estimates.

The ""woolly devil,"" as researchers have named it, is in the sunflower family and also represents a new genus.

This is the first time in nearly 50 years that a new plant genus has been described in a U.S. national park, since the discovery of the July gold shrub (Dedeckera eurekensis) in Death Valley National Park in 1976, according to a statement from the California Academy of Sciences.

The new discovery suggests that researchers are far from documenting all of the plant diversity of the Chihuahuan Desert, which covers parts of Mexico and the southwestern U.S.

""While many assume that the plants and animals within our country's national parks have probably been documented by now, scientists still make surprising new discoveries in these iconic protected landscapes,"" Isaac Lichter Marck , a botanist at the California Academy of Sciences and co-author of research describing the new species, said in the statement.

Discovering the woolly devil

In March 2024, the park volunteer, Deb Manley, shared photos of the flowers — which measured 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 centimeters) across and were poking out from between desert rocks — to the citizen science platform iNaturalist, where an international community of botanists tried to identify the plant.

Manley and a team of botanists and biologists studied the flower's characteristics and conducted genetic analyses, comparing its DNA with those of species from herbaria at Sul Ross State University in Texas and the California Academy of Sciences. They confirmed the plant as both a new species and a new genus, and identified it as a member of the sunflower family, according to the research, which was published Feb. 18 in the journal PhytoKeys .

The researchers chose the scientific name Ovicula biradiata. In Latin ""ovis"" comes from ""sheep"" and honors the desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni), an iconic and threatened desert animal. The plant has white and woolly leaves, with small, curved, red and white flowers that resemble horns. The flowers were found near a part of the park called Devil's Den, leading the team to name the species the ""woolly devil.""

The Chihuahuan Desert is North America's largest and most biologically diverse warm desert, and Big Bend National Park contains a huge amount of this biodiversity. Many species found in the park have limited distributions, found only within the park or just outside it.

So far, woolly devils are known to exist only in a small area of Big Bend National Park, and the researchers think that, based on its limited range, this plant might be particularly sensitive to changing weather patterns.

This part of the Chihuahuan Desert has faced recent severe drought conditions, and the problem is expected to worsen due to climate change. That means woolly devils could qualify as vulnerable and face a high threat of extinction.

""As climate change pushes deserts to become hotter and drier, highly specialized plants like the wooly devil face extinction,"" Lichter Marck said in the statement. ""It's possible that we've documented a species that is already on its way out.""",livescience
https://livescience.com,Eclipse map: What will tomorrow's solar eclipse look like from your state?,https://www.livescience.com/space/the-sun/eclipse-map-will-the-march-29-solar-eclipse-be-visible-in-your-state,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT","The NASA map showing where the March 29, 2025 eclipse can be seen across the Northern Hemisphere.

The sun will go partially dark tomorrow for millions of people as a partial solar eclipse blocks out a chunk of our star.

This astronomical phenomenon will fall on Saturday, March 29, 2025 , and will be visible in 13 U.S. states , parts of northeastern Canada, and across much of western Europe and Africa. To help you find out if your location is in the path of the eclipse, NASA has now released a map revealing exactly how much of the sun will be eclipsed and where, and what time the eclipse begins in each region.

The East Coast of the U.S. and Canada will see the partial eclipse take over the largest portion of the sun, with 83% of the sun being blocked out in St John's in Canada, 64% in Portland, Maine, 43% in Boston, and 22% in New York City, according to NASA. With the sun rising partially eclipsed in these locations, the moon will make our star appear to have a pair of ‘devil horns’ in the dawn light.

On the NASA map, the yellow lines show the extent of how much sun will appear to be blocked out from each location, and the green lines track the time in UTC at which the eclipse will hit its peak.

In St. John’s, Canada, for example, the partial eclipse will begin at 6:57 a.m. local time, peak at 7:52 a.m., and end at 8:51 a.m. In Boston, it will start at 6:31 a.m. local time, peak at 6:38 a.m. and end at 7:07 a.m., while in New York City, it will start at 6:44 a.m., peak at 6:46 a.m., and end at 7:04 a.m. In these spots, the moon will already be partially blocking the sun as the two celestial bodies rise above the horizon in the morning.

In London, meanwhile, where the eclipse will cover a maximum of 31% of the sun, the eclipse will start at 10:07 a.m. local time, peak at 11:03 a.m., and end at 12:00 p.m.

The orange loops on NASA's map represent areas where the eclipse starts or ends at sunrise and sunset: the left side of the western loop (over the Americas) will see the eclipse end at sunrise, while the right side of this loop will see the eclipse start at sunrise. Meanwhile, the blue line bisecting these loops show where the eclipse will hit its maximum at sunrise or sunset.

Solar eclipses occur when the moon passes between the Earth and the sun, blocking out the light from our star and casting a shadow on the Earth's surface. Unlike a total solar eclipse, where the sun is completely blocked in some areas, a partial eclipse results in the sun appearing as a crescent in the sky. This occurs because the alignment between the sun, moon, and Earth is not perfect.

How to watch the eclipse

According to timeanddate.com , over 800 million people will be able to catch at least some of the partial eclipse, although only 21 million will see the moon cover more than 50% of the sun. For everyone else, free live streams of the entire eclipse are being hosted on both sides of the Atlantic — Live Science has rounded up the best ones here .

Those hoping to catch a glimpse of the eclipse should never look at the sun directly without protection; even during a partial eclipse, the sun’s rays can cause serious eye damage. Observers should wear a pair of certified solar eclipse glasses at all times, or otherwise use a telescope or binoculars equipped with proper solar filters over the front lens.

""Do NOT look at the Sun through a camera lens, telescope, binoculars, or any other optical device while wearing eclipse glasses or using a handheld solar viewer — the concentrated solar rays will burn through the filter and cause serious eye injury,"" NASA advises.

If you miss this partial eclipse, another partial eclipse will be visible from Australia, New Zealand, Antarctica, and the Pacific Ocean on September 21 this year.

On August 12, 2026 , a total solar eclipse will be visible in Greenland, Iceland, Spain, Russia, and Portugal, while a partial eclipse will be visible in Europe, Africa, and North America.

This phenomenon occurs when the moon passes between the sun and Earth and partially blocks the sun, making it look like a bite has been taken out of our nearest star.

But staring directly at the sun without certified eclipse glasses can lead to an eye condition known as solar retinopathy, which can cause permanent vision loss.

So what is solar retinopathy and how can you protect yourself against it?

What is solar retinopathy?

Solar retinopathy occurs when intense light causes damage to the light-sensitive tissue in the retina.

The retina detects light and converts it into signals that the brain translates into the images that you see . Despite its name, solar retinopathy can be caused by any intense light source, including the sun, a laser pointer or the bright light from a welding torch. Solar retinopathy can occur within seconds of exposure to intense light in one, or more often, both eyes .

Anyone who stares at the sun, even on a regular day, can get solar retinopathy, Dr. Julie Rosenthal , a clinical assistant professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences at the University of Michigan, told Live Science. However, the eclipse is a time that those of us who don't weld or use lasers can easily get exposed to this kind of damage, she said.

People may be particularly vulnerable to solar retinopathy during a partial eclipse because the dark conditions caused by the sun being partly covered prevent the protective reflexes in the eye from properly kicking in, Live Science previously reported .

When it's light outside, for instance, people tend to squint their eyes while their pupils — which control how much light enters the eye — constrict to protect the retina, Dr. Sandra Montezuma , a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Minnesota, told Live Science. However, when it's dark, the pupils dilate, allowing more light to enter the eye and potentially damage the retina, she said.

Typically, people will not feel the damage happening as they stare at the sun as there are no pain receptors in the retina.

What are the symptoms of solar retinopathy?

A common symptom of solar retinopathy is blurred vision, often with a big blurred spot in the middle of your field of vision. Patients may also have distorted vision, for example seeing straight lines as being curved or perceiving objects as smaller than they actually are.

Other symptoms include headaches and changes in color vision when color-sending cells are damaged. Solar retinopathy can also cause a blind spot in a patients' line of sight. People may also complain that their eyes feel watery or sore.

The longer and more directly you look at the sun, as well as the more often you do it, the greater the damage. Symptoms of solar retinopathy may take hours or days to emerge after injury.

An eye doctor can image the retina to diagnose solar retinopathy, and to determine how much damage has been done to your retina.

Is solar retinopathy treatable?

There is no treatment for solar retinopathy, however, the condition will improve for many people during the first six months after damage occurs, Dr. Rosenthal said. Nevertheless, even if a patients' symptoms and vision problems get better over time, many may still have a permanent dark spot or see some wavy lines in their vision, she added.

In some cases, the retina may be so severely damaged that it does not repair itself. This can leave patients with permanent vision loss.

How can you prevent solar retinopathy?

The best way to avoid solar retinopathy is to not look directly at the sun, Dr. Montezuma said.

However, if people still want to view the partial solar eclipse on March 29, then they should ensure that they are either wearing solar eclipse glasses that comply with the ISO 12312-2 international standard , or using solar filters on skywatching equipment, she added. Solar filters are specialized filters that are added to equipment such as telescopes, binoculars or cameras that block sunlight.

If you don't have access to any of these things then another safe option is to just watch the partial eclipse online , Dr. Montezuma said.

""It's really a great time to be a part of science and to enjoy this cool phenomenon, but just make sure you're doing it safely,"" Dr. Rosenthal said.",livescience

(2025) Evolution and genetic adaptation of fishes to the deep sea. Cell, Volume 188, Issue 5, 1393 - 1408.e13. Retrieved from: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.01.002 CC BY 4.0 ))

Fish that survive in extreme deep-sea environments have developed the same genetic mutation despite evolving separately and at different times, researchers say.

The scientists also found industrial chemicals in fish and in the ground in the Mariana Trench , meaning human-made pollutants can reach some of the deepest environments on Earth.

Deep-sea fish have developed unique adaptations to survive extreme pressure, low temperatures and almost complete darkness. These species adapt to extreme conditions through unique skeletal structures, altered circadian rhythms and either vision that's extremely fine-tuned for low light, or are reliant on non-visual senses.

In a new study, published March 6 in the journal Cell , researchers analyzed the DNA of 11 fishes, including snailfish, cusk-eels and lizardfish that live in the hadal zone — the region about 19,700 feet (6,000 meters) deep and below — to better understand how they evolved under such extreme conditions.

The researchers used crewed submarines and remotely operated vehicles to collect samples from about 3,900 to 25,300 feet (1,200 to 7,700 m) below the water's surface, in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific and other trenches in the Indian Ocean.

Tracing the evolution of deep-sea fishes, the researchers' analysis revealed that the eight lineages of fish species studied entered the deep-sea environment at different times: The earliest likely entered the deep sea in the early Cretaceous period (about 145 million years ago), while others reached it during the Paleogene (66 million to 23 million years ago), and some species as recently as the Neogene period (23 million to 2.6 million years ago).

Despite different timelines for making the deep sea their home, all the fishes studied living below 9,800 feet (3,000 m) showed the same type of mutation in the Rtf1 gene, which controls how DNA is coded and expressed. This mutation occurred at least nine times across deep-sea fish lineages below 9,800 feet, study author Kun Wang , an ecologist at Northwestern Polytechnical University, told Live Science in an email.

This means all these fishes developed the same mutation separately, as a result of the same deep-sea environment, rather than as the result of a shared evolutionary ancestor — showing just how strongly deep-sea conditions shape these species' biology.

Related: How deep is the Mariana Trench?

""This study shows that deep-sea fishes, despite originating from very different branches of the fish tree of life, have evolved similar genetic adaptations to survive the harsh environment of the deep ocean — cold, dark, and high-pressure,"" Ricardo Betancur , an ichthyologist at the University of California San Diego who was not involved in the new study, told Live Science in an email.

It's an example of convergent evolution, where unrelated species independently evolve similar traits in response to similar conditions. ""It's a powerful reminder that evolution often reuses the same limited set of solutions when faced with similar challenges — in this case, adapting to the extreme conditions of the deep sea,"" Betancur said.

The expeditions also revealed human-made pollutants in the Mariana Trench and Philippine Trench. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) — harmful chemicals used in electrical equipment and appliances until they were banned in the 1970s — contaminated the liver tissues of hadal snailfish, the scientists discovered.

High concentrations of PCBs and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), flame retardant chemicals used in consumer products until they fell out of popularity in the early 2000s, were also found in sediment cores extracted from more than 32,800 feet (10,000 m) deep in the Mariana Trench.

Previous research has also found chemical pollutants in the Mariana Trench, as well as microplastics in the deep sea . The new findings further reveal the impacts of human activity even in this ecosystem that's so far removed from human life.

Refractor telescopes normally use curved lenses to magnify distant objects through a process called refraction . Similar to a magnifying glass, the curved lens of a telescope bends light and directs it to a focal point, making objects appear larger.

However, traditional lenses quickly become impractical for space telescopes studying stars or galaxies millions of light years away. This is because the further away an object is, the more magnification is required to bring it into focus, and therefore the thicker and heavier the lens needs to be.

That's why scientists have explored flat lenses, which should in theory be lighter and less bulky. The challenge with them, however, is that light interacts with them differently than with curved lenses.

Visible light is a type of electromagnetic radiation , which is transmitted in waves or particles at different wavelengths and frequencies. When light passes through a flat lens, it diffracts, scattering wavelengths in multiple directions and resulting in a blurry, unfocused image.

But a new ""multilevel diffractive lens"" (MDL) developed by scientists features a multi-level structure consisting of ""microscopically small concentric rings."" These effectively channel different wavelengths of light towards the same focal point to create a sharp, color-accurate image.

The new 100-millimeter (3.9-inch) diameter lens, which has a 200 mm (7.8 in) focal length, is just 2.4 micrometers thick. Optimized for the 400 to 800 nm wavelength range for visible light, this lens is much lighter than a conventional curved lens and eliminates color distortions.

The scientists published their findings Feb. 3 in the journal Applied Physics Letters . The study was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), NASA and the Office of Naval Research.

""Our demonstration is a stepping stone towards creating very large aperture lightweight flat lenses with the capability of capturing full-color images for use in air- and space-based telescopes,"" lead study author Apratim Majumder , assistant professor in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Utah, said in a statement .

Ahead of the curve

Scientists have designed flat lenses in the past, most notably the fresnel zone plate (FZP) , which features concentric ridges etched across the surface. However, the ridges of FZPs break light into separate wavelengths and diffract them at different angles, resulting in color distortions.

The MDL is unique in that its concentric rings exist at varying depths within the lens itself. As light passes through, the microscopic indentations adjust how different wavelengths diffract, preventing them from spreading apart as they normally would. This controlled diffraction brings all wavelengths of light into focus at the same time, resulting in a sharper, color-accurate image.

As well as avoiding the color distortions of FZPs, the researchers said the new flat lens offered the same light-bending power as traditional curved lenses. In the study, they used the MDL to capture images of the sun and moon. Lunar images they took revealed key geological features, while they also used it in solar imaging to capture visible sunspots.

""Simulating the performance of these lenses over a very large bandwidth, from visible to near-infrared, involved solving complex computational problems involving very large datasets,"" Majumder said in the statement. ""Once we optimized the design of the lens’ microstructures, the manufacturing process required very stringent process control and environmental stability.""

The researchers said the technology had applications in astronomy, astrophotography and other ""long-range imaging tasks"" including ""airborne and space-based imaging applications."" What's more, production may not be far off.",livescience

https://theconversation.com,Chewing gum: another way for microplastics to enter your body?,https://theconversation.com/chewing-gum-another-way-for-microplastics-to-enter-your-body-252842,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 16:30:40 GMT","We are riddled with microplastics. It is in our bloodstream, in our lungs, in our liver – pretty much anywhere you look in the human body, you will find minuscule bits of plastic.

And there are many ways for us to ingest, inhale or otherwise absorb these tiny fragments. For example, a single plastic teabag sheds over 10 billion microplastic particles into a cup of tea.

And if you redecorate your home and sand down the old paintwork, the plastic binders in the paint can release microplastics into the air, which you might then inhale. You could swallow them when you drink from single-use plastic water bottles. Now another source of microplastics in the body has been discovered: chewing gum.

Chewing gum contains long molecules called polymers. Some brands of gum contain natural polymers from tree sap. Others contain synthetic polymers derived from the petroleum industry. These various polymers are similar to plastics – and some actually are plastics. Chewing gum polymers, both natural and synthetic, can release microparticles when they are worn down by chewing.

In the chewing gum study – which was presented at the American Chemical Society meeting 25 March – a single volunteer chewed ten brands of chewing gum – five natural and five synthetic. Saliva samples were taken from the volunteer’s mouth and put under the microscope. Surprisingly, microplastics were found in both the natural and synthetic chewing gums.

The researchers, from the University of California, Los Angeles, calculated that one piece of gum could shed hundreds or a few thousand microplastic particles into the mouth, where they probably ended up being swallowed.

The types of plastics found in the gums were polystyrenes (used for things like takeaway food containers), polyethylenes (such as those used to make plastic grocery bags) and polypropylenes (which are used to make, among other things, car bumpers and medicine bottles).

But, before we start worrying about the microplastics liberated by chewing gum, we need to know how large they were.

Size matters

The microplastics found in the saliva of the gum-chewing volunteer were 20 micrometres or more in size. That is about the diameter of the thinnest human hair. But from the perspective of a cell in the human body, 20 microns is huge (a red blood cell, for instance, is about seven microns in diameter).

This is important because the microplastics that are known to be capable of harming cells and embryos are 500 to 1,000 times smaller than that (20 to 500 nanometers). These super-small microplastics are called nanoplastics.

Nanoplastics are bad news because they are small enough to be engulfed by living cells via a process called endocytosis. When nanoplastics are absorbed into cells, they can cause all sorts of trouble, such as triggering the cell to produce toxic molecules called reactive oxygen species. These toxins may not kill the cell outright, but they can weaken it.

Likewise, the plastic particles that have been shown to cause birth defects in animal embryos are also the very small ones (the nanoplastics), not the much larger microplastics that were found in the saliva of the gum chewer.

The chewing gum study is fascinating. It shows how easily we can unwittingly expose ourselves to hundreds of microplastics. However, we cannot confidently assign any kind of health risk to chewing gum.

The microplastics that are liberated by the chewing of gum are relatively huge, and we know nothing about the effects – if any – of such large particles in the human body. And we don’t know if chewing gum releases nanoplastics at all. The trouble is that nanoplastics are so tiny that they require specialised apparatus to detect them. For that reason, the researchers in the US who studied chewing gum decided not to look for them.

Some commentators think that the potential health risks of microplastics have been exaggerated, while others criticise the quality of some of the scientific studies on microplastics. We are inclined to agree with these criticisms. Hopefully, it will not be too long before we truly understand whether the microplastic scare will turn out to be justified – or just hype.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,The spring clock change may affect your mind and body longer than you realise,https://theconversation.com/the-spring-clock-change-may-affect-your-mind-and-body-longer-than-you-realise-252987,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 17:19:47 GMT","Twice a year, around a quarter of the world’s population dutifully reset their clocks. It may seem like a minor adjustment, but some people struggle with fatigue, irritability, and brain fog in the days following the transition. For others — especially night owls — the adjustment period can last for weeks.

Circadian rhythms govern many physiological processes in plants, animals and even bacteria, highlighting life’s remarkable sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions.

Your biological internal clock is controlled in a small region of the brain called the hypothalamus. It regulates hormone release, body temperature and metabolism. So if your circadian rhythm is out of kilter, those things will be disrupted too.

Most people take three to seven days to adjust to daylight saving time (DST). However, night owls can take two to three weeks to realign their sleep-wake cycles.

Research suggests diet also plays a role. People who eat high-fat diets seem to experience prolonged circadian misalignment after the spring clock change. A 2008 study on rodents found that those on high-fat diets adapted 20% more slowly to a six-hour light shift compared to those on low-fat diets. Scientists don’t fully understand why diet and circadian rhythms are linked.

We do know light exposure is also important for adapting to time change. One hypothesis suggests that a high-fat diet reduces circadian sensitivity to light. Researchers have wondered whether the connection between high-fat diet and circadian sensitivity may be since late evening eating is associated with weight gain. But a 2024 study found no significant differences in meal timing between diet groups, suggesting that it’s the food itself, rather than the time it is eaten, that’s the key factor.

Exposure to natural light is one of the most important factors in helping the body adjust to a new time. The more morning sunlight a person gets, the faster their circadian rhythm realigns. Research suggests that adaptation is harder in spring than in autumn, with increased wakefulness during sleep (10–30 minutes more), greater sleep fragmentation (between 5–20%), and poorer sleep quality after the spring transition.

The link between natural light and cognitive function was highlighted by a 2020 study which demonstrated the benefits of increased daylight exposure. Thirty participants spent one week working in each of two office environments with identical layouts, furnishings and orientations. But one was fitted with smart glass (that can change its tint) and was set to optimise daylight. And the other had traditional blinds, that were closed. Participants in the optimised daylight condition slept 37 minutes longer and scored 42% higher on decision-making tasks.

The human circadian rhythm runs slightly longer than 24 hours (typically 24.2–24.5 hours). This makes clock delays (autumn transition) easier to adjust to than clock advances (spring transition) because our body naturally drifts forward each day. Delaying sleep aligns with this tendency, whereas advancing sleep disrupts melatonin release, which regulates your energy levels and the natural urge to go to bed.

In 2007, German researchers monitored 50 healthy adults for four weeks before and after each transition and found that spring adaptation took five to seven days longer than fall adaptation.

Our core body temperature increases throughout the day, peaking in the late afternoon. A 2008 Finnish study studied nine adults before and after both transitions and found that during the spring transition, people’s gradual increase in body temperature was delayed by 30–60 minutes. It also found sleep quality dropped by 5–15%, and nighttime movement increased by 10–25% — all indicators of circadian misalignment. Total time in bed increased after the spring transition but participants’ sleep was fragmented and of lower quality.

The spring clock change seems to create a slightly increased risk for those with life-threatening health conditions. Research has linked daylight saving time (DST) transitions to changes in mortality rates, during the first eight weeks after the transition, particularly in relation to cardiovascular complications. A 2024 study analysing 14 million deaths in the US from 2015 to 2019 found a slight increase in all deaths after the spring transition but a decrease in mortality after the autumn transition.

The study also found a rising trend in dementia-related mortality, with a 5% increase in deaths peaking in the fifth week after the spring transition. Additionally, a slight increase in cancer-related mortality was noted in the first week after DST begins.

Research also shows it’s a good idea to pay extra attention when you’re on the roads after the clocks go forward. A 2023 study investigating the effects of DST on driving fatigue found drivers showed signs of greater fatigue after the clock change. Their cars swayed in their lanes about 13% more often and their eyelids closed slightly more often. Participants still showed impairment one month later.

However, in a follow-on trial after the autumn return to standard time, drivers reported feeling less sleepy.

These findings suggest the spring transition can have a ripple effect that lasts for weeks. It also suggests we are more finely tuned to the natural world than we might think.

Spring DST may seem like a simple one-hour shift, but for many, it’s much more than that.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,White snus: why ‘tobacco free’ doesn’t mean risk free,https://theconversation.com/white-snus-why-tobacco-free-doesnt-mean-risk-free-252085,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 16:30:45 GMT","A habit that is worrying health authorities in Sweden where increasing numbers of teenagers are taking what’s known as “snus” is also concerning football authorities in England where one-fifth of professional players are regularly indulging because they say it improves their game.

White snus consists of small, tobacco-free pouches containing nicotine, plant-based fibres and flavourings. These pouches look a like a cross between a tea bag and a tablet of chewing gum, and they’re put between the lip and the gum to give users a burst of nicotine without some of the drawbacks of tobacco. Nicotine strength varies widely between different white snus products.

Traditional snus, a moist brown tobacco product, is almost exclusive to Sweden. However, the introduction of white snus – also known as nicotine pouches – has led to rapid global expansion.

The rise in popularity of white snus around the world can be attributed to aggressive social media marketing campaigns where “Zynfluencers” are sponsored to promote white snus in their lifestyle content and the product is advertised across social media. While marketing for cigarettes and vapes is strictly regulated in the EU, the rules for white snus are up to the individual countries to decide. Many countries don’t regulate white snus so consumers – even very young ones – can order the nicotine pouches easily.

It’s not just English male professional footballers who’re fans of white snus. In Sweden, 15% of young women aged 16-29 use white snus daily, while only 2.5 % smoke cigarettes daily in the same age group.

Some commercials target women by suggesting that white snus offers a discreet “clean” way to feel the benefits of a nicotine hit. They highlight that users report a rush of endorphins that can relieve stress and pain and improve mood and memory – without the smell of cigarette smoke and the inconvenience of smoking or vaping breaks.

The marketing of white snus often stresses that they are “tobacco-free” because the pouches do not contain tobacco leaf. But that label can be misleading – the nicotine in these products is usually derived from tobacco leaves. Some also confuse tobacco-free with nicotine-free. Both these misconceptions can make consumers think that the pouches are safe.

Advertisements often emphasise how white snus can be used anywhere and enhance social situations, while offering a variety of flavours from coffee to spearmint and black cherry, and serving as an alternative to cigarettes, vapes and traditional forms of tobacco.

Despite their growing popularity – and marketing attempts to associate white snus with healthier nicotine use – little is known about the specific health risks of white snus. But a lack of research into the effects of nicotine pouches does not mean they are safe.

A healthy alternative?

The nicotine pouch was originally developed by a nicotine replacement therapy company in the early 2000s – but they didn’t gain traction until 2016 when the tobacco snus company Swedish Match introduced their product Zyn, which became a leading nicotine pouch brand in the US. Zyn is now owned by Philip Morris International, one of the world’s largest tobacco companies White snus is not an approved nicotine replacement therapy, which means that it is not recommended as an aid to quit smoking.

While nicotine-free white snus exists, most products on the market contain nicotine. Nicotine is highly addictive, so many of those who try a nicotine product – no matter which one – will find it hard to stop using it. Nicotine has several effects on the body, including increased heart rate and activation of the brain’s reward system, which contributes to its appeal.

Young people are especially sensitive to the addictive properties of nicotine. The wide range of white snus flavours available, often fruit, menthol or candy, may further lower the threshold for use.

But research suggests that nicotine may also have a negative impact on brain development. Other potential risks include a negative effects on cardiovascular and oral health. But long-term effects specific to white snus remain unclear. Few studies have been conducted, and many of the existing ones have been sponsored by the tobacco industry. There is a need for large, independent, high-quality studies to assess long-term health risks.

With many young people using white snus, the unanswered questions about its health effects become more pressing. Until more research is available, it’s important to stay cautious: “tobacco-free” does not mean risk free.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Early-onset Alzheimer’s: new drug shows promise in slowing the disease,https://theconversation.com/early-onset-alzheimers-new-drug-shows-promise-in-slowing-the-disease-253049,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 13:11:11 GMT","Alzheimer’s disease is usually associated with old age. But around 5%-10% of all Alzheimer’s cases occur in people under the age of 65. Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease progresses more rapidly and often strikes people in the prime of their lives. Treatment options remain limited.

But new data from a recent clinical trial suggests that a previously discontinued experimental drug, called gantenerumab, could help. The study found that gantenerumab reduced the buildup of amyloid plaques – one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease – in the brain. This may help slow cognitive decline in people with early-onset Alzheimer’s.

Early-onset Alzheimer’s is often linked to genetic mutations in three specific genes. These mutations cause the brain to produce excessive amounts of amyloid beta, a protein that clumps together to form plaques. These plaques disrupt brain function, leading to memory loss.

Early-onset Alzheimer’s advances quickly – and the rapid decline is devastating. That’s why researchers are racing to find treatments that can slow the disease.

Read more: Young-onset Alzheimer’s can be diagnosed from as early as 30 – and the symptoms are often different

The recent clinical trial was a randomised, placebo-controlled study to evaluate gantenerumab’s effects on people with early-onset Alzheimer’s. Researchers monitored changes in the participants’ cognitive abilities, and also used brain imaging and blood biomarkers (the presence of specific proteins in the blood which are linked to Alzheimer’s), to track the disease’s progress throughout the study.

The trial included 73 participants with rare inherited genetic mutations known to cause early-onset Alzheimer’s. These participants were either asymptomatic or had mild Alzheimer’s symptoms at the start of the study.

The results were intriguing. In a subgroup of 22 participants, who hadn’t had any cognitive issues at the start of the study, taking the treatment for an average of eight years reduced the risk of developing symptoms from a nearly 100% likelihood, to 50%. Brain scans also showed a notable decrease in amyloid buildup.

Immune defenders

Gantenerumab is a monoclonal antibody – a lab-engineered protein designed to attach to amyloid beta in the brain. By binding to these plaques, it signals the immune system to clear them away. This may potentially slow Alzheimer’s progression.

The drug works by engaging microglial cells. These are the brain’s primary immune defenders. Microglia constantly monitor the brain for damage and remove harmful substances, including amyloid beta. However, in people with Alzheimer’s disease, microglia often fail to clear plaques efficiently. Gantenerumab enhances this natural defence mechanism by tagging amyloid plaques, making them easier for the microglia to recognise and break down.

Amyloid beta is thought to play a central role in Alzheimer’s by triggering inflammation, interfering with cell communication and ultimately killing neurons. By removing these plaques, gantenerumab may help to protect brain function. However, it doesn’t reverse existing damage – which is why early intervention is critical.

An advantage of gantenerumab is that it can cross the blood-brain barrier – the protective shield that blocks many drugs and harmful substances from reaching the brain. This allows it to act directly on amyloid plaques, making it more effective than some earlier treatments that struggled with drug delivery.

But as promising as these results are, gantenerumab isn’t without risks.

A major concern is amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. These are swelling or small spots of bleeding in the brain that show up on MRI scans. This is a common side-effect of amyloid-targeting therapies.

In this latest trial, 53% of participants experienced these amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, including small brain bleeds in 27% of participants, brain swelling in 30% of participants and iron deposits from bleeding in 6%. While no participants had major brain haemorrhages or died from the treatment, these side-effects remain a serious concern – requiring regular monitoring through brain scans.

Another limitation is the modest cognitive benefit observed in the trial. While gantenerumab reduced amyloid plaques, the extent to which this translates into meaningful improvements in memory and thinking skills remains unclear.

Gantenerumab is also expensive to manufacture, which could make widespread access difficult if it gains regulatory approval. As this is an experimental drug, we do not currently know how much it would cost. But other similar anti-amyloid therapies, such as donanemab, currently cost around £25,000 per patient per year.

The study also had a small sample size and only focused on a rare genetic form of early-onset Alzheimer’s. More research is needed to see how these results may apply to the wider dementia community.

The future of treatment

Although the trial was terminated early after the study’s sponsor pulled out, these findings contribute to the ongoing debate over the causes of Alzheimer’s disease.

According to the amyloid hypothesis, the buildup of amyloid plaques in the brain is the main cause of Alzheimer’s disease. Clearing these plaques will slow the disease’s progression. The success of the Alzheimer’s drugs lecanemab, donanemab and now gantenerumab, lend themselves to this theory.

This study also underscores the importance of early diagnosis. Amyloid-targeting therapies appear to work best in the early stages of Alzheimer’s, before significant brain damage occurs. Advances in biomarker testing – including blood tests and brain scans – could help identify at-risk people sooner. This would improve the effectiveness of drugs such as gantenerumab.

Although gantenerumab is not a cure and was discontinued by its manufacturer in 2022 because it failed to demonstrate efficacy in slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, this new data could perhaps lead to gantenerumab being manufactured again. It also represents another step forward in the fight against Alzheimer’s.

Alzheimer’s research is advancing faster than ever before. Whether a success or a setback, each new study adds to our understanding of the disease and brings us closer to more effective treatments. For now, the gantenerumab trial offers a hopeful sign that scientists are making progress in slowing the course of this devastating condition.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Nasa’s Curiosity rover has found the longest chain carbon molecules yet on Mars. It’s a significant finding in the search for alien life,https://theconversation.com/nasas-curiosity-rover-has-found-the-longest-chain-carbon-molecules-yet-on-mars-its-a-significant-finding-in-the-search-for-alien-life-253249,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 13:11:14 GMT","Nasa’s Curiosity Mars rover has detected the largest organic (carbon-containing) molecules ever found on the red planet. The discovery is one of the most significant findings in the search for evidence of past life on Mars. This is because, on Earth at least, relatively complex, long-chain carbon molecules are involved in biology. These molecules could actually be fragments of fatty acids, which are found in, for example, the membranes surrounding biological cells.

Scientists think that, if life ever emerged on Mars, it was probably microbial in nature. Because microbes are so small, it’s difficult to be definitive about any potential evidence for life found on Mars. Such evidence needs more powerful scientific instruments that are too large to be put on a rover.

The organic molecules found by Curiosity consist of carbon atoms linked in long chains, with other elements bonded to them, like hydrogen and oxygen. They come from a 3.7-billion-year-old rock dubbed Cumberland, encountered by the rover at a presumed dried-up lakebed in Mars’s Gale Crater. Scientists used the Sample Analysis at Mars (Sam) instrument on the Nasa rover to make their discovery.

Scientists were actually looking for evidence of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins and therefore key components of life as we know it. But this unexpected finding is almost as exciting. The research is published in Proceedings of the National Academies of Science.

Among the molecules were decane, which has 10 carbon atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms, and dodecane, with 12 carbons and 26 hydrogen atoms. These are known as alkanes, which fall under the umbrella of the chemical compounds known as hydrocarbons.

It’s an exciting time in the search for life on Mars. In March this year, scientists presented evidence of features in a different rock sampled elsewhere on Mars by the Perseverance rover. These features, dubbed “leopard spots” and “poppy seeds”, could have been produced by the action of microbial life in the distant past, or not. The findings were presented at a US conference and have not yet been published in a peer reviewed journal.

The Mars Sample Return mission, a collaboration between Nasa and the European Space Agency, offers hope that samples of rock collected and stored by Perseverance could be brought to Earth for study in laboratories. The powerful instruments available in terrestrial labs could finally confirm whether or not there is clear evidence for past life on Mars. However, in 2023, an independent review board criticised increases in Mars Sample Return’s budget. This prompted the agencies to rethink how the mission could be carried out. They are currently studying two revised options.

Signs of life?

Cumberland was found in a region of Gale Crater called Yellowknife Bay. This area contains rock formations that look suspiciously like those formed when sediment builds up at the bottom of a lake. One of Curiosity’s scientific goals is to examine the prospect that past conditions on Mars would have been suitable for the development of life, so an ancient lakebed is the perfect place to look for them.

The researchers think that the alkane molecules may once have been components of more complex fatty acid molecules. On Earth, fatty acids are components of fats and oils. They are produced through biological activity in processes that help form cell membranes, for example. The suggested presence of fatty acids in this rock sample has been around for several years, but the new paper details the full evidence.

Fatty acids are long, linear hydrocarbon molecules with a carboxyl group (COOH) at one end and a methyl group (CH3) at the other, forming a chain of carbon and hydrogen atoms.

A fat molecule consists of two main components: glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol is an alcohol molecule with three carbon atoms, five hydrogens, and three hydroxyl (chemically bonded oxygen and hydrogen, OH) groups. Fatty acids may have 4-36 carbon atoms; however, most of them have 12-18. The longest carbon chains found in Cumberland are 12 atoms long.

Organic molecules preserved in ancient Martian rocks provide a critical record of the past habitability of Mars and could be chemical biosignatures (signs that life was once there).

The sample from Cumberland has been analysed by the Sam instrument many times, using different experimental techniques, and has shown evidence of clay minerals, as well as the first (smaller and simpler) organic molecules found on Mars, back in 2015. These included several classes of chlorinated and sulphur-containing organic compounds in Gale crater sedimentary rocks, with chemical structures of up to six carbon atoms. The new discovery doubles the number of carbon atoms found in a single molecule on Mars.

The alkane molecules are significant in the search for biosignatures on Mars, but how they actually formed remains unclear. They could also be derived through geological or other chemical mechanisms that do not involve fatty acids or life. These are known as abiotic sources. However, the fact that they exist intact today in samples that have been exposed to a harsh environment for many millions of years gives astrobiologists (scientists who study the possibility of life beyond Earth) hope that evidence of ancient life might still be detectable today.

It is possible the sample contains even longer chain organic molecules. It may also contain more complex molecules that are indicative of life, rather than geological processes. Unfortunately, Sam is not capable of detecting those, so the next step is to deliver Martian rock and soil to more capable laboratories on the Earth. Mars Sample Return would do this with the samples already gathered by the Perseverance Mars rover. All that’s needed now is the budget.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Tourists are cancelling trips to the US – here’s how this could affect its economy,https://theconversation.com/tourists-are-cancelling-trips-to-the-us-heres-how-this-could-affect-its-economy-252858,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 17:50:36 GMT","The United States is one of the top three most visited countries in the world. The big draw cards – cities such as San Francisco, New York and Chicago and national parks such as Yosemite – have attracted international tourists for decades. This combined with its role as a global business powerhouse meant it had 66.5 million visitors in 2023 – and the 2024 figure is expected to be higher still.

But a lot has changed in recent months, and 2025’s figures may not be as strong. The 2024 reelection of Donald Trump as the president of the United States and the consequential changes in foreign diplomacy and relations, alongside internal cultural shifts, are starting to change global attitudes towards the US – attitudes that appear to be affecting tourists’ desire to visit the US.

In a recent report by research firm Tourism Economics, inbound travel to the US is now projected to decline by 5.5% this year, instead of growing by nearly 9% as had previously been forecast. A further escalation in tariff and trade wars could result in further reductions in international tourism, which could amount to a US$18 billion (£13.8 billion) annual reduction in tourist spending in 2025.

There is already some evidence of travel cancellations. Since Trump announced 25% tariffs on many Canadian goods, the number of Canadians driving across the border at some crossings has fallen by up to 45%, on some days, when compared to last year. Canada is the biggest source of international tourists to the US. Air Canada has announced it is reducing flights to some US holiday destinations, including Las Vegas, from March, as demand reduces.

According to a March poll by Canadian market researcher Leger, 36% of Canadians who had planned trips to the United States had already cancelled them. According to data from the aviation analytics company OAG, passenger bookings on Canada to US routes are down by over 70% compared to the same period last year. This comes after the U.S. Travel Association warned that even a 10% reduction in Canadian inbound travel could result in a US$2.1 billion (£1.6 billion) loss in spending, putting 140,000 hospitality jobs at risk.

An unwelcoming environment?

Some would-be visitors have cited an unwelcoming political climate as part of a concern about visiting the US – including angry rhetoric about foreigners, migrants and the LGBTQ+ community. The Tourism Economics report also cited “polarizing Trump Administration policies and rhetoric” as a factor in travel cancellations.

There are other factors that may influence travellers from, for instance, western Europe, which represented 37% of overseas travel to the US last year. These include US tariffs pushing prices up at home and the US administration’s perceived alignment with Russia in the war in Ukraine.

Research by YouGov in March found that western European attitudes towards the US have become more negative since Trump’s reelection last November. More than half of people in Britain (53%), Germany (56%), Sweden (63%) and Denmark (74%) now have an unfavourable opinion of the US. In five of the seven countries polled, figures for US favourability are at the lowest since polling began in November 2016.

Border issues

Some high-profile cases at the US border could also be putting off tourists. In March, a British woman was handcuffed and detained for more than ten days by US Customs Enforcement after a visa problem. In the same month, a Canadian tourist was detained after attempting to renew her visa at the US-Mexico border. During the 12-day detention, she was held in crowded jail cells and even put in chains.

Mexico is the US’s second largest inbound travel market. Tourism Economics suggests that issues around new border enforcement rules will raise concerns with potential Mexican tourists. During Trump’s first term in office, Mexican visits to the US fell by 3%. In February this year, air travel from Mexico had already fallen 6% when compared to 2024.

Many countries including Canada have been updating their travel advice for the US. For instance, on March 15 the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office updated its advice for the US, warning visitors that “you may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules”. The previous version of advice, from February, had no mention of arrest or detention. Germany has made similar updates to its travel advisory, after several Germans were recently detained for weeks by US border officials.

Multiple European countries, including France, Germany, Denmark and Norway have also issued specific travel warnings to transgender and non-binary citizens, as US authorities demand tourists declare their biological sex at birth on visa applications. This comes as the US has stopped issuing of passports with a X marker – commonly used by those identifying as non-binary – for its own citizens.

Alternative destinations

As thousands of travellers cancel their trips to the US, other destinations are seeing a spike in interest. Hotels in Bermuda have reported a surge in enquiries as Canadians relocate business and leisure trips away from the US, with some predicting a 20% increase in revenue from Canadian visits.

Europe too has reported increased bookings from Canada, with rental properties experiencing a 32% jump in summer reservations when compared to last year, according to some reports.

There are already growing concerns that visa and entry restrictions will disrupt fans and athletes from enjoying 2026 men’s Fifa World Cup, held on sites in the US, Canada and Mexico. Visitors from some countries, such as Brazil, Turkey and Colombia, could wait up to 700 days to obtain visas.

https://theconversation.com,US’s new ‘America First’ intelligence approach downplays Russia and ignores climate change,https://theconversation.com/uss-new-america-first-intelligence-approach-downplays-russia-and-ignores-climate-change-253154,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 16:30:38 GMT","The recently appointed US director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, and other top intelligence officials appeared before the Senate intelligence committee to discuss the US intelligence services’ annual threat assessment (ATA).

Most of the committee’s time and attention was focused on the revelation by the editor of the Atlantic magazine that he had been inadvertently added to an insecure chat group, in which top security officials discussed detailed plans for an attack on Yemen. Gabbard and her colleagues steadfastly refused to admit that this had been a security breach. It was an unhelpful distraction from the main event, a discussion of the latest ATA report.

Produced annually, the ATA is a combined assessment by 18 US intelligence agencies, headed up by the Office for National Intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency, of the major threats to national security in America. The 2025 version is the first of Donald Trump’s second term and reflects Trumpism’s major shift from America’s previous security priorities in three ways.

First, the assessment gave priority to what it identified as domestic security threats over those posed by foreign adversaries. Second, the report ignored climate change as a critical threat to US security. And third, there was an unprecedented softening of the language in relation to Russia.

In her opening statement Gabbard identified “cartels, gangs and other transnational criminal organisations” as “what most immediately and directly threatens the United States and the wellbeing of the American people”.

These threats are closer to home, but they hardly warrant their lead billing – particularly given the way that Trump himself has regularly invoked the threat of “world war three” ever since he started his campaign to return to the White House more than two years ago.

But what they do indicate is an America increasingly focused on the narrow predilections of its president and his Maga supporters.

An even more notable omission is the absence of any mention of climate change, either as an existential threat to human life as we know it or as a force multiplier to other threats such as migration, environmental disasters or famine.

This led to a testy exchange between Gabbard and Senator Angus King, an independent senator from Maine. King asked the director of national intelligence: “Has global climate change been solved? Why is that not in this report? And who made the decision that it should not be in the report when it’s been in every one of the 11 prior reports?” Gabbard replied: “What I focused this annual threat assessment on … are the most extreme and critical direct threats to our national security.”

This was an unconvincing response, given that the 2025 ATA specifically notes the security impact of melting sea ice in the Arctic. The report also notes increasing cooperation between Russia and China in the Arctic and a growing Chinese footprint in the region.

Russian threat relegated

But the most notable difference in this year’s ATA concerns Russia. The Trump administration’s new approach to Moscow and the Russian leadership infuses the language and substance of this year’s intelligence report. The 2024 threat assessment led the section on Russia with the assertion that Moscow “seeks to project and defend its interests globally and to undermine the United States and the west”.

In 2025, the headline finding about the threat from Russia is that the Kremlin’s objective is “to restore Russian strength and security in its near abroad against perceived US and western encroachment”. This, the report said, “has increased the risks of unintended escalation between Russia and Nato”.

EPA-EFE/Francis Chung/pool

Gone are the references to Russia as “a resilient and capable adversary across a wide range of domains”. Instead, this year’s ATA downplays the actual threat that the Kremlin poses to America’s interests by describing Russia merely as an “enduring potential threat to US power, presence and global interests”.

The 2025 report also assesses that Russia “has seized the upper hand in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and is on a path to accrue greater leverage to press Kyiv and its western backers to negotiate an end to the war that grants Moscow concessions it seeks”. It doesn’t question why that might be the case or how it could be reversed.

Moreover, it presents the Kremlin’s malign influence activities as aimed at countering threats. This affords them an unprecedented degree of legitimacy and implies that the west poses a threat to Russia. This, of course, has long been a favourite talking point of Vladimir Putin’s.

Change of policy

More than just a change in threat assessment, the 2025 ATA doubles down on a change in policy. The report takes as a given that “Russia retains momentum (in) a grinding war of attrition … (which) will lead to a gradual but steady erosion of Kyiv’s position on the battlefield, regardless of any US or allied attempts to impose new and greater costs on Moscow.”

The inevitable conclusion is that the US should not pressure Russia to halt its illegal and brutal war of aggression against Ukraine. Rather Washington’s approach to security should accommodate the Kremlin’s ever multiplying conditions for a ceasefire.

The report’s language on China is less ambiguous. It describes Beijing as “the most comprehensive and robust military threat to US national security” and as likely to “continue to expand its coercive and subversive malign influence activities to weaken the United States internally and globally”.

The report also notes that Beijing is critical to the alignment of all four major state actors that pose threats to the US: China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.

But China, and the other state adversaries, still take second place in America’s national security thinking to accommodate the administration’s inwardly focused “America First” mindset. This is not merely an indication of the isolationist tendencies in the foreign policy approach of Trumpism. It’s a deliberate abdication of US global leadership.

Trump and his team may believe that this will make America more secure – and the 2025 threat assessment is framed in a way that justifies such an approach. But it fails to provide any credible evidence that it might succeed.",theconversation

At the crossroads between Asia and Europe, Turkey is strategically important to just about everyone, and is emerging as a clever negotiator.

Since the early 2000s, Turkey has relied on a foreign policy approach that emphasised cooperation instead of competition. Economic ties were a priority, which helped Turkey steadily improve its relationships with Russia, Iran and Syria.

While remaining a part of Nato and a major trading partner with the European Union, Turkey views its ties with Russia, Ukraine, China and countries in the Middle East as equally important. Turkey has shown that it will work with whatever government benefits its interests, and has taken advantage of regional conflicts to be a convenient ally when needed.

At the same time, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has no qualms about confronting both friends and rivals equally, giving it strategic flexibility.

Rocky relationship with Russia

Turkey is Russia’s second biggest trading partner. Ankara continues to rely on Russian gas and banking networks, doing over US$60 billion (£46.3 billion) in trade annually with Moscow. The Turkish relationship with Russia improved dramatically in 1995 when Russia stopped supporting the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) and Turkey stopped supporting Chechen rebels.

Since then, Turkey has maintained a functional relationship with Russia, while never being pliant to Moscow.

Turkey was critical of Russia setting up military bases in Syria, in Tartus and Khmeimim and as it controls the airspace in northern Syria it also has the ability to restrict Russian access. Ankara has also used its military presence in Idlib, in northern Syria, to check Russian influence in the past. Turkey’s drone offensive in Idlib in 2020 helped the Syrian opposition and pushed back Syrian government and Russian-backed activity in the north-west.

The importance of the Black Sea

The Black Sea is another area of competition where Turkey has emerged with the upper hand during the war in Ukraine. Russia aimed to exercise control over the Black Sea, even seizing several Ukrainian ports which affected global grain supply in 2022.

But Turkey negotiated the release of millions of tonnes of grain and has ensured the safety of shipping routes through the Black Sea by enforcing the Montreux Convention. This 1936 agreement granted Turkish control over the shipping route between the Black Sea (through the Bosporus Strait, the Sea of Marmara and the Dardanelles, through which hundreds of millions of tons tonnes of cargo pass each year) and the Mediterranean.

Citing the agreement, Turkey also restricted Russian reinforcements into the Black Sea, which has restricted Russian naval power considerably.

Though Turkey has not levied sanctions on Russia and has kept its revenue streams open, Turkey also does not accept the Russian annexation of Crimea. With more than 5 million Turks claiming to have Crimean Tatar roots, Crimea has both strategic and historical importance to Turkey.

Yet, Turkey maintains communication with Moscow (and Erdoğan and Vladimir Putin are “dear friends”). Complicating this “friendship” is the fact that Turkey also supports Ukraine, supplying it with Bayraktar TB2 drones, heavy machine guns, laser-guided missiles, electronic warfare systems, armoured vehicles and protective gear.

Ultimately, Turkey wants Ukraine to remain independent in order to check Russian naval power in the Black Sea. As such, Turkey is likely to work with Nato to ensure that Ukraine is not defeated.

To that end, Turkey is willing to contribute peacekeepers to a post-ceasefire settlement, under the right conditions.

Meanwhile, Turkey has used the Ukraine conflict to diversify its supply routes for energy (relying more on suppliers from the Caucasus region and central Asia), to reduce its dependence on Russia. Turkey is in a strong position, especially with the discovery of gas reserves in the Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean. Ankara aims to become an energy hub facilitating the transit of gas from the Caucasus, central Asia and Russia to Europe through the Trans-Anatolian natural gas pipeline.

Turkey and Syria

Turkey’s relationship with its neighbour Syria has also been pragmatic and shrewd. Turkey was able to pursue rapprochement with Syria in 2005, when Bashar al-Assad became the first Syrian president to visit Turkey since Syria gained its independence in 1946.

But while Erdoğan maintained a relationship (to prevent Syria from moving even closer to Iran), he ultimately chose to abandon this relationship when it no longer suited him. He hosted anti-Assad figures in Turkey from time to time, and created a safe zone on its border which housed displaced Syrians and armed fighters. He gave rebels the go-ahead to oust Assad in 2024.

Just as the war in Syria provided Turkey with opportunities, so too has the conflict in Ukraine. Ankara has strengthened its bargaining position and pushed for greater diplomatic and economic concessions from western allies. Turkey is taking advantage of the US’s retreat from Nato to push for closer cooperation with Europe.

Turkey also is taking advantage of Donald Trump’s more lenient policies towards Russia to improve its relationship with the US. This is primarily based on wanting to improve defence cooperation. During the cold war, Turkey relied on the US for arms, funding and equipment, but was not able to use these weapons without US authorisation.

After 1989, Turkey carved out different markets for its weapons imports and faced US sanctions for buying S-400 surface-to-air missiles from Russia in 2020. Turkey would like to purchase F-35 supersonic fighter jets from the US, and is hoping that the US will move away from sanctioning third countries that have engaged with Russia.

Whose critical ally?

Turkey has made sure that it is not seen by the US as a junior partner in the Middle East region. For example, when Turkey launched operations in north-east Syria in 2019, where it repeatedly fired close to US forces, the US offered no military response.

The US sees Turkey as a key ally in spite of some different strategic goals. In addition to its geopolitical importance, Turkey also hosts US and Nato military forces at several of its bases and US nuclear weapons (20 B61 nuclear bombs) at its Incirlik Air Force Base.

Turkey now wants to expand its diplomatic and military footprint. As a member of the G20, with one of the 20 biggest economies in the world and the second largest and second most powerful military force in Nato after the US, it has a lot of power. And in geopolitical juggling, currently Turkey is in the luxurious position of everyone wanting Ankara to be on their side.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Senegal sees French troops depart as west Africa reassesses colonial ties,https://theconversation.com/senegal-sees-french-troops-depart-as-west-africa-reassesses-colonial-ties-251978,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 16:30:43 GMT","France has handed over control to the Senegalese government of two military bases in Senegal’s capital, Dakar that it has used for decades. The move follows an announcement in late 2024 by Senegal’s president, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, that all foreign troops would be required to leave the country.

“Senegal is an independent country, a sovereign nation, and sovereignty does not allow for the presence of foreign military bases,” Faye told Agence France-Presse in November.

Unlike in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, where military juntas have expelled French and American troops in recent years, this move comes from a democratically elected leader. Faye secured a decisive victory in Senegal’s 2024 presidential election and came to power despite efforts by the former president, Macky Sall, to extend his rule beyond constitutional limits.

Other democratic nations in west Africa seem to be reassessing their ties with western powers, too. The Ivory Coast, for example, has called for the end of its colonial-era military pact with France. And there are indications that US forces may soon be asked to leave Ghana.

The fact that democratically elected governments are taking a similar stance to military leaders in the region should prompt deeper reflection on the factors driving these decisions.

Younger generations of African leaders, shaped by decades of witnessing foreign-backed governments fail to boost development and security, are increasingly focused on decolonising their countries. This shift has also been driven by growing public awareness of the exploitation of Africa’s natural resources by some former colonial powers.

Some observers attribute these developments to disinformation campaigns targeting France and other western governments. But the reality is that foreign interventions and paternalistic policies in Africa have done little to benefit African populations.

Senegal’s push for sovereignty

To further distance itself from France, the Senegalese government plans to replace the CFA franc with a national currency. The CFA franc, which is controlled by the French treasury, is a currency used in 14 countries in west and central Africa. It gives French companies easier access to natural resources in African countries where it is used.

The move to replace it could test Senegal’s relationship with France. In 2019, when Italy’s former deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, raised concerns about the impact of the CFA franc on Africa’s development, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, dismissed the issue, stating: “I will not respond”.

Alongside economic reforms, Senegal is also reshaping its public spaces. It will soon begin renaming streets and landmarks that were previously associated with colonial figures. And the government wants to update school textbooks and create a department that will manage how Senegal’s national heritage is documented.

There is a broader regional movement to replace colonial-era street names. In Niger’s capital, Niamey, Avenue de Gaulle, named after the former French general and statesman, has been renamed Avenue Djibo Bakary after the city’s first post-independence mayor.

Similar efforts are underway in central Africa. In March 2025, a court ruling in Uganda mandated the removal of British colonial monuments and renaming streets that honour “crooks and historical figureheads”.

Among the figures affected include Maj. Gen. Henry Edward Colville, an early commissioner of the Uganda Protectorate, and Frederick Lugard, a key colonial administrator in Africa. Lugard also played a central role in creating Nigeria for British colonial rule.

Political shifts in the Sahel

A political shift seems to be taking place in Africa, particularly in the Sahel. In the 1960s, during the early years of African independence movements, many leaders from the continent took up arms against the colonial establishment.

This included Amílcar Cabral, leader of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde in Guinea-Bissau, as well as Nelson Mandela, who co-founded Umkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the African National Congress party in South Africa.

They were treated as threats to the colonial order, at least outside their own supporter base. Cabral was assassinated in 1973 by political rivals, with the alleged support of the Portuguese security establishment.

Nelson Mandela, who was imprisoned for 27 years by the South African apartheid regime he opposed, was on the US government’s terrorist list until 2008 despite being released from custody in 1993 and becoming the country’s first black president in 1994.

The rhetoric and actions of many military-led governments in the Sahel, along with some democratically elected leaders, echo those of Africa’s early independence movements. Like their predecessors, these leaders are often condemned by foreign governments, yet they appear to have growing support among people in the region.

Public rallies held by Captain Ibrahim Traoré in Burkina Faso regularly draw large crowds. The same is true for the military leaders in Niger. Traoré was even welcomed by cheering crowds during the recent inaugurations of democratically elected presidents in Senegal and Ghana.

This is an unusual reception for a leader who came to power through a military coup. Such moments reflect the sentiment of millions who see these leaders less as military rulers and more as symbols of resistance against foreign influence.

Some analysts have warned of instability following the expulsion of foreign troops from the Sahel. But decades of foreign military interventions have done little to improve security in the region. Counterinsurgency operations have not only failed to contain violence – the influence of insurgent groups has grown.

According to a February 2025 report by the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, the Sahel has been the epicentre of violence in Africa for four consecutive years. More than 10,000 deaths were attributed to militant Islamist violence in the region throughout 2024, with civilians being the primary targets.

Africa must take the lead in addressing its security and economic challenges, engaging with international partners on equal terms rather than as a passive participant. African leaders should prioritise security, education and development while opening dialogue with disaffected groups that feel excluded from political and economic opportunities.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Rivers are increasingly being given legal rights. Now they need people who will defend these rights in court,https://theconversation.com/rivers-are-increasingly-being-given-legal-rights-now-they-need-people-who-will-defend-these-rights-in-court-251736,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 13:11:13 GMT","A district council in England has passed a motion to grant its local river the rights to flow freely, to be free from pollution and to enjoy its native biodiversity. The move by Lewes District Council in East Sussex to recognise the fundamental rights of the River Ouse is the first of its kind in the UK.

The Ouse (not to be confused with larger rivers of the same name in Yorkshire and East Anglia) flows southwards for 35 miles into the English Channel and suffers from the usual problems afflicting many rivers in the UK: chemical pollution, sewage dumping and so on.

As a legal academic who researches exactly these sorts of rights, I was excited to see the news from Lewes (even if the council’s motions ultimately can’t overrule national laws). But simply granting a river some rights isn’t enough. We now need to think about who will actually defend these rights.

This may mean appointing someone to represent the rights of the river. Who these representatives are, and how they think about nature and conservation, can be as important as the granting of these rights in the first place.

Appointing representatives who care about their own personal and property interests would be a grave mistake, as would appointing anyone who prioritises the rights of humans to a healthy environment over a more intrinsic right of nature (remember: the idea is that the River Ouse has rights in itself and shouldn’t need to demonstrate its worth to humans).

As further rivers, lakes, forests and more are granted rights like the Ouse, we’ll need to train up an army of people willing to represent the rights of nature.

Natural entities should have legal rights

The law professor Christopher Stone pioneered the rights of nature concept back in the 1970s. He argued that natural entities, like rivers or forests, should have legal rights and that a “guardian” or representative should be appointed to defend those rights in court when they are threatened.

Some legal systems have adopted this model. For example, in New Zealand, the Whanganui River was granted legal personhood, and two “human faces” were appointed to act and speak on its behalf. Their duties are outlined in a 2017 act, which specifies that these representatives must have the skills, knowledge and experience needed to effectively advocate for the river’s rights.

But even as rights of nature are being considered in many countries, there is still little consideration of who will represent these rights effectively. For instance, back in 2008 Ecuador became the first country to grant the rights of nature in its constitution. However the constitution states that “all persons” are representatives of the rights of nature. This is simply impractical: we can’t expect every citizen to truly care about the rights of nature.

Efforts to apply the rights of nature in Ecuador have often failed. Legal challenges can become highly politicised and there is little legal infrastructure beyond general constitutional principles.

For example, in a case brought after road builders had dumped material into the Vilcabamba River, plaintiffs claimed to represent nature in court. However, they were not genuinely advocating for the river’s rights – their main concern was protecting their downstream property.

An ecocentric perspective

Ultimately, defending the rights of nature in court will be a struggle if the nature in question – the river, forest or lake – is not represented by someone with an ecocentric perspective. That means prioritising the intrinsic value of nature itself, rather than focusing on how it can serve human interests.

Ecocentric advocates have proved to be the most effective defenders of the rights of nature in many court cases. For example, in lawsuits involving Ecuador’s Los Cedros cloud forest and its marine ecosystems, ecocentric arguments helped secure stronger legal protections and even inspired the courts to grant further rights of nature.

One of the most common legal frameworks involves appointing “all persons”, “a person”, or “a resident” as representatives or protectors. For instance, Uganda’s National Environment Act 2019 states that anyone has the right to bring an action before a court “for any infringement of rights of nature”.

Similarly, the city of Toledo, Ohio, tried to introduce the Lake Erie bill of rights which stated that the city or any resident could act on behalf of the lake’s ecosystem. (The bill was declared unconstitutional by a federal court in 2020 and did not become the law).

Having such broad representation can make these legal protections less effective. This is what Stone, the law professor, envisioned back in the 70s: representatives should be trained to view nature as having intrinsic value – the very reason it is granted rights – and to protect it on that basis.

There are some promising examples. Guardians were appointed to protect the Magpie River in Canada, for instance, after it was granted legal personhood in 2022. Their responsibilities include participating – on behalf of the river itself – in any consultations on projects that might affect the river.

When the River Atrato in Colombia was also granted legal rights, the court required the formation of a commission (with representatives from the state and local communities) to train and oversee the work of the guardians.

Moves to give rights to nature are promising. But from Colombia to Canada to Sussex, we’ll need a whole army of nature protectors to actually enforce those rights.

The government has introduced a bill that would make it a criminal offence to conceal your identity at a protest.

The crime and policing bill establishes an offence if a person conceals their identity within a specifically designated area. That is, an area where the police believe that a protest is taking place, or is likely to take place, and that involves, or might involve, the “commission of offences” (people breaking the law).

These powers are preemptive and vague – how is the “likelihood” of a protest or offences determined? What specific “offences” does the bill refer to? What safeguards exist? Ultimately, the bill does not appear to place any real limits on the degree of discretion extended to the police.

The passage of this bill would have significant implications for the right to anonymity in public places. It is unparalleled among liberal democratic states, bringing UK practice into line with Russia, Hungary and China.

Under existing public order law, police already have the power to direct people to remove face coverings. The police justify these new powers on the basis that “individuals may follow the initial direction of the police officer to remove their face covering, but … move … and redeploy the face covering shortly afterwards.”

The bill continues the previous government’s attempts to erode the right to protest. It’s clear that the motivation for these laws is not concern for public safety, but a desire to significantly extend surveillance powers.

Facial recognition

Why is a ban on face coverings being introduced now? No significant new challenges to the policing of protest have emerged in recent decades. The difference now, however, is that facial recognition has recently become a viable policing technology.

As our forthcoming book details, facial recognition technology has rapidly transformed police surveillance capabilities, with profound effects on human rights, the formation of suspicion and on interactions between police and citizens.

Retrospective facial recognition (the use of facial recognition on recorded materials) is now used by every police force in the UK, and has been, in some cases, for more than a decade. This expansion occurred under the radar and without public debate. Its extent was only revealed through investigative journalism.

Live facial recognition, which involves real-time identity checks, is also expanding. South Wales Police recently deployed this technology across Cardiff’s pedestrian areas. And London’s Metropolitan Police are planning to install the first permanent live facial recognition cameras in the capital.

Being identified by police was once only a possibility, now it is a near certainty. The only rules currently governing the police’s use of facial recognition are developed by police forces themselves.

In recognition of the dangers posed by such surveillance, we were recently involved in developing, with the UN, a model protocol for law enforcement. It sets out practical guidance that all states should follow when policing protest, making clear that efforts to preserve one’s anonymity should not be treated as suspicious.

It explicitly prohibits the use of remote biometric technology, like facial recognition or retina scanning, to identify protesters during peaceful demonstrations – something we argue is inconsistent with police’s obligation to facilitate peaceful protest. This protocol was unanimously adopted by the 47 member states of the UN Human Rights Council.

Why the right to anonymity matters

The right to privacy, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are central to the health of a democratic society. This includes the ability to participate anonymously in protests.

But these rights are not absolute. This means that they can be limited – including in the interests of public safety or the prevention of crime and disorder – if doing so can be considered “necessary in a democratic society”. Given the importance of protest to democratic life, the threshold is high.

The purpose of protest is to disrupt. The fights for women’s right to vote, trade union recognition and racial equality are all examples where a degree of disruption and disorder has been an intrinsic part of political change. Human rights law requires that public authorities show a certain degree of tolerance in this regard.

To this end, human rights case law recognises that, no matter how shocking or “unacceptable”, any restrictions on freedom of expression and of assembly – other than in cases of incitement to violence, hate speech, or the rejection of democratic principles – risk undermining democracy itself.

There is strong research evidence that surveillance of protesters cultivates chilling effects, whereby individuals change their otherwise normal behaviour due to the fear of surveillance. As we explain, this generates compound human rights harms that may fundamentally undermine the ability of citizens to challenge the status quo.

With this proposed law, the UK is moving out of line with other democratic states and closer into step with Russia and China. Without changes, this bill risks transforming protests into surveillance opportunities.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Being hated worked for Just Stop Oil,https://theconversation.com/being-hated-worked-for-just-stop-oil-253379,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 16:30:36 GMT","The climate activist group Just Stop Oil (JSO) has announced the end of its campaign of direct action. Many will read the group’s legacy through the lens of public hostility: the frustration caused, the angry headlines, the outrage at its tactics. Not only have JSO activists been spat at, physically assaulted and run over by angry car drivers, but 15 members are also currently serving jail sentences following arrests and charges.

But the intense backlash directed at JSO is not evidence that its campaign faltered. It is a sign that these activists succeeded in emotionally charging the public debate about climate change. They gave the public something to argue about, react to, even mock — and in doing so, made the climate crisis impossible to ignore.

The alternative, an apathetic consensus, would entail passively accepting the dominant approach to address the climate crisis. That means market-based solutions, a faith in technological innovation, and incremental policy reforms within existing political and economic systems. These have arguably to date failed, as global temperatures continue to skyrocket.

Through my own research on climate activism, I have studied how environmental protest influences policy, corporate behaviour and financial markets. Activists can stimulate change, but not through rational arguments alone.

Change happens by making an emotional splash. It creates antagonism, dissent and tension, which are all needed to enliven public debate. Emotions including anger, fear and guilt play a key role in the ability of activists to create moral urgency and force issues into the spotlight.

JSO harnessed this emotional logic not only from supporters, but from critics. Those who dragged protesters off roads, raged in comment sections and professed their hate towards the group were reacting because the group had emotionally triggered them. Like a person who gets under your skin, JSO became very hard to ignore.

As business scholars Thomas Davenport and John Beck argue in their book The Attention Economy, in a saturated information landscape, being memorable — even disruptively — is a strategic advantage. In this sense, JSO “hacked” this logic by demanding emotional and cognitive attention, whether through support or outrage.

Disruptive protests may be unpopular, but they are effective at attracting media attention and public awareness. As many studies suggest, the more illogical or disruptive a protest, the more media coverage it receives — despite coverage not necessarily translating into more donations and support.

Of course, disruption risks alienating some people — but that can actually strengthen a movement’s overall influence. The “radical flank effect” shows that when radical activists push boundaries, they often make moderate voices in the same movement appear more reasonable. Recent research on JSO found that even when the group provoked public anger, support for moderate organisations such as Friends of the Earth increased.

This dynamic reflects what sociologist Thomas Roulet calls The Power of Being Divisive. Being controversial can actually benefit a cause by amplifying its message and deepening support from those already aligned. Polarisation, in this view, is not always harmful — it can be strategically useful. In the case of JSO activists, controversy did not dilute their message. Rather, it intensified its resonance with those already primed to act.

Turning emotion into action

JSO has also uniquely been able to provide direction for many struggling to navigate climate change’s volatile emotional context. As philosopher Glenn A. Albrecht describes in his book Earth Emotions, events such as climate change, mass species extinction and environmental degradation are creating a global emotional crisis, marked by a mix of grief, anxiety and powerlessness.

JSO has effectively tapped into this emotional turbulence, turning despair into urgency and action. Its actions can be seen as emotional interventions for a society struggling to process ecological loss.

Left undirected, emotions related to conditions such as climate change-related “eco-anxiety” can lead to paralysis – a state of emotional overwhelm that prevents people from taking meaningful action or engaging with the climate problem. But research shows that when movements channel emotions — especially by transforming fear into shared action — they build momentum. One study of climate organisers found that protest participation gave people a way to manage despair by reclaiming a sense of purpose and solidarity.

A frequent refrain is that the objectives are valid, but the strategies are too extreme. But history shows that disruptive tactics have long played a role in forcing attention to urgent issues. From the suffragettes chaining themselves to railings, to civil rights sit-ins, to ACT UP’s dramatic interventions during the Aids crisis — disruption has often preceded progress. Movements that are easy to ignore tend to be forgotten. JSO made itself, and its cause, impossible to ignore.

JSO’s campaign may be over, but the emotional legacy it leaves behind — frustration, urgency and debate — will outlast its tactics. The group exposed a society uneasy with the scale of change climate action demands, and showed that public anger is not a threat to activism, but a measure of its impact. If you were angry at them, that’s understandable — disruption is inconvenient. But the real question now is where we direct that energy: towards those resisting climate action, or those demanding we seriously do something about it.",theconversation

It will also include immersion in outdoor activities, and has support from the Natural History Museum, the Field Studies Council and the Wildlife Trusts.

However, while this will go some way to further bring sustainability and climate concerns into schools, the qualification is optional. It compartmentalises a subject that needs to be woven across the curriculum, so that every child is equipped to deal with the challenges we face and can appreciate that it impinges on every aspect of life.

In England, the whole national curriculum is under review. This provides a crucial opportunity to embed climate change and sustainability education throughout the curriculum. The independent review’s recent interim report identifies a need for a “greater focus on sustainability and climate science”.

It makes welcome reference to the need for the curriculum to keep pace with rapid social, environmental and technological change, and to equip young people to deal with future challenges.

This is in line with the findings of my research, with colleagues. We explored young people’s views of climate change education in secondary schools, carrying out a national survey of 1,000 14- to 18-year-olds and two follow-up in-depth workshops.

We found that young people consistently identified climate change as the top concern for their future lives, putting it above the cost of living crisis and young people’s mental health and wellbeing. Seven in ten teenagers told us they would welcome the opportunity to learn more about climate change in school. The same number thought climate change education should be included across all subjects.

Teach the Future, a youth-led organisation campaigning to improve education on the climate emergency and ecological crisis, published a shadow curriculum and assessment review interim report. These findings, gathered from the responses of over 500 young people, highlight the marginalisation of climate change and nature on the current English curriculum.

Woven through learning

Our research shows there needs to be a step change in how the education system prepares young people for a rapidly changing world. Engaging them meaningfully with the issues and practical solutions may motivate them to consider a green career.

In maths, for example, mathematical concepts could be introduced through calculating the effect of introducing solar panels on the school roof. Pupils could measure air quality, or calculate the carbon footprint of different food choices. The evidence suggests that a project-led approach, rooted in experiential learning locally relevant to the student, would be particularly effective.

Our report also found that current teaching on climate tends to focus narrowly on impacts and rarely on solutions. This may contribute to many young people’s sense of climate change anxiety, leaving them feeling demotivated and disenfranchised.

There is much that could be learnt from the approach taken by Scotland. Its learning for sustainability vision takes a cross-curricular, solutions-focused approach. Young people are often involved in creatively solving problems or finding solutions to questions that are meaningful to them.

Tools for understanding

My research suggests it is not enough for students to be taught facts and figures about climate change and biodiversity loss. They need to be provided with the critical thinking and media literacy skills to meaningfully engage with the issues.

There is much mis- and disinformation on climate circulating online. With the rise of artificial intelligence, the distinction between fact and fiction is becoming increasingly difficult to discern. An emphasis on media literacy and critical thinking skills would help young people generate and evaluate ideas for tackling the crisis.

Overhauling and refreshing England’s current curriculum and assessment system will not be easy. Even if climate change is increasingly included, this still may take place too slowly.

The interim report makes clear that the intention is to continue “with our ‘evolution not revolution’ approach”, which will inform the final report to be published this autumn. However, there is an urgent need to act quickly if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,My documentary Motherboard follows my first 21 years of motherhood – these films about single mums inspired me,https://theconversation.com/my-documentary-motherboard-follows-my-first-21-years-of-motherhood-these-films-about-single-mums-inspired-me-253059,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 13:11:10 GMT","On a warm and sunny May bank holiday in 2003, I had one of those rare days that truly changes your life forever. I sat in my bathroom, hands shaking as two pink lines emerged on the pregnancy test I was holding.

I was 38, single and broke. This pregnancy was the result of a brief relationship which had only amounted to four dates. Shell-shocked as I was, I laughed out loud in a moment of joy I knew there was no coming back from. Nine months later I gave birth to my son Jim.

My old Nokia still holds the text thread of the three years I was in touch with Jim’s dad. My messages began “I had a great time last night”, and ended “Have you got the results yet?” He had requested a paternity test when Jim was two. A week later we both received the results. The probability that he was Jim’s biological dad was 99.99%. This news prompted a final reply from Jim’s dad: “Yes, I got the results … I’m moving to Spain.”

We didn’t hear from him again for over a decade. Unable to combine motherhood with my previous career as a TV director, I quit my job overnight. I got a job teaching filmmaking and was out of the film industry for over a decade.

I began filming my son Jim as he grew up. I recorded hundreds of hours of footage, capturing each twist and turn in Jim’s life, from the thumbs-up he gave me during my first scan, to his first day at college.

Jim is 21 now. Filmed over 20 years, my feature documentary Motherboard charts the highs and lows of solo motherhood. It explores how Jim and I navigated him meeting his dad for the first time at 13, closely followed by my breast cancer diagnosis and Jim’s party-hard late teens, when tempers frayed and doors slammed.

When I was making Motherboard I burnt through any books, films and TV that I could find, exploring solo motherhood. Many repeated the same old tabloid cliches and movie tropes of single mums. They were victims or martyrs, their only moment of joy watching the sun set over their estate before the bailiffs turned up.

In I’ll Show Myself Out: Essays on Midlife and Motherhood (2022), author and comic Jessi Klein writes that: “Motherhood as a story, is so infrequently told, because the world tells us that what mothers do is unremarkable and unimportant.” She goes on to explore the structure of the hero’s epic journey in Hollywood blockbusters, in which the (usually male) hero embarks on a quest and returns home transformed.

Klein turns this formula on its head. “Motherhood is a hero’s journey, it’s not a journey outwards to the most fantastic, farest-flung places, but a journey inwards, downwards to the deepest parts of your strength.”

My own film, Motherboard, and several of the films that inspired me, follow the trope of the hero’s journey. But the key difference is that the director is often the hero and the author of her own story. The following films and TV series capture the pain, happiness, chaos and comedy of the hero’s journey that is motherhood.

1. Lollipop (2024)

Director Daisy-May Hudson recently developed her own experiences of being homeless with her mum and younger sister into her feature drama debut. Lollipop tells the story of Molly, a young single mum who loses custody of her kids after a short stay in prison. The joy of the film is that it’s the polar opposite to the broken single mums we see in Ken Loach’s Ladybird, Ladybird (1994) and Cathy Come Home (1966).

In Hudson’s entirely female cast, Molly and her best mate Amina are fierce single mums who transform the obstacles they face into laugh-out-loud moments of comedy. These are single mums that are flawed, impulsive, powerful, funny and, most importantly, believable.

2. Better Things (2016)

Better Things is a TV series, written by and starring Pamela Adlon, based on her own experiences of being a single mum to her three teenage daughters in LA. There’s a great scene in the final series where Adlon’s character, Sam, is being examined by her doctor who asks her if she’s stressed out because she has “too many errands to run”.

She replies:

“No, no. Errands are, like, groceries and going to the post office, it’s the real mum stuff … Soccer club sign-ups and dance classes and tutors and tuition payments and parent-teacher conferences and schools and camps that I have to get them into, mean girl issues with my youngest at school and birth control with my oldest and cruelty from my middle daughter. And then there’s my own mom, who is driving me nuts … And I am definitely going through menopause. So, yeah, Dr. Babu, it’s, like – it’s a lot.”

3. Boyhood (2014)

Richard Linklater’s Boyhood often comes up when critics are reviewing Motherboard. It’s a film I love. Filmed over a decade, it depicts the childhood and adolescence of Mason Evans (played by Ellar Coltrane).

“I always described it as a film about growing up”, Linklater told the Guardian, “But it’s also a film about parenting”. Linklater was probably the first director I encountered whose character of a single mum (played by Patricia Arquette) felt real to me.

Patronising empowerment

I listened to a podcast recently in which Adlon challenged the words that are often used to describe Better Things. “Brave”, “raw” and “vulnerable” come up constantly.

Critics and audiences often tell me that I’m brave. It can feel condescending. I’ve never heard the word attributed to Linklater’s Boyhood. What sets myself and Adlon apart from Linklater, is that we are both single mothers ourselves.

As politicians continue to obsess over the recent statistic that “more boys have smartphones than dads”, families with absent fathers will continue to be seen as tragic and flawed. But single mothers are not a problem to be solved. Lollipop, Better Things and Motherboard are all proof of Klein’s belief that “a mother’s heroic journey is not about how she leaves … but about how she stays”.",theconversation

The drama joins an growing array of TV shows and films exploring similar ideas.

In Apple TV’s compelling drama Silo, civilisation has resorted to living and working deep in an underground storage facility as a means to protect humanity from the wasteland above.

Michelle and Barack Obama’s Netflix thriller Leave The World Behind depicts the US facing chaos and unrest as a cybersecurity attack takes down the country’s entire technological infrastructure, leading to catastrophic scenes of fallen cities on fire.

Similar tropes appear in Zero Day, starring Rober De Niro as a former president tasked with finding out who is behind a cyber attack that has resulted in the deaths of thousands of people.

And then there is The End, a climate-crisis musical starring Tilda Swinton that dips into the strange world of a wealthy family living deep underground in a luxurious bunker, decades after an environmental catastrophe has hit the earth.

Dystopian dramas are clearly in vogue right now, but films and TV dramas have often reflected the fears and anxieties of their times. A Clockwork Orange (1971) portrayed the class conflict and wanton violence of the 1970s. TV series Threads (1984) tapped into fears of a nuclear attack. Ghost in the Shell (1995) focused on identity in an increasingly technology-obsessed world. And Children of Men (2006) centred on the bleak terror of a world without children.

More recently, The Walking Dead (2010 onwards) focused on what it means to cling onto humanity in an unrelenting world, while Squid Game (2021-) is a dystopian reflection of capitalism exploring the circumstances that drive desperate people to participate in a deadly competition for money.

My research explores cultural aspects of consumption and one of my research interests is forms of escapism, mainly provided by films, television and video games. A question that sometimes arises is whether we actually desire dystopia.

Well, streaming giants might argue it’s good for business. Zero Day has remained in Netflix’s top-ten chart for the past month, Apple has renewed Silo for two more seasons, and Disney just ordered a second season of Paradise. The third and final season of Squid Game will air in June – previous seasons have broken Netflix records for downloads and views.

This trend for dystopian movies and TV shows underscores the public appetite for this content, despite its alarmingly prescient feel and tone. Paradoxically, this seems to starkly contrast with the notion that people turn to video games, movies and boxset binges to escape the mundanity of everyday life and the wearisome realities that we must contend with.

In my research with colleagues at Lancaster University, we explored these issues: when reality is disrupted in some unexpected way, our beliefs and assumptions about how we think the world should operate are challenged.

Drawing on interviews, we explored participants’ experiences of bingeing TV shows against a backdrop of changing real-world events and the impact these changes had on their ability to suspend their disbelief. The people we spoke to turned to culture for a sense-making escape.

Escapism here is less about feeling abandoned and more about a search for hope and rediscovering the coordinates for our existence. Dystopian narratives might provide some food for thought: how would we cope if the apocalyptic events portrayed on screen were to really occur?

TV dramas like Zero Day and films like Leave the World Behind identify and zoom in on the terrors and anxieties of the present: AI and the “rise of the machine”, war and global instability, profound inequality, disinformation, online hostility and cyber threats. However, in doing so, these dramas can also exemplify what might be required to transform or alter a dystopian reality, meaning as viewers we engage in a form of “critical dystopia”.

Our appetite for dystopian narratives could derive from the idea that we never imagine ourselves to be the subject of some major catastrophic event. In a discussion about dystopia, critical marketing academics Alan Bradshaw, James Fitchett and Joel Hietanen explored how we often equate dystopian events and imaginings as happening to others, not necessarily us.

This is aided by the fact that we often occupy the role of a distant onlooker, not the perspective of someone living under the catastrophic events being portrayed.

Bradshaw, Fitchett and Hietanen argue that much of our everyday existence consists of fairly mundane encounters and repetitive experiences. As an antidote to this safe ordinariness, we are drawn to extreme versions of life, and harbour repressed fantasies and desires of destruction and catastrophe. So we indulge in dystopian desires and impulses, albeit at a distance or vicariously through video games, movies, books and TV shows from the comfort of our sofas.

Finally, some people seem to find a sense of enjoyment in imagining their own ruin – what is described as a “death drive”, that simultaneously contradicts yet co-exists with self-preservation instincts. Philosopher and cultural theorist Slavoj Žižek suggests that there are people who derive pleasure from dystopian narratives, fascinated at the prospect of their own annihilation.

However, through optimistic endings, dystopian dramas imply that we may be able to intervene, prevent or even reverse the alarming consequences. We then indulge in fantasies of a new utopia in an attempt to return to our known reality, or receive a prophetic nudge in the direction of a more improved world to replace the dystopia.

In this case, viewers of edge-of-your-seat dramas like Zero Day and Paradise search for hope and relief, and as detached observers fantasise about how catastrophe and self-annihilation can be paused or even better, averted.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,The UK has a lot of people out of work because of mental illness – but listening to those affected reveals that’s rarely the whole story,https://theconversation.com/the-uk-has-a-lot-of-people-out-of-work-because-of-mental-illness-but-listening-to-those-affected-reveals-thats-rarely-the-whole-story-252891,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 13:11:08 GMT","What is going on in the UK when it comes to the massive rise in benefit claims related to mental health? It’s complicated, that much is certain.

Understanding the causes of mental health-related economic inactivity and what to do about it is at the top of the UK government’s policy agenda. It recently set out plans in a green paper to improve access to effective employment support for people with mental health problems. At the same time, controversial reforms to health and disability benefits were central to Chancellor Rachel Reeves’s spring statement.

As a social researcher, listening closely to people’s lived experiences has taught me that while their distress is genuine, significant and at times severe, it is rarely the whole story of what is constraining their ability to find and stay in work.

Mental distress is almost invariably bound up in other challenging circumstances that also pose barriers to work – issues such as homelessness, violence and abuse, caring commitments, lone parenthood, poverty, involvement with the criminal justice system, and the obstacles caused by inflexible employers and insecure work.

This has made me wonder if the system’s very narrow focus on health as a barrier to work is part of the problem.

It’s not that the mental health conversation has gone too far – but it may have become too narrow. While it is essential to respond to people’s distress, we can’t understand their capacity for work, or support their steps back into employment, unless we pay attention to all the other factors that limit their opportunities for work.

The work capability assessment (WCA) was introduced 17 years ago to determine how far and in what ways someone’s disability, illness or health condition limits them from working. Since then, welfare support has been narrowed down to questions of obligation and conditionality – with health as the central focus.

But this narrow approach, and the exclusive link between ill health and work-related obligations, has crowded out the full range of challenges, constraints and contingencies that affect people’s capacity for work. When health is the only thing the system is interested in, it’s the only thing claimants can discuss.

So now, with the UK government’s plan to scrap the WCA and introduce a new kind of “support conversation”, there is an opportunity to bring this broader range of factors back into the picture.

In a positive shift, the government has recognised that discussions about work need to include a better understanding of people’s goals and aspirations, and that these conversations should also facilitate access to support for debt, housing, careers, training and social connection.

How this might be done is a question that needs careful thought and experimentation. The government is seeking responses on how this “support conversation” should be designed and delivered.

In a recent workshop, we explored the opportunities and challenges that might arise from a more holistic approach to assessing capacity for work. Participants in our workshop felt there was potential for more positive experiences and effective support.

But they also envisaged risks both for claimants and welfare services, including the potential for claimants to be retraumatised, as well as extra admin and the possibility of raising unrealistic expectations.

Better support for people who want to work

As the government’s Pathways to Work green paper recognises, there are many people for whom formal paid employment may never be possible. But there are some people in the health-related benefits group who would like to work.

In my most recent research project, I met people living with mental health difficulties and neurodivergence who were keen to work but felt frustrated at the lack of personalised support. Here are a few examples of what they told me:

In my experience, they don’t help you, they just tell you to do this, that and the other. But they’re not supporting you through the process of finding a job. They’re just throwing these jobs at you. (female, 26) I do want to work. It’s just, I want to be able to work and then keep the job. And right now, I just I don’t feel like I’ve got the right things in place to help me with that … I don’t want to use it as just an excuse … What I want is: ‘Oh, I’ve got ADHD, can you please take that into account?’ (male, 33) I really don’t know what [job] to go for … A lot of my issues have been connected to frustration and feeling stuck, and not being able to find a pathway into sustainable employment – and things related to education. It’s all kind of linked in a bundle (male, 38)

Shifting the balance towards personalised and holistic support is a step in the right direction. But the spectre of welfare conditionality, and the threat of sanctions if someone is unable to fulfil work-related activities, will always be a block on engaging those who might be able to work, given the appropriate time and support.

While the green paper describes sanctions as a “last resort”, it does not go far enough on removing compliance from people’s encounters with the system.

The goal should be to make a safe space for people to go beyond the health conversation. The new “support conversation” must allow people to talk about their health and non-health constraints, and the full range of support they need to move into appropriate work.

We do need to talk about mental health – the reality of people’s distress must never be undermined. But we need to talk about more than just mental health, and approach people’s work-related challenges with an appreciation that mental health problems rarely arise out of nowhere. We cannot understand capacity for work without understanding people’s wider social context.

Lastly, we really need to ditch the “any job” approach. It is the fit of a particular workplace and particular job with a person’s unique life circumstances that makes the difference as to whether work is feasible, fulfilling and sustainable.",theconversation

The remarkable successes of the decades-old partnership between biomedical research institutions and the federal government are so intertwined with daily life that it’s easy to take them for granted.

However, the scientific work driving these medical advances and breakthroughs is in jeopardy. Federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation are terminating hundreds of active research grants under the current administration’s direction. The administration has also proposed a dramatic reduction in federal support of the critical infrastructure that keeps labs open and running. Numerous scientists and health professionals have noted that changes will have far-reaching, harmful outcomes for the health and well-being of the American people.

The negative consequences of defunding U.S. biomedical research can be difficult to recognize. Most breakthroughs, from the basic science discoveries that reveal the causes of diseases to the development of effective treatments and cures, can take years. Real-time progress can be hard to measure.

As biomedical researchers studying infectious diseases, viruses and immunology, we and our colleagues see this firsthand in our own work. Thousands of ongoing national and international projects dedicated to uncovering the causes of life-threatening diseases and developing new treatments to improve and save lives are supported by federal agencies such as the NIH and NSF.

Considering a few of the breakthroughs made possible through U.S. federal support can help illustrate not only the significant inroads biomedical research has made for preventing, treating and curing human maladies, but what all Americans stand to lose if the U.S. reduces its investment in these endeavors.

A cure for cancer

The hope and dream of curing cancer unites many scientists, health professionals and affected families across the U.S. After decades of ongoing NIH-supported research, scientists have made significant progress in realizing this goal.

The National Cancer Institute of the NIH is the world’s largest funder of cancer research. This investment has led to advances in cancer treatment and prevention that helped reduce the overall U.S. cancer death rate by 33% from 1991 to 2021.

Basic science research on what causes cancer has led to new strategies to harness a patient’s own immune system to eliminate tumors. For example, all 12 patients in a 2022 clinical trial testing one type of immunotherapy had their rectal cancer completely disappear, without remission or adverse effects.

Another example of progress is the 2024 results of an ongoing clinical trial of a targeted therapy for lung cancer, showing an 84% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death. Similarly, in a study of women who were immunized against the human papillomavirus at age 12 or 13, none developed the disease later. Since the widespread adoption of HPV vaccination, cervical cancer deaths have dropped 62%.

Despite these incredible successes, there is still a long way to go. In 2024, over 2 million people in the U.S. were estimated to be newly diagnosed with cancer, and 611,720 were expected to die from the disease.

Without sustained federal support for cancer research, progress toward curing cancer and reducing its death rate will stall.

Autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases

Nearly every family is touched in some way by autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. Government-funded research has enabled major advances to combat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease.

For example, approximately 1 in 5 Americans have arthritis, an autoimmune disease that causes joint swelling and stiffness. A leading cause of disability and economic costs in the U.S., there is no cure for arthritis. But new drugs in development are able to significantly improve symptoms and slow or prevent disease progression.

Researchers are also gaining insight into what causes multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the protective covering of nerves and can result in paralysis. Scientists recently found a link between multiple sclerosis and Epstein-Barr virus, a pathogen estimated to infect over 90% of adults around the world. While multiple sclerosis is currently incurable, identifying its underlying cause can provide new avenues for prevention and treatment.

Alzheimer’s disease causes irreversible nerve damage and is the leading cause of dementia. In 2024, 6.9 million Americans ages 65 and older were living with Alzheimer’s. Most treatments address cognitive and behavioral symptoms. However, two new drugs developed with NIH-supported research and clinical trials were approved in July 2023 and July 2024 to treat early-stage Alzheimer’s. Federal funding is also supporting the development of blood tests for earlier detection of the disease.

None of these breakthroughs are a cure. But they represent important steps forward on the path toward ultimately reducing or eliminating these devastating ailments. Lack of funding will slow or block further progress, leading to the continued rise of the incidence and severity of these conditions.

Infectious diseases and the next pandemic

The world’s capacity to combat infectious disease will also be weakened by cuts to U.S. federal support of biomedical research.

Over the past 50 years, medical and public health advances have led to the eradication of smallpox globally and the elimination of polio in the U.S. HIV/AIDS, once a death sentence, is now a disease that can be managed with medication. Moreover, a new version of treatments called preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, offers complete protection against HIV transmission when taken only twice per year.

Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the critical role biomedical research plays in responding to public health threats. Increased federal support of science during this time allowed the United States to emerge with new drugs, vaccine platforms with the potential to treat a variety of chronic diseases, and insights on how to effectively detect and respond to pandemic threats.

The ongoing avian influenza outbreak and its spillover into American dairy herds and poultry farms is another pandemic threat looming on the horizon. Rather than build upon infrastructure for outbreak surveillance and preparedness, grants that would allow scientists to better understand long COVID-19, vaccines and other pandemic-related research are being cut. Decreased funding of biomedical research will hamper the U.S.’s ability to respond to the next pandemic, putting everyone at risk.

Losses from defunding biomedical research

The National Institutes of Health contributed over $100 billion to support research that ultimately led to the development of all new drugs approved from 2010 to 2016 alone. Over 90% of this funding was for basic research into understanding the causes of disease that provides the foundation for new treatments.

Under the new directive to eliminate projects that support or use terms associated with diversity, equity and inclusion, the NIH and other federal agencies have made deep cuts to biomedical research that will directly affect patient lives.

Already, nearly 41% of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime, and nearly 11% with Alzheimer’s. About 1 in 5 Americans will die from heart disease, and nearly 1.4 million will be rushed to an emergency room due to pneumonia from an infectious disease.

Defunding biomedical research will result in a cascade of effects. There will likely be fewer clinical trials, fewer new treatments and fewer lifesaving drugs. Labs will likely shut down, jobs will be lost, and the process of discovery will stall. The U.S.’s health care system, economy and standing as the world’s leader in scientific innovation will likely decline.

Moreover, when the pipelines of scientific progress are turned off, they will not so easily be turned back on. These consequences will affect all Americans and the rest of the world for decades.

University shortfalls directly resulting from cuts to research support will dramatically reduce the capacity of American institutions to educate and provide opportunities for the next generation. Funding cuts have led to the shuttering or heavy reduction of training programs for future scientists.

Graduate students and postdoctoral trainees are the lifeblood of biomedical research. Supporting these young people committed to public service through research and health care is also an investment in medical advancements and public health. But the uncertainty and instability resulting from the divestment of federally funded programs will likely severely deplete the biomedical workforce, crippling the United States’ ability to deliver future biomedical breakthroughs.

By cutting biomedical research funding, Americans and the rest of the world stand to lose new cures, new treatments and an entire generation of researchers.",theconversation

What’s more, that finding remains true no matter the person’s race, gender, age, education, income, weight, language, immigration status or where they live.

These are the key takeaways from our recent study, published in JAMA Network Open.

Everyday discrimination refers to the routine ways people are treated unfairly because of characteristics such as skin color, perceived background or general appearance.

Generally, it means disrespectful treatment: waiting longer than others for help at a store, having your ideas dismissed without consideration at work, or hearing rude comments about your identity.

Although marginalized groups endure everyday discrimination most often, our study indicates that this is a widespread issue affecting people of all races and backgrounds.

I’m a professor who specializes in community health. My team and I analyzed data from the 2023 National Health Interview Survey, which included a weighted sample of nearly 30,000 U.S. adults, adjusted to accurately reflect more than 258 million people – approximately 75% of the country.

Along with reporting frequency of everyday discrimination, participants completed clinical screenings for depression and anxiety.

The results were striking: Nearly 56% of participants experienced at least occasional everyday discrimination, with 3.6% having “high levels,” meaning they faced discrimination most frequently – at least monthly and often weekly.

High levels were most prevalent among Black adults, at 8.6%. Multiracial respondents were next with 6.4%. Hispanics and white participants were at about 3%, Asians just over 2%.

Women and immigrants, people with disabilities and those who are overweight, obese or struggling with food insecurity also reported higher levels.

When compared with those reporting no discrimination, participants with high levels had five times the odds of screening positive for either depression or anxiety, and nearly nine times the odds of screening positive for both.

As discrimination increased, the increase in screening positive for depression, anxiety or both varied by race, with a more noticeable rise among groups that are often overlooked in these discussions – white, Asian and multiracial adults.

This doesn’t mean discrimination is less harmful for Black, Hispanic/Latino or other racial and ethnic groups. One possible reason for our study’s findings may be that groups that have long endured structural discrimination may have developed more ways over time to cope with it.

Why it matters

At some point, all of us experience unfair treatment due to our personal traits. But this type of discrimination isn’t just unpleasant. Our study shows it has real consequences for health.

Along with depression and anxiety, discrimination creates chronic stress, leading to increased risk for hypertension, heart disease, impaired brain functioning, accelerated aging and premature death.

For some, everyday discrimination may emerge at different times in life. This can happen to people as they get older or when they become ill.

But for others, it is a constant. This includes people living in marginalized communities, people of color, those socioeconomically disadvantaged or with disabilities, or those who identify as LGBTQ+.

What other research is being done

Multiracial people are uniquely challenged because they navigate multiple racial identities. This often leads to feelings of isolation, which increases mental health risks.

White adults, though less frequently exposed to racial discrimination, still face mistreatment, particularly if they have lower incomes, limited education or working-class backgrounds. In recent years, white people have perceived rising levels of discrimination against their own group.

People of Asian descent are vulnerable to societal pressures and harmful stereotypes, which spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic.

When factors are combined – for example, adding financial insecurity or immigration status to racism – compounded health challenges arise.

What’s next

Understanding how discrimination affects health for all can lead to policies and programs targeting root causes of mental health disparities and the rising rates of depression and anxiety.

Discrimination isn’t just a Black versus white issue. It’s a public health crisis affecting all Americans. Acknowledging its harmful health effects is a first step.

https://quantamagazine.org,The High Cost of Quantum Randomness Is Dropping,https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-high-cost-of-quantum-randomness-is-dropping-20250328/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Nothing is certain in the quantum realm. A particle, for example, can exist in multiple quantum states simultaneously. The same goes for a quantum bit, or qubit — the basic unit of information used in quantum computing. The act of measurement causes these objects to collapse into a single state, and usually the best you can do is calculate the probability of a particular outcome.

The unpredictability at the heart of the quantum realm has been immensely useful for computing and cryptography, where experts have learned to harness randomness as a tool. But as useful as it is for quantum circuits to incorporate true randomness, it’s a difficult state to achieve, with steep costs. “Generating randomness is pretty expensive,” said William Kretschmer, a researcher at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing who studies quantum complexity.

As a result, quantum researchers have long wanted to see if they could possibly fake that randomness. They wanted to build “pseudorandom” quantum circuits, which seem to be truly random but can nonetheless be constructed relatively simply and manageably. The only problem was that no one knew if it was possible to actually build one.

After years of uncertainty, two researchers posted a paper last October that proved that it is in fact possible to construct such a circuit. Their work provides an elegant and secure way to represent quantum randomness that’s indistinguishable from the real thing, without the enormous computational load — though it’s only possible in a world where some basic theoretical assumptions of cryptography are correct. The proof could open new doors for quantum computing and cryptography research.

“Before this recent result on pseudorandom [circuits], we didn’t have good evidence that they actually exist,” said Alexander Poremba, a quantum computing researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved with the new paper. Now, “for the first time, we have very good evidence that pseudorandomness is a real concept.”

Randomness to Order

Traditionally, researchers who want to represent randomness in their quantum computations have needed to keep track of every possible configuration of a quantum state. They’ve done the bookkeeping using a mathematical object called a Haar-random unitary, named after the Hungarian mathematician Alfréd Haar. These are thorough descriptions, and in the case of qubits, the possibilities grow exponentially. So while a Haar-random unitary for a few qubits is straightforward, one taking 25 qubits into account would require well over a quadrillion data points. Such complexity far exceeds the capabilities of classical and quantum computers.

Fermi Ma helped develop a way to make randomness more accessible, using something called a pseudorandom unitary. Xinyu Tan

Rather than going through the hassle of trying to generate such complexity, researchers have long believed it was possible to simulate this state with something called a pseudorandom unitary, or PRU. This would work just like a Haar-random state, but in a neat and efficient manner.

Pseudorandomness has long been a foundational concept in computer science, but excitement around its use in applications for quantum systems reached new heights in 2017. That year, a paper introduced the concept of a PRU and suggested a possible method for constructing one, but the authors fell short of proving that it would be indistinguishable from a Haar-random unitary. Part of that paper’s logic assumed the existence of something called a one-way function. Put simply, this is a mathematical function that is easy to compute moving forward in time, but extremely difficult to compute in the opposite direction. It’s the mathematical equivalent of a drop of ink spreading through a glass of water: easy to put in, nearly impossible to reverse. These functions are essential for cryptography; most proofs in the field tend to assume they exist.

Subsequent papers from early last year proved the existence of similar but weaker variants of PRUs. That’s where things stood when Simons Institute colleagues Fermi Ma and Robert Huang decided to tackle the problem. They used a principle common from quantum information theory known as “purification,” which allows you to analyze a random quantum system as though it’s a smaller part of a larger system in a fixed quantum state — one that behaves predictably moving both forward and backward in time. Drawing inspiration from a seminal 1984 paper about pseudorandom functions, Ma and Huang also developed a simpler and more efficient way to simulate Haar-random unitaries, which they called a “path-recording simulation.”

“It felt like we were trying something radically different, just ignoring all of the [recent] literature entirely, and saying, ‘What could we do to analyze this from the ground up?’” Ma said.

Robert Huang, together with Ma, came up with a new way to simulate quantum randomness called a “path-recording simulation.” ChiYun Cheng

Once they hit upon this strategy, Ma and Huang worked out their proof in a matter of weeks. They proved that one of the previously proposed constructions for a weaker version of a PRU was in fact a fully-fledged PRU, thus showing that PRUs really do exist assuming the existence of one-way functions. As a bonus, they also proved the existence of “strong” PRUs, which are indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries even to certain powerful algorithms.

“We’re all extremely excited — it’s fantastic to solve an open question,” Huang said. “But this also leads to a huge number of implications.”

Practical Possibilities

Assuming those one-way functions really exist, Ma and Huang’s proof suggests new experimental possibilities for quantum computing and cryptography. In 2019, Google announced it had achieved “quantum supremacy,” a landmark achievement in which a quantum computer performs a calculation that can’t be matched by any classical computer. That research was based on efforts to simulate quantum Haar-random states. The new proof for the construction of PRUs could enable similar experiments in the future at a fraction of the computational cost. These constructions are “actually very important for quantum technology as a whole,” Huang said. “We can [now] do these quantum-advantage experiments using much more efficient resources.”

The proof could also provide physicists with a new method for studying black holes. These complicated objects function as natural information scramblers, so researchers have often modeled them using Haar-random unitaries. But the exponential complexity of these models doesn’t seem to conform with the behavior of black holes, which appear to scramble information very quickly. Physicists have therefore begun to wonder whether black holes might in fact just seem random, while actually emerging from a relatively simple process — in other words, they could be more like pseudorandom unitaries. Now that an explicit proof for the construction of PRUs exists, physicists can start probing that question more directly.

“The lines between physics and computation are becoming much more blurry,” said Poremba, who was a co-author on one of the early 2024 PRU papers.

For Kretschmer, the real significance of Ma and Huang’s proof is that it marks a step toward reconciling classical theory with quantum theory. “It’s telling us how to build pseudorandom unitaries, which are fundamentally quantum objects, from one-way functions, which are classical objects,” he said. “This is the bridge that’s being built.”

https://undark.org,Book Review: The Dazzling Complexity of the Frozen World,https://undark.org/2025/03/28/book-review-ends-of-the-earth/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","It’s an iconic image: A polar bear perched on a lone ice cap, drifting at sea. Is that the fate climate change has in store for this powerful Arctic inhabitant? In 2004, the discovery of a fossil polar bear jaw on Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago, suggested another possibility. The fossil came from a bear that had lived between 110,000 and 130,000 years ago, an era that was warm — even warmer than today.

But studies of the genome extracted from the fossil showed the ancient bear had much greater genetic diversity than modern polar bears. Scientists hypothesized that when ice diminished in previous millennia, polar bears moved to land and interbred with brown bears, whose genes could have helped them adapt to the warmer weather. With possibly fewer genetic resources, today’s polar bears may not fare as well.

BOOK REVIEW — “Ends of the Earth: Journeys to the Polar Regions in Search of Life, the Cosmos, and Our Future,” by Neil Schubin (Dutton, 288 pages).

That’s one of the many unexpected discoveries covered in “Ends of the Earth: Journeys to the Polar Regions in Search of Life, the Cosmos, and Our Future,” the latest book by paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Neil Shubin. And the tenuous fate of the polar bear hints at the question at the heart of his narrative: What is it about the polar regions that seems so important to our understanding of the environment — and ourselves?

Although polar regions only make up 8 percent of the total surface of the Earth, their influence is far greater than one might expect. “Almost 70 percent of all the planet’s fresh water is frozen in ice,” Shubin writes. “On land, permafrost in the polar regions holds 1,600 billion tons of carbon — roughly double that in the entire atmosphere today.”

“Locked in the soils and ice of the poles are clues to our past and things that will shape our planetary future,” he continues. “Every milestone of human evolution, from the origin of our species to the establishment of our social structures and technologies, arose during a time of ice at the poles.”

Shubin, a professor at the University of Chicago who has spent decades leading expeditions in the Arctic and Antarctica, is the author of popular science books like “Some Assembly Required: Decoding Four Billion Years of Life, from Ancient Fossils to DNA” and “Your Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body.” But he might be best known for his 2004 discovery of Tiktaalik, a 375-million-year-old fossil unearthed in the Canadian Arctic that is considered to be an important evolutionary link between fish and humans.

“Locked in the soils and ice of the poles are clues to our past and things that will shape our planetary future.”

In his new book, Shubin brings the polar world to life through a combination of travel and immersive science writing. He takes the reader to Antarctica, Canada, Norway, and laboratories around the world, talking to scientists in fields ranging from paleoclimatology to geology to engineering. Along the way, Shubin explores the adaptations plants and animals needed to survive in harsh polar climates, what topographical changes can tell us about our world, and the stories the ice tells through meteorites embedded in it over millions of years. It’s also the story of polar exploration: the techniques and tools that have evolved and been fine-tuned over time, including those developed by Indigenous communities.

And finally, it’s the story of the environment itself, in particular the fragility of the poles and the profound changes to these landscapes due to global warming. Shubin writes, for example, about the impact of hundreds of wildfires that broke out in Siberia in 2021: “These so-called zombie fires were the rekindled remains of fires from the previous year,” he writes. “With carbon-rich peat underground, the fires had smoldered for months under the ice.”

Though the Arctic is usually free of thunderstorms and the lightning that can spark wildfires, “the incidents of summer lightning in the Arctic have tripled” since 2010, he writes. “In recent years, lightning even has struck within 60 miles of the North Pole.” The region’s increasing temperatures, it seems, are fueling more frequent and longer storms.

The first chapter, titled “ICE IS HOT,” takes its name from an explanation given to Shubin by Sridhar Anandakrishnan, a glacial expert, during an expedition to McMurdo Station in Antarctica. Water can be a solid, liquid, or gas on a fairly narrow temperature spectrum, he was told, and “because of the physics of the molecule, ice is hot in terms of the temperature required to melt it into a liquid,” especially compared to other materials, like steel. And because ice under high pressure melts at even lower temperatures, the bottom layer of a glacier “is right on the cusp of melting.”

The constantly changing nature of ice is a theme returned to repeatedly. Glacial ice can be more than one thing at a time in various places: part liquid, part solid; it can melt, bend, refreeze, and even act like a gel. It defies simple explanations, and Shubin notes that the Inuktitut language uses different combinations of words and phrases to describe various properties and characteristics of ice.

He explores the astonishing variety of plants, insects, and animals that have adapted to polar temperatures. Arthur DeVries, for example, a University of Illinois physiologist who worked at McMurdo Station in the 1960s, found a fascinating protein in the blood of icefish. This protein had a structure that could bind to ice crystals to prevent them from growing and damaging cells. When he and his colleagues sequenced the protein, they found it was almost identical to a digestive protein in the fish’s liver. “With a few small mutations over time, this liver protein was repurposed into an antifreeze in the ancestors of icefish,” he concluded. Since then, these kinds of “antifreeze compounds have been discovered in different fish, insects, plants, and fungi living in both the northern and southern polar regions.”

But the poles don’t only provide clues to life on Earth. Since the first meteorite was discovered in Antarctica in 1912, more than 50,000 others have been recovered from the Antarctic, providing a glimpse into the history of the universe: “These small meteorites hold the material that swirled around the sun prior to the formation of the planets and asteroids. The components of the meteorites reflect the brick and mortar of our part of the solar system, the basic ingredients that went into the making of our planet and others.”

Glacial ice can be more than one thing at a time in various places: part liquid, part solid; it can melt, bend, refreeze, and even act like a gel. It defies simple explanations.

It’s only toward the end that Shubin directly addresses the impact of global warming on polar regions. Permafrost, which is ground that is frozen or below freezing for at least two years, makes up approximately 15 percent of the Northern Hemisphere. When it melts, he notes, the results can be devastating: “Melting permafrost changes the landscape because liquid water takes up less volume than ice. When ice thaws, the ground above buckles and a crater can appear at the surface.” One such crater in Batagay, in far eastern Russia, started to form in the 1970s and is now nearly a half mile long and expanding by as much as 20 feet each year, Shubin writes.

Meanwhile, Arctic communities are learning to adapt as best they can ⏤ a strategy that includes relocation. Encroaching water and land erosion has already forced some Alaskan villages to undergo the complicated process of moving an entire town, made more complex by the remote location. The community of Newtok successfully lobbied the Federal Emergency Management Agency to secure federal funds to help establish a new village, Shubin writes, but constructing housing remains a challenge. In December 2024, with nearly 20 families living in temporary tiny houses at the new townsite, critical infrastructure in Newtok was turned off as the last of nearly 400 residents finished packing their belongings.

As Shubin demonstrates in “Ends of the Earth,” the stark polar regions present extreme challenges not only to humans, but to all living things. Yet, through adaptation, life finds a way. “Success and longevity in the polar world is something different altogether from life elsewhere,” Shubin reflects in the book’s last chapter. “It is a story of Survival of the Resilient.”
