                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Egyptologist believes he has identified evidence that a rite known as the "Awakening of Osiris" was performed in Tutankhamun's burial chamber.

The whole burial chamber seems to be set up to recreate a funerary rite known from later times called 'the Awakening of Osiris.'

Osiris was an ancient Egyptian god of the underworld, who, according to mythology, was brought back to life after he was murdered by his brother Seth. At one point in the story, his son Horus waves a staff at Osiris and commands him to awaken.

The rite recreates this story in some ways. While reexamining excavation records of Tutankhamun's tomb, Brown noticed that four clay troughs and four staffs were found in Tutankhamun's burial chamber.

These four troughs would have held libations, likely of water, that could have been poured on or near Tutankhamun's mummy, while the four staffs would have represented the staff used by Horus.

The water libations hold great symbolic value. In the Pyramid Texts, a series of funerary texts written onto the walls of some Egyptian pyramids, "liquid libations are said to be fluid derived from the corpse of the deceased, or from the corpse of Osiris,"

He also noted that water used for libations, retrieved from the Nile River, was known as the "Eye of Horus" and was "a powerful symbol of regeneration and overcoming evil, including death."

The four troughs and four staffs would have represented the cardinal directions and would "symbolically surround the deceased for protection," Brown said.

Tutankhamun's father, the pharaoh Akhenaten, brought about a revolution that tried to focus Egyptian religion around the worship of the Aten, the sun disk. 

He even ordered an iconoclasm that saw the destruction of the names and images of other deities.

When Tutankhamun came to power, he undid this revolution, thus returning Egypt to its polytheistic religion. "Tutankhamun and the officials acting on his behalf had the opportunity to adapt, alter, and change royal funerary practice and bring back Osiris into the picture," Brown said.

The Awakening of Osiris ritual was one way to show that Osiris was back.

Paula Veiga, a doctoral student and researcher at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich who wasn't involved with Brown's paper but has studied and written extensively about Osiris, generally supported the findings.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JWST spotted ultraviolet light escaping from the ancient galaxy JADES-GS-z13-1 in the earliest evidence yet for the "Era of Reionization."

An ancient galactic lighthouse is shining through the fog of the early universe, new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations reveal.

The universe was a soup of protons, neutrons and electrons shortly after the Big Bang. As the universe cooled, the protons and neutrons combined to form positively charged hydrogen ions, which then attracted negatively charged electrons to create a fog of neutral hydrogen atoms. This fog absorbed light with short wavelengths, such as UV light.

But as the first stars and galaxies formed, they emitted enough UV light to knock the electrons back off the hydrogen atoms, allowing UV light out once again. The "Era of Reionization" is thought to have ended about a billion years after the Big Bang.

The new findings could help narrow down that starting point. Using JWST, researchers observed an ancient galaxy known as JADES-GS-z13-1.

In the JWST data, the scientists spotted bright light at a specific wavelength known as the Lyman-alpha emission. The light started out as ultraviolet but has been stretched into the infrared region over more than 13 billion years.

JADES-GS-z13-1 must have ionized enough of the hydrogen gas around it to allow the UV light to escape, something scientists hadn't expected so early in the universe's development.

The Lyman-alpha emission is seen when the universe was only 330 million years old. "GS-z13-1 is seen when the universe was only 330 million years old, yet it shows a surprisingly clear, telltale signature of Lyman-alpha emission," study co-author Roberto Maiolino said.

Researchers still don't know what produced the Lyman-alpha radiation in JADES-GS-z13-1. The light might come from extremely hot and massive early stars, or it might be produced by an early supermassive black hole.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake hit central Myanmar (formerly Burma) on Friday, shaking Mandalay, the country's second-largest city, as well as nearby countries.

The shallow earthquake struck at 12:50 p.m. local time (2:20 a.m. EDT) at a depth of about 6.2 miles (10 kilometers), according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

Just 12 minutes later, a magnitude 6.7 earthquake at the same depth shook south of the first one, and later that day, nine smaller earthquakes, ranging from magnitude 4.4 to 4.9, also hit the region.

At least 144 people were killed in the earthquakes, and 732 were injured, Myanmar's military junta said.

A monastery and multiple buildings collapsed in Myanmar.

In Bangkok, at least 10 people died when a 33-story high-rise under construction fell down; Thai authorities also said 16 people were injured and 101 were missing.

The earthquakes struck at the Sagaing Fault, which runs north-south and spans nearly 1,000 miles (1,600 km) through Myanmar toward the Andaman Sea.

Earthquakes that occur on this fault are known strike-slip quakes, in which one block of land moves horizontally past a block of land on the other side of the fault.

The Indian Plate has been moving northward for around 100 million years, and its collision with the Eurasian Plate helped create the Himalayas.

Even today, the Indian Plate is still moving northward into the Eurasian plate, accumulating energy that gets released in earthquakes like those in Southeastern Asia.

Today's magnitude 7.7 earthquake was so big that it wouldn't be surprising if the ground were displaced several meters horizontally.

This is a very big earthquake; we don't have many of these, according to van der Pluijm.

Since 1900, the region has had six other magnitude 7 or greater big strike-slip earthquakes within about 155 miles (250 km) of today's earthquake.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Turkey is strategically important as it is at the crossroads between Asia and Europe, making it a key power broker in deals with Europe, the US, and Russia.

Since the early 2000s, Turkey has relied on a foreign policy approach that emphasized cooperation instead of competition, which helped improve its relationships with Russia, Iran, and Syria.

Turkey views its ties with Russia, Ukraine, China, and countries in the Middle East as equally important, and it will work with whatever government benefits its interests.

Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has no qualms about confronting both friends and rivals equally, giving Turkey strategic flexibility.

Turkey is Russia's second-biggest trading partner, with over US$60 billion (£46.3 billion) in trade annually with Moscow.

The Turkish relationship with Russia improved dramatically in 1995 when Russia stopped supporting the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), and Turkey stopped supporting Chechen rebels.

Turkey maintains a functional relationship with Russia but has never been pliant to Moscow, criticizing Russia's military bases in Syria and restricting Russian access through its control of airspace in northern Syria.

The Black Sea is another area of competition where Turkey has emerged with the upper hand during the war in Ukraine.

Russia aimed to exercise control over the Black Sea by seizing Ukrainian ports, affecting global grain supply in 2022, but Turkey negotiated the release of millions of tonnes of grain and ensured shipping route safety.

Turkey enforced the Montreux Convention, a 1936 agreement that granted Turkish control over shipping routes through the Bosporus Strait, Sea of Marmara, and Dardanelles.

The Black Sea has strategic importance to Turkey due to its historical significance and the presence of more than 5 million Turks with Crimean Tatar roots.

Turkey maintains communication with Moscow but does not accept Russia's annexation of Crimea.

Turkey also supports Ukraine, supplying it with Bayraktar TB2 drones, heavy machine guns, and other equipment to help keep Russian naval power in check.

Turkey wants Ukraine to remain independent to balance Russian influence in the Black Sea region.

Turkey is willing to contribute peacekeepers to a post-ceasefire settlement under the right conditions.

The conflict in Ukraine has allowed Turkey to diversify its supply routes for energy, reducing its dependence on Russia and relying more on suppliers from the Caucasus region and central Asia.

Turkey aims to become an energy hub by facilitating gas transit from the Caucasus, central Asia, and Russia to Europe through the Trans-Anatolian natural gas pipeline.

The discovery of gas reserves in the Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean has strengthened Turkey's position as a key player in energy supply routes.

Turkey pursued rapprochement with Syria in 2005 when Bashar al-Assad became president, but later abandoned this relationship when it no longer suited Turkish interests.

Turkey created a safe zone on its border with Syria, which housed displaced Syrians and armed fighters, giving rebels the go-ahead to oust Assad in 2024.

The conflict in Ukraine has strengthened Turkey's bargaining position, allowing it to push for closer cooperation with Europe.

Turkey is taking advantage of Donald Trump's more lenient policies towards Russia to improve its relationship with the US.

Turkey wants to purchase F-35 supersonic fighter jets from the US and hopes that sanctions will be lifted on third countries that have engaged with Russia.

The US sees Turkey as a key ally despite some different strategic goals, hosting Turkish bases for US and Nato forces, and storing US nuclear weapons at Incirlik Air Force Base.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States is one of the top three most visited countries in the world.

The big draw cards – cities such as San Francisco, New York and Chicago and national parks such as Yosemite – have attracted international tourists for decades.

This combined with its role as a global business powerhouse meant it had 66.5 million visitors in 2023 – and the 2024 figure is expected to be higher still.


But a lot has changed in recent months, and 2025's figures may not be as strong.

The 2024 reelection of Donald Trump as the president of the United States and the consequential changes in foreign diplomacy and relations, alongside internal cultural shifts, are starting to change global attitudes towards the US – attitudes that appear to be affecting tourists' desire to visit the US.


In a recent report by research firm Tourism Economics, inbound travel to the US is now projected to decline by 5.5% this year, instead of growing by nearly 9% as had previously been forecast.

A further escalation in tariff and trade wars could result in further reductions in international tourism, which could amount to a $18 billion annual reduction in tourist spending in 2025.


There is already some evidence of travel cancellations.

Since Trump announced 25% tariffs on many Canadian goods, the number of Canadians driving across the border at some crossings has fallen by up to 45%, on some days, when compared to last year.


Canada is the biggest source of international tourists to the US.

Air Canada has announced it is reducing flights to some US holiday destinations, including Las Vegas, from March, as demand reduces.


According to a March poll by Canadian market researcher Leger, 36% of Canadians who had planned trips to the United States had already cancelled them.

According to data from the aviation analytics company OAG, passenger bookings on Canada to US routes are down by over 70% compared to the same period last year.


The U.S. Travel Association warned that even a 10% reduction in Canadian inbound travel could result in a $2.1 billion loss in spending, putting 140,000 hospitality jobs at risk.


Some would-be visitors have cited an unwelcoming political climate as part of a concern about visiting the US – including angry rhetoric about foreigners, migrants and the LGBTQ+ community.

The Tourism Economics report also cited "polarizing Trump Administration policies and rhetoric" as a factor in travel cancellations.


There are other factors that may influence travellers from, for instance, western Europe, which represented 37% of overseas travel to the US last year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have found two specimens of a 444 million-year-old "inside-out" fossil with well-preserved soft tissue.

Unlike most fossils, the creature's muscles and guts — but not its more durable shell — are preserved in ancient sediment that turned to stone.

The fossil, found 250 miles (402 kilometers) north of Cape Town in South Africa, is a new species of multisegmented arthropod that may have lived in oxygen-poor waters.


 Researchers named the new species Keurbos susanae and nicknamed the fossil "Sue" after its discoverer's mom.

"Sue is an inside-out, legless, headless wonder," lead author Sarah Gabbott , a paleontologist at the University of Leicester in the U.K., said in a statement . 

The researchers found the fossils in the Soom Shale, a site known for producing fossils with well-preserved soft tissues, more than 20 years ago.

They had hoped to find additional specimens, but fossils of the species turned out to be quite rare.

Sue dates back to the Late Ordovician mass extinction (443 million years ago), when cold temperatures and glacier advancement eliminated nearly 85% of marine species.

The shells and exoskeletons of species preserved in Soom Shale likely dissolved in the acidic ocean.

Because the K. susanae specimen was fossilized inside out, scientists still aren't sure of the species' evolutionary history or how it compares to other fossils from the same time period.

"We are now sure she was a primitive marine arthropod, but her precise evolutionary relationships remain frustratingly elusive," Gabbott said in the statement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A massive plume of steam has been released from Alaska's Mount Spurr volcano, images show.

In an update on March 28 , the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) shared an image of the restless volcano taken on March 26, revealing steam and gas pouring from both the summit and a vent on the northern flank.

The increase in gas emissions confirms that new magma has intruded into the Earth’s crust beneath the volcano and indicates that an eruption is likely, but not certain, to occur within the next few weeks or months.

Mount Spurr, located around 80 miles (128 kilometers) west of Anchorage, is the highest volcano in the Aleutian Range, standing at 11,070 feet (3,374 meters) tall. The volcano consists of a central summit and a prominent side vent known as Crater Peak, located 2 miles (3.5 km) south of the summit.

Images of Mount Spurr on March 26, 2025, from the Glen Alps Overlook in Anchorage, Alaska. Steam and gas emissions can be seen as a plume above the summit crater, and steaming from a small fumarole on the north flank is also visible.

AVO representatives said that the alert level for the volcano may be raised to an orange/watch or even a red/warning in the coming weeks if further signs of an eruption appear.

In the event of an eruption, the biggest hazards would be ash clouds that may affect aviation, ashfall, pyroclastic flows, and lahars, which are fast-moving, destructive mudflows that occur on the slopes of volcanoes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) is a research university and constituent college of the University of London, dating back to the foundation of London Hospital Medical College in 1785. Based in Mile End in the East End of London, Queen Mary is organised into three faculties – the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, the Faculty of Science and Engineering, and Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry.

A member of the Russell Group of leading British research universities, Queen Mary is a major centre for medical teaching and research and is part of UCL Partners, the world’s largest academic health science centre. Times Higher Education ranks Queen Mary 48th in its 2018 ranking of European universities, and it was ranked 15th in the Times Higher Education Best Universities in the UK 2017. There are eight Nobel Laureates amongst Queen Mary’s alumni and current and former staff.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Twice a year, around a quarter of the world’s population dutifully reset their clocks.

Circadian rhythms govern many physiological processes in plants, animals and even bacteria, highlighting life’s remarkable sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions.

Your biological internal clock is controlled in a small region of the brain called the hypothalamus. It regulates hormone release, body temperature and metabolism. 

Most people take three to seven days to adjust to daylight saving time (DST). However, night owls can take two to three weeks to realign their sleep-wake cycles.

Research suggests diet also plays a role. People who eat high-fat diets seem to experience prolonged circadian misalignment after the spring clock change.

A 2008 study on rodents found that those on high-fat diets adapted 20% more slowly to a six-hour light shift compared to those on low-fat diets.

We do know light exposure is also important for adapting to time change. One hypothesis suggests that a high-fat diet reduces circadian sensitivity to light.

Researchers have wondered whether the connection between high-fat diet and circadian sensitivity may be since late evening eating is associated with weight gain.

A 2024 study found no significant differences in meal timing between diet groups, suggesting that it’s the food itself, rather than the time it is eaten, that’s the key factor.

Exposure to natural light is one of the most important factors in helping the body adjust to a new time. The more morning sunlight a person gets, the faster their circadian rhythm realigns.

Research suggests that adaptation is harder in spring than in autumn, with increased wakefulness during sleep (10–30 minutes more), greater sleep fragmentation (between 5–20%), and poorer sleep quality after the spring transition.

The link between natural light and cognitive function was highlighted by a 2020 study which demonstrated the benefits of increased daylight exposure. Thirty participants spent one week working in each of two office environments with identical layouts, furnishings and orientations.

Participants in the optimised daylight condition slept 37 minutes longer and scored 42% higher on decision-making tasks.

The human circadian rhythm runs slightly longer than 24 hours (typically 24.2–24.5 hours).

This makes clock delays (autumn transition) easier to adjust to than clock advances (spring transition) because our body naturally drifts forward each day.

Delaying sleep aligns with this tendency, whereas advancing sleep disrupts melatonin release, which regulates your energy levels and the natural urge to go to bed.

In 2007, German researchers monitored 50 healthy adults for four weeks before and after each transition and found that spring adaptation took five to seven days longer than fall adaptation.

A 2008 Finnish study studied nine adults before and after both transitions and found that during the spring transition, people’s gradual increase in body temperature was delayed by 30–60 minutes.

The study also found sleep quality dropped by 5–15%, and nighttime movement increased by 10–25% — all indicators of circadian misalignment.

Total time in bed increased after the spring transition but participants’ sleep was fragmented and of lower quality.

Research has linked daylight saving time (DST) transitions to changes in mortality rates, during the first eight weeks after the transition, particularly in relation to cardiovascular complications.

A 2024 study analysing 14 million deaths in the US from 2015 to 2019 found a slight increase in all deaths after the spring transition but a decrease in mortality after the autumn transition.

The study also found a rising trend in dementia-related mortality, with a 5% increase in deaths peaking in the fifth week after the spring transition.

Additionally, a slight increase in cancer-related mortality was noted in the first week after DST begins.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A habit that is worrying health authorities in Sweden where increasing numbers of teenagers are taking what’s known as “snus” is also concerning football authorities in England.

White snus consists of small, tobacco-free pouches containing nicotine, plant-based fibres and flavourings.

Traditional snus, a moist brown tobacco product, is almost exclusive to Sweden.

The introduction of white snus – also known as nicotine pouches – has led to rapid global expansion.

The rise in popularity of white snus around the world can be attributed to aggressive social media marketing campaigns where “Zynfluencers” are sponsored to promote white snus in their lifestyle content.

While marketing for cigarettes and vapes is strictly regulated in the EU, the rules for white snus are up to the individual countries to decide.

Many countries don’t regulate white snus so consumers – even very young ones – can order the nicotine pouches easily.

In Sweden, 15% of young women aged 16-29 use white snus daily, while only 2.5 % smoke cigarettes daily in the same age group.

Some commercials target women by suggesting that white snus offers a discreet “clean” way to feel the benefits of a nicotine hit.

The marketing of white snus often stresses that they are “tobacco-free” because the pouches do not contain tobacco leaf.

But that label can be misleading – the nicotine in these products is usually derived from tobacco leaves.

Some also confuse tobacco-free with nicotine-free.

Advertisements often emphasise how white snus can be used anywhere and enhance social situations, while offering a variety of flavours from coffee to spearmint and black cherry.

The nicotine pouch was originally developed by a nicotine replacement therapy company in the early 2000s – but they didn’t gain traction until 2016 when the tobacco snus company Swedish Match introduced their product Zyn.

Zyn is now owned by Philip Morris International, one of the world’s largest tobacco companies White snus is not an approved nicotine replacement therapy, which means that it is not recommended as an aid to quit smoking.

While nicotine-free white snus exists, most products on the market contain nicotine.

Nicotine is highly addictive, so many of those who try a nicotine product – no matter which one – will find it hard to stop using it.

Young people are especially sensitive to the addictive properties of nicotine.

The wide range of white snus flavours available, often fruit, menthol or candy, may further lower the threshold for use.

Research suggests that nicotine may also have a negative impact on brain development.

Other potential risks include a negative effects on cardiovascular and oral health.

But long-term effects specific to white snus remain unclear.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Royal Holloway is one of the UK’s leading research-intensive universities, which is ranked in the top 20 universities in the UK and the top 300 universities in the world by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings for 2020.

The most recent Research Excellence Framework (REF) confirmed that Royal Holloway sits within the top 25 per cent of universities in the UK for research which is rated ‘world-leading’ or ‘internationally excellent’.

In the independent National Student Survey, we achieved an overall satisfaction rating of 88%, making us four percentage points above the sector average and higher than 21 of the 22 Russell Group universities.

Royal Holloway offers a genuine community experience, one that inspires individuals to succeed. Its 135 acre campus is located in Egham, 40 minutes by train from central London. The Egham campus was established by Thomas Holloway, a Victorian entrepreneur, philanthropist and social reformer. He was also responsible for building the College’s Grade 1 listed Founder’s Building.

Royal Holloway College was officially opened in 1886 by Queen Victoria, and became a member the University of London in 1900. It merged with Bedford College in 1985 to become Royal Holloway, University of London.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>France has handed over control of two military bases in Dakar, Senegal to the Senegalese government.

The move follows an announcement by President Bassirou Diomaye Faye that all foreign troops would be required to leave the country.

Faye stated that "Senegal is an independent country, a sovereign nation, and sovereignty does not allow for the presence of foreign military bases."

Unlike in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, where military juntas have expelled French and American troops in recent years, this move comes from a democratically elected leader.

Faye secured a decisive victory in Senegal's 2024 presidential election despite efforts by the former president to extend his rule beyond constitutional limits.


The Ivory Coast has called for the end of its colonial-era military pact with France.

There are indications that US forces may soon be asked to leave Ghana.

Younger generations of African leaders, shaped by decades of witnessing foreign-backed governments fail to boost development and security, are increasingly focused on decolonising their countries.

This shift has also been driven by growing public awareness of the exploitation of Africa's natural resources by some former colonial powers.


Senegal plans to replace the CFA franc with a national currency to further distance itself from France.

The CFA franc gives French companies easier access to natural resources in African countries where it is used.

President Emmanuel Macron dismissed concerns about the impact of the CFA franc on Africa's development in 2019.


Senegal is reshaping its public spaces by renaming streets and landmarks associated with colonial figures.

Efforts are also underway in central Africa to replace colonial-era street names.

In Niger's capital, Niamey, Avenue de Gaulle has been renamed Avenue Djibo Bakary.


A court ruling in Uganda mandated the removal of British colonial monuments and renaming streets that honour "crooks and historical figureheads".

Figures affected include Maj. Gen. Henry Edward Colville and Frederick Lugard, a key colonial administrator in Africa.


A political shift seems to be taking place in Africa, particularly in the Sahel.

In the 1960s, leaders from the continent took up arms against the colonial establishment.

Amílcar Cabral and Nelson Mandela were among those who fought for independence.


The rhetoric and actions of many military-led governments in the Sahel echo those of Africa's early independence movements.


Public rallies held by Captain Ibrahim Traoré in Burkina Faso regularly draw large crowds.

Traoré was welcomed by cheering crowds during recent inaugurations of democratically elected presidents in Senegal and Ghana.


Some analysts have warned of instability following the expulsion of foreign troops from the Sahel.

However, decades of foreign military interventions have done little to improve security in the region.


The influence of insurgent groups has grown despite counterinsurgency operations.

A report by the Africa Center for Strategic Studies found that the Sahel has been the epicentre of violence in Africa for four consecutive years.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We are riddled with microplastics. It is in our bloodstream, in our lungs, in our liver – pretty much anywhere you look in the human body, you will find minuscule bits of plastic.

And there are many ways for us to ingest, inhale or otherwise absorb these tiny fragments. For example, a single plastic teabag sheds over 10 billion microplastic particles into a cup of tea.

Chewing gum contains long molecules called polymers. Some brands of gum contain natural polymers from tree sap. Others contain synthetic polymers derived from the petroleum industry.

These various polymers are similar to plastics – and some actually are plastics. Chewing gum polymers, both natural and synthetic, can release microparticles when they are worn down by chewing.

In a study presented at the American Chemical Society meeting 25 March, a single volunteer chewed ten brands of chewing gum – five natural and five synthetic. Saliva samples were taken from the volunteer’s mouth and put under the microscope.

Surprisingly, microplastics were found in both the natural and synthetic chewing gums. The researchers calculated that one piece of gum could shed hundreds or a few thousand microplastic particles into the mouth, where they probably ended up being swallowed.

The types of plastics found in the gums were polystyrenes (used for things like takeaway food containers), polyethylenes (such as those used to make plastic grocery bags) and polypropylenes (which are used to make, among other things, car bumpers and medicine bottles).

But, before we start worrying about the microplastics liberated by chewing gum, we need to know how large they were. The microplastics found in the saliva of the gum-chewing volunteer were 20 micrometres or more in size.

That is about the diameter of the thinnest human hair. But from the perspective of a cell in the human body, 20 microns is huge (a red blood cell, for instance, is about seven microns in diameter).

This is important because the microplastics that are known to be capable of harming cells and embryos are 500 to 1,000 times smaller than that (20 to 500 nanometers). These super-small microplastics are called nanoplastics.

Nanoplastics are bad news because they are small enough to be engulfed by living cells via a process called endocytosis. When nanoplastics are absorbed into cells, they can cause all sorts of trouble, such as triggering the cell to produce toxic molecules called reactive oxygen species.

These toxins may not kill the cell outright, but they can weaken it. Likewise, the plastic particles that have been shown to cause birth defects in animal embryos are also the very small ones (the nanoplastics), not the much larger microplastics.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, appeared before the Senate intelligence committee to discuss the US intelligence services' annual threat assessment (ATA).

Most of the committee's time was focused on a revelation about top security officials discussing plans for an attack on Yemen in an insecure chat group.

Gabbard and her colleagues refused to admit that this had been a security breach.

The ATA is a combined assessment by 18 US intelligence agencies, headed up by the Office for National Intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency.

The 2025 version of the report reflects Trump's shift in security priorities in three ways: prioritizing domestic threats over foreign adversaries, ignoring climate change as a critical threat, and softening language on Russia.

In her opening statement, Gabbard identified "cartels, gangs, and other transnational criminal organisations" as the top threats to US national security.

An American increasingly focused on its president's preferences is indicated by this shift in priorities.

Climate change was absent from the report, despite being a critical threat and force multiplier for other threats such as migration and famine.

A testy exchange between Gabbard and Senator Angus King occurred when King asked about climate change being omitted from the report.

Gabbard replied that the report focused on direct threats to national security, but noted the security impact of melting sea ice in the Arctic.

The 2025 ATA notes increasing cooperation between Russia and China in the Arctic and a growing Chinese footprint in the region.

Russian threat was downplayed in the report, with language changed from "seeks to project and defend its interests globally" to "restore Russian strength and security".

The report also assesses that Russia has seized the upper hand in Ukraine and is on a path to accrue greater leverage.

It presents Russia's malign influence activities as aimed at countering threats, affording them legitimacy.

This change of policy doubles down on the idea that the US should accommodate the Kremlin's conditions for a ceasefire.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The climate activist group Just Stop Oil (JSO) has announced the end of its campaign of direct action.

Many will read the group's legacy through the lens of public hostility: the frustration caused, the angry headlines, the outrage at its tactics.

Not only have JSO activists been spat at, physically assaulted and run over by angry car drivers, but 15 members are also currently serving jail sentences following arrests and charges.

But the intense backlash directed at JSO is not evidence that its campaign faltered. It is a sign that these activists succeeded in emotionally charging the public debate about climate change.

They gave the public something to argue about, react to, even mock — and in doing so, made the climate crisis impossible to ignore.

The alternative, an apathetic consensus, would entail passively accepting the dominant approach to address the climate crisis. That means market-based solutions, a faith in technological innovation, and incremental policy reforms within existing political and economic systems.

These have arguably to date failed, as global temperatures continue to skyrocket.

Through my own research on climate activism, I have studied how environmental protest influences policy, corporate behaviour and financial markets.

Activists can stimulate change, but not through rational arguments alone.

Change happens by making an emotional splash. It creates antagonism, dissent and tension, which are all needed to enliven public debate.

Emotions including anger, fear and guilt play a key role in the ability of activists to create moral urgency and force issues into the spotlight.

JSO harnessed this emotional logic not only from supporters, but from critics. Those who dragged protesters off roads, raged in comment sections and professed their hate towards the group were reacting because the group had emotionally triggered them.

Like a person who gets under your skin, JSO became very hard to ignore.

As business scholars Thomas Davenport and John Beck argue in their book The Attention Economy, in a saturated information landscape, being memorable — even disruptively — is a strategic advantage.

In this sense, JSO "hacked" this logic by demanding emotional and cognitive attention, whether through support or outrage.

Disruptive protests may be unpopular, but they are effective at attracting media attention and public awareness.

As many studies suggest, the more illogical or disruptive a protest, the more media coverage it receives — despite coverage not necessarily translating into more donations and support.

Of course, disruption risks alienating some people — but that can actually strengthen a movement's overall influence.

The "radical flank effect" shows that when radical activists push boundaries, they often make moderate voices in the same movement appear more reasonable.

Recent research on JSO found that even when the group provoked public anger, support for moderate organisations such as Friends of the Earth increased.

This dynamic reflects what sociologist Thomas Roulet calls The Power of Being Divisive. Being controversial can actually benefit a cause by amplifying its message and deepening support from those already aligned.

Polarisation, in this view, is not always harmful — it can be strategically useful. In the case of JSO activists, controversy did not dilute their message. Rather, it intensified its resonance with those already primed to act.

JSO has also uniquely been able to provide direction for many struggling to navigate climate change's volatile emotional context.

As philosopher Glenn A. Albrecht describes in his book Earth Emotions, events such as climate change, mass species extinction and environmental degradation are creating a global emotional crisis, marked by a mix of grief, anxiety and powerlessness.

JSO has effectively tapped into this emotional turbulence, turning despair into urgency and action.

Its actions can be seen as emotional interventions for a society struggling to process ecological loss.

Left undirected, emotions related to conditions such as climate change-related "eco-anxiety" can lead to paralysis – a state of emotional overwhelm that prevents people from taking meaningful action or engaging with the climate problem.

But research shows that when movements channel emotions — especially by transforming fear into shared action — they build momentum.

One study of climate organisers found that protest participation gave people a way to manage despair by reclaiming a sense of purpose and solidarity.

A frequent refrain is that the objectives are valid, but the strategies are too extreme. But history shows that disruptive tactics have long played a role in forcing attention to urgent issues.

From the suffragettes chaining themselves to railings, to civil rights sit-ins, to ACT UP's dramatic interventions during the Aids crisis — disruption has often preceded progress.

Movements that are easy to ignore tend to be forgotten. JSO made itself, and its cause, very hard to ignore.

The group's legacy will likely continue to spark debate about the effectiveness of direct action as a means to bring attention to climate change issues.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disney's streaming hit Paradise is a political thriller that sees the murder of a former president in a peaceful community, leaning into dystopian themes around apocalypse survival.

In Apple TV's drama Silo, civilisation has resorted to living and working deep in an underground storage facility as a means to protect humanity from the wasteland above.

Michelle and Barack Obama's Netflix thriller Leave The World Behind depicts the US facing chaos and unrest as a cybersecurity attack takes down the country's entire technological infrastructure.

Similar tropes appear in Zero Day, starring Rober De Niro as a former president tasked with finding out who is behind a cyber attack that has resulted in the deaths of thousands of people.

And then there is The End, a climate-crisis musical starring Tilda Swinton that dips into the strange world of a wealthy family living deep underground in a luxurious bunker.

Dystopian dramas are clearly in vogue right now, but films and TV dramas have often reflected the fears and anxieties of their times. 

A Clockwork Orange (1971) portrayed the class conflict and wanton violence of the 1970s. TV series Threads (1984) tapped into fears of a nuclear attack.

Ghost in the Shell (1995) focused on identity in an increasingly technology-obsessed world. And Children of Men (2006) centred on the bleak terror of a world without children.

More recently, The Walking Dead (2010 onwards) focused on what it means to cling onto humanity in an unrelenting world, while Squid Game (2021-) is a dystopian reflection of capitalism exploring the circumstances that drive desperate people to participate in a deadly competition for money.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The recent announcement that young people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will have the opportunity to take a new GCSE in natural history from September 2025 is welcome news.

The new qualification will include practical skills such as observation, monitoring, recording and analysis, and immersion in outdoor activities.

It has support from the Natural History Museum, the Field Studies Council and the Wildlife Trusts.

However, while this will go some way to further bring sustainability and climate concerns into schools, the qualification is optional.


The whole national curriculum in England is under review. This provides a crucial opportunity to embed climate change and sustainability education throughout the curriculum.

The independent review’s recent interim report identifies a need for a “greater focus on sustainability and climate science”.


We explored young people’s views of climate change education in secondary schools, carrying out a national survey of 1,000 14- to 18-year-olds and two follow-up in-depth workshops.

We found that young people consistently identified climate change as the top concern for their future lives, putting it above the cost of living crisis and young people’s mental health and wellbeing.

Seven in ten teenagers told us they would welcome the opportunity to learn more about climate change in school.


Our research shows there needs to be a step change in how the education system prepares young people for a rapidly changing world.

Engaging them meaningfully with the issues and practical solutions may motivate them to consider a green career.

In maths, for example, mathematical concepts could be introduced through calculating the effect of introducing solar panels on the school roof.


Our report also found that current teaching on climate tends to focus narrowly on impacts and rarely on solutions. This may contribute to many young people’s sense of climate change anxiety, leaving them feeling demotivated and disenfranchised.


Scotland's learning for sustainability vision takes a cross-curricular, solutions-focused approach.

Young people are often involved in creatively solving problems or finding solutions to questions that are meaningful to them.


There is much mis- and disinformation on climate circulating online. With the rise of artificial intelligence, the distinction between fact and fiction is becoming increasingly difficult to discern.


Overhauling and refreshing England’s current curriculum and assessment system will not be easy.

Even if climate change is increasingly included, this still may take place too slowly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fish that survive in extreme deep-sea environments have developed the same genetic mutation despite evolving separately and at different times, researchers say.

The scientists also found industrial chemicals in fish and in the ground in the Mariana Trench , meaning human-made pollutants can reach some of the deepest environments on Earth.

Deep-sea fish have developed unique adaptations to survive extreme pressure, low temperatures and almost complete darkness. These species adapt to extreme conditions through unique skeletal structures, altered circadian rhythms and either vision that's extremely fine-tuned for low light, or are reliant on non-visual senses.

In a new study, published March 6 in the journal Cell , researchers analyzed the DNA of 11 fishes, including snailfish, cusk-eels and lizardfish that live in the hadal zone — the region about 19,700 feet (6,000 meters) deep and below — to better understand how they evolved under such extreme conditions.

The researchers used crewed submarines and remotely operated vehicles to collect samples from about 3,900 to 25,300 feet (1,200 to 7,700 m) below the water's surface, in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific and other trenches in the Indian Ocean.

Tracing the evolution of deep-sea fishes, the researchers' analysis revealed that the eight lineages of fish species studied entered the deep-sea environment at different times: The earliest likely entered the deep sea in the early Cretaceous period (about 145 million years ago), while others reached it during the Paleogene (66 million to 23 million years ago), and some species as recently as the Neogene period (23 million to 2.6 million years ago).

Despite different timelines for making the deep sea their home, all the fishes studied living below 9,800 feet (3,000 m) showed the same type of mutation in the Rtf1 gene, which controls how DNA is coded and expressed.

This means all these fishes developed the same mutation separately, as a result of the same deep-sea environment, rather than as the result of a shared evolutionary ancestor — showing just how strongly deep-sea conditions shape these species' biology.

"This study shows that deep-sea fishes, despite originating from very different branches of the fish tree of life, have evolved similar genetic adaptations to survive the harsh environment of the deep ocean — cold, dark, and high-pressure," 

The expeditions also revealed human-made pollutants in the Mariana Trench and Philippine Trench.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tomorrow, viewers in parts of the Northern Hemisphere, including 13 states in the northeastern U.S., will get to witness a partial solar eclipse.

This phenomenon occurs when the moon passes between the sun and Earth and partially blocks the sun, making it look like a bite has been taken out of our nearest star.


But staring directly at the sun without certified eclipse glasses can lead to an eye condition known as solar retinopathy, which can cause permanent vision loss.


Solar retinopathy occurs when intense light causes damage to the light-sensitive tissue in the retina.

The retina detects light and converts it into signals that the brain translates into the images that you see.

Despite its name, solar retinopathy can be caused by any intense light source, including the sun, a laser pointer or the bright light from a welding torch.

Solar retinopathy can occur within seconds of exposure to intense light in one, or more often, both eyes.


Anyone who stares at the sun, even on a regular day, can get solar retinopathy, Dr. Julie Rosenthal said.

However, the eclipse is a time that those of us who don't weld or use lasers can easily get exposed to this kind of damage, she said.


People may be particularly vulnerable to solar retinopathy during a partial eclipse because the dark conditions caused by the sun being partly covered prevent the protective reflexes in the eye from properly kicking in.


When it's light outside, people tend to squint their eyes while their pupils constrict to protect the retina.

However, when it's dark, the pupils dilate, allowing more light to enter the eye and potentially damage the retina.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A powerful magnitude 7.7 earthquake rocked central Myanmar on March 28 at about 12:50 p.m. local time, leaving at least 144 people confirmed dead so far and triggering widespread damage across both Myanmar and Thailand.

 
Buildings collapsed, roads broke and at least one dam and a bridge crumbled. A magnitude 6.4 aftershock followed just 10 minutes later.


With both countries declared disaster areas, international aid workers are scrambling to prepare supplies and assess the death toll and damages. Marie Manrique, Myanmar program coordinator for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told reporters March 28 that the organization is particularly concerned about damages to public infrastructure, including large-scale dams.

The earthquake had a trifecta of dangers: It was powerful; shallow, with the epicenter at just 10 kilometers depth; and in a heavily populated region with vulnerable buildings and other structures.


It was a strike-slip earthquake.

This earthquake was probably the result of sideways, or strike-slip, movement along the Sagaing Fault, a large fault that runs north to south through central Myanmar, according to the U.S. Geological Survey’s Earthquake Hazards Program.


Strike-slip earthquakes occur when two blocks of tectonic crust are trying to slide sideways past each other; the blocks of crust may briefly lock due to the friction, then wrench free, releasing a burst of seismic energy through the ground.


The Sagaing Fault is part of a complex and hazardous plate boundary. The fault marks the collision between the India tectonic plate, which includes the Indian subcontinent and part of the Indian Ocean, and the Sunda Plate, a smaller bit of crust that includes parts of Southeast Asia, including the Malaysia Peninsula.


As the India Plate slides northward, it grinds sideways against the Sunda plate to the east, occasionally generating powerful quakes. The Sagaing Fault region itself is rife with seismic hazards, and many large strike-slip quakes have occurred in the area over the last century, including a magnitude 7.0 in 1990 and a magnitude 7.9 in 1912, according to the USGS.


From 1930 to 1956, there were six quakes greater than magnitude 7 on the Sagaing Fault itself that killed hundreds. The India Plate’s northward drive has also put it on a collision course with the Eurasian Plate.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People who most frequently encounter everyday discrimination – those subtle snubs and slights of everyday life – are more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression.

Everyday discrimination refers to the routine ways people are treated unfairly because of characteristics such as skin color, perceived background or general appearance.

Generally, it means disrespectful treatment: waiting longer than others for help at a store, having your ideas dismissed without consideration at work, or hearing rude comments about your identity.

Although marginalized groups endure everyday discrimination most often, our study indicates that this is a widespread issue affecting people of all races and backgrounds.

I'm a professor who specializes in community health. My team and I analyzed data from the 2023 National Health Interview Survey, which included a weighted sample of nearly 30,000 U.S. adults, adjusted to accurately reflect more than 258 million people – approximately 75% of the country.

Along with reporting frequency of everyday discrimination, participants completed clinical screenings for depression and anxiety.

The results were striking: Nearly 56% of participants experienced at least occasional everyday discrimination, with 3.6% having “high levels,” meaning they faced discrimination most frequently – at least monthly and often weekly.

High levels were most prevalent among Black adults, at 8.6%. Multiracial respondents were next with 6.4%. Hispanics and white participants were at about 3%, Asians just over 2%.

Women and immigrants, people with disabilities and those who are overweight, obese or struggling with food insecurity also reported higher levels.

When compared with those reporting no discrimination, participants with high levels had five times the odds of screening positive for either depression or anxiety, and nearly nine times the odds of screening positive for both.

As discrimination increased, the increase in screening positive for depression, anxiety or both varied by race, with a more noticeable rise among groups that are often overlooked in these discussions – white, Asian and multiracial adults.

This doesn't mean discrimination is less harmful for Black, Hispanic/Latino or other racial and ethnic groups. One possible reason for our study's findings may be that groups that have long endured structural discrimination may have developed more ways over time to cope with it.

At some point, all of us experience unfair treatment due to our personal traits. But this type of discrimination isn’t just unpleasant. Our study shows it has real consequences for health.

Along with depression and anxiety, discrimination creates chronic stress, leading to increased risk for hypertension, heart disease, impaired brain functioning, accelerated aging and premature death.

For some, everyday discrimination may emerge at different times in life. This can happen to people as they get older or when they become ill.

But for others, it is a constant. This includes people living in marginalized communities, people of color, those socioeconomically disadvantaged or with disabilities, or those who identify as LGBTQ+.

Multiracial people are uniquely challenged because they navigate multiple racial identities. This often leads to feelings of isolation, which increases mental health risks.

White adults, though less frequently exposed to racial discrimination, still face mistreatment, particularly if they have lower incomes, limited education or working-class backgrounds.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While walking in Big Bend National Park in Texas' Chihuahuan Desert, a park volunteer came across a fuzzy flower that turned out to be a never-before-seen species.

The "woolly devil," as researchers have named it, is in the sunflower family and also represents a new genus. This is the first time in nearly 50 years that a new plant genus has been described in a U.S. national park, since the discovery of the July gold shrub (Dedeckera eurekensis) in Death Valley National Park in 1976.

The new discovery suggests that researchers are far from documenting all of the plant diversity of the Chihuahuan Desert, which covers parts of Mexico and the southwestern U.S. In March 2024, the park volunteer, Deb Manley, shared photos of the flowers — which measured 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 centimeters) across and were poking out from between desert rocks — to the citizen science platform iNaturalist.

An international community of botanists tried to identify the plant. Manley and a team of botanists and biologists studied the flower's characteristics and conducted genetic analyses, comparing its DNA with those of species from herbaria at Sul Ross State University in Texas and the California Academy of Sciences.

They confirmed the plant as both a new species and a new genus, and identified it as a member of the sunflower family. The researchers chose the scientific name Ovicula biradiata. In Latin "ovis" comes from "sheep" and honors the desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni), an iconic and threatened desert animal.

The plant has white and woolly leaves, with small, curved, red and white flowers that resemble horns. The flowers were found near a part of the park called Devil's Den, leading the team to name the species the "woolly devil."

The Chihuahuan Desert is North America's largest and most biologically diverse warm desert, and Big Bend National Park contains a huge amount of this biodiversity. Many species found in the park have limited distributions, found only within the park or just outside it.

So far, woolly devils are known to exist only in a small area of Big Bend National Park, and the researchers think that, based on its limited range, this plant might be particularly sensitive to changing weather patterns. This part of the Chihuahuan Desert has faced recent severe drought conditions, and the problem is expected to worsen due to climate change.

"That means woolly devils could qualify as vulnerable and face a high threat of extinction," said Isaac Lichter Marck, a botanist at the California Academy of Sciences. "As climate change pushes deserts to become hotter and drier, highly specialized plants like the wooly devil face extinction."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crime and policing bill has been introduced, making it a criminal offence to conceal your identity at a protest in specifically designated areas.

These powers are preemptive and vague – how is the “likelihood” of a protest or offences determined? What specific “offences” does the bill refer to? What safeguards exist?

Ultimately, the bill does not appear to place any real limits on the degree of discretion extended to the police.


The passage of this bill would have significant implications for the right to anonymity in public places. It is unparalleled among liberal democratic states, bringing UK practice into line with Russia, Hungary and China.

Under existing public order law, police already have the power to direct people to remove face coverings. The police justify these new powers on the basis that “individuals may follow the initial direction of the police officer to remove their face covering, but … move … and redeploy the face covering shortly afterwards.”

The bill continues the previous government’s attempts to erode the right to protest. It's clear that the motivation for these laws is not concern for public safety, but a desire to significantly extend surveillance powers.


Facial recognition

Why is a ban on face coverings being introduced now? No significant new challenges to the policing of protest have emerged in recent decades.

The difference now, however, is that facial recognition has recently become a viable policing technology.

As our forthcoming book details, facial recognition technology has rapidly transformed police surveillance capabilities, with profound effects on human rights, the formation of suspicion and on interactions between police and citizens.


Retrospective facial recognition (the use of facial recognition on recorded materials) is now used by every police force in the UK, and has been, in some cases, for more than a decade.

This expansion occurred under the radar and without public debate. Its extent was only revealed through investigative journalism.

Live facial recognition, which involves real-time identity checks, is also expanding. South Wales Police recently deployed this technology across Cardiff’s pedestrian areas.


And London’s Metropolitan Police are planning to install the first permanent live facial recognition cameras in the capital.


Being identified by police was once only a possibility, now it is a near certainty.

The only rules currently governing the police’s use of facial recognition are developed by police forces themselves.


In recognition of the dangers posed by such surveillance, we were recently involved in developing, with the UN, a model protocol for law enforcement.

It sets out practical guidance that all states should follow when policing protest, making clear that efforts to preserve one’s anonymity should not be treated as suspicious.

This protocol explicitly prohibits the use of remote biometric technology, like facial recognition or retina scanning, to identify protesters during peaceful demonstrations – something we argue is inconsistent with police’s obligation to facilitate peaceful protest.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nasa’s Curiosity Mars rover has detected the largest organic (carbon-containing) molecules ever found on the red planet. The discovery is one of the most significant findings in the search for evidence of past life on Mars.

These molecules could actually be fragments of fatty acids, which are found in, for example, the membranes surrounding biological cells.

Scientists think that, if life ever emerged on Mars, it was probably microbial in nature.

Because microbes are so small, it’s difficult to be definitive about any potential evidence for life found on Mars.

Such evidence needs more powerful scientific instruments that are too large to be put on a rover.

The organic molecules found by Curiosity consist of carbon atoms linked in long chains, with other elements bonded to them, like hydrogen and oxygen.

They come from a 3.7-billion-year-old rock dubbed Cumberland, encountered by the rover at a presumed dried-up lakebed in Mars’s Gale Crater.

Scientists used the Sample Analysis at Mars (Sam) instrument on the Nasa rover to make their discovery.

Among the molecules were decane, which has 10 carbon atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms, and dodecane, with 12 carbons and 26 hydrogen atoms.

These are known as alkanes, which fall under the umbrella of the chemical compounds known as hydrocarbons.

It’s an exciting time in the search for life on Mars.

In March this year, scientists presented evidence of features in a different rock sampled elsewhere on Mars by the Perseverance rover.

These features, dubbed “leopard spots” and “poppy seeds”, could have been produced by the action of microbial life in the distant past, or not.

The findings were presented at a US conference and have not yet been published in a peer reviewed journal.

The Mars Sample Return mission, a collaboration between Nasa and the European Space Agency, offers hope that samples of rock collected and stored by Perseverance could be brought to Earth for study in laboratories.

Cumberland was found in a region of Gale Crater called Yellowknife Bay.

This area contains rock formations that look suspiciously like those formed when sediment builds up at the bottom of a lake.

One of Curiosity’s scientific goals is to examine the prospect that past conditions on Mars would have been suitable for the development of life, so an ancient lakebed is the perfect place to look for them.

The researchers think that the alkane molecules may once have been components of more complex fatty acid molecules.

On Earth, fatty acids are components of fats and oils.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A district council in England has passed a motion to grant its local river the rights to flow freely, be free from pollution, and enjoy its native biodiversity.

The move by Lewes District Council in East Sussex to recognise the fundamental rights of the River Ouse is the first of its kind in the UK. The Ouse flows southwards for 35 miles into the English Channel and suffers from chemical pollution, sewage dumping, and other problems.

As a legal academic who researches exactly these sorts of rights, I was excited to see the news from Lewes (even if the council’s motions ultimately can’t overrule national laws). But simply granting a river some rights isn’t enough. We now need to think about who will actually defend these rights.

This may mean appointing someone to represent the rights of the river. Who these representatives are, and how they think about nature and conservation, can be as important as the granting of these rights in the first place.

Appointing representatives who care about their own personal and property interests would be a grave mistake, as would appointing anyone who prioritises the rights of humans to a healthy environment over a more intrinsic right of nature (remember: the idea is that the River Ouse has rights in itself and shouldn’t need to demonstrate its worth to humans).

As further rivers, lakes, forests, and more are granted rights like the Ouse, we’ll need to train up an army of people willing to represent the rights of nature.

Natural entities should have legal rights

The law professor Christopher Stone pioneered the rights of nature concept back in the 1970s. He argued that natural entities, like rivers or forests, should have legal rights and that a “guardian” or representative should be appointed to defend those rights in court when they are threatened.

Some legal systems have adopted this model. For example, in New Zealand, the Whanganui River was granted legal personhood, and two “human faces” were appointed to act and speak on its behalf. Their duties are outlined in a 2017 act, which specifies that these representatives must have the skills, knowledge, and experience needed to effectively advocate for the river’s rights.

But even as rights of nature are being considered in many countries, there is still little consideration of who will represent these rights effectively. For instance, back in 2008 Ecuador became the first country to grant the rights of nature in its constitution.

However, the constitution states that “all persons” are representatives of the rights of nature. This is simply impractical: we can’t expect every citizen to truly care about the rights of nature.

Efforts to apply the rights of nature in Ecuador have often failed. Legal challenges can become highly politicised and there is little legal infrastructure beyond general constitutional principles.

For example, in a case brought after road builders had dumped material into the Vilcabamba River, plaintiffs claimed to represent nature in court. However, they were not genuinely advocating for the river’s rights – their main concern was protecting their downstream property.

An ecocentric perspective

Ultimately, defending the rights of nature in court will be a struggle if the nature in question – the river, forest, or lake – is not represented by someone with an ecocentric perspective. That means prioritising the intrinsic value of nature itself, rather than focusing on how it can serve human interests.

Ecocentric advocates have proved to be the most effective defenders of the rights of nature in many court cases. For example, in lawsuits involving Ecuador’s Los Cedros cloud forest and its marine ecosystems, ecocentric arguments helped secure stronger legal protections and even inspired the courts to grant further rights of nature.

One of the most common legal frameworks involves appointing “all persons”, “a person”, or “a resident” as representatives or protectors. For instance, Uganda’s National Environment Act 2019 states that anyone has the right to bring an action before a court “for any infringement of rights of nature”.

Similarly, the city of Toledo, Ohio, tried to introduce the Lake Erie bill of rights which stated that the city or any resident could act on its behalf.

Moves to give rights to nature are promising. But from Colombia to Canada to Sussex, we’ll need a whole army of nature protectors to actually enforce those rights.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alzheimer’s disease is usually associated with old age, but around 5%-10% of all Alzheimer’s cases occur in people under the age of 65.

Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease progresses more rapidly and often strikes people in the prime of their lives. Treatment options remain limited.

The recent clinical trial was a randomised, placebo-controlled study to evaluate gantenerumab’s effects on people with early-onset Alzheimer’s. Researchers monitored changes in the participants’ cognitive abilities, and also used brain imaging and blood biomarkers (the presence of specific proteins in the blood which are linked to Alzheimer’s), to track the disease’s progress throughout the study.

The trial included 73 participants with rare inherited genetic mutations known to cause early-onset Alzheimer’s. These participants were either asymptomatic or had mild Alzheimer’s symptoms at the start of the study.

Gantenerumab is a monoclonal antibody – a lab-engineered protein designed to attach to amyloid beta in the brain. By binding to these plaques, it signals the immune system to clear them away. This may potentially slow Alzheimer’s progression.

The drug works by engaging microglial cells. These are the brain’s primary immune defenders. Microglia constantly monitor the brain for damage and remove harmful substances, including amyloid beta. However, in people with Alzheimer’s disease, microglia often fail to clear plaques efficiently. Gantenerumab enhances this natural defence mechanism by tagging amyloid plaques, making them easier for the microglia to recognise and break down.

Amyloid beta is thought to play a central role in Alzheimer’s by triggering inflammation, interfering with cell communication and ultimately killing neurons. By removing these plaques, gantenerumab may help to protect brain function.

An advantage of gantenerumab is that it can cross the blood-brain barrier – the protective shield that blocks many drugs and harmful substances from reaching the brain. This allows it to act directly on amyloid plaques, making it more effective than some earlier treatments that struggled with drug delivery.

But as promising as these results are, gantenerumab isn’t without risks. A major concern is amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. These are swelling or small spots of bleeding in the brain that show up on MRI scans.

In this latest trial, 53% of participants experienced these amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, including small brain bleeds in 27% of participants, brain swelling in 30% of participants and iron deposits from bleeding in 6%. While no participants had major brain haemorrhages or died from the treatment, these side-effects remain a serious concern – requiring regular monitoring through brain scans.

Gantenerumab is also expensive to manufacture, which could make widespread access difficult if it gains regulatory approval. As this is an experimental drug, we do not currently know how much it would cost. But other similar anti-amyloid therapies, such as donanemab, currently cost around £25,000 per patient per year.

The study also had a small sample size and only focused on a rare genetic form of early-onset Alzheimer’s. More research is needed to see how these results may apply to the wider dementia community.

According to the amyloid hypothesis, the buildup of amyloid plaques in the brain is the main cause of Alzheimer’s disease. Clearing these plaques will slow the disease’s progression. The success of the Alzheimer’s drugs lecanemab, donanemab and now gantenerumab, lend themselves to this theory.

This study also underscores the importance of early diagnosis. Amyloid-targeting therapies appear to work best in the early stages of Alzheimer’s, before significant brain damage occurs. Advances in biomarker testing – including blood tests and brain scans – could help identify at-risk people sooner. This would improve the effectiveness of drugs such as gantenerumab.

Alzheimer’s research is advancing faster than ever before. Whether a success or a setback, each new study adds to our understanding of the disease and brings us closer to more effective treatments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On a warm and sunny May bank holiday in 2003, I had one of those rare days that truly changes your life forever.

I was 38, single and broke. This pregnancy was the result of a brief relationship which had only amounted to four dates. Shell-shocked as I was, I laughed out loud in a moment of joy I knew there was no coming back from. Nine months later I gave birth to my son Jim.

My old Nokia still holds the text thread of the three years I was in touch with Jim’s dad. My messages began “I had a great time last night”, and ended “Have you got the results yet?” He had requested a paternity test when Jim was two. A week later we both received the results. The probability that he was Jim’s biological dad was 99.99%. This news prompted a final reply from Jim’s dad: “Yes, I got the results … I’m moving to Spain.”

We didn’t hear from him again for over a decade. Unable to combine motherhood with my previous career as a TV director, I quit my job overnight. I got a job teaching filmmaking and was out of the film industry for over a decade.

I began filming my son Jim as he grew up. I recorded hundreds of hours of footage, capturing each twist and turn in Jim’s life, from the thumbs-up he gave me during my first scan, to his first day at college.

Jim is 21 now. Filmed over 20 years, my feature documentary Motherboard charts the highs and lows of solo motherhood. It explores how Jim and I navigated him meeting his dad for the first time at 13, closely followed by my breast cancer diagnosis and Jim’s party-hard late teens, when tempers frayed and doors slammed.

When I was making Motherboard I burnt through any books, films and TV that I could find, exploring solo motherhood. Many repeated the same old tabloid cliches and movie tropes of single mums. They were victims or martyrs, their only moment of joy watching the sun set over their estate before the bailiffs turned up.

Author Jessi Klein writes that: “Motherhood as a story, is so infrequently told, because the world tells us that what mothers do is unremarkable and unimportant.” She goes on to explore the structure of the hero’s epic journey in Hollywood blockbusters. 

In I’ll Show Myself Out: Essays on Midlife and Motherhood (2022), author Jessi Klein writes that: “Motherhood as a story, is so infrequently told, because the world tells us that what mothers do is unremarkable and unimportant.” She goes on to explore the structure of the hero’s epic journey in Hollywood blockbusters, in which the (usually male) hero embarks on a quest and returns home transformed.

Klein turns this formula on its head. “Motherhood is a hero’s journey, it’s not a journey outwards to the most fantastic, farest-flung places, but about how she stays.”

I listened to a podcast recently in which Adlon challenged the words that are often used to describe Better Things. “Brave”, “raw” and “vulnerable” come up constantly.

Critics and audiences often tell me that I’m brave. It can feel condescending. I’ve never heard the word attributed to Linklater’s Boyhood. What sets myself and Adlon apart from Linklater, is that we are both single mothers ourselves.

As politicians continue to obsess over the recent statistic that “more boys have smartphones than dads”, families with absent fathers will continue to be seen as tragic and flawed. But single mothers are not a problem to be solved.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UK government has set out plans in a green paper to improve access to effective employment support for people with mental health problems.

The government recently introduced controversial reforms to health and disability benefits, as part of Chancellor Rachel Reeves's spring statement.

As a social researcher, listening closely to people's lived experiences has taught that while their distress is genuine, significant and at times severe, it is rarely the whole story of what is constraining their ability to find and stay in work.

Mental distress is almost invariably bound up in other challenging circumstances that also pose barriers to work – issues such as homelessness, violence and abuse, caring commitments, lone parenthood, poverty, involvement with the criminal justice system, and the obstacles caused by inflexible employers and insecure work.


The work capability assessment (WCA) was introduced 17 years ago to determine how far and in what ways someone's disability, illness or health condition limits them from working.

Since then, welfare support has been narrowed down to questions of obligation and conditionality – with health as the central focus.


The UK government is planning to scrap the WCA and introduce a new kind of “support conversation”, which aims to bring a broader range of factors back into the picture when assessing capacity for work.

This shift in approach recognises that discussions about work need to include a better understanding of people's goals and aspirations, and facilitate access to support for debt, housing, careers, training and social connection.


A recent workshop explored the opportunities and challenges that might arise from this more holistic approach to assessing capacity for work.

Participants felt there was potential for more positive experiences and effective support, but also envisaged risks for claimants and welfare services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new type of flat, razor-thin telescope lens could transform deep-space stargazing by making it possible to mount lightweight but powerful telescopes onto aircraft and satellites.

Refractor telescopes normally use curved lenses to magnify distant objects through a process called refraction. Similar to a magnifying glass, the curved lens of a telescope bends light and directs it to a focal point, making objects appear larger.

However, traditional lenses quickly become impractical for space telescopes studying stars or galaxies millions of light years away. This is because the further away an object is, the more magnification is required to bring it into focus, and therefore the thicker and heavier the lens needs to be.

That's why scientists have explored flat lenses, which should in theory be lighter and less bulky. The challenge with them, however, is that light interacts with them differently than with curved lenses.

Visible light is a type of electromagnetic radiation, which is transmitted in waves or particles at different wavelengths and frequencies. When light passes through a flat lens, it diffracts, scattering wavelengths in multiple directions and resulting in a blurry, unfocused image.

But a new "multilevel diffractive lens" (MDL) developed by scientists features a multi-level structure consisting of "microscopically small concentric rings." These effectively channel different wavelengths of light towards the same focal point to create a sharp, color-accurate image.

The new 100-millimeter (3.9-inch) diameter lens, which has a 200 mm (7.8 in) focal length, is just 2.4 micrometers thick. Optimized for the 400 to 800 nm wavelength range for visible light, this lens is much lighter than a conventional curved lens and eliminates color distortions.

The scientists published their findings Feb. 3 in the journal Applied Physics Letters. The study was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), NASA and the Office of Naval Research.

Scientists have designed flat lenses in the past, most notably the fresnel zone plate (FZP), which features concentric ridges etched across the surface. However, the ridges of FZPs break light into separate wavelengths and diffract them at different angles, resulting in color distortions.

The MDL is unique in that its concentric rings exist at varying depths within the lens itself. As light passes through, the microscopic indentations adjust how different wavelengths diffract, preventing them from spreading apart as they normally would. This controlled diffraction brings all wavelengths of light into focus at the same time, resulting in a sharper, color-accurate image.

The researchers used the MDL to capture images of the sun and moon. Lunar images they took revealed key geological features, while they also used it in solar imaging to capture visible sunspots.

"Simulating the performance of these lenses over a very large bandwidth, from visible to near-infrared, involved solving complex computational problems involving very large datasets," Majumder said. "Once we optimized the design of the lens' microstructures, the manufacturing process required very stringent process control and environmental stability."

The researchers said the technology had applications in astronomy, astrophotography and other "long-range imaging tasks" including "airborne and space-based imaging applications."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly every modern medical treatment can be traced to research funded by the National Institutes of Health: from over-the-counter and prescription medications that treat high cholesterol and pain to protection from infectious diseases such as polio and smallpox.

The remarkable successes of the decades-old partnership between biomedical research institutions and the federal government are so intertwined with daily life that it’s easy to take them for granted.

However, the scientific work driving these medical advances and breakthroughs is in jeopardy. Federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation are terminating hundreds of active research grants under the current administration’s direction.

The negative consequences of defunding U.S. biomedical research can be difficult to recognize. Most breakthroughs, from the basic science discoveries that reveal the causes of diseases to the development of effective treatments and cures, can take years. Real-time progress can be hard to measure.

As biomedical researchers studying infectious diseases, viruses and immunology, we and our colleagues see this firsthand in our own work. Thousands of ongoing national and international projects dedicated to uncovering the causes of life-threatening diseases and developing new treatments to improve and save lives are supported by federal agencies such as the NIH and NSF.

Considering a few of the breakthroughs made possible through U.S. federal support can help illustrate not only the significant inroads being made but also the potential for loss if funding is cut back.

A cure for cancer has been elusive, but research funded by the National Institutes of Health has shown promise. Already, nearly 41% of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime, and nearly 11% with Alzheimer’s.

About 1 in 5 Americans will die from heart disease, and nearly 1.4 million will be rushed to an emergency room due to pneumonia from an infectious disease.

Defunding biomedical research will result in a cascade of effects. There will likely be fewer clinical trials, fewer new treatments and fewer lifesaving drugs.

Labs will likely shut down, jobs will be lost, and the process of discovery will stall. The U.S.’s health care system, economy and standing as the world’s leader in scientific innovation will likely decline.

Moreover, when the pipelines of scientific progress are turned off, they will not so easily be turned back on. These consequences will affect all Americans and the rest of the world for decades.

University shortfalls directly resulting from cuts to research support will dramatically reduce the capacity of American institutions to educate and provide opportunities for the next generation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>mice that resemble woolly mammoths have been created through gene editing.

The mice were made by altering an Asian elephant in ways that superficially resemble a woolly mammoth, but any attempt to do so will probably miss innumerable genetic flourishes that made woolly mammoths a unique species.

A mammoth is not an elephant in a fur coat.


Researchers are skeptical about bringing back woolly mammoths because we still don't know what makes a mammoth a mammoth.

The candidate genes for mammoth fur types and cold adaptation are really exciting and interesting, but genes are complicated and one gene can affect many things.


Research has already been done on growing elephant cells in cultures and testing how those cells respond to changes in gene expression.

This allows the team to learn more about which genes to target without having to grow or experiment on a whole elephant.


Creating an Asian elephant with transgenic DNA will be difficult because Asian elephants are classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Asian elephant gestation can last up to 22 months, meaning the process to create just one transgenic elephant will take significantly longer than that of woolly mice.


The habitat that mammoths once roamed has changed quite a bit since the Pleistocene epoch, which ended 11,700 years ago.

Modern day ecosystems in those northerly regions are less productive and diverse because mammoths were keystone species that changed their environment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The sun will go partially dark tomorrow for millions of people as a partial solar eclipse blocks out a chunk of our star.

This astronomical phenomenon will fall on Saturday, March 29, 2025, and will be visible in 13 U.S. states, parts of northeastern Canada, and across much of western Europe and Africa.


To help you find out if your location is in the path of the eclipse, NASA has now released a map revealing exactly how much of the sun will be eclipsed and where, and what time the eclipse begins in each region.

The East Coast of the U.S. and Canada will see the partial eclipse take over the largest portion of the sun, with 83% of the sun being blocked out in St John's in Canada, 64% in Portland, Maine, 43% in Boston, and 22% in New York City, according to NASA.

A full-size version of the map is available.


On the NASA map, the yellow lines show the extent of how much sun will appear to be blocked out from each location, and the green lines track the time in UTC at which the eclipse will hit its peak.

In St. John’s, Canada, for example, the partial eclipse will begin at 6:57 a.m. local time, peak at 7:52 a.m., and end at 8:51 a.m.

In Boston, it will start at 6:31 a.m. local time, peak at 6:38 a.m. and end at 7:07 a.m., while in New York City, it will start at 6:44 a.m., peak at 6:46 a.m., and end at 7:04 a.m.

In London, meanwhile, where the eclipse will cover a maximum of 31% of the sun, the eclipse will start at 10:07 a.m. local time, peak at 11:03 a.m., and end at 12:00 p.m.


Solar eclipses occur when the moon passes between the Earth and the sun, blocking out the light from our star and casting a shadow on the Earth's surface.

Unlike a total solar eclipse, where the sun is completely blocked in some areas, a partial eclipse results in the sun appearing as a crescent in the sky.

This occurs because the alignment between the sun, moon, and Earth is not perfect.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Incredibly rare footage has captured a mother snow leopard and her three cubs trudging through thick snow in the mountains of northern Pakistan.

Sakhawat Ali, a gamekeeper at the Central Karakoram National Park in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan, spotted the elusive animals on March 13 in a remote village called Hushe after two weeks of tracking their pugmarks.


Snow leopards (Panthera uncia) are an elusive species of big cat that can be found in mountainous areas across 12 countries in Central and Eastern Asia, and sightings are exceedingly rare. Their white coats render them almost invisible against the snowy mountains they call home, and more than 70% of their habitat remains unexplored, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).


Since late February, Ali said he had been noticing snow leopard pugmarks around the village. "While I was on the roof of my house, I used binoculars to observe the mountains and spotted a female snow leopard along with her four cubs," he said.


Snow leopards are usually solo travellers, so seeing four together is exceedingly rare.

Female snow leopards typically have between one and five cubs with each litter, according to WWF. At three months old, the cubs begin to follow their mother out of their dens to learn how to hunt in their environment.


The big cats are considered vulnerable to extinction, with only 4,000 to 6,000 individuals left worldwide, according to WWF estimates.

The Baltistan Wildlife Conservation and Development Organization (BWCDO), which shared Ali's video on Facebook, said the sighting was a positive sign of successful conservation efforts in the Hushe Valley area.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pilots in Star Wars enter a dimension, hyperspace, to travel between distant worlds. To merge onto this cosmic highway, ships are equipped with special engines called hyperdrives. With the push of a lever, the spacecraft zooms faster than the speed of light, traversing between star systems in just hours or days.

But Star Wars breaks the laws of physics to achieve such a feat. Off-screen, the technology to reach another star system doesn’t yet exist. However, emerging propulsion methods could brighten the future of interstellar travel. Due to the nature of light and energy, it’s impossible to reach the speed of light, nearly 300,000 kilometers per second.

It would take an infinite amount of energy. The fastest any human-made object has traveled is only about 0.06 percent of that speed. At that rate, it would take about 6,600 years to reach the nearest exoplanet, Proxima Centauri b, 4.24 light-years away.

A spacecraft traveling at one-tenth of the speed of light could shave the trip down to a quick 40 years. Future engineers could use nuclear power to achieve that, says Scott Bailey, an engineer at Virginia Tech. But developing that technology could take thousands of years.

Controlled fusion could help, says Cole Miller, an astronomer at the University of Maryland in College Park. Controlled fusion harnesses energy from combining atomic nuclei to create a steady supply of power. Researchers have been working on controlled fusion for about 70 years.

But so far, these experiments have yet to produce more energy than they consume. Not all vehicles in the Star Wars universe rely on hyperdrives; some“sun jammers” have huge sails that catch stellar winds — the constant stream of charged particles produced by stars — to move through space like a ship on the sea.

Recently, the nonprofit Planetary Society tested a similar concept. The crowdfunded LightSail 2 launched in 2019 and orbited Earth for about three years. Rather than relying on solar wind, though, the small craft’s solar sails used pressure from sunlight itself.

Although light doesn’t have mass, it does have momentum. The solar sails intercepted sunlight with thin sheets made of reflective Mylar and other polymers. When speeding photons hit the sail, they bounced.

Using solar sails to propel a large spacecraft would be tough, Miller says. The thrust produced probably wouldn’t be strong enough to carry ships ferrying humans. Upscaling solar sails would offer unique benefits, however.

Using sunlight would allow a spaceship to accelerate without fuel. And unlike objects on Earth, spacecraft aren’t slowed by air friction produced by an atmosphere. This would allow any spacecraft to continue gaining speed as long as it’s exposed to sunlight.

For now, spacefarers aren’t looking to travel to another star system. But even travel within the solar system, say, to Mars, could use a boost. To safely bring people to and from the Red Planet, some researchers are looking to ion engines.

These thrusters create force by shooting charged atoms from the back of a spacecraft. Star Wars’ TIE Fighters, like the one flown by Darth Vader, navigate through space battles with them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nothing is certain in the quantum realm. A particle, for example, can exist in multiple quantum states simultaneously. The same goes for a quantum bit, or qubit — the basic unit of information used in quantum computing. The act of measurement causes these objects to collapse into a single state, and usually the best you can do is calculate the probability of a particular outcome.

The unpredictability at the heart of the quantum realm has been immensely useful for computing and cryptography, where experts have learned to harness randomness as a tool. But as useful as it is for quantum circuits to incorporate true randomness, it’s a difficult state to achieve, with steep costs. “Generating randomness is pretty expensive,” said William Kretschmer, a researcher at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing who studies quantum complexity.

As a result, quantum researchers have long wanted to see if they could possibly fake that randomness. They wanted to build “pseudorandom” quantum circuits, which seem to be truly random but can nonetheless be constructed relatively simply and manageably. The only problem was that no one knew if it was possible to actually build one.

After years of uncertainty, two researchers posted a paper last October that proved that it is in fact possible to construct such a circuit. Their work provides an elegant and secure way to represent quantum randomness that’s indistinguishable from the real thing, without the enormous computational load — though it’s only possible in a world where some basic theoretical assumptions of cryptography are correct.

The proof could open new doors for quantum computing and cryptography research. “Before this recent result on pseudorandom [circuits], we didn’t have good evidence that they actually exist,” said Alexander Poremba, a quantum computing researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved with the new paper.

Traditionally, researchers who want to represent randomness in their quantum computations have needed to keep track of every possible configuration of a quantum state. They’ve done the bookkeeping using a mathematical object called a Haar-random unitary, named after the Hungarian mathematician Alfréd Haar. These are thorough descriptions, and in the case of qubits, the possibilities grow exponentially.

So while a Haar-random unitary for a small number of qubits is feasible to compute, it becomes practically impossible with many qubits. This difficulty has hindered experiments that rely on these states. A team at Google, however, was able to achieve “quantum supremacy” by simulating quantum Haar-random states in 2019.

The new proof for the construction of PRUs could enable similar experiments in the future at a fraction of the computational cost. These constructions are “actually very important for quantum technology as a whole,” Huang said.

The proof also provides physicists with a new method for studying black holes. Researchers have often modeled them using Haar-random unitaries, but the exponential complexity of these models doesn’t seem to conform with the behavior of black holes.

Physicists have therefore begun to wonder whether black holes might in fact just seem random, while actually emerging from a relatively simple process — in other words, they could be more like pseudorandom unitaries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It’s an iconic image: A polar bear perched on a lone ice cap, drifting at sea. Is that the fate climate change has in store for this powerful Arctic inhabitant? In 2004, the discovery of a fossil polar bear jaw on Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago, suggested another possibility.

The fossil came from a bear that lived over 120,000 years ago and was found to have a unique adaptation to survive in a warmer climate. This suggests that polar bears may be able to adapt to changing temperatures. The discovery also raised questions about the relationship between climate change and the survival of polar bears.

A scientist studying the fossil suggested that polar bears could migrate to other parts of the world if their Arctic habitat becomes too warm. However, this would require significant changes in their behavior and physiology. 

The article then shifts its focus to the natural history of polar regions, discussing how glacial ice can be more than one thing at a time in various places: part liquid, part solid; it can melt, bend, refreeze, and even act like a gel.

It defies simple explanations, and scientists have found that different languages use different combinations of words and phrases to describe various properties and characteristics of ice. The Inuktitut language, for example, uses specific words to describe the texture and behavior of ice in different contexts.

The article then discusses the adaptation of plants, insects, and animals to polar temperatures. Scientists have discovered fascinating proteins that allow certain fish to survive in icy waters by preventing ice crystals from growing and damaging cells.

One scientist found a protein in the blood of an icefish that was almost identical to a digestive protein in its liver. With a few small mutations over time, this liver protein was repurposed into an antifreeze in the ancestors of icefish.

These kinds of "antifreeze compounds have been discovered in different fish, insects, plants, and fungi living in both the northern and southern polar regions." The poles don't only provide clues to life on Earth; they also hold a glimpse into the history of the universe.

Since the first meteorite was discovered in Antarctica in 1912, more than 50,000 others have been recovered from the Antarctic. These small meteorites hold the material that swirled around the sun prior to the formation of the planets and asteroids.

The components of the meteorites reflect the brick and mortar of our part of the solar system, the basic ingredients that went into the making of our planet and others.

Glacial ice can be more than one thing at a time in various places: part liquid, part solid; it can melt, bend, refreeze, and even act like a gel. It defies simple explanations.

The article then addresses the impact of global warming on polar regions, noting that permafrost makes up approximately 15 percent of the Northern Hemisphere. When it melts, the results can be devastating: "Melting permafrost changes the landscape because liquid water takes up less volume than ice."

When ice thaws, the ground above buckles and a crater can appear at the surface. One such crater in Batagay, in far eastern Russia, started to form in the 1970s and is now nearly a half mile long and expanding by as much as 20 feet each year.

Arctic communities are learning to adapt as best they can ⏤ a strategy that includes relocation. Encroaching water and land erosion has already forced some Alaskan villages to undergo the complicated process of moving an entire town, made more complex by the remote location.

The community of Newtok successfully lobbied the Federal Emergency Management Agency to secure federal funds to help establish a new village, but constructing housing remains a challenge. In December 2024, with nearly 20 families living in temporary tiny houses at the new townsite, critical infrastructure in Newtok was turned off as the last of nearly 400 residents finished packing their belongings.

As the article concludes, it highlights how polar regions present extreme challenges not only to humans but also to all living things. Yet, through adaptation, life finds a way.</p>
