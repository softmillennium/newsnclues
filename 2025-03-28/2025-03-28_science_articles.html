Fossils of 444 million-year-old creatures whose bodies were preserved "inside-out" have been discovered in South Africa.

Scientists have found two specimens of a 444 million-year-old "inside-out" fossil with well-preserved soft tissue, according to a new study. Unlike most fossils, the creature's muscles and guts — but not its more durable shell — are preserved in ancient sediment that turned to stone.

The fossil, found 250 miles (402 kilometers) north of Cape Town in South Africa, is a new species of multisegmented arthropod that may have lived in oxygen-poor waters, according to the study, published March 26 in the journal Papers in Palaeontology.

Researchers named the new species Keurbos susanae and nicknamed the fossil "Sue" after its discoverer's mom.

"Sue is an inside-out, legless, headless wonder," lead author Sarah Gabbott, a paleontologist at the University of Leicester in the U.K., said in a statement. "Remarkably, her insides are a mineralized time-capsule: muscles, sinews, tendons and even guts all preserved in unimaginable detail. And yet her durable carapace, legs and head are missing — lost to decay over 440 million years ago."

The researchers found the fossils in the Soom Shale, a site known for producing fossils with well-preserved soft tissues, more than 20 years ago. They had hoped to find additional specimens, but fossils of the species turned out to be quite rare. The silt, clay, and mud in which Sue was preserved were deposited on an ancient seafloor, beneath an ocean low in oxygen but high in dissolved, acidic hydrogen sulfide — suggesting that K. susanae may have been adapted for a low-oxygen environment.



Sue dates back to the Late Ordovician mass extinction (443 million years ago), when cold temperatures and glacier advancement eliminated nearly 85% of marine species.

Researchers are still working to understand how soft tissues in fossils like K. susanae are preserved in the Soom Shale. Clay minerals may have played a role, as could calcium phosphate, a compound commonly found in fossilized muscles. On the other hand, the shells and exoskeletons of species preserved in Soom Shale likely dissolved in the acidic ocean.

Because the K. susanae specimen was fossilized inside out, scientists still aren't sure of the species' evolutionary history or how it compares to other fossils from the same time period.

"We are now sure she was a primitive marine arthropod, but her precise evolutionary relationships remain frustratingly elusive," Gabbott said in the statement. The fossil's segmented trunk suggests it had limbs of some kind — but comparing Sue to known fossil species would require a sample with part of the exoskeleton preserved.

Recent quarrying activity has buried the site where Gabbott and her colleagues found Sue, so it's unlikely they'll find other examples of the same species with intact legs or a head, the team said.

"I'd always hoped to find new specimens, but it seems after 25 years of searching this fossil is vanishingly rare — so I can hang on no longer," Gabbott said. "Especially as recently my mum said to me, 'Sarah, if you are going to name this fossil after me, you'd better get on and do it before I am in the ground and fossilized myself'."

Gabbott joked that she named the fossil after her mom because she's a "well-preserved specimen." But the true reason, she said, is that "my mum always said I should follow a career that makes me happy — whatever that may be. For me that is digging rocks, finding fossils and then trying to figure out how they lived what they tell us about ancient life and evolution on Earth."

	Success with mice does not guarantee success with elephants

Cute, yes. But is this “woolly mouse” really a step toward bringing woolly mammoths back?

Colossal Bioscience

By Jason Bittel

5 hours ago

Scientists working to unlock the secrets of de-extinction recently announced what they say is a turning point for the movement: the creation of transgenic mice with long, luxurious golden locks of tufted fur inspired by the coats of woolly mammoths.

They're called Colossal woolly mice. And yes, they are cute to boot.

Transgenic mice — those that have had their genomes altered through genetic engineering — are not new. But what's novel is the ability to engineer eight edits across seven genes and to do so simultaneously in one animal. The researchers also note that across three experiments, each of which used different combinations of edits, the method worked with high efficiency, resulting in living animals that presented the traits they were bred for.

In other words, the scientists have shown not only that they can make woolly mice, but also that they can do so reliably and repeatedly — a necessity for the project's next steps.

“That's been overlooked [in the immediate aftermath of the announcement] as far as how actually big of a deal that is in genetic engineering,” says Beth Shapiro, chief science officer at Colossal Biosciences in Dallas. She and her colleagues described the team's findings in a paper posted March 4 at bioRxiv.org.

In all, the team created 32 woolly mice, each of which varied slightly in appearance, but reflected the traits the scientists predicted. Shapiro says there were no misfires or surprises in the lot. “Other than that they were so absurdly adorable,” she says.

But what do a few extra-furry mice have to do with bringing mammoths back from extinction? That part is a little more complicated and has led to misunderstandings since the findings were announced. For instance, the New York Post described the woolly mouse as a new species — it isn't — and one post on X with millions of views stated that the scientists “spliced woolly mammoth genes into mice,” which is also not true.

“We did not want to take elephant genes and shove them into a mouse,” Shapiro says, “because that wouldn't make any sense.”

To create the woolly mouse, scientists analyzed the genetic instructions, or genomes, of 121 mammoth and elephant samples to identify genes that may have given woolly mammoths some of their characteristic traits. These include longer, thicker, golden hair, as well as genes associated with lipid metabolism and fatty acid absorption for a life spent in the bitter cold.

“We can do a lot with the mammoth genomes we have. We can line them up on a computer and compare them to elephant genomes and ask where all the mammoths are the same as each other but different from their elephant cousins,” says Shapiro, who is also an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Using these hints about what makes a mammoth a mammoth, the scientists searched for similar traits in mice, either naturally occurring or achievable through genetic engineering. Mice are much easier to work with than elephants, of course. The tiny rodents require little space, breed quickly and have already been extensively studied with regards to their genetics. For instance, scientists have known since 1994 that if you turn off the FGF5 gene, mice will grow much longer hair than usual. Similarly, a gene known as Mc1r makes mice blond, while Frzd6 makes that hair whorly and frizzled.

The final step was transforming edited embryos into living, breathing, gloriously furred mice.

“Of course, mice are not elephants, which people have helpfully pointed out to us, as if we didn't know that,” says Shapiro, referring to some common critiques her team has received.

This is why, she says, the woolly mice are just one part of the de-extinction goal. Colossal Biosciences, founded in 2021, has also been experimenting directly with Asian elephant cells, because that species is most closely related to extinct woolly mammoths.

Another arm of research focuses on the artificial reproductive techniques necessary to implant a genetically modified elephant embryo into a living elephant and then bring that animal to term. Similarly, the scientists are also working on de-extinction projects for the dodo and a wolflike marsupial known as the thylacine.

“All of this work is happening simultaneously,” Shapiro says.

Jacquelyn Gill, an ice age ecologist at the University of Maine in Orono, does not hide her excitement about the idea of seeing a woolly mammoth in person one day.

“I understand why someone would be compelled to see a mammoth,” Gill says. “I've never seen my study system in person, right? It only exists in my mind's eye, because I study a past that is gone.”

Nor does she reject the idea of de-extinction outright. In fact, Gill says, “the science of de-extinction is exciting and has broad applications.”

However, she is skeptical that what Colossal Biosciences is pursuing will qualify as bringing a woolly mammoth back from the dead.

For starters, despite the discovery of many well-preserved mammoth remains in permafrost —some complete with fur, muscles and skin — thousands of years buried in ice have destroyed every cell. This degradation means researchers cannot clone a mammoth, as has already been achieved in sheep.

“That's a whole pathway to cloning that is cut off from us,” Gill says.

While gene editing may allow altering an Asian elephant in ways that superficially resemble a woolly mammoth, any attempt to do so will probably miss innumerable genetic flourishes that made woolly mammoths a unique species.

“A mammoth is not an elephant in a fur coat,” says Tori Herridge, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sheffield in England.

While Herridge finds the candidate genes for mammoth fur types and cold adaptation “really exciting and interesting,” she cautions that we still don't know “what makes a mammoth a mammoth.”

“We all know that genes are complicated,” Herridge says. “One gene can affect many things, and many genes can act in concert.” Furthermore, she says, researchers don't yet know if the genes used to dictate hair length, texture or color in the woolly mice will produce the same effects in Asian elephants.

Some troubleshooting can be done in the lab, Shapiro says. For instance, the team is already growing elephant cells in cultures and then testing how those cells respond to things like changes in gene expression. This allows Colossal to learn more about which genes to target without having to grow or experiment on a whole elephant.

The team has also already created elephant pluripotent stem cells, which could potentially be used to create any kind of cell — a crucial step toward assisted reproduction and the ultimate goal of implanting a transgenic elephant embryo into a living host.

Complicating this step is the fact that Asian elephant gestation can last up to about 22 months, meaning the process to create just one transgenic elephant will take significantly longer than that of woolly mice, which are pregnant for just 18 to 21 days. Moreover, Asian elephants are classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which will probably restrict how this process unfolds.

Even assuming that all of this will one day be possible, and in numbers sufficient to create a viable woolly mammoth–like herd, other questions remain. For instance, scientists have shown that modern-day elephants are complex animals with established social and cultural knowledge that gets passed down through generations.

“You can't teach a transgenic elephant how to be a woolly mammoth,” Gill says. 

And the habitat that mammoths once roamed has changed quite a bit since the Pleistocene epoch, which ended 11,700 years ago.

Back then, the tundra would have been covered in life, Gill says, much like today's Serengeti. Scientists call this biome, once the most widespread on earth, the mammoth steppe. But modern day ecosystems in those northerly regions are less productive and diverse, Gill says. Interestingly, this may have occurred because mammoths were keystone species that changed their environment. The mammoths made the mammoth steppe, in other words. And when mammoths disappeared, the ecosystem disappeared with them.

But if mammoths made an ecosystem once, perhaps they could do it again. De-extincted mammoths could, in theory, reengineer an ecosystem in ways beneficial to them, Gill says. And that theoretical capability is key to one of Colossal Bioscience's goals: Bring back herds of mammoths that will stamp down permafrost and help keep carbon stored in the ground, protecting against further climate change.

“The problem is we don't actually know if that's possible,” Gill says.

For her part, Shapiro acknowledges the legitimate criticisms of Colossal Biosciences' goals but remains optimistic about the future. In fact, one of the company's other projects might succeed first: Bringing back the dodo.

After all, while bird genetics present their own litany of challenges, there's a lot to be said for an animal that requires an egg rather than a surrogate mother, she quips.

And while Colossal Biosciences' founder, Ben Lamm, has stated that he wants to see woolly mammoth calves on the ground by 2028, Shapiro has always stressed that genetics is just one part of the equation.

“We will have elephant cells that are edited and ready to go in early '27, which is what we would need to have something on the ground in 2028,” Shapiro says. “But then there's a lot of hard biology that still hasn't been solved that needs to be solved.”

Scientists have developed an impossibly thin telescope lens that addresses a key astronomical challenge in a new study funded by NASA and DARPA.

A new type of flat, razor-thin telescope lens could transform deep-space stargazing by making it possible to mount lightweight but powerful telescopes onto aircraft and satellites, scientists say.

Refractor telescopes normally use curved lenses to magnify distant objects through a process called refraction. Similar to a magnifying glass, the curved lens of a telescope bends light and directs it to a focal point, making objects appear larger.

However, traditional lenses quickly become impractical for space telescopes studying stars or galaxies millions of light years away. This is because the further away an object is, the more magnification is required to bring it into focus, and therefore the thicker and heavier the lens needs to be.

That's why scientists have explored flat lenses, which should in theory be lighter and less bulky. The challenge with them, however, is that light interacts with them differently than with curved lenses.

Visible light is a type of electromagnetic radiation, which is transmitted in waves or particles at different wavelengths and frequencies. When light passes through a flat lens, it diffracts, scattering wavelengths in multiple directions and resulting in a blurry, unfocused image.

But a new "multilevel diffractive lens" (MDL) developed by scientists features a multi-level structure consisting of "microscopically small concentric rings." These effectively channel different wavelengths of light towards the same focal point to create a sharp, color-accurate image.

The new 100-millimeter (3.9-inch) diameter lens, which has a 200 mm (7.8 in) focal length, is just 2.4 micrometers thick. Optimized for the 400 to 800 nm wavelength range for visible light, this lens is much lighter than a conventional curved lens and eliminates color distortions.

The scientists published their findings Feb. 3 in the journal Applied Physics Letters. The study was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), NASA and the Office of Naval Research.

"Our demonstration is a stepping stone towards creating very large aperture lightweight flat lenses with the capability of capturing full-color images for use in air- and space-based telescopes," lead study author Apratim Majumder, assistant professor in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Utah, said in a statement.



Scientists have designed flat lenses in the past, most notably the fresnel zone plate (FZP), which features concentric ridges etched across the surface. However, the ridges of FZPs break light into separate wavelengths and diffract them at different angles, resulting in color distortions.

The MDL is unique in that its concentric rings exist at varying depths within the lens itself. As light passes through, the microscopic indentations adjust how different wavelengths diffract, preventing them from spreading apart as they normally would. This controlled diffraction brings all wavelengths of light into focus at the same time, resulting in a sharper, color-accurate image.

As well as avoiding the color distortions of FZPs, the researchers said the new flat lens offered the same light-bending power as traditional curved lenses. In the study, they used the MDL to capture images of the sun and moon. Lunar images they took revealed key geological features, while they also used it in solar imaging to capture visible sunspots.

"Simulating the performance of these lenses over a very large bandwidth, from visible to near-infrared, involved solving complex computational problems involving very large datasets," Majumder said in the statement. "Once we optimized the design of the lens' microstructures, the manufacturing process required very stringent process control and environmental stability."

The researchers said the technology had applications in astronomy, astrophotography and other "long-range imaging tasks" including "airborne and space-based imaging applications." What's more, production may not be far off.

"Our computational techniques suggested we could design multi-level diffractive flat lenses with large apertures that could focus light across the visible spectrum and we have the resources in the Utah Nanofab to actually make them," study co-author Rajesh Menon, professor of electrical and computer engineering at University of Utah, said in the statement.

	Engineers are exploring propulsion methods that could enable longer-distance travel

Perhaps someday spacecraft will be able to take humans beyond the solar system.

GLENN HARVEY

By Aaron Tremper

7 hours ago

Pilots in Star Wars enter a dimension, hyperspace, to travel between distant worlds. To merge onto this cosmic highway, ships are equipped with special engines called hyperdrives. With the push of a lever, the spacecraft zooms faster than the speed of light, traversing between star systems in just hours or days. Han Solo and his sidekick Chewbacca make the jump to hyperspace look easy (at least when the Millennium Falcon is in working order).

But Star Wars breaks the laws of physics to achieve such a feat. Off-screen, the technology to reach another star system doesn't yet exist. However, emerging propulsion methods could brighten the future of interstellar travel.

Due to the nature of light and energy, it's impossible to reach the speed of light, nearly 300,000 kilometers per second. It would take an infinite amount of energy. The fastest any human-made object has traveled is only about 0.06 percent of that speed. At that rate, it would take about 6,600 years to reach the nearest exoplanet, Proxima Centauri b, 4.24 light-years away.

A spacecraft traveling at one-tenth of the speed of light could shave the trip down to a quick 40 years. Future engineers could use nuclear power to achieve that, says Scott Bailey, an engineer at Virginia Tech. But developing that technology could take thousands of years.

Controlled fusion could help, says Cole Miller, an astronomer at the University of Maryland in College Park. Controlled fusion harnesses energy from combining atomic nuclei to create a steady supply of power. Researchers have been working on controlled fusion for about 70 years. But so far, these experiments have yet to produce more energy than they consume.

Not all vehicles in the Star Wars universe rely on hyperdrives; some“sun jammers” have huge sails thatcatch stellar winds — the constantstream of charged particles producedby stars — to move throughspace like a ship on the sea.

Recently, the nonprofit Planetary Society tested a similar concept. The crowdfunded LightSail 2 launched in 2019 and orbited Earth for about three years. Rather than relying on solar wind, though, the small craft's solar sails used pressure from sunlight itself. Although light doesn't have mass, it does have momentum. The solar sails intercepted sunlight with thin sheets made of reflective Mylar and other polymers. When speeding photons hit the sail, they bounced.

Using solar sails to propel a large spacecraft would be tough, Miller says. The thrust produced probably wouldn't be strong enough to carry ships ferrying humans. Upscaling solar sails would offer unique benefits, however. Using sunlight would allow a spaceship to accelerate without fuel. And unlike objects on Earth, spacecraft aren't slowed by air friction produced by an atmosphere. This would allow any spacecraft to continue gaining speed as long as it's exposed to sunlight.

For now, spacefarers aren't looking to travel to another star system. But even travel within the solar system, say, to Mars, could use a boost. To safely bring people to and from the Red Planet, some researchers are looking to ion engines. These thrusters create force by shooting charged atoms from the back of a spacecraft. Star Wars' TIE Fighters, like the one flown by Darth Vader, navigate through space battles with them.

But real ion engines work best with straight paths, says Jarred Young, an engineer at the University of Maryland. “It's essentially point-and-click propulsion.”

Ion engines aren't as powerful as the chemical propellants in rockets, which create thrust by combusting fuel and oxygen-releasing substances called oxidizers. But chemical rockets burn for only a short time. Ion engines can last months or even years, possibly helping fuel trips to Mars, if engineers can design strong enough thrusters.

For now, reaching distant new worlds is only possible in fictional galaxies far, far away.

Name: Lake Salda

Location: Burdur province, southwestern Turkey

Coordinates: 37.54827653569846, 29.685860347540892

Why it's incredible: The lake is the only place on Earth that's similar to Jezero crater on Mars.

Lake Salda is a body of water in Turkey that bears a strong resemblance to Mars' Jezero crater. The stunning lake is the only place on Earth with geology and mineralogy comparable to those of the ancient impact structure on the Red Planet. This striking similarity meant scientists flocked to study its shores before the Perseverance rover landed on Mars in 2021.

Lake Salda is one of Turkey's deepest lakes, with a maximum depth of 643 feet (196 meters). Its shores are covered in powdered hydromagnesite, a carbonate mineral that's rich in magnesium and is found in caves and on the shores of certain lakes. Notably, this mineral holds clues about ancient microbial life.

"Carbonates are important because they are really good at trapping anything that existed within that environment, such as microbes, organics, or certain textures that provide evidence of past microbial life," Brad Garczynski, a researcher in planetary geology at Western Washington University, told NASA's Earth Observatory.

The hydromagnesite on Lake Salda's shores likely eroded from microbialites, which are rock-like mounds that look similar to coral reefs but are made of microbes. The lake still hosts intact microbialites, but these will eventually be reworked and end up as sand on the shoreline, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.

Using data from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, scientists detected similar minerals along Jezero's western edge in 2019, suggesting the crater once held a lake. These observations have since been confirmed by the Perseverance rover, which found mineral evidence of a lake that existed inside Jezero crater billions of years ago.

Lake Salda and Jezero crater have something else in common: depositional features known as deltas. Deltas are layers of sediment that accumulate in places where rivers flow into lakes and other bodies of water. The features offer tantalizing clues about how water came to fill Jezero, and studying them in Lake Salda has helped scientists narrow down their search to specific locations in the Martian crater.

"One of the great things about visiting Lake Salda is it really gives you a sense of what it would have been like to stand on the shores of ancient Lake Jezero," Horgan said.

The area around Lake Salda is home to more than 300 plant species and 30 waterfowl species, making it a popular destination for nature enthusiasts and hikers, according to CNN. The lake is only a short drive from the Pamukkale travertines — stunning limestone formations with thermal pools.

Incredibly rare footage has captured a mother snow leopard and her three cubs trudging through thick snow in the mountains of northern Pakistan.

Sakhawat Ali, a gamekeeper at the Central Karakoram National Park in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan, spotted the elusive animals on March 13 in a remote village called Hushe after two weeks of tracking their pugmarks [pawprints].

"Spotting four snow leopards is a great joy, as it indicates that the snow leopard population is increasing," Ali told Live Science.

Snow leopards (Panthera uncia) are an elusive species of big cat that can be found in mountainous areas across 12 countries in Central and Eastern Asia, and sightings are exceedingly rare. Their white coats render them almost invisible against the snowy mountains they call home, and more than 70% of their habitat remains unexplored, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).

Since late February, Ali said he had been noticing snow leopard pugmarks around the village. "While I was on the roof of my house, I used binoculars to observe the mountains and spotted a female snow leopard along with her four cubs," he said. "I quickly moved closer and filmed them from a distance of about 250 meters [820 feet]."

Snow leopards are usually solo travellers, so seeing four together is exceedingly rare.

"In the village [of Hushe] we are used to seeing snow leopards, but nobody, not even the elders that I spoke to, have ever seen four snow leopards in one go," Ali told CNN.

Female snow leopards typically have between one and five cubs with each litter, according to WWF. At three months old, the cubs begin to follow their mother out of their dens to learn how to hunt in their environment. However, they stay with their mothers until they are almost 2-years-old, according to San Diego Zoo.

The big cats are considered vulnerable to extinction, with only 4,000 to 6,000 individuals left worldwide, according to WWF estimates.

The Baltistan Wildlife Conservation and Development Organization (BWCDO), which shared Ali's video on Facebook, said the sighting was a positive sign of successful conservation efforts in the Hushe Valley area. However, the species still faces numerous threats.

According to the United Nations Environment Program, poaching, habitat fragmentation, prey depletion and climate change all threaten the snow leopard's existence.
