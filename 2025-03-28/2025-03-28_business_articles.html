Oops, something went wrong

Investors are betting on new Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan to turn around the troubled chipmaker.

While it's unclear whether Intel's financial problems can be fixed quickly, Wall Street analysts — and current and former employees — generally agree on what steps Tan needs to take, short of a breakup. Those steps include everything from cutting jobs to turbocharging Intel's young foundry business.

A semiconductor industry veteran, Tan was appointed to his new role on March 12. Investors applauded the news: Intel stock rose more than 15% the next day. Analysts liked Tan's experience as former CEO of Cadence Design Systems, a semiconductor design software company, and his experience on boards of some 14 semiconductor companies, including Intel.

Now the hard part.

Tan is inheriting a company whose financial losses have made it a takeover target in recent months. Many Wall Street analysts and investors believe Intel — which is the only American leading-edge chip manufacturer — would be better off splitting up and selling its struggling manufacturing business. Case in point: The stock has risen on various reports in recent months of potential deals, some of which were allegedly being worked on with the support of the Trump administration.

Reuters reported last week that Tan plans to keep Intel's manufacturing business running for now and is looking to bolster Intel's faltering AI chip efforts to catch up to Nvidia (NVDA). He said as much in a letter to employees on March 12: "Together, we will work hard to restore Intel's position as a world-class products company, establish ourselves as a world-class foundry and delight our customers like never before."

Read more about Intel's stock moves and today's market action.

Yahoo Finance interviewed four Wall Street analysts and ten current and former Intel employees — including high-level executives. The employees were granted anonymity due to nondisclosure agreements and fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities. Some of those sources said Intel should be left in one piece, at least for now. That's because, if split up, Intel's foundry would immediately go bankrupt, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon told Yahoo Finance.

And Intel's product business, which designs the chips, can't outsource to rival manufacturers so easily — Intel semiconductors are specifically made in accordance with its own internal manufacturing processes. Not to mention, Intel's billions in CHIPS Act funding requires it to retain majority ownership of its foundry.

Intel declined to make Lip-Bu Tan available for an interview but told Yahoo Finance: "Lip-Bu is spending a lot of time listening to customers and employees as he comes on board and works closely with our leadership team to position the business for future success."

Here's what company sources and Wall Street analysts said he has to do to to avoid a break up.

Intel is one of the few remaining chipmakers that both designs and makes its own chips.

On the design side, Intel has fallen behind rivals such as AMD (AMD) and, of course, Nvidia in an increasingly AI-dominated industry. On the manufacturing side, Intel has repeatedly faced delays.

Former CEO Pat Gelsinger attempted to grow Intel's revenue by opening its in-house manufacturing business — a "foundry" — to outside customers on a large scale. Foundries such as Taiwan's TSMC (TSM) produce chips for other companies. Intel historically produced chips for its internal product business before Gelsinger launched Intel Foundry Services (IFS) in 2021.

The foundry strategy had mixed results. Intel is set to achieve a big feat by launching a new advanced chip manufacturing process called 18A this year, and IFS has deals with Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). But analysts debate whether Intel can sustain the foundry, which lost $13.4 billion on $17.5 billion in revenue in 2024.

Bottom line: Intel needs to attract more big outside customers. Analysts and former executives said Tan's industry connections should help, but his credibility alone won't guarantee success.

In order for Intel's manufacturing business to survive, the company must succeed in launching 18A. While Intel manufacturing employees had previously suggested that the new technology was having trouble, those same employees said this week that 18A is progressing — and Intel manufacturing staff is feeling "positive" about its success.

As Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag said: "[I]f the results are good and companies are happy, they'll increase their capacity at" the foundry.

Per Reuters, Tan is looking to boost Intel's AI chip efforts to rival Nvidia and others.

Intel fumbled multiple attempts to enter what would become the AI chip market. In 2009, Intel scrapped a multiyear project, Larrabee, to develop a standalone GPU like Nvidia's. In 2017, Intel began a second effort toward a homegrown GPU, which did not ultimately result in a product competitive with Nvidia's. And in January Intel effectively killed its most recent effort, a high-end AI GPU called Falcon Shores.

Former Intel exec Raja Koduri, who led the 2017 GPU effort, suggested in an X post in February that the issue isn't Intel's products themselves but the company reluctance to bring them to market: "The tragedy of Intel's treasures lies in their delayed or deferred deployment," he wrote. "They [Intel] optimize for minimizing quarterly losses while missing the bigger picture."

"Intel still has a ton of IP and technology. These are gems that many in the eco-system envy. Many innovations have been sitting on shelf," he continued.

Another former high-level executive who was granted anonymity echoed Koduri's sentiment.

"Intel has a very good finance organization, but the company does sometimes make these decisions that are overly led by the early years' financial outcome," the person said. "You only learn from deploying. If you intend to be in that market long term, you might as well have access to the market, even if it costs you through the first generation."

Former and current Intel employees describe the company, whose staffers refer to themselves as "Team Blue," as slow and bureaucratic. Past high-level executives said the chipmaker's new CEO will need to shake up company culture and cut middle management.

It's a tough balancing act. The two current employees said any layoffs could depress morale and risk slowing the progress of 18A. Tan already has said Intel has "hard decisions" ahead. One of the employees said their colleagues are bracing for a potentially "huge amount” of layoffs in the second or third quarter.

They said their teams are already understaffed, and cuts to middle management would result in those teams being moved around, creating chaos.

One of the high-level former executives said, "The depth of talent at Intel is immense, and the loyalty that people have is astounding," later adding, "The answer lies in inspiring the people you have."

Oops, something went wrong

Gold futures (GC=F) rose to a fresh record on Friday as tariff threats sparked fears of an escalating trade war.

Futures surpassed $3,110 ahead of the Trump administration's reciprocal tariffs, expected to be announced next week as 25% levies are put on foreign autos. A weaker US dollar (DX-Y.NYB) has also supported higher gold prices.

The yellow metal is up more than 17% over the past quarter, on pace for its best year-to-date performance in nearly four decades.

Wall Street analysts have been upping their price target on gold in recent days.

Bank of America predicts the precious metal will reach $3,500 per ounce over the coming 18 months under the assumption that investments will increase 10% through more buying from China and central banks, along with investors purchasing physically backed ETFs.

In a note earlier this week, Goldman Sachs analysts said they expect gold to rise, "reflecting upside surprises in ETF inflows and in continued strong central bank gold demand." The firm has a year-end price target of $3,300 per troy ounce.

Gold inventories in New York skyrocketed this year as institutional investors shipped elevated amounts of physical bars to vaults in Manhattan. Gold inventories for the futures exchange Comex have spiked since November, reaching their highest level since the pandemic in 2021, according to Bloomberg data.

"What they [institutional investors] started doing in response is stockpiling. ... When you have conditions like that, and you throw in some safe-haven demands on top of it, you're going to see the price of gold start to creep up," Brett Elliott, director of marketing at American Precious Metals Exchange (APMEX), told Yahoo Finance earlier this month.

The same phenomenon has been happening with copper, which is up 30% year to date as elevated amounts of the metal have been shipped to the US amid fears that it will be hit with Trump's tariffs.

Earlier this week, copper (HG=F) futures accelerated to a new record in New York following a report that Trump is considering implementing levies on the commodity in a matter of weeks rather than months.

Futures on New York's Comex hovered around $5.13 per pound on Friday.

"Assuming tariffs are implemented in May, we think shipments to the US will likely be fast tracked," wrote Goldman Sachs' Eoin Dinsmore in a note to clients on Wednesday.

Demand from China is expected to keep prices high. Europe's moves to build up its defense infrastructure are also a tailwind for copper demand.

Meanwhile, silver was having its best week in three months as it hovered at a 13-year high.

Silver futures (SI=F) topped $35 per ounce, gaining 21% year to date.

Oops, something went wrong

The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed prices in February rose more than expected, re-intensifying the central bank's inflation battle at a time when it expects new tariffs from the Trump administration to push prices higher.

The new reading makes it more likely that officials hold rates at current levels for longer as policymakers look for signs of how President Trump's policies will affect the US economy in the months ahead.

"It looks like a 'wait-and-see' Fed still has more waiting to do," said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.

"Today's higher-than-expected inflation reading wasn't exceptionally hot, but it isn't going to speed up the Fed's timeline for cutting interest rates, especially given the uncertainty surrounding tariffs."

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that his "base case" is that any extra inflation from Trump's slate of tariffs will be "transitory." But some of his colleagues worry the effects could be more persistent, adding to the uncertainties ahead for the central bank.

The Fed's goal is to get inflation down to its 2% target, but the key measure released Friday remains well above that marker. The "core" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.8% year-over-year.

That reading was higher than economists' estimate of 2.7%, jumping from 2.6% in January. The month-over-month reading was also hotter, clocking in at 0.4%. That was higher than the 0.3% expected and up from that same level in the previous month.

Inflation now stands at the level the Fed predicted it would be at year's end — and that's before some of Trump's most aggressive tariff plans kick in. The president plans to announce a sweeping set of "reciprocal" country-by-country duties next week.

Fed officials raised their 2025 inflation forecast at a meeting last week, to 2.8% from 2.5% previously, due in large part to uncertainty surrounding the new tariffs. They also lowered their economic growth forecasts for the year.

But February's inflation report now shows that even the Fed's revised inflation forecast may prove to be too conservative.

Traders are still pricing in an interest rate cut in June with the potential for another cut in the fall. And the two-cut prediction from Wall Street still matches what Fed officials estimated at their meeting last week where they held rates unchanged.

Some Fed watchers, however, argue that these rate cut predictions could be challenged, too.

The new PCE reading "reinforces our view that the Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates this year," said Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist for Capital Economics.

The critical question ahead for Fed policymakers is how much of any additional inflation they expect to see is a one-off effect that will prove to be temporary.

While Powell has argued in favor of a potential "transitory" effect, some of his colleagues have offered more caution.

Boston Fed president Susan Collins said Thursday while speaking in Boston that she believes it's “inevitable that tariffs are going to increase inflation in the near term” and she expects the uptick in inflation could be short-lived.

But she added, “there are risks around that and depending on how that unfolds, it could be more persistent.”

Collins stressed that if there are additional rounds of tariffs, they are more broad-based, or if there are different levels of retaliation, then inflation could be more persistent than just a relatively fast adjustment to a higher level of prices.

In that context she said she would be looking more closely at inflation expectations because anchoring expectations is important for the Fed's credibility to bring inflation back down.

St. Louis Fed president Alberto Musalem also said this week that he could be "wary of assuming that the impact of tariff increases on inflation will be entirely temporary, or that a full 'look-through' strategy will necessarily be appropriate."

He noted that tariffs could create a one-time increase in price-levels, but that so-called "indirect effects" where domestic producers raise prices as importers raise prices could cause inflation to be more long lasting.

Musalem offered the example of beer from Canada. If it is subject to a 25% tariff, US consumers could shift from Canadian beer to American-made Budweiser, and then Budweiser could increase its prices as people look for locally produced goods.

"Distinguishing, especially in real-time, between direct, indirect, and second-round effects entails considerable uncertainty," he added.

Oops, something went wrong

Car buyers should be ready for sticker shock when kicking the tires on a new ride in 2025, thanks to new tariffs from the Trump administration.

"A 25% tariff on imported cars could raise the price by $5K to $15K (assuming car values of $20K to $60K that are subject to tariffs for illustrative purposes, although we acknowledge some vehicles could fall outside this band)," Goldman Sachs autos analyst Mark Delaney warned on Friday.

Trump said Wednesday the US will impose 25% tariffs on imports of cars and car parts, to take effect on April 3. The measures will apply to both finished cars and trucks.

“This will continue to spur growth that you've never seen before," Trump said from the White House about the new tariffs.

According to estimates from Cox Automotive, the tariffs would directly impact half of the 50 bestselling models in the US.

Investors and Wall Street don't appear to agree with Trump, given the response in markets.

The tariffs could increase production costs for automakers and dampen demand by raising prices for consumers. About half of all vehicles sold in the US are imported.

Shares of the Big Three US automakers, which build vehicles abroad, hit the skids on Thursday. General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) fell 7.4% and 3.9%, respectively, while Europe-focused Stellantis (STLA) dropped 2%.

Shares of all three continued to be under pressure in premarket trading on Friday.

The tariffs announcement caused JPMorgan (JPM) to slash ratings and estimates on the auto sector, citing "material" earnings risk.

One luxury carmaker noted it won't be immune either.

In a statement, Ferrari (RACE) said that it may raise prices by up to 10% to reflect the higher tariffs. Ferrari reaffirmed its financial outlook for 2025 but noted the risk that EBIT and EBITDA margins could face a 50 basis point reduction.

Goldman's Delaney said even locally made automobiles may see sharp sticker price increases, reflecting the higher cost of parts.

"Moreover, assuming about 50% of parts content in US made cars is foreign (per the White House fact sheet), a 25% tariff could raise the cost of locally made vehicles by roughly $3K-$8K prior to any offsets (assuming costs of $20K to $60K for a typical vehicle for illustrative purposes, although some vehicles would fall outside of this band), although we'd note that tariffs, at least for now, would only apply to certain auto parts and thus the actual tariff costs on auto parts may be somewhat lower than this," Delaney explained.

"Moreover, assuming about 50% of parts content in US made cars is foreign (per the White House fact sheet), a 25% tariff could raise the cost of locally made vehicles by roughly $3K-$8K prior to any offsets (assuming costs of $20K to $60K for a typical vehicle for illustrative purposes, although some vehicles would fall outside of this band), although we'd note that tariffs, at least for now, would only apply to certain auto parts and thus the actual tariff costs on auto parts may be somewhat lower than this," Delaney explained.

Oops, something went wrong

While Wall Street frets about potential volatility from President Trump's April 2 "Liberation Day" plans, another part of America is also bracing for more possible chaos: US ports.

If the president next week imposes sweeping new duties on America's top trading partners, that could place a significant new burden on ports of entry from coast to coast, which act as conduits for a wide variety of goods critical to the global economy.

One person trying to raise the alarm with policymakers this week is Cindy Allen, CEO of an international trade consulting company called Trade Force Multiplier.

There comes a point, she told Yahoo Finance in between meetings, when "you're stacking all of the duty rates together" to such an extent that "the custom system can't handle that."

At issue is what is known as the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States — also known as the tariff book. It's a 99-chapter-long guide with somewhere around 18,000 different numbers that serves as the go-to guide for duty collectors and importers about what tariffs to apply to what products.

Trump has already added multitudes to this complicated arrangement with actions that so far include new 20% tariffs on China, 25% tariffs on many imports from Canada and Mexico, and 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports since taking office.

But his reciprocal tariff plans could take things to another level and apply to a wider array of goods and trading partners. As the president told reporters this week, "friend has often been much worse than foe" and that next week's actions will apply to both.

A White House official added to Yahoo Finance that the administration has been listening to the business world feedback and "a lot of that has been taken into consideration." The White House official expected the still-being finalized plans for next week to focus on country-by-country tariffs with the overall view being "the status quo, as we see it, cannot stand."

As Trump's reciprocal tariff plans began to take shape, the administration first signaled that reciprocal tariffs could be a sort of mirror on US trading partners, where the US would calibrate its actions to reflect the duties other countries currently have in place.

This week, Allen called that the "absolute nightmare scenario" in her view because of the complexity it would add.

More recently, the Trump administration has said that a somewhat more straightforward plan is now likely in part to reflect so-called non-tariff barriers that other countries impose such as value-added and digital taxes. That expected rollout would mean — as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently put it — "each country will receive a number that we believe ... represents their tariffs."

But even that will likely add a new and complex layer to the tariff book.

"That can also be really complicated," said Greta Peisch, who served as general counsel for the US Trade Representative's (USTR) office during the Biden administration.

Peisch noted this week that a plan where a range of countries have different duties means that even goods that in the past could largely move quickly across the border must now be more closely scrutinized to determine their country of origin.

"When you have different tariffs on products from different countries that vary widely, that just increases the logistical and compliance complexity," she added.

As Allen put it, perhaps more bluntly, about these two scenarios: "They're both nightmares."

That's because for importers, even in the latter scenario, many goods will be subject to a greater array of levies.

One example might be an aluminum baseball bat from Canada that could soon be subject to at least three new Trump 2.0 duties — one specific to the aluminum, one imposed on Canada over illegal drugs and migration, and then these incoming reciprocal tariffs.

Imports from China are even more complex, with some imports facing a network of overlapping duties that, in some cases, are already near 100% tariff levels — even before Trump's additional reciprocal actions next week that are expected to include China.

Trump's country-by-country tariff plans could be even further complicated by new sector duties that could also come into force at the same time.

On Wednesday, Trump announced that new 25% tariffs on foreign-made automobiles and "certain auto parts" will begin coming into effect on April 2, with the first duties on cars felt on April 3.

As will a new plan for secondary tariffs on any country that buys oil from Venezuela. That also comes into force on April 2, when Trump will be able to levy new duties.

"Many processes today are automated, although far fewer than one might think. There's still a lot of paper involved in customs," noted Mary Lovely, a trade expert and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute, in a recent episode of Yahoo Finance's Capitol Gains podcast.

She added that Trump's auto tariff announced this week could add yet another layer as the Trump administration is promising to look for American content in the auto parts supply chain and exempt them from tariffs.

"That's definitely something we're not doing," Lovely added, saying, "It's going to cause an enormous headache for companies and then for customs."

The president also has issued a range of other sector-specific threats — from pharmaceuticals to semiconductors to lumber to dairy — with many likely to be formally unveiled in the coming days and in force soon thereafter.

Trump's plans have been the subject of intense lobbying in recent weeks. Some CEOs, like Ford's (F) Jim Farley, have gotten the president on the phone to express their worries. Trump's economic team has also been speaking to CEOs. Others have gone through the more formal process.

"There's been a lot of businesses that have been successful in meeting with USTR and with the different levels in the administration to communicate," Allen noted.

"They want to comply regardless of where they fall on the political spectrum, but they need the ability to do that," she added, noting that much of the challenge is in planning for tariffs when details are not yet announced but could be in place within days.

Overall, as Peisch noted of the worries, "I don't know that that will dissuade them from going down this path, which they have made a big part of the president's agenda during those first couple months."
