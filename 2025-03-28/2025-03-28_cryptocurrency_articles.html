                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Haliey Welch, also known as Hawk Tuah, has stated that she is no longer worried about the Securities and Exchange Commission's probe into her meme coin.

The agency dropped the investigation without making any findings against or seeking any monetary sanctions.


Welch launched a meme coin called HAWK on Solana in December, which quickly imploded and sparked backlash.


The Tennessee native's meme coin reached a market cap of $490 million before collapsing 93% in value within minutes.


A civil lawsuit is still ongoing against the creators of HAWK, including its launchpad OverHERE and its founder Clinton So.


Welch was cooperating with authorities and attorneys regarding the probe.


Welch told TMZ that she has completed her cooperation with all authorities and attorneys.


The SEC does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.


Meme coins are cryptocurrencies that trade on marketing and hype, and Welch's HAWK is among several names that dropped one last year.

Welch indicated in a now-deleted interview that she regrets how her crypto endeavors played out.


She stated that her knowledge of crypto was surface-level, and she didn't really know what she was getting into.

The price of HAWK jumped on Friday by 25% on the decentralized exchange Meteora.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The successor to the Nintendo Switch will have enhanced hardware and features, but it is not clear what these changes are.

The console will be able to play original Switch software, as confirmed by Nintendo in a tweet on November 5, 2024. This was previously rumored and reported. The Switch Online service will also return on Switch 2.

Nintendo repeated the message in the January 2025 trailer, showing that Switch cartridges will fit into the Switch 2, and noting that digital games will also be supported. A physical copy of Super Mario Bros. Wonder was shown in the trailer.

The console's hardware is not fully disclosed yet, but it will have a generational leap forward from the original Switch. It will have enhanced power compared to the original Switch, which may enable developers to create more complex and detailed games.

EA appears to be onboard with the Switch 2, and Andrew Wilson, CEO of EA, stated that any time a new console comes into the marketplace is a benefit for them, allowing access to new players.

Microsoft is also planning to support the Switch 2 with Xbox games, as part of their expansion to bring their owned franchises to other hardware. Phil Spencer, Xbox boss, said he's "really looking forward to supporting" Nintendo's next console with games.

Rockstar Games' official reveal of Grand Theft Auto 6 has raised questions about whether it will come to the Switch 2, and if the console is powerful enough to handle the game.

Digital Foundry founder Richard Leadbetter expressed doubts that the Switch 2 will be able to handle Rockstar's next big game.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A New Jersey regulator has ordered Kalshi and Robinhood to stop offering prediction markets based on sporting events to New Jersey locals.

In a cease-and-desist-order dated Thursday, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement alleged the trading platforms have illegally offered sports wagering services in The Garden State.

Robinhood and Kalshi must comply with the order by the end of March 28 or face enforcement actions, according to the letter.

The state regulator added that the trading platforms’ actions violate the New Jersey Sports Wagering Act, which “only permits licensed entities to offer sports wagering to patrons located in New Jersey.”

Nearly two weeks ago, Robinhood launched its March Madness prediction markets powered by Kalshi to capitalize on traders’ growing appetites for sports betting.

Legal sports wagers exceeded $140 billion in 2024, up roughly 23% from the year prior, CBS Sports reported.

Earlier this month, Kalshi received orders from regulators in Nevada to stop offering derivatives trading on professional and college athletics events in the state.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The New York Attorney General and Galaxy Digital have agreed to a settlement over the crypto firm’s handling of the collapsed Terra LUNA cryptocurrency.

Galaxy will pay $200 million for alleged violations of the Martin Act and New York Executive Law.

A 49-page filing from the Office of the Attorney General of New York (OAG) outlines the investigation and the Office’s conclusions.

The OAG alleges that Galaxy's conduct, including its misrepresentations and omissions about LUNA while selling it, constituted violations of the above laws.

Galaxy CEO Michael Novogratz said in a statement that settling this matter will help his firm move forward and minimize distractions.

Galaxy initially purchased more than 18.5 million LUNA tokens for $0.22 per token as part of an agreement with Terraform Labs.

The OAG's findings indicate that a Galaxy memo proposed making the public more aware of the Terra ecosystem as part of the trade.

Novogratz promoted Terraform Labs' LUNA token through posts on X, podcast interviews, and even via a tattoo he promised to get if LUNA reached $100.

Galaxy sold millions of tokens into the market without disclosing that it was selling while Novogratz urged his social media followers to "keep the faith" as LUNA fell from its $100 mark.

Markets always consolidate after huge moves, Novogratz said on social media in January 2022, but he later sold more LUNA tokens throughout January and February.

By February 28, 2022, Galaxy was left with only 2,060 LUNA tokens.

Galaxy Digital Research noted a known risk in the LUNA token that could result in a "death spiral" for the first time in March 2022.

Two months later, Terraform Labs' algorithmic TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin lost its 1:1 peg to the U.S. Dollar and the LUNA token collapsed alongside.

Galaxy did not admit to or deny the findings as part of the Assurance of Discontinuation filing.

As part of the agreement, Galaxy must create and maintain policies and procedures regarding public statements on cryptocurrencies that it may have interest in.</p>

There was a lot of excitement for GameStop's Q4 earnings report because it was heavily hinted—and then confirmed—that the company was going to start buying Bitcoin.

The video game retailer, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the GME ticker, reported $4.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of February 1—up from $921 million the same time last year.

But instead of using a portion of that cash to buy Bitcoin, it's raising $1.3 billion in a convertible note offering.

GME investors are not pleased, but traders are finding a way to profit on the news: Short volume yesterday was the highest it's been since meme stock influencer Roaring Kitty made his return last summer.

Meanwhile, GME has erased its BTC bump and sank near a six-month low. By Friday afternoon, the price of GME was hovering around $22 and had lost 12.9% over the past five days.

Investors have noted on X, formerly Twitter, that more than 71% of GME volume is being traded off exchanges in dark pools.

**The Incredible, Shrinking Bitcoin Fees**

Troubling news for miners: Bitcoin transaction fees have been shrinking.

BlocksBridge Consulting noted in its newsletter this week that transaction fees now make up only 1.25% of total block rewards.

That's the lowest it's been since April 2022.

"Without a significant uptick in Bitcoin's market price or a revival in transaction fees, these miners may soon face an unmanageable situation: they may no longer be able to compete," BlockBridge analysts wrote.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market are in the throes of a rout.</p>

Three co-founders of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX—Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed—were pardoned by President Trump on Friday.

They had pled guilty in 2022 to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act for failing to operate an anti-money laundering program at the cryptocurrency exchange.

Each founder also agreed to pay a $10 million fine to settle the charges.

In January, Manhattan federal judge Judge John G. Koeltl ordered the exchange to pay $100 million to settle violations that took place between 2015 and 2020.

The exchange said it was happy with the outcome.

Regulators initially alleged that BitMEX had allowed U.S. clients to use its exchange without verifying their identities.

In 2021, BitMEX paid $100 million in civil penalties after FinCEN alleged that the exchange's senior leadership "altered U.S. customer information to hide the customer's true location."

President Trump campaigned with a pro-business agenda and spoke frequently about the tech and crypto spheres.

A number of top crypto companies have had charges against them or investigations dropped since the new commander in chief took office.</p>

Crypto exchange Coincall has officially entered the Top 5 global crypto options exchanges by trading volume.

The achievement highlights the platform's rapid growth in a sector that's increasingly drawing both institutional and retail interest.

According to internal data and third-party analytics, the surge in performance is linked to a successful Q1 strategy.

This included high-impact marketing campaigns and new product rollouts, in collaboration with notable crypto partners such as SignalPlus, DWF, and Big Candle Capital.

Crypto Options: From Niche Strategy to Core Market Structure

Once reserved for quants and hedge funds, options are now becoming a go-to instrument for crypto-native investors.

These contracts give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell assets at a set price — enabling sophisticated hedging, volatility plays, and directional speculation.

As the broader digital asset market matures, crypto options are increasingly viewed as a critical building block of the financial stack.

Youngest in the Top 5 — and Fastest Rising

Coincall's breakout is notable not just for its velocity, but for the company's relative youth.

Founded in late 2023, Coincall now ranks among the top exchanges in the space, with it currently 9-10% the size of Deribit.

According to data from Laevitas, Coincall captured an average market share of 5.43% between March 8 and 17, 2025.

Leadership Backed by Vision

In January, Coincall appointed Daryl Teo — former strategist at Alibaba Group (NASDAQ: BABA) and a long-time investor in the crypto space — as Chief Operating Officer and minority shareholder.

He joins CEO Jimmy's team of executives previously from OKX, Paradigm and Bytedance.

Leadership Backed by Vision

"We're witnessing crypto achieve consensus-level legitimacy as a store of value," Teo said. 

"Options are the next wave — they provide leverage, flexibility, and strategy."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scaling alone won’t define the next generation of blockchain—it’s what comes after that will set projects apart. Sui and Polkadot have each focused on core improvements: throughput, interoperability, and developer ecosystems.

Sui introduced parallel transaction processing, while Polkadot redefined how chains can work together. Yet, BlockDAG is shifting the conversation. While it offers high performance and scalability, its roadmap extends into AI integration, decentralized governance, and self-sovereign identity—components critical to long-term relevance.

As presale interest swells and technical milestones are hit, BlockDAG is positioning itself not just as a high-performance Layer 1 but as a future-ready infrastructure for Web3 and beyond. Sui was launched in May 2023 by former Meta engineers, emphasizing scalability and speed.

Its unique object-based model allows parallel transaction processing, enabling the network to handle over 4.58 billion transactions across 18.19 million active accounts as of January 2025. As a result, this design has attracted a diverse range of decentralized applications (dApps), expanding its ecosystem to 54 protocols by early 2025.

Furthermore, Sui’s DeFi sector has particularly flourished, with its Perpetual DEX recording a trading volume of $5.57 billion in January 2025, surpassing major competitors. Consequently, the SUI token has mirrored this growth, experiencing an 11.60% price increase over the past week.

Polkadot was conceptualized by Dr. Gavin Wood and launched its mainnet in May 2020, aiming to facilitate interoperability among diverse blockchains. Specifically, by enabling multiple parachains to operate concurrently, Polkadot enhances scalability and fosters a collaborative ecosystem.

As of now, over 50 parachains are active, reflecting robust adoption. In addition, the DOT token plays a central role in governance, staking, and bonding within the network. Over 55% of DOT’s circulating supply is currently staked, indicating strong community engagement.

BlockDAG isn’t limiting itself to transactional speed or decentralization—it’s setting the stage for a broader technological convergence. By contrast, by 2026, the team aims to go far beyond infrastructure, integrating artificial intelligence, decentralized governance, and self-sovereign identity systems into its ecosystem.

To elaborate, the vision includes decentralized AI protocols that operate transparently and securely on-chain, enabling intelligent automation without centralized control. Simultaneously, self-sovereign identity tools will let users own and manage their digital identities independently—key to unlocking secure DeFi, voting, healthcare, and more.

Importantly, governance won’t be a bolt-on feature; BlockDAG is building mechanisms for token holders to influence protocol evolution directly. Backing this vision, the project has raised $208 million through its presale alone, without venture capital.

It’s now in batch 27 of its presale phase, with the current price per BDAG token at $0.0248. Since its inception, early backers have seen a return of 2,380%, with over 18.9 billion coins sold to date.

As CTO Jeremy Harkness affirmed during Keynote 3, “We’re exploring new frontiers like AI, self-sovereign identity, data personhood, and decentralized governance.” BlockDAG’s roadmap doesn’t stop at mainnet—it aims to redefine what a Layer 1 network can be in a future where decentralization intersects with intelligence and autonomy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are in the red Friday, with top coins falling to their lowest prices in at least a week as stock markets are similarly rattled by hotter-than-expected inflation data.

The price of Bitcoin dipped to $83,609 early Friday afternoon, and is currently down about 4% on the day at a current price of $83,736.


Other top coins have shown sharper losses over the past day, however, with Ethereum down 6% to $1,875 and XRP falling about 7% to $2.17.

Both fell to weekly lows on Friday alongside Bitcoin.


Amid the declines, crypto liquidations have surged over the past day, tallying more than $450 million as of this writing per data from CoinGlass.

Long positions make up the bulk of the carnage at $402 million, and Ethereum is the biggest contributor to liquidations with $136 million worth in total.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A high-ranking official in Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration declared Tuesday that a potential strategic Bitcoin reserve would be "determinant for our prosperity" and "in the (country’s) public interest."

Pedro Giocondo Guerra, chief of staff to Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, made the remarks while officially representing the federal government at a congressional ceremony.

Debating the establishment of a sovereign bitcoin reserve rigorously is a matter of public interest and will be crucial for our prosperity,” Guerra said. “Bitcoin is digital gold—the gold of the internet. It is a technology that allows wealth to be transferred across the globe swiftly and enables us to store the fruits of our labor efficiently and securely.”

The statement underscored the country’s heightened interest in Bitcoin amid a growing list of countries that have made it part of their political strategies.

Guerra’s comments came shortly after deputy Eros Biondini (PL-MG) introduced legislation proposing the creation of a "Strategic Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve" (RESBit). That bill would mandate the government acquire Bitcoin up to 5% of Brazil's international reserves, with the Brazilian Central Bank handling custody using advanced monitoring systems and blockchain technology and AI to monitor transactions.

Brazil's existing crypto landscape is already robust. The country started approving spot cryptocurrency ETFs before any other nation in the Americas and offers diverse investment vehicles.

The proposed legislation outlines multiple objectives for the Bitcoin reserve. These include diversifying the National Treasury's financial assets, protecting international reserves against currency fluctuations and geopolitical risks, promoting blockchain technology adoption across public and private sectors, and providing backing for Brazil's controversial CBDC, the DREX.

If approved, the bill would require the government to implement the reserve gradually while adhering to fiscal responsibility laws and ensuring public account stability. The legislation also mandates transparent management with biannual reports to Congress.

The bill must still navigate the full legislative process, requiring approval from various committees, passage in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, and finally presidential approval or veto.

According to Biondini's proposal, the Bitcoin reserve would position Brazil "at the forefront of the digital economy" and increase the country’s economic resilience by reducing exposure to currency fluctuations and geopolitical risks.

The bill references Brazil’s high adoption rate of cryptocurrencies, noting that in 2022, approximately 16% of the Brazilian population reported having used or owned crypto assets according to research by Finder.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Avraham “Avi” Eisenberg and his lawyers are seeking leniency in a recently filed sentencing memorandum related to his child pornography and cryptocurrency market manipulation charges.

Eisenberg famously manipulated the Mango Markets DAO by entering into a series of transactions that allowed him to appropriate large quantities of assets.

After the Federal Bureau of Investigations received a search warrant for Eisenberg’s phone, they identified child pornography on the device.

The sentencing memorandum notes that Eisenberg states that he will not “break any more laws.”

Additionally, it notes that his cryptocurrency-related sentencing should be modified downward because:

“He researched the legality of the MNGO trade and found ample reason to draw the conclusion (which was rejected by the jury’s verdict) that the trade was not illegal.”

“He acted in an environment where the practice of actively identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities… is commonplace and financially rewarded.”

“He intended to, and did, repay a substantial amount of the money he obtained well before he was charged.”

Furthermore, regarding his child pornography charges, he claimed that he “initially considered all depictions of sexual activity so extremely sinful that he made no distinction between child pornography and adult pornography.”

Eisenberg’s letter to the judge further notes that he “believed that smart contracts were, in general, valid legal contracts.” Furthermore, he claims that he “did not want to cause users to lose funds.”

The conclusion of Eisenberg’s letter notes that once released, he hopes “to use my talents and knowledge for good,” possibly by continuing “with trading and investments (while making sure to comply with all applicable laws).”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gunzilla Games, the studio behind crypto battle royale shooter Off the Grid, announced Tuesday that it had acquired the long-running Game Informer print magazine and online publication.

The entire team is returning to work on the magazine, which ran for 33 years before being shut down by its previous owner GameStop last August.


In an interview with Decrypt, Gunzilla Games Director of Web3 Theodore Agranat called this move “very crucial” to the studio’s long-term plans. He explained that it makes sense for GUNZ and Gunzilla Games to have "long-term alignment" with an iconic gaming magazine.

Agranat referred to its dedicated Avalanche L1 network, saying "We firmly believe that in the future, there [will be] no Web2 and Web3 gaming differences. It's just gaming."

The reboot of Game Informer was met with a wave of delight from some fans, along with a healthy chunk of concern from Web3-skeptic gamers.

According to statements made by both Gunzilla and Game Informer, the magazine will operate as an independent entity.


"We don't have an intention to alter our editorial coverage toward a specific area of focus," Game Informer Editor-in-Chief Matt Miller told Decrypt. "We have always covered all kinds of games that we think might be interesting to our readers, and we have covered games that feature some crypto or NFT elements in the past; we continue to be open to that in the future."

Gunzilla Games said it would be happy to provide Game Informer special access to its ecosystem that other publications wouldn’t have access to.

On top of this, Agranat said that if Game Informer wants to embrace blockchain, GUNZ and Gunzilla’s wider crypto tech stack will be available for the magazine to use at any time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) said he doesn't believe stablecoin issuers like Tether should have to comply with the anti-money laundering Bank Secrecy Act.

The lawmaker believes stablecoin issuers, regardless of jurisdiction, should not be subject to the stringent anti-money laundering rules under the Bank Secrecy Act.

Emmer stated that the protections provided by the Bank Secrecy Act were drafted for cash and don't account for blockchain technology.

Stablecoins are digital assets typically pegged to the U.S. dollar and designed to keep a steady price, used by cryptocurrency traders to enter and exit positions without the need for dollars.

The latest drafts of the GENIUS Act and STABLE Act treat all stablecoin issuers as financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act.

The law established a set of proactive anti-money laundering rules that American banks must comply with in order to operate, including suspicious activity monitoring and routine audits.

Foreign stablecoin issuers like Tether would pose quite a hurdle for existing foreign stablecoin issuers if they had to comply with such requirements.

Tether enjoys much less strict regulation than the Bank Secrecy Act would mandate, but the company's leadership has implied that moves to force all stablecoin issuers to comply with such rules would hurt the firm and aid its competitors.

Circle, the issuer behind the market's second-largest stablecoin USDC, is already based in the United States and regulated as a money transmitter by the New York Department of Financial Services.

Emmer does not want to risk locking Tether, or any other foreign issuer, out of the burgeoning U.S. stablecoin sector.

"We've got to let everybody compete in this space," he said.

To Emmer, the sticking point is proof of reserves – showing the government that your token is backed up with sufficient collateral to keep its value pegged to the dollar even in periods of market volatility.

Emmer believes Tether is doing well in terms of providing proof of reserves and has partnered with Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald to help custody some of the $92 billion worth of U.S. Treasuries it claims to currently hold in reserve.

The House Financial Services Committee is set to mark up the STABLE Act during a session next week.

Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act already passed out of the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month with strong bipartisan support – Bank Secrecy language intact.

It is likely to face a full vote on the Senate floor in the coming months.</p>

The 19b-4 form for Grayscale's AVAX ETF follows its registration as a Delaware Trust entity more than two weeks ago.

If approved, the AVAX ETF would use Coinbase Custody as its custodian, the 19b-4 shows.

AVAX, the utility token of Layer-1 blockchain Avalanche, was recently trading at $20.17, down 8% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows.

This latest sign that Grayscale could soon file for a spot AVAX ETF comes less than three weeks after investment firm VanEck also registered for an Avalanche (AVAX) ETF in Delaware.

Several asset managers already offer Avalanche ETPs, which provide direct access to the AVAX through regulated exchanges.

The application forms part of a broader trend of fund issuers jockeying to introduce altcoin ETFs as federal regulators take a softer stance on crypto-based investment products under newly elected President Donald Trump.

Grayscale already offers spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to its clients. It has also applied to launch funds based on less traded cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin. 

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a conversion from an existing trust, manages nearly $17 billion in assets, the third most among Bitcoin funds behind similar products from BlackRock and Fidelity.

The Grayscale Ethereum Trust controls about $2.5 billion in assets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yesterday, Rep. Jordan Pace reintroduced Bill H. 4256, The “Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Act Of South Carolina”, into South Carolina’s House of Representatives.

Highlights from the bill include the fact that it enables the State Treasurer to invest up to 10% of the funds under the state’s management into digital assets, including bitcoin, and that the state’s Strategic Digital Assets Reserve can include up to one million bitcoin.

The bill also states that the reason for establishing such a reserve is because “inflation has eroded the purchasing power of assets held in state funds” and that “bitcoin, a decentralized digital asset, and other digital assets offer unique properties that can act as a hedge against inflation and economic volatility.”

The bill does not stipulate whether or not state officials should hold the private keys to the bitcoin and other digital assets that it accumulates for the reserve, though it enables the State Treasurer to develop policies and protocols to protect the assets held in the reserve, including the use of cold storage or the contracting of a third party to maintain custody of the assets. The State Treasurer can also utilize a third party to assist in the creation, maintenance, and administration of the reserve’s security.

As per the bill, the State Treasurer would be responsible for preparing a biennial report that includes the total amount of digital assets held in the reserve, the U.S. dollar value of those assets, and transactions and expenditures related to the reserve since the previous report. Also, the State Treasurer would be required to publish proof of reserves, which includes the public addresses of the digital assets held in the reserve on an official state website, enabling citizens to independently audit and verify the reserve’s holdings.

Finally, the bill stipulates that the Strategic Digital Asset Reserve undergo audits that include an examination of the quality of the security of custody solutions; an assessment of compliance with local, state and federal laws; and an evaluation of internal controls to mitigate against cyberattacks and mismanagement.

According to the bill, the independent audits should be conducted annually and submitted to the relevant oversight committee. Any recommendations resulting from the independent audits must be addressed within 90 days of the issuance of the report, and a follow-up reporting detailing the corrective actions taken must also be provided to the oversight committee.</p>

$NATO was born out of a growing concern with the direction of many modern cryptocurrencies — specifically, the increasing trend toward centralization.

The Nation Token ($NATO), a decentralized token on the Base blockchain, has announced its official launch following a historic airdrop to one million active Base wallets.

In December 2024, 74% of the total 1 trillion $NATO supply — 740 billion tokens — was airdropped evenly to 1 million randomly selected Base wallets, with each wallet receiving 740,000 $NATO. This marks one of the largest and most distributed token airdrops in blockchain history.

Uniswap liquidity has been locked until January 1, 2030, reinforcing the commitment to long-term decentralization.

The Nation Token aims to break the pattern of centralized cryptocurrencies by creating a truly community-owned and community-governed asset, where every decision and milestone is driven by the people, aligning with its mantra of #PowerToThePeople.

A governance platform is currently in final development to enable token holders to vote on proposals and roadmap decisions — completing one of the final pillars of $NATO’s decentralization framework.

A governance platform is currently in final development to enable token holders to vote on proposals and roadmap decisions — completing one of the final pillars of $NATO’s decentralization framework.

The Nation Token saw growth in trading activity following its initial Uniswap listing (paired with WETH), with a 10x increase in trading volume according to the team after listings on both Poloniex and AscendEX.

Additional exchange listings are already in the pipeline, with further awareness and participation driven by a community growth campaign at https://taskon.xyz/TheNationToken.</p>

Ethereum gaming metaverse platform The Sandbox will launch its Alpha Season 5 on Monday, March 31, bringing a number of new game experiences tied to major franchises.

The six-week gaming event will introduce over 40 new games from an array of brands and franchises, including Jurassic World, Teletubbies, Atari, Attack on Titan, Terminator: Dark Fate, and Hellboy.

As Decrypt previously reported, the season's flagship experience, Jurassic World: Dinosaur Preserve, invites players to manage a dinosaur sanctuary, offering a blend of conservation simulation and adventure inspired by the film franchise.

"Alpha Season 5 marks the beginning of a new era for The Sandbox as we take a major step in growing into a more mature, always-on, live services model," said The Sandbox COO Sebastien Borget, in a statement. "Players can expect to enjoy a huge variety of new and updated games from their favorite brands and franchises."

The platform will distribute up to $1 million in SAND token rewards through a free seasonal battle pass, allowing players to unlock exclusive digital equipment. The season also includes the limited-edition Jurassic World Dinosaur Egg event, where players can hatch and grow rare species like Triceratops and Velociraptors.

As previously announced, the Alpha Season 5 launch also brings technological enhancements with Game Maker 0.11, letting builders further customize their games with more realistic avatar animations and expanded mobility features, including flying and double jumping.</p>

Oasys, a leading blockchain platform backed by prominent Japanese conglomerates such as SBI Group, today announced a strategic partnership with Animechain.ai.

The collaboration aims to expand anime culture by streamlining anime production processes and developing infrastructure to create new anime business opportunities.

Securing Creative Industries Through Blockchain

The partnership brings together Oasys's expertise in blockchain security with Animechain.ai's specialized knowledge in AI and creative industries.

Ryo Matsubara, Director of Oasys Pte. Ltd., highlighted the significance of blockchain in addressing the challenges posed by AI:

“At Oasys, we recognize the transformative power of AI but also the challenges it poses for intellectual property rights.

This collaboration leverages Japan's influential position in global creative industries to develop solutions with worldwide applications.

Setting New Standards for Ethical AI in Creative Production

The partnership emphasizes ethical and sustainable creative production, introducing responsible approaches to AI and blockchain integration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has issued new guidance allowing banks it supervises to engage in bitcoin and crypto activities without seeking pre-approval.

This reverses a controversial policy imposed under the Biden administration.

In a March 28 statement, the FDIC said banks can now participate in crypto-related services like custody and trading if they properly manage the risks. 

The agency will also work to replace old regulations with updated crypto guidance.


The policy change came in a new Financial Institution Letter that rescinds earlier rules from 2022 requiring banks to get FDIC clearance before handling bitcoin and crypto assets.

That red tape frustrated the banking industry.

By removing this barrier, the FDIC enables its supervised banks to experiment with this emerging ecosystem more freely.

However, specific permissions will still depend on interagency coordination.

Acting FDIC Chairman Travis Hill called the move “one of several steps” in laying out a new crypto-friendly approach focused on security.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Justin Sun, Global Advisor of HTX and Founder of TRON, has been featured on the daily cover of Forbes digital assets.

Sun becomes the second Chinese entrepreneur, after Jack Ma, and the fourth crypto exchange figure, following CZ, SBF, and Brian Armstrong, to achieve this prestigious recognition. 

The Forbes feature portrays Sun as a figure of "youth, controversy, and immense wealth." Born in 1990, Sun has built a reputation for bold, unconventional moves within the blockchain space.

Sun's flagship project, TRON, ranks among the fastest-growing blockchain networks in the world, with over 300 million users and daily transaction volumes exceeding ten million. This achievement underscores his vision for a "global payment system" and reflects the increasing mainstream adoption of blockchain technologies.

As Global Advisor of HTX, Sun has helped steer the exchange to new heights. HTX was recently recognized by Forbes as one of the “Top 25 World’s Most Trustworthy Crypto Exchanges of 2025”. 

Under Sun’s leadership, HTX has championed compliance, security, and user experience, setting a benchmark for the convergence of traditional finance and crypto innovation.

Sun joins a short list of visionary leaders from the crypto exchange world, alongside CZ, SBF, and Brian Armstrong, who have earned this recognition. He was previously included in Forbes Portugal’s “40 Notable Blockchain Entrepreneurs to Watch” list, where he ranked second—only behind Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.

In late 2024, Justin was appointed as Prime Minister of the Republic of Liberland, aiming to redefine the crypto space with principles of freedom and innovation. 

The Forbes article also highlights Sun’s collaboration with the Trump family, a partnership that reportedly generated over $400 million. His $75 million investment in the Trumps’ World Liberty Financial (WLFI) project demonstrates how crypto can be strategically deployed to integrate with mainstream business initiatives.

Sun emphasizes the importance of a “long-term vision” in his Forbes interview. Both HTX and TRON now prioritize transparency, open-source development, and community governance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senator John Kennedy pressed SEC nominee Paul Atkins about investigating SBF’s parents during Senate hearing.

Kennedy threatened to “pounce like a ninja” for updates on potential SEC investigation.

SBF’s parents allegedly received a $16.4 million Bahamas mansion and millions in other benefits from FTX.

Reports suggest SBF’s parents are seeking a presidential pardon for their son.


The hearing marked Atkins’ nomination process as President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Kennedy used his five-minute questioning period to focus entirely on the FTX case and the role of Bankman-Fried’s parents.

“Every time you come to this committee, I’m going to pounce on you like a ninja to find out what the SEC has done,” Kennedy warned Atkins.


Kennedy’s concerns center on the alleged benefits received by Barbara Fried and Joseph Bankman, both Stanford Law School professors and parents of the convicted FTX founder.

These assets reportedly included a $16.4 million mansion in the Bahamas, $10 million in cash, and another $10 million donation to Fried’s “Mind the Gap” political organization.


Atkins responded cautiously to Kennedy’s questioning.

“Like you, I’m concerned about those reports,” Atkins said.

He explained that he was not at the Commission during the FTX crisis in late 2022.

He agreed to review the SEC’s work on investigating the involvement of Bankman-Fried’s parents when he takes office.


Kennedy also referenced reports that Bankman-Fried’s parents were seeking a presidential pardon for their son.

The pardon reports emerged in January 2025, following President Trump’s pardon of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht.

Bankman-Fried’s parents filed a motion to dismiss the FTX complaint on January 15, 2024.


Recent developments in the SBF case include an unsanctioned prison interview with Tucker Carlson in March 2025.

Following this interview, Bankman-Fried was placed in solitary confinement and transferred from a New York facility to one in Oklahoma.


Kennedy’s line of questioning also touched on Stanford University’s role in the situation.

He pressed Atkins about whether the SEC had investigated the $5.5 million donation to Stanford.

In 2023, the university announced it would return these funds.


The hearing reflected broader conservative skepticism of elite universities.

Kennedy emphasized his belief that “there should not be two standards of law and punishment for people in America.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Carolina's state Rep. Jordan Pace introduced the "Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Act" to allow the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of certain public funds into digital assets, starting with Bitcoin.

The bill, House Bill 4256 (HB4256), proposes that the state treasurer purchase and hold Bitcoin as a strategic reserve within key state-managed funds, including the General Fund and Budget Stabilization Reserve Fund.

With a maximum cap of one million BTC, the bill outlines a secure framework for custody, mandates regular public audits, and allows for voluntary BTC donations from residents.

While BTC is the only digital asset named in the bill, it explicitly states the reserve "may include, but not be limited to, Bitcoin," allowing for the future inclusion of other cryptocurrencies through updated rules.

State Rep. Jordan Pace said on X that he's proud to file legislation that empowers SC to follow Donald Trump's lead to create a state level strategic crypto reserve.

This gives the Treasurer new tools to protect taxpayer dollars from inflation.

In early March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, both of which would be seeded with Bitcoin seized in government criminal cases.

Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) followed up by introducing the BITCOIN Act, which would require the U.S. government to acquire up to one million BTC—worth about $80 billion—over a five-year period.

South Carolina's bill lays out a comprehensive legal structure that includes definitions of cold storage, qualified custodians, and exchange-traded products.

It mandates biennial reports, regular independent security audits, and that any digital asset holdings not exceed 3% of the state’s overall investment portfolio.

The bill would expire on September 1, 2035, unless renewed, giving the state a decade to experiment with incorporating Bitcoin into its public finance strategy.

South Carolina's proposed legislation is also part of a wider nationwide trend of states exploring the viability of adding Bitcoin to their reserves.

Arizona's House recently advanced two major digital asset bills to a full vote, including one that allows the treasurer and retirement system to invest in Bitcoin and another to manage crypto seized from criminal cases.

Texas lawmakers passed Senate Bill 21 Bitcoin strategy reserve bill—SB21—earlier this month, which now awaits the Governor vote.

In Oklahoma, House Bill 1203 passed overwhelmingly and is awaiting Senate review.

Kentucky recently passed legislation protecting Bitcoin self-custody and offering tax incentives for miners.

HB 1203 Bitcoin Strategic Reserve has passed the House in Oklahoma 77-15!

Wyoming lawmakers saw their Bitcoin reserve proposal collapse in committee.

Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Pennsylvania have also abandoned similar bills.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CoreWeave has completed its initial public offering (IPO), raising $1.5 billion by selling 37.5 million shares at $40 each.

The company initially planned to sell 49 million shares at a price range of $47 to $55 per share, but downsized the offering amid a "choppy stock market".

CoreWeave provides access to Nvidia graphics processing units for artificial intelligence training and workloads, positioning itself as a key player in the growing AI infrastructure space.

The New Jersey-based firm recorded nearly $1.9 billion in revenue last year, but reported a net loss of approximately $863 million to $900 million.

Nvidia placed a $250 million order in the offering, strengthening its stake in CoreWeave and showing continued confidence in its business model.

CoreWeave's business requires heavy investment in equipment purchases and real estate expenditures, contributing to ongoing losses despite high revenue.

The IPO represents one of the biggest tech offerings since 2021, serving as a major test for tech startups and the venture capital market.

CoreWeave has strong ties to the cryptocurrency industry through a multi-billion dollar deal with bitcoin miner CoreScientific.

Microsoft is CoreWeave's biggest customer, with other clients including Meta, IBM, and Cohere.

A week after filing to go public, CoreWeave announced a contract with OpenAI worth up to $11.9 billion over five years.

As part of this deal, OpenAI agreed to buy $350 million in CoreWeave stock.

CoreWeave's shares are set to start trading on the Nasdaq on Friday, March 28, 2025, under the ticker symbol "CRWV".

Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, and Goldman Sachs & Co. are acting as joint lead bookrunners for the offering.

The IPO comes at a time when some AI-focused firms have seen weakness in their stock prices, with Nvidia's own stock price down 12% since the beginning of the year.</p>

CEO Sam Altman said "our GPUs are melting" due to viral Studio Ghibli-style AI images.

Free tier users will be limited to three image generations per day.

The trend raised copyright concerns, particularly regarding Studio Ghibli's distinctive animation style.

Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki previously described AI-generated art as "an insult to life itself"

OpenAI has temporarily introduced rate limits for its new image generation feature in ChatGPT after a viral trend of creating Studio Ghibli-style images put too much strain on the company's servers.

The rate limits come just days after OpenAI launched its updated image generation tool.

The feature was released on Tuesday as part of the upgraded ChatGPT-4o model.

Free tier users will soon be limited to three image generations per day.

Altman did not say how long the restrictions would last but said he hoped it "won't be long."

Viral Trend Reveals Both Power and Problems of AI Image Generation

Some of the most popular posts transformed well-known memes.

These included the "distracted boyfriend," "bro explaining," and an image of Ben Affleck smoking.

Even Elon Musk joined in on the trend.

The company says rate limits help manage the load on its infrastructure.

"If requests to the API increase dramatically, it could tax the servers and cause performance issues"

The viral images have also sparked discussions about copyright concerns.

Many have questioned whether using Studio Ghibli's distinctive art style violates copyright protections.

A 2016 video of Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki has been widely shared in response.

Miyazaki describes AI-generated art as "an insult to life itself."

The company expects to more than triple its revenue this year to $12.7 billion.

Altman said in February that his firm plans to release GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 in the coming weeks or months.

These new versions will likely bring even more advanced AI capabilities.

The image generation feature is available to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users.

Enterprise and Education users will gain access next week.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States Department of Justice announced on March 27, 2025, that it has disrupted a terrorist financing operation by seizing approximately $200,000 in cryptocurrency intended to benefit Hamas.

Federal authorities traced the funds from Hamas fundraising addresses that were allegedly controlled by the organization.

These addresses were used to launder more than $1.5 million in virtual currency since October 2024, according to the DOJ press release.


The fundraising effort was coordinated through encrypted online communications. A group chat claiming association with Hamas operated on an encrypted platform to provide supporters worldwide with a changing set of cryptocurrency addresses.

Hamas supporters were encouraged to donate to at least 17 different cryptocurrency wallets. These donations were then funneled into a central operational wallet before being laundered through various means.


The laundering process involved a series of virtual currency exchanges and transactions. The operation leveraged suspected financiers and over-the-counter brokers to move the funds through the financial system.

Among the assets seized were cryptocurrency addresses valued at approximately $89,900. Additionally, three accounts containing cryptocurrency valued at approximately $111,500 were also confiscated by authorities.


The DOJ noted that these accounts were registered in the names of Palestinian individuals. These individuals were reportedly living in Turkey and other countries, though specific locations were not all disclosed.

The case was investigated by multiple FBI divisions. The Albuquerque Field Office worked in coordination with the FBI Counterterrorism Division and Cyber Division to trace and seize the assets.


Several attorneys are handling the prosecution of the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Tejpal Chawla for the District of Columbia is working alongside Trial Attorney Jacques Singer-Emery from the National Security Division’s National Security Cyber Section.

Trial Attorney Jessica Joyce from the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section is also part of the prosecution team.

The DOJ stated that the investigation remains ongoing.


This seizure is part of a broader effort to identify and disrupt Hamas’ attempts to use cryptocurrency for funding.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>France’s state bank Bpifrance will invest €25 million ($27M) in cryptocurrency projects with “strong French footprint”

The investment will focus on DeFi, staking, tokenization, and AI-related blockchain projects.

Bpifrance has already invested over €150 million in blockchain over the past decade.

This initiative is supported by France’s Ministry of Economy and Finance.

The bank cited increasing US crypto activity as motivation for strengthening France’s position.

France’s state-owned bank Bpifrance has announced plans to invest 25 million euros ($27 million) in cryptocurrency and blockchain projects with a “strong French footprint.”

The investment will focus on several key areas in the growing blockchain sector. 

These include decentralized finance (DeFi), staking services, tokenization platforms, and artificial intelligence projects built on blockchain technology.

Bpifrance has been active in the blockchain space for nearly a decade. 

The bank has already invested more than 150 million euros ($162 million) in blockchain projects and supported around 200 French startups in the sector.

One of the bank’s early investments was in Ledger, the crypto hardware wallet company, back in 2014.

Ledger has since grown to become one of France’s most successful blockchain companies.

Morpho has experienced rapid growth since receiving this investment. 

It has become the 12th largest DeFi protocol by value, managing $3.24 billion according to DeFiLlama.

The global blockchain ecosystem is expanding quickly. 

It now includes more than 1,000 investment funds focused on digital assets, with a total market capitalization exceeding 2.7 trillion euros.

Arnaud Caudoux, Deputy CEO of Bpifrance, explained the timing of the announcement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Retail sentiment toward Ethereum is at extreme lows according to Google Trends data.

ETH is currently trading at $2,007, consolidating below key $2,300 resistance.

Technical indicators show mixed signals with some analysts predicting a breakout while others expect a drop to $1,300.


Potential catalysts include Ethereum ETF approval, staking, and the upcoming Pectra update.

ETH must break through $2,040 resistance to prevent further decline toward $1,980 support.

This lack of retail enthusiasm could present buying opportunities for institutional investors. Historically, periods of low retail interest have preceded accumulation phases by larger market participants positioning themselves before price surges.


Several analysts remain optimistic about Ethereum's prospects. Crypto analyst Ted highlights potential catalysts that could spark a breakout, including the possible approval of an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) with staking features.

The upcoming Pectra update represents another development that could help ETH regain momentum. These fundamental improvements to the Ethereum network may attract renewed interest from investors looking for growth potential.


Analyst Crypto Patel supports this outlook, noting that ETH appears to be consolidating within an accumulation range. Based on historical price patterns and on-chain data, Patel expects a breakout after April with an ambitious long-term target of $10,000.

Technical analysis from Titan of Crypto reveals a bullish crossover on Ethereum's weekly Stochastic RSI.


Not all analysts share this positive outlook. Ali Martinez sees “no change in the outlook for Ethereum” and suggests ETH may still drop to around $1,300, representing the lower end of its current price range.

On-chain metrics present a more complex picture. The Market Value to Realized Value Z-score (MVRV-Z) indicates that ETH may be undervalued at current prices.


For Ethereum to confirm a bullish reversal, it must overcome resistance at $2,300. A successful breakthrough could push ETH toward $3,000 in the near term, while failure might result in continued consolidation or further decline.

Short-term price action shows ETH struggling to maintain momentum above $2,020. The cryptocurrency faces immediate resistance around $2,040, with a bearish trend line visible on hourly charts.


If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,040 resistance, it risks another leg down. Initial support lies near $2,000, with stronger support established around $1,980. A break below this level could send ETH toward $1,880 or even $1,820.

The hourly MACD indicator shows weakening momentum in bearish territory. This technical signal, combined with an RSI below 50, suggests short-term pressure remains to the downside.


For a sustained recovery, Ethereum needs to break above $2,095 and then $2,150. Such a move would likely trigger additional buying, potentially pushing the price toward $2,250 or $2,320 in the coming weeks.

Ethereum’s current price action appears driven by a combination of weak retail sentiment and conflicting technical indicators.


While some analysts point to undervaluation and potential catalysts, others see continued downside risk.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) plans to begin authorizing crypto firms in 2026 under a more stringent regulatory regime.

Only 14% of crypto firms have passed the current anti-money laundering registration process, with 50 out of 368 firms approved.

Coinbase recently secured FCA registration, allowing it to offer both cryptocurrency and cash services in the UK.

FCA chief Nikhil Rathi expressed concern over young people investing in high-risk crypto before traditional financial products.

The UK has seen increasing crypto adoption with 12% of adults now owning cryptocurrency, up from 10% previously.


The FCA intends to begin authorizing crypto firms under a new, more stringent regulatory regime in 2026. 

This marks a major shift in how digital assets will be supervised in the country. The current system primarily focuses on anti-money laundering compliance.

Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets at the FCA, revealed these plans in a recent interview.


The FCA has been selective in its approach to crypto registration so far. 

Of the 368 firms that applied for the current anti-money laundering register since 2020, only 50 have been approved. This represents a success rate of just 14%.

The new authorization process will be more comprehensive than the current system. 

It will cover a wider range of activities including stablecoins, trading platforms, and staking services.


Long indicated that the FCA will release several consultation papers this year. 

These will address stablecoins, trading platforms, staking, and prudential crypto exposure.

The final policies are expected to be published before the regime goes live in 2026.


Speaking at the Treasury Select Committee, Nikhil Rathi said the FCA will always be anchored to its primary objectives. 

It aims to protect consumers, ensure market integrity and promote competition in the interest of consumers while also playing its role in supporting growth.

The FCA plans to adapt existing financial regulations to fit this new asset class.


The transition process for currently registered firms remains undecided. 

Even registered companies may need to go through another application process if they want the “wider permissions” offered under the new regime.


The FCA is looking at international models as it formulates its approach. 

This includes examining Europe’s bespoke crypto legislation and the International Organization of Securities Commissions’ recommendations.

The goal is to understand and implement global best practices.


Coinbase, one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently secured registration with the FCA. 

This achievement allows the company to offer both cryptocurrency and cash services to UK customers.

Keith Grose, Coinbase’s UK CEO, expressed enthusiasm about this development. 

“It opens up new channels and opens up the ability to launch new products and services,” he stated.


The FCA's approach comes amid growing crypto adoption in the UK. 

Recent findings show that 93% of UK citizens are now aware of cryptocurrencies, up from 91% previously.

Furthermore, 12% of UK adults now own crypto, an increase from 10% in earlier surveys.


Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, recently expressed worry about young people's investment choices. 

Speaking to MPs, he noted that too many Britons under 35 are making crypto their first investment.

Rathi described these investments as “very highly risky” and warned that investors could lose all their money.


The FCA chief also noted that the UK has a “low level” of share ownership compared to countries like the US or Sweden. 

He attributed this to “a mix of tax, education, regulation and broader culture.” As part of its new strategy, the FCA aims to encourage more investment in equity or bond markets.


The regulator's approach to crypto remains cautious. 

The FCA has repeatedly warned that crypto investments remain largely unregulated and high-risk in the UK.

“If something goes wrong, it is unlikely you will be protected so you should be prepared to lose all your money,” the FCA stated last year.


Despite these concerns, the UK’s crypto ecosystem continues to develop. 

The 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis ranked the UK 12th in its overall ranking of countries.

This suggests that despite regulatory caution, crypto adoption continues to grow.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin is currently trading at around $85,880, down 3.16% over the past month.

 

Analyst Jamie Coutts predicts BTC could reach $123,000 by June in the best-case scenario, based on easing financial conditions and a weakening US dollar. He forecasts a range from $102,000 to $123,000 by June 1, representing a 13% gain over its current all-time high of $109,000.

 

Data from Polymarket suggests BTC could hit $138,617 by the end of 2025—a 60% jump from today's price. This represents "a market regaining its footing after tariff-related uncertainty."

 

Technical Analysis

Bitcoin is testing a critical resistance zone near $88,000, aligning with its 50-day moving average. A breakout above this level could pave the way for a retest of its all-time high near $108,000.

 

Multiple forecasts from major financial institutions support the possibility of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 again in 2025. JPMorgan predicts $145,000 with 3x Lightning Network growth, while Bloomberg Intelligence forecasts $135,000 if BTC reaches 20% of gold's market cap.

 

The upcoming record-breaking $16.5 billion monthly options expiry on March 28 could impact the market. The total open interest for call (buy) options stands at $10.5 billion, while put (sell) options lag at $6 billion.

 

Bulls hold a strategic advantage if Bitcoin remains above $86,500. In this scenario, only $2 billion worth of put options will be in play, compared to $3.3 billion in call options.

 

Despite ongoing concerns about the global tariff war and US government spending cuts, Bitcoin bulls remain hopeful for a decoupling from the stock market.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced USDT has surpassed 400 million users globally.

Tether is open to creating a domestic US stablecoin amid regulatory changes.

Tether has engaged a “Big Four” firm for a full audit of its finances.

The company is diversifying beyond crypto through media and agricultural investments.

Despite USDC’s growth, USDT still dominates with $357 billion in transaction volume versus USDC’s $207 billion.

A new era begins: the stablecoin multiverse. Hundreds of companies and governments are launching (or will soon) their stablecoins.

This prediction follows news that Fidelity Investments is entering the stablecoin space.

Fidelity’s digital assets division, which already handles Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, will lead this initiative.

On the regulatory front, Ardoino has opened the door to creating a domestic US stablecoin.

We are going to watch the bill for the requirements of the US domestic stablecoins and we would be open to create a domestic stablecoin in the US.

He noted this would require a different business model.

The US market is one Tether has not actively targeted before, making this a potential new growth area.

Tether’s relationship with regulators has been rocky.

In 2021, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) ordered Tether to pay $42.5 million in fines over reserve disclosures.

The company has recently worked to improve its image.

We work with the DOJ almost daily, and the Treasury.

Tether now has a connection in the US government.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, previously Chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, has been a vocal supporter of Tether.

Under Lutnick’s leadership, Cantor Fitzgerald began managing Tether’s reserves in late 2021 and acquired a 5% ownership stake.

In addressing long-standing questions about its reserves, Tether is working with one of the “Big Four” professional services firms.

This full audit is a “top priority” according to Ardoino.

Earlier this month, Tether appointed Simon McWilliams as its new CFO.

The new executive is expected to help facilitate this full audit.

Tether’s Strategic Expansion Beyond Crypto

The company became the second-largest shareholder of Be Water, an Italian media company that controls Will and Chora Media.

Tether secured a 30.4% stake following a €10 million capital increase.

This media investment gives Tether influence in digital content distribution.

According to company statements, Tether plans to enhance digital content distribution and integrate new technological solutions.

The stablecoin issuer is also entering agriculture.

Tether has a transaction agreement with Adecoagro S.A., a sustainable production firm in South America.

Adecoagro focuses on sustainable agricultural practices in South America.

This investment represents Tether’s largest entry into conventional markets beyond financial technology.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Solana's native token SOL has been struggling to reclaim the $150 level, facing an 8% rejection after briefly touching $147 on March 25.

 

Solana’s DApp revenues have dropped from $23.7 million to $12 million in just two weeks, while chain fees fell from $6.6 million to $3.6 million.

 

Technical analysis shows SOL forming a bearish falling wedge pattern with potential for a 12% drop to $120 if it breaks below the $136 support level.

 

Solana has lost its dominant position in DEX volumes to BNB Chain despite having 34% more total value locked.

 

The Solana network is facing ongoing resistance at the $150 price level, which has persisted for three weeks now.

 

Some market watchers believe SOL could still benefit from future developments, including a potential spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the United States.

 

Nikita Bier, co-founder of TBH and Gas startups, remains optimistic about Solana’s future, citing its streamlined onboarding experience for mobile users as a key advantage.

 

The memecoin boom introduced millions of new users to Web3 wallets and decentralized applications, but on-chain volumes have plunged since the mania faded.

 

Solana is also facing growing competition from other blockchains, adding pressure on SOL’s price.

 

On March 6, President Trump signed a bill allowing the US Treasury to acquire Bitcoin, which mentioned that altcoins in government possession could be strategically sold.

 

The Solana ecosystem extends beyond memecoin trading and token launchpads, with total value locked (TVL) growing across various platforms.

 

Recent data shows Solana’s DApp revenues totaled $12 million in the seven days leading up to March 24, a sharp decline from $23.7 million just two weeks earlier.

 

Solana has lost its position as the dominant network in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, with BNB Chain surging to the top spot despite having 34% less TVL than Solana.

 

Technical analysis indicates SOL has formed a bearish falling wedge pattern, similar to what Bitcoin is currently showing.

 

At press time, SOL was trading near $137.5, reflecting a 4.76% price drop in the past 24 hours.

 

The price drop has brought SOL to the neckline of a bearish head and shoulders pattern, with technical analysts suggesting that if SOL closes a four-hour candle below $136, it could drop by 12%.

 

SOL has also faced rejection from a descending trendline that has acted as resistance since January 2025.

 

Intraday traders appear to be betting against the bearish sentiment, holding $167 million worth of long positions at the $135 level.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially closed its investigation into cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com without taking any enforcement action.

The SEC had previously issued a Wells Notice to Crypto.com, indicating it was considering enforcement action against the company. In response, Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the SEC in October 2024, claiming the regulatory agency had overstepped its authority in regulating cryptocurrency tokens as securities.


Crypto.com withdrew its lawsuit in December following Donald Trump's election victory. The exchange expressed satisfaction with the SEC's decision to close its investigation without taking any enforcement action. Nick Lundgren, Chief Legal Officer at Crypto.com, stated that the current SEC leadership has made the decision to close its investigation with no enforcement action or settlement.


Lundgren criticized the previous SEC administration's approach to cryptocurrency regulation, claiming they had "weaponized and attempted to expand its congressionally granted power" to harm the industry. Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, described the previous administration's regulatory stance as a "war on crypto."


Crypto.com maintains over 100 regulatory approvals worldwide, including state money transmitter licenses in more than 40 U.S. states. The exchange has also secured registrations with key U.S. agencies, such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.


The SEC's decision to end its investigation aligns with a recent shift in its approach under acting Chair Mark Uyeda. The agency has withdrawn lawsuits against several crypto companies in recent weeks.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Carolina has dismissed its lawsuit against Coinbase over staking services, joining Vermont.

Eight other states including California and Illinois still have similar lawsuits active.

Coinbase's CLO Paul Grewal claims SC residents lost $2 million in staking rewards due to the ban.

A new bill introduced in South Carolina could allocate up to 10% of certain state funds to Bitcoin.

South Carolina has dismissed its lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase related to staking services. The state's Attorney General's securities division officially dropped the case in a joint stipulation with the crypto company on March 27, 2025.

This makes South Carolina the second state to withdraw such legal action, following Vermont's similar dismissal earlier this month.

The lawsuit was part of a coordinated action by ten states filed on June 6, 2023. These states accused Coinbase of offering unregistered securities through its crypto staking services.

Staking allows crypto holders to earn rewards by locking their assets to help validate blockchain transactions.

Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, celebrated the dismissal on social media.

South Carolina residents lost an estimated $2 million in staking rewards as a result of the restrictions.

The legal executive confirmed that staking services are now live again in South Carolina across all Coinbase platforms, including the app and website.

Eight states continue to maintain similar lawsuits against Coinbase. These include Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, Washington, and Wisconsin.

All these states have claimed that Coinbase's staking program needed to be registered under their securities laws.

The original legal actions came on the same day the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed its own lawsuit against Coinbase.

The SEC dropped its case against the exchange on February 27, 2025, potentially signaling a shift in regulatory approach toward crypto staking.

In a separate but related development, state representative Jordan Pace introduced the "Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Act of South Carolina."

This proposed legislation would allow the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of certain state funds to cryptocurrencies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brianna "Bri" Stern, the model and crypto influencer behind the Solana-based meme coin SISTER, has filed a civil lawsuit against Andrew Tate.

Stern shared details of her allegations on social media Thursday evening. She stated that she met Tate as part of a modeling project for his cryptocurrency, DADDY, where he also promised to help support her own meme coin, SISTER.

According to media reports from TMZ and the LA Times, the lawsuit accuses Tate of sexual assault, battery, and gender violence. These alleged incidents occurred during what Stern describes as a 10-month relationship with Tate.

The model claims what began as consensual sex turned violent. In her account, Tate began verbally degrading, choking, and beating her during the encounter at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

Stern sought medical attention at a New York hospital following the alleged incident. Medical records obtained by TMZ show she was diagnosed with “Post-Concussion Syndrome,” suggesting she may have suffered a mild traumatic brain injury.

In her social media posts, Stern quoted Tate as allegedly saying, “Shut the fuck up, bitch. You will never backtalk me. You are my property.” This statement forms part of her claims about the verbal abuse she endured.

The lawsuit seeks unspecified statutory and punitive damages from Tate. Stern will be represented by Buzbee Law, one of the firms currently representing alleged victims of Sean “Diddy” Combs in separate legal matters.

Tate's legal representatives from New York-based McBride Law told the LA Times that the lawsuit was a “blatant cash grab” meant as a “desperate attempt” to exploit their client.

The Beverly Hills police did not immediately return requests for confirmation or comments when contacted by media outlets. A digital copy of the lawsuit has not yet appeared in public records, making the full details of the allegations unavailable.

Stern's SISTER token surged by over 290% in the past 24 hours, reaching a market cap of $370,000 with approximately 550 holders, according to data from GeckoTerminal.

Tate faces separate rape and human trafficking charges in Romania alongside his brother Tristan. They were allowed to leave Romania while awaiting trial on these charges.

The lawsuit connects two worlds that don’t often intersect in legal proceedings – the emerging crypto meme coin market and allegations of physical assault.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>XRP has regulatory clarity after the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Ripple.

Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped its lawsuit against Ripple.

These developments remove a cloud that had been hanging over the token for years.

XRP's price has been hovering around the $2.33 mark, showing a 4% drop in the last 24 hours.

Despite this short-term dip, the cryptocurrency has made a strong recovery from its local lows in mid-March.

Market watchers are now turning their attention to what might come next for this well-established digital asset.

Several crypto analysts have shared bullish predictions for XRP in recent days.

Dark Defender believes XRP could eventually surpass both Bitcoin and Ethereum in market dominance.

The positive outlook comes primarily from XRP's improved regulatory status.

XRP has been struggling to break through the $2.50 resistance level.

A brief breakthrough last week failed to hold above this key mark, leading to a period of consolidation.

Analyst Mikybull Crypto compared the current price pattern to the one seen before XRP's famous 2017 bull run.

Based on this comparison, the analyst forecasts a price range of $5 to $10 for XRP during this market cycle.

Dark Defender offered an even more optimistic view, pointing to a bullish rectangle pattern in XRP's recent price action.

This consolidation will be over very soon, and the next leg will welcome new all-time highs.

Several factors could help drive XRP toward these price targets.

One key catalyst is the potential approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Market expert Nate Geraci noted that an XRP ETF approval is becoming more likely, with data from Polymarket showing an 87% probability of approval within the year.

The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 opened doors for mainstream and institutional investors.

A similar approval for XRP could bring a new wave of investment into the token.

Major players like Bitwise and 21Shares filed for XRP ETFs late last year.

Ripple's own stablecoin, RLUSD, launched in December, could also play a role in XRP's growth.

The stablecoin is appearing on more exchanges and aims to capture a portion of the $234 billion stablecoin market.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GameStop's short sales volume increased 234%, reaching 30.85 million shares.

 
The NYSE imposed a Short Sale Restriction after GME stock fell 22%.

 
GameStop announced plans to purchase Bitcoin using proceeds from a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering.

 
Short volume approached levels seen during the famous 2021 short squeeze.

 
Analysts question the strategic value of GameStop’s Bitcoin acquisition plans.

 
On March 27, GameStop's short sales volume surged to 30.85 million shares, representing a massive 234% increase in just 24 hours.

The NYSE quickly moved to impose a Short Sale Restriction (SSR) on GameStop stock, which automatically activates when a stock drops more than 10% from the previous day’s closing price and remains in effect for the rest of that trading day and the following day.

 
GameStop shares plunged 22% during the trading session, completely erasing the 12% gain the stock had experienced following its Bitcoin announcement.

 
The selloff resulted in an estimated $3 billion loss in market capitalization in a single day.

 
GameStop did not specify exactly how much Bitcoin it plans to purchase.

However, after markets closed on March 26, the company announced a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering, with proceeds intended for “general corporate purposes, including acquiring Bitcoin.”

 
Convertible notes are a form of debt that can later be converted into equity.

Some analysts believe the announcement of this debt offering contributed to the stock’s decline, as it could potentially dilute existing shareholders’ stakes.

 
Han Akamatsu drew parallels to Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), noting that when “MSTR issued $1.05B of 0% convertible notes, the stock dipped after the announcement due to hedging shorts, but later exploded when Bitcoin ripped and the arbitrage unspooled.”

 
Market experts have expressed doubts about GameStop’s Bitcoin strategy.

Tom Sosnoff, founder and CEO of Tastylive, told Yahoo Finance that GameStop's decision to buy Bitcoin feels “a little dot-comish” to him, comparing it to companies that added “.com” to their names during the internet bubble to attract investor interest without clear strategic justification.

 
Bret Kenwell, a US investment analyst at eToro, echoed these concerns, telling Reuters that “investors are not necessarily optimistic on the underlying business” of GameStop, calling into question the long-term viability of the Bitcoin pivot.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following a sharp multi-week selloff that dragged Bitcoin from above $100,000 to below $80,000, the recent price bounce has traders debating whether the Bitcoin bull market is truly back on track or if this is merely a bear market rally before the next macro leg higher.

Bitcoin’s Local Bottom or Bull Market Pause?

Bitcoin’s latest correction was deep enough to rattle confidence, but shallow enough to maintain macro trend structure. Price seems to have set a local bottom between $76K–$77K, and several reliable metrics are beginning to solidify the local lows and point towards further upside.

The Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) is one of the most reliable sentiment gauges across Bitcoin cycles. As price fell, NUPL dropped into “Anxiety” territory, but following the rebound, NUPL has now reclaimed the “Belief” zone, a critical sentiment transition historically seen at macro higher lows.

The Value Days Destroyed (VDD) Multiple weighs BTC spending by both coin age and transaction size, and compares the data to a previous yearly average, giving insight into long term holder behavior. Current readings have reset to low levels, suggesting that large, aged coins are not being moved. This is a clear signal of conviction from smart money.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Boost Bull Market

We’re also now seeing the Long Term Holder Supply beginning to climb. After profit-taking above $100K, long-term participants are now re-accumulating at lower levels. Historically, these phases of accumulation have set the foundation for supply squeezes and subsequent parabolic price action.

Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Signal Bull Market Cross

The Hash Ribbons Indicator has just completed a bullish crossover, where the short-term hash rate trend moves above the longer-term average. This signal has historically aligned with bottoms and trend reversals.

Bitcoin Bull Market Tied to Stocks

Despite bullish on-chain data, Bitcoin remains closely tied to macro liquidity trends and equity markets, particularly the S&P 500. As long as that correlation holds, BTC will be partially at the mercy of global monetary policy, risk sentiment, and liquidity flows.

Bitcoin Bull Market Outlook

From a data-driven perspective, Bitcoin looks increasingly well-positioned for a sustained continuation of its bull cycle. On-chain metrics paint a compelling picture of resilience for the Bitcoin bull market.

The Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) has shifted from “Anxiety” during the dip to the “Belief” zone after the rebound—a transition often seen at macro higher lows. Similarly, the Value Days Destroyed (VDD) Multiple has reset to levels signaling conviction among long-term holders, echoing patterns before Bitcoin’s rallies in 2016/17 and 2020/21.

These metrics point to structural strength, bolstered by long-term holders aggressively accumulating supply below $80,000. Further supporting this, the Hash Ribbons indicator’s recent bullish crossover reflects growing miner confidence in Bitcoin’s profitability, a reliable sign of trend reversals historically.

This accumulation phase suggests the Bitcoin bull market may be gearing up for a supply squeeze, a dynamic that has fueled parabolic moves before. The data collectively highlights resilience, not weakness, as long-term holders seize the dip as an opportunity.

However, macro conditions still warrant caution, as the Bitcoin bull market doesn’t operate in isolation. Bull markets take time to build momentum, often needing steady accumulation and favorable conditions to ignite the next leg higher.

The local bottom between $76K–$77K seems to hold, but the path forward won’t likely feature vertical candles of peak euphoria yet. Bitcoin’s tie to the S&P 500 and global liquidity trends means volatility could emerge from shifts in monetary policy or risk sentiment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Carolina legislators on Thursday presented the "Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Law", a bill that would allow the state treasurer to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptoactives to specific limits.

The bill, also known as H4256, allows the state treasurer to invest uninvested funds from the General Fund, Budget Stabilization Fund and other investment funds managed by the State in cryptoactive.

The investment would be limited to 10% of the total funds under management, with a maximum bitcoin reserve limit of one million bitcoins.

According to the proposed legislation, cryptoactives must be maintained directly by the state treasurer through a secure custody solution, by a qualified custodian, or in products negotiated in the stock market issued by regulated financial institutions. The project prohibits the cryptoactive loan.

Bitcoin, such as a decentralized cryptocurrency, and other cryptoactives offer unique properties that can act as protection against inflation and economic volatility.

It also helps diversify state funds.

The legislation requires a biennial report of cryptoactive holdings and their value in US dollars.

For greater transparency, the public directions of all cryptoactives must be published on an official state website. The state treasurer must also implement regular tests and audits of cryptoactive management processes.

The bill allows residents of South Carolina to make cryptoactive donations to the reservation through an approved suppliers process.

If promulgated, the legislation would remain in force until September 1, 2035.

At the same time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) channels its way to its presale phase, accumulating 6,800 holders and $4.9 million.

Ethereum’s 24 hour trade volume at $11.54 billion evidence continuing interest regardless of bearish signals.

The 50-day SMA ($2,438) is lurking above as a resistance, but 2031 forecasts of $58,140 keep ETH in the limelight.

Its decentralized smart contract framework is unequaled, but it has exhibited price swings—13 percent volatility this month—that could put short-term traders at risk.

Despite the Fear and Greed Index remaining put at 31, long-term holders gambling on Ethereum’s programmability and scalability are undeterred by the recent price action.

With Phase 3 reaching its final stages, all eyes are on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as it holds the crown for 2025 top crypto.

More than 75% of the Tokens has been claimed – high demand before the next price increase Phase 4 will see a guaranteed 25% profit for investors joining now.

Competitive yields for lenders are stirred up by the protocol’s dynamic interest rates, while borrowers gain access to liquidity without requiring them to liquidate assets.

mtTokens, including mtETH or mtDAI, are compound value assets, which combine passive income with liquidity.

Having raised $4.9 million, the team made security a top priority finishing a Certik audit to ensure the smart contract is bug-proof and finally ensuring that the contract is secure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the world of traditional finance, evaluating a company’s success usually means tracking revenue growth, earnings per share, or return on equity.

That’s the question facing a new class of Bitcoin treasury companies. These are publicly traded firms whose central mission is to acquire and hold Bitcoin over the long term.

This article introduces those tools—new key performance indicators (KPIs) designed to evaluate how well a company is executing its Bitcoin strategy.

Many of these indicators have been pioneered by Michael Saylor and his company, Strategy, where they can be seen implemented on their new dashboard.

1. BTC Yield: Measuring Accretion, Not Earnings

What it is: BTC Yield tracks the percentage change over time in the ratio between a company’s Bitcoin holdings and its fully diluted share count.

Why it matters: This KPI is designed to answer a unique question: Is the company acquiring Bitcoin in a way that benefits shareholders?

Let’s say a company holds 10,000 BTC and has 100 million diluted shares. That’s 0.1 BTC per share.

If, a year later, it holds 12,000 BTC and has 105 million shares, it now holds ~0.114 BTC per share—a 14% increase.

That 14% is your BTC Yield.

What makes it unique: BTC Yield doesn’t care about profit margins or EBITDA.

It’s focused on how effectively the company is increasing Bitcoin ownership relative to the number of shares that could exist.

This is key in a strategy that involves using equity to buy BTC. If management is printing new shares to buy Bitcoin, shareholders want to know: is the Bitcoin per share going up?

2. BTC Gain: Translating Accretion into BTC

What it is: BTC Gain shows shareholder-accretive growth translated into BTC terms.

Why it matters: This metric gives a clear picture of how much the company’s Bitcoin position has grown.

It’s calculated by subtracting the initial number of Bitcoins from the current number of Bitcoins and expressing the result as a percentage increase.

3. BTC $Gain: Putting Accretion in Dollars

What it is: BTC $Gain puts shareholder-accretive growth into dollar terms.

Why it matters: This metric gives investors an idea of how much value has been created for shareholders.

It’s calculated by multiplying the number of Bitcoins acquired by the current price of Bitcoin.

4. Bitcoin NAV: Showing Raw Bitcoin Value

What it is: Bitcoin NAV shows raw Bitcoin value without accounting for debt or financial obligations.

Why it matters: This metric gives a snapshot of the company’s Bitcoin position in dollar terms.

5. BTC Rating: The Leverage Check You Don’t Have to Guess About

What it is: BTC Rating is a simple ratio that divides the market value of the company’s Bitcoin by its total financial obligations.

Why it matters: This metric gives a quick picture of whether the company's Bitcoin strategy is supported by a sound capital structure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>France-based public investment bank Bpifrance announced plans to invest $27 million (€25 million) directly into tokens and decentralized technologies.

Bpifrance's investment seeks to accelerate its "digital asset investment strategy" by bolstering French crypto startups and assisting local venture capital players in Web3.

The bank's Deputy CEO, Arnaud Caudoux, said they are convinced of the growing importance of these players and want to increase French competitiveness in digital assets.

Bpifrance's new fund will target blockchain-native models with a strong "French footprint," including DeFi, staking, tokenization, Layer 1–3 protocols, AI-driven tools, and digital ID solutions.

The investment represents one of the first moves by a major state investment bank to purchase open-market crypto tokens.

Bpifrance will specifically target "smaller, newly-issued tokens" from French projects that have yet to be listed on exchanges.

This move is seen as a response to developments in the U.S., where President Donald Trump has pledged to make the nation the "undisputed Bitcoin superpower."

In 2023, Bpifrance's Blockchain & Crypto Lead Ivan de Lastours said the bank was exploring zero-knowledge proofs and their potential to verify authenticity.

The announcement comes at a time when France's regulatory bodies are intensifying scrutiny of the crypto sector.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled to $83,800 recently, down 3.8% over the past 24 hours.

The broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index declined 5.7%, with native cryptos Avalanche (AVAX), Polygon (POL), Near (NEAR), and Uniswap (UNI) all nursing almost 10% losses during the same period.

Today's sell-off wiped out $115 billion of the total market value of cryptocurrencies, TradingView data shows.

Ethereum's ether (ETH) declined over 6% to extend its downtrend against BTC, falling to its weakest relative price to the largest cryptocurrency since May 2020.

Underscoring the bearish trend, spot ETH exchange-traded funds failed to attract any net inflows since early March, while their BTC counterparts saw over $1 billion of inflows in the past two weeks, according to Farside Investors data.

The ugly crypto price action coincided with U.S. stocks selling off during the day on poor economic data, with the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index down 2% and 2.8%, respectively.

Crypto-focused stocks also suffered heavy losses: Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate BTC holder, closed the day 10% lower, while crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) dropped 7.7%.

The February PCE inflation report showed a 2.5% year-over-year increase in the price index, with core inflation at 2.8%, slightly above expectations.

Consumer spending showed a modest 0.4% rise, though inflation-adjusted figures indicate minimal growth, suggesting potential headwinds for economic growth.

The Federal Reserve of Atlanta's GDPNow model now projects the U.S. economy to contract 2.8% in the first quarter, 0.5% adjusted for gold imports and exports, spurring stagflationary fears.

Bitcoin has closely correlated with the Nasdaq lately, so U.S. equities rolling over for another leg down could weigh on the broader crypto market.

However, today's decline could be BTC filling the price gap at around $84,000-$85,000 between Monday's open and the previous week's close on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures market.

"At this stage it’s difficult to determine if we have already seen a bottom in 2025," Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, said in a market note.

"Any additional setbacks that we might see should be exceptionally well supported into the $70-75k area," he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, has been granted a pardon by U.S. President Donald Trump.

The White House confirmed the pardon on Friday, along with those of his co-founders Samuel Reed and Benjamin Delo.

In 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) brought charges against BitMEX and its founders for violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).

Prosecutors alleged BitMEX advertised itself as a place where customers could use its platform virtually anonymously without providing basic know-your-customer (KYC) information.

All four individuals eventually pleaded guilty and were sentenced to fines and probationary sentences.

Hayes faced two years of probation, while Delo spent 30 months on probation and Reed 18 months on probation.

The exchange itself pleaded guilty to violating the BSA last year and was ordered to pay $100 million for violating other CFTC regulations in 2021.

Delo said he and his colleagues had been "wrongfully targeted" by the DOJ.

He stated that the pardon is a vindication of their position and an acknowledgment that they should never have been charged with a criminal offense.

The reported pardons come after Trump granted similar pardons to other individuals, including Trevor Milton and Ross Ulbricht.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has vacuumed up 506,137 bitcoin in about five years.

The company seems to have a magic pool of funds from which to draw on to buy more bitcoin, but it acquired a sizable chunk of its stash by issuing billions of dollars in equity and convertible notes (debt securities that can be converted into equity).

However, the price of bitcoin has been pushed down about 20% since peaking above $109,000 two months ago.

The company's average acquisition price has risen to $66,000, and it is really only one more moderate swing down in price from being in the red on its buys.

Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, said it is highly unlikely that Strategy would have to liquidate a bunch of bitcoin because it gets margin called.

The debt is very likely to be refinanced for the convertible notes, and the firm has even refrained from posting its bitcoin holdings as collateral for loans.

The company currently employs three different methods for raising capital: issuing equity, convertible notes, or preferred stock.

Issuing equity means creating new MSTR shares and selling them on the market, but it creates selling pressure on MSTR and can potentially push the stock downward.

Convertible notes have allowed Strategy to raise funds quickly without diluting MSTR stock, offering a solid yield and allowing investors to benefit if the stock surges.

Strategy has begun deploying preferred stocks, which tend to appeal to investors seeking lower volatility and more predictable returns through dividends.

The company is issuing all of these different types of investment vehicles to create demand for Strategy for all kinds of investors that may have different tolerances to risk.

Strategy now finds itself in a situation where it must pay 8% dividends on STRK, 10% dividends on STRF, and a blend of 0.4% interest rate on its convertible bonds.

With Strategy's software business providing very little cash flow, finding the funds to pay for all of these dividends might be tricky.

The company will likely need to keep issuing MSTR stock to pay the interest it owes, which will hurt the share price.

In the most extreme scenario, the stock could trade at a discount from its bitcoin holdings because Michael Saylor would have to issue shares to pay interest and cover cash flow.

Saylor lost controlling voting power over the company in 2024 due to the continuous issuance of MSTR stock.

Another potential risk for MSTR holders is that the 2x long Strategy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) issued by T-Rex and Defiance, MSTX and MSTU, have seen weirdly persistent demand despite the stock's drawdown.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.K.'s crypto industry has just over 12 months to prepare for an even stricter regulatory regime, a senior official with the country's finance regulator said.

Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets at the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told CoinDesk in an interview that the "impending gateway regime" that is earmarked for 2026 will in fact be a new authorization regime for crypto companies.

"We will have a gateway which will allow authorization. But obviously we've got to go through those consultations, create those rules and get the legislation for that to take place," Long said.

This regime will be a leap from the current anti-money laundering (AML) one. Firms like crypto exchanges Coinbase, Gemini and Bitpanda will move away from just needing to register with the country to comply with anti-money laundering rules to an authorization regime with rules for a suite of offerings.

The FCA intends to release papers on stablecoins, trading platforms, staking, prudential crypto exposure and more this year. The regime is expected to go live after final policy papers are published in 2026, Long said.

Since its anti-money laundering register for firms opened in 2020, the FCA received 368 applications from firms wishing to comply, but only 50 firms — 14% of applicants — have been approved so far. Many firms may have to start again.

Upcoming legislation will define what counts as a regulated activity, the FCA's Long said. Companies that engage in those activities will need to seek authorization.

Stablecoins will no longer be brought under the U.K. payments regulations as set out in previous work, former Economic Secretary Tulip Siddiq said in November. The FCA plans to consult on draft rules for stablecoins early this year.

"What we're doing in terms of the stablecoins is we're making sure that we take the best from the current regulation that exists in TradFi, but stablecoins are ultimately unique," Long said. "There isn't anything that is exactly the same. We've got to adapt the regulation that we've currently got."

The FCA is still deciding on the process crypto companies will need to go through to get authorized, Long said.

Long added that it was undecided what steps those who are already registered in the money laundering regime will need to take but the new regime will come with wider permissions," so we'd expect that if you wanted the further permissions, you'd apply for them."

In formulating how it intends to move forward, the regulator plans to also look at Europe which has launched bespoke legislation for the crypto sector and the International Organization of Securities Commissions' 18 recommendations.

"It's a case of understanding and looking for best practice," Long said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Baanx, a cryptocurrency debit card enabler, has introduced a rewards wallet combining on-chain finance with traditional loyalty perks and discounts.

Built on Circle's programmable wallet tech, the Baanx platform allows crypto holders access to cashback, fee discounts, subscription perks and exclusive gated experiences.

An ongoing convergence between traditional card networks and the on-chain world of stablecoins and decentralized finance has seen partnerships between Mastercard and Web3 wallets like MetaMask.

The rewards wallet offering helps bridge the gap between blockchain and everyday financial needs, said Baanx Chief Commercial Officer Simon Jones.

"We've built the Rewards Wallet using Circle to offer rewards on a crypto debit card that are unprecedented," Jones said in an interview. "For instance, if you look at the MataMask card, it's up to 6% cash-back for the first month."

Circle offers programmable wallet infrastructure that allows for adding features to multiple crypto projects without having to change the user interface.

"We are pushing USDC as the main treasury token and incentive program within these products, as opposed to Tether [USDT]," he said.</p>

The bank will buy and hold crypto tokens related to decentralized finance (DeFi) tokenization, staking and staking, it said on Thursday.

"Having the ability to invest directly in digital assets is a significant step forward for Bpifrance and a pioneering initiative among sovereign wealth funds," the bank said.

France emerged as a burgeoning crypto hub in 2022 as it sought to pre-empt the introduction of the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation and tempted a number of prominent cryptocurrency firms to make the country their European base.</p>

The FDIC is the main federal supervisor of thousands of banks, managing governmental support for the banking sector. It has played an important role in the saga of cryptocurrency exclusion. Recently, there was a judicial dispute with the Coinbase crypto exchange platform.

In 2022 correspondence between the regulator and supervised banks, the FDIC ordered them to remain away from new matters related to crypto while policies were being defined. However, the agency never developed any policies and left bankers in limbo.

The FDIC has issued a new industry guide after President Donald Trump's administration expressed support for cryptocurrencies. The agency aims to provide clearer guidelines on how banks can participate in activities related to blockchain and cryptocurrency safely.

With this decision, banks that were previously required to obtain prior approvals can now advance in crypto matters while considering proper risk assessment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The hopes that the recovery of the crypto continued faded on Friday, when a fall throughout the market deleted virtually all profits from the beginning of this week.

Bitcoin (BTC) recently collapsed to $83,800 and has dropped 3.8% in the last 24 hours. The COINDESK 20 reference index fell 5.7%, with native cryptocurrencies Avalanche (Avax), Polygon (POL), Near (Near), and UNISWAP (UNI) registering losses of almost 10% during the same period.

The Ether of Ethereum (ETH) fell more than 6% to extend its bearish trend against BTC, falling at its weakest relative price against the largest cryptocurrency in the last two weeks. 

Today's liquidation eliminated $115 billion of the total market value of cryptocurrencies. The unfavorable action of the crypto price coincided with the fall of US actions during the day due to bad economic data.

The February PCE inflation report showed an interannual increase of 2.5% in the price index, with a Core inflation of 2.8%, slightly above expectations. Consumer spending showed a modest increase of 0.4%, although inflation-adjusted figures indicate minimum growth.

Bitcoin has maintained a close correlation with the Nasdaq lately, so a new fall in US actions could affect the crypto market in general. However, from a more optimistic perspective, today's fall could indicate that BTC is covering the price gap between $84,000 and $85,000 between Monday's opening and the closure of the previous week in the futures market of the Chicago Mercantile Stock Exchange.

"At this time, it is difficult to determine if we have already touched the bottom," said Joel Kruger, Lmax Group market strategist. Despite the current correction, Kruger pointed out several positive trends.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arthur Hayes, former executive director of Bitmex, received a pardon from President Donald Trump.

 
Trump also pardoned Hayes' co-founders in Bitmex, Samuel Reed and Benjamin Delo.

 
In 2020, the US Department of Justice claimed that Bitmex was promoted as a place where customers could use their platform anonymously without providing basic customer information.

The four individuals eventually pleaded guilty and were sentenced to fines and probation.

Bitmex itself declared guilty to violating the BSA last year.

Hayes faced two years of probation; Delo to 30 months and Reed to 18. Dwyer received 12 months of probation.

 
In a statement, Delo said he and his colleagues had been "unjustly attacked" by a "dark and outdated law".

The Basic Products Trade Commission ordered Bitmex to pay $100 million to violate the Basic Products Exchange Law in 2021.

 
The lawyers representing Hayes, Delo and Reed did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

 
Trevor Milton, former executive director of Nikola Motors, received a pardon from Trump on the day before Hayes' pardon was announced.

 
Since Ulbricht's pardon, Sam Bankman-Fried has been seeking his own pardon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Led by executive president Michael Saylor, Microstrategy has accumulated 506,137 Bitcoin (BTC), with an current value of approximately US $44,000 million at the current BTC price.

The company acquired a considerable part of its reserves by issuing billions of dollars in shares, convertible bonds and preferred shares, which offers investors dividends.

The price of Bitcoin has fallen approximately 20% since it reached its maximum of US $109,000 two months ago. The average acquisition price of Strategy is now at US $66,000.


Quinn Thompson, founder of the Lakker Capital Crypto Coverage Fund, said that it's very unlikely that Strategy will have to liquidate a large amount of Bitcoin by a guarantee margin.

The company has also avoided using its Bitcoin holdings as a guarantee for loans, with the only exception being one with Silvergate that was reimbursed in 2023.


Strategy uses three methods to capture capital: issuance of shares, convertible bonds and preferred actions.

Convertible bonds have allowed Strategy to raise funds quickly without immediately diluting shareholders, however the high volatility of these bonds has made them attractive mostly with an interest rate of 0%.

The company has also begun to use preferred actions, which offer investors stable profitability through dividends.


Jeffrey Park, director of Alpha Strategies at the Cripto Bitwise manager, said that Strategy's capital structure is almost like a risk and reward in a park.

Park added that common shareholders and convertible bond holders are on one side; the preferential shareholders, in the other. As the perception changes, the value is redistributed between these groups.


Strategy faces important obligations: paying for 8% dividends by STRK, 10% by Strf, and an interest rate of 0.4% on their convertible bonds.

Since its software business generates very little cash flow, finding funds to cover these payments could be complicated.


Thompson said that Strategy probably has to continue issuing MSTR shares to pay interest.

This will affect the price of the shares and in the worst scenario, the shares could be discounted with a discount regarding their Bitcoin holdings.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An investment firm with ties to U.S. President Donald Trump’s sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., is putting some of its excess cash into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

Dominari Holdings (DOMH), located in the Trump Tower in New York City, made headlines last month after the Trump brothers joined its 58-year-old board of advisors and became investors.

In an earnings report on Friday, it announced that it would adopt a bitcoin reserve strategy and invest a portion of its cash reserves into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest spot bitcoin ETF on the market. According to the report, Dominari has committed $2 million to buy shares of IBIT as of now.

The stock has a market cap of about $70 million and has fallen more than 9% on Friday's trading.

Most companies that adopt a bitcoin reserve strategy buy the cryptocurrency outright and self-custody it or use a custodian. Dominari is instead gaining exposure through a regulated exchange-traded fund, a move that may appeal to firms looking for easier compliance and cleaner accounting.

The move isn’t surprising, given Donald Trump Jr.’s interest in crypto.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dominari Holdings, located in the Trump Tower in New York City, made headlines last month after the Trump brothers joined their board of directors.

The company has announced that it will adopt a Bitcoin reserve strategy and invest a part of its cash reserves in Ishares Bitcoin Trust (Ibit) of Blackrock, the ETF of Bitcoin with the largest market capitalization.

Dominari has compromised $2 million to buy Ibit shares. The action has a stock market capitalization of approximately $70 million and has fallen more than 9% in Friday operations.

Most companies that adopt a Bitcoin reserve strategy buy the cryptocurrency directly and guard or resort to a custodian. Dominari, on the other hand, is gaining visibility through a regulated stock quoted (ETF) fund.

The decision is not surprising, given the interest of Donald Trump Jr. in the crypto. The president's son participates in numerous crypto projects and has become an unofficial spokesman for his father's enthusiasm.

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the financial protocol backed by President Donald Trump and his family, launched its own stable currency in a crypto event in Washington earlier this week.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. will no longer instruct banks to get prior sign-off before they engage in crypto activities — a standard that was set in 2022.

The FDIC, which is the chief federal supervisor of thousands of typically smaller banks and runs the banking industry's government backstop, had occupied a significant role in the crypto debanking saga. A courtroom fight with crypto exchange Coinbase had recently unveiled dozens of letters between the regulator and banks it supervised. In that 2022 correspondence, the FDIC had instructed them to steer clear of new crypto matters while it hashed out policies, though the agency never developed any and left bankers hanging.

The new industry guidance issued on Friday comes after President Donald Trump elevated a crypto-friendly leadership at the FDIC and other financial regulators and has directed his administration to open doors for the industry. “With today’s action, the FDIC is turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years,” said FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill, in a statement.

Banks that were once expected to get pre-approvals on crypto matters can now forge ahead, as long as they're appropriately considering the risks. The guidance to seek pre-approvals was a common stance across all three U.S. banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

The OCC also acted recently to rescind its similar 2022 guidance, which had emerged as the digital assets sector was beset by failure and high-profile fraud, and global exchange FTX was steering toward disaster.</p>
