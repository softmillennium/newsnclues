The FDIC, which is the chief federal supervisor of thousands of typically smaller banks and runs the banking industry's government backstop, had occupied a significant role in the crypto debanking saga. A courtroom fight with crypto exchange Coinbase had recently unveiled dozens of letters between the regulator and banks it supervised. In that 2022 correspondence, the FDIC had instructed them to steer clear of new crypto matters while it hashed out policies, though the agency never developed any and left bankers hanging.

The new industry guidance issued on Friday comes after President Donald Trump elevated a crypto-friendly leadership at the FDIC and other financial regulators and has directed his administration to open doors for the industry.

“With today’s action, the FDIC is turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years,” said FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill, in a statement. “I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards.”

Banks that were once expected to get pre-approvals on crypto matters can now forge ahead, as long as they're appropriately considering the risks.

Bo Hines, the White House's director of its council of digital assets advisers cheered the FDIC's move in a social media post, calling it a ""huge step forward.""

The guidance to seek pre-approvals was a common stance across all three U.S. banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The OCC also acted recently to rescind its similar 2022 guidance, which had emerged as the digital assets sector was beset by failure and high-profile fraud, and global exchange FTX was steering toward disaster.

Bitcoin (BTC), hovering just below $88,000 a day ago, tumbled to $83,800 recently and is down 3.8% over the past 24 hours. The broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index declined 5.7%, with native cryptos Avalanche (AVAX), Polygon (POL), Near (NEAR), and Uniswap (UNI) all nursing almost 10% losses during the same period. Today's sell-off wiped out $115 billion of the total market value of cryptocurrencies, TradingView data shows.

Ethereum's ether (ETH) declined over 6% to extend its downtrend against BTC, falling to its weakest relative price to the largest cryptocurrency since May 2020. Underscoring the bearish trend, spot ETH exchange-traded funds failed to attract any net inflows since early March, while their BTC counterparts saw over $1 billion of inflows in the past two weeks, according to Farside Investors data.

The ugly crypto price action coincided with U.S. stocks selling off during the day on poor economic data, with the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index down 2% and 2.8%, respectively. Crypto-focused stocks also suffered heavy losses: Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate BTC holder, closed the day 10% lower, while crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) dropped 7.7%.

The February PCE inflation report, released this morning, showed a 2.5% year-over-year increase in the price index, with core inflation at 2.8%, slightly above expectations. Consumer spending showed a modest 0.4% rise, though inflation-adjusted figures indicate minimal growth, suggesting potential headwinds for economic growth. The Federal Reserve of Atlanta's GDPNow model now projects the U.S. economy to contract 2.8% in the first quarter, 0.5% adjusted for gold imports and exports, spurring stagflationary fears.

The implementation of broad-scale U.S. tariffs next week—the so-called ""Liberation Day' on April 2, as the Trump administration refers to—also compounded investor concerns across markets.

CME gapfill or another leg lower?

Bitcoin has closely correlated with the Nasdaq lately, so U.S. equities rolling over for another leg down could weigh on the broader crypto market. However, on a more optimistic note, today's decline could be BTC filling the price gap at around $84,000-$85,000 between Monday's open and the previous week's close on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures market. Historically, BTC usually revisited similar CME gaps and a drop to $84,000 was in the cards, CoinDesk senior analyst James Van Straten noted earlier this week.

""At this stage it’s difficult to determine if we have already seen a bottom in 2025,"" Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, said in a market note. Despite the on-going correction, he noted several positive trends such as crypto-friendly policies in the U.S. and more traditional financial firms entering the industry or expanding crypto offerings, which could bode well for digital assets later in the year.

""Any additional setbacks that we might see should be exceptionally well supported into the $70-75k area,"" he added.",coindesk

Trump also pardoned Hayes’ co-founders at BitMEX, Samuel Reed and Benjamin Delo. CNBC first reported the pardons, which the White House said were signed on Thursday.

In 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) brought charges against BitMEX, its three co-founders, and its first employee, Gregory Dwyer, accusing them of violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). Prosecutors alleged BitMEX advertised itself as a place where customers could use its platform virtually anonymously, without providing basic know-your-customer (KYC) information. All four individuals eventually pleaded guilty and were sentenced to fines and probationary sentences. The exchange itself pleaded guilty to violating the BSA last year.

Hayes faced two years of probation; Delo spent 30 months on probation and Reed 18 months on probation. Dwyer got 12 months of probation.

In a statement, Delo said he and his colleagues had been ""wrongfully targeted.""

""This full and unconditional pardon by President Trump is a vindication of the position we have always held — that BitMEX, my co-founders and I should never have been charged with a criminal offense through an obscure, antiquated law,"" he said. ""As the most successful crypto exchange of its kind, we were wrongfully made to serve as an example, sacrificed for political reasons and used to send inconsistent regulatory signals. I’m sincerely grateful to the President for granting this pardon to me and my co-founders.""

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ordered BitMEX to pay $100 million for violating the Commodity Exchange Act and other CFTC regulations in 2021, separately from its DOJ settlements.

Attorneys representing Hayes, Delo and Reed did not immediately return requests for comment.

The reported pardons come just a day after Trump granted a pardon to Trevor Milton, the former CEO of Nikola Motors who was previously convicted of fraud in 2022. In January, Trump made good on long-standing promises to pardon Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht, who was 11 years into a draconian sentence of double life in prison plus 40 years, with no possibility of parole. Since Ulbricht’s pardon, former FTX CEO and convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried has been angling for his own pardon, attempting to curry favor with the Trump administration and appearing on Tucker Carlson in an unauthorized jailhouse interview that landed him in solitary confinement.

Former Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, who pleaded guilty to the same charge as Hayes and served four months in prison last year — making him not only the richest person to ever go to prison in the U.S., but also the only person to ever serve jail time for violating the BSA — has denied reports that he, too, is seeking a pardon from President Trump.

But, Zhao admitted in a recent X post that “no felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in US history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA charge.”

https://coindesk.com,Strategy (MSTR) Holders Might be at Risk From Michael Saylor's Financial Wizardry,https://coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/28/strategy-holders-might-be-at-risk-from-michael-saylor-s-financial-wizardry,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Is Strategy (MSTR) in trouble?

Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the firm formerly known as MicroStrategy has vacuumed up 506,137 bitcoin (BTC), currently worth roughly $44 billion at BTC's current price near $87,000, in the span of about five years. To the casual observer, the company seems to have a magic, unlimited pool of funds from which to draw on to buy more bitcoin. But Strategy acquired a sizable chunk of its stash by issuing billions of dollars in equity and convertible notes (debt securities which can be converted into equity under special conditions), and more recently via the issuance of preferred stock, a type of equity that provides dividends to investors.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto for Advisors Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

However, the price of bitcoin has been pushed down about 20% since peaking above $109,000 two months ago. And though such swings in prices are far from unusual, the particularly aggressive recent purchases by Saylor and team mean Strategy's average acquisition price has risen to $66,000. The company is really only one more moderate swing down in price from being in the red on its buys.

Which begs the question: Could all of Strategy’s financial wizardry end up backfiring on the company should bitcoin keep heading lower?

“It's highly unlikely that it results in a scenario where [Strategy] has to liquidate a bunch of bitcoin because it gets margin called,” Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, told CoinDesk in an interview. “For the most part, the debt is very likely to be able to be refinanced for the convertible notes. And then [the firm] started issuing this perpetual preferred stock, which never has to be repaid.”

In other words, not only is there very little chance that Strategy could suffer the kind of blowup that shook over crypto firms and projects in 2022 (like Genesis or Three Arrows Capital), but the firm has even refrained from posting its bitcoin holdings as collateral for loans — with the exception of a loan taken from Silvergate, which was repaid in 2023.

Even so, that does not necessarily mean that it’s blue skies ahead for MSTR investors, because under various scenarios, Saylor could be forced to issue more equity than the market can handle in order to maintain course.

“If he’s not paying dividends with Strategy’s cash flow, he's going to issue more shares and wreck the stock price. But it's no different than what he's doing already. Every time the retail bids it up, he wrecks the stock price by issuing more shares. In the future, he will have to do that, and the flows might not go into bitcoin. They might go to repay these debtors, and it will hurt the share price,” Thompson said.

Saylor’s balancing act

Strategy currently employs three different methods for raising capital: it can issue equity, convertible notes, or preferred stock.

Issuing equity means that Strategy creates new MSTR shares, sells them on the market, and uses the proceeds to buy bitcoin. Naturally, that creates selling pressure on MSTR and can potentially push the stock downward.

Convertible notes have allowed Strategy to raise funds quickly without diluting MSTR stock. Typically, investors like these notes because they offer a solid yield, they benefit if the stock surges, and they can usually be redeemed in cash for an amount equal to the original investment in addition to interest payments. The tremendous volatility of Strategy’s convertible notes, however, has allowed the company to mostly issue them at a zero percent interest rate and still meet high demand from sophisticated market participants, who have made bank trading that volatility.

Finally, Strategy has begun deploying preferred stocks. These are instruments that tend to appeal to investors seeking lower volatility and more predictable returns through dividends. There are currently two offerings: STRK, which gives an 8% annual return; and STRF, which pays 10% annualized.

But why is Strategy issuing all of these different types of investment vehicles? The idea is to create demand for Strategy for all kinds of investors that may have different tolerances to risk, Jeffrey Park, head of Alpha Strategies at crypto asset management Bitwise, told CoinDesk in an interview.

“The convertible bond investors and the common equity investors were generally aligned in that they were both volatility seeking structures,” Park said. “Preferred equities are different. They actually are favored by investors who want to minimize volatility at all costs for a steady, reliable and high coupon that they feel is worth the credit risk.”

“Strategy’s capital structure is almost like a seesaw in a playground,” Park added. “The common shareholders and converts are on one side, the preferred equity holders are on the other side. As sentiment shifts, the weights move around, and it tilts the value between these securities. But no matter how the seesaw moves, its total weight — which is Strategy’s enterprise value — remains the same. It’s just a redistribution of people's perceived value across the liabilities that exist on the company's balance sheet.”

Risks

Even so, Strategy now finds itself in a situation where it must pay 8% dividends on STRK, 10% dividends on STRF, and a blend of 0.4% interest rate on its convertible bonds.

With Strategy’s software business providing very little cash flow, finding the funds to pay for all of these dividends might be tricky.

The company will likely need to keep issuing MSTR stock to pay the interest it owes, Thompson said. “It will hurt the share price. In the most extreme scenario, the stock could trade at a discount [from its bitcoin holdings], because he would be having to issue shares to pay interest and cover cash flow.”

“The really draconian scenario would be for the discount to get so wide, like 20% or 30%, like Grayscale’s GBTC [prior to its conversion into an ETF], that the shareholders riot and tell him to buy back shares and close the discount,” Thompson added. “Right now, he's adding shareholder value by selling the stock at an elevated price and buying bitcoin, but in the future the reverse might be true, where the best way to add shareholder value would be to sell the bitcoin and buy the stock. But that's quite far away.”

Saylor lost controlling voting power over the company in 2024 due to the continuous issuance of MSTR stock, meaning that the scenario above could theoretically happen, especially if activist investors decided to get involved.

Another potential risk for MSTR holders is that the 2x long Strategy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) issued by T-Rex and Defiance, MSTX and MSTU, have seen weirdly persistent demand despite the stock’s drawdown. Every time investors want to gain or increase their exposure to these ETFs, the issuers have to buy twice as many MSTR shares. The popularity of these ETFs has helped create constant buying pressure for MSTR — so far, they’ve accumulated over $3 billion in MSTR exposure.

Same for MSTU. (Credit: Quinn Thompson / Bloomberg)

The problem is that the music might stop someday. And if these ETFs begin to sell off their MSTR shares, the reaction on the stock price could be violent.

“I don't know where the endless capital comes from to buy the dip. These ETFs have gotten obliterated. They're down huge,” Thompson said. “I mean, this is not a structural move up in the demand curve that you should count on. It’s not something you should really bake into your 10-year predictions of bitcoin price, but as long as it's existing, it's important for bitcoin. So I'm continually amazed by it.”

But less speculative assets showed plenty of volume. Stablecoins, in particular, were the name of the game this week.



The U.S. House introduced a stablecoin bill, following up on the Senate version that was approved by committee last week. Jesse Hamilton reported. Wyoming (aka “The Blockchain State”) wants its own stablecoin and it’s testing the idea on Avalanche, Solana and Ethereum, Kris Sandor reported.

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the financial protocol backed by Donald Trump and his family, confirmed the launch of its stablecoin (USD1) this week. And Don Trump Jr. trumpeted the news at the DC Blockchain Summit.

Meanwhile, Fidelity Investment, an early TradFi innovator in crypto, is in the advanced stages of launching its own stablecoin. The venture is part of a strategy to enter the tokenized bond market, Jamie Crawley reported.



Meanwhile, Circle, the issuer of the second biggest stablecoin (USDC), has finally secured a license to operate in Japan in partnership with local heavyweight SBI Holdings, Sam Reynolds reported.

In news from our Europe team, Ian Allison had a scoop about Sam Altman's World Network holding talks with Visa on linking on-chain card features to a self-custody crypto wallet.

Will Canny heard from a source that Sam Hill, Zodia Custody's COO had left and was returning to a role in TradFi. He was able to persuade the Standard Chartered-backed company to confirm the move and we beat the competition with the story.

Canny followed up the next day with a story, unreported elsewhere, on the wave of senior staff losses at crypto prime broker FalconX. (BlackRock, by contrast, was adding talent to its digital assets team in the U.S.)

We continued to report on Strategy (MicroStrategy), pioneer of the corporate bitcoin treasury. Christine Lee had a two-hour interview with executive chairman Michael Saylor, where he mused about bitcoin as a $200 trillion asset and promised to burn bitcoin in the name of immortality.

Strategy has invested about $33 billion in bitcoin so far through various stock offerings, both common and preferred. And James Van Straten explained the differences between the company's fund-raising instruments for bitcoin purchases. Tom Carreras followed up later with a nice piece showing how MSTR stockholders might be at risk from Saylor’s buy-every-bitcoin strategy.

Meanwhile, the SEC continued to drop enforcement actions against crypto companies (Immutable was the latest, as Cheyenne Ligon reported). But, strangely, one involving Unicoin stayed open, much to the CEO’s chagrin.

In an earnings report on Friday, it announced that it would adopt a bitcoin reserve strategy and invest a portion of its cash reserves into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest spot bitcoin ETF on the market.

According to the report, Dominari has committed $2 million to buy shares of IBIT as of now. The stock has a market cap of about $70 million and has fallen more than 9% on Friday's trading.

Most companies that adopt a bitcoin reserve strategy buy the cryptocurrency outright and self-custody it or use a custodian. Dominari is instead gaining exposure through a regulated exchange-traded fund, a move that may appeal to firms looking for easier compliance and cleaner accounting.

The move isn’t surprising, given Donald Trump Jr.’s interest in crypto. The president’s son is involved in many crypto projects and has become an unofficial spokesperson for his father’s enthusiasm.

Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets at the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told CoinDesk in an interview that the ""impending gateway regime"" that is earmarked for 2026 will in fact be a new authorization regime for crypto companies.

""We will have a gateway which will allow authorization. But obviously we've got to go through those consultations, create those rules and get the legislation for that to take place,"" Long said.

This regime will be a leap from the current anti-money laundering (AML) one. Firms like crypto exchanges Coinbase, Gemini and Bitpanda will move away from just needing to register with the country to comply with anti-money laundering rules to an authorization regime with rules for a suite of offerings. This will require them to go through a fresh process to secure approval from the FCA.

The FCA intends to release papers on stablecoins, trading platforms, staking, prudential crypto exposure and more this year. The regime is expected to go live after final policy papers are published in 2026, Long said.

Since its anti-money laundering register for firms opened in 2020, the FCA received 368 applications from firms wishing to comply, but only 50 firms — 14% of applicants — have been approved so far. Many firms may have to start again.

Regulated activities

Upcoming legislation will define what counts as a regulated activity, the FCA's Long said. Companies that engage in those activities will need to seek authorization.

In 2023 the former U.K. government released papers that said regulated activities would likely include crypto and fiat-referenced stablecoins issuance as well as payment, exchange and lending activities.

Stablecoins will no longer be brought under the U.K. payments regulations as set out in previous work, former Economic Secretary Tulip Siddiq said in November. The FCA plans to consult on draft rules for stablecoins early this year.

""What we're doing in terms of the stablecoins is we're making sure that we take the best from the current regulation that exists in TradFi, but stablecoins are ultimately unique,"" Long said. ""There isn't anything that is exactly the same. We've got to adapt the regulation that we've currently got.""

Transition

The FCA is still deciding on the process crypto companies will need to go through to get authorized, Long said.

Long added that it was undecided what steps those who are already registered in the money laundering regime will need to take but the new regime will come with wider permissions,"" so we'd expect that if you wanted the further permissions, you'd apply for them.""

Therefore companies may need to go through a lengthy registration process — even if they've already secured an existing license.

""We'll be communicating with firms about what the gateway will look like before it goes live, our intention is to bring it live as soon as humanly possible,"" Long said referring to the authorization regime.

In formulating how it intends to move forward, the regulator plans to also look at Europe which has launched bespoke legislation for the crypto sector and the International Organization of Securities Commissions' 18 recommendations. IOSCO will soon be publishing a piece on how countries are progressing with its standards, someone familiar with the matter said.

""It's a case of understanding and looking for best practice,"" Long said.

The cloud computing firm had sold roughly 37.5 million shares at $40 each, raising about $1.5 billion for its initial public offering (IPO), making it the largest tech offering since 2021. It had, however, initially planned to file the offering at $47 to $55 a share at a much higher valuation than it ultimately saw.

Nvidia, an early investor in the company, placed a $250 million order in the offering.

Some experts speculated that the stock’s debut wouldn’t see the success it had hoped for. Bloomberg Opinion US technology columnist Dave Lee, for example, pointed out the company’s large debt, reliance on just a few big customers and lack of diversity in revenue may be an issue.

“CoreWeave stands to be a bellwether for the AI industry as a whole — a must-watch stock as questions about return on investment grow ever louder,” Lee wrote in an op-ed on Friday. “Even the slightest indication of shakiness in the belief of AI sends investors into a tailspin.”

The current risk-off environment caused by the overall macro situation in the U.S., mainly due to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which has caused a sell off in tech stocks, could also have weighed on CoreWeave’s IPO.

An ongoing convergence between traditional card networks and the on-chain world of stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) has seen Mastercard partner with Web3 wallet MetaMask, and more recently reports of Visa in talks with Sam Altman’s World Network.

The rewards wallet offering helps bridge the gap between blockchain and everyday financial needs, said Baanx Chief Commercial Officer Simon Jones.

“We've built the Rewards Wallet using Circle to offer rewards on a crypto debit card that are unprecedented, and so incentivizing users to go down the route of non-custodial spend,” Jones said in an interview. “For instance, if you look at the MataMask card, it’s up to 6% cash-back for the first month.”

Circle, famous as the creator of the $60 billion stablecoin USDC, offers programmable wallet infrastructure that allows for adding features to multiple crypto projects without having to change the user interface, Jones said.

“We are pushing USDC as the main treasury token and incentive program within these products, as opposed to Tether [USDT],” he said.

Led by executive president Michael Saylor, the company previously known as Microstrategy has accumulated 506,137 Bitcoin (BTC), with an current value of approximately US $ 44,000 million at the current BTC price, close to US $ 87,000, in a period of approximately five years. For the casual observer, the company seems to have a magical and inexhaustible reserve of funds to continue buying Bitcoin. However, Strategy acquired a considerable part of his reservations by issuing billions of dollars in shares, convertible bonds (debt titles that can become capital into certain conditions) and, more recently, preferred shares, a type of capital that offers investors dividends.

Continue below, don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto Long & Short Bulletin today. Seeing all bulletins inscribe me when registering, you will receive emails about Coindesk products and accept our conditions of use and privacy policy.

However, the price of Bitcoin has fallen approximately 20% since it reached its maximum of US $ 109,000 two months ago. And although these fluctuations are not unusual, the recent particularly aggressive purchases of Saylor and his team have raised the average acquisition price of Strategy to US $ 66,000. Actually, the company has only suffered a slight price drop since it registered losses in its purchases.

What the question raises: could all Strategy financial magic come back against him if the price of Bitcoin continues to fall?

""It is very unlikely that this will lead to [Strategy] having to liquidate a large amount of Bitcoin by a guarantee margin,"" said Quinn Thompson, founder of the Lakker Capital Crypto Coverage Fund, in an interview with COINDESK. ""In general, it is very likely that the debt can be refinant in the convertible bonds. And then [the company] began to issue perpetual preferential actions, which never have to refund.""

In other words, it is not only unlikely that Strategy suffers an implosion such as other companies crypto in 2022 (such as Genesis or Three Arrows Capital), but the company has also avoided using its Bitcoin holdings as a guarantee for loans, with the only exception of one with silvergate that was reimbursed in 2023.

Even so, that does not mean that the future is promising for Mstr investors. In various scenarios, Saylor could be forced to issue more actions than the market can absorb to maintain its strategy.

""If you do not pay dividends with Strategy cash flow, it will issue more actions and make the price fall. But this is no different from what you have already done. Every time the retail sector raises the bids, it emits more actions and collapses the price. In the future, it will have to do it, and it is possible that these flows do not go to Bitcoin. They could go to pay the creditors, which would harm the price of the price of Actions, ""said Thompson.

Saylor's equilibrium act

Currently, Strategy uses three methods to capture capital: issuance of shares, convertible bonds and preferred actions.

Issue actions implies creating new Mstr shares, selling them on the market and using income to buy Bitcoin. Naturally, this generates bearish pressure on the price of Mstr.

Convertible bonds have allowed Strategy to raise funds quickly without immediately diluting shareholders. These instruments are usually attractive to investors because they combine performance, possibility of conversion into shares if they rise, and protection of invested capital. However, the high volatility of these bonds has allowed Strategy to broadcast them mostly with an interest rate of 0% and still there has been high demand by sophisticated market participants.

Finally, Strategy has begun to use preferred, attractive actions for investors seeking less volatility and stable profitability through dividends. There are currently two options: Strk, with an annual return of 8%, and Strf, which pays 10%.

The reason for so much variety? ""The idea is to generate demand for all types of investors with different risk tolerances,"" said Jeffrey Park, director of Alpha Strategies at the Cripto Bitwise manager. ""Investors in convertible bonds and common actions generally accept more volatile structures. Preferred actions are different: they are designed for those who want to avoid volatility and obtain stable and reliable coupons, which justify the credit risk.""

""Strategy's capital structure is almost like a rise and low in a park,"" Park added. ""Common shareholders and convertible bond holders are on one side; the preferential shareholders, in the other. As the perception changes, the value is redistributed between these groups. But the total value - that is, the business value of Strategy - remains the same. It only moves the perception of value between the liabilities in its balance.""

Risks

Even so, Strategy faces important obligations: he must pay for 8% dividends by STRK, 10% by Strf, and an interest rate of 0.4% on their convertible bonds.

Since its software business generates very little cash flow, finding funds to cover these payments could be complicated.

""You probably have to continue issuing MSTR shares to pay interest,"" said Thompson. ""This will affect the price of the shares. In the worst scenario, the shares could be discounted with a discount regarding their Bitcoin holdings, since it would have to issue actions to pay interest and cover the cash flow.""

""The most extreme scenario would be that this discount is extended to 20% or 30%, as happened with GBTC of Grayscale before becoming ETF,"" he added. ""Shareholders could demand to repurchase actions to close the discount. It is now generating value selling expensive actions to buy Bitcoin. But in the future, it could be the other way around: generating value selling Bitcoin to repurchase actions. Even so, that is far for now.""

Saylor lost voting control over the company in 2024 due to the continuous issuance of Mstr shares, which means that this scenario could happen theoretically, especially if activist investors come into play.

Another risk for MSTR holders is that the ETFs leverage of T-Rex and Defiance (MSTX and MSTU), which replicate the performance of MSTR with long double exposure, have shown a persistent demand despite the fall of the actions. Every time these ETFs receive investments, they must buy twice as much mstr shares, which has generated a constant buying pressure. To date, they have more than US $ 3 billion in exposure to MSTR.

The problem is that this music could stop sounding. And if these ETFs begin to liquidate, the MSTR price reaction could be violent.

""I don't know where inexhaustible capital comes from buying every time it falls,"" said Thompson. ""These ETFs have been destroyed. They have lowered a lot. It is not a structural trend up to the demand with which it can be counted. It is not something that must be included in the 10 -year projections of the price of Bitcoin. But as long as it exists, it is important for Bitcoin. I still surprise me.""

Jordan Pace reintroduced Bill H. 4256, The “Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Act Of South Carolina”, into South Carolina’s House of Representatives.

Highlights from the bill include the fact that it enables the State Treasurer to invest up to 10% of the funds under the state’s management into digital assets, including bitcoin, and that the state’s Strategic Digital Assets Reserve can include up to one million bitcoin.

The bill also states that the reason for establishing such a reserve is because “inflation has eroded the purchasing power of assets held in state funds” and that “bitcoin, a decentralized digital asset, and other digital assets offer unique properties that can act as a hedge against inflation and economic volatility.”

The bill does not stipulate whether or not state officials should hold the private keys to the bitcoin and other digital assets that it accumulates for the reserve, though it enables the State Treasurer to develop policies and protocols to protect the assets held in the reserve, including the use of cold storage or the contracting of a third party to maintain custody of the assets. The State Treasurer can also utilize a third party to assist in the creation, maintenance, and administration of the reserve’s security.

As per the bill, the State Treasurer would be responsible for preparing a biennial report that includes the total amount of digital assets held in the reserve, the U.S. dollar value of those assets, and transactions and expenditures related to the reserve since the previous report. Also, the State Treasurer would be required to publish proof of reserves, which includes the public addresses of the digital assets held in the reserve on an official state website, enabling citizens to independently audit and verify the reserve’s holdings.

Finally, the bill stipulates that the Strategic Digital Asset Reserve undergo audits that include an examination of the quality of the security of custody solutions; an assessment of compliance with local, state and federal laws; and an evaluation of internal controls to mitigate against cyberattacks and mismanagement.

This reverses a controversial policy imposed under the Biden administration.

In a March 28 statement, the FDIC said banks can now participate in crypto-related services like custody and trading if they properly manage the risks. The agency will also work to replace old regulations with updated crypto guidance.

The policy change came in a new Financial Institution Letter that rescinds earlier rules from 2022 requiring banks to get FDIC clearance before handling bitcoin and crypto assets. That red tape frustrated the banking industry.

By removing this barrier, the FDIC enables its supervised banks to experiment with this emerging ecosystem more freely. However, specific permissions will still depend on interagency coordination.

Acting FDIC Chairman Travis Hill called the move “one of several steps” in laying out a new crypto-friendly approach focused on security. He said, “The FDIC is turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years.” The agency expects to release additional guidance as it consults the President’s Working Group on digital assets.

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,Is Bitcoin’s Bull Market Truly Back?,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/is-bitcoins-bull-market-truly-back,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 08:38:05 GMT","Following a sharp multi-week selloff that dragged Bitcoin from above $100,000 to below $80,000, the recent price bounce has traders debating whether the Bitcoin bull market is truly back on track or if this is merely a bear market rally before the next macro leg higher.

Bitcoin’s Local Bottom or Bull Market Pause?

Bitcoin’s latest correction was deep enough to rattle confidence, but shallow enough to maintain macro trend structure. Price seems to have set a local bottom between $76K–$77K, and several reliable metrics are beginning to solidify the local lows and point towards further upside.

The Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) is one of the most reliable sentiment gauges across Bitcoin cycles. As price fell, NUPL dropped into “Anxiety” territory, but following the rebound, NUPL has now reclaimed the “Belief” zone, a critical sentiment transition historically seen at macro higher lows.

The Value Days Destroyed (VDD) Multiple weighs BTC spending by both coin age and transaction size, and compares the data to a previous yearly average, giving insight into long term holder behavior. Current readings have reset to low levels, suggesting that large, aged coins are not being moved. This is a clear signal of conviction from smart money. Similar dynamics preceded major price rallies in both the 2016/17 and 2020/21 bull cycles.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Boost Bull Market

We’re also now seeing the Long Term Holder Supply beginning to climb. After profit-taking above $100K, long-term participants are now re-accumulating at lower levels. Historically, these phases of accumulation have set the foundation for supply squeezes and subsequent parabolic price action.

Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Signal Bull Market Cross

The Hash Ribbons Indicator has just completed a bullish crossover, where the short-term hash rate trend moves above the longer-term average. This signal has historically aligned with bottoms and trend reversals. Given that miner behavior tends to reflect profitability expectations, this cross suggests miners are now confident in higher prices ahead.

Bitcoin Bull Market Tied to Stocks

Despite bullish on-chain data, Bitcoin remains closely tied to macro liquidity trends and equity markets, particularly the S&P 500. As long as that correlation holds, BTC will be partially at the mercy of global monetary policy, risk sentiment, and liquidity flows. While rate cut expectations have helped risk assets bounce, any sharp reversal could cause renewed choppiness for Bitcoin.

Figure 5: BTC remains highly correlated to US Equities. View Live Chart

Bitcoin Bull Market Outlook

From a data-driven perspective, Bitcoin looks increasingly well-positioned for a sustained continuation of its bull cycle. On-chain metrics paint a compelling picture of resilience for the Bitcoin bull market. The Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) has shifted from “Anxiety” during the dip to the “Belief” zone after the rebound—a transition often seen at macro higher lows. Similarly, the Value Days Destroyed (VDD) Multiple has reset to levels signaling conviction among long-term holders, echoing patterns before Bitcoin’s rallies in 2016/17 and 2020/21. These metrics point to structural strength, bolstered by long-term holders aggressively accumulating supply below $80,000.

Further supporting this, the Hash Ribbons indicator’s recent bullish crossover reflects growing miner confidence in Bitcoin’s profitability, a reliable sign of trend reversals historically. This accumulation phase suggests the Bitcoin bull market may be gearing up for a supply squeeze, a dynamic that has fueled parabolic moves before. The data collectively highlights resilience, not weakness, as long-term holders seize the dip as an opportunity. Yet, this strength hinges on more than just on-chain signals—external factors will play a critical role in what comes next.

However, macro conditions still warrant caution, as the Bitcoin bull market doesn’t operate in isolation. Bull markets take time to build momentum, often needing steady accumulation and favorable conditions to ignite the next leg higher. While the local bottom between $76K–$77K seems to hold, the path forward won’t likely feature vertical candles of peak euphoria yet. Bitcoin’s tie to the S&P 500 and global liquidity trends means volatility could emerge from shifts in monetary policy or risk sentiment.

For example, while rate cut expectations have lifted risk assets, an abrupt reversal—perhaps from inflation spikes or geopolitical shocks—could test Bitcoin’s stability. Thus, even with on-chain data signaling a robust setup, the next phase of the Bitcoin bull market will likely unfold in measured steps. Traders anticipating a return to six-figure prices will need patience as the market builds its foundation.

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,How to Measure the Success of a Bitcoin Treasury Company,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/bitcoin-for-corporations/how-to-measure-the-success-of-a-bitcoin-treasury-company,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 06:29:23 GMT","In the world of traditional finance, evaluating a company’s success usually means tracking revenue growth, earnings per share, or return on equity. But what happens when the core of a company’s strategy isn’t selling products or services, but accumulating Bitcoin?

That’s the question facing a new class of Bitcoin treasury companies. These are publicly traded firms whose central mission is to acquire and hold Bitcoin over the long term. And to understand whether they’re succeeding, we need a fresh set of tools.

This article introduces those tools—new key performance indicators (KPIs) designed to evaluate how well a company is executing its Bitcoin strategy. Many of these indicators have been pioneered by Michael Saylor and his company, Strategy, where they can be seen implemented on their new dashboard. These new metrics may sound complex at first, but once broken down, they offer powerful insight into whether a Bitcoin treasury company is truly delivering for its shareholders.

1. BTC Yield: Measuring Accretion, Not Earnings

What it is: BTC Yield tracks the percentage change over time in the ratio between a company’s Bitcoin holdings and its fully diluted share count. In simple terms: how much more Bitcoin is owned per potential share of stock.

Why it matters: This KPI is designed to answer a unique question: Is the company acquiring Bitcoin in a way that benefits shareholders?

Let’s say a company holds 10,000 BTC and has 100 million diluted shares. That’s 0.1 BTC per share. If, a year later, it holds 12,000 BTC and has 105 million shares, it now holds ~0.114 BTC per share—a 14% increase. That 14% is your BTC Yield.

What makes it unique: BTC Yield doesn’t care about profit margins or EBITDA. It’s focused on how effectively the company is increasing Bitcoin ownership relative to the number of shares that could exist. This is key in a strategy that involves using equity to buy BTC. If management is printing new shares to buy Bitcoin, shareholders want to know: is the Bitcoin per share going up or down?

How to use it: Investors can track BTC Yield over time to see if dilution (more shares) is being offset by accretive Bitcoin purchases (more BTC). A consistently rising BTC Yield suggests management is executing well.

2. BTC Gain: The Bitcoin-Based Growth Metric

What it is: BTC Gain takes the BTC Yield and applies it to the company’s starting Bitcoin balance for a period. It tells you how many theoretical “extra” bitcoins the company effectively added through accretive behavior.

Why it matters: This is a way of visualizing BTC Yield not as a percentage, but as Bitcoin itself. If BTC Yield for the quarter is 5% and the company started with 10,000 BTC, BTC Gain is 500 BTC.

What makes it unique: It helps you think in Bitcoin terms, which aligns with the company’s long-term goal. Shareholders aren’t just watching for more BTC—they want more BTC per share. BTC Gain helps quantify how much more BTC the company would’ve had if it started from scratch and grew holdings accretively.

How to use it: BTC Gain is especially helpful when comparing different time periods. If one quarter shows 200 BTC Gain and the next shows 800 BTC Gain, you know the company’s Bitcoin strategy had a much stronger impact in the second period—even if the BTC price stayed flat.

3. BTC $ Gain: Bringing Bitcoin Gains Into Dollar Terms

What it is: BTC $ Gain translates BTC Gain into U.S. dollars by multiplying it by the price of Bitcoin at the end of the period.

Why it matters: Investors still live in a world dominated by fiat. Converting Bitcoin-based growth into dollar terms helps bridge the communication gap between Bitcoin-native strategy and traditional shareholder expectations.

What makes it unique: This metric offers a hybrid lens—Bitcoin-denominated growth, viewed in fiat terms. But here’s the catch: BTC $ Gain can show a positive number even if the actual value of the company’s holdings dropped (because the metric is based on share-adjusted accumulation, not fair market value accounting).

How to use it: Use this metric to contextualize how much value (in dollars) the company’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy may have created over a period—just remember that it’s not a profit measure. It’s a reflection of growth in stake, not accounting gain or loss.

4. Bitcoin NAV: A Snapshot of Raw Bitcoin Holdings

What it is: Bitcoin NAV (Net Asset Value) is the market value of the company’s Bitcoin holdings. It’s calculated simply: Bitcoin Price × Bitcoin Count.

Why it matters: It gives a snapshot of the company’s Bitcoin “war chest,” plain and simple.

What makes it unique: Unlike traditional NAV used in mutual funds or ETFs, this version ignores liabilities like debt or preferred stock. It’s not meant to tell you what shareholders would get in a liquidation. Instead, it’s just: How much Bitcoin does the company own, and what is it worth right now?

How to use it: Use Bitcoin NAV to understand the scale of the company’s Bitcoin strategy. A rising NAV could reflect more Bitcoin, higher prices, or both. But remember: it’s not adjusted for debt or financial obligations, so it’s not a full picture of shareholder value.

5. BTC Rating: The Leverage Check You Don’t Have to Guess About

What it is: BTC Rating is a simple ratio: the market value of the company’s Bitcoin divided by its total financial obligations. It shows how much of the company’s debt and liabilities could be covered by its Bitcoin holdings.

Why it matters: This metric gives a Bitcoin-native snapshot of balance sheet strength. It helps investors quickly gauge whether a company’s Bitcoin strategy is supported by a sound capital structure—or weighed down by obligations.

What makes it unique: Unlike traditional credit ratings that rely on opaque models and institutional trust, BTC Rating is transparent and verifiable. The inputs—Bitcoin holdings and liabilities—are public. It puts solvency into plain sight, without needing anyone’s permission or opinion.

How to use it: A BTC Rating above 1.0 suggests the company’s Bitcoin position outweighs its obligations—a strong indicator of strategic flexibility and solvency. A rating below 1.0 may signal over-leverage or exposure to refinancing risk. Watching how this ratio evolves over time gives investors a powerful lens for evaluating whether the company’s Bitcoin-first strategy is being executed responsibly.

Why These Metrics Matter Together

Each KPI gives a different lens:

BTC Yield shows shareholder-accretive growth.

shows shareholder-accretive growth. BTC Gain translates that into BTC terms.

translates that into BTC terms. BTC $ Gain puts it in dollars.

puts it in dollars. Bitcoin NAV shows raw Bitcoin value.

shows raw Bitcoin value. BTC Rating tests how that value stacks up against liabilities.

Used together, they give investors a comprehensive picture of whether a Bitcoin treasury company is:

Growing its stake effectively

Protecting or enhancing shareholder value

Managing risk appropriately

One Final Note: These Metrics Aren’t Perfect

These KPIs are not traditional financial metrics, and they aren’t meant to be. They ignore things like operating revenue, cash flow, or even debt service costs. They also assume that convertible debt will convert, not mature.

In other words, they’re tools designed to isolate the Bitcoin strategy, not the whole business. That’s why they should be used alongside a company’s financial statements—not as a substitute.

But for investors trying to understand whether a company is making smart moves in the Bitcoin arena, these metrics offer something traditional tools can’t: clarity on whether management is using equity and capital in a way that actually grows Bitcoin per share.

And in a Bitcoin-first world, that just might be the most important metric of all.

Dubai, UAE, March 28th, 2025, Chainwire

Crypto exchange Coincall has officially entered the Top 5 global crypto options exchanges by trading volume, marking a major milestone just 18 months after its founding. The achievement highlights the platform’s rapid growth in a sector that’s increasingly drawing both institutional and retail interest.

The surge in performance, according to internal data and third-party analytics, is linked to a successful Q1 strategy that included high-impact marketing campaigns and new product rollouts, in collaboration with notable crypto partners such as SignalPlus, DWF, and Big Candle Capital.

Crypto Options: From Niche Strategy to Core Market Structure

Once reserved for quants and hedge funds, options are now becoming a go-to instrument for crypto-native investors. These contracts give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell assets at a set price — enabling sophisticated hedging, volatility plays, and directional speculation.

As the broader digital asset market matures, crypto options are increasingly viewed as a critical building block of the financial stack. That narrative hit the mainstream this month when reports emerged of Coinbase being in advanced talks to acquire Deribit, the market’s dominant BTC and ETH options venue, for a rumored $4–5 billion. Although negotiations have since tapered, the message from the market is clear: crypto derivatives are no longer a sideshow — they’re center stage.

Youngest in the Top 5 — and Fastest Rising

Coincall’s breakout is notable not just for its velocity, but for the company’s relative youth. Founded in late 2023, Coincall now ranks among the top exchanges in the space, with it currently 9-10% the size of Deribit.

According to data from Laevitas, Coincall captured an average market share of 5.43% between March 8 and 17, 2025, with a notable peak at 10.15% on March 15. The exchange also saw strong volume days with 9.78% share on March 8 and 6.64% on March 16 — signaling rising momentum and growing competitiveness in the global crypto options landscape.

Coincall’s comparative market share and growth trajectory make it the youngest exchange ever to break into the Top 5, and potentially one of the most viable candidates for acquisition or institutional partnership among rising players. As attention shifts from mature giants to agile challengers, Coincall has positioned itself at the center of that conversation, growing into almost the same market share as industry giant ByBit.

Leadership Backed by Vision

In January, Coincall appointed Daryl Teo — former strategist at Alibaba Group (NASDAQ: BABA) and a long-time investor in the crypto space — as Chief Operating Officer and minority shareholder. He joins CEO Jimmy’s team of executives previously from OKX, Paradigm and Bytedance.

“We’re witnessing crypto achieve consensus-level legitimacy as a store of value,” Teo said. “Options are the next wave — they provide leverage, flexibility, and strategy. Our mission at Coincall is simple: make investing quick, intuitive, and safe — for everyone.”

“Earn While You Trade” feature: Unlocking Yield + Capital Efficiency

Coincall’s latest innovation, Earn While You Trade (EWYT), is designed to eliminate the traditional tradeoff between yield farming and active trading.

With EWYT, users can:

Earn up to 6.4% APR on USDT holdings

on USDT holdings Access 90% of staked funds as trading margin

Withdraw funds at any time — no lock-ups

Increased capital efficiency for active traders

The feature enables users to earn yield on idle capital without forgoing trading activity, offering an alternative approach to capital utilization.

Users can explore the product here.

Macro Momentum: Crypto Infrastructure Is Back

Coincall’s rise reflects broader tailwinds in crypto infrastructure. According to PitchBook, $11.5 billion in venture capital was invested into crypto and blockchain startups in 2024 across 2,153 deals — a strong rebound after the prior bear cycle.

“The next phase of crypto will be defined by real infrastructure,” said Teo. “The platforms building with intention, with capital efficiency and user accessibility in mind, will shape the decade ahead.”

About Coincall

Coincall is a next-generation cryptocurrency options exchange founded in 2023, focused on accessibility, capital efficiency, and a seamless trading experience. With deep liquidity, fast execution, and innovative features like Earn While You Trade, Coincall is building the future of digital asset derivatives.

https://cryptobriefing.com,Nation Token ($NATO) officially launches following historic airdrop to 1 million users on Base,https://cryptobriefing.com/nation-token-nato-officially-launches-following-historic-airdrop-to-1-million-users-on-base/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 15:03:55 GMT","Share this article

Iași, Romania, March 28th, 2025, Chainwire

74% of $NATO’s 1 trillion token supply was distributed in one of the largest airdrops ever — now trading live on Uniswap, AscendEX, and Poloniex

The Nation Token ($NATO), a decentralized token on the Base blockchain, has announced its official launch following a historic airdrop to one million active Base wallets. As of today, $NATO is trading live on Uniswap, Poloniex, and AscendEX.

In December 2024, 74% of the total 1 trillion $NATO supply — 740 billion tokens — was airdropped evenly to 1 million randomly selected Base wallets, with each wallet receiving 740,000 $NATO. This marks one of the largest and most distributed token airdrops in blockchain history. Uniswap liquidity has been locked until January 1, 2030, reinforcing the commitment to long-term decentralization. The contract address for $NATO on Base is: 0xd968196fa6977c4e58f2af5ac01c655ea8332d22

Why the Nation Token Was Created

$NATO was born out of a growing concern with the direction of many modern cryptocurrencies — specifically, the increasing trend toward centralization. From token allocations to liquidity control and governance influence, too many projects are dominated by a small group of insiders, leaving everyday holders with little to no say.

The Nation Token aims to break that pattern by creating a truly community-owned and community-governed asset, where every decision and milestone is driven by the people, aligning of its mantra of #PowerToThePeople. A governance platform is currently in final development to enable token holders to vote on proposals and roadmap decisions — completing one of the final pillars of $NATO’s decentralization framework.

Speaking about the recent listings of $NATO, Andrei Popescu, CMO said “This is a true experiment in decentralized financial empowerment, proving that the power of the people can shape the market like never before. Our goal is simple yet ground-breaking—to make $NATO the first token in history to reach high goals purely through collective effort.”

Momentum and Growth

Following its initial Uniswap listing (paired with WETH), $NATO saw growth in trading activity. In the two weeks following, both Poloniex and AscendEX listed $NATO (paired with USDT), resulting in a 10x increase in trading volume according to the team. Additional exchange listings are already in the pipeline.

To drive further awareness and participation, the team has launched a community growth campaign at https://taskon.xyz/TheNationToken

Participants can compete for a $1,000 USDC monthly prize pool, split among the top 50 leaderboard members, based on engagement and learning activities around the project. This gives a further incentive for both airdrop recipients, as well as new token holders to retain their tokens.

For more information about The Nation Token and its mission, users can visit https://thenationtoken.com, or follow the project on X at https://x.com/NatoTok3n or join the citizens on Telegram at https://t.me/TheNationToken

About $NATO – The Nation Token

The Nation Token is a decentralized community-owned token built on Base, that resulted from one of the biggest airdrops in the chain’s history, as 1 million wallets received a share of 740 billion tokens. The project focuses on fair distribution, transparency, and long-term community governance.

South Carolina legislators on Thursday presented the ""Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Law"", a bill that would allow the state treasurer to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptoactives to specific limits.

The bill, also known as H4256, allows the state treasurer to invest unbelicing funds from the General Fund, Budget Stabilization Fund and other investment funds managed by the State in cryptoactive.

The investment would be limited to 10% of the total funds under management, with a maximum bitcoin reserve limit of one million bitcoins.

According to the proposed legislation, cryptoactive ones must be maintained directly by the state treasurer through a secure custody solution, by a qualified custodian, or in products negotiated in the stock market issued by regulated financial institutions. The project prohibits the cryptoactive loan.

«Bitcoin, such as a decentralized cryptoactive, and other cryptoactives offer unique properties that can act as protection against inflation and economic volatility. It also helps diversify state funds, ”says the bill.

The legislation requires a biennial report of cryptoactive holdings and their value in US dollars.

For greater transparency, the public directions of all cryptoactives must be published on an official state website. The state treasurer must also implement regular tests and audits of cryptoactive management processes.

The bill allows residents of South Carolina to make cryptoactive donations to the reservation through an approved suppliers process. If promulgated, the legislation would remain in force until September 1, 2035.

With this movement, South Carolina joins a growing list of US states that explore the establishment of crypto strategic reserves. Currently, 24 of the 50 US states have introduced Bitcoin reserve law, according to Bitcoin Law.

Before H4256, South Carolina legislators introduced S0163, a bill focused on digital asset regulation. This project seeks to prevent government agencies from accepting or require payments in digital currency of the Central Bank (CBDC).

It would also allow the use of cryptoactive for transactions without specific cryptocurrency mining taxes or zoning limitations.

In addition, S0163 addressed concerns of cryptocurrency mining such as energy and noise, while also seeking to promote rural development through mining activities.

https://decrypt.co,Hawk Tuah Girl Says SEC Dropping Probe Into Solana Meme Coin: TMZ,https://decrypt.co/312190/hawk-tuah-girl-sec-dropping-probe-into-meme-coin-tmz,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 21:19:15 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Haliey Welch, better known online as the girl behind “Hawk Tuah,” isn’t worried about the Securities and Exchange Commission’s probe into her meme coin anymore after the agency dropped the investigation, she said Friday.

“For the past few months, I've been cooperating with all the authorities and attorneys, and finally, that work is complete,” she told TMZ.

Welch launched a meme coin on Solana in December that quickly imploded, sparking backlash and forcing her to temporarily take her account offline. The Tennessee native’s meme coin HAWK rocketed to a market cap of $490 million before collapsing 93% in value within minutes.

While the public knew Welch was cooperating with a civil lawsuit against HAWK’s creators, it was not previously known that Welch faced an investigation from Wall Street’s top cop.

Welch’s lawyer told TMZ that the SEC closed its probe “without making any findings against, or seeking any monetary sanctions,” a decision allowing her to do as she pleases concerning cryptocurrencies and securities.

HAWK’s collapse raised concerns over the accountability that meme coin promoters, and those that launch them, face. Last month, the SEC advised that it doesn’t generally view meme coins as securities, and they don’t fall under its regulatory remit.

The SEC told Decrypt that the agency does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.

A spokesperson for Welch did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.

Meme coins are cryptocurrencies that typically trade on marketing and hype. Welch was among several names that dropped one last year, including Caitlyn Jenner, Jason Derulo, and Cardi B.

The civil lawsuit against HAWK’s creators does not name Welch. Instead, it’s taking action against the crypto launchpad overHERE, its founder Clinton So, an influencer named Alex Larson Schultz who goes by “Doc Hollywood,” and the so-called Tuah the Moon Foundation.

In a now-deleted interview, Welch told Richard “FaZe Banks” Bengtson that she regrets how her crypto endeavors played out. During the chat, she indicated that her knowledge of crypto was pretty surface-level, and she didn’t really know what she was getting into.

The price of HAWK jumped on Friday, recently rising 25% on the decentralized exchange, or DEX, Meteora, according to the crypto data provider GeckoTerminal. With a market cap of $4 million, the meme coin has generated $333,000 worth of trading volume over the past day.

Still, TMZ reported that Welch never plans on promoting her failed cryptocurrency again. These days, she’s slated to be profiled in an upcoming documentary.

https://decrypt.co,Nintendo Switch 2 Preview: Everything You Need to Know,https://decrypt.co/197793/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-leaks-latest-news,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 20:47:38 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

The Switch is Nintendo’s best-selling home console of all time, and widely beloved for its rich library of games—a dramatic turn from the middling Wii U before it. But it’s been eight years since the Switch launched, and fans are getting antsy for Nintendo’s next big thing.

Luckily, it's coming. Following years of leaks and rumors, and even a couple official acknowledgments that the next-gen model was coming, Nintendo formally revealed the Switch 2 console in January 2025.



From what we know officially and what's been widely reported, the Switch successor will pack in more power than the original while maintaining its winning blend of home console and handheld functionality. Here's everything you need to know.



What is the Nintendo Switch 2?

It's official: Nintendo is making a successor to its wildly popular Switch console. Granted, that's no surprise to anyone that's followed the video game industry for more than a minute. But now we've seen what's coming.



Nintendo shared the first official teaser video below on January 16, 2025, sharing many key details for the Switch 2 while still playing coy on others. We've learned a lot from this video, no doubt, but there's still plenty we want to know.

But this isn't the first time that Nintendo has officially commented. On May 7, 2024, Nintendo's official corporate account tweeted the following statement:

""This is Furukawa, President of Nintendo. We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation.""

This is Furukawa, President of Nintendo. We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Direct… — 任天堂株式会社（企業広報・IR） (@NintendoCoLtd) May 7, 2024

Even ahead of the May 2024 announcement, Nintendo was clearly planning for what’s next. In response to a fan question in June 2023, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said, “As for the transition from Nintendo Switch to the next-generation machine, we want to do as much as possible in order to smoothly transition our customers, while utilizing the Nintendo Account.”

When will the Nintendo Switch 2 come out?

Reports had long pointed to a late 2024 release target, but that didn't happen. Now, with the official trailer launch, all we have is a ""2025"" release window.



We can make some educated guesses here, however. Nintendo will hold a Direct livestream on April 2, 2025 at 9am ET to presumably share much more about the console, and then hold hands-on events in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas throughout the rest of the month, with the last announced event ending on April 27.

Nothing is official, but a June release target has been widely reported, including in a late March report from Insider Gaming citing retailer launch documents. Pre-orders are expected to begin either April 2, following the stream, or a week later on April 9.

Any in-demand console launch is inevitably plagued by shortages, but Nintendo's president says the company is already thinking ahead to how to minimize the impact the next time around.

In an investor-centric Q&A from June 2024 translated from Japanese by IGN, Shuntaro Furukawa said that Nintendo is thinking ahead to supply issues and looking into how local laws and regulations could help stymie the resale market that many consoles get snapped up and sold into at inflated prices. Furthermore, the firm doesn't anticipate significant component shortages that could slow console manufacturing.

“Although we were unable to produce sufficient quantities of Nintendo Switch hardware last year and the year before due to a shortage of semiconductor components, this situation has now been resolved,"" he said. ""At this time, we do not believe that the shortage of components will have a significant impact on the production of the successor model.""

In February 2025, during the firm's latest earnings call, Furukawa reiterated that the company is aiming to discourage scalpers from buying up available stock for the resale market.

“We will take all possible measures based on the experience we have accumulated to date (regarding scalpers and the like). We are making preparations,"" he said, per Nikkei (via VGC).

Even with Nintendo's preparations, however, there's concern that launch supplies won't meet demand. The unnamed ""large U.S. retailer"" that provided documents to Insider Gaming is expecting a day-one pre-order sellout, for example.

How much will the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?

Officially, we don't know yet: Nintendo hasn't said anything on this front. But there's been plenty of speculation.

The original Switch launched for $300 in 2017, with the purely handheld Switch Lite rolling out for $200 in 2019. With some premium enhancements (including a larger, bolder screen), the Nintendo Switch OLED model shipped for $350 in 2021.

In October 2023, a leaker—who WCCF Tech said has previously shared reliable information—claimed that the price point for the Switch 2 will be $449 for the base model and $400 for a version that is fully digital without cartridge support. The official Switch 2 trailer did not showcase or point to any fully digital model, however, so that may not actually be in the works.

The Switch 2 will launch into an increasingly competitive handheld landscape that includes many PC gaming devices. Valve's popular Steam Deck, for example, starts at $399 for the base model with an LCD screen, while more robust models with OLED panels start at $549.

What will the Nintendo Switch 2 look like?

After a whole ton of speculation, much of which was right on-target, we can finally say: The Switch 2 looks like a bigger Switch, mostly.

Nintendo thankfully isn't ditching the Switch's smash-success hybrid design, delivering a handheld that can easily be docked for TV use. At its core, the Switch 2 doesn't change too much. But there are some notable tweaks and upgrades we're seeing from the trailer and official imagery so far.

First off, the screen and Joy-Con attachment controllers are definitely larger. If we had to guess on screen size, we'd estimate somewhere around 7-8 inches, compared to 6.2 inches on the normal Switch. But Nintendo has yet to release official specs.

The model shown in the first trailer ditches the bold red and blue Joy-Con designs of the original launch model, instead going for a sleek black or perhaps dark gray scheme with red and blue accents under the analog sticks and in the connective tissue between the console (screen) unit and controllers.

Instead of having these Joy-Con controllers slide into place, they'll plug in via an adapter port and be held in place with what appear to be magnets. There had been significant speculation that the Switch 2 will use electromagnets to keep the controllers in place. We can also see from the trailer that there's a new release button on the back of each Joy-Con that triggers a small plunger to disconnect them from the unit.

Furthermore, there appears to be a new sensor on the Switch 2 Joy-cons that lets them be used like a computer mouse on a flat surface, once plugged into the wrist strap attachments. This appears to confirm speculation regarding mouse-like functionality, enabling more advanced control schemes for games like shooters, strategy sims, and maybe even creative apps.

Nintendo even has the Joy-Cons scurrying around like little techie mice in the trailer. But the right Joy-Con appears to ditch the infrared camera found on the original model, which was barely used by many games anyway.

Other interesting details from the trailer: The new kickstand is much larger and hopefully sturdier than that of the original Switch, allowing for more freestanding positions. Also, there are now two USB-C ports—one on top and one on the bottom. Is the extra one meant to enable potentially new accessories?

In an updated render shared by Nintendo in late March, the small button at the bottom of the face of the right Joy-con controller now has a ""C"" emblazoned on it. Will it be a ""Cast"" button for streaming, or is it something else entirely? We should find out next week.

And we know that the Switch 2 will continue to use the same physical cartridges from the Switch—yes, enabling backwards compatability—along with downloadable games.

How powerful will the Nintendo Switch 2 be?

Nintendo hasn't shared official specs yet, and the one game from the trailer didn't give a great sense of a visual upgrade. But we certainly expect a notable step up from what the original Switch could handle.

Reports suggest that Nintendo will not try to compete with the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X as the standard-bearers for home consoles and instead deliver a gaming experience with a bit less fidelity. That's been the standard Nintendo approach for a few generations now. Even so, it sounds like a significant improvement over the Switch.

In September 2023, leaked documents from major game publisher Activision showed that the company had evaluated the hardware in late 2022, ultimately surmising that the Switch successor will have similar power to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One hardware.

While those are 10-year-old home consoles, it still would be a notable step up from what the original Switch can handle. The Switch’s hybrid home-plus-handheld model also means that Nintendo has to keep in mind a slim form factor and battery life expectations, so it’s unlikely that we’d even see a Switch-like device with top-end internals at a reasonable price.

Eurogamer reported that Nintendo showed off private tech demos for the Switch 2 to developers at the Gamescom conference in August 2023, and that it used an upgraded version of 2017’s hit The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as a demonstration of the new hardware’s capabilities.

VGC supported that report and added that Nintendo also used Epic Games’ The Matrix Awakens tech demo for Unreal Engine 5, with capabilities like ray tracing (realistic lighting effects) and AI-driven visual upscaling tricks enabled. Another rumor points to the use of ""ray reconstruction,"" a less hardware-intensive way of delivering ray tracing effects with the help of AI, via Nvidia's DLSS 3.5 tech.

All told, this may point to hardware that is actually more capable than the PS4 or Xbox One, even if it doesn’t quite match the benchmarks of the current-gen PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. It could be relatively well equipped in terms of RAM, however, with noted leaker Felipe Lima suggesting that the device with have 12GB onboard—that's more than the Xbox Series S console at 10GB.

A February 2024 report from Reuters cites a source claiming that the Switch 2 will use a custom Nvidia chip, much like the original Switch hardware did.

According to a January 2024 report from Bloomberg, Omdia analyst Hiroshi Hayase says that Nintendo has picked a sizable 8-inch display for the Switch 2, and the display will use LCD tech as other reports have previously noted. Nintendo declined comment. The current Switch OLED model has a 7-inch screen, so this would be larger than any original Switch device.

Mobapad also points to an 8-inch display, which it says it be upgraded from 720p HD resolution on the original Switch to 1080p Full HD resolution on the successor.

What games will the Nintendo Switch 2 have?

We know one for sure: a new Mario Kart, revealed in the Switch 2 trailer. We don't have an official name yet; Mario Kart 9 would make sense based on the series' mainline entries, though earlier rumors pointed to a name of Mario Kart X to account for the mobile game Mario Kart Tour launching since Mario Kart 8 on Wii U (and later Switch).

Whatever the final name, the new Mario Kart looks much like what we've come to expect from the series, though the brief tease appears to show 24 starting spots on the track—so there may be way more racers than usual.

You can bet that we’ll see Nintendo’s tried-and-true franchises like Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and many others in the mix before long, though Nintendo hasn't shown anything else besides Mario Kart just yet. Previous rumors have pointed to games like a new Donkey Kong or Ubisoft's next as-yet-unannounced Far Cry sequel, but those remain unconfirmed for now.

The long-delayed Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is still set to launch on the original Switch in 2025, Nintendo confirmed in February—but it's been widely rumored to also launch on Switch 2.

In fact, many gamers have suspected that the game's trailer is actually showing Switch 2 footage, but that hasn't been confirmed. But really, why wouldn't Nintendo release it across both consoles? There's precedent too: Nintendo launched The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the same date across Switch and Wii U, and Zelda: Twilight Princess just weeks apart across Wii and GameCube.

Electronic Arts appears to be onboard with the Switch 2, and while that might sound obvious, EA hasn't put a new Madden NFL game on a Nintendo console since 2012. It's true: Madden never hit the Switch, and the company has been pretty selective with Nintendo games in the past.

""Any time a new console comes into the marketplace, that's of a benefit to us,"" EA CEO Andrew Wilson said during an earnings call in February 2025, per GameSpot. ""It gives us the ability to access and acquire new players. Typically, we've had franchises perform very well on Nintendo platforms. Certainly, our expectation is that products like [EA Sports] FC and Madden and others might find real energy on the platform as they have done in the past.""

Microsoft is also planning to support the Switch 2 with Xbox games, as part of the firm's recent expansion to bring its owned franchises to other hardware. Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in January 2025 that he's ""really looking forward to supporting"" Nintendo's next console with games.

After Rockstar Games' official reveal of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is currently announced for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, it begs the question: Will it come to Switch 2, too? And perhaps more pressingly, will the Switch 2 be powerful enough to run it?

There's no official word for now, of course, and there wouldn't be until Nintendo actually reveals its next console. But in the meantime, the technical experts at Digital Foundry are dubious that the Switch 2 will have enough power to handle Rockstar's next big game—at least based on the leaks so far.

""I’d love to say it would happen. I don’t think it will, realistically,"" said Digital Foundry founder Richard Leadbetter in a YouTube video (via IGN). ""It’s a mobile chipset. We’ve seen a lot of amazing things on the Switch 1. Switch 2 is going to be a lot better, a proper generational leap, and forward-looking in many ways. But the stuff they seem to be rolling out for GTA 6 is possibly beyond that.""

""It seems a step beyond,"" he added, ""and out of character with what we know about Rockstar’s M.O.""

Will it play original Switch games?

Yes! Nintendo tweeted on November 5, 2024 that the ""successor to the Nintendo Switch"" will also be able to play original Switch software. This had been rumored and reported previously, but the gaming giant cleared up any questions about Switch owners making a graceful transition to the new device. The Switch Online service will also return on Switch 2.

This is Furukawa. At today's Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch. Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor to Nintendo Switch as well. Further information about… — 任天堂株式会社（企業広報・IR） (@NintendoCoLtd) November 6, 2024

Nintendo repeated the message in the January 2025 trailer, showing that Switch cartridges will fit into the Switch 2, and noting that digital games will also be supported. A physical copy of Super Mario Bros. Wonder was shown in the trailer. However, there was a caveat: Some games may not be supported or work in full.

What does that mean? While we don't know for sure yet, it's likely that some games designed for the size and shape of the original Joy-Cons—like fitness game Ring Fit Adventure, which had players snap their controllers into an accessory shell—simply won't work with the Switch 2 controllers. And the rare few games that used the IR camera on the original right Joy-Con, like 1-2 Switch, similarly will lose functionality on Switch 2 hardware.

The other lingering question about backwards compatibility is whether the Switch games will simply run as-is, or if they will take advantage of the Switch 2's expected performance bump—whether that's an automatic upgrade, or one that developers may need to code and patch in.

A report from Eurogamer in February 2024 suggested that Nintendo will let users play their original Switch games (both physical and digital) in the Switch 2 hardware with enhancements. Developers will reportedly need to update their games to unlock such upgrades, however, which means not every game will necessarily take advantage of the Switch 2's improved power.

A New Jersey regulator has ordered Kalshi and Robinhood to stop offering prediction markets based on sporting events to New Jersey locals.

Robinhood partnered with Kalshi earlier this month to launch a prediction market focused on March Madness, the NCAA basketball tournament.

In a cease-and-desist-order dated Thursday, which was viewed by Decrypt, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement alleged the trading platforms have illegally offered sports wagering services in The Garden State. The regulator called for both companies to stop allowing New Jersey residents to place bets on athletics events and void existing sports-related wagers from people living there.

Robinhood and Kalshi must comply with the order by the end of March 28 or face enforcement actions, according to the letter.

“This letter shall serve as official notice that Robinhood [and Kalshi], by facilitating and/or accepting unauthorized sports wagering from individuals within the State of New Jersey, is engaging in activity that is unlawful under not only New Jersey law, but New Jersey’s Constitution,” NJGDE Interim Director Mary Jo Flaherty said in the letter.

The state regulator added that the trading platforms’ actions violate the New Jersey Sports Wagering Act, which “only permits licensed entities to offer sports wagering to patrons located in New Jersey.”

Nearly two weeks ago, Robinhood launched its March Madness prediction markets powered by Kalshi to capitalize on traders’ growing appetites for sports betting. Legal sports wagers exceeded $140 billion in 2024, up roughly 23% from the year prior, CBS Sports reported.

However, prediction market operators such as Kalshi have encountered several regulatory obstacles as they aim to address that growing market.

Earlier this month, Kalshi received orders from regulators in Nevada to stop offering derivatives trading on professional and college athletics events in the state. And this week, Barrons reported Washington state regulators are considering issuing Kalshi a similar directive.

""Event contracts offered by Robinhood Derivatives are federally regulated by the CFTC and offered through CFTC-registered entities, assuring that retail customers can access these prediction markets in a safe and regulated manner,"" Robinhood said through a spokesperson. ""While we do not believe these contracts run afoul of any state laws, we are no longer allowing New Jersey residents to enter new positions for the Men’s and Women’s Basketball Tournament event contacts.”

A Kalshi spokesperson told Decrypt that the company might comment later.

https://decrypt.co,Galaxy Digital Agrees to $200 Million Settlement Over LUNA 'Misrepresentations',https://decrypt.co/312154/galaxy-digital-200-million-luna-settlement,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 20:22:38 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

The New York Attorney General and Galaxy Digital have agreed to a settlement over the crypto firm’s handling of the collapsed Terra LUNA cryptocurrency, with the agreement requiring Galaxy to pay $200 million for alleged violations of the Martin Act and New York Executive Law.

A 49-page filing from the Office of the Attorney General of New York (OAG) outlines the investigation and the Office’s conclusions, alleging that “Galaxy’s conduct, including its misrepresentations and omissions about LUNA while simultaneously selling LUNA and failing to disclose its then-present intent to sell, constituted violations” of the above laws.

“This was not an easy decision and one that we considered carefully. Settling this matter will help Galaxy move forward and minimize distractions so that we can focus on our mission of driving innovation and growth in digital assets and artificial intelligence infrastructure,” said Galaxy CEO Michael Novogratz, in a statement.

Novogratz’s firm initially purchased more than 18.5 million LUNA tokens for $0.22 per token, a 30% discount from the spot price in October 2020 as part of an agreement with Terraform Labs.

The OAG’s findings indicate that a Galaxy memo sent on the same day of the agreement proposed that as part of the trade, “Galaxy would make the public more aware of the Terra ecosystem.”

Later public awareness, particularly from Novogratz, is central to the findings outlined by the OAG, which highlight his personal promotion of Terraform Labs’ LUNA token through posts on X (formerly Twitter), podcast interviews, and even via a tattoo that he promised to get if LUNA reached $100.

“But while Novogratz posted pictures of his tattoo and expressed his LUNA bullishness to the public, Galaxy sold millions of tokens into the market at many multiples of its initial cost without disclosing that it was selling,” the filing reads.

Shortly after getting his tattoo, the OAG’s findings showed that Novogratz’ firm netted more than $100 million via LUNA token sales from January 5-13, 2022, despite the fact that he urged his social media followers to “keep the faith” as LUNA fell from its $100 mark.

Markets always consolidate after huge moves. 100 was a symbolic number. Corresponded with 10bn in $UST. I’d expect consolidation before the next leg up. Watch activity. Watch stable coin growth. Watch new projects. If they grow so will $LUNA. Keep the faith🌕 — Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) January 5, 2022

The OAG findings note that the firm sold more LUNA tokens throughout January and February, leaving it with only “2,060 LUNA as of February 28, 2022.”

In March 2022, Galaxy Digital Research noted a known risk in the LUNA token that could result in a “death spiral” for the first time.

Two months later, that death spiral appeared. Terraform Labs’ algorithmic TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin lost its 1:1 peg to the U.S. Dollar and the LUNA token collapsed alongside, ultimately leading the formerly top 10 token to trade for less than 1 cent, greatly impacting cryptocurrency investors worldwide.

As part of the Assurance of Discontinuation filing, Galaxy did not admit to or deny the findings. In addition to the $200 million payment, which must be made over the next three years, Galaxy must also create and maintain policies and procedures regarding public statements on cryptocurrencies that it may have interest in.

Earlier this year, Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon pleaded not guilty to U.S. criminal charges over the Terra ecosystem collapse.

Iași, Romania, March 28th, 2025, Chainwire

74% of $NATO’s 1 trillion token supply was distributed in one of the largest airdrops ever — now trading live on Uniswap, AscendEX, and Poloniex

The Nation Token ($NATO), a decentralized token on the Base blockchain, has announced its official launch following a historic airdrop to one million active Base wallets. As of today, $NATO is trading live on Uniswap, Poloniex, and AscendEX.

In December 2024, 74% of the total 1 trillion $NATO supply — 740 billion tokens — was airdropped evenly to 1 million randomly selected Base wallets, with each wallet receiving 740,000 $NATO. This marks one of the largest and most distributed token airdrops in blockchain history. Uniswap liquidity has been locked until January 1, 2030, reinforcing the commitment to long-term decentralization. The contract address for $NATO on Base is: 0xd968196fa6977c4e58f2af5ac01c655ea8332d22

Why the Nation Token Was Created

$NATO was born out of a growing concern with the direction of many modern cryptocurrencies — specifically, the increasing trend toward centralization. From token allocations to liquidity control and governance influence, too many projects are dominated by a small group of insiders, leaving everyday holders with little to no say.

The Nation Token aims to break that pattern by creating a truly community-owned and community-governed asset, where every decision and milestone is driven by the people, aligning of its mantra of #PowerToThePeople. A governance platform is currently in final development to enable token holders to vote on proposals and roadmap decisions — completing one of the final pillars of $NATO’s decentralization framework.

Speaking about the recent listings of $NATO, Andrei Popescu, CMO said “This is a true experiment in decentralized financial empowerment, proving that the power of the people can shape the market like never before. Our goal is simple yet ground-breaking—to make $NATO the first token in history to reach high goals purely through collective effort.”

Momentum and Growth

Following its initial Uniswap listing (paired with WETH), $NATO saw growth in trading activity. In the two weeks following, both Poloniex and AscendEX listed $NATO (paired with USDT), resulting in a 10x increase in trading volume according to the team. Additional exchange listings are already in the pipeline.

To drive further awareness and participation, the team has launched a community growth campaign at https://taskon.xyz/TheNationToken

Participants can compete for a $1,000 USDC monthly prize pool, split among the top 50 leaderboard members, based on engagement and learning activities around the project. This gives a further incentive for both airdrop recipients, as well as new token holders to retain their tokens.

For more information about The Nation Token and its mission, users can visit https://thenationtoken.com, or follow the project on X at https://x.com/NatoTok3n or join the citizens on Telegram at https://t.me/TheNationToken

About $NATO - The Nation Token

The Nation Token is a decentralized community-owned token built on Base, that resulted from one of the biggest airdrops in the chain’s history, as 1 million wallets received a share of 740 billion tokens. The project focuses on fair distribution, transparency, and long-term community governance.

Discover SCENE

Singapore, Singapore, March 28th, 2025, Chainwire

Justin Sun, Global Advisor of HTX and Founder of TRON, has been featured on the daily cover of Forbes digital assets, marking a significant milestone in the blockchain industry. Sun becomes the second Chinese entrepreneur, after Jack Ma, and the fourth crypto exchange figure, following CZ, SBF, and Brian Armstrong, to achieve this prestigious recognition. Forbes profiles Sun as a ""Crypto Billionaire Who Helped The Trumps Make $400 Million,"" highlighting his distinct influence and global vision.

Sun's Crypto Empire: From Disruptor to Industry Leader

The Forbes feature portrays Sun as a figure of ""youth, controversy, and immense wealth."" Born in 1990, Sun has built a reputation for bold, unconventional moves within the blockchain space. ""In my 20s I was just trying everything,"" Sun shares, illustrating his hands-on, entrepreneurial approach to innovation.

Over the past decade, Sun has developed a comprehensive crypto ecosystem encompassing public chains, payment networks, exchanges, and decentralized finance (DeFi). His flagship project, TRON, ranks among the fastest-growing blockchain networks in the world, with over 300 million users and daily transaction volumes exceeding ten million. This achievement underscores his vision for a ""global payment system"" and reflects the increasing mainstream adoption of blockchain technologies.

As Global Advisor of HTX, Sun has helped steer the exchange to new heights. HTX was recently recognized by Forbes as one of the “Top 25 World’s Most Trustworthy Crypto Exchanges of 2025”. Under Sun’s leadership, HTX has championed compliance, security, and user experience, setting a benchmark for the convergence of traditional finance and crypto innovation. The synergy between HTX and TRON, facilitated by Sun’s strategic guidance, is driving seamless resource integration through technological interoperability.

Forbes Cover Recognition: A Testament to Global Leadership

Sun’s appearance on the Forbes cover underscores his growing influence on the global crypto stage. He joins a short list of visionary leaders from the crypto exchange world, alongside CZ, SBF, and Brian Armstrong, who have earned this recognition.

In a post on X, Sun remarked, “From a visionary to a global force — honored to be featured on Forbes as Crypto’s Billionaire Barker.”

Previously, Forbes Portugal included Sun in its “40 Notable Blockchain Entrepreneurs to Watch” list, where he ranked second—only behind Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Notably, Sun was the only Chinese entrepreneur in the top three, representing the highest placement ever for a Chinese figure in a global blockchain ranking. Forbes has also consistently named Sun in its ""30 Under 30 Asia"" lists and has noted his wide-ranging interests, including art collection, gaming, investment, philanthropy, and space exploration.

In late 2024, Justin was appointed as Prime Minister of the Republic of Liberland, aiming to redefine the crypto space with principles of freedom and innovation.

Strategic Collaborations and Industry Mission: Mainstreaming Crypto

The Forbes article also highlights Sun’s collaboration with the Trump family, a partnership that reportedly generated over $400 million.

Public Keys is a weekly roundup from Decrypt that tracks the key publicly traded crypto companies. This week: GameStop makes a big splash with its Bitcoin announcement, then fumbles with a debt offering; BTC miners are in for a world of hurt as fees shrink; and Robinhood gets a New Jersey slap on the wrist for its prediction market debut.

GameStop presses play on Bitcoin

There was a lot of excitement for GameStop’s Q4 earnings report because it was heavily hinted—and then confirmed—that the company was going to start buying Bitcoin.

(There’s a rapidly growing list of publicly traded companies that buy Bitcoin.)

The video game retailer, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the GME ticker, reported $4.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of February 1—up from $921 million the same time last year.

But instead of using a portion of that cash to buy Bitcoin, it’s raising $1.3 billion in a convertible note offering. GME investors are not pleased, but traders are finding a way to profit on the news: Short volume yesterday was the highest it’s been since meme stock influencer Roaring Kitty made his return last summer.

Meanwhile, GME has erased its BTC bump and sank near a six-month low. By Friday afternoon, the price of GME was hovering around $22 and had lost 12.9% over the past five days.

Investors have noted on X, formerly Twitter, that more than 71% of GME volume is being traded off exchanges in dark pools. This is how institutional investors, like hedge funds, mutual funds, and pensions carry out large transactions without having to immediately disclose them publicly.

The incredible, shrinking Bitcoin fees

Troubling news for miners: Bitcoin transaction fees have been shrinking.

BlocksBridge Consulting noted in its newsletter this week that transaction fees now make up only 1.25% of total block rewards. That’s the lowest it’s been since April 2022.

“Without a significant uptick in Bitcoin’s market price or a revival in transaction fees, these miners may soon face an unmanageable situation: they may no longer be able to compete,” BlockBridge analysts wrote.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market, are in the throes of a rout. The global crypto market cap has sunk by 5.5% in the past 24 hours and the price of Bitcoin is down 3.7% to $83,804.62, according to CoinGecko data.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin miners told Decrypt at a conference earlier this week that pivoting data warehouses to serve high-performance computing and AI clients has come with its own set of challenges.

For starters, Bitcoin miners can—and often do—turn their rigs off to save money. But that doesn’t fly when you’re handling workloads for AI startups.

“We’re interruptible [as Bitcoin miners], whereas a traditional data center needs [to be] on 100% of the time,” Shanon Squires from Compass Mining told Decrypt, adding that this ups costs big time.

Paging CoreWeave quote

Speaking of Bitcoin miners pivoting to AI, Nvidia-backed AI hyperscaler CoreWeave began trading on the Nasdaq under the CRWV ticker—or so we were told.

(Remember: CoreWeave, began as a crypto miner focused on Ethereum in 2019, before gradually pivoting to AI as Ethereum switched to a proof-of-stake consensus in 2022 and rendered Ethereum miners obsolete.)

The company’s CEO rang the opening bell on Friday to mark the IPO, which priced shares at $40 and sought to raise $1.5 billion. For a time, it was expected that CRWV would raise up to $2.7 billion with price estimates as high as $55 per share.

But for the better part of the day, it was impossible to find a stock quote for CRWV. And when it did show up, around 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time, the share price had fallen 5.5% to $37.81. But it recovered slightly and looked to be ending its first day of trading having gained 2.4%.

An unnamed person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that three unnamed investors bought half of the $1.5 billion offering. And Nvidia was rumored to snap up $250 million worth of the offering. In other words, a handful of wealthy people juiced the IPO to make it appear more successful than it otherwise would have been, according to Bloomberg's reporting.

One of the issues analysts have flagged with CRWV is the background of its founders. As Matt Turck, partner at venture capital firm FirstMark, put it on X, they come from a financial, rather than technological, background.

But even with two finance co-founders, the financials haven’t looked great.

“CoreWeave remains deeply unprofitable”, Turck wrote in a blog post.“ It incurred a net loss of $31M in 2022, which widened to $593.7 million in 2023 and $863.4 million in 2024​ (-45% margin). In other words, expenses grew almost as fast as revenue – the 2024 net loss was about 45% of revenue (an improvement from 2023, when the net loss exceeded 2× annual revenue).”

Time out for Robinhood?

First, the good news: Robinhood put some extra shine on its Gold premium membership earlier this week.

The crypto and stock trading platform, which trades on the Nasdaq under the HOOD ticker, is now going to include access to Robinhood Strategies, which aims to deliver ""tailor, expert-managed portfolios,” tickets to exclusive events such as the Oscars, private jet travel, and same-day delivery of cash direct to a customer's doorstep.

This led Bernstein analysts to set a $105 price target for HOOD—more than double the company’s current share price of $41.65.

But, according to The Closing Line, state regulators have a problem with another recent update from the company: Its sports prediction markets.

The New Jersey Division of Gaming and Entertainment sent a letter to the companies, alleging the markets are “unauthorised sports wagering services” and should not be available to state residents.

Midnight tonight is the deadline for Kalshi and Robinhood to acknowledge receipt of the letter and shut off access for New Jersey residents. At approximately 3 p.m. Eastern Time, this New Jersey resident could still see the markets in her Robinhood app.

Other keys

Trading platform eToro, which paired its crypto offerings back to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash as part of an SEC settlement, is now making a run for an initial public offering. But it remains to be seen whether eToro will bring back crypto to lure in new users.

But having been on- and off-again with most crypto assets doesn’t seem to have hurt its performance.

In its SEC filing, the company reported that crypto accounted for 38% of the company’s commissions, up from 17% the year before. And total commissions grew to $931 million, up 46% from $639 million in 2023.

Three co-founders of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX—Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed—were pardoned by President Trump on Friday, according to a report from CNBC.

All three founders pled guilty in 2022 to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act for failing to operate an anti-money laundering program at the cryptocurrency exchange. Each founder also agreed to pay a $10 million fine to settle the charges.

""Thank you,"" Hayes posted on X Friday afternoon, tagging the official President of the United States account.

Decrypt could not immediately reach BitMEX’s founders, and BitMEX did not immediately respond to questions.

Most recently, in January, Manhattan federal judge Judge John G. Koeltl ordered the exchange to pay $100 million to settle violations that took place between 2015 and 2020. The exchange said it was happy with the outcome.

Regulators alleged initially that BitMEX had allowed U.S. clients to use its exchange without verifying their identities.

In 2021, BitMEX paid $100 million in civil penalties after the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, alleged that the exchange’s senior leadership “altered U.S. customer information to hide the customer’s true location.”

President Trump campaigned with a pro-business agenda, and spoke frequently about the tech and crypto spheres—even once attending a Bitcoin conference.

A number of top crypto companies have had charges against them or investigations dropped since the new commander in chief took office, and crypto-friendly regulators have taken positions in the Trump Administration and at financial watchdogs.

Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are in the red Friday, with top coins falling to their lowest prices in at least a week as stock markets are similarly rattled by hotter-than-expected inflation data.

The price of Bitcoin dipped to $83,609 early Friday afternoon, and is currently down about 4% on the day at a current price of $83,736. It's down just 0.4% on the week, but the Friday slide has cooled rising momentum seen in recent days.

Other top coins have shown sharper losses over the past day, however, with Ethereum down 6% to $1,875 and XRP falling about 7% to $2.17. Both fell to weekly lows on Friday alongside Bitcoin.

Solana and Dogecoin are also in the red Friday, down 6% and 4.5% respectively over the past day, though both coins remain up over the last week.

Amid the declines, crypto liquidations have surged over the past day, tallying more than $450 million as of this writing per data from CoinGlass. Long positions make up the bulk of the carnage at $402 million, and Ethereum is the biggest contributor to liquidations with $136 million worth in total. Bitcoin is next at $118 million.

Both the Dow and S&P 500 indices are down more than 2% Friday, with traders reacting to continued inflation fears and the impact of Trump's ever-evolving trade tariffs on other nations. The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) rose 0.4% in February, as reported Friday—a higher market than expected and the biggest monthly leap in more than a year.

""Today's price action shows that investors are not ready for a long-term tariff engagement by the U.S.,"" Mark Connors, chief investment strategist for Bitcoin investment advisory Risk Dimensions, told Decrypt. ""Portfolio managers are taking risk off the table to fight another day, until the impact of tariffs have greater clarity.""

Nvidia's stock is down about 1.5% on the day, while the Nvidia-backed cloud computing firm CoreWeave—which began trading Friday—is down by about 1% as of this writing.

But crypto stocks are taking much harder hits than the broader markets, with Strategy (MSTR) down about 10% on the day and Coinbase falling by nearly 7% as of this writing.

Connors also noted the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's gloominess about GDP in the current quarter: ""So today's move validates what Atlanta Fed GDPNow forecast has versus what the Street has. That, to me, is the real signal out of today.""

https://decrypt.co,Bitcoin Reserve ‘Crucial’ for Brazil's Prosperity: Lula Administration,https://decrypt.co/312147/bitcoin-reserve-crucial-for-brazils-prosperity,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 17:44:23 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

A high-ranking official in Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration declared Tuesday that a potential strategic Bitcoin reserve would be ""determinant for our prosperity"" and ""in the (country’s) public interest.""

Pedro Giocondo Guerra, chief of staff to Vice President Geraldo Alckmin, made the remarks while officially representing the federal government at a congressional ceremony.

Debating the establishment of a sovereign bitcoin reserve rigorously is a matter of public interest and will be crucial for our prosperity,” Guerra said according to local media outlet Poder360. “Bitcoin is digital gold—the gold of the internet. It is a technology that allows wealth to be transferred across the globe swiftly and enables us to store the fruits of our labor efficiently and securely.”

The statement underscored the country’s heightened interest in Bitcoin amid a growing list of countries that have made it part of their political strategies.

Guerra’s comments came shortly after deputy Eros Biondini (PL-MG) introduced legislation proposing the creation of a ""Strategic Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve"" (RESBit). That bill would mandate the government acquire Bitcoin up to 5% of Brazil's international reserves, with the Brazilian Central Bank handling custody using advanced monitoring systems and blockchain technology and AI to monitor transactions.

Brazil's existing crypto landscape is already robust. The country started approving spot cryptocurrency ETFs before any other nation in the Americas and offers diverse investment vehicles. These include FOMO11, which tracks market sentiment, DEFI11 for a basket of DeFi coins, HASH11, one of the most traded ETFs in the Brazilian market, and even a Solana spot ETF approved on august 2024.

The proposed legislation outlines multiple objectives for the Bitcoin reserve. These include diversifying the National Treasury's financial assets, protecting international reserves against currency fluctuations and geopolitical risks, promoting blockchain technology adoption across public and private sectors, and providing backing for Brazil's controversial CBDC, the DREX.

If approved, the bill would require the government to implement the reserve gradually while adhering to fiscal responsibility laws and ensuring public account stability. The legislation also mandates transparent management with biannual reports to Congress.

The bill must still navigate the full legislative process, requiring approval from various committees, passage in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, and finally presidential approval or veto.

According to Biondini's proposal, the Bitcoin reserve would position Brazil ""at the forefront of the digital economy"" and increase the country's economic resilience by reducing exposure to currency fluctuations and geopolitical risks.

The bill references Brazil's high adoption rate of cryptocurrencies, noting that in 2022, approximately 16% of the Brazilian population reported having used or owned crypto assets according to research by Finder. It argues this widespread adoption should be reflected in government strategy to avoid putting the country at a disadvantage internationally.

El Salvador famously declared Bitcoin legal tender and has been acquiring one Bitcoin daily for its national reserves, reportedly generating significant profits through the asset's appreciation. Venezuela has also established a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and allegedly holds some Bitcoin in its international reserves. Colombia conducted a sandbox to evaluate how bank institutions could work alongside crypto exchanges to provide financial services.

Earlier this month, The proposal follows an executive order signed by the U.S. President Donald Trump on March 6 that established an American Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency seized in law enforcement operations. and prohibited further sales of the digital assets.

https://decrypt.co,Why 'Off the Grid' Maker Gunzilla Revived Game Informer Magazine,https://decrypt.co/312131/why-gunzilla-revived-game-informer-magazine,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 17:23:02 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Gunzilla Games, the studio behind crypto battle royale shooter Off the Grid, announced Tuesday that it had acquired the long-running Game Informer print magazine and online publication, months after it was shut down by its previous owner GameStop.

But why would a crypto game studio purchase a shuttered video game magazine and bring it back from the dead?

In an interview with Decrypt, Gunzilla Games Director of Web3 Theodore Agranat called this move “very crucial” to the studio’s long-term plans— and one that could benefit Off the Grid gamers in the future.

Game Informer is back! The entire team is returning and we can't wait to reconnect. Come join us to celebrate the best in games, the people who make games, and the people who play games from around the world. Learn more: https://t.co/oRgjZW1zfF pic.twitter.com/4nCNqzv2pX — Game Informer (@gameinformer) March 25, 2025

“We are the developer of the largest Web3 AAA gaming ecosystem, and that is GUNZ,” Agranat explained, referring to its dedicated Avalanche L1 network. “We firmly believe that this [acquisition] is a very crucial part of our long-term plans.”

While Gunzilla Games is best known for Off the Grid, a battle royale shooter that launched to substantial attention in early access last fall, its vision is much broader as it seeks to onboard third-party game developers to the GUNZ network—which is launching its mainnet and token on Monday.

As such, Agranat explained that it “makes sense” for GUNZ and Gunzilla Games to have “long-term alignment” with an iconic gaming magazine. Game Informer ran for 33 years before it was shuttered last August.

“We firmly believe that in the future, there [will be] no Web2 and Web3 gaming differences. It's just gaming,” Agranat told Decrypt. “We firmly believe that in the future, the biggest publishers in the world will embrace blockchain technology, and we want to be positioned as a AAA gaming ecosystem for that future.”

The reboot of Game Informer was met with a wave of delight from some fans, along with a healthy chunk of concern from Web3-skeptic gamers.

Fortunately for those readers, the magazine will operate as an independent entity, according to statements made by both Gunzilla and Game Informer—so much so that Agranat claimed that Gunzilla hasn’t even asked the editorial team if they enjoy crypto games. Agranat said he doesn’t believe that Game Informer or any other gaming magazine would “shadow ban” a good game based on whether or not it used crypto.

“We don't have an intention to alter our editorial coverage toward a specific area of focus,” Game Informer Editor-in-Chief Matt Miller told Decrypt. “We have always covered all kinds of games that we think might be interesting to our readers, and we have covered games that feature some crypto or NFT elements in the past; we continue to be open to that in the future.”

Gunzilla Games said it would be happy to provide Game Informer special access to its ecosystem that other publications wouldn’t have access to, although Miller explained that this type of coverage would be accompanied by an editorial disclosure.

We’re proud to announce Gunzilla Games has acquired the iconic @GameInformer. Welcome to the family! 🔗https://t.co/mL2xabYSTq pic.twitter.com/hdw6oClDKX — Gunzilla Games (@GunzillaGames) March 25, 2025

On top of this, Agranat said that if Game Informer wants to embrace blockchain, GUNZ and Gunzilla’s wider crypto tech stack will be available for the magazine to use at any time. However, Game Informer Executive Editor Brian Shea told Decrypt that the staff “currently have no plans to integrate that technology.”

Agranat also speculated that the acquisition could be beneficial for Off the Grid and GUNZ ecosystem players, suggesting that the premium Off the Grid Pro subscription—which offers exclusive rewards for players—could be bundled with a Game Informer subscription.

“I can envision that it [could] be an additional benefit to our gamers, to have access to this magazine—not having any kind of preconceived notion of what will be written about in Game Informer, because that's up to the journalistic staff,” he said. “But what is up to Gunzilla is: Where do the subscriptions go? What are the benefits to our gamers that are in our ecosystem?”

This acquisition came amid a busy week for Off the Grid as Gunzilla prepares to transition GUNZ to mainnet on Monday and launch the network’s native GUN token—a major milestone for the game and the broader Gunzilla ecosystem.

https://decrypt.co,Stablecoin Legislation Shouldn’t Force Issuers to Comply With Bank Secrecy Act: Rep. Tom Emmer,https://decrypt.co/312066/stablecoin-bills-unfairly-box-out-tether-house-majority-whip-emmer,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 15:58:15 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

In a potential sign of brewing tensions regarding key language in multiple stablecoin bills circulating in Congress, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) said this week he doesn’t believe stablecoin issuers like Tether should have to comply with the anti-money laundering Bank Secrecy Act—a major sticking point of both the Senate’s stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, and the House’s parallel STABLE Act.

Including such a provision in the legislation could box out foreign issuers while favoring U.S. companies, since U.S.-based entities are currently better equipped to meet stricter demands. The lawmaker believes stablecoin issuers, regardless of jurisdiction, should not be subject to the stringent anti-money laundering rules under the Bank Secrecy Act.

“The protections the so-called Bank Secrecy Act is supposed to provide were drafted for cash, and this is blockchain-driven,” Emmer told Decrypt Wednesday evening. “And guess what, everything on the blockchain is open and transparent to people who understand how to follow code.”

“It's pretty interesting to say that the Bank Secrecy Act—which doesn't even contemplate this type of technology, a digital asset—should be what we're using,” the congressman added.

Stablecoins are digital assets typically pegged to the U.S. dollar and designed to keep a steady price. They're used by cryptocurrency traders to enter and exit positions without the need for dollars, and used as dollar equivalents in markets where dollars are restricted or inaccessible.

The latest drafts of the GENIUS Act and STABLE Act treat all stablecoin issuers as financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act. The law, enacted in 1970, established a stringent set of proactive anti-money laundering rules that American banks must comply with in order to operate.

The Bank Secrecy Act, for example, obligates regulated institutions to engage in suspicious activity monitoring, undergo routine audits, hire compliance officers, and adopt a customer identification program mandated by the Patriot Act—the controversial law that expanded government surveillance powers shortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Such requirements would pose quite a hurdle for existing foreign stablecoin issuers like Tether, the company behind USDT and the market’s undisputed leader. Tether, whose USDT stablecoin boasts a market capitalization in excess of $144 billion, is based in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and plans to move to El Salvador—but nonetheless is one of the world’s biggest purchasers of U.S. Treasuries, which it uses as collateral to back its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin.

In its current setup, Tether enjoys much less strict regulation than the Bank Secrecy Act would mandate, and the company's leadership has implied that moves to force all stablecoin issuers to comply with such rules would hurt the firm and aid its competitors. By contrast, Circle, the issuer behind the market's second-largest stablecoin USDC, is already based in the United States. While Circle does not yet comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, the company is regulated as a money transmitter by the New York Department of Financial Services.

Circle is also already in compliance with the European Union's elaborate MiCA regulatory framework, a move Tether has resisted.

As stablecoin legislation in the U.S. nears a crescendo, questions have emerged regarding whether Tether would come to the United States if it had to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act—or, alternatively, what would happen if the stablecoin market’s top player was boxed out of American financial markets.

Emmer does not want to risk locking Tether, or any other foreign issuer, out of the burgeoning U.S. stablecoin sector.

“We've got to let everybody compete in this space,” he said.

That doesn’t mean Tether wouldn’t have to comply with certain rules in order to operate in the United States. To Emmer, the sticking point is proof of reserves—showing the government that your token is backed up with sufficient collateral to keep its value pegged to the dollar even in periods of market volatility.

To that end, Emmer believes Tether is, broadly speaking, doing well. In 2021, the company partnered with Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald to help custody some of the $92 billion worth of U.S. Treasuries it claims to currently hold in reserve.

“Tether has done a great job straightening itself out in the last four years,” Emmer said.

The House Financial Services Committee is set to mark up the STABLE Act during a session next week. Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act already passed out of the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month with strong bipartisan support—Bank Secrecy language intact. It is likely to face a full vote on the Senate floor in the coming months.

The NASDAQ exchange has applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to list shares of an Avalanche exchange-traded fund issued by crypto asset manager Grayscale.

The 19b-4 form for Grayscale's AVAX ETF follows its registration as a Delaware Trust entity more than two weeks ago.

If approved, the AVAX ETF would use Coinbase Custody as its custodian, the 19b-4 shows.

The issuer must still file an S-1 registration statement describing the product, however.

AVAX, the utility token of Layer-1 blockchain Avalanche, was recently trading at $20.17, down 8% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows.

The altcoin is the 17th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to the data provider.

This latest sign that Grayscale could soon file for a spot AVAX ETF comes less than three weeks after investment firm VanEck also registered for an Avalanche (AVAX) ETF in Delaware. Several asset managers already offer Avalanche ETPs, which provide direct access to the AVAX through regulated exchanges.

The application forms part of a broader trend of fund issuers jockeying to introduce altcoin ETFs as federal regulators take a softer stance on crypto-based investment products under newly elected President Donal Trump.

The spate of applications also comes after the success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year, and as crypto-based exchange-traded products pulled in $44 billion worth of assets in 2024.

Grayscale already offers spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to its clients. It has also applied to launch funds based on less traded cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, Solana and Dogecoin. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a conversion from an existing trust, manages nearly $17 billion in assets, the third most among Bitcoin funds behind similar products from BlackRock and Fidelity.

The Grayscale Ethereum Trust controls about $2.5 billion in assets.

The sentencing memorandum notes that Eisenberg states that he will not “break any more laws.”

Additionally, it notes that his cryptocurrency-related sentencing should be modified downward because:

“He researched the legality of the MNGO trade and found ample reason to draw the conclusion (which was rejected by the jury’s verdict) that the trade was not illegal.”

“He acted in an environment where the practice of actively identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities… is commonplace and financially rewarded.”

“He intended to, and did, repay a substantial amount of the money he obtained well before he was charged.”

Furthermore, regarding his child pornography charges, he claimed that he “initially considered all depictions of sexual activity so extremely sinful that he made no distinction between child pornography and adult pornography.”

Eisenberg’s letter to the judge further notes that he “believed that smart contracts were, in general, valid legal contracts.” Furthermore, he claims that he “did not want to cause users to lose funds.”

According to the report, Dominari has committed $2 million to buy shares of IBIT as of now. The stock has a market cap of about $70 million and has fallen more than 9% on Friday's trading.

Most companies that adopt a bitcoin reserve strategy buy the cryptocurrency outright and self-custody it or use a custodian. Dominari is instead gaining exposure through a regulated exchange-traded fund, a move that may appeal to firms looking for easier compliance and cleaner accounting.

The move isn’t surprising, given Donald Trump Jr.’s interest in crypto. The president’s son is involved in many crypto projects and has become an unofficial spokesperson for his father’s enthusiasm.

Just earlier this week, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the financial protocol backed by President Donald Trump and his family, pitched its own stablecoin at a crypto event in Washington.",decrypt

Bitcoin might soon be part of South Carolina’s balance sheet.

Introduced by state Rep. Jordan Pace, the “Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Act,” proposes that the state treasurer be allowed to allocate up to 10% of certain public funds into digital assets—starting with Bitcoin.

The House Bill 4256, or HB4256, seeks to authorize the state treasurer to purchase and hold Bitcoin as a strategic reserve within key state-managed funds, including the General Fund and Budget Stabilization Reserve Fund.

With a maximum cap of one million BTC, the bill outlines a secure framework for custody, mandates regular public audits, and allows for voluntary BTC donations from residents.

While BTC is the only digital asset named in the bill, it explicitly states the reserve “may include, but not be limited to, Bitcoin,” allowing for the future inclusion of other cryptocurrencies through updated rules.

“Proud to file legislation that empowers SC to follow Donald Trump’s lead to create a state level strategic crypto reserve,” Pace said on X, formerly Twitter, Thursday. “This gives the Treasurer new tools to protect taxpayer dollars from inflation,” he added..

In early March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, both of which would be seeded with Bitcoin seized in government criminal cases.

But there have been differing opinions on whether the U.S. should spend money to acquire BTC or stock it in a “budget neutral” way.

Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) followed up by introducing the BITCOIN Act, which would require the U.S. government to acquire up to one million BTC—worth about $80 billion—over a five-year period.

South Carolina’s bill lays out a comprehensive legal structure that includes definitions of cold storage, qualified custodians, and exchange-traded products.

It mandates biennial reports, regular independent security audits, and that any digital asset holdings not exceed 3% of the state’s overall investment portfolio.

The bill would expire on September 1, 2035, unless renewed, giving the state a decade to experiment with incorporating Bitcoin into its public finance strategy.

States' uneven embrace of Bitcoin

South Carolina’s proposed legislation is also part of a wider nationwide trend of states exploring the viability of adding Bitcoin to their reserves.

Arizona’s House recently advanced two major digital asset bills to a full vote, including one that allows the treasurer and retirement system to invest in Bitcoin and another to manage crypto seized from criminal cases.

Texas lawmakers passed Senate Bill 21 Bitcoin strategy reserve bill—SB21—earlier this month, which now awaits the Governor vote.

In Oklahoma, House Bill 1203 passed overwhelmingly and is awaiting Senate review. Kentucky recently passed legislation protecting Bitcoin self-custody and offering tax incentives for miners.

In Utah, Bitcoin legislation advanced, though references to a strategic reserve were dropped at the last minute.

Some states, however, are steering clear of the Bitcoin reserve trend—for now.

Wyoming lawmakers in Sen. Lummis’s home state recently saw their Bitcoin reserve proposal collapse in committee. Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon has since distanced himself from the effort, stressing a more cautious approach.

“Bitcoin has been incredibly volatile,” he told Decrypt at the DC Blockchain Summit, adding, “It’s been a bit of a learning curve.”

Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Pennsylvania have also abandoned similar bills.

France-based public investment bank Bpifrance announced Thursday plans to invest $27 million (€25 million) directly into tokens and decentralized technologies in an effort to “strengthen the French blockchain ecosystem.”

Announced during a blockchain-focused event in Paris, the bank’s investment seeks to accelerate its “digital asset investment strategy” by bolstering French crypto startups and assisting the local venture capital players in Web3.

“We are convinced of the growing importance that these players will take on in the years to come, and we want to increase French competitiveness and presence in the field of digital assets,” Arnaud Caudoux, Deputy CEO of Bpifrance, said in a Thursday statement.

Bpifrance’s new fund will complement its long-standing financial support mechanisms—like grants, loans, and equity funding—by targeting blockchain-native models with a strong “French footprint.”

DeFi, staking, tokenization, Layer 1–3 protocols, AI-driven tools, and digital ID solutions are among them.

It represents one of the first moves by a major state investment bank to purchase open-market crypto tokens—a “pioneering initiative,” as Bpifrance put it.

Bpifrance will specifically target “smaller, newly-issued tokens” from French projects—assets that have yet to be listed on exchanges.

""The U.S. is really accelerating its own crypto strategy, so this is all the more important,” Caudoux said as cited in a Reuters report, noting the U.S. crypto push under President Donald Trump as a wake-up call.

Since his re-election, Trump has pledged to make the U.S. the “undisputed Bitcoin superpower,” floated plans to mine Bitcoin domestically, and vowed to make the nation the “crypto capital” of the world.

The pro-crypto President’s administration has also rolled back SEC enforcement against crypto firms, drawing blockchain talent and capital toward the U.S. at a time when Europe remains cautious.

In response to developments in the U.S., Bpifrance's initiative seeks to retain and nurture blockchain talent within France.

Bpifrance is no stranger to crypto—it first backed hardware wallet firm Ledger in 2014 and has since invested in Aleph.im, Morpho, ACINQ, and others.

In a 2023 interview with Decrypt, Bpifrance’s Blockchain & Crypto Lead Ivan de Lastours said the bank was also exploring zero-knowledge proofs, noting their potential to verify authenticity in a world dominated by AI-generated content.

“They may be key to the future of the internet,” de Lastours said.

Walking the line

France’s broader crypto momentum got another boost this week when The Blockchain Group, a France-based tech firm listed on Euronext Paris, announced it had purchased 580 BTC, worth roughly $50.6 million.

While such initiatives show a proactive approach to Web3 innovation in France, it comes at a time when the country's regulatory bodies are intensifying scrutiny of the crypto sector.

In January, French authorities launched a judicial investigation into Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, over allegations of money laundering and tax fraud.

The probe focused on activities between 2019 and 2024, with potential offenses committed in France and the European Union. ​

In November 2024, the French gambling regulator, ANJ, began probing Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction market platform, to assess its compliance with French gambling laws.

The probe was triggered after a French trader reportedly placed a multi-million-dollar wager on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, prompting Polymarket to cut off access for users in France, effectively shutting out a significant segment of its audience.

Senator John Kennedy pressed SEC nominee Paul Atkins about investigating SBF’s parents during Senate hearing

Kennedy threatened to “pounce like a ninja” for updates on potential SEC investigation

SBF’s parents allegedly received a $16.4 million Bahamas mansion and millions in other benefits from FTX

Reports suggest SBF’s parents are seeking a presidential pardon for their son

Atkins expressed concern about the reports but did not commit to specific actions

Louisiana Republican Senator John Kennedy put SEC Chairman nominee Paul Atkins on notice during a Senate Banking Committee hearing on March 27, 2025. Kennedy demanded the SEC investigate the parents of disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.

The hearing marked Atkins’ nomination process as President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission. Kennedy used his five-minute questioning period to focus entirely on the FTX case and the role of Bankman-Fried’s parents.

“Every time you come to this committee, I’m going to pounce on you like a ninja to find out what the SEC has done,” Kennedy warned Atkins. “Because I don’t think the SEC’s done a damn thing.”

Kennedy’s concerns center on the alleged benefits received by Barbara Fried and Joseph Bankman, both Stanford Law School professors and parents of the convicted FTX founder. According to a complaint filed by FTX in September 2023, the couple received several valuable assets from the now-bankrupt crypto exchange.

These assets reportedly included a $16.4 million mansion in the Bahamas, $10 million in cash, and another $10 million donation to Fried’s “Mind the Gap” political organization. An additional $5.5 million was allegedly donated to Stanford University, where both parents taught.

“They’re crooks and I expect the SEC to do something about it,” Kennedy stated during the hearing. His forceful tone reflected frustration shared by many crypto industry observers and conservatives who believe Bankman-Fried received preferential treatment despite his 25-year prison sentence.

Atkins responded cautiously to Kennedy’s questioning. “Like you, I’m concerned about those reports,” Atkins said. “I look forward to getting to the SEC to find out what has happened.”

The nominee explained that he was not at the Commission during the FTX crisis in late 2022. He agreed to review the SEC’s work on investigating the involvement of Bankman-Fried’s parents when he takes office.

Pardon Rumors and Prison Developments Intensify Scrutiny

Kennedy also referenced reports that Bankman-Fried’s parents were seeking a presidential pardon for their son. “I read in the paper that the Bankman-Frieds were trying to get a pardon,” Kennedy said during the hearing.

The pardon reports emerged in January 2025, following President Trump’s pardon of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. According to William Livolsi, head of the White Collar Support Group, an SBF pardon seems unlikely due to the direct financial harm involved in the FTX case.

Bankman-Fried’s parents filed a motion to dismiss the FTX complaint on January 15, 2024. They claimed they were not FTX officers, were not employed by the exchange, and did not aid anyone in defrauding company clients.

The lawsuit against Bankman-Fried’s parents was dismissed without prejudice last month. This means the case can be reintroduced in the future.

Recent developments in the SBF case include an unsanctioned prison interview with Tucker Carlson in March 2025. Following this interview, Bankman-Fried was placed in solitary confinement and transferred from a New York facility to one in Oklahoma.

During the Carlson interview, Bankman-Fried claimed he had given money to Republican candidates “as much as Democrats.” He also hinted at becoming more conservative in recent years.

Kennedy’s line of questioning also touched on Stanford University’s role in the situation. He pressed Atkins about whether the SEC had investigated the $5.5 million donation to Stanford. In 2023, the university announced it would return these funds.

The hearing reflected broader conservative skepticism of elite universities. Kennedy emphasized his belief that “there should not be two standards of law and punishment for people in America.”

While Kennedy was the only senator to question Atkins specifically about the FTX crisis, the hearing generally broke along party lines. Republicans appeared pleased with Atkins, viewing him as more reasonable than his predecessor Gary Gensler.

Democrats raised concerns about Atkins’ role as an SEC commissioner before the 2008 financial crisis. Senator Elizabeth Warren questioned potential conflicts of interest arising from Atkins’ position as CEO of Potomak Global Partners, a regulatory compliance consultancy with clients overseen by the SEC.

Atkins has committed to divesting from his stake in Potomak within three months of his confirmation. The Senate Banking Committee is expected to approve his nomination, after which a full Senate confirmation vote will follow.

As the confirmation process moves forward, Senator Kennedy has made it clear he intends to hold Atkins accountable for investigating the Bankman-Fried family’s connections to the FTX collapse.",blockonomi

CoreWeave raised $1.5 billion in its IPO, pricing shares at $40 each

The company downsized its offering from 49 million to 37.5 million shares

Nvidia placed a $250 million order, strengthening its stake in the AI cloud firm

CoreWeave has a valuation of about $23 billion on a fully diluted basis

The company has deep ties to crypto through a deal with bitcoin miner CoreScientific

AI cloud company CoreWeave has completed its initial public offering (IPO), raising $1.5 billion by selling 37.5 million shares at $40 each. The company initially planned to sell 49 million shares at a price range of $47 to $55 per share.

The downsized offering comes amid what Bloomberg described as a “choppy stock market.” This resulted in a valuation of approximately $23 billion on a fully diluted basis, lower than the $35 billion valuation the company had initially sought.

CoreWeave provides access to Nvidia graphics processing units for artificial intelligence training and workloads. The company has positioned itself as a key player in the growing AI infrastructure space.

The New Jersey-based firm recorded nearly $1.9 billion in revenue last year. Despite this impressive figure, the company still reported a net loss of approximately $863 million to $900 million, highlighting the capital-intensive nature of its business model.

CoreWeave’s business requires heavy investment in equipment purchases and real estate expenditures. This has contributed to its current financial situation where high revenue is paired with ongoing losses.

Nvidia, which is already an investor in CoreWeave, placed a $250 million order in the offering. This move strengthens Nvidia’s stake in the AI cloud services firm and shows continued confidence in CoreWeave’s business model.

Growth and Challenges

The IPO represents one of the biggest tech offerings since 2021. It serves as a major test for tech startups and the venture capital market after an extended period with few new offerings.

The last venture-backed tech company that raised at least $1 billion for a U.S. IPO was Freshworks in 2021. Last year, Reddit and Rubrik each raised about $750 million in their offerings.

CoreWeave has strong ties to the cryptocurrency industry through a multi-billion dollar deal with bitcoin miner CoreScientific. This partnership aims to expand CoreScientific’s artificial intelligence capabilities.

Microsoft is CoreWeave’s biggest customer. Other clients include major tech companies like Meta, IBM, and Cohere, demonstrating the firm’s ability to attract high-profile business partners.

A week after filing to go public, CoreWeave announced a contract with OpenAI worth up to $11.9 billion over five years. As part of this deal, OpenAI agreed to buy $350 million in CoreWeave stock.

CoreWeave’s shares are set to start trading on the Nasdaq on Friday, March 28, 2025. They will trade under the ticker symbol “CRWV.”

Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, and Goldman Sachs & Co. are acting as joint lead bookrunners for the offering. These financial institutions are helping manage the public offering process.

CoreWeave is competing with some of the biggest tech companies in the world. These include Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, which are the three leading providers of public cloud infrastructure in the United States.

The IPO comes at a time when some AI-focused firms have seen weakness in their stock prices. Nvidia’s own stock price is down 12% since the beginning of the year, reflecting broader concerns about the AI sector.",blockonomi

OpenAI introduced rate limits after ChatGPT’s new image generation feature caused server overload

Free tier users will be limited to three image generations per day

The trend raised copyright concerns, particularly regarding Studio Ghibli’s distinctive animation style

Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki previously described AI-generated art as “an insult to life itself”

OpenAI has temporarily introduced rate limits for its new image generation feature in ChatGPT after a viral trend of creating Studio Ghibli-style images put too much strain on the company’s servers.

CEO Sam Altman announced the change on Thursday. “It’s super fun seeing people love images in ChatGPT but our GPUs are melting,” he posted on X (formerly Twitter).

this was a real labor of love from @gabeeegoooh. congrats gabe; excellent work! here is what we generated during the livestream: pic.twitter.com/fmHWp4d9AF — Sam Altman (@sama) March 25, 2025

The rate limits come just days after OpenAI launched its updated image generation tool. The feature was released on Tuesday as part of the upgraded ChatGPT-4o model.

Free tier users will soon be limited to three image generations per day. Altman did not say how long the restrictions would last but said he hoped it “won’t be long.”

The viral trend began when users started creating AI-generated images in the style of Studio Ghibli. The Japanese animation studio is known for films like “Spirited Away” and “My Neighbor Totoro.”

Users across social media platforms shared their creations. Many recreated scenes from movies, TV shows, and even political events in the Studio Ghibli style.

Viral Trend Reveals Both Power and Problems of AI Image Generation

Some of the most popular posts transformed well-known memes. These included the “distracted boyfriend,” “bro explaining,” and an image of Ben Affleck smoking.

Even Elon Musk joined in on the trend. The X and Tesla CEO shared an image that showed King Mufasa from Disney’s “The Lion King” holding up a Shiba Inu dog.

Altman himself was an early participant. He posted a Ghibli-style portrait of himself on March 25, just as the trend was taking off.

The company says rate limits help manage the load on its infrastructure. “If requests to the API increase dramatically, it could tax the servers and cause performance issues,” OpenAI explains on its website.

The viral images have also sparked discussions about copyright concerns. Many have questioned whether using Studio Ghibli’s distinctive art style violates copyright protections.

A 2016 video of Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki has been widely shared in response. In the video, Miyazaki describes AI-generated art as “an insult to life itself.”

Miyazaki, known for his hand-drawn animation style, says in the video: “I am utterly disgusted. If you really want to make creepy stuff, you can go ahead and do it, but I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.”

These concerns come shortly after nearly 4,000 people signed an open letter to Christie’s auction house. The letter called for the cancellation of an AI art auction over concerns about copyright and exploitation of human artists.

Despite these issues, OpenAI continues to expand its AI capabilities. Bloomberg reported on March 26 that the company expects to more than triple its revenue this year to $12.7 billion.

Altman said in February that his firm plans to release GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 in the coming weeks or months. These new versions will likely bring even more advanced AI capabilities.

The image generation feature is available to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users. Enterprise and Education users will gain access next week, according to OpenAI.

This isn’t the first time OpenAI has created image generation tools. The company launched DALL-E in 2021, which was one of the first AI image generators and was later integrated into ChatGPT in 2023.",blockonomi

DOJ seized approximately $200,000 in cryptocurrency (USDT) intended to benefit Hamas

Funds were traced from Hamas fundraising addresses that laundered over $1.5 million since October 2024

A group chat on an encrypted platform provided Hamas supporters with at least 17 cryptocurrency addresses for donations

Seized assets included cryptocurrency addresses valued at $89,900 and three accounts containing $111,500

The accounts were registered to Palestinian individuals living in Turkey and elsewhere

The United States Department of Justice announced on March 27, 2025, that it has disrupted a terrorist financing operation by seizing approximately $200,000 in cryptocurrency intended to benefit Hamas. The seized digital assets were in the form of USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin by supply.

Federal authorities traced the funds from Hamas fundraising addresses that were allegedly controlled by the organization. These addresses were used to launder more than $1.5 million in virtual currency since October 2024, according to the DOJ press release.

U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, Edward R. Martin Jr., emphasized the government’s commitment to cutting off funding to Hamas. “These seizures show that this office will search high and low for every cent of money going to fund Hamas, wherever it is found, and in whatever form of currency,” Martin stated.

The fundraising effort was coordinated through encrypted online communications. A group chat claiming association with Hamas operated on an encrypted platform to provide supporters worldwide with a changing set of cryptocurrency addresses.

Hamas supporters were encouraged to donate to at least 17 different cryptocurrency wallets. These donations were then funneled into a central operational wallet before being laundered through various means.

Tracing the Digital Money Trail

The laundering process involved a series of virtual currency exchanges and transactions. The operation leveraged suspected financiers and over-the-counter brokers to move the funds through the financial system.

Among the assets seized were cryptocurrency addresses valued at approximately $89,900. Additionally, three accounts containing cryptocurrency valued at approximately $111,500 were also confiscated by authorities.

The DOJ noted that these accounts were registered in the names of Palestinian individuals. These individuals were reportedly living in Turkey and other countries, though specific locations were not all disclosed.

Sue J. Bai, head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, reiterated the government’s approach. “At Attorney General Pam Bondi’s direction, the Department of Justice is committed to dismantling Hamas using every tool at our disposal,” Bai said.

FBI Special Agent in Charge Raul Bujanda of the Albuquerque Field Office highlighted the importance of financial measures in counterterrorism. “By successfully disrupting access to these funds, we have weakened their ability to function,” he stated.

Bujanda further explained the FBI’s stance on financial warfare. “This success demonstrates that financial warfare is a critical component to fight terrorism,” he added.

The case was investigated by multiple FBI divisions. The Albuquerque Field Office worked in coordination with the FBI Counterterrorism Division and Cyber Division to trace and seize the assets.

Several attorneys are handling the prosecution of the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Tejpal Chawla for the District of Columbia is working alongside Trial Attorney Jacques Singer-Emery from the National Security Division’s National Security Cyber Section.

Trial Attorney Jessica Joyce from the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section is also part of the prosecution team. The DOJ stated that the investigation remains ongoing.

This seizure is part of a broader effort to identify and disrupt Hamas’ attempts to use cryptocurrency for funding. Last year, the U.S. Treasury Department investigated $165 million in crypto transactions that allegedly supported Hamas before its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.

That attack resulted in the deaths of approximately 1,200 people, including 40 American citizens. The current seizure represents the government’s continued focus on cutting off financial support to terrorist organizations regardless of the form those finances take.",blockonomi

France’s state bank Bpifrance will invest €25 million ($27M) in cryptocurrency projects with “strong French footprint”

The bank will focus on DeFi, staking, tokenization, and AI-related blockchain projects

Bpifrance has already invested over €150 million in blockchain over the past decade

This initiative is supported by France’s Ministry of Economy and Finance

The bank cited increasing US crypto activity as motivation for strengthening France’s position

France’s state-owned bank Bpifrance has announced plans to invest 25 million euros ($27 million) in cryptocurrency and blockchain projects with a “strong French footprint.” The announcement came on March 27, 2025, during an event that brought together the French blockchain community.

The investment will focus on several key areas in the growing blockchain sector. These include decentralized finance (DeFi), staking services, tokenization platforms, and artificial intelligence projects built on blockchain technology.

This new initiative has received full support from the French Ministry of Economy and Finance. It represents part of a broader strategy to promote emerging technologies and strengthen France’s position in the global blockchain ecosystem.

Bpifrance has been active in the blockchain space for nearly a decade. The bank has already invested more than 150 million euros ($162 million) in blockchain projects and supported around 200 French startups in the sector.

One of the bank’s early investments was in Ledger, the crypto hardware wallet company, back in 2014. Ledger has since grown to become one of France’s most successful blockchain companies.

In 2022, Bpifrance began testing limited investments through tokens. This included deals with blockchain projects like Aleph.im and the DeFi lending platform Morpho.

France’s Growing Blockchain Ambitions

Morpho has experienced rapid growth since receiving this investment. It has become the 12th largest DeFi protocol by value, managing $3.24 billion according to DeFiLlama.

The global blockchain ecosystem is expanding quickly. It now includes more than 1,000 investment funds focused on digital assets, with a total market capitalization exceeding 2.7 trillion euros.

Despite this growth, Bpifrance noted that the number of French funds participating in this market remains limited. This new investment strategy aims to change that by encouraging more French players to enter the space.

Arnaud Caudoux, Deputy CEO of Bpifrance, explained the timing of the announcement. “The US is really accelerating its own crypto strategy, so this is all the more important,” he said during a press conference.

Caudoux added that Bpifrance had started supporting crypto before the United States began making pro-crypto moves. The bank wants to “increase French competitiveness and presence in the digital assets field.”

Clara Chappaz, France’s Digital and AI Minister, also stressed the importance of this initiative. She said that public and private financing is “one of the keys to the sustainable positioning of our ecosystem on the international stage.”

The investment approach will involve Bpifrance receiving tokens in return for its financial support. This model is common in venture capital deals in the crypto space, where investors often receive a portion of a project’s token supply.

PitchBook, a market research firm, expects crypto venture capital deals to exceed $18 billion this year. This marks a substantial increase from the $13.6 billion raised in 2024, showing growing interest in blockchain investments.

Bpifrance’s new crypto investment strategy is considered pioneering among sovereign funds worldwide. The bank views it as a way to gain deeper knowledge of asset tokenization and blockchain-based liquidity management.",blockonomi

Retail sentiment toward Ethereum is at extreme lows according to Google Trends data

ETH is currently trading at $2,007, consolidating below key $2,300 resistance

Technical indicators show mixed signals with some analysts predicting a breakout while others expect a drop to $1,300

Potential catalysts include Ethereum ETF approval, staking, and the upcoming Pectra update

ETH must break through $2,040 resistance to prevent further decline toward $1,980 support

Ethereum (ETH) currently finds itself at a crucial point in the market as retail investor interest hits multi-year lows. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap trades at $2,007, showing price stagnation that has kept many smaller investors on the sidelines.

Google Trends data reveals retail interest in Ethereum sits well below its previous peaks in 2017 and 2021. Cryptocurrency analyst Mister Crypto points to this metric as evidence of “extremely low” retail sentiment toward ETH.

This lack of retail enthusiasm could present buying opportunities for institutional investors. Historically, periods of low retail interest have preceded accumulation phases by larger market participants positioning themselves before price surges.

Despite current price struggles, several analysts remain optimistic about Ethereum’s prospects. Crypto analyst Ted highlights potential catalysts that could spark a breakout, including the possible approval of an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) with staking features.

The upcoming Pectra update represents another development that could help ETH regain momentum. These fundamental improvements to the Ethereum network may attract renewed interest from investors looking for growth potential.

Technical Analysis

Analyst Crypto Patel supports this outlook, noting that ETH appears to be consolidating within an accumulation range. Based on historical price patterns and on-chain data, Patel expects a breakout after April with an ambitious long-term target of $10,000.

Technical analysis from Titan of Crypto reveals a bullish crossover on Ethereum’s weekly Stochastic RSI. This indicator has historically marked market bottoms, suggesting ETH might be nearing the end of its bearish cycle.

#Ethereum Showing Signs of Bottoming The weekly Stochastic RSI bullish crossover in oversold territory has often signaled market bottoms for #ETH. pic.twitter.com/q62KmaRFqz — Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) March 26, 2025

Not all analysts share this positive outlook. Ali Martinez sees “no change in the outlook for Ethereum” and suggests ETH may still drop to around $1,300, representing the lower end of its current price range.

On-chain metrics present a more complex picture. The Market Value to Realized Value Z-score (MVRV-Z) indicates that ETH may be undervalued at current prices. This metric compares market value to realized value and typically signals potential accumulation zones.

For Ethereum to confirm a bullish reversal, it must overcome resistance at $2,300. A successful breakthrough could push ETH toward $3,000 in the near term, while failure might result in continued consolidation or further decline.

Short-term price action shows ETH struggling to maintain momentum above $2,020. The cryptocurrency faces immediate resistance around $2,040, with a bearish trend line visible on hourly charts.

If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,040 resistance, it risks another leg down. Initial support lies near $2,000, with stronger support established around $1,980. A break below this level could send ETH toward $1,880 or even $1,820.

The hourly MACD indicator shows weakening momentum in bearish territory. This technical signal, combined with an RSI below 50, suggests short-term pressure remains to the downside.

For a sustained recovery, Ethereum needs to break above $2,095 and then $2,150. Such a move would likely trigger additional buying, potentially pushing the price toward $2,250 or $2,320 in the coming weeks.

Ethereum’s current price action appears driven by a combination of weak retail sentiment and conflicting technical indicators. While some analysts point to undervaluation and potential catalysts, others see continued downside risk.",blockonomi

The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) plans to begin authorizing crypto firms in 2026 under a more stringent regulatory regime

Only 14% of crypto firms (50 out of 368) have passed the current anti-money laundering registration process

Coinbase recently secured FCA registration, allowing it to offer both cryptocurrency and cash services in the UK

FCA chief Nikhil Rathi expressed concern over young people investing in high-risk crypto before traditional financial products

The UK has seen increasing crypto adoption with 12% of adults now owning cryptocurrency, up from 10% previously

The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) intends to begin authorizing crypto firms under a new, more stringent regulatory regime in 2026. This marks a major shift in how digital assets will be supervised in the country. The current system primarily focuses on anti-money laundering compliance.

Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets at the FCA, revealed these plans in a recent interview. He described the upcoming framework as an “impending gateway regime.” This new approach will require even currently registered firms to seek fresh authorization.

The FCA has been selective in its approach to crypto registration so far. Of the 368 firms that applied for the current anti-money laundering register since 2020, only 50 have been approved. This represents a success rate of just 14%.

The new authorization process will be more comprehensive than the current system. It will cover a wider range of activities including stablecoins, trading platforms, and staking services. Companies engaging in these regulated activities will need specific permission.

Beyond AML: The New Crypto Oversight

Long indicated that the FCA will release several consultation papers this year. These will address stablecoins, trading platforms, staking, and prudential crypto exposure. The final policies are expected to be published before the regime goes live in 2026.

Speaking at the Treasury Select Committee, Nikhil Rathi said the FCA will always be anchored to our primary objectives to protect consumers, ensure market integrity and promote competition in the interest of consumers while also playing our role in supporting growth. pic.twitter.com/W09J901J7J — Financial Conduct Authority (@TheFCA) March 25, 2025

Stablecoin regulation will receive special attention in the new framework. “What we’re doing in terms of the stablecoins is we’re making sure that we take the best from the current regulation that exists in TradFi, but stablecoins are ultimately unique,” Long explained. The FCA plans to adapt existing financial regulations to fit this new asset class.

The transition process for currently registered firms remains undecided. Long suggested that even registered companies may need to go through another application process. This would be necessary if they want the “wider permissions” offered under the new regime.

The FCA is looking at international models as it formulates its approach. This includes examining Europe’s bespoke crypto legislation and the International Organization of Securities Commissions’ recommendations. The goal is to understand and implement global best practices.

While the regulatory landscape evolves, some crypto companies have already made progress under the current system. Coinbase, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently secured registration with the FCA. This achievement allows the company to offer both cryptocurrency and cash services to UK customers.

Keith Grose, Coinbase’s UK CEO, expressed enthusiasm about this development. “It opens up new channels and opens up the ability to launch new products and services,” he stated. The registration enables Coinbase to integrate fiat and cryptocurrency services more seamlessly.

Coinbase’s journey to registration wasn’t straightforward. In October 2020, the company entered into a voluntary requirement with the FCA due to concerns about its financial crime control framework. Despite these challenges, Coinbase eventually met the regulator’s standards.

The FCA’s approach comes amid growing crypto adoption in the UK. Recent findings show that 93% of UK citizens are now aware of cryptocurrencies, up from 91% previously. Furthermore, 12% of UK adults now own crypto, an increase from 10% in earlier surveys.

This rising interest has raised concerns among regulators. Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, recently expressed worry about young people’s investment choices. Speaking to MPs, he noted that too many Britons under 35 are making crypto their first investment.

Rathi described these investments as “very highly risky” and warned that investors could lose all their money. He advocated for more investment in traditional shares and bonds instead. “One thing I think is not great is the sheer number of under 35-year-olds for whom the financial product that they invest in first is crypto,” Rathi stated.

The FCA chief also noted that the UK has a “low level” of share ownership compared to countries like the US or Sweden. He attributed this to “a mix of tax, education, regulation and broader culture.” As part of its new strategy, the FCA aims to encourage more investment in equity or bond markets.

The regulator’s approach to crypto remains cautious. The FCA has repeatedly warned that crypto investments remain largely unregulated and high-risk in the UK. “If something goes wrong, it is unlikely you will be protected so you should be prepared to lose all your money,” the FCA stated last year.

Despite these concerns, the UK’s crypto ecosystem continues to develop. The 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis ranked the UK 12th in its overall ranking of countries. This suggests that despite regulatory caution, crypto adoption continues to grow.

As the 2026 target date approaches, crypto firms operating in the UK must prepare for more detailed oversight. Long emphasized that the FCA will communicate with firms about what the gateway will look like before it goes live. “Our intention is to bring it live as soon as humanly possible,” he added.",blockonomi

Bitcoin currently trading around $85,880, down 3.16% over the past month

Analyst Jamie Coutts predicts BTC could reach $123,000 by June in best-case scenario

Polymarket data suggests BTC could hit $138,617 by the end of 2025

$16.5 billion in Bitcoin options expire on March 28, potentially affecting short-term price

Despite recent volatility due to tariff concerns, Bitcoin has gained nearly 10% since dipping below $80,000

Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of recovery after months of uncertainty tied to U.S. trade tariffs and macroeconomic factors. Currently trading at around $85,880, down 3.16% over the past month, the cryptocurrency has bounced back nearly 10% since dipping below $80,000 earlier in March.

Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts believes Bitcoin will reach new all-time highs sooner than expected. “The market may be underestimating how quickly Bitcoin could surge – potentially hitting new all-time highs before Q2 is out,” Coutts told Cointelegraph.

Coutts based his prediction on easing financial conditions, a weakening US dollar, and increased liquidity from the People’s Bank of China since early 2025. Based on historical US Dollar Index (DXY) performance, he forecasts a range from a worst-case price of $102,000 to a best-case scenario of $123,000 by June 1.

When looking at this recent move in the DXY through a historical lens, its challenging to be anything but bullish.

This would represent a 13% gain over Bitcoin’s current all-time high of $109,000, which it reached on January 20. Coutts noted that “financial conditions have eased dramatically this month, highlighted by the US dollar’s third-largest three-day decline since 2015 and drops in rates and Treasury bond volatility.”

Data from Polymarket, a leading prediction platform, suggests BTC could hit $138,617 by the end of 2025—a 60% jump from today’s price. Crypto researcher Ashwin analyzed BTC price bets on the platform and found this ceiling represents “a market regaining its footing after tariff-related uncertainty.”

Technical Analysis

From a technical perspective, Bitcoin is testing a critical resistance zone near $88,000, aligning with its 50-day moving average. A breakout above this level could pave the way for a retest of its all-time high near $108,000.

Failure to hold support at $85,000 might trigger a pullback to $76,000—the yearly average that traders consider crucial for maintaining bullish momentum. Technical analysis also indicates that a bullish breakout has occurred above the descending trendline drawn along the lower highs since January 2025.

Multiple forecasts from major financial institutions support the possibility of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 again in 2025. JPMorgan predicts $145,000 with 3x Lightning Network growth, while Bloomberg Intelligence forecasts $135,000 if BTC reaches 20% of gold’s market cap.

More bullish predictions come from Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, who forecasts a $250,000 peak if the U.S. Treasury allocates just 0.5% of reserves to BTC. Standard Chartered predicts $200,000 due to $100 billion in ETF inflows by Q4 2025.

Bear case scenarios include BitMEX’s Arthur Hayes warning of a $70,000 floor if ETF outflows spike, and Glassnode tying a $74,000 price to long-term holder realized price. Despite these concerns, $100,000 sits comfortably within the base case predictions.

Bitcoin investors are now preparing for the record-breaking $16.5 billion monthly options expiry on March 28. The actual market impact may be limited, as BTC’s drop below $90,000 caught investors off guard and invalidated many bullish positions.

Currently, the total open interest for call (buy) options stands at $10.5 billion, while put (sell) options lag at $6 billion. However, $7.6 billion of these calls are set at $92,000 or higher, meaning Bitcoin would need a 6.4% gain to make them viable by the March 28 expiry.

For the options expiry, bulls hold a strategic advantage if Bitcoin remains above $86,500. In this scenario, only $2 billion worth of put options will be in play, compared to $3.3 billion in call options.

If Bitcoin can push above $90,000, the advantage for bulls increases substantially, with $4.4 billion in call options versus $1.4 billion in put options. This could create enough momentum to establish a bullish trend for April, especially if inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs resume at a strong pace.

Despite ongoing concerns about the global tariff war and US government spending cuts, Bitcoin bulls remain hopeful for a decoupling from the stock market. Their optimism stems from expansion of the monetary base by central banks and increased Bitcoin adoption by companies like GameStop, Rumble, Metaplanet, and Semler Scientific.

BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, recently suggested that Bitcoin will likely thrive in a recessionary macro environment. “I don’t know if we’ll have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for Bitcoin,” Mitchnick said in a March 19 interview.

Meanwhile, CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index is at 20, its lowest since January 2023, signaling a weak Bitcoin market with low chances of a strong rally soon. Based on historical performance, if the score remains below 40 for an extended period, it could signal continued bearish market conditions.

For traders and investors, watching the $88,000 resistance level and the outcome of the March 28 options expiry could provide important clues about Bitcoin’s next move. If Bitcoin can clear this resistance and hold above $90,000, the path toward retesting all-time highs becomes clearer.",blockonomi

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced USDT has surpassed 400 million users globally

Tether is open to creating a domestic US stablecoin amid regulatory changes

Tether has engaged a “Big Four” firm for a full audit of its finances

The company is diversifying beyond crypto through media and agricultural investments

Despite USDC’s growth, USDT still dominates with $357 billion in transaction volume versus USDC’s $207 billion

Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has reached a major milestone with over 400 million users worldwide, according to CEO Paolo Ardoino. This achievement marks a huge step toward the company’s goal of reaching one billion users.

The success comes as Ardoino envisions what he calls a “stablecoin multiverse.” He believes this new era will see hundreds of companies and governments launching their own stablecoins in the near future.

“A new era begins: the stablecoin multiverse. Hundreds of companies and governments are launching (or will soon) their stablecoins,” Ardoino wrote on X. He expressed pride in seeing massive adoption of technology that Tether created back in 2014.

A new era begins : the stablecoin multiverse. Hundreds of companies and governments are launching (or will soon) their stablecoins. I'm very proud to see such massive adoption of a technology that Tether created back in 2014 🙏 Good luck everyone ♥️ — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) March 27, 2025

This prediction follows news that Fidelity Investments is entering the stablecoin space. The move signals growing interest from major financial institutions in the rapidly expanding sector.

Fidelity’s digital assets division, which already handles Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, will lead this initiative. This shows how traditional finance is now embracing the technology.

On the regulatory front, Ardoino has opened the door to creating a domestic US stablecoin. “We are going to watch the bill for the requirements of the US domestic stablecoins and we would be open to create a domestic stablecoin in the US,” he stated on the “On the Brink” podcast.

He noted this would require a different business model. The US market is one Tether has not actively targeted before, making this a potential new growth area.

Tether’s relationship with regulators has been rocky. In 2021, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) ordered Tether to pay $42.5 million in fines over reserve disclosures.

The company has recently worked to improve its image. Ardoino noted on the podcast, “We work with the DOJ almost daily, and the Treasury.”

Tether now has a connection in the US government. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, previously Chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, has been a vocal supporter of Tether. Under Lutnick’s leadership, Cantor Fitzgerald began managing Tether’s reserves in late 2021 and acquired a 5% ownership stake.

In addressing long-standing questions about its reserves, Tether is working with one of the “Big Four” professional services firms. This full audit is a “top priority” according to Ardoino.

Earlier this month, Tether appointed Simon McWilliams as its new CFO. The new executive is expected to help facilitate this full audit.

Tether’s Strategic Expansion Beyond Crypto

Tether is also expanding beyond cryptocurrency. The company became the second-largest shareholder of Be Water, an Italian media company that controls Will and Chora Media. Tether secured a 30.4% stake following a €10 million capital increase.

This media investment gives Tether influence in digital content distribution. According to company statements, Tether plans to enhance digital content distribution and integrate new technological solutions.

The stablecoin issuer is also entering agriculture. Tether has a transaction agreement with Adecoagro S.A., a sustainable production firm in South America. The deal would have Tether acquire up to 70% of Adecoagro’s outstanding common stock at $12.41 per share in cash.

Adecoagro focuses on sustainable agricultural practices in South America. This investment represents Tether’s largest entry into conventional markets beyond financial technology.

Despite competition, USDT maintains its market dominance. According to Visa on-chain analytics for March 2025, USDT recorded $357.35 billion in transaction volume, far ahead of USDC’s $207.80 billion.

However, Circle’s USDC has been gaining ground. USDC recently hit a record market cap of $60.2 billion, surpassing its previous 2022 peak. Over the past three months, USDC expanded its supply by $16.6 billion compared to USDT’s $4.7 billion.

Ardoino has emphasized Tether’s grassroots approach to growth. “We always focused on the adoption from the ground up, working in the streets, among other people, while traditional finance was watching at us from their ivory towers,” he said.

This approach has helped USDT become a widely used tool for remittances, savings, and everyday transactions in countries with currency instability or limited banking access. Focus on practical use cases rather than institutional adoption has built Tether’s user base organically.

With the growing adoption of stablecoins, Tether seems well-positioned to maintain its leadership in what Ardoino calls the coming “stablecoin multiverse.”",blockonomi

SOL has been struggling to reclaim the $150 level for the past three weeks, facing an 8% rejection after briefly touching $147 on March 25.

Solana’s DApp revenues have dropped from $23.7 million to $12 million in just two weeks, while chain fees fell from $6.6 million to $3.6 million.

Technical analysis shows SOL forming a bearish falling wedge pattern with potential for a 12% drop to $120 if it breaks below the $136 support level.

Despite bearish indicators including the TD Sequential showing a sell signal, intraday traders are heavily positioned on the long side with $167 million in long positions.

Solana has lost its dominant position in DEX volumes to BNB Chain despite having 34% more total value locked.

Solana’s native token SOL is facing ongoing resistance at the $150 price level. The cryptocurrency experienced a sharp 8% rejection after briefly touching $147 on March 25. This pattern has persisted for three weeks now.

The rejection comes amid declining on-chain activity for the Solana network. Many traders are wondering if the bull market that was fueled by memecoin speculation and artificial intelligence sectors has reached its end.

Some market watchers believe SOL could still benefit from future developments. These include a potential spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the United States. The expansion of tokenized real-world assets on the Solana network is another possible catalyst.

Nikita Bier, co-founder of TBH and Gas startups, remains optimistic about Solana’s future. He believes the network “has the fundamental building blocks for something to break out on mobile.” Bier points to Solana’s streamlined onboarding experience for mobile users as a key advantage.

While the jury is not out yet, Solana has the fundamental building blocks for something to break out on mobile and certainly many apps are making headway. So today I’m joining @Solana as an advisor to help select companies launch & grow their apps. For a couple years I've been… — Nikita Bier (@nikitabier) March 25, 2025

The memecoin boom introduced millions of new users to Web3 wallets and decentralized applications. However, as the memecoin mania faded, on-chain volumes have plunged. This decline has made investors question whether SOL can return to levels above $150.

Solana is also facing growing competition from other blockchains. This competition has added to the pressure on SOL’s price. Market disappointment followed the realization that the US government would not purchase altcoins for its strategic reserve.

On March 6, President Trump signed a bill allowing the US Treasury to acquire Bitcoin. The legislation mentioned that altcoins in government possession could be strategically sold. There was no specific mention of Solana or any other altcoin in the Digital Asset Stockpile executive order.

The Solana ecosystem extends beyond memecoin trading and token launchpads. Total value locked (TVL) has grown across liquid staking, collateralized lending, synthetic assets, and yield platforms. Despite this growth, Solana’s fees and DApp revenues have continued to decline.

Recent data shows Solana’s DApp revenues totaled $12 million in the seven days leading up to March 24. This represents a sharp decline from $23.7 million just two weeks earlier. Similarly, base layer fees reached $3.6 million, down from $6.6 million in early March.

Solana has lost its position as the dominant network in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes. BNB Chain has surged to the top spot, despite having 34% less TVL than Solana. From October 2024 to February 2025, Solana dominated the DEX industry but has recently lost ground to Ethereum and BNB Chain.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis indicates SOL has formed a bearish falling wedge pattern. This pattern is similar to what Bitcoin is currently showing. At press time, SOL was trading near $137.5, reflecting a 4.76% price drop in the past 24 hours.

The price drop has brought SOL to the neckline of a bearish head and shoulders pattern. The neckline sits at around $136. Technical analysts suggest that if SOL closes a four-hour candle below $136, it could drop by 12%, reaching $120 in the coming days.

SOL has also faced rejection from a descending trendline that has acted as resistance since January 2025. This rejection, combined with the formation of a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern, strengthens the bearish outlook.

However, intraday traders appear to be betting against this bearish sentiment. Data from Coinglass reveals that traders hold $167 million worth of long positions at the $135 level. Meanwhile, $140 is another level where traders have built $83 million worth of short positions.

The bearish outlook could change if Solana breaks above the descending trendline. A daily candle close above $147.50 could potentially lead to a 22% rise, targeting $180 in the future.",blockonomi

SEC closed its investigation into Crypto.com with no enforcement action

Crypto.com had previously received a Wells Notice and sued the SEC in October 2024

The exchange withdrew its lawsuit in December following Trump’s election victory

Crypto.com remains the only major global crypto exchange not sued by or settled with the SEC

SEC has recently withdrawn several lawsuits against crypto companies under acting Chair Mark Uyeda

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially closed its investigation into cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com without taking any enforcement action. This decision marks a turning point in the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency companies in the United States.

Crypto.com announced the news in a blog post on March 27, 2025. The exchange had previously received a Wells Notice from the SEC, which is a preliminary notice that indicates the regulator is considering enforcement action.

In response to the Wells Notice, Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the SEC in October 2024. The exchange claimed that the regulatory agency had overstepped its authority in its approach to regulating cryptocurrency tokens as securities.

The lawsuit was later dismissed in December 2024. This dismissal came after Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election, which signaled a potential shift in regulatory approach toward the cryptocurrency industry.

Nick Lundgren, Chief Legal Officer at Crypto.com, expressed satisfaction with the SEC’s decision. “We are pleased that the current SEC leadership has made the decision to close its investigation into Crypto.com with no enforcement action or settlement,” he stated.

Lundgren criticized the previous SEC administration’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation. He claimed that the agency had “weaponized and attempted to expand its congressionally granted power” to harm the cryptocurrency industry.

A New Chapter in Crypto Regulation

Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, shared similar sentiments on X (formerly Twitter) on March 28. He described the previous administration’s regulatory stance as a “war on crypto.”

According to Marszalek, the previous administration tried to limit the industry’s growth. They did this by restricting access to banking services, auditors, and investors.

Crypto.com stands out as the only major global cryptocurrency exchange that has neither been sued by the SEC nor settled allegations with the regulator. This unique position highlights the company’s commitment to compliance.

The exchange maintains over 100 regulatory approvals worldwide. These include state money transmitter licenses in more than 40 U.S. states.

Crypto.com has also secured registrations with key U.S. agencies. These include the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

The SEC’s decision to end its investigation aligns with a recent shift in its approach under acting Chair Mark Uyeda. The agency has withdrawn lawsuits against several crypto companies in recent weeks.

These companies include OpenSea, Uniswap, Coinbase, Consensys, Robinhood, Gemini, and Immutable. This trend suggests a more lenient regulatory environment for cryptocurrency businesses.

The SEC has also established a Crypto Task Force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce. The task force recently announced plans to hold public roundtables on key regulatory topics in the coming months.

President Trump has nominated Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair. Atkins reportedly has a net worth of over $328 million, including up to $6 million in crypto-related assets.

Lundgren expressed optimism about working with the incoming SEC leadership. “Compliance and integrity are core to Crypto.com’s business, and we are excited to work with soon-to-be-confirmed Chair Atkins and the rest of the Commission on our long-awaited desire for legislation and rulemaking,” he said.",blockonomi

South Carolina has dismissed its lawsuit against Coinbase over staking services, joining Vermont

Eight other states including California and Illinois still have similar lawsuits active

Coinbase’s CLO Paul Grewal claims SC residents lost $2 million in staking rewards due to the ban

A new bill introduced in South Carolina could allocate up to 10% of certain state funds to Bitcoin

The Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Act would allow for a reserve of up to 1 million Bitcoin

South Carolina has dismissed its lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase related to staking services. The state’s Attorney General’s securities division officially dropped the case in a joint stipulation with the crypto company on March 27, 2025. This makes South Carolina the second state to withdraw such legal action, following Vermont’s similar dismissal earlier this month.

The lawsuit was part of a coordinated action by ten states filed on June 6, 2023. These states accused Coinbase of offering unregistered securities through its crypto staking services. Staking allows crypto holders to earn rewards by locking their assets to help validate blockchain transactions.

Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, celebrated the dismissal on social media. “South Carolina just joined Vermont to dismiss its unfounded staking lawsuit against Coinbase,” Grewal wrote on X. “This is not just a victory for us, but for American consumers and we hope it’s a sign of things to come.”

Grewal claimed that South Carolina residents lost an estimated $2 million in staking rewards as a result of the restrictions. The legal executive confirmed that staking services are now live again in South Carolina across all Coinbase platforms, including the app and website.

The original legal actions came on the same day the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed its own lawsuit against Coinbase. The SEC dropped its case against the exchange on February 27, 2025, potentially signaling a shift in regulatory approach toward crypto staking.

Eight states continue to maintain similar lawsuits against Coinbase. These include Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, Washington, and Wisconsin. All these states have claimed that Coinbase’s staking program needed to be registered under their securities laws.

The lawsuits argued that Coinbase’s staking service constituted selling unregistered securities. This was because users deposited crypto assets to validate transactions and received rewards, with Coinbase taking a percentage as a fee. Each state issued cease-and-desist orders under their respective securities regulations.

“The 52 million Americans who own crypto deserve commonsense consumer protections and clear rules,” Grewal stated. “We applaud South Carolina for standing up for justice and hope the remaining states with bans on staking will take notice.”

The Future of Crypto in South Carolina

In a separate but related development, South Carolina may be taking steps toward embracing cryptocurrency at a state level. On the same day as the lawsuit dismissal, state representative Jordan Pace introduced the “Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Act of South Carolina.”

Proud to file legislation that empowers SC to follow @realDonaldTrump’s lead to create a state level strategic crypto reserve. This gives the Treasurer new tools to protect taxpayer dollars from inflation https://t.co/JqUuBw243D — Jordan Pace (@Jscottpace) March 27, 2025

This proposed legislation would allow the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of certain state funds to cryptocurrencies. The bill specifically mentions Bitcoin multiple times, unlike most state crypto reserve proposals which use more general language.

If passed, the bill would permit South Carolina Treasurer Curtis Loftis to establish a Bitcoin reserve. This reserve would have a maximum capacity of 1 million Bitcoin – a ceiling that matches the federal government’s recently established Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

The treasurer would be able to add Bitcoin to various state funds. These include South Carolina’s General Fund and the Budget Stabilization Reserve Fund, as well as other investment funds managed by the treasurer’s office.

While Bitcoin is the main focus, the proposed reserve wouldn’t be limited to just this cryptocurrency. However, the bill makes no specific mention of other digital assets like stablecoins, Ethereum, or non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

This proposal is part of a growing trend across the United States. According to Bitcoin Law, 42 Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced at the state level across 19 states. Of these, 36 bills remain active, showing increased interest in cryptocurrency as a state-level asset.

The federal government has also shown interest in holding Bitcoin. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order creating both a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile. These federal reserves will initially use cryptocurrency seized in government criminal cases.

The simultaneous lawsuit dismissal and introduction of a Bitcoin reserve bill may signal a shift in South Carolina’s approach to cryptocurrency. The state appears to be moving from regulatory action against crypto services toward potential adoption of digital assets in its financial planning.

Coinbase continues its expansion efforts despite ongoing legal challenges in other states. The company has hinted at potentially acquiring crypto exchange Deribit and is preparing to re-enter the Indian market after receiving regulatory approval from India’s Financial Intelligence Unit.

As more states reconsider their stance on digital assets, the landscape for cryptocurrency in the United States continues to evolve. South Carolina’s dual actions – dropping legal challenges while proposing state investment – may serve as a model for other states looking to balance regulation with innovation in the cryptocurrency space.",blockonomi

We spent as much time together as we could, but when we weren’t physically together, we were in communication all day, every day. ￼ pic.twitter.com/d3IrQa9wLx — Bri Stern (@thebristern) March 28, 2025

According to media reports from TMZ and the LA Times, the lawsuit accuses Tate of sexual assault, battery, and gender violence. These alleged incidents occurred during what Stern describes as a 10-month relationship with Tate.

The model claims what began as consensual sex turned violent. In her account, Tate began verbally degrading, choking, and beating her during the encounter at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

Stern sought medical attention at a New York hospital following the alleged incident. Medical records obtained by TMZ show she was diagnosed with “Post-Concussion Syndrome,” suggesting she may have suffered a mild traumatic brain injury.

In her social media posts, Stern quoted Tate as allegedly saying, “Shut the fuck up, bitch. You will never backtalk me. You are my property.” This statement forms part of her claims about the verbal abuse she endured.

The lawsuit seeks unspecified statutory and punitive damages from Tate. Stern will be represented by Buzbee Law, one of the firms currently representing alleged victims of Sean “Diddy” Combs in separate legal matters.

Legal Representation and Police Response

Tate has not yet publicly responded to the allegations himself. His legal representatives from New York-based McBride Law told the LA Times that the lawsuit was a “blatant cash grab” meant as a “desperate attempt” to exploit their client.

The Beverly Hills police did not immediately return requests for confirmation or comments when contacted by media outlets. A digital copy of the lawsuit has not yet appeared in public records, making the full details of the allegations unavailable.

Stern’s SISTER token, which launched on the Solana blockchain in June last year, has seen a major price increase following news of the lawsuit. The meme coin surged by over 290% in the past 24 hours, reaching a market cap of $370,000 with approximately 550 holders, according to data from GeckoTerminal.

The total market cap of the SISTER token was previously reported at $103,365, with a price of $0.00001037 and a 24-hour trading volume of $811.79. Over the past two weeks, the token has experienced growth of over 12%.

Tate’s own crypto project, the DADDY token, has also seen price movements in recent weeks. The token briefly jumped 11% earlier this month when news broke about a separate criminal investigation against Tate in Florida.

This is not the first time Tate has faced serious allegations. The 38-year-old former kickboxer currently faces separate rape and human trafficking charges in Romania alongside his brother Tristan. They were allowed to leave Romania while awaiting trial on these charges.

In July 2024, Tate gave an interview with Rug Radio content creator Michael “ThreadGuy” Jerome. During this interview, Tate claimed that the degen culture behind crypto was “infantile, asinine,” despite promoting his own token.

Stern’s allegations have sent shockwaves across the cryptocurrency community. The lawsuit connects two worlds that don’t often intersect in legal proceedings – the emerging crypto meme coin market and allegations of physical assault.

The case highlights the growing overlap between social media influencers, cryptocurrency promotion, and real-world legal issues. As both tokens continue to trade, investors and followers of both parties await further developments in the case.",blockonomi

Sui and Polkadot have each focused on core improvements: throughput, interoperability, and developer ecosystems. Sui introduced parallel transaction processing, while Polkadot redefined how chains can work together.

Yet, BlockDAG is shifting the conversation. While it offers high performance and scalability, its roadmap extends into AI integration, decentralized governance, and self-sovereign identity—components critical to long-term relevance. As presale interest swells and technical milestones are hit, BlockDAG is positioning itself not just as a high-performance Layer 1 but as a future-ready infrastructure for Web3 and beyond.

Sui: Rapid Ascension in the Blockchain Arena

Launched in May 2023 by former Meta engineers, Sui introduced a Layer 1 blockchain emphasizing scalability and speed. Notably, its unique object-based model allows parallel transaction processing, enabling the network to handle over 4.58 billion transactions across 18.19 million active accounts as of January 2025. As a result, this design has attracted a diverse range of decentralized applications (dApps), expanding its ecosystem to 54 protocols by early 2025.



Furthermore, Sui’s DeFi sector has particularly flourished, with its Perpetual DEX recording a trading volume of $5.57 billion in January 2025, surpassing major competitors. Consequently, the SUI token has mirrored this growth, experiencing an 11.60% price increase over the past week, outperforming the global cryptocurrency market’s 1.70% rise. Therefore, early investors have seen substantial returns, with the token’s value appreciating significantly since its inception.

Polkadot: Pioneering Blockchain Interoperability

Polkadot, conceptualized by Dr. Gavin Wood, launched its mainnet in May 2020, aiming to facilitate interoperability among diverse blockchains. Specifically, by enabling multiple parachains to operate concurrently, Polkadot enhances scalability and fosters a collaborative ecosystem. As of now, over 50 parachains are active, reflecting robust adoption.



In addition, the DOT token plays a central role in governance, staking, and bonding within the network. Over 55% of DOT’s circulating supply is currently staked, indicating strong community engagement. Even so, despite market fluctuations, Polkadot’s emphasis on interoperability and continuous development positions it as a significant player in the blockchain space. Looking ahead, the anticipated launch of Polkadot 2.0 in Q1 2025 is expected to further enhance scalability and flexibility, potentially influencing DOT’s valuation positively.

BlockDAG Plans to Integrate AI, Governance & Identity Into Its Post-2026 Roadmap

BlockDAG isn’t limiting itself to transactional speed or decentralization—it’s setting the stage for a broader technological convergence. By contrast, by 2026, the team aims to go far beyond infrastructure, integrating artificial intelligence, decentralized governance, and self-sovereign identity systems into its ecosystem. Ultimately, this signals a shift from merely building a scalable blockchain to engineering a trustless digital society.



To elaborate, the vision includes decentralized AI protocols that operate transparently and securely on-chain, enabling intelligent automation without centralized control. Simultaneously, self-sovereign identity tools will let users own and manage their digital identities independently—key to unlocking secure DeFi, voting, healthcare, and more. Importantly, governance won’t be a bolt-on feature; BlockDAG is building mechanisms for token holders to influence protocol evolution directly.

Backing this vision, this ambitious direction is supported by strong momentum. The project has raised $208 million through its presale alone, without venture capital. It’s now in batch 27 of its presale phase, with the current price per BDAG token at $0.0248. Since its inception, early backers have seen a return of 2,380%, with over 18.9 billion coins sold to date.



As CTO Jeremy Harkness affirmed during Keynote 3, “We’re exploring new frontiers like AI, self-sovereign identity, data personhood, and decentralized governance.” BlockDAG’s roadmap doesn’t stop at mainnet—it aims to redefine what a Layer 1 network can be in a future where decentralization intersects with intelligence and autonomy.

Looking Beyond Transactions

Sui and Polkadot have proven their value by enhancing blockchain fundamentals—speed, scalability, and interoperability. Their ecosystems continue to mature, backed by strong development and community activity. However, the question is no longer just who can process more transactions or connect more chains. It’s who can build infrastructure for the digital realities ahead. BlockDAG is framing that answer with a broader vision—where AI, identity, and governance are part of the base layer, not optional extensions.

https://blockonomi.com,The Nation Token ($NATO) Officially Launches Following Historic Airdrop to 1 Million Users on Base,https://blockonomi.com/the-nation-token-nato-officially-launches-following-historic-airdrop-to-1-million-users-on-base/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 15:02:01 GMT","Iași, Romania, March 28th, 2025, Chainwire

74% of $NATO’s 1 trillion token supply was distributed in one of the largest airdrops ever — now trading live on Uniswap, AscendEX, and Poloniex

The Nation Token ($NATO), a decentralized token on the Base blockchain, has announced its official launch following a historic airdrop to one million active Base wallets. As of today, $NATO is trading live on Uniswap, Poloniex, and AscendEX.

In December 2024, 74% of the total 1 trillion $NATO supply — 740 billion tokens — was airdropped evenly to 1 million randomly selected Base wallets, with each wallet receiving 740,000 $NATO. This marks one of the largest and most distributed token airdrops in blockchain history. Uniswap liquidity has been locked until January 1, 2030, reinforcing the commitment to long-term decentralization. The contract address for $NATO on Base is: 0xd968196fa6977c4e58f2af5ac01c655ea8332d22

Why the Nation Token Was Created

$NATO was born out of a growing concern with the direction of many modern cryptocurrencies — specifically, the increasing trend toward centralization. From token allocations to liquidity control and governance influence, too many projects are dominated by a small group of insiders, leaving everyday holders with little to no say.

The Nation Token aims to break that pattern by creating a truly community-owned and community-governed asset, where every decision and milestone is driven by the people, aligning of its mantra of #PowerToThePeople. A governance platform is currently in final development to enable token holders to vote on proposals and roadmap decisions — completing one of the final pillars of $NATO’s decentralization framework.

Speaking about the recent listings of $NATO, Andrei Popescu, CMO said “This is a true experiment in decentralized financial empowerment, proving that the power of the people can shape the market like never before. Our goal is simple yet ground-breaking—to make $NATO the first token in history to reach high goals purely through collective effort.”

Momentum and Growth

Following its initial Uniswap listing (paired with WETH), $NATO saw growth in trading activity. In the two weeks following, both Poloniex and AscendEX listed $NATO (paired with USDT), resulting in a 10x increase in trading volume according to the team. Additional exchange listings are already in the pipeline.

To drive further awareness and participation, the team has launched a community growth campaign at https://taskon.xyz/TheNationToken

Participants can compete for a $1,000 USDC monthly prize pool, split among the top 50 leaderboard members, based on engagement and learning activities around the project. This gives a further incentive for both airdrop recipients, as well as new token holders to retain their tokens.

About $NATO – The Nation Token

The Nation Token is a decentralized community-owned token built on Base, that resulted from one of the biggest airdrops in the chain’s history, as 1 million wallets received a share of 740 billion tokens. The project focuses on fair distribution, transparency, and long-term community governance.

https://blockonomi.com,Ethereum (ETH) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Gear For Mega Returns By 2026,https://blockonomi.com/ethereum-eth-and-mutuum-finance-mutm-gear-for-mega-returns-by-2026/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 08:00:24 GMT","Ethereum is currently trading at $1,939 as technical indicators suggest cautious optimism with analysts forecasting a rise to $5,594 by late 2025. As ETH’s 4-hour chart signals a period of consolidation, its long-term role in decentralized applications underlies steady investor confidence. At the same time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) channels its way to its presale phase, accumulating 6,800 holders and $4.9 million.

At $0.02, Phase 3 is now almost 75% sold out, creating a rush ahead of the next 25% price rise to $0.025. For early adopters, the mathematics don’t lie: grab MUTM at today’s price, and you’re looking at a 200% boost when it hits exchanges in the $0.06 range; more speculation has it at $3.50 post-launch, a tidy 17,400% leap on its entry.

Ethereum’s Slow Climb Is Met With Whirlwind

Ethereum’s 24 hour trade volume at $11.54 billion evidence continuing interest regardless of bearish signals. The 50-day SMA ($2,438) is lurking above as a resistance, but 2031 forecasts of $58,140 keep ETH in the limelight. Its decentralized smart contract framework is unequaled, but it has exhibited price swings—13 percent volatility this month—that could put short-term traders at risk.

Despite the Fear and Greed Index remaining put at 31, long-term holders gambling on Ethereum’s programmability and scalability are undeterred by the recent price action. If ETH continues to accelerate net growth, it could crack $7,426 by 2026, but that slow climb is nothing compared to developing tokens constructed specifically for rapid, structured growth.

Mutuum Finance Presale Activity — What You Need To Know!

With Phase 3 reaching its final stages, all eyes are on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as it holds the crown for 2025 top crypto. More than 75% of the Tokens has been claimed – high demand before the next price increase Phase 4 will see a guaranteed 25% profit for investors joining now, but the real appeal is post-presale. In terms of tokenomics, this would peg the exchange listing of MUTM at $0.06, triple the current investments.

After launch, analysts correlate its value with practical utility: a decentralized lending protocol facilitating overcollateralized loans and mtTokens, transferable, interest-bearing assets transferable between platforms. MUTM’s buy-and-distribute approach, unlike speculative competitors, uses platform revenue to always buy and redistribute tokens to stakers. This drives sustained demand, a catalyst for the 2026 $3.50 target.

Engineered For Longevity Beyond The Fad

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) resists trendy concepts by rooting itself in defi access needs. Competitive yields for lenders are stirred up by the protocol’s dynamic interest rates, while borrowers gain access to liquidity without requiring them to liquidate assets. mtTokens, including mtETH or mtDAI, are compound value assets, which combine passive income with liquidity.

Having raised $4.9 million, the team made security a top priority finishing a Certik audit to ensure the smart contract is bug-proof and finally ensuring that the contract is secure is a requirement to ensure credibility that should pay off after the announcement. Dynamic token allocation also promises stability: 40% has been allocated for liquidity mining, 20% for partnerships, and 15% for exchange reserves, thus limiting post-launch volatility.

Timing the Next BreakOut of the Market

Though Ethereum will always have its legacy, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a rare opportunity with regards to affordability and foresight. Once the next tier comes into play, Phase 3’s $0.02 price is a fond memory, and the late arrivals are scrambling to enter at ever-higher entries. Not only do early participants enjoy immediate benefits, they set themselves up for a situation everywhere one must borrow and/or deposit, a fractional reserve system, will enhance MUTM’s scarcity.

With Phase 4 fast approaching, the window of maximum leverage is also closing. For investors looking for a 20,000x return by 2026, attention is slowly turning to MUTM, where growth is driven by mechanics rather than speculation.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sets to finish result of Certik audit. This transparency effort fits into its path toward becoming a DeFi mainstay. For those who are yet to do so, the third phase of the presale is still the cheapest entry point before algorithms and adoption take center stage.

https://blockonomi.com,XRP (XRP) Price: Analysts Forecast Rise to $10 Following Regulatory Clarity,https://blockonomi.com/xrp-xrp-price-analysts-forecast-rise-to-10-following-regulatory-clarity/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 09:14:29 GMT","TLDR

XRP has regulatory clarity after the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Ripple

Analysts predict XRP could reach $5-$10 in 2025, with some forecasting as high as $11

Potential catalysts include possible XRP ETF approval with an 87% probability this year

XRP may benefit from inclusion in the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile

Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD could boost XRP’s utility as a bridge asset

XRP’s price has been hovering around the $2.33 mark, showing a 4% drop in the last 24 hours. Despite this short-term dip, the cryptocurrency has made a strong recovery from its local lows in mid-March. Market watchers are now turning their attention to what might come next for this well-established digital asset.

Several crypto analysts have shared bullish predictions for XRP in recent days. Dark Defender, a well-known market commentator, believes XRP could eventually surpass both Bitcoin and Ethereum in market dominance.

The positive outlook comes primarily from XRP’s improved regulatory status. Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped its lawsuit against Ripple. These developments remove a cloud that had been hanging over the token for years.

XRP has been struggling to break through the $2.50 resistance level. There was a brief breakthrough last week, but the price failed to hold above this key mark. This pattern has led to a period of consolidation that some analysts view as a temporary pause before a major move upward.

Market Anaylsis

Analyst Mikybull Crypto compared the current price pattern to the one seen before XRP’s famous 2017 bull run. Based on this comparison, the analyst forecasts a price range of $5 to $10 for XRP during this market cycle.

Dark Defender offered an even more optimistic view. The analyst pointed to a bullish rectangle pattern in XRP’s recent price action that could lead to a surge in value. According to Dark Defender, XRP might reach $11 once the current consolidation phase ends.

Hi all, $XRP formed a great Bullish Rectangle Pattern ✅ This consolidation will be over very soon 🕜 The next leg will welcome new all-time highs. Tick Tock!⏰ Have an excellent day! pic.twitter.com/l8SUqxvQTR — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) March 27, 2025

Several factors could help drive XRP toward these price targets. One key catalyst is the potential approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Market expert Nate Geraci noted that an XRP ETF approval is becoming more likely, with data from Polymarket showing an 87% probability of approval within the year.

The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 opened doors for mainstream and institutional investors. A similar approval for XRP could bring a new wave of investment into the token. Major players like Bitwise and 21Shares filed for XRP ETFs late last year.

Another potential boost could come from XRP’s inclusion in the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile. This initiative, started through an executive order by President Trump, could further legitimize XRP in the eyes of institutional investors.

Ripple’s own stablecoin, RLUSD, launched in December, could also play a role in XRP’s growth. The stablecoin is appearing on more exchanges and aims to capture a portion of the $234 billion stablecoin market.

As RLUSD gains adoption, it could increase demand for XRP as a bridge asset for liquidity. This use case strengthens the token’s utility beyond simple value transfer.

While XRP draws attention for its potential growth, other tokens in the crypto space are also catching traders’ eyes. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL), an Ethereum-based meme coin, has raised over $4 million in its presale phase.

BTCBULL rewards its community when Bitcoin’s price rises and plans to airdrop real BTC to token holders when Bitcoin reaches certain price milestones, such as $150,000.

The token is currently priced at $0.00243 during its presale. Some traders expect it to see rapid price growth after it lists on exchanges.

XRP’s price movements in the coming months will likely depend on broader market conditions, regulatory developments, and progress on Ripple’s various initiatives. Whether it reaches the ambitious targets set by analysts remains to be seen, but the token’s fundamentals appear stronger than they have been in years.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,GameStop Stock Falls 22% After Bitcoin Acquisition Plans Announced,https://blockonomi.com/gamestop-stock-falls-22-after-bitcoin-acquisition-plans-announced/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 09:09:00 GMT","TLDR

GameStop’s short sales volume increased 234%, reaching 30.85 million shares

NYSE imposed a Short Sale Restriction after GME stock fell 22%

GameStop announced plans to purchase Bitcoin using proceeds from a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering

Short volume approached levels seen during the famous 2021 short squeeze

Analysts question the strategic value of GameStop’s Bitcoin acquisition plans

GameStop, the video game retailer at the center of 2021’s famous meme stock frenzy, is once again making waves in financial markets. The company’s recent announcement of plans to acquire Bitcoin has triggered a dramatic market reaction, including a steep stock decline and intervention from the New York Stock Exchange.

On March 27, GameStop’s short sales volume surged to 30.85 million shares, representing a massive 234% increase in just 24 hours. This level of short selling activity is approaching the 33.26 million shares seen during the historic January 2021 short squeeze that captivated financial markets.

The NYSE quickly moved to impose a Short Sale Restriction (SSR) on GameStop stock. This trading restriction automatically activates when a stock drops more than 10% from the previous day’s closing price and remains in effect for the rest of that trading day and the following day.

GameStop shares plunged 22% during the trading session, completely erasing the 12% gain the stock had experienced following its Bitcoin announcement. At the time of the reports, GME was trading at $22.09, its lowest level since October.

The selloff resulted in an estimated $3 billion loss in market capitalization in a single day. This sharp decline reflects deep investor skepticism about the company’s new strategic direction.

GameStop’s Crypto Pivot Sparks Market Backlash

GameStop did not specify exactly how much Bitcoin it plans to purchase. However, after markets closed on March 26, the company announced a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering, with proceeds intended for “general corporate purposes, including acquiring Bitcoin.”

Convertible notes are a form of debt that can later be converted into equity. Some analysts believe the announcement of this debt offering contributed to the stock’s decline, as it could potentially dilute existing shareholders’ stakes.

Han Akamatsu, a market analyst, drew parallels to Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), noting that when “MSTR issued $1.05B of 0% convertible notes, the stock dipped after the announcement due to hedging shorts, but later exploded when Bitcoin ripped and the arbitrage unspooled.”

Market experts have expressed doubts about GameStop’s Bitcoin strategy. Tom Sosnoff, founder and CEO of Tastylive, told Yahoo Finance that GameStop’s decision to buy Bitcoin feels “a little dot-comish” to him, comparing it to companies that added “.com” to their names during the internet bubble to attract investor interest without clear strategic justification.

Bret Kenwell, a US investment analyst at eToro, echoed these concerns, telling Reuters that “investors are not necessarily optimistic on the underlying business” of GameStop, calling into question the long-term viability of the Bitcoin pivot.

Kevin Malone, president and CEO of Malone Wealth, raised concerns about potential market manipulation, stating that “GameStop traded 50x more shares today than last Thursday. Not statistically possible without naked short-selling.”

The current short selling volume, while high, still falls short of the all-time record set on June 3, 2024, when it reached 46.20 million shares. That spike coincided with the return of Keith Gill, the stock trader known for his role in the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, who revealed he had resumed trading GameStop stock with $180 million.

From a technical analysis perspective, GameStop’s 22% intraday decline on huge volume indicates strong selling pressure and confirms a bearish trend. While the SSR might provide some temporary relief from additional immediate short selling pressure, the stock remains under pressure.

Key support levels to watch include the $20 mark, while any rebound attempts would likely face resistance in the $25-$27 range, which represents previous support levels that may now act as resistance.

The dramatic market response to GameStop’s Bitcoin plans highlights the uncertainty investors feel about this strategic shift. Critics are questioning its long-term viability, and the steep drop in market capitalization reflects the market’s pessimistic outlook.

GameStop now faces the challenge of convincing investors that its Bitcoin strategy is a sound decision that will ultimately benefit the company and its shareholders. The market will be closely watching how this story develops in the coming days and weeks.",blockonomi
