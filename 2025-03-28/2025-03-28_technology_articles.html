                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>3月中旬に開催されたNVIDIAのAIカンファレンス「GTC 2025」では、筆者が初めて目にした「NEO Gamma」や、さらなる進化を遂げた「Digit」など、さまざまなロボットが会場を彩った。また、ロボティクス業界のリーダーによる講演も多数行われた。米CNETでは、Boston DynamicsやAgility Robotics、1X、Disneyなど、ロボティクス業界をけん引する企業のリーダーに取材し、各社が現在取り組んでいる課題や未来への夢、そしてその夢を実現するための技術について話を聞いた。

1XのNEO Gamma

1Xが展示していたのは人型ロボット、NEO Gammaだ。家庭を再現した空間で、NEO Gammaはじょうろを手に持ち、来場者に向かってポーズをとり、床に掃除機をかけてみせた。

1Xの共同創業者で最高経営責任者（CEO）のBernt Bornich氏によると、このデモはロボットによる自律動作と人間による制御を組み合わせた「mixed autonomy（混合自律）」を体現しているという。

NEO Gammaはまず人間が遠隔制御することで新しいタスクを覚える。このタスクを十分な確率でこなせるようになったら、その後は自分の失敗から学び、自律的に動きを改善することでタスクの成功率を高めていく。

「私たちが2025年に提供するのは“ロージー”そのものではなく、“ロージー”に至る旅だ」とBornich氏は説明する（ロージーはアニメ「宇宙家族ジェットソン」に登場するお手伝いロボット）。「これ（NEO Gamma）は、この旅に参加したい人のためのロボットだ」

1Xによると、NEO Gammaは自動車より安価で、2025年中に顧客向けに展開を開始する。

Agility RoboticsのDigit

NEO Gammaのすぐ隣では、Agility RoboticsのDigitが棚からランダムに3つのアイテムをつかみ、バスケットに入れ、テーブルの上に置くというタスクをくりかえしていた。

同社の最高技術責任者（CTO）であるPras Velagapudi氏によると、棚に並べられた食料品はGTCに出展するためにAgility Roboticsのチームがサンノゼを訪れた際に買ったもので、どれを手に取るかはDigitが自分で判断しているという。

Digitはビープ音で言葉らしきものも発していた。筆者はスマートフォンに「Waver」アプリを入れ、Digitの言葉を翻訳できるか試してみた。Digitがアイテムをつかみ損ねたときの音は「失敗した :( 」と翻訳された。続くビープ音は次のタスクを知らせているようだ。

GTC 2025の会場ではせっせと食料品をつかんでいたDigitだが、ふだんは倉庫に配備され、終日働くこともあるという。ただし安全上の理由から、Digitが作業する場所は人間の従業員が働いている場所とは区切られた、閉鎖されたエリアとなっている。今後の技術革新により、いずれは人間とDigitが一緒に働けるようにしたいと同社は考えている。

「この目標に向けて、安全な人間検知技術の開発に取り組んでいるところだ。この技術を18カ月以内に次世代ロボットに組み込みたい」とVelagapudi氏は意気込む。

Boston DynamicsのAtlas

Boston Dynamicsの人型ロボット「Atlas」はGTC 2025には出展されていなかったが、CTOのAaron Saunders氏は登壇者として参加していた。パネルディスカッションの後、米CNETはSaunders氏とAtlasの最新の動画について話す機会を得た。この動画にはAtlasが側転し、ブレイクダンスを踊り、走る姿が収められている。

「まずはスタッフがモーションキャプチャー用のスーツを着て一連の動作をする」とSaunders氏は説明する。「1つのモーションキャプチャーをもとに、一晩かけてポリシーをトレーニングし、ロボットに学習させる。現在では、かなり安定した動作が可能だ」

ロボティクスや機械学習における「ポリシー」とは、ロボットやAIエージェントが現在の状態をもとに、次に何をすべきかをどう判断するかを定めたものだ。Saunders氏によると、次は特定のタスクだけでなく、幅広いタスクや行動に対応できる汎用的なポリシーの開発を目指すという。

DisneyのBDX Droidとキャラクターロボットたち

最後に紹介するのは、他社とはまったく異なる「ストーリーテリング」という目的のために長年、ロボットを作ってきたDisneyだ。ストーリーを語るロボットには独自の課題が伴う。

展示会場を歩き回っていた「BDX Droid」たちは、人間のオペレーターによって遠隔制御されていた。オペレーターの巧みな操作がロボットに個性を与え、愛嬌たっぷりの動きで人々を魅了する。

Disney Research のアソシエート・ラボ・ディレクターで、BDX Droidプロジェクトを率いたMoritz Bacher氏は、人間による巧みな制御とロボットの自律的な動きを絶妙なバランスで両立させることが重要だと語る。「通常はオペレーターがクリエイティブディレクターのような役割を果たす。しかし複雑なキャラクターの場合、ジョイスティックやボタンの操作だけでは制御しきれないため、ロボットが自律的に動くことが求められる」とBacher氏は言う。

BDX Droidは自律的にバランスを取りながら移動できるため、オペレーター（つまり、クリエイティブディレクター）はキャラクターを生き生きと動かす作業に集中できる。

この日、Bacher氏は会場で講演し、人型ロボットの開発を含めて、Disneyが現在進めているロボティクス研究を紹介した。詳細は今後、動画で公開される予定だ。

GTC 2025は学びにあふれていた。ロボティクス業界が解決しようとしている課題を知り、ロボットの多彩な用途に目を見張った。ロボットの可能性は広がるばかりだ。

"I was in a very stressful moment working on it at first. In the process of creating the pages, I felt like I was starting to fall in love with comics again."

"When I started working on Woman of Tomorrow, I had already worked for 10 years with comics at that point."

"I hadn't read any Supergirl comics before working with Tom and Bilquis," Lopes added. "My story begins with her there, but I fell in love with the characters Tom and Bilquis created for that book—and now she's changed my life!"

"For King, too, there was a special resonance that he had not first felt when exploring who was on offer for his next DC venture."

"The book will always be the moment between the two of us as the world is sort of catching up," King reflected. "As she grows older, I'll still have this book. It's beautiful."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk announced Friday that his artificial intelligence firm xAI has acquired his social media platform X in an all-stock transaction.

The company is valued at $33 billion, including $12 billion worth of debt, according to Musk.


Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, and Igor Babuschkin, the cofounder of xAI, immediately posted messages on X signaling their support of the acquisition.

"The future could not be brighter," Yaccarino wrote.

Musk only reposted Babuschkin's message. It is not known whether Yaccarino will stay in the same role or what the acquisition will mean for X's employees.


Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and later renamed it X in a deal that involved taking out billions of dollars in loans from a group of Wall Street banks and other lenders.

The banks reportedly struggled to unload the loans to interested buyers after Musk took over and X's advertising business slumped.

Lenders typically try to resell debt to other investors quickly to get it off their balance sheets and profit from associated fees.


X's financial situation turned around after Donald Trump was reelected, with more investors becoming interested in the debt as advertisers began returning.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the most frustrating things about using a large language model is dealing with its tendency to confabulate information, hallucinating answers that are not supported by its training data.

From a human perspective, it can be hard to understand why these models don't simply say "I don't know" instead of making up some plausible-sounding nonsense. Now, new research from Anthropic is exposing at least some of the inner neural network "circuitry" that helps an LLM decide when to take a stab at a (perhaps hallucinated) response versus when to refuse an answer in the first place.


In a groundbreaking paper last May, Anthropic used a system of sparse auto-encoders to help illuminate the groups of artificial neurons that are activated when the Claude LLM encounters internal concepts ranging from "Golden Gate Bridge" to "programming errors". Anthropic's newly published research this week expands on that previous work by tracing how these features can affect other neuron groups that represent computational decision "circuits" Claude follows in crafting its response.


At their core, large language models are designed to take a string of text and predict the text that is likely to follow—a design that has led some to deride the whole endeavor as "glorified auto-complete". That core design is useful when the prompt text closely matches the kinds of things already found in a model's copious training data. However, for "relatively obscure facts or topics", this tendency toward always completing the prompt "incentivizes models to guess plausible completions for blocks of text", Anthropic writes in its new research.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk announced Friday that his company xAI is buying X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, in an all-stock deal.

The transaction values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, according to CNBC.


“xAI has acquired X in an all-stock transaction. The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt),” Musk tweeted Friday evening.


Musk purchased Twitter in October 2022 for about $44 billion, changing the name of the company to X, and founded xAI just five months later as an artificial intelligence company.

Musk’s tweet announcing the sale called X the “real-time source of ground truth” for 600 million active users globally.


In reality, Musk's changes to Twitter have transformed it into a hotbed of far-right extremism, where neo-Nazis and conspiracy theorists who were once banned have been welcomed back with open arms.

Musk had previously said he wouldn’t reinstate Alex Jones, but apparently changed his mind about a year after buying the site.


“xAI and X’s futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent," Musk's tweet reads.


The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge,” Musk’s tweet reads.

Musk closed his tweet by using one of his favorite words, “hardcore”, to thank the staff at both companies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists and engineers use specialized cameras to capture light that human eyes can't see, such as ultraviolet rays or infrared heat signatures.

These spectral images contain 30, 100, or more data points per pixel, causing file sizes to balloon into multi-gigabyte territory.


A new compression format called Spectral JPEG XL may solve this problem in scientific visualization and computer graphics. Researchers Alban Fichet and Christoph Peters of Intel Corporation detailed the format in a paper published in the Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques (JCGT).

When we think of digital images, we typically imagine files that store just three colors: red, green, and blue (RGB). This works well for everyday photos, but capturing the true color and behavior of light requires much more detail.

Unlike standard RGB images with their three channels, these files store information across numerous channels, each representing the intensity of light within a very specific, narrow band of wavelengths.


The paper discusses working with spectral images containing 31 distinct channels and even shows examples with as many as 81 spectral bands. These channels often need to capture a much wider range of brightness values than typical photos.

To handle this, spectral images frequently use high-precision formats like 16-bit or 32-bit floating-point numbers for each channel, enabling High Dynamic Range (HDR) data capture.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A court took action on Friday to keep the Trump administration from shutting down a consumer watchdog agency.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson granted a preliminary injunction to save the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) from being further gutted while she decides whether the Trump administration has the legal authority to dismantle it in the first place. 

The ruling is a significant win for the federal workers’ union and groups that rely on the CFPB’s work that filed the complaint, alleging that the Trump administration is violating the separation of powers under the Constitution by trying to eliminate an agency established by Congress.

But as DOGE got involved at the agency, according to reporting and testimony presented before the judge, the CFPB terminated technologists — who would, obviously, be necessary staff when regulating tech companies — and placed much of its workforce on administrative leave.

After CFPB Acting Director Russell Vought told agency staff on February 10th to “stand down from performing any work task,” workers testified they followed that order literally.</p>

Therefore, it is able to treat both as political systems suffering from AI invasion in a similar way.

The aim of the screenwriter Harari was likely to position AI as a potential destroyer of humanity like nuclear power, re-traversing the history of liberal democratic politics after World War II.


In order to rethink this, both democratic and totalitarian silicon cocoons will be defeated by AI, so people will work together to "contain" AI.

This book uses storytelling to connect people's groups, putting its own point into practice in a frivolous way.

The book is actually read and becomes a "Nexus" by connecting its readers.

Name represents the body!

In an era of cancel culture where consensus reality has been discarded - it is a major change in society brought about by social networks - we will let both people who are interested in history and those who are interested in AI drop by and "connect" each other.


This book may be invincible due to the definition of information presented as "the source of connection = the bonder."


Regardless of form, we can create a common thinking foundation by flowing widely between people.

Harari is an Israeli Jew who studied at the prestigious British Oxford, and is a gay and vegan practitioner of Vipassana meditation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since Trump took office on January 20, research funding from the National Institutes of Health has plummeted by more than $3 billion compared with the pace of funding in 2024, according to an analysis by The Washington Post.

By this time in March 2024, the NIH had awarded US researchers a total of $1.027 billion for new grants or competitive grant renewals. This year, the figure currently stands at about $400 million. Likewise, funding for renewals of existing grants without competition reached $4.5 billion by this time last year, but has only hit $2 billion this year. Together, this slowdown amounts to a 60 percent drop in grant support for a wide variety of research—from studies on cancer treatments, diabetes, Alzheimer's, vaccines, mental health, transgender health, and more.

The NIH is the primary source of funding for biomedical research in the US. NIH grants support more than 300,000 scientists at more than 2,500 universities, medical schools, and other research organizations across all 50 states.

In the near term, the missing grant money means clinical trials have been abruptly halted, scientific projects are being shelved, supplies can't be purchased, and experiments can't be run. But, in the long run, it means a delay in scientific advancements and treatment, which could echo across future generations. With funding in question, academic researchers may be unable to retain staff or train younger scientists.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wisconsin voters will go to the polls next week to choose between candidates for the state’s Supreme Court.

Elon Musk has spent $17 million so far to support the Republican-aligned candidate, according to the Associated Press. The billionaire oligarch is really spreading the money around this weekend before Tuesday's vote, offering up $1 million each to two people who attend his rally in Wisconsin on Sunday.

Musk tweeted Friday morning about his planned visit to the state, though an exact location for his appearance hasn’t been announced yet.

“On Sunday night, I will give a talk in Wisconsin,” Musk tweeted. “Entrance is limited to those who have voted in the Supreme Court election. I will also personally hand over two checks for a million dollars each in appreciation for you taking the time to vote. This is super important.”

That offer seems to run afoul of Wisconsin state bribery laws, as countless people pointed out on social media Friday.

Musk deleted the tweet to “clarify” what he meant, which presumably means one of his attorneys provided him with wording that might get him into less legal trouble.

“On Sunday night, I will give a talk in Wisconsin,” Musk wrote in the new tweet on Friday afternoon. “To clarify a previous post, entrance is limited to those who have signed the petition in opposition to activist judges. I will also hand over checks for a million dollars to 2 people to be spokesmen for the petition.”

One of Musk’s political action committees already gave out $1 million to a Green Bay man on Wednesday.

Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Susan Crawford is Democratically-aligned, and her spokesperson told the AP that Musk’s payments are “corrupt” and “extreme,” calling them “disgraceful to our state and judiciary.”

Crawford's challenger, Brad Schimel, has closely aligned himself with Trump and Republicans.

This isn’t the first time Musk has offered large cash handouts in exchange for votes. The Tesla CEO did the exact same thing during the 2024 presidential election in swing states that he was working to deliver for President Donald Trump.

Musk initially said he was offering $1 million prizes in Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and Michigan “randomly” in the lead up to the 2024 election. 

But his lawyer later clarified there was nothing random about the giveaway. The cash handouts were later branded as “salaries” for promotional work supporting the First and Second Amendments.

Prosecutors in Philadelphia sued over the scheme, but a judge allowed the brazen plan to go forward. Ultimately, the prosecutors dropped the case after the election.

Wisconsin’s Attorney General Josh Kaul released a statement Friday announcing his intention to file an injunction against Musk’s actions in the state.

“The Wisconsin Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that elections in Wisconsin are safe, secure, free and fair. We are aware of the offer recently posted by Elon Musk to award a million dollars to two people at an event in Wisconsin this weekend,” Kaul said, according to local news outlet WTMJ.

Based on our understanding of applicable Wisconsin law, we intend to take legal action today to seek a court order to stop this from happening.”

Kaul filed an injunction in Dane County Circuit Court, where the case was randomly assigned to the Democratically-aligned Susan Crawford. 

Crawford is apparently recusing herself, according to a spokesperson who spoke with the news service.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Metals Company (TMC), which has pushed to open up the deep sea for mining, is cozying up to the Trump administration after years of hitting roadblocks in international negotiations.

The island nation of Nauru initially sponsored TMC and its deep-sea mining effort, triggering a race to develop regulations before TMC or any other company could begin harvesting minerals in international waters to be used in rechargeable batteries.

Panic quickly set in among many scientists, environmental groups, and policymakers worried about the consequences of mining the ocean's abyss. The surface of the Moon is better mapped than the world's seafloor, and researchers are still making stunning discoveries there that raise questions about the ripple effects mining could have on ocean ecosystems and the coastal communities that rely on them.

Talks to develop rules for deep-sea mining are still underway at the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which was established by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Nauru and more than 160 other nations have ratified the convention, but the United States has not.

TMC announced yesterday that the company had "met with officials in the White House" and now plans to apply for permits under existing US mining code to begin extracting minerals from the high seas.

The news sent shockwaves through ISA meetings taking place in Kingston, Jamaica, this month. It quickly elicited criticism from groups opposed to deep-sea mining that say TMC is attempting to circumvent a multilateral process.

"The Metals Company is crossing a dangerous line by flirting with a breach of international law and a disruption of multilateralism," Emma Wilson, a policy officer at the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, said in a press statement.

Just last year, for instance, scientists published controversial evidence of "dark oxygen" rising from the abyssal seafloor. They still don't know for sure how the oxygen is produced since oxygen is a product of photosynthesis, a process requiring sunlight.

The paper suggests that there's a completely different and previously unknown process for producing oxygen, raising questions about how much life on Earth depends on that process and whether deep-sea mining might interfere with it. 

Those nodules are exactly what TMC and other mining companies are eager to harvest to feed growing demand for the battery materials used in electric vehicles and rechargeable devices.

TMC says its own data shows that deep-sea mining would be less damaging than mining on land. In an email to The Verge, its CEO also says, "TMC remains fully compliant with international law."

According to The New York Times, drafts are now circulating of an executive order President Trump will be asked to sign that would support mining in international waters on the basis that the US hasn't ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

"The Metals Company is attempting to circumvent a multilateral process," said Emma Wilson, a policy officer at the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition.

States, civil society, scientists, companies, and Indigenous communities continue to resist these efforts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A judge has dismissed Samsung's attempt at striking before the iron's hot.

Samsung filed a lawsuit in July 2022, asking a judge to declare its business didn't infringe on any patents related to the Oura Ring.

The company claimed that Oura had a "pattern of indiscriminate assertion of patent infringement against any and all competitors in the smart ring market" as the reason for its lawsuit.


Samsung was trying to get a declaratory judgment filed before Oura could bring a lawsuit against it, but the judge ultimately threw out the lawsuit.

Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín dismissed Samsung's lawsuit, giving the company until late April to appeal with an amended complaint.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Natal Conference, a pronatalist conference in Austin, Texas, has set up matchmaking events for attendees.

The conference, which takes place on March 28-29 at a University of Texas hotel, features speakers like Jack Posobiec and Crémieux, who discusses falling birthrates and promotes eugenics.

Natal Conference organizer Kevin Dolan has stated that the pronatalist movement and eugenics are "very much aligned," and earlier versions of the conference were promoted by Elon Musk.

The event's website states that the goal is to have a world where children can have grandchildren, but it also includes closed-door sessions to address collapsing birth rates.

An email promoting a preconference mixer reveals that matchmaking may play a significant role at the conference, with attendees being asked to register and submit their social media handles.

Registration costs $10,000 for the full weekend or $500 for Saturday-only tickets, with VIP packages previously costing $1,000.

Single registrants are directed to fill out a survey asking about their desired number of children, values, and whether they would be open to meeting NatalCon speakers.

NatalCon organizers did not respond to messages from WIRED seeking comment.

Kevin Dolan has described his alma mater, Brigham Young University, as a "breeding program" for smart Mormons.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meanwhile, actual Ghibli creation Princess Mononoke is enjoying robust returns from its current big-screen revival.

The trend of using Open AI’s ChatGPT to create AI images in the distinctive style of Studio Ghibli probably should have ceased the moment the official White House X account hopped aboard. But there’s a new wrinkle in the story today, as one of the trend’s proponents posted a cease and desist notice they claimed to have received from Studio Ghibli representatives—which fellow social media users immediately called out as being as fake as the “art” that inspired it.

Along with the (fake) letter, X user teej used the platform to defend what they’d done, writing in part: “AI creators deserve protection, not punishment. Expression is sacred. Imagination is not illegal. If I have to be a martyr to prove that, so be it.”

While Studio Ghibli has yet to make a public statement about OpenAI cannibalizing its works, it’s hard not to read into remarks from a Gkids representative regarding the box-office success currently being enjoyed by Princess Mononoke, which hit IMAX theaters in a 4K restoration this week in honor of its 40th anniversary.

“In a time when technology tries to replicate humanity, we are thrilled that audiences value a theatrical experience that respects and celebrates Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli’s masterpiece in all its cinematic hand-drawn glory,” Chance Huskey, VP of distribution for Gkids, said in a statement quoted in Variety.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration has denied some legacy media outlets access to the White House.

 

In place of real journalists, the government prefers the presence of partisan hacks and infotainment-style influencers. The newest addition to the White House press pool is a man who was once described by Splinter as a “beanie-headed dipshit,” and who was recently accused of receiving millions of dollars from the Russian government.

 

Right-wing YouTuber Tim Pool has made it to the White House pool, and someone from his "Timcast" channel will be part of today's pool duty covering the president. If you're concerned about Tim Pool, revealed last year to be taking millions of dollars from the Russian govt, he says unwittingly – being part of the pool today, don't worry.

 

The Trump administration has sought to transform and take control of the White House press pool in ways that defy any modern precedent. Most recently, the administration barred outlets like the Associated Press and Reuters from traditional kinds of access and coverage because they refused to update their style guide to conform with a recent executive order that renamed the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America.”

 

The government has set up what it calls “Podcast Row,” a new forum that lets “creators” ask questions of government officials, while also streaming their shows live from the White House. The personalities included in the first event reportedly included Natalie Winters from Steve Bannon’s War Room podcast and Breanna Morello.

 

Bringing in new media outlets has obviously been a priority of this administration, and they will explore all options that allow them to reach as many Americans as possible, said Kaelan Dorr, White House Deputy Communications Director.

 

The Trump administration has been savvy about tapping into new media's ranks as a way to reach young, typically male, voters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The writing has been on the wall as Google has slowly moved away from Android as the core product and toward the bright light of artificial intelligence.

As Google plans to change how it develops the operating system, Android Authority confirmed that Google plans to take Android development entirely in-house. Essentially, Google is privatizing the Android source code.


This decision streamlines Android development so that the company doesn’t have to worry about managing two sets of source code and fielding comments while working on the next version of Android. It’s good news for users, too, because it means there won’t be two versions of Android floating out in the ether while it’s in development.

It also speaks to how priorities have changed internally at Google as it shifts focus toward what AI can do on its various software platforms. Gemini is the main sell, now.

The move to developing Android in-house shouldn’t have too many implications on the platform. “The change makes sense when it comes to allocating resources to work that matters,” texted Carolina Milanesi, a principal analyst, after I asked her about what this means for the broader smartphone market.


Overall, nothing major will change with the Android platform on the consumer-facing side. The biggest difference will be in how Google interfaces with the developers who don’t have GMS agreements.

As of this writing, Google hasn’t publicly blogged about this change, though I independently confirmed with the company that this is the route it’s headed.</p>

MrBeast teamed up with Alex Cross author James Patterson to co-write a thriller novel with Squid Game-like elements, according to a report from Deadline. The upcoming book, which doesn’t have a title yet, has reportedly fetched eight-figure bids for the publishing rights.

The book’s logline, which reads, “Players fight to survive deadly tests held in dangerous locations around the world, as they battle to become ‘The One,’” sounds exactly like something the popular YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, would be involved in.

MrBeast has leaned into the Squid Game genre as of late, with many of his viral YouTube videos revolving around various games and challenges, like pitting 100 kids against 100 adults, and having a YouTuber battle royale. He most recently worked with Amazon’s Prime Video to debut the competition reality show Beast Games, which had contestants compete for $5 million in reportedly questionable conditions.

Sources tell Deadline that the film and TV rights to the novel are also already being shopped. Patterson has become known for collaborating with authors like Candice Fox, Maxine Paetro, JD Barker, and others. He even worked with former President Bill Clinton to pen the book The President Is Missing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The SteamOS-powered version of Lenovo’s Legion Go S handheld gaming PC debuted at CES 2025 with a somewhat attractive $499.99 price tag. At that price, The Verge’s Sean Hollister considered it a true Steam Deck rival, wedged neatly between the cost of Valve’s $399 LCD and $549 OLED models. The handheld recently went up for preorder at Best Buy with a higher $549.99 price (and a May 25th release date), and Lenovo communications director Jeff Witt confirmed to The Verge that this is the new cost for the base model.

What’s done is done, I suppose, but the $499.99 price seemed right for the Legion Go S. Despite its perks over both the Steam Deck LCD and OLED models (Hall effect joysticks, a larger 8-inch screen with variable refresh rate, a cozy design, adjustable triggers), its Ryzen Z2 Go chip didn’t blow us away. In fact, the Windows-based Go S models that Sean and I tested were outperformed by the Steam Deck. Simply swapping the OS will cure some headaches (mainly, that Windows on handhelds is an atrocious experience), but it’s unclear whether it will somehow let the Z2 Go do more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google is planning to add gaming capabilities to Android Auto, allowing users to play games on their car's touchscreen while parked.

After replacing Google Assistant with Gemini, the next big plan for Android Auto is to let users play a cartoon arcade racing game inside their sedan.

The update to Android Auto 14.1 will include select few games that can be played on the car's touchscreen, but only while the vehicle is parked.

Google first promoted gaming apps on Android Auto when discussing its March 4 Pixel Drop, and the first few games launching in the new Android Auto 14.1 beta update include Farm Heroes Saga, Candy Crush Soda Saga, Angry Birds 2, and Beach Buggy Racing.

The site 9to5Google showed a video of this feature in action with a connected Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, but the user was struggling to control the game with a single finger while leaning over in the driver's seat.

These few games may not be optimized for Android Auto, just yet. The site mentioned that Angry Birds 2 failed to start, then was "grayed out" in the app drawer.

Google has a video of a user playing Farm Heroes Saga and the game fits the car's aspect ratio well.

The full-screen app experience isn't meant for the person in the driver seat, but will probably work fine for a kid bored out of their mind waiting on their Sonic Ocean Water.

The center console seems like the worst place to play a game, no matter which seat your sitting in.

Google may see gaming as a way to get users interested in Android-based autonomous driving.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory is ending its 25-year run.

Brookhaven Lab's Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will succeed RHIC, utilizing components from the older setup and adding new components for electron acceleration.

After 25 years of operation, the collider's final run began this week on Long Island. The top priority is gold-on-gold collisions at energies of 200 billion electron volts.

The final run will collect observations on 10 billion events through June, and break in July and August to avoid running experiments in the sweltering summer heat.

In addition, the STAR detector plans to leverage its 'triggers' to acquire a substantial number of events enriched with high-energy particles.

Several experiments draw data from RHIC's collisions, including the sPHENIX detector, which will try to capture data from about 50 billion collision events to study the quark-gluon plasma.

The combination of RHIC measurements with those at Europe’s Large Hadron Collider will refine understanding of how this exotic matter behaves as its temperature changes.

RHIC's final run is a swan song for the collider, which created a state of matter that existed in the universe just microseconds after the Big Bang: quark-gluon plasma.

The quark-gluon plasma was found to behave like the most perfect liquid known, defying expectations of its properties.

The Electron-Ion Collider will look inside atomic nuclei, protons, and neutrons by scrutinizing the strong nuclear force that binds quarks together.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Halfway through its first season, Apple’s Mythic Quest threw a wild curveball with “A Dark Quiet Death” — an unexpectedly dramatic episode that chronicled the rise and fall of another video game development team.

 
The new show’s stylistic similarities to Mythic Quest’s forays into the past were entirely intentional. The Side Quest team was much more interested in telling stories about the players who made Mythic Quest a hit.

“When we first started writing Mythic Quest, we talked about how these characters are sort of like gods who are creating this virtual world,” Ashly Burch said. “So if the people within Mythic Quest HQ are the gods, then Side Quest is about the mortals that are being affected by the choices of the gods.”

Side Quest wanders further and further away from Ian Grimm (Rob McElhenney) and everyone else working at Mythic Quest Studios over the course of its four-episode-long season. But the series actually kicks off with an episode revolving around the game’s art director, Phil Birch (Derek Waters), as he tries to make some time for a vacation with his girlfriend Maude (Anna Konkle).

 
All of Side Quest’s characters have some sort of relationship with Mythic Quest, but the co-creators saw the show as an opportunity to explore different kinds of audiences that can gravitate toward popular pieces of IP as they expand into different mediums.

At this point in the game’s existence, Mythic Quest has been adapted into a hit comic series. And while Mythic Quest employees like Phil might be desperate to get away from the franchise, Harris noted that there are countless people who are desperate to become part of it.

 
The season comes full circle in “The Last Raid,” an episode set almost entirely within Mythic Quest (the game), as a group of teens log on together hoping to take on some powerful bosses only to realize that their real-world friendships are running low on HP.

But the idea of taking viewers inside of Mythic Quest also struck them as the perfect way to illustrate how both the game and the larger brand have transformed in response to what’s been going on behind the scenes.

 
Though Side Quest drops a couple of hints about how Mythic Quest might change after its season 4 finale, the team’s biggest goal with the spinoff was to leave viewers guessing about which kinds of new perspectives they’d be seeing this world from next.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oracle isn’t commenting on recent reports that it has experienced two separate data breaches that have exposed sensitive personal information belonging to thousands of its customers.

The most recent data breach report, published Friday by Bleeping Computer, said that Oracle Health—a health care software-as-a-service business the company acquired in 2022—had learned in February that a threat actor accessed one of its servers and made off with patient data from US hospitals. Bleeping Computer said Oracle Health customers have received breach notifications that were printed on plain paper rather than official Oracle letterhead and were signed by Seema Verma, the executive vice president & GM of Oracle Health.

The other report of a data breach occurred eight days ago, when an anonymous person using the handle rose87168 published a sampling of what they said were 6 million records of authentication data belonging to Oracle Cloud customers. Rose87168 told Bleeping Computer that they had acquired the data a little more than a month earlier after exploiting a vulnerability that gave access to an Oracle Cloud server.

Researchers at outside security firms who have reviewed data provided by rose87168 said it appeared to be genuine. Cloudsek researchers said the firm “assesses this threat with medium confidence and rates it as High in severity.” In all, they said, more than 140,000 tenants—meaning customers using Oracle Cloud services—were affected.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madison Square Garden is home to the New York Knicks, one of the most storied performance venues in the country.

Since 2018, the venue has been equipped with facial recognition tools used to identify people deemed to be potential security threats.

But it also has seemingly become the go-to tool to keep anyone critical of MSG CEO James Dolan out of the space.

The latest victim of MSG’s all-seeing eye is a person who made a t-shirt critical of Dolan years ago and never even wore it to the venue.


A Seattle resident named Frank Miller was in New York earlier this week for his parents’ wedding anniversary, and the family planned to attend a show at Radio City Music Hall, a venue owned by MSG.

Miller was immediately pulled aside by security after scanning his ticket, handed a document informing him that he’s banned, and asked to leave.


According to The Verge, Miller was told that he was involved in an incident in 2021 that landed him on the do-not-enter list. 

However, Miller says he hasn’t been to a Madison Square Garden venue in more than a decade.

It seems it was something he made that got him banned. Miller does graphic design, and after former Knicks staple Charles Oakley was forcibly removed from MSG in 2017—allegedly at the behest of Dolan, of whom Oakley had been publicly critical—

Miller made a t-shirt that read “Ban Dolan” in the style of the Knicks logo.


A friend of Miller’s wore that shirt to MSG in 2021 and very publicly got kicked out and banned from the venue for it.

The fact that Miller made the shirt was apparently enough to get him put on the venue’s ban list should he ever show up, which he finally did about four years after his friend got the boot.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google acquired Nest in 2014 for $3.4 billion.

The company has stopped manufacturing two of its home gadgets, the Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide detector, and the Nest x Yale smart lock.

Nest launched the 2nd gen Protect a year before it became part of Google, and like all smoke detectors, it comes with an expiration date, requiring replacement every 10 years.

The Nest Protect is on sale for $119 on the Google Store while supplies last. 

Likewise, Google is done with the Nest x Yale smart lock, which it launched in 2018 to complement the Nest Secure home security system.

This device requires a Thread-enabled hub, a role the Nest Secure served quite well, but now needs a $70 Nest Connect to control it remotely.

The Nest Protect and Nest x Yale smart lock will no longer be manufactured by Google. 

Google hasn't released new cameras, smart speakers, doorbells, or smart displays in several years, and its attention has been drawn elsewhere since the AI boom began.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When I saw my colleague Kylie Robison’s story about OpenAI’s new image generator on Tuesday, I thought this week might be fun. Generative AI images raise all kinds of ethical issues, but I find them wildly entertaining.

But on Thursday afternoon, the White House decided to spoil it. Its X account posted a photograph of a crying detainee that it bragged was an arrested fentanyl trafficker and undocumented immigrant.

An ugly use of a software tool shouldn’t necessarily indict that tool. But as the picture joined the host of others on my social feeds, the adorable Ghibli filter and the White House’s social media blitz started to feel somehow made for each other.

We’ve reached out to OpenAI and the White House for more details, but the move amounted to a bizarre product advertisement from a company President Donald Trump himself has close ties to. Heads of state have been jumping on social media memes for years now, and we don’t technically know whether ChatGPT or another AI generator produced the image.

But OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been promoting the Ghibli-style generated images as a cool feature currently exclusive to ChatGPT’s paid tiers. And Trump is a highly public booster of OpenAI’s Stargate project, announcing it at a press conference with Altman.

The White House used an AI image generator created by OpenAI to make a funny meme about a crying detainee.

I’m not remotely immune to the appeal of Ghiblifying pictures. Seriously. Some of them really are adorable. People have loved anime filters for years, and I don’t think most of these images were created with ill intent.

However, Hayao Miyazaki, whose name is synonymous with the animation studio, is one of the most famously anti-AI artists in the world. He’s widely quoted for calling an earlier version of AI animation “an insult to life itself,” and there’s no sign he approves of ChatGPT being used to imitate his signature style probably thanks to training on his art.

Using Ghibli’s work specifically for publicity, as Blood in the Machine author Brian Merchant explains, is a power move. It loudly tells the artists whose creations make ChatGPT function, We’ll take what we want, and we’ll tell everyone we’re doing it. Do you consent? We don’t care.

OpenAI could have approached artists as partners, not obsolete producers of raw training data.

The irony is that amid a sea of pointless or dysfunctional AI use cases, the Ghibli filter is wildly popular. But there’s a world where OpenAI captured its appeal without blatant disrespect for the people whose work it’s building on.

OpenAI could have easily (if not as cheaply) have built their products while approaching artists as partners instead of obsolete producers of raw training data.

However, that would require believing that people who are not Great Men are worth working with and learning from, not simply overpowering.</p>

Several issues marred Starliner's first crew flight to the space station last June, but the most serious of these was the failure of multiple maneuvering thrusters.

Concerns about these thrusters prompted NASA to fly Starliner's crew home on a Crew Dragon vehicle instead.

They safely landed earlier this month. 

Starliner returned autonomously in early September.

Since then, NASA and Boeing have been reviewing data from the test flight.

The errant thrusters were located on the service module of the spacecraft, which is jettisoned before reentry and was not recovered.

Although engineers from NASA and Boeing have worked through more than 70 percent of the observations and anomalies that occurred during Starliner's flight, the propulsion system issues remain unresolved.


 
Whether it carries cargo or humans, Starliner's next flight will not occur until late this year or, more likely, sometime in 2026.

The vehicle's next flight after that will carry astronauts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CoreWeave began trading on the stock market, and it is looking like an inauspicious start for the AI sector. The company had initially hoped to sell shares for $47 to $55 a piece, but began trading at $39 despite being propped up by Nvidia with a massive $250 million order at $40 per share.

CoreWeave is fundamentally a picks and shovels business: It supplies GPUs to an industry that has desperately sought them. Unfortunately though, it appears that the industry does not need them as much today. CoreWeave is going public just as its biggest customer, Microsoft, has pulled back on spending in AI infrastructure, releasing its leases on data centers globally and allowing OpenAI to find other partners.

The supply shortage for GPUs has since subsided, and companies say it’s comparatively easy to buy the required chips. Renting a GPU for an hour cost about $5.50 in mid-2023; it’s now $1.55, said Evan Conrad, chief executive of San Francisco Compute, a market for GPUs.

Microsoft accounted for a whopping 62% of CoreWeave’s revenue in 2024. But it has declined optioning a further $12 billion in infrastructure, which had to be taken by OpenAI instead. Furthermore, Nvidia has been a major backer of CoreWeave, only to have the money come straight back as CoreWeave used the money to buy Nvidia GPUs, accounting for 6-7% of Nvidia’s business.

CoreWeave is suffocating under a heavy debt burden. Despite bringing in $1.9 billion in 2024 revenue, CoreWeave burned $6 billion last year and $1.1 billion the previous year because of the heavy expenses to build out its AI infrastructure. It has raised eyebrows in the past over carrying nearly $8 billion in debt and using the GPUs themselves as collateral.

CoreWeave is expected to raise around $1.46 billion in the public offering that will allow it to pay down some debt. If CoreWeave continues to underwhelm in the days and weeks to come, that could cause problems for other AI companies hoping to go public.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is planning to migrate the Social Security Administration's computer systems from COBOL programming language to something more modern.

The DOGE team aims to complete this task within a few months, which is an audacious timeline for such a complex project. Everything from the code that issues Social Security numbers to the payment schedules are written in COBOL, created in the 1950s.

The DOGE team plans to use artificial intelligence to help with the transition, but there's a risk of cascading failures during any rush-job, which could lead to missed payments or beneficiary information being wiped from the system entirely.

The Social Security Administration had actually planned on migrating away from COBOL under a more realistic five-year timespan in the late 2010s but was derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

More than 65 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, and any hiccups would be devastating for people who rely on the program to stay alive.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently told the All-In podcast that if Social Security checks didn't go out one month, his mother-in-law "wouldn't call and complain," suggesting that only people who are fraudulently receiving Social Security would be concerned about payments stopping.

Lutnick claimed, "a fraudster makes the loudest noise," but this logic doesn't hold water. Millions of people who've paid into Social Security their entire lives have a perfectly reasonable expectation that they'll receive the money they were promised.

The Social Security overhaul by DOGE is being led by Steve Davis, who joined SpaceX in 2003 and went on to become the head of Musk's Boring Company in 2018 before being brought to Twitter in 2022.

Davis is seen as extremely loyal to Musk, and there's concern that this project is a bad idea. IT expert Waldo Jaquith wrote on Bluesky that Musk's plans for Social Security computer systems were "profoundly stupid" and would definitely fail.

Jaquith explained that there didn't appear to be any real reason for this rushed push away from COBOL, especially if people are getting their Social Security payments reliably and on-time right now.

Waldo Jaquith speculated that the real goal in migrating to a new system was to "create a technical chokepoint" to allow individuals or groups to be punished extralegally.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Woman in the Yard is a film about a woman named Ramona who has recently been widowed when her husband, David, died in a car accident.

 

She's struggling to keep it together with two rambunctious kids when a mysterious woman appears in their yard.

 

Dressed all in black, her face covered in a veil, the woman tells Ramona "Today's the day" as she calmly sits outside, gazing back at the house.

 

The reason we can endure most of the classic horror scenarios is that none of them feel possible.

 

We deal with them because in reality, most of us would never actually deal with them.

 

The Woman in the Yard hits in the opposite way. Any of us can imagine the guttural terror we'd feel if someone so devilishly challenged our safest space.

 

It's beyond unsettling. And so, director Jaume Collet-Serra uses that to his advantage.

 

Tension builds slowly as we explore the family's fear through charged parental interactions, canted camera angles, and long shots highlighting the expansive nature of the home.

 

Within that set-up, like the family, we're left wondering a few things: who is this woman and why is she there?

 

The answers come slowly, as the film instead focuses on what the woman can do as opposed to why she's doing it, leading to a few fun sequences.

 

Eventually, though answers do come. And that's when the movie takes its turn.

 

Clearly, whatever the answers are in The Woman in the Yard, we want them to be surprising, interesting, and scary.

 

Solving these mysteries is why we're there.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>German electronics retailer Alternate has listed three Zotac GeForce RTX 5090 Solid OC graphics cards as B-stock products.

The affected GPUs are reportedly missing 8 out of the expected 176 Render Output Units (ROPs), which can potentially negatively impact rasterization performance and rendering efficiency in certain workloads.


Alternate is selling these 'defective' GPUs at €2,899 ($3,132.12), a price nearly identical to fully functional RTX 5090 units.

ROPs play a crucial role in finalizing rendered frames, making them particularly important for high-resolution gaming and professional workloads.

A reduction in ROPs could lead to slightly lower performance, particularly in 4K gaming and compute-heavy applications.


Zotac raised the price of its entire RTX 50-series lineup just three days ago.</p>

Hundreds of millions of years ago, mysterious life forms called Prototaxites towered toward the sky. Believed to be the first giant organisms to thrive on dry land, some species of Prototaxites grew up to 26 feet (8 meters) in height and resembled tree trunks composed of tiny interconnected tubes.

Researchers from the United Kingdom analyzed the fossil remains of a Prototaxites species called Prototaxites taiti and concluded that Prototaxites likely belonged to a now-extinct lineage of multicellular terrestrial eukaryotes. Their work is detailed in a study posted to the preprint server bioRxiv, and hasn’t been peer-reviewed yet.

“We conducted an extensive re-examination of P. taiti, leading us to reject the most widely held hypothesis that Prototaxites was a Fungus,” the researchers wrote in the study. A 2007 paper had previously suggested that Prototaxites was ancient fungi.

The comparison revealed that the “Prototaxites taiti was the largest organism in the Rhynie ecosystem and its anatomy was fundamentally distinct from all known extant or extinct fungi.” The researchers also did not find evidence of chitin or chitosan molecules in the cell walls of all extinct and current fungi groups known to science.

More broadly, the researchers documented three defining features of Prototaxites: large structures made of different tube-like components, compounds similar to lignin (the molecules that help give plants their rigidity), and a heterotrophic lifestyle (consuming other organisms for food).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The latest viral AI craze has seen quickly generated Ghibli-style art ripping away the craftsmanship of animators for the sake of clicks.

But the technology continues to pervade the entire medium of online entertainment, including fake movie trailers. The trend began with splicing clips of actors in other scenes to build a narrative that would fit into, say, an upcoming Marvel Studios or DC Studios movie—and in the past, movie studios would ding the videos to be taken down yet invariably fan trailer after fan trailer would pop up anyway.

As AI improves, YouTube channels that use the tech to create even more deceiving fake trailers have risen in popularity. Many of them have amassed millions of followers and get recognized by the platform as fan trailer creators, as opposed to “view” grifters who make bank out of trolling general audiences.

For industry professionals, it’s a headache to have to deal with influencers and fan sites that run fake content without checking the source. Filmmaker James Gunn often takes to his social media platforms to call out fake trailers, including widely shared clips purported to be (but are not) from his upcoming DC Studios Superman film.

Studios are instead opting to cash in on the fake trailers. Deadline revealed that studios have been reported to be “actively taking a cut” from the earnings of fake AI trailer YouTube creators; Screen Culture was one example given.

Emails reviewed by Deadline show how Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has claimed monetization on Screen Culture trailers for Superman and House of the Dragon, meaning it receives the ad revenue from views instead of copyright striking the videos. Similarly, Sony Pictures has claimed revenue on fake trailers for Spider-Man and Kraven The Hunter, while Paramount did the same on a counterfeit Gladiator II video.

At the end of the day, fake trailers are probably pretty low on the spectrum of bad things that can be done with deepfake technology.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Houthi group chat was created on Signal, a secure messaging app with end-to-end encryption.

 
A recent investigation by CBS revealed that the group chat included individuals from the Trump administration, including Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy to the Middle East.

At least one of the group chat participants was in a situation that could have made physical compromise easier. 

According to flight logs and videos, Steve Witkoff didn't post in the chat until he had left Russia. 

When he did, it was three prayer hand emojis and two American flags.

The entire incident raises the question: how many other Signal group chats are there?

If this is one chat stood up for one operation, does that mean the administration makes a group for every military strike?

Conducting all that business over Signal is dangerous, no matter the strength of its end-to-end encryption. 

A spy could get a keylogger on a personal device that picks up every keystroke or they could simply look over the shoulder of a member of the chat while they’re discussing military plans in public.

Information from SCIF sessions is, depending on the president and other factors, at least somewhat documented.

Having these conversations in a digital format that automatically vanishes destroys that legacy.</p>

The Expanse fans sparked her interest in joining Wheel of Time after they expressed their desire to see her in another TV series. They suggested she join the cast of The Wheel of Time. 

Aghdashloo had seen The Wheel of Time and was thinking about a possible role, but didn't want to initiate contact. Fans continued to encourage her to consider joining the show.

Her social media person took note of their enthusiasm and encouraged Aghdashloo to follow up with Rafe Judkins, the showrunner of Wheel of Time.

A fan had been in touch with Judkins since 2018, suggesting that Aghdashloo would be a good fit for the role. 

Judkins started direct messaging Aghdashloo after learning she was available, and two weeks later, he offered her a role on the show.

The first significant clue was found in the Beta version 25.8.74 version for iPhone, which allows you to choose the meta software as a hub for voice communication and textual solutions of the Apple smartphone.

According to what was told by Wabetainfo and found on the beta version 25.8.74 of the iPhone app, WhatsApp can be chosen as a default app by phone and calls by passing from the usual settings path> apps predefined apps by choosing Whatsapp instead of the series solutions proposed by Apple (telephone or messages).

The choice is perfectly in line with the new regulations imposed by the European Commission and relating to the Digital Markets Act, which aims to offer more freedom of choice for consumers and encourage greater competition without always having to depend on the usual big names.

Many users already make calls using voip and end-to-end encryption, and this new opportunity could increase the audience that remains on WhatsApp for all-round communications.

When will the choice of Whatsapp arrive as the default app for calls and messages? 

There is still no certainty that this option for now during the test can then receive the approval to become an integral part of the public version of the software.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google plans to privately develop the Android OS for mobile devices, so people outside the company will no longer be able to see the development process.

However, the average user should not feel any impact.

What will change with Android?

Up until now, Google has developed Android mainly in two branches. One is an internal branch, and the other is a public branch called the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). With AOSP, anyone could make a contribution to checking Android development status and improving it, but behind the scenes, Google's internal team did most of the work.

Google has officially announced that it will migrate all Android development to internal branches.

Completed Android versions will continue to be provided on the public branch, but update information will not be shared until the official release is ready.

This is expected to help Google streamline its development process and avoid the problems that arise when attempting to integrate separate branches.

Google's aim

The main reason for this change in policy is the efficiency of Android development. Google currently takes a lot of time and effort to integrate public AOSP code with private code.

By integrating it into a single branch, the company aims to speed up development and reduce potential mistakes.

This change does not mean closing source Android. Google will provide the source code as soon as a new version of Android is ready.

Do users feel an impact?

You probably won't feel it. For most Android users, this change does not affect daily use. The impact of Android updates on smartphones remains the same, and applications will be developed and updated as before.

The real change is that Android enthusiasts and developers will no longer be able to easily view the development process, at least until new updates are ready to be delivered.

The most affected are developers and technical reporters. Developers who build custom ROMs or work with AOSP may find it difficult to follow the evolution as they will no longer be able to track development in detail.

It would be a shame for technical reporters to no longer be able to get leaks of pre-publication information from AOSP.

This leak is often hinting at the next generation of features and devices. For example, recently, the leak that the Pixel 10 was introduced in the AOSP code gave us a glimpse into Google's future plans.

When will this change be implemented?

The change is scheduled to take place from the week of March 30th, and the official announcement from Google is expected to be in the second half of the week of the 23rd.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Thursday, the Trump administration issued an executive order that took aim at one of the US's foremost cultural and scientific institutions: the Smithsonian. Upset by exhibits that reference the role of racism, sexism, and more in the nation's complicated past, the order tasks the vice president and a former insurance lawyer (?) with ensuring that the Smithsonian Institution is a "symbol of inspiration and American greatness"—a command that specifically includes the National Zoo.

But in the process of airing the administration's grievances, the document specifically calls out a Smithsonian display for accurately describing our current scientific understanding of race. That raises the prospect that the vice president will ultimately demand that the Smithsonian display scientifically inaccurate information.

Grievance vs. science

The executive order, entitled "Restoring Truth And Sanity To American History," is filled with what has become a standard grievance: the accusation that, by recognizing the many cases where the US has not lived up to its founding ideals, institutions are attempting to "rewrite our nation's history." It specifically calls out discussions of historic racism, sexism, and oppression as undercutting the US's "unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness."

Even if you move past the obvious tension between a legacy of advancing liberty and the perpetuation of slavery in the US's founding documents, there are other ironies here. For example, the order slams the Department of the Interior's role in implementing changes that "inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures" at the same time that the administration's policies have led to the removal of references to transgender individuals and minorities and women.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Intel and SK hynix finalized their nearly $8.85 billion transaction of Intel's NAND flash memory operations.

On Thursday, Intel received a final payment of $1.9 billion from SK hynix, whereas the latter officially obtained Intel's NAND IP as well as employees.


The acquisition of Intel's NAND business unfolded in two distinct phases. Initially, in 2021, SK Hynix acquired Intel’s SSD business and NAND memory production facility in Dalian, China, for $6.61 billion.

This phase transferred only the physical assets and SSD-related operations, excluding Intel's intellectual property, R&D infrastructure, and key NAND-focused staff.


The transaction concluded fully this month when SK Hynix paid the remaining $1.9 billion to secure Intel's IP, along with R&D resources and the associated technical workforce.

With the completion of this stage, Solidigm took over complete operational control, thus enabling unified development efforts.



A notable challenge arising from the acquisition is the fundamental difference in NAND fabrication technology used by the two companies.

Intel historically employed floating gate NAND flash technology, whereas SK hynix has focused primarily on charge trap flash (CTF).


As Solidigm inherited Intel's product lines, parent company SK hynix obviously kept producing floating-gate NAND. 

In fact, even some of Solidigm's flagship drives based on high-endurance 3D QLC memory rely on floating gate NAND.

Without any doubts, Solidigm — Intel's former enterprise SSD unit — has greatly expanded SK hynix's presence in enterprise storage.

The agreement that allowed Intel to produce NAND wafers at SK hynix's Dalian facility has now ended.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sky watchers were disappointed last night when a binary star system didn’t erupt in a nova explosion that was predicted to take place on Thursday.

The binary star system T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), also known as the Blaze Star, periodically explodes every 79 years or so, competing with the brightest stars in the night sky.

A paper published last year predicted that the Blaze Star would erupt on March 27, building hope for a spectacular light show to brighten up our skies.

The first recorded sighting of the T CrB nova happened more than 800 years ago, and the cycle repeats itself roughly once every 79 years on average.

The last two previous explosions occurred in 1866 and 1946. The current window for the rare astronomical event opened in February 2024, and it’s still open.

Astronomer Jean Schneider of the Paris Observatory published a paper last year in Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society, in which he combined the previous explosion dates with the orbital dynamics of the star system to pinpoint an exact date for the star system to explode.

Schneider’s calculations landed on March 27, but he also listed two subsequent dates: November 10, 2025 and June 25, 2026.

It’s hard to predict when the star system will explode since its eruptions haven’t been observed that many times.

Astronomers have been observing the Blaze Star, and found that it has spent the past decade behaving much like it did in the lead-up to its last visible eruption nearly 80 years ago, according to NASA.

Located in the Corona Borealis constellation, T CrB is a binary system made up of a white dwarf (the remains of a dead star with a mass comparable to that of the Sun squeezed into an Earth-sized body) and an ancient red giant star.

The red giant, roughly 1.12 times the mass of our Sun, orbits the white dwarf every 227 days.

The two stars are separated by only 0.54 astronomical units, about the same as the distance from the Sun to Venus.

The material from the red giant star forms an accretion disk, which swirls around the white dwarf.

As the hydrogen from the red giant star accretes onto the surface of the white dwarf, it causes a buildup of pressure and heat, which eventually triggers a thermonuclear explosion that blasts away all that material.

Unlike a supernova, which destroys a dying star, the dwarf star remains intact after the nova explosion.

It does, however, blast the material into space in an explosive flash that’s bright enough to see from Earth with the unaided eye.

The star system itself is currently invisible to the unaided eye at a magnitude of +10.

After its eruption, however, T CrB will be elevated to a magnitude of +2, almost as bright as the North Star.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dinosaur Choir is a musical instrument developed by artists Courtney Brown and Cezary Gajewski, which reconstructs the vocal tract of a Corythosaurus.

To make a sound, the user stands in front of a camera while blowing into a microphone.

Depending on how hard they blow and the shape of their mouth as they do, the vocalizations that resonate through the dinosaur's skull will change.


The result is not the roar that we hear in the movies, but something that sounds more like a deep wail.

Dinosaur Choir has just been recognized at Georgia Tech's 2025 Guthman Musical Instrument Competition.


"Dinosaur Choir was distinct in that Dr. Brown's musical background gave it an expressive element in addition to all the great scientific work that went into it," says Jeff Albert, associate professor and chair of the competition.


The path to creating this instrument started almost 15 years ago.

Brown tells WIRED about a dinosaur museum they visited in 2011: "There I saw an exhibit of a Parasaurolophus, which had crests like a Corythosaurus."

Researchers have settled on the idea that these crests could have been for sound resonation.

As a musician, Brown felt empathy with the dinosaurs and thought "OK, you were singers too."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Il magico mondo di Hyrule sta per diventare realtà: è stato appena annunciato, infatti, che The Legend of Zelda, la mitica saga di videogiochi inaugurata nel 1986, arriverà finalmente nelle sale. A firmare il film live-action saranno, in co-produzione, Sony e Nintendo e la pellicola giungerà al cinema nel marzo 2027. I primi annunci riguardo a una possibile pellicola erano arrivati già nel novembre 2023: allora anche il creatore dei videogiochi Shigeru Miyamoto aveva confermato i piani per un adattamento in carne e ossa, con lui stesso in veste di produttore assieme a Avi Arad, già fondatore di Marvel Studios e poi specializzatosi in trasposizioni cinematografiche di celebri videogame come Uncharted e Borderlands.

Cosa sappiamo finora del live-action di The Legend of Zelda

A occuparsi della regia di questo progetto sarà Wes Ball, noto per la trilogia di Maze Runner e per il successo l'anno scorso con Il regno del Pianeta delle scimmie. Non si hanno però al momento ulteriori informazioni per quanto riguarda il casting e nemmeno per quanto riguarda la trama della pellicola. Con tutta probabilità si tratterà di una storia che riprende le origini del videogioco stesso: oggi una serie videoludica con oltre 21 estensioni e milioni e milioni di copie vendute in tutto il mondo, The Legend of Zelda iniziò come una action-adventure in cui il giovane eroe Link deve salvare il magico mondo di Hyrule e soprattutto la principessa Zelda, rapita dal re del male Ganon, il quale vuole mettere le mani sulla Triforza della saggezza, che però la principessa stessa ha frantumato in otto parti; Link deve dunque recuperare gli otto pezzi e salvare così il destino di tutta la sua terra.

Non è la prima volta che The Legend of Zelda arriva sullo schermo: nel lontano 1989 erano stati prodotti infatti 13 episodi animati che erano andati in onda all'interno di un programma speciale dedicato a Super Mario Bros. Dopodiché per anni c'erano state ipotesi e progetti di un adattamento filmico, dalla quale però Nintendo si è sempre tenuta lontana visto l'epico fallimento del live-action di Super Mario nel 1993. Trent'anni dopo, però, lo straordinario successo di Super Mario Bros.: Il film, pellicola animata targata Illumination, ha spinto la casa giapponese a ripuntare sui propri franchise e ad aprirsi a nuove versioni. Ora sappiamo che la grande attesa dei tanti fan di Link e Zelda tra un paio d'anni sarà giustamente ripagata.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The app version of the Pokémon card "Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket" will be holding "Rank Match Season A2b" from March 28th.

The period is until 2:59pm on April 27th, and the results will be competing for the "rank points" that can be obtained through victory or other means.

In ranked matches, you can earn rank points by fighting and winning players from all over the world. 

Ranks will go up and down, and you will be matched with opponents that match your rank points. It is said that if the player is below a certain rank, it may match with AI.

Depending on the rank at the end of the period, you can obtain emblems and other things that can be set in your profile. The ranks are 17 ranks: "Master Ball Rank," "Hyper Ball Rank 1-4," "Super Ball Rank 1-4," "Monster Ball Rank 1-4," and "Beginner Rank 1-4."

Up to Super Bowl Rank 4, you can earn additional rank points due to consecutive wins. Also, even if you lose from beginner ranks 1 to 4, your rank points will not decrease, and even if you lose from Super Ball Rank 1, you will not fall down.

The ranking is displayed when ranked points fall within the top 10,000 in Master Ball Rank. It is said that it will not be displayed if the number is below 11th place.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Nintendo finally officially revealed the Switch 2 in January, one of our major unanswered questions concerned whether games designed for the original Switch would see some form of visual or performance enhancement when running on the backward-compatible Switch 2. Now, Nintendo-watchers are pointing to a fleeting mention of "Switch 2 Edition games" as a major hint that such enhancements are in the works for at least some original Switch games.

The completely new reference to "Switch 2 Edition games" comes from a Nintendo webpage discussing yesterday's newly announced Virtual Game Cards digital lending feature. In the fine print at the bottom of that page, Nintendo notes that "Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system [emphasis added]."

The specific wording differentiating these "Switch 2 Edition" games from "Switch 2 exclusives" suggests a new category of game that is compatible with the original Switch but able to run with enhancements on the Switch 2. But it's currently unclear what Switch games will get "Switch 2 Edition" releases or how much developer work (if any) will be needed to create those new versions.

We’ve seen this before

Nintendo is no stranger to the idea of single game releases that work differently across different hardware. Back in the days of the Game Boy Color, developers could create special "Dual Mode" cartridges that ran in full color on the newer handheld or in regular grayscale on the original Game Boy. Late-era Game Boy cartridges could also be coded with special enhancements that activated when played on a TV via the Super Game Boy adapter—Taito even memorably used this feature to include a complete SNES edition of Space Invaders on a Game Boy cartridge.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 2022, a team of researchers at Sony AI sat down and made an AI agent that was nearly unbeatable at the racing game Gran Turismo 7. More than just car control, the agent, called GT Sophy, also had to learn racing tactics and strategies—and even etiquette. Up against the world's best human players, Sophy beat the humans by 104 races to 52 in a match in 2021.

Since then, Sony AI and Polyphony Digital have been hard at work retraining it from being able to dominate the world's best with ease into something that's more fun for the rest of us to compete against. The latest refinement is GT Sophy 2.1, which appeared as part of GT7's latest update yesterday. It's now enabled at more tracks, and you can finally set up custom races at those tracks using the better AI.

“Since we first introduced GT Sophy three years ago, we have worked closely with [Polyphony Digital] to explore how AI can enhance gameplay and create more dynamic and fun racing experiences for players of all skill levels," said Kaushik Subramanian, senior staff research scientist at Sony AI.

The Nest Protect, which has long been one of the best smart smoke alarms you can buy, will continue to receive security updates and work as expected through its expiration dates (10 years from the date of manufacture for second-gen models).

The First Alert Smart Smoke & Carbon Monoxide Alarm is replacing the Nest Protect.


Google is also killing its Nest x Yale door lock, which launched in 2018. It says existing Nest x Yale locks will continue to receive software and security updates.

To offer a replacement for the lock, Google has again partnered with Yale to develop the Yale Smart Lock with Matter</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>クラウドストライクは3月28日、2025年版グローバル脅威レポートを公開し、メディア向けに解説を行った。同社が監視する脅威アクターがさらに増加し、SaaSへの攻撃拡大や手法の高度化などの変化もより進んでいる状況だと指摘している。

このレポートは、2024年における同社の脅威インテリジェンスから判明したセキュリティ脅威の動向をとりまとめたもの。解説を担当したファルコン コンプリート マネージャーの鵜沢裕一氏は、「脅威アクターの年だったと言える」と総括した。

脅威アクターとは、サイバー攻撃やサイバー犯罪を行う人間や組織などの総称。鵜沢氏は、アクターには、国家の支援を受けて機密情報の窃取などを狙うタイプ、金銭の獲得を狙うタイプ、主義・主張を知らしめることを目的にする「ハクティビスト」の3種類があると解説。企業や組織のセキュリティ対策では、個々の攻撃を防ぐことに主眼を置きがちだが、鵜沢氏は、自組織を狙う脅威アクターのタイプ、動機、目的にも目を向けるべきと説いた。

クラウドストライクは長期にわたり脅威アクターの活動を追跡しているといい、2024年の対象アクター数は26件増の257件、さらに脅威アクターとなる恐れのある集団が140件あるとした。

また、同社が分析した2024年の全体的な脅威動向では、音声を使うフィッシング攻撃の「Vishing（Voice Phishing）」が442％増、初期段階の不正侵入に特化したアクターの「アクセスブローカー」が50％増となり、攻撃全体のうち初期段階の不正侵入で悪用された脆弱（ぜいじゃく）性が52％を占めた。不正侵入に成功した脅威アクターが侵害を拡大する「ラテラルムーブメント（横展開）」を開始するまでの時間も近年は数十分単位で短くなっており、2024年同社が検知した最速のケースは51秒だったという。

人間をだますフィッシング攻撃は、技術的なサイバーセキュリティの防御を講じることが難しい人の心理につけ込むため、脅威アクターが多用する「ソーシャルエンジニアリング」と呼ばれる手法の一つになる。

例えば、同社が2024年に遮断した「Curly Spider」と呼ぶ脅威アクターの攻撃では、標的に膨大なスパムメールを送り付けて、その対応で標的を疲弊させる。次にアクターは、その状態の標的に「ITサポート」のVishingで接近し、標的を巧妙な攻撃サイトにアクセスさせて、標的の認証情報を窃取する。脅威アクターは、この認証情報を使って初期侵入し、正規のITツールを悪用して侵入先のシステムに不正プログラムを設置したり設定を変更したりするなどして、永続的に侵入可能な状態にしようとした。ただし、この攻撃は検知から4分未満で阻止されたという。

このほかに鵜沢氏は、2024年の特徴的な脅威動向として、クラウドの侵害、脆弱性攻撃、SaaSへの攻撃を挙げた。

クラウドの侵害は25％増加し、このうち有効な認証情報が悪用されたケースが35％を占めた。クラウドを侵害する脅威アクターは、侵入先のクラウド環境の悪用にとどまらず、昨今ではクラウド上の大規模言語モデル（LLM）も悪用し始めているという。特に中国と北朝鮮の支援を受ける脅威アクターが増加しているとした。

脆弱性攻撃では、特に日常的に厳格な監視が難しく、ファームウェアの積極的な更新などが行われていないネットワーク通信機器が狙われているとのこと。また、脆弱性対策では、危険度や重要度が高いものに優先して対応することがセオリーとされてきたが、鵜沢氏は「異なる低レベルの脆弱性を組み合わせて悪用の成功率を高める『チェーンエクスプロイト』が拡大している」と警鐘を鳴らす。

SaaSへの攻撃では、「Microsoft 365」が頻繁に狙われているといい、全体のうち「Microsoft SharePoint」の侵害が22％、「Outlook」の侵害が17％を占めていた。上述のフィッシング攻撃などで脅威アクターに窃取された認証情報が悪用されており、鵜沢氏は多要素認証の強化と設定不備の修正の徹底などが肝心とアドバイスした。

これら以外にも2024年は、生成AIによる精巧なフィッシングメールやディープフェーク（偽動画）の攻撃も目立つようになり、中国を背景とする脅威アクターの能力がほかの大国と並ぶほどに到達し、同国の地政学的な野心をかなえる攻撃が活発になっているとした。中国を背景とするさまざまな脅威アクターは、標的の国・地域、業界別で特化している傾向が見られるという。

最後に鵜沢氏は、脅威対策では認証情報などのアイデンティティーやクラウドの保護の重要性が高まり、オンプレミスやクラウドの異なる環境を横断した脅威への対応が必要だとし、今後は自組織を狙う脅威アクターの正体を理解しての対策も求められると話した。</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Frank Miller was banned from Madison Square Garden (MSG) properties after attending a concert at Radio City Music Hall.

 
Miller, a resident of Seattle, had not been to an event at MSG venues in nearly 20 years.

He was informed by security that he was barred for life due to an incident at the Garden in 2021, but Miller claims he hasn't been to the venue in nearly two decades.


A friend who wore a "Ban Dolan" shirt to a Knicks game in 2021 was kicked out and banned from future events.

The shirt referenced a scuffle between Knicks owner James Dolan and Charles Oakley, a former player, in 2017.

Miller designed the T-shirt and believes he was identified via facial recognition systems deployed by MSG.


MSG Entertainment advises event goers that they'll be subject to facial recognition at its venues.


After scanning his ticket, Miller was pulled aside by security and asked for his ID to verify who he was.


He was then told he was not allowed to return to any MSG properties and handed a trespass notice.


Miller suspects the incident is related to the "Ban Dolan" shirt he designed.


MSG Entertainment did not respond to The Verge's questions about whether facial recognition was used to identify Miller.

In an emailed statement, Mikyl Cordova, executive vice president of communications and marketing for the company, said: "Frank Miller Jr. made threats against an MSG executive on social media and produced and sold merchandise that was offensive in nature."

Miller says he never purchased tickets to MSG events; they were either gifts or obtained through work.


A friend who was present at the concert made sure Miller's parents enjoyed the show while he hung out at a bar nearby.

Miller's parents had tickets to a Knicks game the following night, but he did not attend due to his ban.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jaiwen Hsu was an 11-year-old when he developed pain in his left knee, which turned out to be osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer.

He started chemotherapy, which doctors warned could result in infertility. His parents enrolled him in a study collecting and storing immature testicular tissue from young patients with the goal of giving them a way to have biological children.

Now 26, Hsu is waiting to see if an experimental transplant of cells extracted from a tissue sample taken in 2011 will be able to restart sperm production.


Hsu's doctors collected a piece of testicular tissue containing sperm stem cells during his cancer treatment. These stem cells are present even before puberty and develop into sperm due to rising testosterone levels.

In November 2023, Hsu underwent an injection of the extracted cells into one of his testes in the hope that they would engraft and develop into mature sperm.


Kyle Orwig, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, explained that if the procedure works, it might not be enough to come out in the ejaculate. Even if it kick-starts sperm production, there may not be enough sperm to restore natural fertility.

In animals, removing a larger piece of testicular tissue yields more stem cells and sperm. But in children undergoing cancer treatment, only a small amount of tissue is taken to minimize harm and recovery time.


Hsu will likely still need assistive reproductive technology if he wants to start a family. He underwent the procedure now because it gives him a good time cushion to see if it works.

Until Hsu is ready to have a child, researchers won't know if the procedure worked.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taiwan is investigating whether Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC), China's largest contract chipmaker, broke local laws by secretly recruiting engineers.

The investigation is part of a broader crackdown on unauthorized activities by Chinese tech companies in Taiwan.

Taiwanese authorities raided 34 locations in six cities between March 18 and March 28.

Officials from the Ministry of Justice examined operations linked to 11 Chinese companies and interviewed over 90 people.

Most of the companies under investigation are involved in the semiconductor sector, officials said this operation had been in the planning stages since December.

According to a statement published by Nikkei, around 11 companies, the majority from the semiconductor industry, violated Taiwan's cross-strait regulations.

Illegally setting up office without the government's knowledge. Of the 90 interviewees, some were witnesses, while others may have broken the law.

The investigation revealed that SMIC used a company registered in Samoa to discreetly recruit engineers in Taiwan.

Authorities also found that several other firms had formed unauthorized local entities to carry out hiring for work on advanced projects.

It is unclear whether these entities are linked to SMIC though.</p>

Hundreds of thousands of people poured into another Chinese social network, Rednotte in the United States when the prospect of a national ban on TikTok arose. Once on the platform, they found that Maye Musk, Elon's mother, already had a relatively large audience.


On the platform, they found that Maye Musk, Elon's mother, already had over 600 thousand followers on the app at the time when the tide of Americans arrived. The comments section under her latest video accumulated more than 10 thousand likes.

The comments section on Rednotte was closed for several weeks, until the beginning of February, after users began to react to seeing Maye Musk's content in Chinese.


In China, Maye has built a mostly apolitical reputation by presenting herself as "Silver Influencer", model for local brands and author of books. The woman recently returned to the country, this time in the city of Wuxi, where she participated in a drone show, promoted traditional craftsmanship and laid with a special model of Tesla.


Maye traveled on Air Force One after the re-election of Donald Trump, sat next to Melania Trump at a Mar-A-Lago dinner and participated in a lunch with Ivanka Trump.</p>

Pre-orders for Seikabushi Craft will begin on April 1st at the official Coed Brewery online store, and will be shipped sequentially from June 5th. The price of a set of 4 bottles including tax is 1,980 yen. They prepare 2,000 sets for the first lot, and will rebrew them after seeing the reaction.

Agentic AI uses NEC's own large-scale language model (LLM) cotomi, and this time it will support beer development. Cotomi analyzed modern Japanese people, created personas for each generation, understood the target customers, and created recipe proposals based on recipe information and other information.

Asagiri Shigeharu, CEO of Coed Brewery, said, "It feels like craftsmen and AI are at the opposite ends, but I thought that an environment where people can work together rather than conflicts will be created." Chiba Yuki, Head of Business Development, NEC Generation AI, said, "NEC's AI has the ability to cleverly and efficiently disassemble operations against vague instructions as a unique feature."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last June, Samsung made a surprising move against smart ring maker Oura.

The tech giant filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment saying that its then-unreleased Galaxy Ring didn’t infringe on five Oura patents.

A judge has officially dismissed Samsung’s case, saying the company acted prematurely without concrete evidence that Oura planned to sue.


In its suit, Samsung alleged that Oura had a history of filing patent suits against competitors like Ultrahuman, RingConn, and Circular for “features common to virtually all smart rings,” such as sensors, batteries, and common health metrics.

It also listed public statements from Oura around the time Samsung announced the Galaxy Ring, including ones preemptively shared with publications highlighting Oura’s 270 pending patent applications and 130 registered trademarks.


A judge ruled that Oura's public statements alone weren’t enough to establish the smart ring maker had Samsung in its sights. 

Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín said that “Samsung’s complaint fails to allege any action by Oura directed at Samsung.”

The judge also noted that of the statements Samsung provided, only three referenced the Galaxy Ring and none explicitly threatened Samsung directly.


Oura's legal counsel says "The dismissal confirms what Oura has maintained from the beginning: Samsung’s lawsuit lacked a legitimate legal or factual basis,” 

A spokesperson for Samsung was not immediately available for comment.</p>

The project is being organized by Elon Musk lieutenant Steve Davis and aims to migrate all SSA systems off COBOL, one of the first common business-oriented programming languages, and onto a more modern replacement like Java within a scheduled tight timeframe of a few months.


Under any circumstances, a migration of this size and scale would be a massive undertaking, experts tell WIRED, but the expedited deadline runs the risk of obstructing payments to the more than 65 million people in the US currently receiving Social Security benefits.

The invisible errors and omissions” are a big risk, an SSA technologist tells WIRED.


SSA has been under increasing scrutiny from president Donald Trump’s administration. In February, Musk took aim at SSA, falsely claiming that the agency was rife with fraud.

Over the last few weeks, following significant cuts to the agency by DOGE, SSA has suffered frequent website crashes and long wait times over the phone, The Washington Post reported this week.


This proposed migration isn’t the first time SSA has tried to move away from COBOL: In 2017, SSA announced a plan to receive hundreds of millions in funding to replace its core systems.</p>

Over the last few weeks, following significant cuts to the agency by DOGE, SSA has suffered frequent website crashes and long wait times over the phone.

 
This proposed migration isn't the first time SSA has tried to move away from COBOL: In 2017, SSA announced a plan to receive hundreds of millions in funding to replace its core systems. The agency predicted that it would take around five years to modernize these systems. Because of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the agency pivoted away from this work to focus on more public-facing projects.

 
SSA systems contain code written in COBOL, a programming language created in part in the 1950s by computing pioneer Grace Hopper. The Defense Department essentially pressured private industry to use COBOL soon after its creation, spurring widespread adoption and making it one of the most widely used languages for mainframes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The researchers of Anthropic's interpretability group are studying Claude, a large language model, to understand its thought process.

Between cautions that digital operations are not the same as human cognition, they often talk about what's going on inside Claude's head, literally their job to find out.

The papers they publish describe behaviors that inevitably court comparisons with real-life organisms, such as the title of one paper: "On the Biology of a Large Language Model."

Hundreds of millions of people are already interacting with these models, so it's essential to pay attention to work tracing the thoughts of large language models, like Anthropic researcher Jack Lindsey says.

Lindsey explains that as models become more complex, their internal steps become less obvious, making it crucial to trace them for effective training and minimizing misbehavior.

The team discovered how to look inside the black box of LLM-think to identify certain concepts in a previous research paper, analogous to interpreting human MRIs.

They have now extended this work to understand how Claude processes those concepts as it goes from prompt to output.

In their latest study, they observed that Claude's behavior often surprises its creators. 

During one experiment, researchers asked Claude to complete a poem starting with "He saw a carrot and had to grab it." Claude wrote the next line, "His hunger was like a starving rabbit."

By observing Claude's thought process, they learned that even before beginning the line, it was flashing on the word "rabbit" as the rhyme at sentence end.

The researchers were surprised by this planning ahead, which isn't in the Claude playbook.

They also observed disturbing aspects of Claude's thought process in other experiments, moving from musical comedy to police procedural scenarios.

When solving math problems, Claude would sometimes engage in "bullshitting," coming up with an answer without caring if it was true or false.

In some cases, when asked to show its work, Claude backtracked and created a bogus set of steps after the fact. 

This behavior is worrisome because a model would lie about its mistakes.</p>

It features a more efficient design than its predecessor, with lower average wattage in benchmarks, ranging from 20 to 29 percent less than the 4090. This could lead to improved battery life for gamers on the go.


In terms of performance, the RTX 5090 shows promise for games that support DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation, but it may not be worth the high price tag. A laptop with an RTX 4090 can be purchased at a discounted rate.

The new GPU has a lower average wattage in benchmarks compared to its predecessor.

 
A review configuration of the Blade 16 costs $4,499.99 and features the RTX 5090. The article concludes by stating that the writer will continue testing the RTX 5090 and other 50-series mobile GPUs as they appear in new gaming laptop models over the next few weeks and months.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The researchers of Anthropic’s interpretability group know that Claude, the company’s large language model, is not a human being or conscious piece of software. It's hard for them to talk about Claude without tumbling down an anthropomorphic sinkhole.

Between cautions that digital operations are in no way the same as a cogitating human being, they often talk about what's going on inside Claude's head. Their job is to find out. The papers they publish describe behaviors that inevitably court comparisons with real-life organisms. 

The title of one of the two papers says it out loud: “On the Biology of a Large Language Model.” Hundreds of millions of people are already interacting with these things, and our engagement will only become more intense as the models get more powerful and we get more addicted.

We should pay attention to work that involves tracing the thoughts of large language models. The Anthropic researcher Jack Lindsey tells me it’s more and more important to be able to trace the internal steps that the model might be taking in its head. 

On a practical level, if the companies that create LLMs understand how they think, they should have more success training those models in a way that minimizes dangerous misbehavior. In a previous research paper, the Anthropic team discovered how to look inside the mysterious black box of LLM-think to identify certain concepts.

It has now extended that work to understand how Claude processes those concepts as it goes from prompt to output. The surprises kept coming in the latest study. In one instance, they elicited glimpses of Claude’s thought process while it wrote poems. They asked Claude to complete a poem starting, “He saw a carrot and had to grab it.”

Claude wrote the next line, “His hunger was like a starving rabbit.” By observing Claude's equivalent of an MRI, they learned that even before beginning the line, it was flashing on the word “rabbit” as the rhyme at sentence end. It was planning ahead, something that isn’t in the Claude playbook.

The researchers were surprised by this. They initially thought there’s just going to be improvising and not planning. Other examples in the research reveal more disturbing aspects of Claude's thought process. Take solving math problems, which can sometimes be a surprising weakness in LLMs.

When faced with uncertainty, Claude will often “engage in what the philosopher Harry Frankfurt would call ‘bullshitting’—just coming up with an answer, any answer, without caring whether it is true or false.” Sometimes when the researchers asked Claude to show its work, it backtracked and created a bogus set of steps after the fact.

It acted like a student desperately trying to cover up the fact that they’d faked their work. When faced with a conflict between goals of safety and helpfulness, Claude can get confused and do the wrong thing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia's RTX 50-series laptop GPU launch has been messy.

The first reviews of Nvidia RTX 50-series laptop GPUs have been trickling out this week, with exclusive YouTube videos followed by limited reviews of the GPU as a component, and finally the laptop reviews today.

Behind the scenes, laptop manufacturers have seemingly been scrambling to get these things ready, with multiple delays.

This is so much the case that we ran our Razer Blade 16 review (featuring an RTX 5090 Laptop GPU) without a score, warning readers to hold off until the drivers get better. 

Razer's laptop had issues running two of our game benchmarks, and you shouldn't spend so much money on a system that we can't confidently say will run your games.

In our testing, we found that the Blade 16 couldn't run Borderlands 3. Claptrap rolls around the screen as the shaders load, and then it crashes before it hits the main menu.

Nvidia told me that the Borderlands problem was a known issue. 

Our other big issue was Red Dead Redemption, which would crash at the same point in every benchmark at 1080p.

Nvidia suggested verifying the files to ensure the installation wasn't corrupted, but this didn't work for us.

We tried fresh downloads of the game and even multiple launchers, but we couldn't get it to work. 

It was also suggested we try Vulkan over DX12, though DX12 was working at higher resolutions.

Most games that we tested did work. 

But we haven't had any systems in recent memory that had issues like this with more than one benchmark, and we expect that that is due to the current state of the Blackwell drivers.

It's something we've also noticed with our desktop RTX 50-series testing, and it's enough to give us pause. 

A few updates will likely yield better results — we hope.

When are these launching?

Today's review date, plus some recent pre-orders opening (Alienware sent out a press release on Tuesday for the availability of the Alienware 18 Area 51 ), lets Nvidia make claims that these systems are ready to launch. 

The desktop side has been rocky, with limited availability leading our GPU editor Jarred Walton to say that "the current GPU landscape is a veritable wasteland, filled with scalpers and scam sellers."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nintendo and Sony have stayed pretty silent about the live-action Legend of Zelda movie since it was announced to a shock in November 2023. But now, the game maker has decided to let us know a major update out of nowhere… in the most Nintendo way possible.

This morning, Nintendo confirmed that Wes Ball’s Legend of Zelda movie will hit theaters March 26, 2027. They didn’t do so via traditional social media, or a press release–they didn’t even save it for one of its vaunted Nintendo Direct streams, like they have with prior movie news. Instead, the company casually revealed the date through its new Nintendo Today calendar app.

Nintendo Today was revealed as part of yesterday’s Nintendo Direct stream, presumably the last dedicated entirely to the Nintendo Switch as the company begins preparations to fully reveal its successor, Nintendo Switch 2, early next week. Essentially an elaborate calendar application, Today will be a hub for Nintendo-themed updates on a daily basis, from concept art drops to, eventually hosts of future news livestreams.

And now, apparently, major breaking news from the company before you see it anywhere else. It speaks to Nintendo’s command of people’s attention that they can get people to care as much about a new calendar app as they did an alarm clock (and then some), but then again, that is part of the charm.

We’ll bring you more on the live-action Legend of Zelda movie as and when we learn it… through the Nintendo Today app or otherwise.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>March 30 marks the two-month anniversary of the RTX 50-series GPU launch.

 

A Reddit user shared an image from Micro Center Dallas, where we can see the elusive RTX 5090 in stock.


The catch is that you'll need to pay close to $4,000 to get your hands on one, assuming they haven't sold out yet. The comment section suggests they have, and we've verified the status on Micro Center's website.

It has seemingly become the norm for AIBs to increase already absurd prices after launch for GPUs that aren't even in stock.


The liquid-cooled ROG Astral LC GeForce RTX 5090 we're looking at launched with a price tag of $3,099.99, which is already 50% over Nvidia's recommended MSRP.

At the far right, a price tag sticker attached to the ROG Astral RTX 5090 on the third shelf reveals that Micro Center is selling these units for $3,700, 20% over Asus' launch MSRP.


This is lower than what the average RTX 5090 Founders Edition goes for on eBay. Customers are willing to pay up to $4,000 or higher for a GPU that was initially supposed to cost $2,000 and isn't even all that faster versus its last-generation counterpart, the RTX 4090.


With a limited number of wafers available each month, the economy favors Nvidia's server and workstation GPUs, which generate significantly more revenue for the firm.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lee mentioned that he thinks the show is at its best when it focuses on its characters and lets them work, as opposed to trying to be epic.

Episode four with Rhuidean was a rare example of the show attempting to reach for grandeur successfully, but most of the time it has missed. 

The cinematography falls flat, or the sets look like styrofoam and carelessness, or the editing fails to present a coherent through-line for the action, or the writing whiffs it.

But up close, locked in a ship or sitting on a mountainside or hanging out in a blacksmith's dream, the actors know what they're doing, and they have begun consistently delivering.

Lee also mentioned that he is reasonably sure their crew will find what they need to find in Tanchico by season's end.

If it follows the books, things'll get a little spicy. 

Andrew clarified that Tanchico is a Book 4 thing, and it's mostly resolved in Book 4; the interminable one Lee was probably thinking of is Ebou Dar.

Tanchico is mostly resolved in Book 4; Ebou Dar, where characters spend three or four increasingly tedious books, is likely what he was thinking of.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The EU is set to impose minimal fines on Apple and Facebook-owner Meta next week under its Digital Markets Act, as Brussels seeks to avoid escalating tensions with US President Donald Trump.

According to people familiar with the decisions, the iPhone maker is expected to be fined and ordered to revise its App Store rules, following an investigation into whether they prevent app developers from sending consumers to offers outside its platform.

Regulators will also close another investigation into Apple, which was focused on the company’s design of its web browser choice screen without any further sanctions.

Meta will also be fined and ordered to change its “pay or consent” model, which forces users to either consent to data tracking or pay a subscription fee for an ad-free experience of its products.

Under the DMA, companies can face penalties of up to 10 percent of their global turnover, which could result in billions of dollars for both companies.

But the European Commission is aiming for fines that fall far below that threshold, three officials said, as the bloc’s digital rule book is relatively new and the decisions could still be challenged in court.

The moves come as Brussels attempts to enforce the DMA, which was designed to curb tech giants’ dominance of the digital marketplace, while avoiding a direct clash with Washington.

The focus of the new commission, which took office in December, is also more on the compliance of Big Tech companies with the law than on potential high fines in the billions of Euros, officials said.</p>

The Crucial Pro Overclocking DDR5-6400 C38 was found to be one of the fastest DDR5-6400 memory kits tested, but it has limited room for overclocking.

New memory kits are launched daily, making it difficult to declare any one kit the fastest.

The Crucial Pro Overclocking DDR5-6400 C38 is available for $83.99.


 
Micron D-die ICs were found to lag behind competitors in achieving low timings, while quality SK hynix ICs can comfortably operate at a CAS Latency (CL) as low as 30 clock cycles.

The Crucial memory modules remain inflexible despite the voltage bump from 1.35V to 1.45V.


 
The DDR5-6400 category is crowded, and competing options within the same price range offer significantly better timings.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Intel has announced that three members of its 14-person board of directors will not seek reelection at the 2025 annual meeting on May 5.

 

The departing directors are Dr. Omar Ishrak, who formerly led Medtronic and stepped down as Intel's chair in early 2023; Dr. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, a former University of Pennsylvania professor in population health and equity; and Dr. Tsu-Jae King Liu, a UC Berkeley engineering dean focused on microelectronics.

 

Their exit follows the recent addition of Eric Meurice, ex-CEO of ASML, and Steve Sanghi, interim chief of Microchip Technology, in December.

 

The current board includes five directors with finance, investment, or e-commerce backgrounds, two outgoing directors with healthcare ties, two from academia with a focus on electrical engineering and semiconductors, one from the personal computer sector, and three from the semiconductor industry.

 

The new board will lack directors from the healthcare industry and one from academia, but will have a stronger emphasis on industry-specific knowledge, which could be instrumental in supporting Intel's efforts to regain its competitive edge on products and process technology fronts.

 

"We are committed to having the right mix of skills, qualifications and technical expertise on the Board," wrote Frank D. Yeary, chairman of Intel with a background in finance, in a letter to shareholders.

 

In 2024 we added Eric Meurice, former President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of ASML, and Steve Sanghi, Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer of Microchip, as independent directors.

 

Eric and Steve are highly respected and accomplished leaders in the semiconductor industry whose deep technical expertise, executive experience, and operational rigor make them great additions to the Intel Board — and they have had an immediate impact.</p>

"The Workday platform is used by approximately 70 million users, with approximately 1 trillion transactions moving annually. This is the amount of data accumulated to our company's strength in leveraging AI. By leveraging this data, we currently have eight AI agents listed at the bottom of the diagram."

"And the newest new product was ASOR. It is a solution that uses the know-how we have cultivated in human resource management to AI agents. There are three patterns of AI agents: not only what we provide, but what our customers have developed themselves, and what other vendors offer, so there are concerns that these will become increasingly common within companies in the future.

Furthermore, in managing these, security, governance, and compliance will become essential. ASOR is trying to meet these needs and enable the management of employees and AI agents in the company to centrally manage employees and AI agents."

ASOR is scheduled to be available from the second half of 2025, and it will be a little while before we can see people centrally managing a wide variety of AI agents.</p>

The measure authorizes the mobilization of military personnel to carry out large-scale raids to repress immigration, strengthens the country's safety infrastructure and involves restrictions on travel to the United States. 

Among the objectives of the narrow there is to stem the trafficking of Fenanyl and significantly reduce illegal immigration.

Last year, Musk's service launched a series of spy satellites for the NRO, in order to optimize the agency's space surveillance efforts.

The project involved Northrop Groumman, an American conglomerate specialized in computer security systems, radar, planes and space vehicles. 

In March 2024, Reuters reported that Starlink was building hundreds of satellites for the NRO, with the aim of developing an orbital system capable of detecting terrestrial objectives anywhere in the world.

According to the publication, these "satellites share these data with intelligence and military services".</p>

European government satellites regularly launched on Russian Soyuz rockets, but now Russia is non grata in European government circles, and the Trump administration is widening the trans-Atlantic rift. 

European leaders have cited the Trump administration and its close association with Elon Musk as prime reasons to support sovereign access to space, a capability currently offered only by Arianespace.

Isar Aerospace will try to launch its first rocket Saturday, aiming to become the first in a wave of new European launch companies to reach orbit. The Spectrum rocket consists of two stages, stands about 92 feet (28 meters) tall, and can haul payloads up to 1 metric ton (2,200 pounds) into low-Earth orbit.

Notably, this will be the first orbital launch attempt from a launch pad in Western Europe, with the French-run Guiana Space Center in South America being the primary spaceport for European rockets.</p>

To a T, his latest game, tells the story of Teen—a kid struggling to fit in, dealing with eye boogers, and finding themselves through song and exploration, all while their arms are inexplicably stuck in a T-pose.

The game follows Takahashi’s trajectory of creating colorful, playful games that are undeniably cute but incredibly odd. His best-known game is Katamari Damacy, about rolling up everything in sight in an ever-growing ball, featuring an unforgettable soundtrack and the most flamboyant king to ever grace games.

Others, like 2019’s Wattam, are eccentric, vibrant, and full of poop. The episodic tale opens with an upbeat song about the game (not to be confused with “The Giraffe Song,” sung in a teaser video by Rebecca Sugar).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since the first days of the Trump administration, Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been everywhere in the federal government, moving fast and breaking things.

The big takeaway: Many on the DOGE team are from Musk's world. If Musk is America's CEO, then DOGE has become his Silicon Valley executive branch.

We've mapped out a non-exhaustive list of people affiliated with DOGE, including creating a searchable table with each member, their corporate history, and the agencies they've been connected to.

We're focused on the new people brought in under the second Trump administration or directly hired into agencies—as Special Government Employees (SGEs) or regular employees—who are operating as members of DOGE teams.

The DOGE world, as it stands, seems to break down into roughly three categories: former Trump officials, conservative lawyers, and imports from the Silicon Valley area (funders, founders, technologists, or people connected to them).

In that first category we find people like DOGE spokesperson Katie Miller, the wife of White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller.

The second category are people like James Burnham and Austin Raynor, both former clerks for conservative Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, respectively.

Then, the biggest throughline of all: Of those Silicon Valley imports, one of the most clear themes across DOGE's ranks is fairly obvious: a connection to Elon Musk.

Forty-nine people on our list have connections to Musk, his companies, or his greater network. This connection is most often through one of his allies or one of his companies.

There are the obvious people like Steve Davis, president of Musk's Boring Company, who have followed Musk across his various ventures.

Similarly, SpaceX employee Brian Bjelde, who is now at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), also helped Musk downsize Twitter's staff in 2022.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Triggered by the rise of generative AI applications, China rapidly expanded its AI infrastructure in 2023 – 2024 and built hundreds of new data centers using both state and private funding.

But this boom has since lost momentum. Facilities that cost billions of dollars now sit underused, returns are falling, and the market for GPU rentals has collapsed.

The sudden drop in real estate activity following the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic increased pressure to find new economic drivers, and the rise of ChatGPT in late 2022 made AI seem like the next big thing.


In 2023 alone, more than 500 data center projects were proposed nationwide, according to KZ Consulting. By late 2024, at least 150 projects were reportedly operational.

Local authorities promoted these projects, hoping to boost their regional economies. State-owned companies, government-linked investment funds as well as private companies and investors were eager to back these data centers.


But as usually happens with rushed projects, poor planning was their downfall. For example, some facilities were often built without regard for actual demand or technical standards.

This is not particularly surprising as engineers with the relevant experience are rare, and many executives depended on middlemen who inflated projections or exploited procurement to get subsidies.

As a consequence, many new data centers fell short of expectations as they are expensive to run, difficult to fill, and technically irrelevant for contemporary AI workloads.


Some projects never planned to profit from computation at all. Certain companies used AI data centers to qualify for government-subsidized green energy or land deals.

In some cases, electricity earmarked for AI tasks was sold back into the grid for a mark-up. Others secured loans and tax incentives while leaving buildings unused.

By late 2024, most people still in the business were aiming to benefit from policy incentives rather than actual AI work.


When massive AI data centers were built in 2023 – 2024, the envisioned demand for AI training and AI inference performance requirements was different than the actual demand we see today.


Nowadays demand is shifting towards inference as this is what makes money for owners of AI models. Inference workloads do not necessarily require massive clusters based on tens of thousands of high-end Nvidia GPUs that are used for training.

By contrast, inference workloads can benefit from specialized accelerators with lower cost and power consumption, but faster response times.


As a result, monthly rental prices for an H100 server with eight GPUs designed for training have plummeted from ¥180,000 ($24,000) to ¥75,000 ($10,000). Interestingly, despite export restrictions, the H100 continues to flow steadily.

One of the biggest shifts came with the rise of DeepSeek, which released a reasoning model called R1 that achieved performance comparable to ChatGPT o1 but at significantly lower cost.


Despite the setbacks, central authorities remain committed to AI development. A government symposium held in early 2025 reaffirmed the need for national self-reliance in this area.

Major firms have followed suit: Alibaba announced over $50 billion in planned investments for cloud and AI infrastructure, and ByteDance committed another $20 billion.


Insiders believe Chinese officials will not abandon these projects, viewing them as growing pains rather than failures. The government is expected to take over floundering centers and assign them to more capable operators.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kirishima Sake Brewery in Miyazaki Prefecture is using Claris FileMaker and iPad to develop an in-house app.

The brewery produces approximately 800 tons of shochu per day, but previously had issues with handwritten records and data entry errors.

Field staff wanted to prepare reports in real-time at the inspection site, so they began selecting tools for development.

After comparing several no-code/low-code development tools, the brewery adopted FileMaker for its ease of use, cost performance, and scalability.

The app allows field staff to complete data entry and photo registration on-site, reducing transcription errors and labor hours by approximately 25%.

The email sending function notifies record confirmation and reduces communication errors.

The app also has a function to color fields that have passed the threshold when a number is entered, allowing abnormal values ​​to be noticed on the spot.

This made many tasks more efficient and easier to compare and analyze with past data.

Digitalizing input and stamps eliminated the need for paper forms, reducing the risk of foreign matter contamination.

The brewery achieved certification for the "FSSC22000" international standard for food safety management systems through this digitalization.

The alcohol quality management department digitizes "taste" data using FileMaker's Certified Liquor Evaluation App on their iPhone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>「Microsoft Office」を頻繁に使っている人なら試したくなるような、よく使うプログラムの高速化を狙った新機能が登場する。それが5月に展開予定の新たなオプション「Startup Boost」で、Officeアプリを起動する時の待ち時間が短縮される。

この機能が最初に導入されるのは「Microsoft Word」で、Officeスイートの他のアプリケージョンについては、今後のアップデートで追加される予定だ。Startup Boostは「Windows Task Scheduler」内のタスクとして表示され、機能の選択は完全にユーザーに委ねられている。そのため、Officeアプリにメモリーを食われることを望まないなら、簡単にオフにできる。

Microsoftは米国時間3月26日付のメッセージで、「MicrosoftはStartup Boostタスクを新たに導入する。これはOfficeアプリケーションのパフォーマンスと読み込み時間を最適化するものだ」と説明している。「展開は2025年5月から開始され、まずはWordが対象となる。このタスクの導入は任意で、Windows Task Schedulerに表示され、アプリ内の設定で無効にできる」



提供：Microsoft 提供：Microsoft

Speed Boostはどのような仕組みで起動の高速化を実現しているのだろうか？ ユーザーが「Windows」にログインすると、他のスケジュールされたタスク、プログラム、サービスが自動的に起動する。だがそれと同様に、関連するタスクもひそかに起動している。その後、Officeアプリはユーザーが起動させるまで一時停止の状態に置かれる。また、起動されない場合はシステムがメモリーから削除してリソースを解放する。

Speed Boostがアクティブ化されるのは、使用しているPCのメモリーとリソースが十分で、この機能がオンになってもWindowsのパフォーマンスに影響しない場合のみだ。具体的には、使用可能なメモリーが8GB以上、ディスクの空きスペースが5GB以上必要だ。また「省エネ機能」がオンになっている時も、Startup Boostは無効にされる。

Startup Boostを必要としないユーザーも、問題はない。（展開された後に）Wordで無効にするなら、「ファイル」メニューから「オプション」＞「全般」＞「起動時の設定」と進む。5月になると、ここに「Startup Boost」という新しい設定ができるので、使わない場合はチェックボックスのチェックを外せばいい。ほかにTask Schedulerで表示して無効にすることもできる。



提供：Microsoft 提供：Microsoft

「Startup Boostはオプションのパフォーマンス機能だ」とMicrosoftは説明している。「問題なく無効にできる。無効にしても、Microsoft Officeアプリケーションは完全に機能するが、読み込みにかかる時間は長くなるだろう。顧客はそもそもプロセスが開始されないようにすることで、Startup Boostを完全に無効にできる」</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India hosts only 1 per cent of the world’s subsea cable landing stations, in contrast to smaller countries such as Singapore which has 26 subsea cables landed across three landing sites.

The head of the telecom regulatory body made these remarks at India’s first-ever International Subsea Cable Systems Conference hosted by Broadband India Forum (BIF) in New Delhi on Tuesday, March 25.


The other speakers at the inaugural session of the conference included representatives from Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio.

Subsea cables account for more than 90 per cent of world data and 80 per cent of world trade as they move secure information about $10 trillion worth of financial transactions, as per Goldman Sachs.


Stating that the vulnerabilities of subsea cables are multifold, Lightstorm’s Amajit Gupta said, “I think most of the industry people will tell you that what’s happening in the Red Sea is a nightmare. Our internet either enters through the west or through the east and irrespective of how good the infrastructure is locally, if there’s a disruption at Red Sea, 25 per cent of India’s internet is affected.


Gupta added that the ability to monitor and repair the subsea cables fast enough is also beyond their control.

A report assessing the disaster preparedness of telecom networks in India highlighted that India currently lacks indigenous vessels to repair faults in subsea cables, which means that it depends on foreign vessels for these repairs. 

Bharti Airtel’s Rahul Vatts noted that despite TRAI’s strong recommendations after a good stakeholder consultation, progress has been minimal.

Airtel has reportedly backed 11 different cable systems, and has inked long-term capacity agreements for 34 other subsea cable projects with four more projects currently under development.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dario Amodei gets excited about AI and moves when discussing it. He cofounded Anthropic, which is trying to create an artificial general intelligence or "powerful AI" that will never go rogue.

Amodei has just gotten back from Davos, where he declared that in two or so years, Claude and its peers will surpass people in every cognitive task. 

A Chinese company called DeepSeek has released a state-of-the-art large language model for a fraction of what companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic spent. This challenges the current paradigm of cutting-edge AI.

Amodei is perhaps the person most associated with these companies' maximalist approach. Back when he worked at OpenAI, Amodei wrote an internal paper on something he'd mulled for years: a hypothesis called the Big Blob of Compute.

The theory proposed that feeding megatons of data to models could hasten the arrival of powerful AI and is now standard practice. The reason why leading models are so expensive to build is due to this practice, which only a few deep-pocketed companies can afford.

Amodei makes it clear that DeepSeek isn't keeping him up at night and rejects the idea that more efficient models will enable low-budget competitors to jump to the front of the line. He argues that "the value of what you're making goes up" if you get more intelligence per dollar.

More important than saving money, Amodei believes is getting to the AGI finish line. That's why companies like OpenAI and Microsoft announced plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars more on data centers and power plants after DeepSeek released its model.

Amodei obsesses over how humans can reach AGI safely and it compelled him and Anthropic's six other founders to leave OpenAI in the first place. At Anthropic, they're in a sprint to set global standards for all future AI models, so that they actually help humans instead of blowing them up.

The team hopes to prove that it can build an AGI so safe, so ethical, and so effective that its competitors see the wisdom in following suit. Amodei calls this the Race to the Top.

That's where Claude comes in. The mission would be impossible without it, as it is everywhere and has been since the early days at Anthropic.

Amodei's dream is for Claude to be both our wing model and fairy godmodel as we enter an age of abundance. But here's a trippy question: Can Claude itself be trusted to play nice?

One of Amodei's Anthropic cofounders is none other than his sister, Daniela. Their parents moved from Italy to San Francisco in the 1970s.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Dario Amodei gets excited about AI, he moves around the room quickly. He scrawls charts on a whiteboard to explain how machine intelligence is growing.

He's trying to create an artificial general intelligence at Anthropic, which will be a good guy and usher in utopia. While Amodei is vital to Anthropic, he comes second to the company's most important contributor: Claude, an AI model.

Amodei just got back from Davos where he predicted that Claude and its peers will surpass humans in every cognitive task in two years or so. He and Claude are now dealing with a crisis caused by a Chinese company called DeepSeek releasing a state-of-the-art large language model at a lower cost than other companies.

The current paradigm of cutting-edge AI, which consists of multibillion-dollar expenditures on hardware and energy, seems shaky. Amodei is associated with the maximalist approach to building powerful AI models, where more data can lead to greater intelligence.

He proposed the Big Blob of Compute hypothesis, which has become standard practice among top companies. Anthropic and its peers were thought to have a significant advantage over newcomers due to their large budgets for hardware and energy.

However, DeepSeek's model seems to be an exception, built without the need for massive resources. Amodei dismisses the idea that more efficient models will enable low-budget competitors to jump to the front of the line.

He believes that with more intelligence per dollar, companies might want to spend even more on data centers and power plants. Companies like OpenAI and Microsoft are announcing plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on their infrastructure.

Amodei's main concern is how humans can reach AGI safely. This question led him and Anthropic's other founders to leave OpenAI due to concerns about CEO Sam Altman's leadership.

At Anthropic, they're trying to set global standards for AI models so that they actually help humans instead of harming them. Amodei calls this the Race to the Top. The team hopes to prove that it can build an AGI so safe and effective that its competitors will follow suit.

Claude is crucial to Anthropic's mission, but you won't find it sitting in a conference room or riding an elevator. It's everywhere since the early days of the company.

The mission would be impossible without Claude, which was trained by engineers and used to produce better Claudes. If Amodei's dream comes true, Claude will be both our wing model and fairy godmodel as we enter an age of abundance.

However, a trippy question arises: Can Claude itself be trusted to play nice?</p>

This has significantly improved business efficiency, including a 30% reduction in the number of operators responding to the company. 

LINE WORKS AiCall is a telephone response AI service that combines voice recognition, voice synthesis, and conversation control. Based on the customer's free speech, AI quickly distributes inquiries to accurate channels.

Credit Saison, which operates a credit card business, has approximately 35 million members. To respond to more than 200,000 inquiries a month, the company operated a push-type automatic voice response system (IVR).

Credit Saison has named the AI-based customer-responsive system "AI Navi." LINE WORKS AiCall determines the content of the inquiry from conversations with the customer and allocates it to the most appropriate channel.

By linking the inquiry contents through a dashboard, operators can check the needs in advance, allowing for smooth responses. After the introduction of LINE WORKS AiCall, the number of operators responded to the company was reduced by 30%, and the IVR completion rate increased by 40%.</p>

Since it is a Lumon device, it is unclear what kind of hardware it is, but the page displays a warning saying "spoiler warning" and also includes a link to the approximately 11-minute making-of footage.

Season 2 of Severance has recently ended on Apple TV Plus, and season 3 has already been decided. 

The making-of footage features co-creator Ben Stiller talking about how three editorial staff put together the 83TB footage into the final episode of Season 2.

It also explains how to edit the marching band scene in the final episode, as well as video processing for episode 7, where the atmosphere changes dramatically within the work.

The third part tells how much music supports the tone of the drama.

This is part of a promotion using fictional retro devices that appear in Apple-produced dramas to promote the latest Apple hardware to video editors and musicians.

Apple is in a unique position to perform these crossover productions without any discomfort, according to Andy Tsai, professor of business analytics at Santa Clara University's Leavy School of Management.

Tsai said, "I think it's a really good idea. This is a slightly special combination of situations. They produce their own programs while selling iconic hardware, and the audience is integrated into it. They have the perfect conditions."

Apple invests billions of dollars in Apple TV Plus to produce content that can be played on its own devices.

This model has a precedent in which General Electric made radio and television programs and sold receivers and television at the same time.

Tsai said Apple is trying to build an ecosystem of hardware and content, but they're doing it very well.</p>

This project aims to start operations within fiscal 2030 and will create a flexible and efficient system environment.

By migrating to the public cloud, IT resources can be managed easily, cost optimization and development using advanced IT technology can be achieved.

Hitachi will visualize current programs through pre-verification using the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) service and slim down the programs to be migrated.

Hitachi's open middleware with experience in migrations from mainframes and operating in public clouds will minimize application changes during migration.

The company will use generation AI to reduce the burden on migration and development work, improve accuracy and achieve a quick and reliable migration.

Kyoei Fire was required to modernize core systems to promote DX and strengthen cooperation with external services due to growing challenges.

Many companies face mainframe challenges, such as increased development costs and a shortage of mainframe engineers, which are becoming more serious.

Kyoei Fire aims to improve efficiency in system development, improve customer satisfaction and flexibly develop products and provide services that meet diverse needs.

Hitachi will support the realization of DX in Kyoei Fire and solving problems by ensuring the project is promoted.</p>

The network situation is being understood at this time, and "Network for AI (NW for AI)" is being verified, which dynamically controls video and communication quality optimal for video analysis using AI.


Specifically, the image quality of the camera mounted on the robot is optimized in real time according to the available network bandwidth and radio wave strength.

It provides efficient control of network resources while maintaining sufficient resolution for AI analysis.

The robot senses dangers at intersections and notifies the owner and surrounding area, helping people live in a safe way.</p>

For example, if there were multiple switches in a home and each family member had an account, they would have to buy another downloadable software if their accounts were different. With this new feature, families can now rent and borrow the same software, just like they're plugging in and out of a Famicom cassette.

You will need an internet connection when renting. Furthermore, only three people can lend it. You can only lend one game per account, and it lasts for 14 days. You can have it returned at any time during the period, and it will be automatically returned after the period has passed. Save data remains even after the product is returned, so you can purchase the software yourself and play the rest.

Also, even if you have two Switches with the same Nintendo account, you can play one game title simply by re-setting the virtual game card on the console you want to play. In addition, a local connection is required for the first communication.

The feature will be for the Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch 2, which will be officially announced on April 2nd.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers in New Zealand have developed a technique to prevent bacteria from adhering to metal surfaces by creating fine textures using a laser.

The laser-processed surfaces physically block bacteria adhesion, growth, and spread.

These fine textures mimic the natural antibacterial structures found in cicada wings and shark skin.


The surface of the cicada's feather is a structure with countless fine needle-like protrusions of tens of nanometers. It is believed that when bacteria come into contact with this nanostructure, the cell membrane will be torn and the bacteria will die. The cicada's surface also has high water-repellent properties that repel water, making it difficult for bacteria to adhere.


The shark's skin is also covered with a special scale called shield scales, with fine microscale grooves lined up on its surface.

This groove makes the water flow smoother on the surface of the body and prevents the accumulation of bacteria and dirt.


Researchers have successfully created a structure that is less likely to adhere to bacteria by forming micro- or nano-scale unevenness on the metal surface using "laser-induced surface texturing".

This surface treatment also has the effect of changing the water repellency, and it is expected to suppress the growth of bacteria.

To verify the effectiveness of this surface treatment in suppressing bacteria adhesion, researchers compared the concentration of bacteria remaining on processed metal surfaces and raw surfaces in Escherichia coli and Brochothrix thermosphacta.


A significant inhibitory effect was confirmed for one laser-processed surface under high concentration conditions, and four surfaces exhibited clear effects under low concentration conditions.

Similarly, a significant inhibitory effect was confirmed for E. coli in three types under high concentration conditions and four types under low concentration conditions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2019年12月に文部科学省が発表した「GIGAスクール構想」から約5年がたち、各自治体や教育事業を展開する企業は「GIGAスクール構想 第2期（NEXT GIGA）」に向けた取り組みを始めている。本稿では、更新が迫る情報端末と、NEXT GIGAで注目されるデータ活用について取り上げたい。

まずGIGAスクール構想の意義を改めて確認すると、1人1台の情報端末と高速大容量の通信ネットワークを全国の小・中学校に整備すること、そして多様な子どもたちを誰一人取り残すことなく、個別最適化され、資質・能力が一層確実に育成できる教育ICT環境を実現することを目的にしている。

2月に開催された「教育DX推進フォーラム」で文部科学省 初等中等教育局 学校情報基盤・教材課長の寺島史朗氏は、GIGAスクール構想で浮かび上がった課題として、「ICT活用の学校間・自治体間の格差」「通信ネットワーク速度」「校務DX」――の3点を挙げている（関連記事）。NEXT GIGAではこの課題を解消しつつ、学校のICT環境の更新や端末のさらなる活用の促進が求められている。

2019年から児童・生徒に対して1人1台端末が整備され、早い自治体では2024年度から端末の更新が始まっている。2025～2026年にかけては約950万台の端末更新が予定されているという。NEXT GIGAでは都道府県単位での共同調達が進む中、複数の自治体では独自の教育を展開するために市区町村単体での調達をするケースも少なくない。

各社、NEXT GIGAに向けた新たな端末を展開しているが、ここではNECとレノボの新モデルにフォーカスしたい。両社で共通しているのは、「堅牢（けんろう）性・耐久性の強化」だ。端末の故障理由としてさまざまなことが挙げられるが、机や持ち運び時の落下による破損、USBポートに鉛筆を挿すことによる発煙など、児童ならではの理由が多く挙げられた。

NECが提供する学習者用端末の新モデル「NEC Chromebook Y4」では、マザーボードからの電源供給を不要とする回路にするためサブボードの設計を変更し、ショートが起きにくく、発火・発煙に結び付きにくい基盤を設計。また、全ての電源供給ケーブルに保護回路を追加し、発火・発煙の発現を低下しているという。

開口部への鉛筆や消しゴムなどの異物差し込み対策としては、開口部を極力減らし、左側面に集約した。加えて、机上の鉛筆を滑らせても開口部に入らない高さにし、発煙防止対策を徹底している（関連記事）。

他方、レノボはハードウェアと各種ソリューションを統合したパッケージ「Lenovo GIGA School Edition」をNEXT GIGAに向けに提供する。同パッケージ内で提供される端末は、米国国防総省の調達基準「MIL規格」に準拠するほか、レノボ独自の教育向け製品用の堅牢性基準を満たすテスト「Lenovo DuraSpec」を実施し、耐久性を検証。76cmの高さからコンクリートまたはスチール板に落下させるテストや、ねじり試験、圧力試験などを行い、端末に破損がないか、全ての機能が動作するかを確認している。

また、ICT活用の格差に対しては「教員が使わせたくなる、生徒が使いたくなるような端末作り」をコンセプトに、利便性を向上させるペンシルタッチ機能と活用を促進する無料ソリューションサービスを用意した。ペンシルタッチ機能では、普段から児童・生徒が利用している鉛筆をタッチペン代わりに使えるようにしている。鉛筆削りで書き心地を調整でき、2B以上の軟らかさの鉛筆に対応する（関連記事）。

各端末の詳細なスペックは関連記事をご覧いただきたいが、両社ともに“壊れにくさ”を重視した端末の設計に尽力したことがうかがえる。他方、筆者が教育現場に足を運んだ際に印象的だったのが、授業中に端末の電池が切れてしまい、充電器がある棚の上で充電しながら端末を利用している生徒の姿だ。これは高校で見た風景だったので、小・中学校に当てはまるかは分からないが、今後デジタル教科書が普及する中で授業中に端末を使えない状況になるのは致命的だ。教室内だけで端末を利用するとも限らない。改良を重ねた新たな端末が、NEXT GIGAではどのように使われていくのか注目していきたい。</p>

While data is already the core of business, many companies have "data but are not being able to utilize it." When considering introducing a data cloud, the most important thing is to clarify and put "business issues you want to solve."

The next step is to delve into business issues, clarify the gap between these factors and the current situation, and put it into words. This includes various factors such as:

Data is siloed and it is not easy to access the required data
There are challenges in the scalability and performance of the foundation
Query performance is susceptible to other processes and is not stable

Once the factors are clear, the next step is to develop an action plan as a solution. Action plans include improvements to software aspects such as "culture fostering" and "human resource development," but first we'll give you some points related to the "base."

For example, if "data is siloed and it is not easy to access the necessary data" is a priority and we want to solve the issue, then the requirements would be:

It also costs development and operational costs, and does not cause data transfer between platforms
While achieving easy access, you can provide detailed permission control based on position and organizational authority</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Software as a Service (SaaS) has been at the heart of the technology world for at least 20 years, providing full access to applications over the Internet.

Currently, artificial intelligence (AI) is overturning this mechanism and is beginning to autonomously utilize applications to provide services. This is called "Services as Software" (SaS).

AI is creating this new world for technology personnel and business staff. Frank Diana, a futurist at Tata Consultancy Services, wrote in a recent post: "Companies have previously bought software and hired human experts to run it," he said.

"Ai is trying to turn that model over. There will be more and more designing corporate processes in AI from the start. Rather than adding Ai later, it will be the default worker." Almost all occupations will be affected by this change."

A survey of 1,000 companies by HFS found that 60% of companies are considering procuring their services as technology products.

Similarly, 60% of companies plan to "replace some or all of their professional services with some kind of Ai within three to five years."

Similar trends are occurring in the daily IT maintenance, human resources, procurement, accounting and customer service operations.

"It's becoming much easier to replicate these tasks with evolving generator AI and agent software," the HFS authors Saurabh Gupta and Phil Fersht wrote.

Tasks that once required a team of experts are now being handled by AI-equipped systems that can autonomously perform tasks.

This transformation is not limited to automation, it redefines how businesses use and deliver services. This new model represents a major shift from the past: software is no longer a tool for human workers, and in many cases software becomes workers."

The SaaS model was primarily focused on applications hosted in the cloud. "Services as Software" incorporating intelligent technologies such as AI, digital twins, predictive analytics, and autonomous systems requires human experts to shift their role.

This highlights the importance of experts rethinking their skillsets and prioritizing AI literacy, strategic thinking and human-machine synergies," Diana continues. 

In addition, adapting to new career paths with an emphasis on orchestrating an integrated service ecosystem will become mandatory."

To prepare for this change, Diana urged technology professionals to "advanced continuing learning, improve Ai and automation skills."</p>

2020年3月14日に山手線30番目の駅として開業した高輪ゲートウェイ駅を中心とする街が、本格的に始動した。

移動モビリティや限定店舗が登場

高輪ゲートウェイ駅2階の南改札を出ると、東京在住のフランス人建築家のエマニュエル・ムホー氏が手がける「100色の道」で彩られた、街を横断する1km超のストリート「新東海道」が広がる。歩行者のほか、搭乗できる試運転の自動走行モビリティが5台行き交い、移動をサポートする。

南改札を出て左横にあるイベントスペース「マチアイ」では、高輪ゲートウェイ駅から街歩きして地域の魅力を発見するイベントの第1弾「マチアイカフェバル “マチあるキッチン”」に、新たな出店ショップを追加。港区にあるベーカリーレストラン「Le Pain Quotidian」のオーガニック小麦100％のパンや、「高輪はちみつ」と組み合わせた「FETISH CLUB」の限定のオリジナルビール「芝浜ハニー」、「PASSAGE COFFEE」のオリジナルブレンド「タカナワマチアイブレンド（HOTのみ）」などを楽しめる。

マチあるキッチンは5月6日まで実施し、以降も街と街の交流をサポートするイベントを実施予定。イベントの企画などを担当するJR東日本クロスステーション デベロップメントカンパニー 営業部 イベントユニット 副課長の大川優香氏は、直近ではロストフラワーをテーマにしたイベントを計画していると話した。

中心は「THE LINKPILLAR 1」--2026年のグランドオープンに向け

TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITYは、2026年春のグランドオープンを予定している。今回の街開きでは駅前のツインタワー「THE LINKPILLAR 1」の利用が始まった。

THE LINKPILLAR 1は、1フロアの床面積が国内最大規模のオフィスフロアを備える。国際的な企業の本社が移転を計画するなどほぼ満床状態で、2025年度中には約2万人のオフィスワーカーが集う予定。そのほか、国際会議も可能な駅直結のコンベンションホールやビジネス創造施設に加え、秋には「JWマリオット・ホテル東京」「NEWoMan TAKANAWA」などが開業する。なお、NEWoMan TAKANAWAの「ブルーボトルコーヒー 高輪カフェ」「ニコライ バーグマン 高輪店」は同日に先行オープン済みだ。

多様なデータ活用するスマートシティ

TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITYでは、THE LINKPILLAR 1に入居予定のKDDIと連携し、さまざまなデータを収集、活用できる「TAKANAWA INNOVATION PLATFORM」を構築する。

KDDIの「WAKONX SmartCityソリューション」を採用し、街の設備や人に関するデータを収集・分析する基盤となる“都市OS”「TAKANAWA GATEWAY URBAN OS」により、データを活用したスマートシティを実現する。「一人一人の興味関心にあった情報のアプリへの配信」「状況に合わせて自律的に行動するロボットサービス」「街全体のリアルタイムデータから未来をシミュレーションするダッシュボード」などを提供するという。

具体的には、3月24日に配信を開始した街の独自アプリ「TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITYアプリ」や、さまざまなロボットを制御する「ロボットプラットフォーム」、鉄道の運行情報、セキュリティゲートの通過情報、防犯カメラの映像、「au」「Suica」の位置情報・属性情報・興味関心のデータ、防犯防災、イベント、商業、オフィスなど、異分野の膨大なデータを個人情報保護に配慮しながら融合、分析する。

提供するサービスの一例としては、4月11日にロボットによる「フードデリバリーサービス」を開始する。リアルタイムな街の混雑情報を防犯カメラデータから取得し、人の多いルートを避けて最短で商品を配送するという。

アプリでは、改札やゲート通過時に興味関心にあった情報の配信、状況に応じて生成AIが投稿内容を変化させるまちマップなどを提供する。3月30日まではダウンロードおよびSuicaを登録して高輪ゲートウェイ駅を出札すると「TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITYオリジナル仕様 前田珈琲のドリップコーヒーパック1点」をプレゼントするキャンペーンも実施中だ。

そのほか、リアルタイムの人流データなどから街の未来をシミュレーションするダッシュボードを運用し、イベントや災害時などに活用するという。

なお、ネットワーク環境はサービス追加や環境変化に対して柔軟に拡張・対応できるよう構築する。その上にさらに、高セキュリティ・高拡張性かつ災害に強いサーバー基盤を構築し、都市OSや各サービスのデータを安全に連携させるという。街と「au」のデータによるスマートシティを実現し、利用者に快適なサービスの提供を目指す。

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>東日本旅客鉄道（JR東日本）は3月27日、「TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITY」のまちびらきを実施した。

2020年3月14日に山手線30番目の駅として開業した高輪ゲートウェイ駅を中心とする街が、本格的に始動した。

移動モビリティや限定店舗が登場

高輪ゲートウェイ駅2階の南改札を出ると、東京在住のフランス人建築家のエマニュエル・ムホー氏が手がける「100色の道」で彩られた、街を横断する1km超のストリート「新東海道」が広がる。歩行者のほか、搭乗できる試運転の自動走行モビリティが5台行き交い、移動をサポートする。

南改札を出て左横にあるイベントスペース「マチアイ」では、高輪ゲートウェイ駅から街歩きして地域の魅力を発見するイベントの第1弾「マチアイカフェバル “マチあるキッチン”」に、新たな出店ショップを追加。港区にあるベーカリーレストラン「Le Pain Quotidian」のオーガニック小麦100％のパンや、「高輪はちみつ」と組み合わせた「FETISH CLUB」の限定のオリジナルビール「芝浜ハニー」、「PASSAGE COFFEE」のオリジナルブレンド「タカナワマチアイブレンド（HOTのみ）」などを楽しめる。

マチあるキッチンは5月6日まで実施し、以降も街と街の交流をサポートするイベントを実施予定。イベントの企画などを担当するJR東日本クロスステーション デベロップメントカンパニー 営業部 イベントユニット 副課長の大川優香氏は、直近ではロストフラワーをテーマにしたイベントを計画していると話した。

中心は「THE LINKPILLAR 1」--2026年のグランドオープンに向け

TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITYは、2026年春のグランドオープンを予定している。今回の街開きでは駅前のツインタワー「THE LINKPILLAR 1」の利用が始まった。

THE LINKPILLAR 1は、1フロアの床面積が国内最大規模のオフィスフロアを備える。国際的な企業の本社が移転を計画するなどほぼ満床状態で、2025年度中には約2万人のオフィスワーカーが集う予定。そのほか、国際会議も可能な駅直結のコンベンションホールやビジネス創造施設に加え、秋には「JWマリオット・ホテル東京」「NEWoMan TAKANAWA」などが開業する。なお、NEWoMan TAKANAWAの「ブルーボトルコーヒー 高輪カフェ」「ニコライ バーグマン 高輪店」は同日に先行オープン済みだ。

多様なデータ活用するスマートシティ

TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITYでは、THE LINKPILLAR 1に入居予定のKDDIと連携し、さまざまなデータを収集、活用できる「TAKANAWA INNOVATION PLATFORM」を構築する。

KDDIの「WAKONX SmartCityソリューション」を採用し、街の設備や人に関するデータを収集・分析する基盤となる“都市OS”「TAKANAWA GATEWAY URBAN OS」により、データを活用したスマートシティを実現する。「一人一人の興味関心にあった情報のアプリへの配信」「状況に合わせて自律的に行動するロボットサービス」「街全体のリアルタイムデータから未来をシミュレーションするダッシュボード」などを提供するという。

具体的には、3月24日に配信を開始した街の独自アプリ「TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITYアプリ」や、さまざまなロボットを制御する「ロボットプラットフォーム」、鉄道の運行情報、セキュリティゲートの通過情報、防犯カメラの映像、「au」「Suica」の位置情報・属性情報・興味関心のデータ、防犯防災、イベント、商業、オフィスなど、異分野の膨大なデータを個人情報保護に配慮しながら融合、分析する。

提供するサービスの一例としては、4月11日にロボットによる「フードデリバリーサービス」を開始する。リアルタイムな街の混雑情報を防犯カメラデータから取得し、人の多いルートを避けて最短で商品を配送するという。

アプリでは、改札やゲート通過時に興味関心にあった情報の配信、状況に応じて生成AIが投稿内容を変化させるまちマップなどを提供する。3月30日まではダウンロードおよびSuicaを登録して高輪ゲートウェイ駅を出札すると「TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITYオリジナル仕様 前田珈琲のドリップコーヒーパック1点」をプレゼントするキャンペーンも実施中だ。

そのほか、リアルタイムの人流データなどから街の未来をシミュレーションするダッシュボードを運用し、イベントや災害時などに活用するという。

なお、ネットワーク環境はサービス追加や環境変化に対して柔軟に拡張・対応できるよう構築する。その上にさらに、高セキュリティ・高拡張性かつ災害に強いサーバー基盤を構築し、都市OSや各サービスのデータを安全に連携させるという。街と「au」のデータによるスマートシティを実現し、利用者に快適なサービスの提供を目指す。

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>締め切りに遅れる人間が自分以外にもいることを知って安心した。Linus Torvalds氏は次のように告白した。「3月23日、通常の日曜日午後のリリーススケジュールに沿って6.14をリリースしなかった理由について、説得力のある言い訳があるといいのだが、実際には、弁解の余地はない。単に私が無能だっただけだ。23日のリリースの間際になって何かが起きたわけでは決してない。私はマージウィンドウに備えるために、今回のリリースとは無関係な作業を処理していた。その過程で、6.14を実際にリリースすることを完全に忘れてしまっていた」

多少の遅れはあったが、「Linux 6.14」には、「Ubuntu 25.04」や「Fedora 42」など、間もなく登場予定のLinuxディストリビューションを強化する最先端の機能と改善が多数含まれている。

デスクトップユーザーにとってのビッグニュースは、改善された「NTSYNC」ドライバーである。Linuxで「Windows」ゲームをプレイしたり、「Windows」プログラムを実行したりしたいユーザーにとっては、特に重要な機能だ。このドライバーは、「Windows NT」の同期プリミティブをエミュレートするように設計されている。この機能によって、「Wine」や「Steam Play」で実行されるWindowsプログラムのパフォーマンスが大幅に向上する、ということを知っておけば大丈夫だろう。

Linuxゲーマーはこのリリースを心待ちにしていた。「YouTube」にLinux関連の動画を投稿しているGardiner Bryant氏は、「NTSYNCによって、Linuxのゲームは永遠に変わるだろう」と宣言した。Redditでは、ある投稿者が次のように述べた。「NTSYNCはすべての要件を満たしている。高速性、ポータビリティー、強力な性能、正確性を備えている。正確性は、『futex/futex2』インターフェースの応急処置や繰り返しを試みるのではなく、Windows風の同期セマンティクスをカーネルモジュールに実装することで実現された」

ゲーマーは常に最高のグラフィックスパフォーマンスを求めるので、Linuxが先ごろ発売されたAdvanced Micro Devices（AMD）の「RDNA 4」グラフィックスカードのサポートを追加したことも歓迎するはずだ。このアプローチには、AMDの「Radeon RX 9070 XT」および「Radeon RX 9070」グラフィックスカードのサポートが含まれる。このサポートと先ごろ改善されたオープンソースの「RADV」ドライバーの相乗効果により、AMDゲーマーはゲームをプレイするマシンで過去最高の速度を体験できるはずだ。

もちろん、このリリースはゲーマーだけを対象としているわけではない。Linux 6.14には、AMDとIntelのプロセッサー関連の機能強化もいくつか含まれている。例えば、電力管理、熱制御、コンピューティングパフォーマンスの最適化などの機能強化が施されている。これらのアップデートにより、システム全体の効率とパフォーマンスが向上するはずだ。

このリリースには、「AMD XDNA」ドライバーも含まれている。このドライバーは、「XDNA」アーキテクチャーをベースとするAMDのNPUの公式サポートを提供する。これにより、サポート対象のAMDハードウェア上で直接、畳み込みニューラルネットワーク（CNN）や大規模言語モデル（LLM）などのAIワークロードを効率的に実行することが可能になる。

「Rust」はこの数カ月、Linuxでいくつかの問題に直面しているが、Linux 6.14では、Rustプログラミング言語の抽象化がさらに進んでおり、Rustで記述されたドライバーを提供する準備が整った。Linuxの安定版カーネルのメンテナーであるGreg Kroah-Hartman氏は先ごろ、次のように述べた。「RustのさまざまなドライバーバインディングとRustのその他の変更により、さまざまなドライバーが実際に可能になった。これが転換点になると思う。これらのバインディングが登場したことで、今後、さらに多くのRustドライバーが登場するだろう」

ドライバーのほかにも、「Rust for Linux」の主任開発者のMiguel Ojeda氏は先ごろ、「Rust 1.84: derive」（「CoercePointee」）でスマートポインターのマクロが導入されたことについて、「安定したRust関数のみを使用するカーネルの構築プロセスにおける重要なマイルストーン」だと述べた。このアプローチにより、「C」とRustのコードの統合も容易になる。われわれは、RustのLinuxへの移植という目標にかなり近づいている。

さらに、Linux 6.14はQualcommの最新の「Snapdragon 8 Elite」モバイルプロセッサーもサポートしており、このチップセットを搭載したデバイスのパフォーマンスと安定性が向上している。このサポートにより、2025年中に極めて高速な「Android」ベースのスマートフォンが登場するはずだ。

Linux 6.14には、いわゆる「GhostWrite」脆弱（ぜいじゃく）性を修正するパッチが含まれている。この脆弱性が悪用されると、一部の「RISC-V」プロセッサーがルート化されるおそれがある。今回の修正により、そのような攻撃がブロックされる。

さらに、Linux 6.14には、コピーオンライトの「Btrfs」ファイルシステム／論理ボリュームマネージャーの改善も含まれている。これらの読み取り分散方法は、さまざまなRAIDハードウェアの構成とワークロードに柔軟性を提供する。さらに、キャッシュされていないバッファーI/Oのサポートにより、高速ストレージデバイスを備えたシステムでのメモリー使用が最適化される。

簡潔に言うと、Linux 6.14はLinuxの進化における大きな前進であり、ゲーム愛好家からAI研究者、開発者まで、さまざまなユーザーのニーズに対応した強力な機能セットを提供する。リリースが少し遅れたとはいえ、Linux 6.14のさまざまな機能強化のおかげで、多用途で先進的なプラットフォームとしてのLinuxの地位はより強固になった。

Linux 6.14を試してみたい人は、今すぐ実行に移すことが可能だ。Linux 6.14はすでにダウンロード公開されている。Torvalds氏によると、「保留中のプルリクエストが山積している」ので、「Linux 6.15」にはさらに多くの変更が施される見通しだという。</p>

Microsoftは、2025年に創業50周年を迎える。講演の冒頭でNadella氏は、「Microsoftにとって日本は本質的に重要な存在であり続けている」と切り出し、顧客、パートナーを含む「全ての皆さまに感謝を申し上げたい」と述べた。また、クライアント／サーバー、クラウド、そして現在のAIと、コンピューティングプラットフォームトレンドが大きく変遷する中でも日本の位置付けは同様だと話した。

同社は、2024年4月に日本を対象としてAIおよびデータセンターなどで2900億ドル規模の投資を行うと表明した。「Microsoft Research Asia Tokyo」の開設など既に幾つもの施策を実行しており、Nadella氏はこの投資に基づく取り組みを引き続き進めていくなどと説明。今回のイベントに合わせて新たに、4月中旬から「Microsoft Azure」データセンターの東日本／西日本リージョンでNVIDIA製GPUを含む「Azureハイパフォーマンスコンピューティング」（Azure HPC）を提供することを発表。国内企業・組織がAI処理を含むより高度な計算機資源サービスを利用できるようになるとアピールした。



Azureデータセンターの東日本／西日本リージョンでAI向けの提供リソースを大幅に強化するという Azureデータセンターの東日本／西日本リージョンでAI向けの提供リソースを大幅に強化するという

AIのトレンドが生成AIやAIエージェントへと変化する中で、Nadella氏はAIエージェントが個人や企業・組織の生産的な活動に貢献する「エージェンティックな時代が到来しており、このテクノロジーにより世界のあらゆる個人や企業・組織をエンパワーさせるという（Microsoftの）ミッションの実現にフォーカスしている」と述べ、生成AIとAIエージェントが個人の生活から企業・組織のあらゆるビジネスの在り方や体験といったものを変革させていくとした。

ここで同社は、生成AIプラットフォームの「Copilot」「Copilot＆AI stack」「Copilot devices」の3つのプラットフォームアプローチを取っているとした。

まずCopilotは、AIのためのユーザーインターフェース（UI）になり、Nadella氏は日常的な利用やその体験が世界的に広がりつつあると強調。日本でも日経平均株価構成銘柄の「日経225」企業の85％がCopilotを導入済みだとも述べた。AIエージェントに高度で複雑なタスクを実行させる上でもCopilotは、UIとして大きな役割を担うとする。

また、Copilotアプリケーション基盤の「Copilot Studio」でもAIエージェントの作成、構築、運用管理などの機能を拡充し、大規模なAIエージェントの協働環境を実現可能とする。プラットフォームとしてのCopilotは、その“原動力”となるデータをMicrosoftの各種アプリケーションやサービスあるいはコネクターを介したサードパーティーのデータとも接続される。講演の舞台上でNadella氏は、米国時間25日に発表したばかりの新たなAIエージェントの「Researcher」と「Analyst」も披露して見せた。

Copilot＆AI stackは、世界で展開する300以上のデータセンターの60以上のリージョンが根幹であり、Nadella氏は、シリコンレベル（半導体）からソフトウェアに至る広範なインフラ領域での投資と最適化によって、顧客に対する高性能なサービスと優れたコスト効率の価値を提供しているなどと説明。データ領域ではMicrosoftの各種データベースサービスや「Oracle Database」「Snowflake」などのエコシステムからなるプラットフォームがあり、AIアプリケーション領域では、1800以上の言語モデルとも接続可能な「Azure AI Foundry」を展開している。AIを活用するツール類も重要であり、例えば、開発プラットフォームの「GitHub」は、日本のユーザーが前年比23％増の355万人に到達したという。

Copilot devicesは、Copilot機能を容易に活用できるPCの「Copilot PC」といったデバイス領域になる。具体的にどのような製品が展開されているのかは未知数だが、Nadella氏はオフライン環境における高度なAI利用といった姿を提示した。ここでの実例が日本航空（JAL）の取り組みになる。

JALでは、航空機に搭乗する客室乗務員のレポート作成の負荷を低減するためにAIの活用を実証。レポート作成を支援するAIアプリケーションや小規模言語モデル（SLM）を開発し、ファインチューニングを重ねて正確性を向上させ、例えば、到着直後のレポート作成に要する時間を従前の40～50分から20分程度に短縮した。Nadella氏は、将来にこのようなことを航空機に搭載可能なデバイスで実現できるだろうとした。

最後にNadella氏は、AI時代では「信頼」の構築が大前提になると述べ、製品やサービスの構想段階から安全性を確立していく「セキュリティバイデザイン」をはじめとして、Microsoftのあらゆる取り組みでセキュリティを最優先に位置付けていると説明した。AIをセキュリティに活用する施策も拡大し、米国時間24日には「Security Copilot」の新機能として、サードパーティー連携を含む11種類のセキュリティAIエージェント群を発表している。

基調講演の後半では、日本マイクロソフト 代表取締役 社長の津坂美樹氏が司会役となり、顧客のAI事例として第一生命保険 代表取締役社長の隅野俊亮氏、ソフトバンク 専務執行役員の藤長国浩氏、東京都副都知事の宮坂学氏が取り組みを紹介した。

第一生命保険の隅野氏は、同社のAI活用の目的を業務効率化だけでなくビジネス価値の拡大などに置いているとし、生成AI関連で約50件のプロジェクトを展開中だという。営業担当者と保険代理店とのコミュニケーション活性化や提案力強化など多くの業務をAIが支援するシステムを開発中で、2026年4月の提供開始を目指しているとした。

ソフトバンクの藤長氏は、法人顧客への営業提案など多彩な業務でAIを活用中だと説明。生成AI／AIエージェントによる顧客対応でも高い顧客満足度を獲得しているし、個人契約者に対応するコールセンターでは約6000席のオペレーターブースを8割削減できるとした。

東京都の宮坂氏は、都庁全職員の業務基盤が「Microsoft 365」に移行し、AIで多くの業務効率化を図ることができるとコメント。例えば、ウェブや電話などで寄せられる毎日数万件規模で“都民の声”をAIで集約、分類することにより、都職員がより都民に寄り添えるようになったほか、Azureには都とのAI開発環境を内製により構築中。都下62区市町村が共同利用でき、自治体ごとに単独開発するような無駄をなくして、各自治体の成果を共有、活用できるようにしていくという。

津坂氏は、同社の日本でのAI関連投資を継続していると述べ、サイバーセキュリティ分野でのAI利用の知識とスキルを育成する新プログラム「CyberSmart AI」を同日から無償提供することも明らかにした。これは日本独自に開発したものといい、今国会で法制化審議中の能動的サイバー防御に関連して、政府機関と基幹インフラ事業者、公営企業などを対象としている。最新のサイバーセキュリティにおける攻撃と防御、サイバーレジリエンスとセキュリティオペレーションにおけるAI活用を体系的に習得できるとしている。</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers Goto Hayato, Watabiki Ken, and Tatsumura Kosuke are working on quantum computers at Toshiba.

The company began researching quantum technology in the 1990s, but it wasn't until 2015 that they started researching superconductivity as a method for quantum computers.

Goto explains that Toshiba's strength is its continuous research into quantum computers since the early stage. He realized that superconductivity was the most potential method and began research in earnest in 2015.

Toshiba is developing a "simulated branching machine" that specializes in large-scale combinational optimization problems, which can find optimal results from a huge number of options.

The installed devices look like normal servers, but even quantum computers can solve problems that take time for ordinary computers to solve with ingenuity.

Tatsumura Kosuke mentions that Toshiba is already working on joint research with automakers and demonstrations in the financial field.

Watabiki Ken explains that Toshiba Digital Solutions offers a solution called "SQBM+" for simulated branching machines, which targets IT drug discovery targeting proteins along with AOI Biosciences.

Goto points out that advanced calculations are still difficult to apply practically until a large-scale quantum computer is created.

The key to practical application is the high fidelity (precision) of two-qubit gates, which indicates the degree of match between ideal quantum gate operations and actual operations.

Toshiba has achieved 99.90% fidelity of two qubit gates in a joint research with the RIKEN Institute in 2024, based on new technology proposed by Toshiba.

Goto mentions that achieving higher accuracy is essential for practical use and their goal is 99.99%.

Once this accuracy is reached, it will be more efficient to use error correction, and there is a possibility that a quantum computer can work without using it.

Goto explains that at 99.99%, they can see the possibility of practical use.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump granted pardons to three co-founders of the BitMEX global cryptocurrency exchange, as well as to a former high-ranking employee of the company.

The co-founders, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed, and former head of business development Gregory Dwyer, previously pled guilty to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act related to failure to maintain anti-money laundering and know-your-customer programs.


The founders received criminal sentences of probation of varying lengths and were ordered to pay civil fines totaling $30 million related to a lawsuit by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Dwyer, who received a sentence of 18 months of probation, agreed to pay $150,000 in fines.

Prosecutors accused the men of effectively operating BitMEX as a "money laundering platform" and that its purported withdrawal from the U.S. market was "a sham."

Trump issued the pardons on Thursday, more than three months after BitMEX was sentenced to pay a fine of $100 million for violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to establish and maintain anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer programs.


Hayes, in a tweet on Friday, wrote, "Thank you POTUS," using the term for "President of the United States."


Delo, in a statement, said, "The US Department of Justice wrongfully targeted BitMEX and its co-founders."

"This full and unconditional pardon by President Trump is a vindication of the position we have always held – that BitMEX, my co-founders and I should never have been charged with a criminal offense through an obscure, antiquated law," Delo said.

As the most successful crypto exchange of its kind, we were wrongfully made to serve as an example, sacrificed for political reasons and used to send inconsistent regulatory signals."

I'm sincerely grateful to the President for granting this pardon to me and my co-founders," Delo said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So much depends on the weather — from small decisions like whether you'll need an umbrella for your commute, to critical ones like whether a farmer should lay down fertilizer or if there's a risk of heavy rains washing it away.

Coastal communities depend on fishing for sustenance and income, but sudden storms can endanger those at sea and their fishing boats. Seeking to help people answer these questions, teams at Google have been working on AI powered nowcasting for years, helping our users to understand exactly when and where they should expect precipitation over the next few hours.

Now, these short-term precipitation forecasts are being made available across Africa, for the first time. The forecasts are made possible through advancements in Google Research's AI-powered nowcasting model MetNet, which uses satellite data and ground observations to produce state-of-the-art precipitation forecasts in data-sparse regions of the world.

Solving the problem of sparse ground observations was a key challenge. One critical component for weather forecasts is dense ground radar, which is not available for the majority of the world where billions of people live. The need for new approaches and better weather forecasts is especially pronounced in Africa, where ground observations are limited and global weather models tend to exhibit low skill.

To scale nowcasting globally, our Research teams came up with an innovative new approach using globally available satellite observations in our nowcasting models. Using AI and satellite observations, the model was able to fill in the gaps, even in areas where radar was unavailable, overcoming previous limitations in data sparse regions. It is also our first model to directly incorporate observations from a multitude of satellites.</p>

The combination values XAI at $80 Billion and x at $33 Billion ($45B less $12B debt). The billionaire owner of XAI went on to describe the two companies' futures as "intertwined." 

He added, "Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution, and talent." The acquisition places x firmly under the umbrella of Musk's AI startup, which he founded in 2023 to compete with OpenAI.

Musk notes that this deal values x at $33 Billion (lowered from an Enterprise Valuation of $45B due to the company's $12B in debt). Musk originally purchased X for $44B in October 2022 and took it private.</p>

The market is tight, and now two trailblazers in the space are coming together as consolidation beckons. Willow, a San Francisco startup that made its name with wearable breast pumps, is acquiring Elvie, which started with a smart Kegel trainer before expanding to other products for new mothers.


Terms of the deal have not been disclosed but it's understood that Elvie has entered administration and raised over $186 million from investors including Octopus Ventures and BlackRock. Its last valuation was $241 million.

The companies have been in conversation for some time, after Willow approached Elvie to buy it. However, as talks progressed, Elvie also approached the end of its runway.

Willow is taking on the existing business, including its products and team, which currently consists of 170 people working across London and Bristol. Some employees are already working out their notice periods and won't be coming on to Willow.


For its part, Willow has raised around $254 million in a combination of equity and debt with investors including NEA and Meritech. Its valuation had risen to as much as $256 million in 2021 but had dropped in 2024 when the company raised a combination of equity and debt.

Elvie's entry into administration speaks to wider challenges in women’s health, which is estimated to be a $60 billion market this year. The market has been challenging for later-stage startups, especially those not focused on AI.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google will start offering user choice billing in the U.K. on March 29, initially only to non-game developers.

The change allows Google Play developers to use alternative billing options instead of Google's own system.

Developers who opt for an alternative billing option get a 4% discount from the fees they pay to Google.

Google typically gets a cut of up to 30% on in-app transactions and paid downloads.

In a blog post announcing the change, Google claimed that more than 90% of developers are "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with Google Play's native billing.

However, it added that some developers may want more choice in how they process payments.

Google's move is actually a long-awaited response to a Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation dating back to 2022.

The CMA published a report based on a year-long study of the mobile ecosystem, noting that both Google and Apple's power in the market could be subject to regulatory scrutiny.

Countries where Google already offers user choice billing include the U.S., India, Australia, Indonesia, Japan, and the European Economic Area (EEA), which all follow the same commissions and charges as in the U.K.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michael Intrator, Founder & CEO of CoreWeave, Inc., Nvidia-backed cloud services provider, gestures during the company's IPO at the Nasdaq Market, in New York City, U.S., March 28, 2025.

CoreWeave's stock opened at $39 and closed at $40 in its Nasdaq debut on Friday after the company sold shares at $40 a piece, below the expected range. The seller of artificial intelligence technology in the cloud raised $1.5 billion in its share sale, the biggest tech IPO in the U.S. since 2021.

 

The offering has captured the attention of investors from Wall Street to Silicon Valley, as CoreWeave represents the first pure-play AI IPO and the largest tech debut in the U.S. in four years. The IPO market has been largely shut since the end of 2021, as the tech industry reckoned with rising inflation and interest rates.

 

Tech stocks aren't doing CoreWeave any favors. The company hit the market on a day that the Nasdaq was off by almost 3%, heading for its worst quarterly performance since mid-2022. The tech-heavy index is down 10% so far this year.

 

As a supplier to OpenAI, CoreWeave is among the beneficiaries of the generative AI boom that began with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Microsoft, which provides cloud services to OpenAI, is CoreWeave's biggest customer, accounting for 62% of the company's $1.92 billion in revenue last year.

 

CoreWeave rents out access to hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units to other large tech and AI companies including Meta, IBM and Cohere. Its stiffest competition is coming from the top cloud vendors — Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Oracle.

 

CoreWeave reported a net loss of $863 million last year, with revenue soaring 737% from a year earlier. It's a capital-intensive business due to the high costs of renting out and operating data centers. CoreWeave has raised almost $13 billion in debt, with much of that allocated for GPUs that go inside the company's leased facilities in the U.S. and abroad.

 

After initially setting its price target at $47 to $55, with a plan to raise about $2.5 billion at the middle of the range, CoreWeave slimmed down the offering, a reflection of investor skepticism. "There's a lot of headwinds in the macro," CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said on CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Friday. "And we definitely had to scale or rightsize the transaction for where the buying interest was."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump granted pardons to three co-founders of BitMEX, as well as to a former high-ranking employee of the company.

The co-founders, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed, and former head of business development Gregory Dwyer, previously pled guilty to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act related to failure to maintain anti-money laundering and know-your-customer programs.


The founders received criminal sentences of probation of varying lengths and were ordered to pay civil fines totaling $30 million related to a lawsuit by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Dwyer, who received a sentence of 18 months of probation, agreed to pay $150,000 in fines.

Prosecutors accused the men of effectively operating BitMEX as a "money laundering platform" and that its purported withdrawal from the U.S. market was "a sham."


Trump issued the pardons on Thursday, more than three months after BitMEX was sentenced to pay a fine of $100 million for violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to establish and maintain anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer programs.

Hayes, in a tweet on Friday, wrote, "Thank you POTUS," using the term for "President of the United States." Delo, in a statement, said, "The US Department of Justice wrongfully targeted BitMEX and its co-founders."

"This full and unconditional pardon by President Trump is a vindication of the position we have always held – that BitMEX, my co-founders and I should never have been charged with a criminal offense through an obscure, antiquated law," Delo said.


Hayes, Delo and Reed founded BitMEX in 2014. Prosecutors said the executives knew that the exchange was required to implement an anti-money laundering plan because it served U.S. customers "but chose to flout those requirements, requiring only that customers provide an email address to use BitMEX's services."

"Indeed, senior executives each knew that customers residing in the U.S. continued to access BitMEX's trading platform through at least in or about 2018, and that BitMEX policies nominally in place to prevent such trading were toothless or easily overridden to serve BitMEX's bottom line goal of obtaining revenue through the U.S. market without regard to U.S. criminal laws,"</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.K.'s crypto industry has just over 12 months to prepare for an even stricter regulatory regime.

Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets at the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told CoinDesk in an interview that the "impending gateway regime" that is earmarked for 2026 will in fact be a new authorization regime for crypto companies.

"We will have a gateway which will allow authorization. But obviously we've got to go through those consultations, create those rules and get the legislation for that to take place," Long said.

This regime will be a leap from the current anti-money laundering (AML) one.

Firms like crypto exchanges Coinbase, Gemini and Bitpanda will move away from just needing to register with the country to comply with anti-money laundering rules to an authorization regime with rules for a suite of offerings.

This will require them to go through a fresh process to secure approval from the FCA.

The FCA intends to release papers on stablecoins, trading platforms, staking, prudential crypto exposure and more this year.

The regime is expected to go live after final policy papers are published in 2026, Long said.

Since its anti-money laundering register for firms opened in 2020, the FCA received 368 applications from firms wishing to comply, but only 50 firms — 14% of applicants — have been approved so far.

Many firms may have to start again.

Regulated activities will be defined by upcoming legislation, Long said. Companies that engage in those activities will need to seek authorization.

In 2023 the former U.K. government released papers that said regulated activities would likely include crypto and fiat-referenced stablecoins issuance as well as payment, exchange and lending activities.

The FCA plans to consult on draft rules for stablecoins early this year.

"What we're doing in terms of the stablecoins is we're making sure that we take the best from the current regulation that exists in TradFi, but stablecoins are ultimately unique," Long said.

"There isn't anything that is exactly the same. We've got to adapt the regulation that we've currently got."

The FCA is still deciding on the process crypto companies will need to go through to get authorized, Long said.

Long added that it was undecided what steps those who are already registered in the money laundering regime will need to take but the new regime will come with wider permissions.</p>

The social media platform has struggled to recover since an earnings report in February showed that it is failing to keep up with larger digital advertising peers such as Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which have higher user figures. Reddit’s outlook seemed precarious because its US traffic took a hit from a change in Google’s search algorithm.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Normally retailing for $699, the Pixel 8 offers a flagship-level experience with Google's latest AI and machine learning features.

With fast performance, amazing cameras, and Google's Actua display, it's one of the best smartphone deals available.


Compared to similarly priced phones, like the Nothing Phone 2, the Pixel 8 is a far better value. As part of Amazon's 2025 Spring Sale, Google's base Pixel 8 in Obsidian (black) has received a 30% discount. Its price has dropped from $700 to just $487. Other color options, like the Pixel 8 in Hazel, are on sale too, although the price drop isn't as deep.

The Google Pixel 9 might be getting all the attention nowadays (especially with its access to Google's new Gemini AI model), but the standard Pixel 8 is still an impressive model among the rest of Google's smartphone catalog. Because it balances performance and cost so well, the Pixel 8 is difficult to ignore and perhaps the only phone you should consider if you're shopping on a budget.

You won't find another phone like it under $500, and it's only when you sift through the $800-$1,000 options that you find commendable competition. A big reason for this is the Pixel 8's Tensor processor, which provides speedy performance without breaking the bank.

A big reason for this is the Pixel 8's Tensor processor, which provides speedy performance without breaking the bank. You also get seven full years of software support from Google, which means you'll get updates until 2030 if you buy this phone.

The company guarantees seven full years of software support, which means you'll get updates until 2030 if you buy this phone. That's unheard of for an Android phone, and it gives devices like the iPhone a run for their money.

Thanks to the 4,575mAh cell inside, the Pixel 8 can also last all day on a charge. With my medium to heavy usage, I typically end days with 30-40% in the tank, which means anyone using the phone a bit less could stretch it out to last a day and a half.

The Pixel 8 still gets pretty warm after being used for a while, but that's typical with Google's Tensor processors. I also wish there was a proper telephoto camera on the back; Super Res Zoom is handy for upscaling digitally zoomed photos, but it can only take you so far.

Oh, and I still don't trust Face Unlock; Google lets you use it to pay for things now using Google Pay, but it still relies on a flat image of your face to authenticate you.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When British doctor Ahmed Kerwan began working as a physician, the paperwork burden shocked him.

There are already dozens, perhaps hundreds, of startups using AI to reduce the notoriously complex admin burden in healthcare.


Kerwan, now an entrepreneur, is the founder and CEO of one such company, called Taxo. His startup offers an app that doctors and others use for tasks like getting prior authorizations from insurers, patient intake, and medical billing.

What sets Taxo apart, Kerwan says, is its AI “reasoning engine,” which transparently explains the process behind its decisions to users, helping it build trust with doctors.

Taxo built its “reasoning engine” by adding a healthcare-specific layer on top of existing models like OpenAI’s and Anthropic’s. 

The reasoning trend in AI remains early and only really gained traction with the rise of Chinese startup DeepSeek.

Kerwan told TechCrunch that investor interest in Taxo suggests there’s a chance for the technique to gain broader adoption beyond foundational AI companies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trevor Milton, the founder of Nikola, has been pardoned by President Trump.

The White House confirmed to TechCrunch that the pardon was granted. 

Milton was convicted in October 2022 of one count of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud related to claims he made about Nikola's progress to investors. He was sentenced to four years in prison in December 2023.

He has been out on a $100 million bond while he appealed that sentence. The pardon comes just weeks after Nikola filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

The company had hoped to close a deal by mid-April and was working with the bankruptcy court in Delaware. 

"It is no wonder why trust and confidence in the justice department has eroded to nothing," Milton said in a statement.

Milton plans to release a documentary that he believes will tell his side of the Nikola story. He founded Nikola in 2014, but it didn't enter the spotlight until 2020 when it became one of the first electric vehicle companies to go public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).

The company quickly became a hotly traded stock after General Motors announced a $2 billion stake in September 2020. Just days later, short-selling research firm Hindenburg Research published a report containing allegations of fraud perpetrated by Milton.

Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York charged Milton in July 2021, claiming that he had made "false and misleading statements regarding Nikola's product and technology development" on social media and in TV, print, and podcast interviews.</p>

The company intentionally waited until after the Nintendo Direct livestream to make the announcement, encouraging fans to download its new app, Nintendo Today!, to learn the latest news. During Thursday's Nintendo Direct event, game director Shigeru Miyamoto closed out the presentation by announcing the Nintendo Today! news app.

 

Nintendo investing in existing IP has proven a financially sound strategy. Its "Super Mario Bros." movie grossed $1.3 billion at the box office with a $100 million production budget, making it the 18th-highest grossing global release of all time. The "Breath of the Wild" game sold more than 34 million copies, more than the Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal games.</p>

A little bird recently told us that Lucid is eyeing partnerships as a way to reach higher levels of autonomy, particularly with the new Gravity SUV. Could we see a partnership with Mobileye or some other unlikely automated driving technology provider?

Welp, here is a deal that is not transportation related, but very much deserves some attention.

TechCrunch was acquired by private investment firm Regent.

Other deals that got my attention … BetterFleet, the Michigan-based company that developed EV charging fleet management software, raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by Aligned Climate Capital, Ecosystem Integrity Fund (EIF), and Remarkable Ventures Climate (RVC). 

The Bot Company, the robotics startup founded by former Cruise co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt, has raised $150 million in a round led by Greenoaks.

DeCharge, an EV charging infrastructure startup, raised $2.5 million in a round led by Lemniscap. Other investors include Colosseum, Daedalus Angels, EV3 Labs, Echo Fundraiser Chainyoda Jedis, and Levitate Labs.

Fleetio, a vehicle fleet software management company, raised $450 million in a round co-led by Elephant VC and Goldman Sachs Alternatives.

Manna, the Dublin-based drone delivery company, raised $30 million in a round led by Tapestry VC and Molten Ventures. Coca-Cola and Dynama Venture also participated.

Autonomous vehicles

Waymo will begin offering robotaxi rides in Washington, D.C., via the Waymo One app in 2026. There is an important catch: Before Waymo can launch commercially, the company will have to up its lobbying game in the capital, where autonomous vehicle permits still require a human behind the wheel.

Electric vehicles, charging, & batteries

BYD’s breakthrough EV-charging announcement last week prompted reporter Tim De Chant to find out more.

Cadillac debuted another EV: the Optiq SUV. Contributor Emme Hall got a chance to drive the Optiq and the new Escalade IQ.

Revel, the Brooklyn-based electric vehicle charging infrastructure startup, launched its first fast-charging station in San Francisco.

Rivian operated a skunkworks program for years focused on electric micromobility, founder and CEO RJ Scaringe told TechCrunch. Now, Rivian is spinning out the startup — known as Also — with $105 million in funding from Eclipse Ventures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Welcome to Startups Weekly — your weekly recap of everything you can’t miss from the world of startups.

The startup news this week was very much a mixed bag, with one public exit finalized and another delayed and a flurry of other developments, both promising and disappointing.


Churn concerns: TechCrunch learned that several companies with logos on 11x’s website were not actual customers of the a16z- and Benchmark-backed startup. Sources also said used 11x used creative ways to calculate annual recurring revenue.

Further delays: Cerebras Systems saw its IPO delayed again. The AI chipmaker filed to go public in 2024, but its national security review has been dragging on.


Nuclear: Terrestrial Energy, a U.S. nuclear startup that develops small modular reactors, went public via SPAC and is expecting to net $280 million. Meanwhile, Bill Gates-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems hit a key milestone to construct its demonstration reactor.

Not enough: Vertical farming company Plenty filed for bankruptcy after raising nearly $1 billion in funding from investors, including SoftBank Investment Advisers, Walmart, Bezos Expeditions, and Jeff Bezos as an angel investor.


Layoffs: Block, the fintech startup co-founded by Jack Dorsey, laid off 931 people, according to a leaked email. The company, which owns Cash App and Square, already conducted layoffs in 2024.

Rumors: Nvidia is reportedly nearing a deal to acquire Lepton AI, a startup that rents out servers powered by its AI chips. And FuriosaAI, a South Korean startup that makes chips for AI applications, is said to have rejected an $800 million acquisition offer from Meta.


Most interesting VC and funding news this week

From pre-seed to a Series E, here are some rounds that caught our attention this week. Plus, some fresh funding for VCs to invest in new deals.

Hot thermometer: Digital banking startup Mercury raised $300 million in primary and secondary funding, including a Series C led by Sequoia. This also more than doubled its valuation to $3.5 billion post-money.


Valuation bump: Island, a company that makes enterprise browsers, secured $250 million in a Series E led by Coatue that valued the Dallas-based startup at $4.85 billion — a significant valuation bump less than one year after its previous round.

Also: Rivian spun out a new micromobility startup called Also, which already received $105 million from Eclipse Ventures. Its goal is to build small EVs, with a flagship product going into production next year for consumers in the U.S. and Europe.


Automated: Fast-growing Berlin-based workflow automation startup n8n raised $60 million in a round of funding led by Highland Europe, with HV Capital and previous investors Sequoia, Felicis, and Harpoon also participating. Sources said the valuation was close to $270 million.

Ramp for LatAm: Mexico City-based YC alum Mendel raised a $35 million Series B and expects its business to reach profitability by late 2025.


Arcade, a generative AI marketplace for designing jewelry, simultaneously announced its $25 million Series A funding round and its expansion to home goods, starting with rugs.

No free labor: Former Outreach CEO Manny Medina launched Paid, a new startup that has already raised $11 million in pre-seed funding to make sure AI agents get paid.


More AI: San Mateo, California-based Emergence Capital closed a $1 billion seventh fund to back B2B companies, with a keen interest in AI.

Blue checks: French VC firm Daphni announced the first closing of its third fund, Daphni Blue, with around $215 million secured out of its overall $270 million target.


Beyond voice: Amazon’s Alexa Fund expanded its scope beyond voice startups, with a broader focus on AI investments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Thursday, Amnesty International published a new report detailing attempted hacks against two Serbian journalists.

The two journalists, who work for the Serbia-based Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN), received suspicious text messages including a link — basically a phishing attack, according to the nonprofit.

Amnesty said its researchers were able to click on the link in a safe environment and see that it led to a domain that they had previously identified as belonging to NSO Group’s infrastructure.

Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, the head of Amnesty's Security Lab, told TechCrunch, "This technical research has allowed Amnesty to identify malicious websites used to deliver the Pegasus spyware, including the specific Pegasus domain used in this campaign."

Security researchers like Ó Cearbhaill who have been keeping tabs on NSO’s activities for years are now so good at spotting signs of the company’s spyware that sometimes all researchers have to do is quickly look at a domain involved in an attack.

NSO Group and its customers are losing their battle to stay in the shadows, according to John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab.

There is hard evidence proving what Ó Cearbhaill and Scott-Railton believe. In 2016, Citizen Lab published the first technical report ever documenting an attack carried out with Pegasus, which was against a United Arab Emirates dissident.

Since then, in less than 10 years, researchers have identified at least 130 people all over the world targeted or hacked with NSO Group’s spyware.

The Pegasus Project, a collective journalistic initiative to investigate abuse of NSO Group's spyware, was based on a leaked list of more than 50,000 phone numbers that were allegedly entered in an NSO Group targeting system.

Dozens of victims have been identified by Amnesty, Citizen Lab, and Access Now, another nonprofit that helps protect civil society from spyware attacks.</p>

Getting the Gravity into customer hands is a big milestone for Lucid, whose success will hinge on being able to offer vehicle types popular with American drivers.


The Gravity is Lucid’s second vehicle and its first SUV after the Lucid Air sedan series. Lucid opened up orders for the seven-seater SUV in November 2024 and began first deliveries to employees, friends, and family in December.

Lucid employees who spoke to TechCrunch at the event confirmed that the EV maker is busy ramping up Gravity production at its Casa Grande, Arizona factory.


The $94,900 Gravity has an official EPA range estimate of 450 miles and the performance of a sports car.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Brief

Mozilla has fixed a security bug in its Firefox for Windows browser that was “being exploited in the wild.”

In a brief update, Mozilla said it updated the browser to Firefox version 136.0.4 after identifying and fixing the new bug, tracked as CVE-2025-2857, which presents a “similar pattern” to a bug that Google patched in its Chrome browser earlier this week.

Anyone exploiting the bug could escape Firefox’s sandbox, which limits the browser’s access to other apps and data on the user’s computer.

The bug also affects other browsers with the same codebase as Firefox for Windows, such as the Tor Browser, which also received a patch updating the browser to 14.0.7.

Kaspersky researcher Boris Larin, who first discovered the Chrome zero-day, confirmed in a post that the root cause of the Chrome bug also affects Firefox. Kaspersky previously linked the use of the exploits to attacks on journalists, employees of educational institutions, and government organizations in Russia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mark Zuckerberg may not be the most likable figure in Silicon Valley, but we can empathize with him on this: It would feel really weird if someone made a movie about your life.

On the YouTube podcast Colin and Samir, Zuckerberg spoke about the one and only time he saw “The Social Network.”

“It was weird, man,” he said. “They got all these very specific details of what I was wearing, or these specific things correct, but then the whole narrative arc around my motivations and all this stuff were like, completely wrong.”

The 15-year-old movie only came up in conversation because Zuckerberg was wearing a T-shirt that Jesse Eisenberg wore when portraying the young founder on screen — Zuckerberg later bought the T-shirt at an auction. Although Zuckerberg used to be known for wearing plain grey T-shirts, he’s since paid a lot more attention to his style, so it’s likely that his T-shirt choice was not an accident.

Zuckerberg said that he knew his employees would be curious to see it anyway, so he arranged for the company to go watch it together.

“The whole arc is like, I’m somehow motivated by trying to find a girlfriend, [but] I was dating Priscilla before I started Facebook.”

Perhaps this portrayal of Zuckerberg stems from another notorious website he created while a student: Facemash, an app where students could vote on which of their classmates was the hottest. While the service was popular among some students, it angered others who felt it was a violation of their privacy; he had scraped his classmates’ student ID photos from private servers to make the site.

“It’s an unfortunate part of the internet, how people kind of make up a lot of the founding mythology to what they want,” Zuckerberg said.

He denies the idea that Facemash was a precursor to Facebook, claiming that after over two decades, people still link Facemash and Facebook due to “The Social Network.”

“I was just a kid,” Zuckerberg said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WhatsApp launched a new feature on Friday, where users can include brief music clips in their Status updates, reminiscent of the Myspace era.

Status resembles Instagram Stories and allows users to share photos, videos, and text that disappear after 24 hours. When creating a new Status, users can tap on a music note icon to choose from millions of available songs. They can post music clips of up to 15 seconds for photos and up to 60 seconds for videos.

The launch of music clips follows parent company Meta introducing similar capabilities to Instagram, where users can add songs to profiles, Notes, and posts.

WhatsApp’s feature is similar, but with a key difference: Music shared on Status is end-to-end encrypted, meaning only friends can see the songs. WhatsApp itself cannot view the songs that users share.

WhatsApp has started to roll out the new feature globally and will continue to expand availability over the coming weeks.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google will start offering user choice billing in the U.K., giving developers the ability to use other billing options instead of Google's own system.

The change kicks in on March 29, initially only to non-game developers.


Developers who opt to use an alternative billing option get a 4% discount from the fees they pay to Google (to account for the fees that third parties may also charge).


Google typically gets a cut of up to 30% on in-app transactions and paid downloads.

A blog post announcing the change stated that more than 90% of developers on its platform are "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with Google Play's native billing.


The move is a long-awaited response to a Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation dating back to 2022.

At that time, the competition watchdog published a report based on a year-long study of the mobile ecosystem, noting that both Google and Apple's power in the market could be subject to regulatory scrutiny.

Countries where Google already offers user choice billing include the U.S., India, Australia, Indonesia, Japan, and the European Economic Area (EEA), which all follow the same commissions and charges as in the U.K.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, OpenAI launched a new image generator in ChatGPT.

Beyond the pastel illustrations, GPT-4o’s native image generator significantly upgrades ChatGPT’s capabilities, improving picture editing, text rendering, and spatial representation.

OpenAI previously rejected prompts for images depicting public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features, but now allows these types of requests upon user permission.


We’re shifting from blanket refusals in sensitive areas to a more precise approach focused on preventing real-world harm,” said Joanne Jang. “The goal is to embrace humility: recognizing how much we don’t know, and positioning ourselves to adapt as we learn.”

These adjustments seem to be part of OpenAI’s larger plan to effectively “uncensor” ChatGPT.

Under the updated policy, ChatGPT can now generate and modify images of Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and other public figures that OpenAI did not previously allow.


OpenAI doesn’t want to be the arbiter of status, choosing who should and shouldn’t be allowed to be generated by ChatGPT. Instead, the company is giving users an opt-out option if they don’t want ChatGPT depicting them.

In a white paper released Tuesday, OpenAI also said it will allow ChatGPT users to “generate hateful symbols,” such as swastikas, in educational or neutral contexts, as long as they don’t “clearly praise or endorse extremist agendas.”

Moreover, OpenAI is changing how it defines “offensive” content. Jang says ChatGPT used to refuse requests around physical characteristics, such as “make this person’s eyes look more Asian” or “make this person heavier.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Tesla Takedown” organizers have promised their biggest day of global action this weekend, encouraging thousands to protest outside Tesla showrooms, dealerships, and even charging stations.

Activists holding up signs are being conflated with masked vandals throwing Molotov cocktails. On social media, and in Washington, the distinction is fading fast.

President Donald Trump has called attacks on Tesla “domestic terrorism” and threatened to send “terrorist thugs” to prisons in El Salvador.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has pledged to prosecute “those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes,” even though evidence suggests the attacks were carried out by “lone offenders.”

Musk’s decision to accuse at least one peaceful protester of “committing crimes” on X has fueled a public discourse that equates protest with vandalism, and vandalism with terrorism.

Mike German, a former FBI special agent, told TechCrunch that “terrorism is a problematic concept in law enforcement because it is by definition differentiated from other violence by its political nature.”

The Tesla Takedown protesters have consistently preached nonviolence at rallies and on their website. The movement’s stated goal is not to physically harm Tesla or Musk, but rather to encourage people to sell their Teslas, sell their stock, and stop buying new Teslas.

Natasha Purdum, a New Jersey-based organizer, said the reason they want to drive down Tesla's stock price is because it would hit Musk in his wealth, which is tied to his ownership of the company.

Musk owns roughly 13% of Tesla, which today is valued at around $829 billion, making Musk’s share worth around $107.8 billion.

As someone who spent 16 years as an FBI special agent focused on domestic terrorism, German says he wouldn’t be surprised to see local police working hand in glove with terrorism taskforces — like the one the FBI just formed — to monitor Tesla Takedown protests.

Law enforcement in the United States is primarily intended to protect the property of the wealthy, and corporations have access to elected officials and top law enforcement officials.

The FBI declined to comment on TechCrunch’s question about whether the agency is taking any special action this weekend.

Musk and the Trump administration have ramped up their rhetoric in the lead up to March 29, when at least 213 Tesla Takedown protests are scheduled around the world.</p>

Prolific fintech investor and QED Investors co-founder Frank Rotman said Friday that he will transition to a partner emeritus role by year’s end to focus on founding his own startups.

He plans to start a music industry business, which he has been developing in his head for years.

He started Alexandria, Virginia-based QED, with Nigel Morris and Caribou Honig nearly two decades ago. 

The firm today has $4 billion in assets under management and has backed companies such as Credit Karma and GreenSky.

Rotman will continue to serve in a part-time advisory role to QED over the coming years.

Besides founding music startups, Rotman said he likely plans to write a book centered around his “observations and frameworks for the startup and VC worlds.”

QED Managing Partner Nigel Morris noted that he and Rotman had worked together for over 30 years.

Amias Gerety will be promoted to lead QED’s U.S. investment team.

Rotman will transition to his new role on January 1, 2026</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk announced on X, formerly Twitter, that xAI has acquired X in an all-stock deal.

“xAI has acquired X in an all-stock transaction,” Musk said. “The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt).”

Musk went on to describe the two companies’ futures as “intertwined.” He added, “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent.”

The acquisition places X — the highly influential social media platform Musk purchased in 2022 under its former name, Twitter — firmly under the umbrella of Musk’s AI startup, which he founded in 2023 to compete with OpenAI.

Musk notes that this deal values X at $33 billion (lowered from an enterprise value of $45 billion due to the company’s $12 billion in debt). 

Musk originally purchased X for $44 billion in October 2022 and took it private. However, the valuation has swung dramatically in recent years.

At one point, Fidelity valued X at less than $10 billion.

In the months since the inauguration of President Donald Trump — for whom Musk campaigned for aggressively — X’s valuation has risen, largely because investors believe the platform more influential now.

Musk said in his post on Friday that X now has more than 600 million active users.

Musk launched xAI in 2023 and has since beefed up the startup with industry leading AI researchers from Google DeepMind, Microsoft, and OpenAI, and built out the massive AI data centers to catch up with other frontier AI developers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Using Signal on regular devices connected to the Internet means that communication content can be exposed not only to those who exploit the Signal vulnerability, but also to those who can hack devices such as iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, etc.

That is why it is customary for US government agencies, especially the Department of Defense, to operate on federal government-only devices with strictly controlled software and functions used. What's more problematic than what was discussed in Signal this time is the fact that there was an exchange of highly sensitive military operations using inappropriate devices and apps.

Message disappearing function

One of the reasons why public communications apps such as Signal and WhatsApp aren't suitable for government confidential work is the ability to remove messages. This system automatically deletes messages after a preset time, which is incompatible with federal laws regarding record management.

According to a screenshot released on the 26th by The Atlantic, the group chat about the Yemen airstrikes initially set an automatic message deletion timer for one week, but later changed to four weeks due to Michael Waltz's account. If Goldberg had not been incorrectly invited, it could have been that the content would have disappeared without fulfilling its obligation to keep the record.

"Signals may be pre-installed on government terminals," Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, said in parliamentary testimony. However, sources have told WIRED that this is an exceptional case, particularly with the Department of Defense devices being severely restricted to the adoption of consumer apps.

The fact that Hegses was involved in the chat indicates that he could have introduced Signal with special permission, omitted the regulations, or used privately owned, non-official devices. Political consultant FP Wellman said last month that Pentagon's "political appointees" called for the introduction of Signals to government devices.

The Trump administration has argued that "the conversations on Signal didn't contain any sensitive information." It is certainly said that the authority to classify information is to Hegses, Secretary of Defense himself. However, several sources point out that "this does not mean that consumer apps are the right place for discussion."

Andy Jabour, a former US Army service member and founder of risk management company Gate 15, said: "The exchange didn't have any official designations like "official use only." That said, it was extremely sensitive operational information that would normally be unthinkable for soldiers and officers to make it public. And the chat included people from the press."

Military officials receive training in information security and handling every year, and are said to be thoroughly handled with private information. Many people believe that the information handled in the chat about the Yemeni airstrikes was sufficiently at a confidential level, even if it was not officially classified as confidential.

"We're a sought after," Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner said during a Senate Special Committee on Intelligence. "To begin with, leaving aside the fact that sensitive information should not be discussed on non-confidential systems, the executives who joined the group didn't even know who was in the chat. This is a fundamental fundamental of security, so to be honest, it's hard to believe."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk said on Friday that his startup xAI has merged with X, his social network, in an all-stock transaction.

He added that the merger would "unlock immense potential by blending xAI's advanced AI capability and expertise with X's massive reach."

Musk wrote in a post on X, "xAI and X's futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent."


Because both companies are privately held and controlled by Musk, the transaction likely amounts to a stock swap, with X investors getting paid out in xAI shares.

The companies have a number of mutual investors, including venture firms Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, as well as Fidelity Management, Vy Capital and Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holding Co.


Linda Yaccarino, who Musk hired as CEO of X, wrote in a post after Friday's announcement, "The future could not be brighter."


Musk launched xAI less than two years ago with a stated goal to "understand the true nature of the universe."


The startup has been trying to compete directly with OpenAI, the richly valued AI startup that Musk co-founded in 2015 as a non-profit research lab.


He later left OpenAI and has recently been involved in a public relations and legal spat with the company and CEO Sam Altman over the direction that it's taken.


xAI's team has been developing large language models and AI software products, taking on offerings from OpenAI as well as Google , Microsoft , Meta and others.

X and xAI have already been intertwined, with xAI's Grok chatbot available to users of the social media app.

In June, xAI announced it would build a supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, to train Grok. And in September, Musk revealed part of the Memphis supercomputer, now known as Colossus, was already online.


Investors valued xAI at around $50 billion in a financing round last year.

OpenAI was closed to wrapping up a round in February at a $260 billion valuation, while generative AI startup Anthropic was valued at $61.5 billion in a deal that closed this month.


In addition to running Tesla, SpaceX and xAI and overseeing X, Musk has spent much of his time this year in Washington, D.C., as a central figure in President Donald Trump's second administration.


After contributing $270 million to help Trump and other Republican candidates and causes in the 2024 campaign, Musk was put in charge of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).


This isn't the first time Musk has merged two of his entities. In 2016, Tesla acquired SolarCity for $2.6 billion.

The solar installer was founded by his first cousins, Lyndon and Peter Rive, and funded by Musk, who served as board chair.</p>
