PET imaging shows that the brain increases dopamine production when completing cognitively demanding tasks, and that the more dopamine released, the more efficiently the tasks are completed. Armed with this information, physicians may soon be able to develop more precise treatment strategies for neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Cognitive flexibility is the ability to adapt one's thinking and behavior appropriately to a changing environment and is considered an aspect of executive function. Cognitive flexibility differs among people and is reported to be impaired in several psychiatric and neurologic disorders, such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, addiction, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

At the neurotransmitter level, the dopamine system has been linked to cognitive flexibility. A direct neurochemical response to cognitive flexibility, however, has yet to be shown. In our study, we sought to examine the release of dopamine in real-time by performing PET scans while individuals completed behavioral flexibility tasks."" Isabelle Miederer, PhD, associate professor in experimental nuclear medicine in the department of nuclear medicine at University Medical Center Mainz, Germany

Eighteen participants were scanned with the D 2/3 receptor ligand 18F-fallypride in a two-part block study design. In the first part, participants performed two tasks consecutively on a computer screen without rule switching while undergoing PET imaging. In the second part of the PET scan, participants had to switch flexibly between two task rules. Dopamine release was calculated using the linearized simplified reference region model which compares the two task blocks with each other.

PET imaging analysis showed a displacement of 18F-fallypride in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during the task switching (higher cognitive demand) part of the study, which is assumed to be the release of dopamine. Results also showed that the greater dopamine release, the more efficient participants were in switching between tasks.

""The present findings emphasize the significance of dopamine in cognitive flexibility,"" said Mathias Schreckenberger, MD, head of the department of nuclear medicine at University Medical Center Mainz. ""They are consistent with the results of previous clinical studies indicating that dopamine deficiency in disorders such as Parkinson's disease may cause behavioral deficits in cognitive flexibility.""

""Looking forward, it is expected that the results of the study will contribute to a better understanding of the neurochemical mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility and thus facilitate the development of treatment strategies to improve flexibility in neurological and psychiatric disorders,"" he continued.",news-medical
https://news-medical.net,Material from nasal lavage provides a basis for assessing COPD,https://news-medical.net/news/20250328/Protein-In-The-Nose-Provides-Information-About-COPD.aspx,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Early diagnosis of COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, increases the quality of life of the patient and the efficacy of available treatments. Researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have now shown that material from nasal lavage provides a basis for assessing COPD. The study, which has been published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, could lead to a simple diagnostic method for early assessment of COPD.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects ten percent of the population and is the fourth most common cause of death in the world. The disease is mainly caused by smoke from biomass and the patient group is very heterogeneous in terms of symptoms and prognosis.



This means that the medical needs vary greatly, while today's examination methods are neither sufficient nor useful for assessing the large number of patients. Therefore, simple and safe methods that work at the individual level are needed.

Immune cells in the nose

Researchers at Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital have now shown that elevated levels of the protein interleukin-26 (IL-26) in the nose of smokers with and without COPD can be used to assess patients with an early phase of the disease.



IL-26 is a so-called cytokine that is important for cell communication in the immune system. An interesting property of IL-26 is that this cytokine has a direct inhibitory effect on bacteria and viruses.



Cytokines can influence inflammation and immune responses, and IL-26 has previously been linked to various inflammatory diseases, including COPD. In COPD, the levels of IL-26 in the lower respiratory tract have been shown to be elevated.



In the current study, the researchers have focused on understanding how IL-26 is produced in the nose of smokers and what the levels say about the individual COPD patient.

We have discovered that IL-26 is produced in greater amounts in the nose of smokers with COPD compared to non-smokers, while smokers without COPD showed a tendency towards increased levels. This suggests that IL-26 may be an important factor in the inflammatory process underlying COPD."" Julia Arebro, study's first author, researcher at the Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Karolinska Institutet, and physician at Karolinska University Hospital

A simple nasal lavage

The study included 50 research participants; active habitual smokers with and without COPD, as well as a control group of healthy non-smokers. Patients with other lung diseases were excluded from the study.



Among other things, the study participants underwent a simple nasal lavage so that the researchers could analyse the presence of IL-26 in the nose. The measured levels were found to reflect inflammation of the lower respiratory tract but also symptoms and other clinical findings in COPD.



""This opens up an easier way to characterize COPD patients without having to examine their lower airways with methods that are resource-intensive and involve medical risks,"" says Julia Arebro.

New treatment strategies

The study also shows that T cells, a type of white blood cell in the immune system, are involved in the production of IL-26 in the nose.



""Our results support that IL-26 contributes to the chronic inflammation that is typical for COPD. This may open up for new treatment strategies that target IL-26 to reduce inflammation and improve the quality of life for patients with COPD,"" says Anders Lindén, professor at the Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, and senior physician at Karolinska University Hospital who has led the research team behind the study.



The study was conducted in patients with mild to moderate COPD. In a next step, the researchers are planning a similar study on COPD, but in later stages. If future work confirms current results, the researchers believe that the method for easily estimating patients with COPD can be implemented within the next few years.

Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine showed that lipid accumulation in tumor cells and nearby immune cells promotes immune suppression, but disrupting lipid formulation reverses treatment resistance and the immunosuppressive microenvironment.

Standard-of-care treatment for TNBC includes chemotherapy and immunotherapy. However, some initially responsive tumors still develop recurrences. Researchers studied mouse models and found that TNBC cells that survived treatment accumulated lipid droplets containing Omega-6 fatty acids. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, near the tumor cells also accumulated these lipids.

""We found the tumor cells give the lipid droplets to surrounding neutrophils. This shifted the function of the neutrophils from antitumor to tumor promotion,"" said first author Dr. Liqun Yu, postdoctoral fellow in the Zhang lab at Baylor.

""The prevailing perspective in our field has focused on the role of fatty acid metabolism in regulating the immune response and therapeutic response. We found in this study that not only can fatty acids serve as an energy source, but they also are precursors of immunosuppressive signals the cancer cells can use to fight against our immune system,"" said corresponding author Dr. Xiang H.-F. Zhang, director of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center and professor of molecular and cellular biology at Baylor.

Researchers found they could reverse therapy resistance and the immunosuppressive microenvironment by disrupting lipid droplet formation. Blocking dietary intake of Omega-6 fatty acids also resensitized the tumors to chemotherapy and immunotherapy treatments.

We can advise patients to consume a diet low in Omega-6 fatty acids, which is not significantly different from the general advice to lower red meat, fat and sodium intake. We also are exploring therapeutic options to block fatty acid accumulation and immunosuppressive signals between the cancer cells and the neutrophils."" Zhang, William T.

https://news-medical.net,Study finds 24-hour fasting cycles enhance libido in male mice,https://news-medical.net/news/20250328/Study-finds-24-hour-fasting-cycles-enhance-libido-in-male-mice.aspx,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Long-term fasting in 24-hour cycles increases the sex drive of male mice by lowering the concentration of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. This effect is linked to a diet-induced deficiency of the precursor substance tryptophan – an amino acid that must be obtained through food. Researchers from DZNE report on this in the journal Cell Metabolism, together with a Chinese team from Qingdao University and the University of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. They suggest that similar mechanisms may exist in humans and view fasting as a potential approach for treating unwanted loss of sexual desire.

Fasting is a recurring subject of research because reduced food intake and thus calorie restriction has a variety of effects on the organism beyond the commonly observed weight loss. Dr. Dan Ehninger, research group leader at DZNE and lead author of the current study, and his team have also been working on this topic for quite some time.

""We are interested in the effects of fasting on aging. Using mice as a model, we investigate the underlying biological mechanisms. Our aim is to gain insights that may also be relevant to humans,"" says the Bonn-based scientist.

More offspring than expected

The research results now published are based on a fortuitous discovery, as Ehninger and his colleagues had originally set out to investigate something else. Their aim was to examine how fasting affects the offspring of male mice. However, one particular finding steered their research in a new direction: aged male mice – senior individuals by human standards – that had fasted for extended periods produced an unusually large number of offspring. Contrary to initial hypotheses, this phenomenon was not due to fasting effects on reproductive organs or the endocrine state of the animals. Age-related changes in the testes, reduced sperm quality and lower testosterone levels, for example, argued against high fertility. ""It was a bit of detective work to uncover the real cause,"" says Ehninger, whose research group collaborated on the current study with experts from Qingdao University and the University of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences led by Prof. Yu Zhou. ""Eventually, we realized: it is a matter of behavior. The fasting males had significantly more sexual contacts than mice that could eat freely. In other words, these animals had an unusually high frequency of mating and, as a result, an unusually high number of offspring for their age. Their mating behavior more than compensated for the age-related physiological limitations.""

Fasting in a 24-hour rhythm

Starting at two months of age, these male mice were subjected to a specific form of intermittent fasting. Their access to food followed a recurring 24-hour pattern: the animals were allowed to feed ad libitum for 24 hours, followed by 24 hours with access to water only. During the 22-month fasting regimen, the males were housed together without any contact with females. They were later introduced to three-month-old females that had been raised without dietary restrictions.

Effect takes time

Increased mating behavior was also observed in younger mice. These males had also started intermittent fasting at the age of two months, but had followed this diet for only six months before being introduced to females. They, too, were more sexually active than age-matched peers that had been fed ad libitum. However, the effect was absent in other experimental groups – both young and old – that fasted for only a few weeks.

""For intermittent fasting to increase sex drive, it takes some time,"" says Zhou. ""Based on our experiments, the minimum duration appears to be somewhere between six weeks and six months.""

A question of serotonin

In the course of investigating the causes, the attention eventually turned to neurotransmitters that influence sexual behavior. Some have a stimulating effect, while others act as inhibitors. Among the sexually active male mice, one factor stood out: serotonin – a chemical messenger generally associated with inhibitory effects – was present at unusually low levels.

These mice were, so to speak, sexually uninhibited, the usual regulatory restraint was diminished."" Dr. Dan Ehninger, research group leader at DZNE

Serotonin is primarily produced in the gastrointestinal tract, but also in the brain, where it acts as a neurotransmitter mediating communication between neurons. However, its synthesis depends on the amino acid tryptophan, which must be obtained through the diet or released through the breakdown of the body's own protein stores, such as those found in muscle tissue. Tryptophan is considered an essential amino acid, meaning that neither mice nor humans can synthesize it on their own. As a result, dietary intake plays a key role in regulating tryptophan levels in the body. It is, in fact, found in many common foods. ""The lack of serotonin was clearly a result of fasting,"" explains the DZNE researcher.

Is the fasting regimen relevant?

""All in all, the fasting mice consumed almost fifteen percent fewer calories than the animals in the control group. This also roughly applies to their intake of tryptophan,"" says Zhou. ""However, it is currently unclear whether the reduction in serotonin levels is linked to our specific feeding regimen or would also occur with other types of fasting. Future studies will need to clarify this."" As the scientist notes, it is also possible that the effect could occur under a general caloric restriction, where food is continuously available but in reduced amounts.

A potential approach for therapy

""Chemical messengers also play an important role in regulating sexual behavior in humans. This applies in particular to serotonin,"" says Ehninger. As he points out, this is evident, for example, in the use of SSRIs, a class of antidepressant drugs that increase serotonin levels. A potential side effect of this therapy is reduced libido. Conversely, lower serotonin levels are known to promote sexual desire. ""In view of this, I consider it very plausible that sexual desire in humans can be influenced by fasting – possibly not only in men, but also in women, since serotonin affects their libido as well."" According to Ehninger, there are actually only a few scientific studies on the effects of fasting on human libido. ""In my opinion, it would make sense to investigate this in more detail. I see potential for therapeutic application. A lack of sexual desire is not necessarily perceived as problematic – but some people suffer from it. This condition is known as 'hypoactive sexual desire disorder' and particularly affects older adults. Fasting could potentially serve as a useful addition to existing treatment options.""",news-medical
https://news-medical.net,Scientists develop lab model to study TDP-43 accumulation in neurodegeneration,https://news-medical.net/news/20250328/Scientists-develop-lab-model-to-study-TDP-43-accumulation-in-neurodegeneration.aspx,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Accumulation of a protein called TDP-43 is a key feature of ALS and frontotemporal dementia. In a newly published study, researchers report 'seeding' this accumulation through fragments of the culprit protein created in the lab. The findings provide further evidence for a prion-like paradigm wherein protein aggregation occurs in a templated fashion. This breakthrough provides the research field with a powerful way to model and study the mechanisms driving neurodegeneration.

TAR DNA-binding protein 43, better known as TDP-43, is a protein found in almost all human cells, where it plays essential roles in regulating gene expression, RNA processing, and cellular stress responses. Under normal conditions, TDP-43 helps maintain the health and function of neurons by controlling which genes are turned on or off and how their messages are translated into proteins.

However, TDP-43 is infamous for its role in several neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS and frontotemporal dementia, but also Alzheimer's disease.

From the nucleus to the cytoplasm

""TDP-43 pathology is considered a defining feature in nearly all ALS cases and about half of frontotemporal dementia cases,"" explains professor Sandrine Da Cruz, group leader at the VIB-KU Leuven Center for Brain & Disease Research. ""In the brains of these patients, TDP-43 somehow mislocalizes, accumulates in the cytoplasm where it forms insoluble inclusions, and is depleted from the nucleus.""

Despite its critical role, the exact processes driving TDP-43 dysfunction remain poorly understood—an urgent gap that researchers like Da Cruz are actively working to fill. The havoc and widespread neuronal death that ensues following TDP-43 mislocalization is most likely due to a combination of both disruption of TDP-43's normal activities within the nucleus as well as the toxic effect of the cytoplasmic inclusions.

""Part of the reason why the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood is that we lack model systems that reliably recapitulate both the nuclear depletion of TDP-43 and its cytoplasmic aggregation,"" says Da Cruz.

Seeds for aggregation

Building on recent reports that autopsied brain material from patients with TDP-43 inclusions can induce accumulation of insoluble TDP-43 in cells and transgenic mouse models, Da Cruz and her team sought a way to reproduce this so-called aggregation 'seeding' in the lab.

In a study recently published in Neuron, Da Cruz's team describes how they produced amyloid-like fibrils from a fragment of TDP-43 and that these fibrils trigger TDP-43 pathology in human cells, including iPSC-derived neurons.

The fibril-induced inclusions recapitulate many of the key hallmarks seen in patients, explains PhD student Jens Rummens: ""The TDP-43 aggregates induced by the fibrils exhibited many of the modifications we also see in patient brains, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Strikingly, the aggregates were able to recruit endogenous TDP-43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.""

The similarities extended to other downstream effects, as the team identified signature gene activity patterns that were previously linked to both aggregation and nuclear loss of TDP-43. The aggregates themselves exhibited the same heterogeneity in morphology as typically seen in patients over time.

Tool for research

The new results strongly suggest that pathology in TDP-43 proteinopathies propagates in a self-templating and prion-like fashion, but many questions remain unanswered. How is TDP-43 'trapped in the aggregates? What do they consist of and how do they trigger toxicity? Which additional 'hits' are required? What are the effects of TDP-43 mutations? Of age?

So perhaps most importantly, the new study provides scientists with the actual tools to study the different triggers and complex interplay in a controlled system.

Da Cruz: ""We have developed a valuable model that displays both aspects of TDP-43 pathology—cytoplasmic aggregation and nuclear depletion. This will be a powerful asset to help researchers across the globe to further unravel TDP-43 induced disease mechanisms and enable us to screen potential drug candidates that modify disease progression.""",news-medical

A growing body of research has drawn connections between everyday discrimination-the routine and often subtle forms of mistreatment that people experience on a day-to-day basis-and poor mental health. A new study by Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH) and Brown University suggests that higher exposure to discrimination increases a person's chances of developing depression and/or anxiety, and that this outcome varies by race and ethnicity.

Published in JAMA Network Open, the study found that over half of US adults experienced some form of discrimination, and individuals with high exposure to discrimination have more than five times the chances of screening positive for depression, and five times the chances of screening positive for anxiety. Compared to adults who do not experience discrimination, adults who do experience this mistreatment have nearly nine times the odds of screening positive for both depression and anxiety.

These observations were similar for men and women, but more pronounced among multiracial, White, and Asian adults, populations that are often overlooked in research and discussions about the effect of discrimination on health.

The nationally representative findings provide valuable insight into the relationship between discrimination and mental health among multiple populations, building upon previous research on this subject that has been restricted by smaller study groups or limited comparisons between Black and White populations, or Hispanic or Latino and non-Hispanic or non-Latino populations. The researchers hope this data provides a deeper understanding of the mental health consequences of discrimination among a wider range of demographic groups, and encourages mental health screenings and support to mitigate these racial disparities.

Our study expands our understanding beyond typical Black-White comparisons, showing that everyday discrimination is a widespread issue that negatively impacts mental health across all racial and ethnic groups."" Dr. Monica Wang, study lead and corresponding author, associate professor of community health sciences at BUSPH

For the study, Dr. Wang and study senior author Dr. Marie-Rachelle Narcisse, assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown, assessed 2023 national survey data to gauge experiences of discrimination, depression, and anxiety among nearly 30,000 adults ages 18 or older. This sample population was weighted to represent more than 258 million US adults. To measure discrimination, the researchers utilized standardized scales that capture the frequency of mistreatment, such as receiving poor service or being harassed. They also utilized standardized scales to quantify experiences with depression (such as feeling down or hopeless, or having little interest in doing things) and anxiety (such as feeling nervous or experiencing an inability to stop worrying).

Nearly 56 percent of adults experienced a form of discrimination, and 3.6 percent of this group reported experiencing high levels of discrimination, most prevalent among Black adults, followed by multiracial or other adults, Hispanic or Latino adults, White adults, and Asian adults. Discrimination was also more common among adults experiencing certain health disadvantages such as disabilities, obesity, and food insecurity, as well as immigrants and women.

The researchers theorize that a combination of social, cultural, and systemic factors may be driving discrimination-related depression or anxiety among specific racial and ethnic groups. Multiracial individuals may navigate unique experiences of mistreatment based on their multiple racial identities, while White individuals may experience mental health challenges that stem from mistreatment related to their income or educational levels. Asian adults may experience depression or anxiety stemming from language barriers or the ""model minority"" stereotype, which assumes all Asian individuals are high-achieving and successful.

These perceived experiences carry real psychological weight, says Dr. Narcisse.

""Studies have shown that discrimination shapes mental health most deeply when left unacknowledged,"" she says. I hope this study creates more awareness. As in awareness, there is strength and the ability to seek healing more intentionally.""

Dr. Wang and Dr. Narcisse also caution that these findings do not suggest that discriminatory experiences and any related adverse mental health problems are less significant among Black, Hispanic, and Latino populations, as these groups continue to experience multiple health challenges driven by systemic racism and a long history of oppression.

""Our results are a powerful reminder that discrimination is everyone's issue-and addressing it benefits society as a whole,"" Dr. Wang says.

Glowing Promises, Mixed Results

Can shining a red light on your skin improve your sleep, heal your muscles, and make you look younger? Red light therapy (RLT), once confined to medical clinics and elite sports facilities, is now a booming industry, promising benefits that sound almost too good to be true. But does the science support these claims, or is it just another wellness trend?

​Red light therapy, also known as low-level laser therapy (LLLT), utilizes low-level red or near-infrared light to stimulate cellular function and tissue healing. Originally researched by NASA to enhance plant growth and accelerate wound healing in astronauts, RLT has since been explored for multiple medical applications.1

In dermatology, RLT is recognized for its potential to improve skin health by reducing wrinkles, scars, and acne through collagen stimulation and increased blood circulation. Additionally, it may aid in wound healing and alleviate inflammation associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis and tendinitis.2

However, the scientific evidence supporting these claims varies, requiring a critical evaluation of its effectiveness and the need to distinguish between medically approved devices and over-the-counter consumer products.

This article assesses the current research, mechanisms of action, and commercial growth of RLT while identifying its limitations and future research directions.

What Is Red Light Therapy?

Red light therapy utilizes specific wavelengths of red and near-infrared light, typically in the 600–1000 nm range, to stimulate cellular activity without producing heat.

The biological mechanism behind RLT involves the absorption of light by mitochondria, particularly by cytochrome c oxidase, a key enzyme in cellular respiration. This absorption enhances adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, increasing cellular energy and promoting repair and regeneration.3

Additionally, red light stimulates the release of reactive oxygen species at controlled levels, triggering anti-inflammatory and antioxidant responses. It also improves blood flow by stimulating nitric oxide production, facilitating oxygen and nutrient delivery to damaged tissues.

These combined effects are believed to accelerate wound healing, reduce inflammation, enhance collagen production, and support muscle recovery, making RLT a promising therapy for a range of medical and cosmetic applications.3

These physiological responses have been explored for various medical and cosmetic applications, ranging from wound healing and pain relief to skin rejuvenation and sleep enhancement.4

Medical-grade red light therapy devices, such as high-powered light-emitting diode (LED) panels and laser-based systems, are used in clinical settings to treat wounds, reduce inflammation, and promote skin rejuvenation. These devices deliver precise wavelengths and higher intensities, ensuring deeper tissue penetration.5

In contrast, at-home consumer products, including consumer-grade LED panels, handheld devices, face masks, and light therapy beds, offer lower-intensity treatments designed for general wellness, anti-aging, and muscle recovery.6

Furthermore, while medical-grade devices are often Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and used under professional supervision, consumer versions provide convenience but frequently lack standardized dosing parameters and may require longer treatment times for noticeable results.5

5 Biohacking Secrets to Help You Live Longer

Skin Health, Sleep, and Recovery: Claimed Benefits

Skin Health

Red light therapy has been extensively studied in dermatology for its role in promoting collagen synthesis, accelerating wound healing, and reducing inflammation.

Clinical research suggests that RLT can improve skin elasticity, reduce fine lines, and aid in the management of inflammatory conditions such as acne and psoriasis.7 It is believed to stimulate fibroblast activity, enhance extracellular matrix production, and improve skin texture and tone.3

Additionally, RLT has shown efficacy in treating hyperpigmentation disorders, including melasma and vitiligo, by modulating melanocyte activity and reducing oxidative damage.4

However, while some studies confirm its benefits for skin rejuvenation, the variability in treatment protocols highlights the need for standardized guidelines in cosmetic dermatology.8

Sleep Improvement

Research on RLT’s effects on sleep quality suggests that exposure to specific wavelengths can influence circadian rhythms and melatonin secretion.

Photobiomodulation or light therapy, including the use of red wavelengths, has been investigated for its potential to enhance sleep onset, duration, and overall sleep efficiency. Some studies report that RLT exposure before bedtime may reduce sleep latency and improve deep sleep phases by modulating the body's natural light-response mechanisms.9

However, results remain mixed, with some trials showing minimal effects, likely due to differences in exposure timing and individual variability in light sensitivity.

The current evidence suggests that while the theoretical basis for RLT's role in sleep regulation is compelling, further large-scale studies are required to establish optimal application protocols.

Muscle Recovery and Performance

Sports medicine is a field where RLT has gained substantial attention for its potential to reduce muscle fatigue, enhance post-exercise recovery, and improve athletic performance.

Several clinical trials indicate that pre-exercise RLT may increase muscular endurance, reduce delayed-onset muscle soreness, and accelerate recovery through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.10

Photobiomodulation has also been linked to reduced levels of muscle damage markers such as creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting a protective effect against exercise-induced oxidative stress.6

However, while some studies support these findings, others report inconsistent results, emphasizing the need for standardized treatment parameters to optimize performance enhancement and recovery benefits.

The Link Between Cortisol, Inflammation, and Disease

Scientific Evidence and Clinical Studies

The scientific literature on RLT presents both promising and conflicting findings across different applications. For skin health, multiple studies confirm its efficacy in enhancing collagen production, improving wound healing, and reducing inflammation.7

Moreover, in clinical settings, RLT has demonstrated effectiveness in treating conditions such as acne vulgaris, rosacea, and eczema, with significant reductions in inflammatory cytokine levels.4

However, in the field of sleep quality improvement, although some controlled trials suggest that red light exposure may positively impact melatonin regulation and sleep quality, the evidence remains inconclusive.

Variations in study designs, exposure durations, and participant demographics are likely contributors to the inconsistency in reported outcomes.9

Nonetheless, systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the efficacy of RLT in sports therapy support the notion that RLT enhances muscle recovery and reduces oxidative stress.

However, discrepancies in study methodologies, including differences in light wavelengths, intensity, and application timing, pose challenges in establishing universal recommendations.10

Commercial Growth: Devices and Startups

The commercialization of RLT has surged in recent years, with a growing market for both professional-grade and consumer-friendly devices.

The early partnership between NASA and Quantum Devices resulted in the development of WARP (Warfighter Accelerated Recovery by Photobiomodulation), which was approved by the FDA to treat pain, muscle spasms, and inflammation in military personnel.1

More recently, companies such as NovoTHOR are developing red light therapy beds to treat chronic pain and improve circulation.11

Even well-known cosmetic brands such as Dior have paired up with companies that build lighting, such as Lucibel, to develop LED face masks to reverse skin aging.12

Limitations and Future Research

Despite its potential, RLT faces several limitations that warrant further investigation. One primary challenge is the lack of standardized treatment protocols, leading to inconsistencies in study outcomes.

Factors such as optimal wavelength selection, light intensity, and duration of exposure need to be refined to maximize therapeutic benefits.8

Additionally, long-term safety data on repeated RLT exposure remain limited, particularly regarding potential adverse effects on cellular function.

Moreover, while preliminary evidence supports RLT’s role in various health applications, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and establish clinical guidelines.

5 Simple Habits for Deeper, More Restful Sleep

Glowing Promises, Mixed Results

In summary, red light therapy represents a promising, non-invasive modality for improving skin health, sleep quality, and muscle recovery.

While existing scientific evidence supports several of its claims, inconsistencies in study findings highlight the need for standardized treatment protocols and further clinical validation.

As RLT continues to expand in both clinical and consumer markets, it is crucial to distinguish between medical-grade applications and unverified marketing claims.

Future research should focus on optimizing treatment parameters, assessing long-term safety, and exploring novel therapeutic applications of photobiomodulation.

The molecular mechanisms underlying RLT’s effects on different tissue types, as well as its potential applications in neurodegenerative conditions, immune modulation, and metabolic health, also warrant further investigation.

https://news-medical.net,Research provides a comprehensive genomic and epigenomic landscape of ICE syndrome,https://news-medical.net/news/20250328/Research-provides-a-comprehensive-genomic-and-epigenomic-landscape-of-ICE-syndrome.aspx,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome is a rare, irreversibly blinding ocular disorder with an unknown etiology. Lack of targeted effective drugs, inadequate disease prognosis, and high relapse rates post-surgery are the current challenges of ICE. Therefore, understanding its genomic and epigenomic landscape could aid in developing etiology-based therapies.

This research, published in the Genes & Diseases journal by a team from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou Medical University, Fujian Medical University, Shandong First Medical University, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Nanchang University, Nanjing Medical University, China Three Gorges University, Hebei Medical University, Central South University, Xiamen University, Zhejiang University, and the Macau University of Science and Technology, provides a comprehensive genomic and epigenomic landscape of ICE syndrome, with the potential to inform the development of etiology-based therapies.



The researchers recruited 99 ICE patients and performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on 51 and genome-wide DNA methylation profiling on 48. Mutational burden testing was conducted to compare the ICE cohort with control groups, revealing a significant association between the RP1L1 (retinitis pigmentosa 1-like 1) gene and ICE syndrome.



The researchers then investigated copy number variation (CNV) in ICE syndrome and identified 41 regions with significant CNVs, including three regions at chr19:15783859-15791329 (hg19), chr3:75786061-75790887 (hg19) and chr19: 55276166-55295820 (hg19), showing copy number loss in 39, 19 and 5 patients, respectively. Additionally, this study indicated that copy number loss of genes CYP4F12, ZNF717 and KIR2DL1 may induce dysfunction of corneal endothelial cells and viral infection-induced pathological conversion of corneal endothelial cells in ICE syndrome.



This study also identified 2,717 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), with hypomethylation prevalent in ICE syndrome (91.9% of DMRs). Among these, 45 recurrent hypomethylated regions (HMRs) in more than 10% of ICE patients showed differential methylation compared to normal controls. Interestingly, the researchers found that Chr2_95692705_95692728 (hg19), the most frequently identified HMR in ICE patients, lies on the promotor of gene MAL. This indicates that promoter hypomethylation and elevated expression of MAL may contribute to epithelioid hyperplasia of corneal endothelial cells in ICE syndrome.



The key findings of this study include the identification of pathogenic genes in patients with ICE syndrome that are related to ocular diseases, viral immunity, and epithelioid hyperplasia. These findings suggest that viral infections may trigger the pathological transformation of corneal endothelial cells based on these genetic and epigenetic susceptibilities, leading to the development of ICE syndrome. In conclusion, this study represents the first comprehensive genomic and epigenomic analysis of ICE syndrome using unbiased next-generation sequencing.",news-medical
