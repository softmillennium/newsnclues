Tim Winard knew he needed to buy health insurance when he left his management job in manufacturing to launch his own business.

It was the first time he had shopped around for coverage, searching for a plan that would cover him and his wife, who was also between jobs at the time.

"We were so nervous about not being on a company-provided plan," Winard said.

After speaking with an insurance agent, he decided against enrolling in an Affordable Care Act plan because he was concerned about the potential cost. Instead, he chose a short-term policy, good for six months.

Six months later, Winard was still working on starting his business, so he signed up for another short-term policy with a different insurer that cost about $500 a month.

When he needed a colonoscopy, Winard, 57, called his insurance company. He said a representative told him to go to any facility he wanted for the procedure.

Early last year, he had the colonoscopy at a hospital in Elmhurst, Illinois, not far from his home in Addison.

The procedure went well, and Winard went home right afterward.

Then the bill came.

Periodic colon cancer screening is recommended for people at average risk starting at age 45 and continuing until age 75, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. In addition to those for preventive purposes, doctors may order colonoscopies to diagnose existing concerns, as was the case for Winard.

There are several ways to screen, including noninvasive stool tests. A colonoscopy allows clinicians to examine and remove any polyps, which are then tested to see whether they are precancerous or malignant.

$10,723.19, including $1,436 for the anesthesia and $1,039 for the recovery room. After an insurance discount, his plan paid $817.47. Winard was left owing $7,226.71.

Short-term, limited-duration insurance policies do not have to follow rules established under the ACA because they are intended to be only temporary coverage.

As Winard experienced, benefits within the plans can vary, with some setting specific dollar caps on certain types of medical care — sometimes far below what it costs. What's covered can be hard to parse, and the insurer generally gets the last word on interpreting its rules.

While some short-term policies look like comprehensive major medical policies, all come with significant caveats. Most have limits that people accustomed to work-based or comprehensive ACA plans may find surprising.

All short-term insurance carriers, for example, screen applicants for health conditions and can reject them because of health problems or exclude those conditions. Many do not include drug coverage or maternity care.

The fact that short-term plans can cover fewer services, conditions, and patients is why they are generally less expensive than an unsubsidized ACA plan.

"The general trade-off is lower premiums versus what the plans actually cover," said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of the program on the ACA at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. "But the reason short-term plans are priced lower than a more comprehensive ACA plan is that they can deny people with preexisting conditions and don't have to cover a lot of essential health benefits."

Stunned that he owed more than $7,000 for his colonoscopy, Winard contacted his insurance company, Companion Life Insurance of Columbia, South Carolina.

An insurance representative told him in an email that it classified the procedure and all its costs, including the anesthesia, under his policy's "outpatient surgery facility" benefit.

That benefit, the email said, capped insurance payment "within that facility" to a maximum of $1,000 per day.

That definition surprised Winard, who said he read his policy to mean that there was a cap on what could be charged for the facility itself — not for all the care he received there.

"I interpreted it to be a facility like a recovery room or surgery room," he said. "They defined it to include any services at an outpatient facility."

His plan says it covers colon cancer screening at 80% after patients meet their deductible. It also covers 80% of the cost of drugs provided in an outpatient setting.

Winard, who had met his deductible, said he expected he would pay only 20% toward the cost of his colonoscopy. But he also wondered why the screening, performed at Endeavor Health Elmhurst Hospital, was categorized by the insurer as a procedure at an "outpatient" facility.

According to the email Winard received from his insurer, his policy's $1,000-a-day limit applies to "treatment or services in a state-approved freestanding ambulatory surgery center that is not part of a hospital, or a hospital outpatient surgery facility."

Elmhurst Health spokesperson Allie Burke said that the hospital has an attached building where same-day outpatient procedures like colonoscopies are performed.

Short-term plans have been sold for decades. But in recent years, they've become a political football.

Out of concern that people would choose them over more comprehensive ACA insurance, President Barack Obama's administration limited short-term plans' terms to three months. Those rules were lifted in President Donald Trump's first term, allowing the plans to again be sold as 364-day policies.

President Joe Biden, calling such plans "junk insurance," restricted the policies to four months — a change that took effect one month after Winard's procedure. Trump is expected to reverse Biden's reversal and again make them available for longer durations.

In December, Winard hired an advocate, Linda Michelson, to help him parse his bill. They wrote to the hospital, offering to pay $4,000 if it would settle the entire bill — an amount Michelson said is about four times what Medicare would pay for a colonoscopy. Winard said the hospital declined the offer.

Spencer Walrath, another Elmhurst spokesperson, wrote in an email to KFF Health News that the hospital's prices "reflect the value of the services we deliver."

Companion Life did not respond to requests for comment. Scott Wood, who identified himself as a program manager and co-founder of Pivot Health, which markets Companion Life and other insurance plans, said in an interview that there was room for interpretation in the billing and that he had asked Companion Life to take another look.

Shortly after Wood's comment to KFF Health News, Winard said he was contacted by his insurer. A representative told him that, upon reconsideration, the bill had been adjusted — although he was given no specific explanation as to why.

His new bill showed he owed only $770.

Short-term plans can be appealing for some people because of the relatively low cost of their premiums, but consumers should read all the plan documents carefully before enrolling. Understand that the plans often won't cover a full range of benefits, and check to see which services are covered and which are excluded. Check whether a policy includes per-day or per-policy-period dollar caps on coverage or other payout limits.

The federal government offers subsidies based on household income for ACA plans, which can make them comparable in cost to cheaper, short-term plans — but with a wider range of benefits.

In hindsight, Winard said he had not understood the difference between ACA policies and short-term plans.

His advice? Don't rely solely on marketing materials, and always get a cost estimate, preferably in writing, before a nonemergency procedure like a colonoscopy.

Mari Villar was slammed by a car that jumped the curb, breaking her legs and collapsing a lung. Amy Paulo was in pain from a femur surgery that wasn't healing properly. Katie Kriegshauser suffered organ failure during pregnancy, weakening her so much that she couldn't lift her baby daughter.

All went to physical therapy, but their health insurers stopped paying before any could walk without assistance. Paulo spent nearly $1,500 out of her own pocket for more sessions.

Millions of Americans rely on physical and occupational therapists to regain strength and motor skills after operations, diseases, and injuries. But recoveries are routinely stymied by a widespread constraint in health insurance policies: rigid caps on therapy sessions.

Insurers frequently limit such sessions to as few as 20 a year, a KFF Health News examination finds, even for people with severe damage such as spinal cord injuries and strokes, who may need months of treatment, multiple times a week. Patients can face a bind: Without therapy, they can't return to work, but without working, they can't afford the therapy.

Paulo said she pressed her insurer for more sessions, to no avail. "I said, 'I'm in pain. I need the services. Is there anything I can do?'" she recalled. "They said, no, they can't override the hard limit for the plan."

A typical physical therapy session for a privately insured patient to improve daily functioning costs $192 on average, according to the Health Care Cost Institute. Most run from a half hour to an hour.

Insurers say annual visit limits help keep down costs, and therefore premiums, and are intended to prevent therapists from continuing treatment when patients are no longer improving. They say most injuries can be addressed in a dozen or fewer sessions and that people and employers who bought insurance could have purchased policies with better therapy benefits if it was a priority.

Atul Patel, a physiatrist in Overland Park, Kansas, and the treasurer of the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, said insurers' desire to prevent gratuitous therapy is understandable but has "gone too far."

"Most patients get way less therapy than they would actually benefit from," he said.

Hard caps on rehab endure in part because of an omission in the Affordable Care Act. While that law required insurers to cover rehab and barred them from setting spending restrictions on a patient's medical care, it did not prohibit establishing a maximum number of therapy sessions a year.

More than 29,000 ACA health plans — nearly 4 in 5 — limit the annual number of physical therapy sessions, according to a KFF Health News analysis of plans sold last year to individuals and small businesses. Caps generally ranged from 20 to 60 visits; the most common was 20 a year.



Health plans provided by employers often have limits of 20 or 30 sessions as well, said Cori Uccello, senior health fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries.

"It's the gross reality in America right now," said Sam Porritt, chairman of the Falling Forward Foundation, a Kansas-based philanthropy that has paid for therapy for about 200 patients who exhausted their insurance over the past decade. "No one knows about this except people in the industry. You find out about it when tragedy hits."

Even in plans with no caps, patients are not guaranteed unlimited treatment. Therapists say insurers repeatedly require prior authorization, demanding a new request every two or three visits. Insurers frequently deny additional sessions if they believe there hasn't been improvement.

"We're seeing a lot of arbitrary denials just to see if you'll appeal," said Gwen Simons, a lawyer in Scarborough, Maine, who represents therapy practices. "That's the point where the therapist throws up their hands."

Katie Kriegshauser, a 37-year-old psychologist from Kansas City, Missouri, developed pregnancy complications that shut down her liver, pancreas, and kidneys in November 2023. After giving birth to her daughter, she spent more than three months in a hospital, undergoing multiple surgeries and losing more than 40 pounds so quickly that doctors suspected her nerves became damaged from compression. Her neurologist told her he doubted she would ever walk again.

Kriegshauser's UnitedHealthcare insurance plan allowed 30 visits at Ability KC, a rehabilitation clinic in Kansas City. She burned through them in six weeks in 2024 because she needed both physical therapy, to regain her mobility, and occupational therapy, for daily tasks such as getting dressed.

"At that point I was starting to use the walker from being completely in the wheelchair," Kriegshauser recalled. She said she wasn't strong enough to change her daughter's diaper. "I couldn't pick her up out of her crib or put her down to sleep," she said.

The Falling Forward Foundation paid for additional sessions that enabled her to walk independently and hold her daughter in her arms. "A huge amount of progress happened in that period after my insurance ran out," she said.

In an unsigned statement, UnitedHealthcare said it covered the services that were included in Kriegshauser's health plan. The company declined to permit an official to discuss its policies on the record because of security concerns.

Patients who need therapy near the start of a health plan's year are more likely to run out of visits. Mari Villar was 15 and had been walking with high school friends to get a bite to eat in May 2023 when a car leaped over a curb and smashed into her before the driver sped away.

The accident broke both her legs, lacerated her liver, damaged her colon, severed an artery in her right leg, and collapsed her lung. She has undergone 11 operations, including emergency exploratory surgery to stop internal bleeding, four angioplasties, and the installation of screws and plates to hold her leg bones together.

Villar spent nearly a month in Shirley Ryan AbilityLab's hospital in Chicago. She was discharged after her mother's insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, denied her physician's request for five more days, making her more reliant on outpatient therapy, according to records shared by her mother, Megan Bracamontes.

Villar began going to one of Shirley Ryan's outpatient clinics, but by the end of 2023, she had used up the 30 physical therapy and 30 occupational therapy visits the Blue Cross plan allowed. Because the plan ran from July to June, she had no sessions left for the first half of 2024.

"I couldn't do much," Villar said. "I made lots of progress there, but I was still on crutches."

Dave Van de Walle, a Blue Cross spokesperson, said in an email that the insurer does not comment on individual cases. Razia Hashmi, vice president for clinical affairs at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, said in a written statement that patients who have run out of sessions should "explore alternative treatment plans" including home exercises.

Villar received some extra sessions from the Falling Forward Foundation. While her plan year has reset, Villar is postponing most therapy sessions until after her next surgery so she will be less likely to run out again. Bracamontes said her daughter still can't feel or move her right foot and needs three more operations: one to relieve nerve pain, and two to try to restore mobility in her foot by lengthening her Achilles tendon and transferring a tendon in her left leg into her right.

"Therapy caps are very unfair because everyone's situation is different," Villar said. "I really depend on my sessions to get me to a new normalcy. And not having that and going through all these procedures is scary to think about."

Most people who use all their sessions either stop going or pay out-of-pocket for extra therapy.

Amy Paulo, a 34-year-old Massachusetts woman recovering from two operations on her left leg, maxed out the 40 visits covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts in 2024, so she spent $1,445 out-of-pocket for 17 therapy sessions.

Paulo needed physical therapy to recover from several surgeries to shorten her left leg to the length of her right leg — the difference a consequence of juvenile arthritis. Her recovery was prolonged, she said, because her femur didn't heal properly after one of the operations, in which surgeons cut out the middle of her femur and put a rod in its place.

"I went ballistic on Blue Cross many, many times," said Paulo, who works with developmentally delayed children."

Amy McHugh, a Blue Cross spokesperson, declined to discuss Paulo's case. In an email, she said most employers who hire Blue Cross to administer their health benefits choose plans with "our standard" 60-visit limit, which she said is more generous than most insurers offer, but some employers "choose to allow for more or fewer visits per year."

Paulo said she expects to restrict her therapy sessions to once a week instead of the recommended twice a week because she'll need more help after an upcoming operation on her leg.

"We had to plan to save my visits for this surgery, as ridiculous as it sounds," she said.

People with commercial insurance plans face more hurdles than those on Medicare, which sets dollar thresholds on therapy each year but allows therapists to continue providing services if they document medical necessity. This year the limits are $2,410 for physical and speech therapy and $2,410 for occupational therapy.

Private Medicare Advantage plans don't have visit or dollar caps, but they often require prior authorization every few visits. The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found last year that MA plans deny requests for physical and occupational therapy at hospitals and nursing homes at higher rates than they reject other medical services.

Therapists say many commercial plans require prior authorization and mete out approvals parsimoniously. Insurers often make therapists submit detailed notes, sometimes for each session, documenting patients' treatment plans, goals, and test results showing how well they perform each exercise.

"It's a battle of getting visits," said Jackee Ndwaru, an occupational therapist in Jacksonville, Florida. "If you can't show progress they're not going to approve."

Marjorie Haney's insurance plan covered 20 therapy sessions a year, but Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield approved only a few visits at a time for the rotator cuff she tore in a bike accident in Maine. After 13 visits in 2021, Anthem refused to approve more, writing that her medical records "do not show you made progress with specific daily tasks," according to the denial letter.

Haney, a physical therapist herself, said the decision made no sense because at that stage of her recovery, the therapy was focused on preventing her shoulder from freezing up and gradually expanding its range of motion.

"I went through those visits like they were water," Haney, now 57, said. "My range was getting better, but functionally I couldn't use my arm to lift things."

Haney appealed to Maine's insurance bureau for an independent review. In its report overturning Anthem's decision, the bureau's physician consultant, William Barreto, concluded that Haney had made "substantial improvement" — she no longer needed a shoulder sling and was able to return to work with restrictions. Barreto also noted that nothing in Anthem's policy required progress with specific daily tasks, which was the basis for Anthem's refusal.

"Given the member's substantial restriction in active range of motion and inability to begin strengthening exercises, there is remaining deficit that requires the skills and training of a qualified physical therapist," the report said.

Anthem said it requires repeated assessments before authorizing additional visits "to ensure the member is receiving the right care for the right period of time based on his or her care needs." In the statement provided by Stephanie DuBois, an Anthem spokesperson, the insurer said this process "also helps prevent members from using up all their covered treatment benefits too quickly, especially if they don't end up needing the maximum number of therapy visits."

In 2023, Maine passed a law banning prior authorization for the first 12 rehab visits, making it one of the few states to curb insurer limitations on physical therapy. The law doesn't protect residents with plans based in other states or plans from a Maine employer who self-insures.

Haney said after she won her appeal, she spaced out the sessions her plan permitted by going once weekly. "I got another month," she said, "and I stretched it out to six weeks."

New research uncovers how pairing intermittent fasting or low-calorie diets with high-intensity interval training can boost metabolism, burn fat, and enhance physical performance in postmenopausal women.

A recent study published in Nutrients determines how the combination of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with either intermittent fasting (IF) or a low-calorie diet (LCD) improves metabolic health among postmenopausal women.

Menopause leads to numerous physiological changes, some of which include increased visceral fat and reduced muscle mass. These changes, most of which can be attributed to reduced estrogen levels, can lead to systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and an increased risk of metabolic dysfunction.

Various strategies are recommended to postmenopausal women to manage these issues, including a combination of both nutritional and exercise interventions to support metabolic health. IF is a nutritional approach that involves alternating periods of eating with long fasting durations. The 16:8 diet, for example, recommends 16 hours of fasting and an eight- hour eating window during a 24-hour period.

IF also alters the levels of appetite-related hormones like orexin-A (OX-A), which is hypothalamic hormone that maintains energy balance and regulates eating behaviors. Fasting activates orexin neurons, thereby stimulating appetite-increasing hormones like neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP). Both NPY and AgRP exert sympathetic activity that leads to heat production and fat breakdown, which restores energy supplies to cells during fasting-induced stress.

Previous studies have reported that IF supports metabolic flexibility, during which cells throughout the body can transition between using glucose or fat as their primary source of energy. These responses promote the oxidation of fat, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce inflammation through various biological mechanisms, some of which include increased adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and autophagy, supporting mitochondrial function, and antioxidant effects.

HIIT synergistically improves these metabolic and appetite-related responses by causing acute metabolic stress, even as it enhances cardiorespiratory fitness. Many of the biological mechanisms implicated in the health benefits of HIIT are shared with IF, with higher OX-A levels associated with the combination of both HIIT and IF than either alone. OX-A stimulates brain reward pathways, which provides motivation for more physical activity while improving metabolic flexibility and promoting fat oxidation.

The current study included 30 postmenopausal women with an average age of 57.5 years who were exposed to either the LCD or IF along with HIIT for eight weeks. At baseline, the LCD group had better endurance and flexibility as compared to the IF group. Baseline exercise tolerance and aerobic capacity were higher in the IF group.

Both LCD and IF combined with HIIT improved metabolism, physical performance, and neurohormonal signaling in postmenopausal women. Whereas LCD relied on caloric restriction to reduce fat mass, IF improved metabolic switching and promoted fat burning.

The IF-HIIT group experienced significant improvements in their physical performance parameters, of which included flexibility and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2), at the end of the eight-week study period. Study participants in the IF-HIIT group also exhibited greater mean heart rates and endurance as compared to the LCD-HIIT group.

OX-A levels changed significantly over the intervention period, favoring the IF group. The baseline average OX-A level for the IF group exceeded that of the LCD group.

At eight weeks, OX-A evels tripled in the IF-HIIT group, with an over two-fold increase as compared to LCD-HIIT levels. Nevertheless, LCD was associated with reduced fat mass and improved insulin sensitivity.

The combination of IF and HIIT offers a dual-action strategy, enhancing metabolic flexibility while stimulating the orexinergic system to mitigate the metabolic decline associated with menopause.”

Both IF and LCD provide metabolic benefits, particularly when combined with HIIT in postmenopausal women, which may be due to alterations in the appetite-regulating system. These changes were induced by acute metabolic stress due to HIIT, as well as repeated switching between fat and carbohydrate utilization for energy due to IF.

The study findings suggest that the combination of both IF and HIIT is a promising approach to weight management and metabolic regulation in postmenopausal women. Nevertheless, future research is needed to elucidate how these metabolic and exercise-related shifts occur, as well as the long-term effects of IF and HIIT.
