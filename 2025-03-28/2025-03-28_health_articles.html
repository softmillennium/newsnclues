                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the first time, scientists have confirmed a neurobiochemical link between dopamine and cognitive flexibility.

Cognitive flexibility is the ability to adapt one's thinking and behavior appropriately to a changing environment and is considered an aspect of executive function. Cognitive flexibility differs among people and is reported to be impaired in several psychiatric and neurologic disorders, such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, addiction, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

At the neurotransmitter level, the dopamine system has been linked to cognitive flexibility. A direct neurochemical response to cognitive flexibility, however, has yet to be shown. In our study, we sought to examine the release of dopamine in real-time by performing PET scans while individuals completed behavioral flexibility tasks." Isabelle Miederer, PhD, associate professor in experimental nuclear medicine in the department of nuclear medicine at University Medical Center Mainz, Germany

Eighteen participants were scanned with the D 2/3 receptor ligand 18F-fallypride in a two-part block study design. In the first part, participants performed two tasks consecutively on a computer screen without rule switching while undergoing PET imaging. In the second part of the PET scan, participants had to switch flexibly between two task rules.

PET imaging analysis showed a displacement of 18F-fallypride in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during the task switching (higher cognitive demand) part of the study, which is assumed to be the release of dopamine. Results also showed that the greater dopamine release, the more efficient participants were in switching between tasks.

"The present findings emphasize the significance of dopamine in cognitive flexibility," said Mathias Schreckenberger, MD, head of the department of nuclear medicine at University Medical Center Mainz. "They are consistent with the results of previous clinical studies indicating that dopamine deficiency in disorders such as Parkinson's disease may cause behavioral deficits in cognitive flexibility."</p>

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects ten percent of the population and is the fourth most common cause of death in the world. The disease is mainly caused by smoke from biomass and the patient group is very heterogeneous in terms of symptoms and prognosis.



Researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have now shown that material from nasal lavage provides a basis for assessing COPD. Immune cells in the nose

The study included 50 research participants; active habitual smokers with and without COPD, as well as a control group of healthy non-smokers. Patients with other lung diseases were excluded from the study.



Among other things, the study participants underwent a simple nasal lavage so that the researchers could analyse the presence of IL-26 in the nose. The measured levels were found to reflect inflammation of the lower respiratory tract but also symptoms and other clinical findings in COPD.

A simple nasal lavage

The study also shows that T cells, a type of white blood cell in the immune system, are involved in the production of IL-26 in the nose.



Our results support that IL-26 contributes to the chronic inflammation that is typical for COPD. This may open up for new treatment strategies that target IL-26 to reduce inflammation and improve the quality of life for patients with COPD,"</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study published in the journal Immunity reveals a mechanism that allows triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) to develop resistance to therapy.

Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine showed that lipid accumulation in tumor cells and nearby immune cells promotes immune suppression, but disrupting lipid formulation reverses treatment resistance and the immunosuppressive microenvironment.


Standard-of-care treatment for TNBC includes chemotherapy and immunotherapy. However, some initially responsive tumors still develop recurrences. Researchers studied mouse models and found that TNBC cells that survived treatment accumulated lipid droplets containing Omega-6 fatty acids.

Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, near the tumor cells also accumulated these lipids.

"The tumor cells give the lipid droplets to surrounding neutrophils. This shifted the function of the neutrophils from antitumor to tumor promotion," said first author Dr. Liqun Yu.


"The prevailing perspective in our field has focused on the role of fatty acid metabolism in regulating the immune response and therapeutic response. We found in this study that not only can fatty acids serve as an energy source, but they also are precursors of immunosuppressive signals the cancer cells can use to fight against our immune system," said corresponding author Dr. Xiang H.-F. Zhang.


Researchers found they could reverse therapy resistance and the immunosuppressive microenvironment by disrupting lipid droplet formation. Blocking dietary intake of Omega-6 fatty acids also resensitized the tumors to chemotherapy and immunotherapy treatments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Long-term fasting in 24-hour cycles increases the sex drive of male mice by lowering the concentration of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain.

This effect is linked to a diet-induced deficiency of the precursor substance tryptophan – an amino acid that must be obtained through food.

Researchers from DZNE report on this in the journal Cell Metabolism, together with a Chinese team from Qingdao University and the University of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences.

They suggest that similar mechanisms may exist in humans and view fasting as a potential approach for treating unwanted loss of sexual desire.

Fasting is a recurring subject of research because reduced food intake and thus calorie restriction has a variety of effects on the organism beyond the commonly observed weight loss.

Dr. Dan Ehninger, research group leader at DZNE and lead author of the current study, and his team have also been working on this topic for quite some time.

"We are interested in the effects of fasting on aging. Using mice as a model, we investigate the underlying biological mechanisms," says the Bonn-based scientist.

Our aim is to gain insights that may also be relevant to humans," adds Ehninger.

The research results now published are based on a fortuitous discovery, as Ehninger and his colleagues had originally set out to investigate how fasting affects the offspring of male mice.

However, one particular finding steered their research in a new direction: aged male mice – senior individuals by human standards – that had fasted for extended periods produced an unusually large number of offspring.

Contrary to initial hypotheses, this phenomenon was not due to fasting effects on reproductive organs or the endocrine state of the animals.

Age-related changes in the testes, reduced sperm quality and lower testosterone levels, for example, argued against high fertility.

"It was a bit of detective work to uncover the real cause," says Ehninger.

"Eventually, we realized: it is a matter of behavior. The fasting males had significantly more sexual contacts than mice that could eat freely," explains Ehninger.

In other words, these animals had an unusually high frequency of mating and, as a result, an unusually high number of offspring for their age.

Their mating behavior more than compensated for the age-related physiological limitations," adds Ehninger.

Starting at two months of age, these male mice were subjected to a specific form of intermittent fasting.

Their access to food followed a recurring 24-hour pattern: the animals were allowed to feed ad libitum for 24 hours, followed by 24 hours with access to water only.

During the 22-month fasting regimen, the males were housed together without any contact with females.

They were later introduced to three-month-old females that had been raised without dietary restrictions.

Increased mating behavior was also observed in younger mice.

These males had also started intermittent fasting at the age of two months, but had followed this diet for only six months before being introduced to females.

They, too, were more sexually active than age-matched peers that had been fed ad libitum.

However, the effect was absent in other experimental groups – both young and old – that fasted for only a few weeks.

"For intermittent fasting to increase sex drive, it takes some time," says Zhou.

"The minimum duration appears to be somewhere between six weeks and six months," adds Ehninger.

In the course of investigating the causes, the researchers found that lower serotonin levels were associated with increased mating behavior in the mice.

This effect is linked to a diet-induced deficiency of the precursor substance tryptophan – an amino acid that must be obtained through food.

Chemical messengers also play an important role in regulating sexual behavior in humans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Accumulation of a protein called TDP-43 is a key feature of ALS and frontotemporal dementia.

In a newly published study, researchers report 'seeding' this accumulation through fragments of the culprit protein created in the lab.

TAR DNA-binding protein 43, better known as TDP-43, is a protein found in almost all human cells, where it plays essential roles in regulating gene expression, RNA processing, and cellular stress responses.

However, TDP-43 is infamous for its role in several neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS and frontotemporal dementia, but also Alzheimer's disease.

"TDP-43 pathology is considered a defining feature in nearly all ALS cases and about half of frontotemporal dementia cases," explains professor Sandrine Da Cruz, group leader at the VIB-KU Leuven Center for Brain & Disease Research.

In the brains of these patients, TDP-43 somehow mislocalizes, accumulates in the cytoplasm where it forms insoluble inclusions, and is depleted from the nucleus.

Building on recent reports that autopsied brain material from patients with TDP-43 inclusions can induce accumulation of insoluble TDP-43 in cells and transgenic mouse models, Da Cruz and her team sought a way to reproduce this so-called aggregation 'seeding' in the lab.

In a study recently published in Neuron, Da Cruz's team describes how they produced amyloid-like fibrils from a fragment of TDP-43 and that these fibrils trigger TDP-43 pathology in human cells, including iPSC-derived neurons.

The fibril-induced inclusions recapitulate many of the key hallmarks seen in patients, explains PhD student Jens Rummens: "The TDP-43 aggregates induced by the fibrils exhibited many of the modifications we also see in patient brains, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination."

Strikingly, the aggregates were able to recruit endogenous TDP-43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

The similarities extended to other downstream effects, as the team identified signature gene activity patterns that were previously linked to both aggregation and nuclear loss of TDP-43.

The aggregates themselves exhibited the same heterogeneity in morphology as typically seen in patients over time.

The new results strongly suggest that pathology in TDP-43 proteinopathies propagates in a self-templating and prion-like fashion, but many questions remain unanswered.

How is TDP-43 'trapped in the aggregates? What do they consist of and how do they trigger toxicity?

Da Cruz: "We have developed a valuable model that displays both aspects of TDP-43 pathology—cytoplasmic aggregation and nuclear depletion."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study found that more than half of US adults encounter some form of discrimination, which may fuel higher chances of depression and/or anxiety among specific racial and ethnic groups due to cultural, social, and systemic factors.

A growing body of research has drawn connections between everyday discrimination-the routine and often subtle forms of mistreatment that people experience on a day-to-day basis-and poor mental health. A new study by Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH) and Brown University suggests that higher exposure to discrimination increases a person's chances of developing depression and/or anxiety, and that this outcome varies by race and ethnicity.

Published in JAMA Network Open, the study found that over half of US adults experienced some form of discrimination, and individuals with high exposure to discrimination have more than five times the chances of screening positive for depression, and five times the chances of screening positive for anxiety. Compared to adults who do not experience discrimination, adults who do experience this mistreatment have nearly nine times the odds of screening positive for both depression and anxiety.

These observations were similar for men and women, but more pronounced among multiracial, White, and Asian adults, populations that are often overlooked in research and discussions about the effect of discrimination on health. The nationally representative findings provide valuable insight into the relationship between discrimination and mental health among multiple populations.

The researchers hope this data provides a deeper understanding of the mental health consequences of discrimination among a wider range of demographic groups, and encourages mental health screenings and support to mitigate these racial disparities.

Our study expands our understanding beyond typical Black-White comparisons, showing that everyday discrimination is a widespread issue that negatively impacts mental health across all racial and ethnic groups." Dr. Monica Wang, study lead and corresponding author, associate professor of community health sciences at BUSPH

For the study, Dr. Wang and study senior author Dr. Marie-Rachelle Narcisse, assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown, assessed 2023 national survey data to gauge experiences of discrimination, depression, and anxiety among nearly 30,000 adults ages 18 or older.

This sample population was weighted to represent more than 258 million US adults. To measure discrimination, the researchers utilized standardized scales that capture the frequency of mistreatment, such as receiving poor service or being harassed. They also utilized standardized scales to quantify experiences with depression (such as feeling down or hopeless, or having little interest in doing things) and anxiety (such as feeling nervous or experiencing an inability to stop worrying).

Nearly 56 percent of adults experienced a form of discrimination, and 3.6 percent of this group reported experiencing high levels of discrimination, most prevalent among Black adults, followed by multiracial or other adults, Hispanic or Latino adults, White adults, and Asian adults.

Discrimination was also more common among adults experiencing certain health disadvantages such as disabilities, obesity, and food insecurity, as well as immigrants and women. The researchers theorize that a combination of social, cultural, and systemic factors may be driving discrimination-related depression or anxiety among specific racial and ethnic groups.

Multiracial individuals may navigate unique experiences of mistreatment based on their multiple racial identities, while White individuals may experience mental health challenges that stem from mistreatment related to their income or educational levels. Asian adults may experience depression or anxiety stemming from language barriers or the "model minority" stereotype.

These perceived experiences carry real psychological weight, says Dr. Narcisse. Studies have shown that discrimination shapes mental health most deeply when left unacknowledged." I hope this study creates more awareness. As in awareness, there is strength and the ability to seek healing more intentionally."

Dr. Wang and Dr. Narcisse also caution that these findings do not suggest that discriminatory experiences and any related adverse mental health problems are less significant among Black, Hispanic, and Latino populations.

"Our results are a powerful reminder that discrimination is everyone's issue-and addressing it benefits society as a whole," Dr. Wang says.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome is a rare, irreversibly blinding ocular disorder with an unknown etiology.

Lack of targeted effective drugs, inadequate disease prognosis, and high relapse rates post-surgery are the current challenges of ICE.

This research, published in the Genes & Diseases journal by a team from various Chinese universities, provides a comprehensive genomic and epigenomic landscape of ICE syndrome.


The researchers recruited 99 ICE patients and performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on 51 and genome-wide DNA methylation profiling on 48. Mutational burden testing was conducted to compare the ICE cohort with control groups, revealing a significant association between the RP1L1 gene and ICE syndrome.

The researchers then investigated copy number variation (CNV) in ICE syndrome and identified 41 regions with significant CNVs, including three regions at chr19:15783859-15791329 (hg19), chr3:75786061-75790887 (hg19) and chr19: 55276166-55295820 (hg19).

Additionally, this study indicated that copy number loss of genes CYP4F12, ZNF717 and KIR2DL1 may induce dysfunction of corneal endothelial cells and viral infection-induced pathological conversion of corneal endothelial cells in ICE syndrome.

This study also identified 2,717 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), with hypomethylation prevalent in ICE syndrome (91.9% of DMRs). Among these, 45 recurrent hypomethylated regions (HMRs) in more than 10% of ICE patients showed differential methylation compared to normal controls.

The researchers found that Chr2_95692705_95692728 (hg19), the most frequently identified HMR in ICE patients, lies on the promotor of gene MAL. This indicates that promoter hypomethylation and elevated expression of MAL may contribute to epithelioid hyperplasia of corneal endothelial cells in ICE syndrome.

The key findings of this study include the identification of pathogenic genes in patients with ICE syndrome that are related to ocular diseases, viral immunity, and epithelioid hyperplasia.</p>
