The UK reserves the right to respond to American tariffs, Sir Keir Starmer has said.

The UK reserves the right to respond to American tariffs, Sir Keir Starmer has said, after US President Donald Trump’s decision to slap a 25 per cent import tax on cars.

The Prime Minister said his government was involved in ongoing discussions with the White House aimed at “mitigating the impact” of any levies but that ultimately “our national interest has to come first”.

The US is the second largest export market after the European Union (EU) for cars built in the UK.

Asked whether the UK reserves the right to respond to tariffs during a visit to Yorkshire, he said: “Yes, of course. Obviously, any tariffs are concerning and we’re working hard with the industries and sectors likely to be impacted.

“None of them want to see a trade war, which is why we’re engaged in discussions with the United States about mitigating the impact of tariffs.

“Now, that’s what we’re working hard on, but in answer to your question, yes – in the end, our national interest has to come first, which means all options are on the table.”

Carmakers meeting

Some 16.9 per cent of UK car exports were to the US last year, representing a total of more than 101,000 units worth £7.6bn.

Industry minister Sarah Jones held a virtual meeting with automotive industry leaders to discuss tariffs on Friday.

A government spokesperson said the minister listened to the attendees’ views on trade with the US, and they expressed their support for the government’s approach.

They added that the US is an “indispensable ally and one of our closest trading partners, with £1.2 trillion invested in each other’s economies”.

The import tax on cars is on top of a series of reciprocal tariffs set to come into effect on April 2, which could include a general 20 per cent levy on UK products in response to the VAT rate.

Sir Keir’s reluctance to hit back with the threat of reciprocal tariffs is driven by fears of the economic harm a trade war would cause.

‘Destructive trade war’

The budget watchdog warned a full-blown tariff war with the US could wipe one per cent off gross domestic product next year and derail Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ hopes of balancing the books, forcing her to implement more cuts or tax hikes.

That “worst-case scenario” would come about if Trump imposed 20 per cent tariffs on British goods and the UK reciprocated in kind.

It comes as shares in UK luxury carmaker Aston Martin dropped by six per cent when stock markets opened on Thursday morning. Jaguar Land Rover could be one of the UK vehicle manufacturers most affected by tariffs, with some 22 per cent of sales last year to the US.

Mike Hawes, chief executive of industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said the announcement of tariffs was “not surprising but, nevertheless, disappointing” and he urged both governments to strike a deal that avoids further damage.

Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman Daisy Cooper called for the UK to be ready to hit back, arguing: “Our car industry is being left at the mercy of Trump and his destructive trade war.”",cityam

NBA Europe is pushing ahead and will have a semi-open format and salary cap

It wasn’t quite the papal white smoke, but the NBA made the clearest statement yet this week that it intends to launch a new league in Europe.

In a joint appearance with the head of Fiba, basketball’s international governing body, NBA commissioner Adam Silver spoke of the “enthusiastic support” within both organisations to push ahead with the plans.

“The response we’ve gotten from the marketplace is very positive,” Silver said. “Whether it’s from media partners, fan research that we’ve done, discussions directly with Fiba, advertising agencies and other clubs in Europe, several of them who have also been enthusiastic about the potential opportunity to better serve basketball fans in Europe.”

Should it progress as planned, NBA Europe will feature 16 teams in a semi-open format, with 12 permanent members and four places available for qualifiers.

The teams are likely to be a mixture of existing European giants, such as Barcelona and Real Madrid, and new ones, some linked to football clubs such as Paris Saint-Germain and, reportedly, Manchester City.

New franchises will mean new investors, many of whom may have links to the NBA or the US more widely. So it was perhaps no surprise that Silver said that NBA Europe would operate a salary cap, in keeping with major sports in North America. These details, however, are by no means certain to be deemed compatible with EU law.

The aborted European Super League project initially planned a similar semi-open format but was forced to change that and comply with the European sports model of open competition.

Attempts to impose a hard salary cap in football have also failed while even plans for a soft cap face the threat of legal action from player unions.

“NBA Europe is an interesting concept. US owners and investors will look to make a profit so they will definitely want to ensure cost control measures are in place,” Darren Bailey, a sports regulation expert and consultant at Charles Russell Speechlys, tells City AM.

“Frankly, competition law is being deployed to attack all forms of regulatory frameworks at present so there may be a vulnerability, but a key issue is who are the likely complainants.

“Much depends on the structure and access of teams. If it looks like it will be a success and the process for admission is not meticulously fair, then excluded teams may look to challenge.

“In addition, players and agents may be encouraged to have a crack if they believe the market is being distorted and salaries/fees being unreasonably suppressed.”

Why European courts could give NBA leeway

NBA Europe could be given some extra latitude legally if viewed as a startup backed by big money, as some new sports leagues have when agreeing long broadcast deals, says Bailey, although the tendency for European judges to promote free markets in sport since the landmark Bosman ruling calls that into question.

Competition law has been successfully used to scupper Fifa’s planned cap on the fees taken by football agents and opened the door for new competitions, such as a European Super League, to be set up provided that they abide by certain key principles. But removing all protections for sport could end up damaging it, says Bailey.

“What will be fascinating is how they structure the inevitable collective bargaining agreement and player representation. My sense is they will adopt the US model and look to defend it if attacked based on various sporting and economic grounds such as uncertainty of outcome, wider talent distribution, fair allocation of revenue to players (circa 70 per cent) etc.

“Who knows, the Americanisation of regulatory frameworks may repel some of the arguments we have seen play out recently in the European courts.

“In my view if the courts don’t back off attacking sports regulations designed to protect key sporting imperatives, then national governments and the EU will need to grant exemptions from elements of competition law otherwise investors will disappear.”",cityam
https://cityam.com,What we can all learn from dogging,https://www.cityam.com/what-we-can-all-learn-from-dogging/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 11:53:58 GMT","What we can all learn from dogging

The best moment in a playwright’s life is when you see something and a play appears fully-formed in your head. That happened for me one warm night eight years ago, when I was walking home late after returning from seeing a play. I was living in Barnes, one of London’s poshest suburbs, and the word jumped out at me: “DOGGING”.

I wasn’t sure if the graffiti spray painted on the wall leading to the tennis court car park was random, intended as a protest or a provocation, or as genuinely useful advice. I wouldn’t dream of suggesting that the well-heeled and well-mannered denizens of Barnes engage in a bit of al fresco how’s your father but the sight of that word caused a whole play to manifest in my mind: upper middle class doggers. Frenetic sex against a car boot before breaking out the lapsang souchong for a quick tea break.

Everyone loves dogging, don’t they? When I tell people I’ve written a play about dogging, nearly everyone, regardless of whether they’re a friend or someone I’ve just met, responds the same way: giggling, then sharing their own dogging-adjacent anecdote. Funnily no one ever admits to going dogging, but everyone knows someone who does, or has a story of accidentally stumbling across a nest of doggers while taking a shortcut through a park a little too late in the evening.

Dogging is funny, and it’s funny because it’s non-threatening. I wanted to explore why that is. At a time when LGBTQ people’s rights are increasingly under attack (and when trans people are attacked and smeared by the libel that by simply existing in public are somehow acting out a sexual fetish), it’s weird that people who actually do have a fetish for exhibitionist sex are regarded as giggle-worthy. But dogging enjoys a benign reputation because it’s heterosexual-coded, and because it is regarded as so middle class and suburban. I was intrigued by the idea of subverting this by placing queer characters into an intensely heteronormative environment.

So I wrote a sweet and short play, a single scene: two young women meet while dogging and immediately fall in love, the piece ending with them agreeing to go on a first date to the cinema (how old fashioned!). The piece was performed at various short play festivals and received such riotous applause, I realised the potential for more. Then the government announced their proposed “porn ban”, an attempt to ban portrayals of certain sexual acts from porn. This ban seemed to target acts that show female pleasure or female domination (while counterpart sexual acts showing male domination were not named in the ban), and was perceived as an attack on female sexual liberation. This lead to the eye watering sight of porn stars, sex workers and feminist activists descending on the Houses of Parliament for a mass face sitting protest, at which rather incongruously Nick Clegg showed up to make a speech (in defence of facesitting!); he used the expression: “the government need to keep their noses out of other people’s private… lives.”

The full-length version of Puppy practically wrote itself, my pair of lovers deciding to start a feminist porn company together, which is then shut down by the porn ban, forcing them to become political activists and then struggle to balance their careers and activism with their romantic relationship. We debuted the play at Vault Festival, where it sold out. A West End transfer was mooted for summer 2020 but didn’t come to pass for some reason, and the play languished until the fine people at LGBTQ+ stage company Relish Theatre picked it up, and we’re now preparing for a four-week run at the King’s Head Theatre in London.

While my extensive research for this play was more along the lines of reading Foucault and Zizek (and listening to endless porn star and sex worker podcasts) than actually going dogging, dogging has still taught me a lot: that people should celebrate their bodies, and the people with whom they (consensually) share their bodies, without shame or fear. That sex and the emotions around sex are complicated and messy and that’s okay. And that we should never be afraid to talk about all of this, because it’s only by talking that we can understand each other. That is the function of theatre: to be a cultural empathy machine, a place where we can sit together in darkness to see people who are different from us or the same as us, and a place to encourage discussion. Puppy has certainly generated a lot of discussion in the rehearsal room, and I hope that’s what audiences take from seeing the play.",cityam

Employers remain pessimistic about hiring new staff as businesses ‘hoped for more’ from the Spring Statement, according to the REC.

Employers remain pessimistic about hiring new staff as businesses “hoped for more” from the Spring Statement, according to the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC).

Chancellor Rachel Reeves‘ Spring Statement saw multi-billion pound spending commitments on defence and construction as she vowed to “kickstart economic growth”.

But a new survey of more than 700 UK employers suggests that businesses remain downbeat about taking on new staff.

The survey was conducted before Reeves delivered her Spring Statement but a note from REC said: “Businesses hoped for more from this week’s Spring Statement to help them drive growth.”

The research showed a “very gentle trend of improvements” in business confidence but both measures taken – confidence in hiring and confidence in the UK economy – remained in the red.

Medium-sized and larger employers were more optimistic than small businesses as confidence among firms with up to 50 employees barely changed, the survey said.

REC’s last survey in January suggested that the rise in employers’ national insurance contributions had taken its toll on hiring intentions

Neil Carberry, REC’s chief executive, said that remained the case in their latest survey.

“We have seen business sentiment begin to improve this Spring, though the impact of the national insurance hike hangs over this like a fog,” he said.

The changes to employers’ national insurance contributions, which will come into effect from next week, will see firms pay an increase rate of 15 per cent of tax on earnings above a threshold of £5,000.

He urged Reeves to take action and introduce a raft of business-friendly policies to help the job market.

“Too often, the government talks a good game but day-to-day action paints business as the problem rather than the solution,” he said.

Carberry urged the Labour government to revise its flagship Employment flights Bill and make a “commitment to genuine partnership” that goes beyond setting up meetings.

“British business wants this government to succeed – but they need to support us to help them do it.”

Employers in London are negative about hiring in the short and medium term, representing low expectations among City firms for substantial economic growth this year.

“[Overall] optimism is tempered only a little by London, often a bellwether for the economy,” Carberry said.",cityam

(The Supreme Court. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images))

Lenders swim in shark-filled waters, with their fate in the hands of five Lord Justices as parties prepare for a showdown over motor finance on Tuesday.

Like any typical day, the Court of Appeal hands down its judgments, but on one particular Friday last October, one ruling turned a sector on its head.

Lady Justice Andrews, Lord Justice Birss and Lord Justice Edis heard three cases together, all appealing from regional English courts, but with one thing in common: motor finance commission.

Merchant banking group Close Brothers and South African Firstrand Bank are the targets in this case.

In each case, the car dealers made a profit on the sale of the car but also received a commission from the lender for introducing the business to them. The dealers were incentivised to fix the interest rate as high as possible within the permissible range to maximise the commission size.

These types of agreements have been banned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) since January 2021.

In one of the cases, the commission was kept secret from the claimants, while in the other two, the claimants were not told that the commission was to be paid.

The legal proceedings were issued against the banks, seeking, among other things, the return of the commission paid to the credit brokers.

After appearing at the County Courts, the cases went to the second highest court in England, which resoundingly sided with consumers.

‘David vs Goliath‘

The ruling caused a shockwave in an industry already preparing for a review by the FCA.

The City regulator was amidst a review of the historical motor finance commission arrangements and sales across several firms.

Lloyds, which owns the country’s biggest auto lender, Black Horse, made a £450m provision in February 2024, while a month later, Close Brothers, considered the most exposed bank in relative terms, outlined plans to bolster its finances by £400m in response to the probe.

But the court put a spanner in the works.

Over the last six months, Close Brothers’ share price has plunged nearly 24 per cent. While Lloyds Bank set aside an additional £700m in provisions, bring the total to £1.2bn. Meanwhile, Santander set aside £295m and Close Brothers reserves £165m.

There are now billions of pounds on the line after Moody’s quoted a potential compensation of £30bn.

The Headliner

Not surprisingly, the case is going to the Supreme Court.

The hearing is so vital that even HM Treasury tried to intervene, with the Chancellor concerned about the possible consequences of a ruling, but their bid to participate was rejected last month.

Despite the parties wanting a more extended hearing, the case will go in front of Lord Reed, Lord Hodge, Lord Lloyd-Jones, Lord Briggs and Lord Hamblen from next Tuesday until Thursday.

In addition to the main parties, the FCA and the National Franchised Dealers Association were granted permission to intervene in the hearing.

The Lord Justices will have five issues to consider, including:

Do car dealers owe consumers a ‘disinterested’ and/or fiduciary duty to provide information, advice or recommendation?

If so, were the payments of commission by the lenders to the car dealers secret, such that the lenders became primary wrongdoers?

If there was sufficient disclosure of the commission to negate secrecy, was there insufficient disclosure to procure the consumers’ fully informed consent to the payment such that the lenders are liable?

Can the lenders be liable in the tort of bribery?

Can insufficient disclosure also suffice to make the relationship between lender and consumer ‘unfair’ under the Consumer Credit Act?

Once a ruling is published, the FCA said it would publish its decision within six weeks of whether it proposes a redress scheme.

There is also a separate matter on the same topic in the courts after Barclays lost a legal challenge against the Financial Ombudsman Service over a ruling that said it unfairly paid car commission.",cityam

UK growth was confirmed to have grown at a sluggish pace of 0.1 per cent in the final quarter of 2024.

The UK economy barely grew in the final quarter of 2024 as estimates remained unchanged, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has vowed to deliver growth “further and faster”.

But Reeves has faced a rocky start as GDP only grew by 0.1 per cent between October and December.

Previous estimates said growth would come in at 0.1 per cent for last year’s final quarter.

The small expansion at the end of 2024 followed zero growth in the third quarter.

In annual terms, the final figure was slightly better than previously expected as UK growth hit 1.1 per cent.

Previous estimates said the UK economy grew by 0.9 per cent in 2024.

Read more Reeves eyeing spending cuts as fiscal walls cave in

The revisions made to the earlier parts of the year suggested the UK economy was more resilient than previously thought.

“Today’s updated GDP estimates indicate that the economy grew slightly more strongly in the first half of last year than previously estimated but continues to show little growth since last summer,” Grant Fitzner, the ONS’ chief economist, said.

Business investment grew by 1.8 per cent year-on-year, far higher than predictions which said there would be a decline of 0.7 per cent.

But figures also showed a fall of 1.9 per cent in the final quarter.

The UK’s trade account’s deficit also widened by £0.5bn in the last quarter as imports surged rose more than exports.

“Today’s deluge of data confirmed that the economy was weak even before the full effects of higher business taxes are felt and that a high household saving rate continues to restrain GDP growth,” Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said.",cityam

VAT: There is one tax that has turned a biscuit into a legal battle and a marshmallow into a courtroom mystery, while, at the same time, has caused a lot of confusion for businesses.

There is one tax that has turned a biscuit into a legal battle and a marshmallow into a courtroom mystery, while, at the same time, has caused a lot of confusion for businesses.

Value Added Tax (VAT) – a levy that has only been around 53 years – still finds itself the centre of attention at the HQ of HMRC.

Introduced in the Finance Act 1972, VAT is considered one of the UK’s most important taxes, accounting for 20 per cent of central government revenue in 2022.

Current VAT rates are 20 per cent standard and zero-rated for others.

What makes it confusing, especially for food businesses, is the exempt list, which is zero-rated.

Food and drink for human consumption is usually zero-rated but some items are always standard-rated, which includes confectionery, hot food and savoury snacks.

Occasionally, some businesses try their luck with the rule. For other businesses, the rules can be confusing to follow.

Either way, HMRC rolls up its sleeves to get litigious. Like other government departments, HMRC has an in-house legal team. While its legal budget isn’t publicly disclosed, in 2023-24, the tax agency spent £4.3bn to collect £829bn in tax.

But from these legal battles, we get something we never thought was possible: tax can be funny.

The most famous case was in 1991 when McVitie’s had everyone wondering if its famous orange-flavoured chocolate sponge was ‘a biscuit or a cake’?

Well, a Tax Tribunal legally classified Jaffa Cake as a cake due to its sponge-like texture and how it changes when stale. As a result, it is subject to zero-rate VAT.

The mouth-sized ‘cakes’ went on to start a trend of fun – for the public, not the businesses – tax cases.

Dissecting a potato

Once you pop, the fun doesn’t stop. Unfortunately for Pringles owners, the fun stopped in 2009 when the stacking snack was deemed liable for VAT.

Read more Eat marshmallows with your hands? HMRC wants you to pay more tax

The flavoured snack was deemed a “potato crisp” as 42 per cent of the product was made up of potato.

Most big-brand snack-based foods have found themselves in the same situation, and with how over the place the rules are set, you don’t blame the businesses for being confused.

Are you a big fan of Monster Munch or Wotsits? They are taxed at standard-rated, while Skips and Twiglets are zero-rated.

Poppadoms are zero-rated, but Walkers’ Sensations Poppadoms are liable for VAT after a Tribunal ruled last year they are similar to potato crisps.

Just last week, a case regarding the VAT liability of giant marshmallows took “a new bizarre twist.”

The Court of Appeal sent the case back to the First Tier Tribunal following questions on how people eat large marshmallows.

As Robin Prince, VAT partner at accountancy firm MHA, explained: “A significant amount of tax is now going to rest on whether the Tribunal think that a giant marshmallow is normally eaten with the fingers or off a skewer.”

Other notable mentions include Innocent Drinks losing a legal battle in 2010, making liable for the tax. Teas including herbal teas are zero-rated, but not Iced Teas, those need to pay VAT.

Caviar is also VAT-free.

Prince told City AM that the long list of VAT cases “highlighted the complete absurdity of the VAT laws in relation to food”.

“The general public might question whether HMRC continuing to fight these legal actions is really the best use of taxpayers’ money when we all know that making any sense of the VAT dividing lines on food has defeated the best legal minds for decades,” he explained.

Prince went on to call on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to completely overhaul how the zero-rating for food works “to provide certainty and a level playing field for all food producers.”",cityam

Steel billionaire Lakshmi Mittal is set to leave the UK, as a direct result of a government crackdown on non-domiciled residents, in favour of more tax-friendly destinations such as the United Arab Emirates, Italy and Switzerland, the FT has reported.

The businessman, a former Blair-era Labour donor and Sunday Times Rich List number seven, is set to leave the UK after nearly 30 years.

The Indian entrepreneur owns a number of properties in the UK, including a mansion in Kensington Palace Gardens which he bought from Bernie Eccleston in 2004 for £67m – then the world’s most expensive home.

Mittal was chief executive of ArcelorMittal until four years ago, when he stepped down in favour of his son Aditya Mittal.

He remains executive chair of the group – a 2006 merger of Mittal Steel and European steel giant Arcelor – and his family retain a 40 per cent stake in the firm.

ArcelorMittal’s business lines span from steel production to wire products, logistics and shipping.

Ahead of the October Budget, the firm threatened to leave the UK, warning the new government’s industrial strategy must do more to protect the steel industry’s supply chain.

Non-doms were previously able to avoid paying UK taxes on income from overseas.

Rule changes were first introduced by former Chancellor Jeremy Hunt back at the March 2024 Budget – in part, as a political manoeuvre to outflank an existing Labour policy commitment – and will take effect on 6 April.

Rachel Reeves has since recommitted to the plans, and has pulled the plug on offshore trusts as a workaround for inheritance tax.

Rachel Reeves has since made some concessions back in January in an attempt to stem the exodus of the super rich from the UK, introducing a new residence-based scheme to offer some tax incentives for international investors.

Reeves has lost half of her £9.9bn headroom according to one calculation.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has had £5bn wiped off her headroom less than 48 hours after she delivered her Spring Statement, a calculation by Bloomberg Economics has suggested.

Chancellor Reeves has received several warnings from leading economists at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) and the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) that her headroom risks getting obliterated by the autumn.

But Bloomberg Economics’ calculations suggest Reeves has already lost half of her fiscal headroom.

Since the end of the Spring Statement, government borrowing costs have risen with the benchmark 10-year yield rising by as much as eight basis points to 4.81 per cent on Thursday —its highest level since mid-January when a global bond selloff severely impacted Chancellor Rachel Reeves’s fiscal flexibility.

Helen Thomas, founder of Blonde Money, noted that under the OBR’s projections, the headroom would be wiped out if gilt yields were to rise by just 0.6 percentage points. Since the forecast was compiled, yields have risen 0.4 percentage points.

Autumn statement warning

Analysts at the financial services provider said that moves in financial markets on Thursday shed more than half of her £9.9bn of headroom.

“That half the headroom has already been wiped out shows that there’s an awful lot more work to do to shore up the public finances,” said Dan Hanson, chief UK economist at Bloomberg Economics.

“The autumn is shaping up to be another big policy event for the chancellor.”

Bloomberg Economics based its calculation on prices set by financial markets at the end of Thursday’s trading.

The calculation confirms leading economists’ fears as uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s “retaliatory” tariffs and energy prices risks creating a bigger fiscal hole.

Read more Reeves doubles down on fiscal rules amidst waning headroom

Reeves’ headroom was the third-smallest on record, with former Chancellor Jeremy Hunt leaving himself some £30bn of headroom after his Spring and Autumn Budgets.

Many City firms are already preparing for the worst. Economists at Jefferies and Investec have already said further tax rises are coming in Autumn.

Tax band freeze

Speaking at a post-Spring Statement event on Thursday morning, IFS director Paul Johnson warned that the Chancellor may have to extend freezes to income tax and national insurance thresholds beyond 2030.

“There is a good chance that economic and fiscal forecasts will deteriorate significantly between now and an Autumn Budget,” he said.

“If so, she will need to come back for more; which will likely mean raising taxes even further.”

He also said investors should be aware of a possible wealth tax and that speculation could damage Reeves in coming months.

“With no sense of a tax strategy, we have no idea which way the Chancellor might turn,” he said.

Reeves said she was in “intensive discussions” with the Trump administration in a bid to avert the hit of his tariffs.

Her comments came after Trump said he was putting a 25 per cent tariff on all auto imports, jeopardising around £6.4bn worth of trade between the UK and US.",cityam

AJ Bell was selected as the best all rounder for Stocks and Shares ISAs, while Trading 212 was the cheapest.

AJ Bell, Interactive Investor and Trading 212 have been selected as the best Stocks and Shares ISA providers on the market, due to their wide range of investment options and low platform fees.

According to Kepler Trust Intelligence, AJ Bell is the best ‘all-rounder’ ISA provider, even though competitor Trading 212 took the label of the cheapest provider.

Interactive Investor came second in the ranking of the cheapest providers*.

Aberdeen’s interactive investor also topped a ranking of the Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP)* providers in the UK. The platform is currently offering up to £3,000 in cashback to investors who switch platforms before the end of the tax year on 5 April*.

Cheapest Stocks and Shares ISA providers

Trading 212 charges no trading or platform fees and pays one of the highest interest rates on uninvested cash.

The ISA can be managed online or through the Trading 212 app. Investors can choose between exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or shares.

The only fee paid on a Trading 212 Invest & ISA comes when making trades in an overseas currency.

However, Kepler described it as a “no-frills option” due to its limited research and online chat-only support.

“Overall, Trading 212 is likely to appeal to frequent traders or investors looking for a basic, low-cost provider,” Jo Groves, investment specialist at Kepler Partners, said.

Meanwhile, AJ Bell charges a 0.25 per cent platform fee on the first £250,000, 0.1 per cent on the next £250,000, and no fee over £500,000.

There is a separate platform fee of 0.25 per cent for share-based investments (including investment trusts and ETFs) which is capped at £3.50 per month.

For trading fees, it charges £5 for UK and international shares but only £1.50 for trading in funds. Reduced traders receive a reduced fee of £3.50 on shares if they trade 10 or more times in the previous month.

If you want the most investment options for your ISA, it’s best to look at the largest stockbrokers – AJ Bell, Hargreaves Lansdown and Interactive Investor.

AJ Bell offers more than 15,000 shares, 4,000 funds, 3,500 ETFs, and more than 400 investment trusts and covers 24 markets worldwide.

Hargreaves Lansdown has more than 8,500 shares, 4,000 funds, 1,400 ETFs and 400 investment trusts.

The power of art, symbolised by a Rotterdam metro saved by a whale’s tail (Kim Naomi/Wikimedia Commons)

Art can save lives, sometimes literally (see above), TfL’s art scheme is more than worth celebrating, writes James Reed, chairman and CEO of Reed

TfL celebrates the power of art

In 2020, a train in Rotterdam dramatically overran the stop blocks at a station on an elevated metro line.

A carriage, at risk of plunging into the water in a viaduct below, was saved by a 30ft high art sculpture of a whale’s tail, designed by architect Maarten Struijs, which elegantly prevented its fall. Only the driver was on board when this happened, and he was able to free himself without injury. Images of this implausible incident were shared widely in the media, with some news outlets using the headline ‘Saved by a Whale’s Tail’.

It became a compelling visual metaphor for the power of art to save lives. It is also the impetus for a new project my company Reed is proud to be involved in that seeks to uncover more such stories at a time when the arts are radically underfunded and undervalued.

Working with Transport for London (TfL), we are sponsoring Art on the Underground, which has been bringing leading international artists to London’s transport network for 25 years.

Travelling is about more than just getting from A to B. A journey can provide a moment in someone’s day for joy or contemplation, and great art can play a real part in that.

One new large-scale commission by artist Ahmet Öğüt, in collaboration with New Contemporaries, an organisation that supports emerging and early career artists, is inspired by that incident in Rotterdam. It is called ‘Saved by the Whale’s Tail, Saved by Art’, and asks what role art can have in society.

The artist is calling for public stories that champion, interrogate and celebrate how art has saved lives, literally and figuratively. Posters displayed across the entire London Underground network from next week will ask the public to submit their stories of how art has saved them to the website of New Contemporaries.

Submissions will be reviewed by a judging panel, including the artist, and the winning entry judged the most compelling and original will have their story displayed alongside a new commission by Öğüt at Stratford Underground station this autumn. In addition, they will receive an artwork, a bronze sculpture created by Öğüt.

There is nowhere like London’s vast transport network to ask for these stories, reaching millions of Londoners and visitors. I hope City AM readers will get involved and share their insights of how art has changed their lives. Submit your story here: https://newcontemporaries.org.uk/current/save-by-art

My attempt to restore the Forest of Bradon

I am thrilled by plans to create a new national forest stretching from the Cotswolds to the Mendips. The Western Forest will see 20m trees planted across the West of England in the coming decades, creating at least 2,500 hectares of new woodland.

We have been planting over 100,000 trees on my own and Reed company land in Wiltshire for several years, in an attempt to restore the Forest of Bradon which was cut down by Henry VIII to make ships. Oak and silver birch have done particularly well because the ground is clay. The forester we work with, Keith Mills, has personally planted 2m trees and tells me if we’d planted enough in the 1980s we could be delivering net zero by now.

The minefield of ‘business casual’

I was recently asked by GQ magazine what sort of attire is acceptable for a ‘business casual’ dresscode. The distinction between business casual and business professional traditionally lies in whether or not a jacket is worn. Business casual suggests that no jacket is needed; a shirt with a collar and a jumper is acceptable. Conversely, business professional implies that a jacket should be worn.

In the old days, people dressing business casual used to wear a suit and a jacket with an open collared shirt, or chinos and a jacket. But now it’s much more varied, and interpreted differently by different generations. Someone in their twenties or thirties may feel quite smart in expensive trainers, for example, while older people might frown on that sort of footwear in the office. It’s a minefield!

Spring has sprung

I have enjoyed getting my Vespa out in the spring weather. I can smell the grass in Hyde Park and the cooking of street food in Soho, and I love soaking up the energy of the young people in the pub on the way home after work on a Thursday. The city feels as if it’s coming to life and it’s very good for the spirit.

A recommendation…

I’m glued to The White Lotus and think Mike White is a genius. Parker Posey as a lorazepam-fuelled Southern grand dame is TV gold. For anyone that’s ever stayed in a luxury resort, the social satire of the appalling behaviour of over-privileged guests is a little too close to the mark.",cityam

London cannot compensate for UK-wide challenges facing entrepreneurs, writes Opinium head of policy James Crouch

London has long been recognised as a global centre for business and innovation. Despite the capital’s many advantages, however, the UK has not ranked among the top 20 global markets for entrepreneurs since 2019. So why is the UK struggling to maintain its reputation as a leading hub for startups and business growth?

The recently released Opinium Global Entrepreneurship Index gives us a clue. The index evaluates 137 countries across five ‘pillars’ that determine the attractiveness of a country for entrepreneurship. Since 2011, the index has highlighted both strengths and weaknesses in the UK’s business landscape. Unfortunately, despite London’s key advantages, systemic challenges continue to hold the UK back, preventing it from reclaiming a spot among the world’s best markets for entrepreneurs.

The UK’s lagging digital infrastructure

One of London’s long-standing strengths has been its strategic location and global connectivity. Situated in a central time zone, the city has historically served as a crucial hub for international business and trade. However, in today’s increasingly digital world, this geographical advantage is proving less significant.

According to Opinium’s Index, the UK was once a top 10 market for connectivity, but over the last 15 years, it has fallen nine places in our rankings related to digital infrastructure. This decline highlights two key challenges.

The first challenge is absolute in nature. The UK faces connectivity and infrastructure issues, particularly beyond London. While the capital boasts high-speed internet and excellent digital access, the country as a whole lags behind. This is becoming an increasing liability in a world where digital accessibility is a critical success.

The second challenge is more relative. Other markets are rapidly advancing in areas where the UK was once dominant. Many countries, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, are making significant investments in digital infrastructure. This shift is evident in the Index’s rankings, where the United Arab Emirates now leads globally in connectivity, and seven of the top ten markets in this category are located in the Middle or Far East. If the UK hopes to re-establish itself as a leading market for entrepreneurship, it must invest in nationwide digital infrastructure improvements.

How London business got so far ahead

Despite the challenges, London remains a powerhouse in one key area: human capital. The city is home to a diverse, highly skilled and dynamic workforce, making it an attractive destination for entrepreneurs seeking top-tier talent to scale their businesses.

Opinium’s Index shows that human capital is the only area where the UK has improved over the past 15 years. This growth is largely attributed to London’s ability to attract and retain world-class professionals. Entrepreneurs benefit from access to a deep talent pool, ensuring they can find the skills needed to build and expand.

London’s cosmopolitan nature naturally fosters innovation. The UK’s universities and research institutions continue to produce skilled graduates that flock to London, and its openness to international talent has been a key driver of business success. However, while this strength is valuable, it has not been enough to balance out the wider national trend.

More widely the gap between the Western and Eastern hemisphere in entrepreneurship is narrowing, and in many cases, the East has taken the lead. Countries in Asia and the Middle East have aggressively implemented policies that attract businesses, improve connectivity and foster innovation. The UK, along with other European markets, must take a hard look at these developments and identify areas where it can improve.

Whilst London remains a strong asset for the UK, it cannot single-handedly compensate for national shortcomings. Policymakers must prioritise investments in infrastructure, digital transformation and regulatory frameworks that encourage entrepreneurship. If London and the broader UK economy are to reclaim their positions as leading global startup hubs, they must adapt to the realities of an evolving business landscape.

Alcohol could be slapped with a sin tax

Pitiful growth forecasts will tempt Reeves to impose sin taxes on everything from a can of coke to a holiday, says James Price

I’ve previously called the Chancellor Reeves the Roundhead in these pages, in honour of her fun-killing ways. But she’s not the first Chancellor to tax having a good time.

A tax designed to disincentivise behaviour, or at least recoup the perceived costs of that behaviour, is known as a Pigouvian tax, and they are used today on everything from cigarettes, alcohol and sugar to fuel duties and even the blasted payment for plastic bags in shops.

There come points where these sorts of taxes become self-defeating, as all taxes do. In Britain today, this is increasingly true of various ‘sin’ taxes – or fun taxes, as I’d rather we called them.

The most heavily taxed are the original target of sin taxes – tobacco. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has said that the evidence shows that the duty rate for cigarettes is already beyond the peak of the ‘Laffer curve’, the revenue maximising rate of tax. At least 80 per cent of what you would assume you could yield from a ‘static’ raise is lost to behavioural changes. You might think that this is tax, ostensibly to encourage smokers to quit, is just doing its job? But while legal tobacco sales have halved in recent years, the number of smokers has only dropped by 0.5 per cent.

What is happening is that the high costs have forced smokers to switch to illegal or counterfeit cigarettes. These are full of God knows what horrors and the revenues from these fags are going into the hands of criminals. The government’s excessive taxation is literally helping fuel crime, rather than raising revenues.

With this trend set to continue, the government will have to find other ways to fill its coffers. Ordinarily the easiest way to do this would be to try to stimulate economic growth. But on Wednesday the OBR revealed this will remain below a pitiful two per cent for the rest of the parliament.

A slippery slope

Yet instead of admitting they got it wrong with their jobs tax, Labour will look to raise money in other ways, and the slope will get slipperier. To someone wielding the sin tax hammer, everything starts to look like a sin. To this end, smokers are likely to be merely the canary in the coal mine, and whatever your vice of choice is, you should prepare for it to get whacked. Soon we could see moonshine follow fags as coming from illicit sources. Then there will be contraband chocolate bars as the sugar tax is increased, presumably along with an admonition that eating a Kitkat is bad for ‘our NHS’.

And meat has long been discussed as the next frontier – Ed Miliband will be wheeled out to say that cow farts are killing the earth, and before you know it his greatest enemy – the bacon sandwich – will have a huge tax slapped on it. Fancy a bootleg of lamb, anyone?

Ed Miliband will be wheeled out to say that cow farts are killing the earth, and before you know it his greatest enemy – the bacon sandwich – will have a huge tax slapped on it

I’m only being partly facetious here. Despite being presented with the evidence that excessive taxes are fuelling crime and lowering revenues, too many politicians are unable to break away from mind-forged manacles and pursue a different path.

Now ask yourself, if sugar, booze and meat are subject to a punitive tax hike, what could be next? And what could this mean for taxes, on insurance, on flights or on banks?

You may not care about cigarettes, or a pint of lager, or a can of coke. But if Labour doesn’t stub out this tax obsession, all our dreams could go up in smoke.

It added to their existing partnership with School of Hard Knocks as well as their title sponsorship deal with EPCR for the Champions Cup, which returns this weekend with the round of 16.

Torran Macdougall, Programmes Director at School of Hard Knocks said: “This is the second time our young people have had the opportunity to compete in rugby fixtures, and it’s wonderful to see how their confidence has grown.

“The courage it takes to step onto the pitch and take part in a full-contact rugby tournament is truly brilliant to witness.

“This experience allows them to see their hard work pay off while demonstrating the core values of rugby in action.”

Investec helping SOHK

SOHK currently works with over 1,000 pupils across 29 schools in England, Scotland, and Wales. It has plans to grow its reach in the next 5 years so it can double its support to young people by 2030.

The charity uses education and sport to aid participants’ confidence, communication, control, commitment and cohesion.

Investec this month said it expects adjusted operating profit to be ahead of last year’s figures, potentially nearing £1bn.

The financial services provider said its adjustment now forecasts operating profit between £888m and £956m.

City AM understands that the famous Investec zebra featured at Eton Manor at the weekend, while those competing in the tournaments – up to 300 young people – showed off their skills and learnings from being part of School of Hard Knocks while enjoying a top rugby extravaganza.

The government has revealed amendments to the football regulator’s powers under the Football Governance Bill

The powers to be afforded to the independent football regulator have been clarified after the government published its list of amendments to the Football Governance Bill.

Calls for a sunset clause from some Tory peers have been rejected, although the Secretary of State will be required to formally review how well the act is working after five years of the football regulator.

It has been made clear, meanwhile, that the contentious backstop powers which would allow the watchdog to impose a financial distribution agreement on the Premier League must only be used as a last resort.

And in another small win for opponents of the plans, the football regulator will now be required to consider the financial growth of English football among its objectives.

On the whole, the amendments published this week at the Lords Report stage offer some concessions to those who have argued that the regulator will kill the golden goose, the global success of the Premier League, without providing a silver bullet to kill it off completely.

The bill is still to pass through the Commons but is expected to do so quickly due to Labour’s strong majority and could be enacted into legislation as soon as this summer.

Adding “the financial growth of English football” as a secondary duty of the football regulator is designed to ensure that any measures taken to safeguard clubs do not have the oft-cited unintended consequences of inhibiting top clubs’ on-field and off-field prosperity. Players and fans have been added to the list of stakeholders with whom the football regulator will be required to “proactively and constructively engage”. This could see footballers’ union the PFA and supporters’ groups consulted. The bill “has been amended to add a requirement for the Secretary of State to carry out a review of the operation of the act, and its impact on the industry, no later than five years from the full commencement of the licensing regime”. This is “not a sunset clause, it is an accountability clause”, says Niall Couper of Fair Game. The football regulator’s backstop powers have been tweaked to make clear that “it is a mechanism of last resort and that the IFR should consider if the questions that need to be resolved could be resolved through its other functions before triggering the process”. In addition, the backstop won’t be triggered before 2027, as the football regulator must first complete a State of the Game report 18 months into its operation. A register of interests, similar to that used in parliament, will be created to which all football regulator board members and experts it regularly consults must declare. This is designed to prevent conflicts of interest and bring greater transparency to the process.

Expert reaction to the amendments

Niall Couper, CEO of governance reform campaigners Fair Game:

“The changes to the Bill are tweaks around the edges. Ensuring a regulator is scrutinised by Parliament on a regular basis is common practice and will mean that it stays true to its key objective – to ensure financial sustainability of the English football pyramid.

“What is important is that the Regulator does have the power to address the main concerns of the game – namely financial flow. Without those powers, then what is the point of a Regulator? It is about right touch, not light touch.”

Joachim Piotrowski, a senior associate at Osborne Clarke:

“Overall, the amendments to the Football Governance Bill published today are a positive step towards improving football governance in the UK. However, the success of these amendments will depend on their effective implementation and the regulator’s ability to operate independently and fairly.

“With regard to point 3 (statutory review), my reading of it is that this is not entirely equivalent to a sunset clause due to the fact that no hard stop date has been introduced in the Bill – rather only a provision stating that a review will occur at some point in the future (after which the Secretary of State might make no changes to the regulator’s operations).

“Introduction of the statutory assessment can be seen as the government acknowledging that regulations may need to be adjusted based on their real-world impact. This provides an opportunity to identify any shortcomings or areas for improvement, ensuring that the regulatory framework evolves to meet the needs of the industry.

“On the positive side is the fact that the review will be based on empirical evidence gathered over the five-year period, allowing for informed decision-making. This approach will hopefully ensure that changes to the regulation are grounded in actual data and experience, rather than speculative assumptions.

“At the same time, there are still things to improve on the assessment front. The review should include comprehensive evaluation criteria that cover all aspects of the regulation’s impact, including financial sustainability, governance practices, competitive balance, and fan engagement.

“It is important to involve a wide range of stakeholders in the review process, including football clubs, fans, industry experts, and regulatory bodies. The results of the review should be clearly reported to the public, along with an action plan outlining any proposed changes or improvements. This transparency will help build trust and demonstrate the government’s commitment to effective regulation.”",cityam

ASIDE from the two Group Two contests, Sha Tin’s supporting card has a number of gallopers on show who are capable of leaving their present ratings well behind before the season ends.

Highly regarded Ka Ying Glory, a half-brother to sprint sensation Ka Ying Rising, makes his debut in the first division of the Plantation Handicap (6.45am) over six furlongs, but faces stiff opposition from the likes of promising Sea Emerald and Loving Vibes.

Hat-trick seeking Horsepower will be all the rage in the Harlech Handicap (8.45am) over five furlongs, having finished strongly down the favoured stand rail last month.

He is likely to improve again, but a hefty eight-pound penalty and an outside draw tempers enthusiasm, and especially with the likes of La Forza, who clocked a fast time when sprinting clear of his rivals last start, and improving AURORA PATCH in opposition.

The latter, from the Pierre Ng stable, has finally learnt how to settle in his races after being a tearaway earlier in the season.

Having flashed home from a negative gate (two) when beaten just under a length in the race won by Horsepower last month, he now finds himself seven pounds better off for under a length defeat by the winner, and also better drawn in gate eight.

The John Size-trained Crossborderpegasus is another who will start at short-odds to continue his rise in class after two impressive career wins.

He looks likely to complete a hat-trick in the Homestead Handicap (10.25am) over six furlongs, but it may be worth taking a chance with outsider CALL ME GORGEOUS who finally draws a good gate (one) since arriving in Hong Kong.

More importantly to the fanatical local racing enthusiasts will be the return of their money-making machine, jockey Zac Purton, who is back in business after a seven-week break due to injury.

The likes of Beauty Eternal and consistent Chancheng Glory are likely alternatives but expect better from last year’s winner of this corresponding race, Beauty Joy, who has been earmarked for this contest by his stable for some time.

The world’s highest-rated sprinter Ka Ying Rising bids to extend his winning streak to 11 races with Purton back in the saddle, when stepping onto the track for The Sprint Cup (9.15am).

Change affects our lives in many ways.

However, many of us are less good at adapting to change than we thought.

Even positive changes can be stressful.

In other words, even if you think you're OK, you may be unconsciously accumulating stress.

Here are five ways to get along well with the changes that occur in your life.

Life doesn't know what will happen. But there's one thing that's certain. That means things change.

As long as we live, we will always face change. There are small changes, such as trying new shampoos, and there are also major changes, such as changing jobs or moving. Some changes are happy, while others are painful, such as breaking up with a partner or losing someone close to you.

Christopher Harvey, a senior manager at PwC and founder of his coaching service Harvey Sinclair, told Business Insider that humans are inherently bad at adapting to change.

Even if the change is positive, it will unconsciously be subject to psychological effects.

""If we get promoted or win a lottery, we don't think it's that good, right?"" Harvey said.

""You will soon feel happy and positive. But your thoughts will expand beyond your previous experience, making you more mentally unstable and emotionally ups and downs.""

People don't think about the impact that change has, Harvey said. This is because they believe they can adapt well to change, even though they are not.

However, if you accept major changes without facing them properly, things can break down. That's the same with relationships and careers, Harvey points out. ""You'll probably end up making terrible mistakes until you realize, 'What a bad thing about adapting to changes!'

Change brings deep stress on us. This is not the one you should fight for, it's the one you're going to get along well. Harvey listed five ways to get along well with the changes that occur in life.

It is also recommended to keep a diary. Rawpixel.com/Shutterstock

1. Know what you can and don't control

Changes can range from small to large. However, for example, economic depression cannot be done on your own.

""Just knowing if it's something you can control will make you feel better because you consciously think about it,"" Harvey said. ""Think about 'What do you actually do to take responsibility for?' and there may be something you can do if you do that.""

2. Make time to care for yourself

""Accepting that many changes have a negative impact, let's make time to consciously ""love yourself,"" Harvey said. ""You'll take the time to actually praise yourself.""

For example, when you move, you may feel depressed. In such cases, it's best to do things that you truly enjoy, rather than blaming yourself or overdoing yourself.

""Let's think it's 'It's okay.' You think, 'It might be frustrating for a couple of days, but tomorrow night, I'll go and see a movie and find a new friend,'"" Harvey said. By doing this, instead of worrying about it, you can give yourself time to adapt to change by doing something positive.",businessinsider

この研究をやり遂げるのには大変な苦労があった。まず、フレイと共同執筆者らは、2000万件の科学研究と400万件の特許のそれぞれがどの程度イノベーティブであるかを判断しなくてはならなかった。

これはまったく主観的な判断のように見えるかもしれないが、執筆者たちは賢明な手法を用いた。対象となる各研究について、その後の科学論文や特許に引用される頻度を調査し、同一テーマでそれ以前のものが、あまり引用されなくなったかどうかを確認したのだ。

当該研究が先行するものと一緒に引用された場合は、評価を下げ、革新性に欠けると判断した。それ以前の知識に基づいて組み立てられた数ある研究の一つに過ぎないと見なすわけだ。だが、当該研究が非常に画期的で、先行するものを凌駕する場合にはDスコアを付与した（例えば、DNAの二重らせん構造を発見したワトソンとクリックの1953年の論文は独創的であることから、非常に高いDスコアが付与された）。

次に、こうしてDスコアが付与された科学論文・特許それぞれに関わった研究者たちの居場所を確認した。これにより、チームメンバー間の距離に基づいて、関わった研究者たちが画期的な研究を生み出す確率を計算できるようになった。かくして、チームメンバー間の距離が近ければ近いほど、イノベーションを起こせる可能性が高いことが判明した。

問題は、その理由だ。従業員にフルタイムでのオフィス勤務に戻ることを求める経営幹部に尋ねれば、従業員をクリエイティブにしてくれる井戸端会議の魔法のような効用を言い出すかもしれない。

そして、それは大なり小なり正しいと言えそうだ。

フレイと共同執筆者らは科学論文のデータを調べ、関わった研究者が具体的に貢献した内容についてまとめた。同じ場所で一緒に働いたチームでは、研究者の多くが研究構想の初期段階から関与していた。

対照的に、遠隔で共同作業したチームでは、関与する研究者が独立した存在で、自分自身でアイデアを生み出す傾向があった。そして、研究の技術的な作業を、十分に状況を把握していないチームメンバーに任せていたのだ。

どうやら、初期の大局的な思考（いわば井戸端会議での議論）で、質の高い、協力的なやりとりをすることで、チームはより斬新なアイデアを追求するようになるようだ。

遠隔状態と同じ場所にいる状態との違いは、Slackで生煮えの考えを明瞭に伝えようとしたことがある人なら誰でも理解できるだろう。

「（論文を書こうとするとき）、それについて最初に交わす会話は、たいていそれほど明確なものにはなりません。すんなりとは進まないでしょう。誰かと同じ部屋にいると、何かがあればその人に質問をしたり、意見やフィードバックをもらったりすることができます。けれど、電話をしたりメールを送ったりしなければならないとなると、わざわざそんなことをする気にはならないでしょう」（フレイ）

慌ててオフィス出社を促す前に

さて、この1本の研究を参考にして、企業が慌てて職場方針を見直す前に、いくつか注意すべきことがある。

第一に、科学者や発明者の作業は、一般的な会社員のものとはかなり異なる。また、過去に遠隔での共同作業がイノベーションに役立たなかったからといって、将来もうまくいかないとは限らない。遠隔で共同作業するためのツールは、ここ数年で劇的に向上している。リモートワークやハイブリッドワークを促進するツールの市場がはるかに大きくなった今、今後数年間でさらに改善されるだろう。

しかし、対象データの驚くべき広さを考えると、この研究の結果は、リモートワーク時代の企業にいくつかのことを教えてくれる。

まず、従業員をオフィスに連れ戻す前に、自社の事業が「地道な改善」と「イノベーション」をどの程度必要としているのかを把握する必要がある。自社は革命的なイノベーションによってうまくいくのか、それともコツコツと改善することで成功を収めるのか。

専門職の仕事の大部分は、地道で派手さのないものだが、それは悪いことではない。「すでにプロダクトを生産している既存プレイヤーであれば、規模拡大と漸進的改善をサポートするテクノロジーに投資するほうが大きなメリットがある」とフレイは主張する。

それに、最も先駆的なテック企業でさえ、すべての従業員が、事業の中でイノベーションを必要とする中核部分、つまり刺激的な新しいものを創出する業務に関与するわけではない。

確かに、プロダクトチームのメンバーが直接顔を合わせれば、より良いアイデアにぶつかるかもしれない。しかし、経理、人事、ITなどの役割を担っている人たちは、イノベーターをサポートするためにそこにいるのであって、自分自身でイノベーションを起こすためにいるのではない。よって、在宅勤務でも問題ないはずだ。

これが、全社的なRTO（リターン・トゥ・オフィス）の義務化がほとんど意味をなさない理由の1つとなる。組織は、すべての人を同じように扱うのではなく、特定のチームや機能に沿って方針を実行するほうが賢明だろう。

全従業員を在宅勤務にしたい企業にとっても、この研究の結果には、イノベーションの機会を逃さないようにするためのヒントがある。それは、最上位の上司がアイデアを出して、部下に実行させるのではなく、全員がブレインストーミングに参加する方法、つまりオフィスでの井戸端会議のリモート版を作る方法を探すということだ。

Zoomで奇抜なアイデアを共有するのは恥ずかしいものだろう。しかしもしかしたら、そうしたアイデアの中には、ちょっとした才能を感じさせるものが含まれているかもしれない。目指すのは、リモートワークによるコスト削減や人材採用の利点と、オフィスで一緒に働くことによるイノベーションの追求という双方の強みを最大限に活かすことだ。

その両立を図ることは、個々の事業だけでなく、すべての人にとって不可欠だ。ゆっくりと着実に改善を進めれば、確かに経済は日々、活況を呈する。しかし、時間が過ぎていく中で生活水準を有意義に向上させるには、時には画期的な発見が必要となる。

だからこそ、エコノミストはテクノロジーにこだわり、彼らの多くが最近のアメリカの生産性の鈍化を懸念する。悲観論者は、人類は良いアイデアを使い果たしてしまったのだと断言する。

しかしフレイの研究は、皮肉なことに、過去数十年にわたって通信技術のあらゆるブレイクスルーにより促進されたリモートワークの台頭が、技術革新を低迷させる一因になっている可能性を示唆している。私たちが互いに離れて仕事をするほど、次の大きな機会の創出から遠ざかってしまう。

「馬車はいくらでも改良できます。しかし、自動車を作らないかぎり、個人が使う交通手段に革命を起こすことはできません。実際、このような根本的なブレイクスルーが必要とされているものの、その実現は十分とは言えないのです」（フレイ）

多くの日本企業には、「社内でキャリアアップするには、マネジメント職へ就くことが必要」という文化が未だ根付いているところも少なくはない。

そのような中、「専門性を極めたい」というスペシャリストの想いに応える新しい等級制度を導入したのが、パナソニック コネクトとパナソニック インダストリーだ。新制度のスペシャリスト職（※）では、個人の専門性や知見を発揮して活かすことでマネジメント職と同等の昇格・昇給が可能で、スキルや専門性を伸ばす一人ひとりのキャリアに合った研修プログラムも受けることができる。

パナソニックグループのスペシャリスト職は、どう働き、どのようなキャリアを築くことができるのか。両社の人事戦略における責任者の視点を通して、「マネジメント職以外のキャリア選択」の新たな可能性をひも解く。

※パナソニック コネクトではプロフェッショナル職にあたる役職。

「スペシャリストのまま上位職」の道が閉ざされていた

西阪章宏（にしさか・あきひろ）氏／パナソニック インダストリー 人事戦略統括部 統括部長。 1992年パナソニックグループへ新卒入社。オーディオ・テレビ・ディスプレイ・エナジー・オートモーティブなど複数の事業ならびに本社戦略本部でのリソースマネジメントを経て、2023年より現職。未来の社会・事業環境を見据え、企業価値向上・継続的な事業成長実現のため、事業基盤である「人・組織・文化」を常にアップデートしつづける変革のリードを図っている。

──スペシャリスト職にもマネジメント職と同等の昇格および昇給の道を設けた新しい等級制度を、パナソニック コネクトは2023年4月より、パナソニック インダストリーは2024年4月より導入しました。その経緯を教えてください。

西阪章宏（以下、西阪）：これまでパナソニック インダストリーでは、昇格するにはマネジメントの役割を担う必要があることがほとんどで、技術者などがプレイヤーとしてその道を極めながら昇格し、見合った報酬を得ることは極めてまれでした。しかし、キャリアに対する考え方や会社への貢献のあり方が多様化し、事業環境も大きく変わっていく中、既存の制度では事業強化の面に加え人材獲得や育成の面においても不十分ではないかと考えました。

そこで、2022年度にパナソニック インダストリーが事業会社化したのを機に、そうした課題感をふまえて新しい等級制度を導入しました。背景には、社員の「想い」を尊重し、その想いを動かすことを通して人と組織が共に成長し続けるという人材戦略があります。

杉本稚代（以下、杉本）：私たちパナソニック コネクトも、まったく同じような課題感を抱えていました。スペシャリストとして昇格できる制度自体はありましたが、運用する側に「マネジメントポジションでなければ上位職のポストには就けない」といった意識が根強くあり、スペシャリストの道は実質的に限定されていました。

この先スピード感と強度をもって事業を推進していくには、高い専門性をもつ人材の育成とあわせて、外部からそうした人材を招き入れることも不可欠です。そこで、専門人材の役職ポジションを増やすことを通してそれを実現し、組織能力を高めていくことになりました。

杉本稚代（すぎもと・ちよ）氏／パナソニック コネクト 人事総務本部 人事戦略室ダイレクター。外資保険会社や大手ITスタートアップなどを経て2019年に大手電機メーカーへ入社。Inclusion & Diversityを経てLearning & Development責任者を務め、ジョブ型人材マネジメントへの転換に向けたミドルマネジメント育成およびグローバルリーダー育成に携わる。2022年4月から現職。HR COEとして人事制度、プロセス等の変革を通じて人材・組織マネジメントをアップデートし組織能力の最大化を図っている。

──どのような制度なのか、具体的に教えてください。

杉本：一般的な管理職の一つ手前の役職から、マネジメント職とスペシャリスト職、2つのキャリアパスを設けました。さらにその上に役員クラスの役職をそれぞれ設けています。これにより、業界内における認知があり、卓越した知見を持つ人材を、役員に近い待遇で迎え入れることも可能になりました。

とはいえ、マネジメント職とスペシャリスト職のどちらかを一度決めたら変更することができないというわけではありません。変化の激しい時代において、キャリアの志向性が変化することは、十分にあり得ることです。なので、社内公募制度も活用しながら、自分のキャリア志向に合わせて、両方の職をチャレンジすることも可能です。

各ポジションに求められる要件を明確化した

西阪：パナソニック インダストリーも、体系としてはほぼ同じです。マネジメント職を7等級、スペシャリストを11等級とし、どちらも最上位を経営層にあたる等級としました。すでに、最上位等級をはじめ、上位層の等級となったスペシャリストも出始めています。なお、当社でもマネジメント職とスペシャリスト職をシームレスに行き来できます。

それに伴い、各ポジションに求められる要件を明確にし、それをオープンにしました。あわせて、研修のプラットフォームを整備し、各ポジションの役割にひもづいた研修プラグラムも案内しています。

杉本：パナソニック コネクトでも学びのプラットフォームを設け、やはり各ポジションのジョブディスクリプション（職務記述書）にひもづいた研修プログラムを受けられるようになっています。もちろん、それ以外でも自身の伸ばしたい領域に合わせて、プログラムは自由に受けることができます。

また、全社員が受講可能な英語研修のプラットフォームを設け、グローバルなコミュニケーション力の向上にも力を入れています。

──新しい等級制度の設計や運営で、苦労した点は何ですか。

西阪：スペシャリストが、何をもって事業に貢献しているかの解像度を上げることです。グローバル競争力のある技術基盤や顧客基盤を構築、さらにはプロセス革新など、将来のビジネスの可能性を開拓する任務をいかに評価するのか── 。そこでまず行ったのが、現場の部課長へのインタビューです。それぞれのポジションでどのような役割や責任、スキルが必要なのかを聞き出し、それを紡いで要件定義を作り上げていきました。

自分の頭と心でキャリアを選び続ける

西阪：もう一つ注力したのが、マネージャーの役割の再定義です。この等級制度で肝になるのが「社員の想いと会社のめざす姿をいかにつなげるか」で、それをつなぐマネージャーの役割がとても重要になります。メンバーから想いを引き出し、「では、この仕事とこのメンバーをつなげてみるのはどうだろう？」とか、「それなら、こんなスキルを伸ばしてみては？」などと伴走する役割ですね。

そこで当社では、上司とメンバーの1on1のコミュニケーションを活性化することを通して、新しい挑戦に向けた気付きが生まれやすいようにしています。

杉本：まさに当社でも、新しい等級制度を入れる段階で、マネージャーの力がすごく重要になってくるねという話が出ました。そこで、同じく上司・メンバー間のコミュニケーションをしっかり行うのとあわせ、マネージャースキルの養成にも力を注いできました。

──新しい等級制度がもたらすものとは、果たして何でしょう？

西阪：これまで多くの日本企業では、社員のやりたいことは上司や会社が決めるものといった文化がありました。したがって自身のキャリアに関しても、基本的には会社から“降りてくるもの”であると。対してこの等級制度であれば、仕事やキャリアを「自律的」に築いていける。そこが、決定的に違うところだと思います。

もちろん一度決めた道を突き詰めるのはすばらしいことですが、一方で世の中から求められることや自身がチャレンジしたいことは、やはり長いキャリアの中で変わるものでもあります。

だからこそ、キャリアの可能性をできるだけ広げ、自分が何をしたいのかを常に考えることを促す。キャリアにはいろいろな道があり、行きつ戻りつ、ジグザグしてもかまわない。そうした自律的なキャリアを、会社を辞めることなく作っていけるのが、この制度の良いところではないでしょうか。

杉本：まさに、自律的なキャリアやキャリアオーナーシップと言われるものを支える制度だと感じます。この先どうしたいのか、どのようになりたいのかを自分の頭と心で考えることがまずは大事。一方で私も経験がありますが、上司や周りの人に自分では見えなかったポテンシャルを示唆してもらうことでキャリアが一気に拓けるケースもあります。

だからこそ、心に響くものがあれば何でもチャレンジしてみることが大切で、そのハードルをグッと下げるのがこの制度であると考えています。

キャリア採用や職種をまたいだ異動が活発に

──新しい制度を導入後、どのような変化が起こっていますか。

杉本：パナソニック コネクトでは、社内公募制度で異動した人の内、34％が上位等級のポジションへ異動していますが、マネジメントだけでなく、スペシャリストの人も自らのチャレンジで昇格を実現しています。また、スペシャリスト登録率も増加しており、特に一般的な管理職の一つ手前の役職については、導入後約2年で約2倍に増えています。

西阪：パナソニック インダストリーでは、従業員満足度調査で「挑戦」の指標の数値が上がりました。キャリアの可能性が広がったことで、チャレンジの機運が高まっているのではないかと捉えています。あわせて研修の受講数が、事業会社化前年の2021年度と比べて4倍にも高まりました。また、キャリア採用比率は2021年度の36％から2023年度には52％に拡大。キャリア自律を実践している人々を目の当たりにする機会が増えたことも影響していると感じます。

──人事戦略を担う立場として、今後どのようなことを実現していきたいですか。

杉本：CONNECTer（従業員）が変革や成長を通して輝く「CONNECTers' Success」と当社の企業価値、ひいてはパナソニックグループの“企業価値向上とを紐付ける”、ここを突き詰めていきたいです。CONNECTer一人ひとりが力を発揮することでこそ、組織の力が大きくなり、強い会社になると思います。

西阪：杉本さんと同じく、社員が自分らしいキャリアを築いて輝くことで企業価値も高まると思うので、メンバーにはぜひ「想い」をぶつけていただきたいです。マネージャーがメンバーの想いを、会社のビジョンと紐付けながら昇華させていく。そのような関係性を深めていければなと。

それと、等級や評価の制度をアップデートし続けることも、私たちの大きな役目です。一度作ったら終わりではなく、常に変化する各職能や事業環境に合わせて、今後もアップデートを重ねていきたいです。",businessinsider

Since the revision of the ""anti-spy law"", crackdowns have progressed",https://www.businessinsider.jp/article/china-sentences-another-former-official-to-death-for-selling-secrets-abroad/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 15:05:00 GMT","Advertisement

In China, a former government official has been sentenced to capital punishment on spying charges.

On March 19, China's Ministry of National Security announced that a former engineer working for a Chinese research institution had been sentenced to death for selling secret state documents to foreign intelligence agencies. A similar ruling was issued in November 2024 on a former government employee.

On March 19, the province only announced the identity of the Chinese defendant who was sentenced to death as ""Liu."" After resigning from the governmental institute, which has easy access to state secret information, the defendant allegedly sold the secret information to foreign intelligence agencies and leaked it. It has not yet been disclosed where the defendant was formerly employed or the institution of the other country where the confidential documents were allegedly passed on. However, in a statement, the ministry warned against intelligence acts, saying, ""Outlaws who want to take the shortcut to the afterlife will receive reward.""

The British BBC pointed out that the announcement was a strong warning from Chinese authorities that ""foreign intelligence agencies are using the Chinese people as spies.""

According to the ministry, Liu left the institute and got a job at an investment company, but failed to invest and ended up in large debts, causing him to be forced to sell confidential information he had in possession to a foreign intelligence agency. However, he was seen at his feet and sold the information for a ""very cheap price.""

China's anti-spy law was amended in April 2023 and came into effect on July 1st of the same year. The targets of espionage have been expanded, extending it to not only national secrets but also to all information related to national security, and crackdowns have been strengthened. It highlights China's increasing focus on national security under President Xi Jinping.

In November 2024, it was discovered that a former Chinese government official was a double agent and was sentenced to death for ""spreading large amounts of top-secret state secrets to foreign intelligence agencies, seriously threatening China's national security.""

Also, after being indicted, Jan Hengjun, an Australian national author known for his blog on human rights issues in China, was sentenced to a suspended death sentence in February 2024, and was detained in 2019 at a Guangzhou airport. He was charged with involvement in espionage and was sentenced to death with suspended sentences. The detailed reasons for the espionage charges have not been revealed, and the Australian government is seeking Yang's release, but remains detained in China.",businessinsider

個人で使うPCと異なり、ビジネス向けのPCは、企業活動の業務効率を上げるためにもハイスペックなパフォーマンスや機能が求められる。

日常的な文書作成やメールの送受信だけでなく、大量のデータからの解析、複雑なシミュレーションなども含め、業務プロセスの効率化・最適化を追求する必要があるからだ。

また今後は、PC単体でのAI処理を実現するNPU（Neural Processing Unit）のパフォーマンスも重視する必要がある。

AIといえば画像を作り出す生成AIのイメージを持つ人が多いかもしれないが、口語で質問し疑問点を解消できるチャット、ルーチンワークの自動化、無駄なプロセスを特定して作業効率化を進めるといった使い方において、AIの価値は高まってきているのだ。

企業のAI活用に適した法人向けPCの筆頭と言えるのが、ASUS初の企業向けビジネスCopilot＋ PC 「ASUS ExpertBook P5 (P5405CSA)」だ。

インテル® Core™ Ultra プロセッサー（シリーズ2）を搭載している同機は、上位モデルなら47TOPS（※）、下位モデルでも40TOPSのNPU AI処理能力を持つ。さらにGPUやCPUを組み合わせることで、AI処理能力は115TOPSにまで拡張される。

※TOPS：1秒間あたりに実行できる演算回数（1TOPSは1兆回／秒）

アルヴィン・チェン社長に聞く、現代のビジネスPCに求められる姿

アルヴィン・チェン氏／ASUS JAPAN 代表取締役社長。2008年ASUSTeK Computer Inc.入社。香港やタイで事業拡大を牽引し、タイではPC市場シェア向上に貢献。2019年よりASUS JAPAN代表取締役社長を務め、日本市場向けに「ASUSのあんしん保証」など革新的なサービスを導入。グローバルな経験を活かし、さらなる成長を目指す。

「重要なのは、AIの機能を使ってどんなニーズを満たすのか」だと話すのは、ASUS JAPANのアルヴィン・チェン社長。ビジネスノートPCのAI性能については、どのように考えているのだろうか。

「ASUSはビジネスノートPCに求められるAIソリューションとして、議事録を取ったりデータ処理をしたりすることに対する需要が大きいと考えています。 それらの業務にかかる時間を短縮できる製品として、ASUS ExpertBook P5を開発しました」（チェン氏）

ビジネスシーンでのAI活用は日に日に増え、クラウドで動作する対話型AIサービスも普及しているが、その正確性に関しては疑問を持つことも重要だと話す。

「対話型AIサービスで作成したテキストやデータを業務に活用するビジネスパーソンもいますが、そのコンテンツが本当に正しいものなのかはユーザー自身が判断する必要があります。また他とは違う独自性を追求する必要もあるでしょう」（チェン氏）

この言葉からは、エッジAI（端末側で処理するAI）の重要性が浮かんでくる。

現に、世の中のAIスタートアップは、LLM（大規模言語モデル）だけではなく、さまざまな業務用途にフィットするオーダーメイドのAIモデルを急ピッチで開発している。

その点からも、高いAI処理能力を持つASUS ExpertBook P5が活躍する未来が見えるだろう。

ASUS初のビジネスAI PCが持つ価値

では、ASUS ExpertBook P5の具体的なストロングポイントはどこにあるのだろうか。

「インテルは、インテル® Core™ Ultra プロセッサー（シリーズ2）で色々な変革を起こしました。CPUとNPUのパフォーマンスが進化しただけではなく、バッテリー消費も改善しました。実際にASUS ExpertBook P5を朝の9時から19時まで10時間連続で使い続けても、バッテリーが30％も残るというロングライフを実現しています」（チェン氏）

「ASUS ExpertBook P5は100～1000人単位の従業員を持つ企業での導入を想定しています。具体的にはセキュリティやネットワーク、基本アプリケーションのセットアップといった作業を簡単に行うことができます」（チェン氏）

特に、チェン氏が強調したのは、メンテナンス性、セキュリティ性能というビジネスノートPCに求められるものの両立だ。

「ASUS ExpertBook P5はネジ8本で簡単に開閉でき、パーツの交換がスムーズに行えます。特に中小企業では専任のIT担当者がいないことが多いため、シンプルな構造によってメンテナンスの負担を軽減します」（チェン氏）

一方で、セキュリティ対策も万全。

「シャーシ侵入検知機能を搭載しており、筐体が開かれると、自動で記録を開始。これにより、ITチームが不正な開封やセキュリティ侵害のリスクを監視しやすくなります。企業の情報資産を守るための重要な機能です」（チェン氏）

またこのPCには、ASUS独自のAI機能である「ASUS AI ExpertMeet」も搭載した。

「業務上のコミュニケーションに欠かせないオンラインミーティングに関する機能を一元的にまとめたもので、AIミーティング議事録では会議の内容を記録、要約、翻訳することが可能（※）です。 さらに、オンラインミーティングでの資料投影時に情報漏洩防止として使用が可能なAIウォーターマーク機能もあります」（チェン氏）

※現状、翻訳元言語は日本語に未対応

そのほか、ノイズキャンセリング、肌の色を調整するオートカラーフィルターといった機能も備えている。

各種機能に加えて、ハードウェア、ソフトウェアへの信頼性の高さも、ASUS ExpertBook P5の価値だ。

「まず本体そのものに高い耐久性があります。米国軍事規格のMIL規格 (MIL-STD-810H)に適合し、6万回以上の耐久テストを行っています。 ソフトウェア面に関しては、1年間のアンチウイルスライセンス、BIOSとドライバに対する5年間のセキュリティ更新、Windows 11のSecured-core PC技術の対応、生体認証ログインなど、さまざまな技術で大切なデータを守ります。 またサードパーティーとコラボをして、オフライン・オンラインを問わずマイナンバーカードやパスポートなどの個人情報しっかりとロックできる、セキュリティ機能のアップデートを計画しています」（チェン氏）

なお、本体そのものの耐久性に加え、I/Oポートの耐久性も強化されており、デバイスの寿命を延ばし、長期間安定した使用を可能にしているという。

新しいビジネスの芽が生まれるかもしれない。それがASUS ExpertBook P5

ASUS ExpertBook P5は「法人モデル導入の第一歩としておすすめしたい」とチェン氏は話す。

「ASUS ExpertBook P5は単なるビジネスPCではなく、生産性アップのためのツールと捉えています。AIアシスタント機能を使うことによってさまざまな業務の効率化をすることができますし、機能の使い方もわかりやすく設計しています。誰にとっても価値があるPCとして、幅広く使っていただけると思います。 またASUSはマネージャーアプリによって、PCの一元管理ができるソリューションを提供しています。 大企業のIT・システム調達部の方だけではなく、専門の部署を持たない中小企業の方々でも管理しやすいので、ビジネスPCのファーストステップとしてもおすすめしたいですね」（チェン氏）

企業内PCを刷新するとき、専門知識をそれほど持たないユーザーでも社員のPCを管理しやすいのは大きなメリットだ。DX化を推進している最中の企業にとっても、導入時の手間を削減することができるだろう。

Management for younger people that should not be done",https://www.businessinsider.jp/article/2503-managers-generationz/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 11:01:00 GMT","In particular, when managing Generation Z, it is necessary to understand the generational background. shutterstock/polkadot_photo

""Why do I have to do that work?""

Have you ever heard such comments from young people in the company?

It's understandable that the boss lamented, ""The younger generations these days..."", but it is not possible to move the members by simply repeating one-sided instructions without understanding the generational background of the young members.

What kind of management method is that it understands the environment in which the young members grew up, and the values ​​that come from them, and then moves them?

I have been involved in the management and management of venture companies for a long time, and currently runs a company that provides technical management training for managers.

Based on his experience providing training to a total of approximately 2,000 managers, this time we will focus on young members of Gen Z (born in the mid-1990s to the 2010s) and introduce specific management techniques to help drive this generation.

Nagamura Tadatsugu, CEO of EVeM Graduated from Osaka University in 2006. After working at Recruit, DeNA, and How Television, EVeM was established to train venture managers. At DeNA, he is also responsible for the Advertising Business Division, Director of AMoAd, and Head of President Perori's Office and Head of Human Resources. At Howe Television, he will lead the company to be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Mothers as director and COO. EVeM was founded in 2020. In 2021, he published ""The Type of Managers That Lead to Rapid Growth: ""Even Management in an Era of Eras of Position and Power Not Approach.""

Gen Z ""bred in an environment where people can easily have doubts""

Why do Gen Z stick to ""Why"" at work?

Hirayama Ayako, director of MERY Generation Z Research Institute, which operates a marketing business for Gen Z at the Shogakukan Group, points out the impact of social media.

""Generation Z is a generation that has a sense that it is natural to see anything through social media from a young age. It can be said that they grew up in an environment where people tend to question what they were doing. Therefore, there is a strong tendency to seek the background and reasons for everything,"" says Hirayama.

This is because this generation was the norm to see so much, and this generation is the generation that seeks ""Why.""

Whether they are performing one task at hand or making big decisions such as choosing their future career, the obvious ""Why"" is what will become the driving force behind them.

That's why it's important to manage answering ""Why.""

Why ""create this document"" is bad

So, what kind of management skills are specifically needed?

Three key words that are effective in managing a generation that doesn't ""try it for now"" are ""purpose"", ""fact"", and ""significance"". I would like to introduce each of them.

The first one is ""purpose.""

This is the technique of giving instructions in conjunction with the purpose when instructing a task.

For example, it would be difficult for Gen Z, who are concerned about why, to give an unpurposed instruction to ""create this material."" With increasing numbers of chat communication, not only face to face, but also increasing, the fact that this is an unpurposed instruction seems even more prominent.

The key is to convey your purpose. For example, if you just ask them to ""create this material because their competitors are gaining power, so they want to watch their trends,"" the way they are accepted is quite different.

When young members ask why they need to do this task, their boss generation often mistakenly mistakenly think that they are being ""repulsed."" If this makes your boss stubborn and gives even more forceful instructions, such as ""It's fine, do it first,"" the repulsion will become even greater, and a major rift will arise in the relationship between the boss and the members.

However, the members are not in any way opposed. This is a very common question for generations who grew up in an environment where they tend to have doubts. ""I'm just listening normally.""

If you understand the background of this generation, you will naturally understand the need to give instructions in conjunction with your purpose.

When I talk about this kind of thing, I often get rebuttal by saying, ""Even though I'm already busy, I can't explain my purpose every time.""

So, try entering the words ""Competitions are gaining power, so I want to watch these trends"" on your PC, which was mentioned in the example above. You'll notice that you can hit it in just a few seconds. It just feels psychologically troublesome, and it doesn't take long enough to interfere with your work to explain your purpose and background.

It is a good idea to make sure that the instructions are given in conjunction with the purpose.",businessinsider

熊本優子氏（以下、熊本）：日本ではコロナ禍以前から人手不足感が高まっていて、求人市場は活況です。特に、女性の転職者は10年前と比べて約5倍に増え、契約社員や派遣社員から正社員に転職する女性は約6倍になったというデータもあります。

田中研之輔教授（以下、田中）：数年前と比べて、「誰でも、何歳からでもキャリアは築いていける」という社会的風潮が広がりつつありますよね。

それは、コロナ禍による変化に加えて、飛躍的なテクノロジーの発展、企業の人事制度改革など、いくつかのムーブメントがあるからでしょう。

例えば、結婚や子育てをしている女性は、キャリアを諦めなくてはならない時代もありました。ですが、多様な選択肢がある今は、そんな必要はありません。また、一つの企業で働き続けてきたミドルシニアが、定年前後に新たなチャレンジをする事例も増えています。

まさに労働市場が開かれ、“転職の多様性”が進んでいると実感しています。

田中研之輔氏。法政大学キャリアデザイン学部 教授、一般社団法人プロティアン・キャリア協会 代表理事、BOOST Health CHRO、キャリアナレッジ 代表取締役社長。専門はキャリア論、組織論。主著は『プロティアン―70歳まで第一線で働き続ける最強のキャリア資本論』。メディアでも多数連載を持ち、プログラム開発・新規事業開発を得意とする。

熊本：おっしゃる通りだと思います。企業側も、個々の状況に合わせた働き方を尊重し、働き方にまつわる制度の変更や従業員を受け入れる際の工夫をされる事も多くなりました。

ただそうはいっても、次のキャリアへの一歩を踏み出す方はまだ多くはないと感じています。

日本の就業者数は約6780万人いる中で、転職を希望する人は年間約1000万人。その中で実際に転職する人は330万人ほどと言われています。

もちろん転職は選択肢の一つであり、すればよいというわけではない前提ですが、現状に何かしらモヤモヤを感じていても、キャリアの主導権を自分で握り一歩を踏み出すことには、まだまだ多くの方がハードルを感じていらっしゃるのではないでしょうか。

松原大悟氏（以下、松原）：私は日々、キャリアに何かしらの課題を感じていらっしゃる方と向き合っていますが、寄せられる悩みは本当に幅広いです。「新卒1年目で転職できますか？」「55歳で役員まで務めたけれど、プレイヤーに戻りたい」など、さまざまな相談をいただきます。

掘り下げて伺ってみると、仕事の条件ベースの悩みだけではなく、「プライベートの時間を大切にしたい」、「家族との時間を増やしたい」など、人生軸で仕事のあり方を考えていらっしゃることも多い。それぞれが叶えたい理想が異なるからこそ、相談の内容も多様になっているのだと思います。

「半ば諦めていた」転職を実現させたポイントは……

リクルートエージェントの松原大悟氏。地方公務員として児童福祉業務にて経験を積み、2023年にリクルートに入社。『リクルートエージェント』のキャリアアドバイザーとして、さまざまな業界・職種の求職者の転職をサポート。“納得感のある転職活動”を実現すべく伴走している。

──キャリアチェンジを遂げた方の、印象的なエピソードを教えてください。

松原：契約社員やパート、派遣社員として事務職を経験されてきたシングルマザーの女性がいらっしゃいました。

面談をすると「仕事に物足りなさを感じるから、キャリアアップしたい。ただ、子どものお迎えがあるから、今までのように17時半までには仕事を終えたい」と。

加えて、いろいろなエージェントと面談してきたけれど「そもそも非正規から正規になるのは難しい」「労働時間の制約があると厳しい」と言われてしまっていたそうで、転職を半ば諦めていました。

私は、キャリアアドバイザーとして「絶対にあきらめずサポートします」とお伝えした上で、何を叶えたいのかを聞きました。すると、「子どもが大学生になるまで金銭面でも生活を支え、きちんと育てていくことが人生の目標です」と。

現状の給料では生活の不安もあるということで、転職活動を進めることになりました。

数十社の面接を受けるもなかなかうまくいきませんでしたが、最終的にIT系の営業の仕事に転職することができました。年収も80万円ほど上がったうえ、希望の時間までに帰宅することができ、自宅からのアクセスも良いところに転職できたんです。

私が驚かされたのは、その方は転職活動後も自発的にITに関する資格を取得するなど、スキルを身に付けることにチャレンジされていたことです。一歩踏み出された方は、さらに前向きになり、より頑張ることができるんだなと思った出会いでした。

キャリアのブレーキになるのは、「無意識のバイアス」

（写真はイメージです） Shutterstock / ZephyrMedia

──キャリアアドバイザーとして、具体的にはどんな伴走をしたのでしょうか？

松原：スタート時点から、その方の強みを感じていました。面談前から一生懸命準備されていたり、子どもが起きる前であろう早朝にメールを送っていらっしゃったり……「自分の人生を変えたい」という思いに誠実に向き合い、継続的に努力ができるという方であることが伝わってきていました。

またよく話を聞くと、データ収集などの事務のスキルが高いことも判明しました。

その方は「当たり前だと思っていた」と話されていましたが、私の過去の面談経験から「通常であれば2人分の仕事」を1人で担っている場面があるように見受けられました。そのことをお伝えすると、自分の強みとしてアピールできることなのだと自信を持っていただくことができました。

田中：その方は、きっと強みを自分で理解しきれていなかったのですね。第三者からアドバイスをもらうことで、気づくことが多かったのではないでしょうか。

キャリア開発のブレーキの一つは何かと言ったら、本人の中にある「無意識のバイアス」です。

「私なんか……」と思い込んでいたり、身近な人から「あなたは仕事ができない」と言われて、本来の能力に気がつけていなかったりする人も多いんです。

熊本：特に主婦・主夫の方や働いていない期間が長い方は、「私なんか」というマインドが強いように感じます。

リクルートエージェントが実践していることの一つで、家事や育児のスキルをビジネススキルに変換するフレームワークがあるんです。エピソードを聞きながら、時間管理能力やコミュニケーション能力など、その方の強みを見つけていく。

日常生活で当たり前にやっていたことが、実はビジネススキルにもつながると気づくことで、その方の自信にもなるんですよね。

田中：とてもいい取り組みですね。子育てや家事も立派なキャリア資本ですよね。

モヤモヤから抜け出す、3つのポイント

──改めて、キャリアのモヤモヤを抱えている人が“次の一歩”を踏み出すためにはどうしたらいいのでしょうか？

田中：私がよくお伝えしているキーワードは、「内省」、「棚卸し」、そして「対話」です。

自分自身と向き合い、棚卸しをする。もちろん簡単にできればいいのですが、これがなかなか自分一人では難しい。そんなときこそ、第三者との対話は有効です。

熊本：まさに、キャリアアドバイザーのコアバリューは内省のご支援だと思っています。

ご自身の強みや自分らしさ、成し遂げたいことを自覚している方は少ないと思うんです。モヤモヤしている感覚の方が多いんじゃないかなと。それを一緒に考えて、言語化するお手伝いをさせていただきたいなと。

私たちは年間約8万人の転職を支援させていただいているので、客観的にお伝えできることもあると考えています。

田中：そうですよね。僕はぜひ「キャリアを悩む」のではなく「キャリアを考える」ように変わってほしいと思っているんです。

半年後、1年後、5年後……どうなりたいか、未来軸で内省してみてほしい。

僕自身も15年以上、定期的に内省の時間をとっています。今の仕事は、自分のやりたいことにつながっているのか？ 自分じゃないとできないことなのか？ と問い、考え続けています。

また加えて、さまざまな選択肢を考える機会も設けてほしいですね。やりたいことを実現するには、自分が知らない・思いつかないような選択肢があることも多いですから。

熊本：そうですよね。選択肢を広げるという点では、私たちは内省の支援をすると同時に転職の市況・企業の求めているスキルの変化をタイムリーにキャッチできるため、その時々のニーズに合わせて求職者の強みを企業にお伝えし、可能性を紡ぐことができます。

そうすることで、時には、異業種・異職種など当初思ってもみなかった選択につながることもあります。

またリクルートエージェントでは、AIを使ったマッチングテクノロジーを一部で活用しています。これまでの転職支援に関する情報を読み込んで可能性を提示できるAIは、活用しない手はないと考えています。テクノロジーも活用しながら、求職者の方の選択肢を広げる支援ができたらと思っているんです。

何歳でも、どんな状況でも遅くはない

──最後に、今後の展望とキャリアに悩む方々へのメッセージをお願いします。

熊本：リクルートエージェントには多様なキャリアアドバイザーがいて、日々たくさんの方と面談しています。

田中先生が「当事者意識を持とう」と話されていたように、キャリアの手綱を自分で握ることがすごく大事だと思っています。自分で手綱を握って、自分で決めていくことで、モチベーションやワクワクが生まれ、さらなる成長・活躍につながっていくと思うんです。

そのためにも、転職する・しないに関わらず、ご自身の選択に納得感を持っていただけるサポートを目指しています。転職活動をしてみた結果、現職で頑張るという選択をされる方もいらっしゃるのですが、ご本人が納得のいく選択ができていたらこんなに嬉しいことはありません。

松原：私たちキャリアアドバイザーが「これがいいですよ」とか「これしかないです」と言うのではなくて、いろいろな選択肢を提示した上で、最終的にどうしたいのかを選びとっていただくためのお手伝いを、今後も続けていきたいです。

田中：キャリアアドバイザーは、もはやプロデューサーですね。その人の可能性の芽を摘まないこと。話を聞き対話し、ときにAIの情報収集力とアドバイザーとしての経験を融合させ、それぞれにチューニングした情報を届ける。

パーソナルトレーナーが、体型を変えるためのトレーニングをサポートするのと同じように、キャリアアドバイザーもその人が変わるための伴走をする。

キャリアにモヤモヤを感じている方は、まずは相談して内省することからはじめていただきたいですね。必ずしも転職をしなくてもいいし、選択肢を導き出して、動いていくことに意味があるわけですから。何歳でも、どんな状況でも遅くはありませんよ。

LEGO has appointed a Pokemon with a huge fan base as partner in the new collection.

A new collaboration with Pokemon has been announced, and the release is scheduled for 2026.

This means that LEGO is strengthening its acquisition of adult consumers.

Danish toy maker Lego is taking advantage of the rising millennial nostalgia for the Pokémon series to give the Japanese popular brand a bit of love.

On March 18, LEGO, Pokemon and Pokemon UK announced their partnership in an Instagram post.

The video announced shows how the new product is not revealed, but yellow LEGO blocks gather together and Pikachu's lightning-shaped tail is being created. Pikachu is the most beloved Pokemon character.

""Preparing for your imagination to be electrocuted in 2026,"" the caption reads. It is not stated that sometime in 2026.

A LEGO spokesperson told Business Insider that both companies have a long history of pushing the boundaries of social games, and that's the core of this partnership.

Released in 1996 as Nintendo's Kameboy software, the Pokemon brand experienced as a child by many millennials, has become one of the world's largest media and retail franchises with billions of dollars in product sales, including TV anime and mobile apps.

Nintendo said in March that series-related software has shipped over 480 million copies, and trading cards have sold at 64.8 billion.

More than 30 billion of these were made during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Industry watchers say it's a surge due to millennial and Gen Z consumers spending money on their childhood passions.

The pandemic will also increase the value of Pokemon cards as assets, with some new auctions worth up to $5,275,000 (approximately 790 million yen).

Pokemon isn't the only media series that LEGO has nominated for collaboration. There are also sets from the Star Wars and Harry Potter series.

The collaboration comes shortly after LEGO reported that annual revenues increased by 13% in 2024 to 74.3 billion Danish kroner (approximately 1.6 trillion yen).

Lego CEO Niels B. Christiansen said in its annual report on March 11 that the number of adult buyers is increasing.

""While the main target is still children, the LEGO Botanical Collection has increased demand among teens and adults, attracting new builders to the LEGO brand.""",businessinsider

一方、イーロン・マスク氏率いるテスラは、高価なLiDARセンサーを搭載せずとも光学カメラのみで自動運転車を大規模展開することができるとの立場だ。

コストの観点からLiDARセンサーを不要とするテスラの主張に、クラフチック氏はこう反論する。

「LiDARを含むロバストなセンサー群のコストは、1マイル当たりで考えれば微々たるもの。（測定データを使った）3Dマッピングのコストは言わずもがな。人的被害の削減という観点で測定される安全面のメリットは重大かつ検証可能なものです」

ウェイモに競合相手はいない

2021年4月にウェイモを離れ、現在はロバート・J・スカリンジ氏率いるリビアン（Rivian）の取締役を務めるクラフチック氏は、米中両国はじめ複数の企業が自動運転車を使った配車サービスを世界中で開発・展開しているものの、ウェイモの独走状態に変化はないと断言する。

中国のバイドゥ（Baidu、百度）が展開するロボタクシーサービス「アポロ・ゴー（Apollo Go）」は2024年第4四半期だけでおよそ110万回の配車実績を記録した。

アマゾン（Amazon）が2020年6月に買収したズークス（Zoox）は目下、カリフォルニア州サンフランシスコとネバダ州ラスベガスで試験走行を積み重ねており、2025年下半期にも商業運行を開始する計画だ。

テスラも前出のサイバーキャブを使った配車サービスをテキサス州オースティンで6月に開始する（とマスク氏が公言している）。

一方のウェイモはカリフォルニア州ロサンゼルス、サンフランシスコ、アリゾナ州フェニックスでロボタクシーサービス「ウェイモ・ワン（Waymo One）」を展開し、配車実績はすでに週20万回以上に及んでいる。

オースティンやジョージア州アトランタでも配車サービス大手ウーバー（Uber）と提携して自動運転サービスを提供しており、さらに米国外での初展開に向けて東京でも走行試験に乗り出している。

「現時点で言えば、ウェイモに競合相手はいません」

そう語るクラフチック氏によれば、ウェイモはサービス規模、安全性、性能の観点で圧倒的な優位性を誇り、今後3〜5年は他社に追いつかれそうにないという。

「あらゆる車両に統合可能な、免許証を有する人間の運転を代行するエンボディード（身体性をもって物理世界と相互作用する）AIの社会実装に成功、なおかつサードパーティーのデータを用いてその規模を拡大し、運転能力と安全性について人間のドライバーに対する顕著な優位性を実証した唯一の企業がウェイモなのです」

またズークスに関して、クラフチック氏は「大きな期待」を寄せており、「市場参入に向けた慎重かつ入念な取り組み」を高く評価した。ただし、そのサービス運営規模は2018年にウェイモが初めてロボタクシーを展開した時に比べると見劣りするという。

さらに、中国企業についてクラフチック氏は具体名には言及しなかったものの、（中国国内より当局による規制が厳格と見られる）米国内でのサービス展開に至っていないことを踏まえ、ウェイモ並みの自動運転性能を実現できているとは考えにくいと指摘する。

例えば、トヨタ自動車の大規模出資先で2024年11月に米ナスダック上場を果たしたポニー・エーアイ（Pony.ai、小馬智行）は、カリフォルニア州で試験運転中に交通違反を複数回繰り返し、2022年5月に同州自動車局から無人運転の許可を取り消されている。

配車サービスは「最終目的地」ではない

クラフチック氏によれば、ウェイモは当初から配車サービスの実現だけを目指してきたわけではなく、現在も「ウェイモの自動運転車への（優先的もしくは無制限の）アクセスを保証する」サブスクリプションサービスや、大型トラックもしくは自家用車にもデプロイ可能な自動運転ソフトウェアの製品化まで見据えているという。

そうした大きな成長余地を踏まえて、アナリストの中にはウェイモの新規株式公開（IPO）や親会社アルファベット（Alphabet）からのスピンアウトを予想する向きもある。

資産運用会社ディープウォーター・アセット・マネジメント（Deepwater Asset Management）のジーン・マンスター氏は2024年11月、ウェイモが2〜4年以内にアルファベットからスピンアウトし、2030年には評価額3500億〜8500億ドルの巨大企業（OpenAIの最新評価額が3000億ドル）に成長するとの見通しを語っている。

ただ、ウェイモが2016年にアルファベットの独立子会社として分社化を果たした時の経営トップであるクラフチック氏は確信を持ってこう語る。",businessinsider

AI-focused startup exclusively reveals pitch decks that raised $23.5 million,https://www.businessinsider.jp/article/2503-pitch-deck-ai-marketing-agent-startup-auxia-raise-vc-funding/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 06:40:00 GMT","Auxia co-founders Sandeep Menon (right) and CTO Ravi Dess (left). Auxia

AI agents are revolutionizing marketing and sales, and a startup in this sector has successfully raised $23.5 million (approximately 3.525 billion yen, equivalent to 1 dollar = 150 yen).

The startup called Auxia has announced the success of the Series A and seed funding round led by VMG Technology Partners. Mitsubishi UFJ Innovation Partners, Incubate Fund, Vela Partners and Stage 2 Capital also participated in the round, with more than 50 industry leaders joining the investment, including Lorraine Twohill, Google's Chief Marketing Officer, Arjan Dijk, Booking.com's CMO, and David Fischer, former Chief Business Officer at Meta.

Founded in Palo Alto in 2022, Auxia is a marketing platform that uses AI to create personalised purchasing experiences for consumers. The startup's AI agent analyzes customer data and delivers personalized marketing content such as email coupons, text messages, and push notifications to help you make your purchases.

For Auxia co-founder and CEO Sandeep Menon, the rise of AI agents over the past year has helped bridge the gap between collecting customer data and its effective use.

""We consider AI agents to be game changers. They seamlessly integrate into existing workflows, enhancing everything from content creation to digital experience development, to analyzing and optimizing deep data,"" he told Business Insider.

As technology matures, we expect AI agents to become essential for businesses to expand their operations, personalise engagement and drive strategic decision-making.

AI agents are currently in the midst of a pandemic in Silicon Valley, and investors are trying to bring autonomous technology to multiple industries. Marketing is no exception. Startups like Jasper, Rox and 11x are all starting to integrate AI agents into their marketing products and support salespeople.

Jasper raised $125 million in 2022 in the Series A round led by Insight Partners, with a valuation of $1.5 billion (approximately 225 billion yen). Meanwhile, both Rox and IIx ran a funding round last year. Rocks announced a total of $50 million seed and Series A funding from GV, Sequoia and General Catalyst in November, with A16z leading the 11x $50 million Series B in the same month.

Other startups have taken a horizontal approach. Vapi sells industry-independent AI voice agents that can be programmed to perform tasks such as scheduling doctor appointments, training employees, and outbound sales and marketing calls. The startup raised $20 million in December.

Menon said there is a competitive advantage as Auxia is focused on bringing the best AI agent experience to the marketing field.

""The world is rapidly moving towards autonomous systems, and we firmly believe that AI-powered agents will bring opportunities for change for the entire marketing and product team,"" he says.

These agents are not just tools, but represent fundamental changes in the way businesses run. Efficiency in workflows, automate complex tasks, and enable teams to move faster and more efficiently than ever before.

「ブランドの核となる人物の立ち位置としては非常に危ういものです」

就寝の準備時間に参加必須の全社ミーティングを設定すれば、従業員の士気は下がるだろう。

また、従業員の時間は（会社のためにいつでも提供させられるという意味で）無価値との誤ったシグナルを発することで「信頼関係を決定的に毀損」（シリング教授）しかねない。

起業して間もない成長期、初期段階なら、企業として定めた基準や規範を無視して（深夜や週末の作業になりふり構わず取り組むなど）無理を通すこともあるかもしれない。しかしテスラはとうにそうした時期を過ぎている。

「マスク氏はすでにその行動が多くの人々に影響を及ぼし、多くの人々を巻き込む可能性のある存在であり、もはや少年時代の悪ふざけでは済まないのです」

マスク氏はこれまで疑問視されるような問題発言・行動をたびたび繰り返してきたが、なぜか好意的に解釈されて特に深刻な咎（とが）めを受けずにきた。

それでも、テスラの株価が12月に更新した史上最高値から80％下落（3月24日終値時点で42％）するといった深刻な危機に対処せねばならなくなった場合、さすがの熱狂的マスク氏支持者らも寛容ではいられないというのがシュローター氏の見方だ。

過去にはオフィスの床で寝泊まり

マスク氏の仕事に向き合う姿勢が注目を浴びるのは今回が初めてではない。

ミッドサイズ電動セダン『モデル3』の生産遅延からテスラが「地獄」を味わっていた2018年春、マスク氏は工場に泊まり込んで床で寝ていたと公言している。

さらに、2022年10月に買収したツイッター（Twitter、現X）の経営改革を進めていた時期も、自らサンフランシスコ本社のソファで寝泊まりするだけでなく、従業員にも「ハードコア」な働き方を求め、実際に管理職クラスのエンジニアがオフィスの床で寝ている様子が撮影されている。

創業者らしく何でも派手にやるのがマスク流の経営とは言え、就寝時間前の全社ミーティングは準備不足ないし（多忙さにかまけて）会社の有事に気づくのが遅れた事実をさらけ出しただけにすぎない、と前出のシュローター氏はにべもない。

ただ、3月20日深夜の全社ミーティングでマスク氏が発したメッセージは投資家にはそれなりに響いたようで、結果的に翌21日、さらに週明け24日の株価は大きな回復ぶりを示した。

なお、マスク氏がそのミーティングで語ったことを端的に要約すれば、ロボットタクシー「サイバーキャブ（Cybercab）」や人間型ロボット「オプティマス（Optimus）」の市場投入を前に、投資家はテスラ株を「絶対手放すべきではない」ということだった。

カオスな何かを期待する心理

ベストセラー『ロングゲーム』の著者でコロンビア大学ビジネススクールでも教鞭を執るドリー・クラーク氏は、テスラ以外の企業なら従業員が眉をひそめたり不安を抱いたりするであろう突然の深夜ミーティングをなぜかマスク氏が開催できてしまうのは、ほとんどの人が「カオス感があって」型破りな何かを彼に期待しているからだと分析する。

「何しろ、マスク氏は（全米で人気のポッドキャスト番組）ジョー・ローガン・エクスペリエンスでマリファナを吸った人物です」

マスク氏はもともと場当たり的で、感情に左右される経営者として知られ、そういう認識が定着しているゆえに、予測不能で一貫性のない行動も「あえて懸念するほどのことではない」といった受け止めに終始するところがある、とクラーク氏は語る。

そうした現実の文脈を踏まえると、深夜の無茶なミーティングはむしろ、マスク氏がこれまでと変わらず会社の経営を深く気にかけているという従業員へのメッセージと受け止められた可能性もある。

そして、仮にそうだとしても、テスラが抱える課題の解消に向けて具体的に取り組んでいることを示すさらなる行動が後に続かなければ、従業員と投資家のポジティブなセンチメントを維持するのは難しいとクラーク氏は指摘する。

スティーブ・ジョブズ「崇拝」と同じ

前出のシュローター氏も、マスク氏が全社ミーティングを開いて従業員に直接訴えた判断は、一斉メールを送信したり従業員コミュニケーションを担当するチームに一任したりするよりずっと効果的だったと語る。

「たとえビデオ会議だったとしても、従業員の前に姿を見せて語りかけ、感情を見せるだけで全く結果は異なるものになります。経営者も従業員と同じ懸念を共有しているんだと示す効果があるのです」

ただし、そうした方法がどのくらい深く響くかは、従業員側にどの程度「火中の栗を拾う」覚悟があるか次第だという。

アップル（Apple）共同創業者のスティーブ・ジョブズ氏と同じくらい、テスラ従業員のマスク氏に対する忠誠心は高く、長時間労働も含めて何としてでも高い期待に応えようとするだろう、シュローター氏はそう語る。

「イーロン・マスクの存在は唯一のもの。別に私自身が彼を崇拝しているからそう言うのではありません。目の前の事実をありのままに言えばそういうことになるのです」

実際、マスク氏はさまざまな問題が生じても、たいてい従業員の信頼をつなぎ留めて結果を残している。一方で「経営者の99.9％」はマスク氏ほど多くの貢献を従業員に求めることはできないとシュローター氏は結論する。",businessinsider

New life from April. You should be fully prepared for online meetings and online classes held at new companies, new jobs, or university classes.

This time, we set a budget of 15,000 yen in order to easily adjust the environment around your PC. We will introduce three products: external cameras, headphones, and USB hubs.

""BRIO 100"" external camera with full HD compatible physical shutter

BRIO 100 Manufacturer: Logitech Release date: October 2023 Direct sales price: 4,950 yen (tax included)

First, an external camera that shows your face during an online meeting.

Most modern laptops have built-in cameras, but unless you have the latest laptops, you'd like to have an external camera because of the advantages of high resolution and the ability to fine-tune the image using dedicated software.

Among the various cameras, the best cost-effective one is Logitech's ""BRIO 100,"" which offers a wide range of PC peripherals.

It measures 31.91 x 72.91 x 66.64 mm, and the camera alone weighs 75 g (nominal). Its light and simple appearance makes it easy to attach to a laptop or external display.

The resolution is up to 1080p/30fps, making it a good performance for an introductory external camera. During times of use, you can hide the lens with the physical shutter provided, so you can feel safer in terms of privacy.

Additionally, using the Logi Options+ app, you can change detailed settings such as exposure, white balance, brightness, contrast, and saturation. You can control it simply by moving the slider, so even beginners can set it without too much hesitation.

The BRIO 100 also has a unidirectional microphone, and the sound collection range is up to 1m. This may be useful if you do not use an external microphone or earphones.

""Soundcore Q11i"" headphones that can be connected simultaneously with PCs and smartphones

Soundcore Q11i Manufacturer: Anchor Release date: February 2025 Direct sales price: 5,990 yen (tax included)

We will introduce the Anker wireless headphones, the Soundcore Q11i, as a device that plays audio during online meetings and uses them as microphones.

The main body weighs approximately 241g (nominal value) and the headband is relatively thick. The ear pads and head pads are made of quite soft materials.

As I felt, I didn't feel much pain when I put it on over my glasses.

In addition to the power button, the side of the unit also has a volume adjustment button, allowing you to adjust the volume without touching the PC.

The playback time when connected wirelessly is long, at a maximum of 60 hours, so there is no need to charge it frequently. The charging terminal is a USB-C.

It also supports wired connections. Photo: Sato Fumihiko

The Soundcore Q11i supports a ""multipoint function"" that allows you to connect two devices at the same time, so we recommend this in business situations. It's convenient to use it by connecting it to a PC for online meetings and connecting it to your smartphone so you can always take a phone call.

It also has a wind noise reduction microphone, allowing for clear voice calls.

In addition to wireless connection via Bluetooth, it also supports wired connections using the included AUX cable, but be careful as button operations and the built-in microphone cannot be used when connecting priority.",businessinsider

If good things go too far, it becomes harmful. This seems to apply to ChatGPT as well. The OpenAI and MIT research shows this.

It is said that increasing addiction for general purposes such as advice, explanations, and ideas can lead to addiction.

The study points out that frequent use of ChatGPT may lead to ""loss of autonomy and confidence in one's decisions.""

Benjamin Disraeli, who served as British Prime Minister in the late 19th century, was known as a man who called for the importance of ""moderateness,"" and is said to have stated that this was the ""center of human philosophy and divine philosophy.""

Having made great achievements in politics and literature, Disraeli probably had no idea how AI would shape the world. However, he may have understood this meaning better than anyone in modern times.

MIT Media Lab, in collaboration with OpenAI, conducted a four-week survey of approximately 1,000 people on how to use ChatGPT. A report published on March 21, 2025 revealed that people who overuse the technology could have a negative impact on their self-awareness.

Typical usage patterns for ChatGPT include obtaining advice, requesting conceptual explanations, and helping with ideas creation and brainstorming. It has been confirmed that users who overuse ChatGPT for these impersonal conversations may have increased emotional dependency.

There was also a tendency for these users to fall into ""problematic use."" The researchers defined this as ""addictive behavior or obsessive use that has negative consequences for physical and psychosocial well-being.""

Furthermore, these users saw ChatGPT as a ""friend"" from the beginning, gained high confidence, and felt that their feelings could affect ChatGPT or cause concern.

The authors of the report cited future research topics such as ""whether this could lead to 'cognitive dependence'."" In other words, it is necessary to examine the process in which users become more dependent on AI systems in decision-making and problem-solving than emotional support, and ultimately lose confidence in self-determination and decision-making.

The bedroom, where you spend the last part of the day, is an important place to reset your body and mind. If it's messy or full of everyday life, stress can accumulate unconsciously and have a negative effect on the quality of your sleep. For business people, creating a bedroom environment is a must-have point, especially as the quality of sleep is directly linked to daytime performance.

This time, we asked Toyota Miho, an interior designer who coordinates private homes and offices at Social Interior Co., Ltd. about tips for maintaining an ideal bedroom.

1. Simplify your bed making

The most effective way to keep your ideal bedroom is to make your bed a habit. However, for busy business people, it is likely that it is a high hurdle to properly organize their beds every morning. So, what Toyota suggests is making a bed that can be done in a time-saving way.

""Bed sheets that are wrinkle-resistant and duvet covers that are easy to install can significantly reduce the hassle of making your bed in the morning. We especially recommend using bedding made of stretchy fabrics, such as Nitori's N-Fit series. They are easy to tidy up and look beautiful, so you can make your bed in a short amount of time even on busy mornings.""

Toyota also asks you to be careful about the arrangement of the beds.

""If you attach the bed to the wall perfectly, it can only be adjusted from one side, which can make your bed everyday. If the size is single or larger, it is also important to have enough space to pass by people near the wall.""

2. Avoid using under-bed storage as much as possible

As I became a Costco member at the end of 2021, I quickly realized that I wasn't suited to him.

Not only did ""bulk purchases"" save money, it also inspired my worst shopping habits.

In the end I was overwhelmed by the ""over-buying"".

When I first followed a friend who was going to Costco, I was completely captivated and immediately signed up for membership after paying.

However, it didn't take long to realize that Costco was not suitable for me as a two-person living. It's not that they didn't like the product range and the quality of the products. In fact, I love Costco products and have very few complaints.

The membership-based system and ""bulk-buying"" has inspired my worst shopping habits.

Impulse buying never stops

At first, I was able to ""buy in bulk"" so I was able to plan ahead and stock up on daily necessities such as consumables and toilet paper.

However, when you want to try out a new product, you need to be prepared to satisfy your curiosity. Costco sells large or big sizes, so you'll need money and space than buying at a typical grocery supermarket.

As a result, I often picked up the item thinking, ""I wish there was,"" but ended up not using it. It took months to use up the bottled capers I bought at Costco, and I didn't even have a handy hand on the packed canned tomatoes for nearly a year.

It's easier to waste food and money

When I open the fridge or pantry, I don't immediately find what I'm looking for, so I'm the type of person who forgets that it's there. This is not a good trend for ""buying in bulk"" at Costco.

It wasn't a big problem if it could be stored for a long time, but even so, I felt stressed when I bought another thing I had at home, such as trail mixes, garbage bags, and wet tissues.

On the other hand, it was common for people to ruin refrigerated or frozen ingredients, such as vegetables for salads and large-capacity chicken thighs, to ruin them before they could eat them, or they would freeze them.

Of course, it's not Costco's fault either. However, in my case, I have been wasting more ingredients and money than before I became a Costco member.",businessinsider

Americans' happiness is at an all-time low, with the main reason being that the well-being of young people under the age of 30 is declining.

A recent study has shown that there is a correlation between eating with someone and individual well-being.

This is not the first report that focuses on ""unfulfillment"" among younger people, particularly Gen Z Americans.

Young Americans are increasingly eating alone. This seems to be decreasing happiness.

The World Happiness Report, which ranks the happiness levels of countries around the world, was released on March 20, 2025. According to the results, the more countries where people have more opportunities to eat with someone, the more people feel that they are socially supported and the less lonely they feel. In this happiness ranking, the United States dropped further from 23rd place last year, ranking 24th out of 147 countries, hitting a record low.

""The decline in the happiness rankings in America are primarily due to a sudden decline in well-being (physical and physical health and happiness) among Americans under the age of 30,"" the report points out. The report was researched and prepared by the Wellbeing Research Centre at Oxford University in collaboration with Gallup, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (UN SDSN), and an editorial committee made up of external experts.

It also states that ""now young people in North America and Western Europe exhibit the lowest well-being of all generations.""

Around the world, there is a strong correlation between ""the number of times you eat with someone"" and ""well-being.""

""The more people eat together, the more people have a higher level of social support and good mutual aid, and the less loneliness exists."" It has also been revealed that ""meals together"" are an indicator that clearly shows a person's well-being, just like employment and income.

Dining alone is becoming more common in all age groups, but especially among younger Americans. In the 2023 survey, over 25% of young people aged 18 to 24 said they had eaten all their meals alone the day before the survey. Additionally, age groups ages 55 to 64 and 65 and older reported that they consumed more meals on their own than the youngest age group.

Furthermore, 2023 data from the American Time Use Survey cited in the report shows that one in four Americans reported eating all their daily meals alone, indicating a 53% increase since 2003.

This is not the first report that focuses on the ""unfulfillment"" of young Americans, especially Gen Z (ages 13-28). Gen Z suffers from high living costs as they build their careers, and they have more credit card debt than they were when millennials were younger. Furthermore, he finds no purpose in his work and feels that he is always rejected.",businessinsider

トランプ大統領とFRBとの関係は複雑だ。

FRBと政治は一線を画すとされているが、トランプ大統領は躊躇せず中央銀行の政策に対する自分の意見を述べてきた。絶えず利下げを求めてきたため、トランプ氏が金融政策への影響を強め、FRBの独立性低下を意図しているとの懸念が高まっている。

3月18、19日の両日に開かれたFOMCで、2025年のインフレ率の上昇と経済成長率の低下が争点となった。FRBが金利据え置きを決定した後、トランプ大統領との緊張が高まっている。トランプ大統領の政策と金融政策への介入を何とか回避したいFRBとの綱引きが続く。

Advertisement

そこで、トランプ大統領とFRBの関係について知っておきたいことを5つ挙げておこう。

1. トランプはFRBの最近の金利判断を快く思っていない

3月19日にトランプ大統領は、FRBの政策判断への不満をあらわにした。トランプ氏はFOMCが終了してから数時間後に、自身のSNSであるトゥルース・ソーシャル（Truth Social）でFRBに利下げを求めた。

「米国の関税が経済に影響し始めているときに、FRBは利下げした方がはるかに良かった。正しいことをしよう」とSNSに投稿した。

2. トランプがFRBに圧力をかけるのは初めてではない

トランプ氏が金融政策に圧力をかけるのは、これが初めてではない。

年初開かれた世界経済フォーラム（WEF）での講演で、「今すぐ金利を下げるよう」要請するつもりだと発言した。

3月時点の経済予測 実質GDPの変化 コアインフレ率

昨年、トランプ氏によるFRBの政策判断への影響を強める計画を盟友が立てていると報じられると、FRBの独立性について懸念が高まった。

第1次トランプ政権下でパウエル氏をFRB議長に指名したトランプ氏だが、金融政策では長年パウエル氏と衝突してきた。第1次トランプ政権時代には、パウエル議長はアメリカの「敵」ではないかとX（旧ツイッター）で疑問を提起し、報道によると、大統領法律顧問にパウエル議長を理事に格下げできないか検討するよう指示した。

3. FRBが屈する可能性は低い

FRBが短期的に利下げする兆候はみられない。3月の経済予測では、FOMC参加者の大半がインフレリスクの上振れを懸念していることが示された。

「3月のFOMC会合で金利が据え置かれたことに驚きはない。今後の関税の影響を見極めており、FOMCは政治的混乱の中にある。だが、インフレは鎮静化し6月のFOMCでは利下げに踏み切ると引き続き予想する」とLPLファイナンシャルのチーフ・エコノミスト、ジェフリー・ローチ（Jeffrey Roach）氏はレポートで述べている。

FRBは以前もトランプ氏の要求を拒否しており、投資家は今回も同様と考えている。

CMEのFebWatchツールによると、市場は次回5月のFOMCでの金利据え置き確率を79%、6月の会合で25bp以上の利下げが行われる確率を76%とみている。

4. トランプ関税でインフレが再燃しているとFRBは見ている

会合後の記者会見でパウエル議長は、最近のインフレ圧力の高まりはトランプ大統領の関税計画が一因であると述べた。ただし、関税がどの程度インフレ率を押し上げているのか正確に把握することは難しい、とも付け加えた。（物価上昇の）かなりの部分が関税によるのは明らかだが、その影響は短期間で収束する可能性があると指摘した。

「経済見通しの不確実性が高まったとの認識が声明に加わったのは見逃せない。FRBは政治的議論に直接関与することを避けながら、関税リスクを強調したようだ」と資産運用会社グレンミード（Glenmede）の投資戦略・リサーチ責任者であるジェイソン・プライド氏は述べた。

最新の経済予測によると、FRBは2027年にインフレ率が再び2%に低下すると予想する。

だが、トランプ氏は貿易戦争を推し進める意向を示唆する。トランプ政権は4月2日に相互関税を発動する予定であり、その日は「米国の開放の日」とトゥルース・ソーシャルに投稿した。

5. 金利はトランプ政権の重要な指標である

第 1次トランプ政権では株式市場を通知表としてきたが、今回は違う指標に注目しているようだ。

住宅ローンなどあらゆる融資商品の重要な貸出指標である米10年国債利回りがそれだ。

トランプ政権は市場のボラティリティ（変動率）は許容できると示唆する一方で、ベッセント財務長官は借入金利を下げるために、米10年国債利回りを抑えることが最終的な目標であるとのトランプ氏の見解を繰り返し述べている。

年初にベッセント財務長官はフォックス・ビジネスで、「トランプ氏と私は米10年国債とその利回りを注視している。トランプ氏は金利低下を望んでいるが、FRBに利下げを要求してはいない」と述べている。

3月20日の米10年国債利回りは、3ベーシス・ポイント（bp）低下して4.22%となった。これは、関税発動懸念とインフレ上昇期待が高まる中、年初に債券相場が急落し金利が4.80%のピークをつけたときから60bp以上低い水準である。",businessinsider

Analyst Edison Yu reiterated his buy rating on the electric vehicle maker but slashed his price target to $345 from $420. His revised forecast is now 26% above where shares closed Thursday. Yu noted he sees first-quarter deliveries ranging between 340,000 and 350,000, below a sell-side consensus of 378,000. This would represent an 11% year over year loss and a 30% quarter-over-quarter decline, as well as the lowest level since the third quarter of 2022. This also ""likely means auto margin will also be under greater pressure,"" he said. Tesla has seen a contentious year, with the stock giving up much of its postelection gain. Shares of Tesla have gained nearly 10% week to date, but are still down 32% on the year. TSLA 1Y mountain TSLA 1Y chart ""Our view is that Tesla's stock has been under pressure recently driven by much weaker auto volumes, broader de-rating in growth assets (e.g., Mag 7), and to some extent, political/policy uncertainty,"" Yu wrote. ""As we have seen over the years, rarely anything at Tesla happens in a straight line and we would not expect robotaxi or humanoid to be linear."" Yu also said some ""brand damage"" caused by Musk's political activities could hurt demand, which is something he will continue to monitor going forward. On the bright side, the company is in a good position to hedge against President Donald Trump's intention to levy a 25% auto tariff on ""all cars that are not made in the United States."" ""While the new 25% tariffs can hurt Tesla, mainly on the Mexico content (20-25% depending on the model), we estimate very minimal impact under the current guidelines (powertrain, electronic components) given Tesla likely sources mostly low value-add items from there,"" the analyst added.

https://cnbc.com,"Core inflation in February hits 2.8%, higher than expected; spending increases 0.4%",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/pce-inflation-february-2025-.html,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","The Federal Reserve's key inflation measure rose more than expected in February while consumer spending also posted a smaller-than-projected increase, the Commerce Department reported Friday.

The core personal consumption expenditures price index showed a 0.4% increase for the month, the biggest monthly gain since January 2024, putting the 12-month inflation rate at 2.8%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for respective numbers of 0.3% and and 2.7%.

Core inflation excludes volatile food and energy prices and is generally considered a better indicator of long-term inflation trends.

In the all-items measure, the price index rose 0.3% on the month and 2.5% from a year ago, both in line with forecasts.

At the same time, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed that consumer spending accelerated 0.4% for the month, below the 0.5% forecast. That came as personal income posted a 0.8% rise, against the estimate for 0.4%.

Stock market futures briefly moved lower following the release, as did Treasury yields.

Federal Reserve officials focus on the PCE inflation reading as they consider it a broader measure that also adjusts for changes in consumer behavior and places less of an emphasis on housing than the Labor Department's consumer price index. Shelter costs have been one of the stickier elements of inflation and rose 0.3% in the PCE measure.

""It looks like a 'wait-and-see' Fed still has more waiting to do,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. ""Today's higher-than-expected inflation reading wasn't exceptionally hot, but it isn't going to speed up the Fed's timeline for cutting interest rates, especially given the uncertainty surrounding tariffs.""

Good prices increased 0.2%, led by recreational goods and vehicles, which increased 0.5%. Gasoline offset some of the increase, with the category falling 0.8%. Services prices were up 0.4%.

Households also grew more cautious with their money, as the personal saving rate increased to 4.6%, the highest since June 2024.

The report comes with markets on edge that President Donald Trump's tariff intentions will aggravate inflation at a time when the data was making slow but steady progress back to the Fed's 2% goal.

After cutting rates a full percentage point in 2024, the central bank has been on hold this year, with officials of late expressing concern over the effect the import duties will have on prices. Economists tend to consider tariffs as one-off events that do not feed through to longer-lasting inflation pressures, but the encompassing scope of Trump's tariffs and the potential for an aggressive global trade war are changing the stakes.

Correction: Consumer spending increased 0.4% in February. An earlier headline misstated the number.

Bangkok authorities declared the Thai capital a ""disaster area"" on Friday, after a powerful earthquake in neighboring Myanmar created tremors which caused buildings to sway dramatically and one skyscraper under construction to collapse. Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt said the worst damage was to a 33-storey building that was being built in Chatuchak district. Sittipunt said 83 construction workers had been trapped inside. In an update shared to social media at 10 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET), the Bangkok Incident Command Center said 10 people had died. Footage of the building rapidly crumbling showed residents and tourists in the area running in panic. ""At present, the earthquake may still result in aftershocks, prompting Bangkok authorities to urgently assess damaged areas, monitor at-risk zones, and provide assistance to affected residents, as well as address any ongoing dangers that may pose risks to public safety,"" Bangkok City Hall said in a Google-translated statement. In Myanmar — where the ruling military junta has declared a state of emergency — at least 144 people were reported dead and 732 injured, according to Reuters, which cited a Friday evening update on state television. Myanmar's junta chief reportedly said there would be ""many more"" deaths and casualties"" and that routes for international assistance had been opened.

Cracked buildings and bridges in Bangkok were being inspected by engineers for their stability on Friday, though authorities advised that people could return to buildings without severe damage. As the city's notoriously-bad traffic reached severe levels entering Friday evening, with some major highway exits closed, authorities said four main parks would remain open providing water and toilet trucks.

Thai stock exchange closed, offices evacuated

The Stock Exchange of Thailand suspended trading across all exchanges from Friday afternoon from 2:07 p.m. local time, while several Bangkok shopping malls were shuttered for the remainder of Friday and the BTS metro system was closed. Offices across the skyscraper-dense city were meanwhile evacuated on Friday afternoon. Finance worker Bell Satirapraparkul told CNBC she was having lunch in the ground floor restaurant of her office in the Ratchayothin neighborhood in the north of Bangkok when she felt heavy shaking. Employees were barred from the site until Saturday at the earliest without being able to collect their cars. Several tall buildings could be seen swaying severely as water from rooftop pools poured over the side and items were thrown off. Automaker Nissan told CNBC it had paused its manufacturing operations in Thailand until the situation was assessed as safe by Thai authorities. ""Nissan put employees' safety as a priority. As of now, we have confirmed that all employees at Nissan Thailand are safe and evacuated. We are checking if there are damages to our facilities,"" a spokesperson said. Bangkok's hospitals were reported safe and operating as normal.

https://cnbc.com,Nvidia-backed CoreWeave closes flat at $40 after biggest U.S. tech IPO since 2021,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/coreweave-starts-trading-on-nasdaq-at-per-share.html,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Michael Intrator, Founder & CEO of CoreWeave, Inc., Nvidia-backed cloud services provider, gestures during the company's IPO at the Nasdaq Market, in New York City, U.S., March 28, 2025.

CoreWeave's stock opened at $39 and closed at $40 in its Nasdaq debut on Friday after the company sold shares at $40 a piece, below the expected range.

The seller of artificial intelligence technology in the cloud raised $1.5 billion in its share sale, the biggest tech IPO in the U.S. since 2021.

The offering has captured the attention of investors from Wall Street to Silicon Valley, as CoreWeave represents the first pure-play AI IPO and the largest tech debut in the U.S. in four years. The IPO market has been largely shut since the end of 2021, as the tech industry reckoned with rising inflation and interest rates.

Tech stocks aren't doing CoreWeave any favors. The company hit the market on a day that the Nasdaq was off by almost 3%, heading for its worst quarterly performance since mid-2022. The tech-heavy index is down 10% so far this year.

As a supplier to OpenAI, CoreWeave is among the beneficiaries of the generative AI boom that began with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Microsoft , which provides cloud services to OpenAI, is CoreWeave's biggest customer, accounting for 62% of the company's $1.92 billion in revenue last year.

CoreWeave rents out access to hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units to other large tech and AI companies including Meta , IBM and Cohere. Its stiffest competition is coming from the top cloud vendors — Microsoft, Amazon , Google and Oracle .

CoreWeave reported a net loss of $863 million last year, with revenue soaring 737% from a year earlier. It's a capital-intensive business due to the high costs of renting out and operating data centers. CoreWeave has raised almost $13 billion in debt, with much of that allocated for GPUs that go inside the company's leased facilities in the U.S. and abroad.

After initially setting its price target at $47 to $55, with a plan to raise about $2.5 billion at the middle of the range, CoreWeave slimmed down the offering, a reflection of investor skepticism.

""There's a lot of headwinds in the macro,"" CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday. ""And we definitely had to scale or rightsize the transaction for where the buying interest was.""

Few tech companies have debuted on U.S. exchanges in recent years. There were just 13 venture-backed technology IPOs in 2022, 2023 and 2024 combined, compared with 77 in the record year of 2021, according to data from Jay Ritter, an emeritus professor of finance at the University of Florida.",cnbc

It wasn't supposed to go down like this.

The Trump presidency was set to usher in a rush of money to the markets, spurred by a new era of deregulation and lower taxes that would lead high-valued tech companies off the sidelines and onto public exchanges after a four-year lull in initial public offerings.

Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in January that he sensed a ""more constructive kind of optimism"" and that the IPO market is ""going to pick up.""

But a little over two months into President Donald Trump's second White House term, the first test case has been a flop.

After downsizing its IPO late Thursday and pricing below its expected range, CoreWeave was unchanged in its market debut on Friday, closing at $40 and leaving the company with a market cap that's right around where the company was valued by private investors a year ago.

The debut coincided with a 2.7% drop in the Nasdaq on Friday, a decline that put the tech-heavy index down more than 10% in 2025 and on pace ofr its worst quarterly performance since mid-2022.

Macro concerns are being driven by President Trump's tariffs on America's top trading partners and dramatic government cost cuts, moves that are combining to simultaneously raise prices and lift unemployment. The deterioration in consumer sentiment was even worse than anticipated in March as worries over inflation intensified, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday.

That all created a tough backdrop for CoreWeave to try and crack open the IPO market, particularly given concerns swirling around the company and its valuation. CoreWeave is one of the leading suppliers of Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, for artificial intelligence training and workloads. Demand has been so hot that CoreWeave's revenue soared more than 700% last year to almost $2 billion.

Charlie Javice, founder of a startup purchased by JPMorgan Chase in 2021, was convicted in federal court Friday of defrauding the bank by vastly overstating the company's customer list.

The jury decision comes after weeks of testimony in New York over who was to blame for the flameout of a once-promising startup. Frank, founded by Javice in 2016, aimed to help users apply for college financial aid.

JPMorgan has accused Javice, 32, of duping the bank into paying $175 million for a company that had more than 4 million customers, when in reality it had fewer than 300,000.

The largest U.S. bank by assets sued Javice in late 2022 after attempting to send marketing emails to some of the thousands of ""customers"" it thought Frank had. In its suit, JPMorgan released emails in which Javice hired a data scientist to generate a fake roster of customers.

Then, in April 2023, the Justice Department charged Javice with four crimes including wire and bank fraud, counts which carry multi-decade maximum sentences. Javice was arrested at Newark Airport on April 3 of that year and had been out on bail.

Javice had pleaded not guilty and said she was innocent throughout the trial; her lawyers blamed JPMorgan for rushing to close the Frank acquisition because it feared that other suitors would emerge.

In fact, it was the biggest U.S. tech IPO since 2021. The cloud services provider – which has navigated a challenging path to its IPO – is being viewed as a barometer of future Wall Street dealmaking and the investment banks that profit from them. The news CoreWeave shares opened at $39 each early Friday afternoon — debuting short of their offer price. The stock sank further before rallying in late afternoon trading. The New Jersey-based company, which provides big tech customers access to Nvidia chips for AI training and workloads, priced a scaled-back 37.5 million shares at $40 each Thursday evening — below the initial expected range of between $47 and $55. Still, CoreWeave managed to raise $1.5 billion. Based on Friday's trading, its market capitalization was more than $19 billion. In response to the size and pricing adjustments, CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator cited ""headwinds in the macro"" environment. During an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday morning, Intrator said the company ""definitely had to scale or rightsize the transaction for where the buying interest was."" He added, ""We believe that as the public markets get to know us, get to know how we execute, get to know how we build our infrastructure, get to know how we build our client relationships and the incredible capacity of our solutions, the company will be very successful."" Big picture The CoreWeave IPO comes as Wall Street's largest financial firms are banking on a pickup in deals following years of muted public offerings and mergers due to high interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty. The market expected deal activity to pick up — and for investment banks, like Club name Goldman Sachs , to see fatter fees — after Donald Trump won the presidential election on promises of robust economic growth and deregulation. The deals and proceeds have increased in 2025, but not as much as hoped due to the stock market's recent volatility. In the first quarter, according to IPO-tracker Renaissance Capital, 44 offerings have raised a combined $9.4 billion. That's up from 30 IPOs and a combined $7.8 billion raised in the year-ago period. ""A strong start was cut off by a market correction near quarter-end,"" Renaissance Capital said in a report this week. Trump's near-daily tariff headlines are increasing concerns of a recession and an all-out global trade war. That's made companies want to conserve capital and stay on the sidelines when it comes to new deals. Case in point: Jefferies posted lackluster first-quarter earnings results Wednesday as profits declined on investment banking weakness. Jefferies CEO Rich Handler said, ""Capital markets have become increasingly more challenging due to the uncertainties that have arisen around U.S. policy and geopolitical events."" There are still reasons to be optimistic, though. Online lender Klarna and physical therapy company Hinge Health have both filed prospectuses shortly after CoreWeave did. There have also been recent reports that the popular chat app Discord tapped Goldman Sachs and other large banks for a planned IPO as well, according to Bloomberg. Goldman, along with Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan , were the lead underwriters of the CoreWeave offering. GS YTD mountain Goldman Sachs (GS) year-to-date performance Bottom line There's no doubt about it: CoreWeave's public debut will send a signal to investors about the outlook for the IPO market. ""This was the one that's supposed to open the floodgates [for deals],"" Jim Cramer said Friday. More deals are essential in our investment case for Goldman – which we bought more of last week. We initiated a position in the Wall Street behemoth last year on the premise that it's the best pure-play for an investment banking rebound. CoreWeave is ""certainly going to be a test. Not only for demand for AI stocks but also the IPO market at large,"" Jeff Marks, the Club's director of portfolio analysis, said Friday. ""That's crucial for Goldman."" We recognize that the IB resurgence hasn't materialized yet in 2025. But we're not giving up hope on Goldman ahead of its quarterly earnings next month. Trading volumes have been strong, given the stock market's recent volatility, which could offset some IB revenue weakness. Plus, it seems like uncertainty around dealmaking has been priced into Goldman's stock already. Shares are down 19% from record highs last month. The stock was also 5% lower year-to-date, in line with the S & P 500's dismal performance. Getting past April 2 –the looming deadline for Trump's wide-ranging reciprocal tariffs – will be helpful for Goldman's IB business as well. ""There should be more clarity after April 2,"" Marks said.

Longevity is one of three ""transformational innovation opportunities"" that will drive equity markets in the next decade, a team of strategists said in a note Wednesday. The other two are artificial intelligence and power and resources. ""The combination of ever-increasing lifespans and a demographic shift toward an older population creates a range of investment opportunities,"" the UBS strategists wrote. One area that is already established in the space is retirement living, which is growing at a 4% compound annual growth rate until 2030, they said. The oldest baby boomers are rapidly approaching their 80th birthday and that is going to increase demand for senior housing options, such as independent living, assisted living and nursing homes. The National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care predicts that 200,000 additional senior housing units will be needed in 2025, an additional 500,000 units by 2028 and another 775,000 units by 2030.

Ventas , whose portfolio includes senior housing communities, skilled nursing facilities and medical office buildings, has a 2.8% dividend yield.

""The increase in occupancy is leading to stronger pricing power and margin improvement,"" Woloshin said.

Shares are up about 16% year to date. Welltower also has a diversified portfolio. The company boasts more than 1,500 senior housing, post-acute communities and outpatient medical properties in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. It pays a dividend yield of about 1.8%. ""WELL has a strong senior housing portfolio located in a number of high-barrier-to-entry markets, something that continues to benefit the company in a post- COVID-19 world,"" UBS analyst Thomas Parmentier wrote.

WELL YTD mountain Welltower The stock, which is up 21% so far this year, is trading at a ""significant premium valuation"" to its peers, he pointed out.

President Donald Trump has granted pardons to three co-founders of the BitMEX global cryptocurrency exchange, CNBC has learned.

The co-founders, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed, previously pled guilty to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act related to failure to maintain anti-money laundering and know-your-customer programs.

The trio received criminal sentences of probation and were ordered to pay civil fines totaling $30 million related to a lawsuit by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Prosecutors accused the men of effectively operating BitMEX as a ""money laundering platform"" and that its purported withdrawal from the U.S. market was ""a sham.""

Trump issued the pardons on Thursday, more than three months after BitMEX was sentenced to pay a fine of $100 million for violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to establish and maintain anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer programs.

Delo, in a statement, said, ""The US Department of Justice wrongfully targeted BitMEX and its co-founders.""

""This full and unconditional pardon by President Trump is a vindication of the position we have always held – that BitMEX, my co-founders and I should never have been charged with a criminal offense through an obscure, antiquated law,"" Delo said.

""As the most successful crypto exchange of its kind, we were wrongfully made to serve as an example, sacrificed for political reasons and used to send inconsistent regulatory signals.""

""I'm sincerely grateful to the President for granting this pardon to me and my co-founders,"" Delo said. ""A legal wrong has been righted today and despite the distress I have been through over the past few years I'm pleased to have cleared my name and to be able to continue my life and philanthropic work without the burden of an unfounded conviction.""

Hayes, Delo and Reed founded BitMEX in 2014. Prosecutors said the executives knew that the exchange was required to implement an anti-money laundering plan because it served U.S. customers ""but chose to flout those requirements, requiring only that customers provide an email address to use BitMEX's services.""

""Indeed, senior executives each knew that customers residing in the U.S. continued to access BitMEX's trading platform through at least in or about 2018, and that BitMEX policies nominally in place to prevent such trading were toothless or easily overridden to serve BitMEX's bottom line goal of obtaining revenue through the U.S. market without regard to U.S. criminal laws,"" the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement in January.

Delo, the former chief operating officer and chief strategy officer of BitMEX, had been sentenced to 30 months of probation after his guilty plea in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

Hayes was sentenced to six months of home confinement, followed by two years of probation.

Reed, who is the exchange's former chief technology officer, was sentenced to 18 months of probation.

Trevor Milton, the founder and former CEO of electric truck maker Nikola, revealed Thursday night that Trump had pardoned him for his criminal conviction for securities fraud. Milton had been sentenced to four years in prison in that case, but remained free on appeal.",cnbc

Market update: Stocks are closing out the week on an ugly note. The market got a double dose of bad economic news earlier after the Fed's preferred inflation gauge — the PCE price index — remained stubbornly elevated while University of Michigan consumer sentiment continued to slide. Also, a lack of enthusiasm for CoreWeave , the largest tech IPO since 2021, may have added to the market's angst about AI-related stocks. Shares of this AI cloud services provider opened $1 below its IPO price of $40 but that's terrible when you consider the Nasdaq is off nearly 3% in the session. This and that: Bloomberg reported Friday that the Panama Canal ports sale from CK Hutchison to a BlackRock-led consortium could be delayed past the expected completed date of April 2. Political reasons may be getting in the way, after China criticized the deal and CK's senior advisor Li Ka-shing. It's something to monitor in the weeks ahead. Following Friday's economic data and market uneasiness over tariffs, the probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Fed's June Meeting increased to about 76% from 66% the day before, according to CME Fed Watch. Up next: The market's focus next week will be on tariffs and economic data. On Wednesday, the Trump Administration is expected to impose reciprocal tariffs against countries that have a trade imbalance with the United States. There's still a lot of uncertainty about the size and scope of these tariffs and which, if any, industries will be exempted. The market could benefit by gaining some clarity on tariffs, but the uncertain impact they have on the economy and inflation remains a significant overhang. On the data side, it's job week which means on Friday we'll see the March nonfarm payroll report. The current expectation is that the economy added 140,000 jobs in the month with an unchanged unemployment rate of 4.1%. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

The stock market has been on a wild ride in 2025, as a ream of policy changes from the White House has left investors confused as to what to buy or sell. By the end of trading on Monday, when the quarter ends, the S & P 500 will have managed to dip into correction territory — just 22 days after reaching all-time highs — before recouping some of its losses. The broader market index was last more than 9% off its peak and posted its fifth weekly decline in six weeks. Market observers expect that any sort of finality that comes April 2 will give the stock market enough of the certainty it needs for a short-term boost. That said, many worry there will be no forthcoming resolution. What's more, they fear the severity of tariffs, as well as any of the economic repercussions, could remain a long-term overhang for equities. ""If you don't get much more tariff actions, and there's some resolution of uncertainty, you could see a bit of a temporary relief rally,"" said Brett Ryan, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. ""But I think that there's going to be selling into it, because unless you're backing down from tariffs, this is a negative, no matter what."" The stakes are heightened as tariffs are just one piece of a larger economic picture that is becoming more grim as of late, especially with the federal budget deadline also looming next month. While household balance sheets remain strong, weakening consumer sentiment has investors fearful the U.S. is headed for a slowdown, at a minimum, and a recession, at worst. ""The probability of a recession almost certainly has gone up,"" said Chris Marangi, co-CIO of value at Gabelli Funds. ""I'm not sure that's been fully reflected yet in prices."" How severe will tariffs be? Perhaps most important for investors will be what results of the tariff threats against Mexico and Canada, which have raised eyebrows as the USMCA trade agreement between the three major trading partners was brokered during the first Trump administration. A diminishing of trade relations would have far-reaching consequences for all three countries and add to fears that the current Trump administration sees tariffs more as a revenue-raising tool than one to negotiate a better deal. ""My worst fear would be that there is no intention to renegotiate the USMCA, or to improve it,"" Deutsche Bank Securities' Ryan said. ""The worst fear is that their intention is actually to have no more USMCA."" The severity of the tariffs could also determine the outlook for both the economy and the market. The Tax Foundation estimates the average tariff rate for all imports will rise to 8.4% in 2025, from 2.5% in 2024. That would be the highest average rate going back to 1946. Ryan expects the current tariff rate is higher, at 10.5%, and thinks it could go over 16% if the Trump administration takes a maximalist approach to trade. That would bring the tariff rate close to Depression-era levels, he said, to 1938. That could further weaken the growth outlook, and raise inflation expectations, at a time when fears of stagflation are percolating on Wall Street. ""All of this is negative, okay?"" said Ryan. ""None of this is positive."" More fear than greed The on-again-off-again nature of recent tariff announcements is important in part because neither consumers nor corporations can plan for the future. Neither can investors. Some on the Street such as Fundstrat's Tom Lee think stocks can stage a comeback rally following April 2, with the Magnificent Seven stocks possibly resuming their former leadership. Last week, 3Fourteen's Warren Pies said it may be worthwhile for investors who have an underweight equity exposure to bring it up to equal weight, to start taking an "" offensive mindset "" in April. But plenty of others are positioning themselves defensively ahead of the announcement. Fixed income is becoming more attractive, along with gold and other alternative assets. By itself, gold has soared past $3,000 an ounce, on Friday notching its 18th record high of 2025 amid concerns of a global trade war. Meanwhile, confidence in the bull case for U.S. equities is taking a hit . This week, an online survey conducted by Allianz Life Insurance found that 51% of respondents ""worry that another big market crash is on the horizon,"" up from 46% previously. On Friday, Bank of America Securities' Savita Subramanian said ""new US equity bear cases [are] emerging,"" citing, among other things, ""policy uncertainty amid higher government debt."" Among big firms, Barclays' strategist Venu Krishna is the latest to cut his 2025 S & P 500 target to 5,900 from 6,600 , meaning little to no upside from where the benchmark started the year. His is also the lowest outlook among those in a CNBC Pro market strategist survey. Gabelli Funds' Marangi outlined the criteria for finding buying opportunities in this environment: ""We're obviously trying to gauge how aggressive to be in deploying capital, and trying to find companies that are relatively immune to what may be going on, or trying to find companies that maybe have overreacted to some of the news that comes out of Washington."" Elsewhere, at a recent media roundtable, Connor Fitzgerald, fixed income portfolio manager at Wellington Management, put it succinctly when he was asked to take a view on equities: ""Yeah. I don't love stocks right now."" Week ahead calendar All times ET.

https://cnbc.com,'Dollar dominance' is under pressure. Here's what it means for the U.S.,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/dollar-dominance-is-under-pressure-heres-what-it-means-for-the-us.html,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","The U.S. dollar has been key to the global financial community in the years following World War II, but there are rising headwinds to the greenback's standing – and serious risks to the U.S. economy and businesses if it were to lose its reserve currency status. The BRICS countries, which include Russia and China, have been pursuing strategies to reduce dollar-facilitated transactions by conducting more trade settlements in their own countries. They've also been working on a digital payment platform known as the BRICS Bridge. The development has caught the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened tariffs of 100% on the nations in November and again in January. ""We are going to require a commitment from these seemingly hostile Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs,"" he said in a Jan. 30 post on Truth Social. The BRICS Bridge isn't the only effort being made to reduce reliance on the dollar: China has tried to internationalize the renminbi, which rose to 3.8% of global and international payments within the SWIFT interbank payment processor in late 2024 — overtaking the yen. Beijing has also created the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System to rival SWIFT. CIPS managed to notch $15 trillion in transactions in 2023, according to the Institute of International Finance. Though none of these efforts appear immediately poised to replace the dollar — the greenback still accounts for roughly half of all international transactions, according to the IIF — rising trade tensions are threatening the perceived safety and stability that support dollar dominance. This is leading some investors to wonder whether ""de-dollarization"" might gain more traction. ""​​We do not write this lightly. But the speed and scale of global shifts is so rapid that this needs to be acknowledged as a possibility,"" Deutsche Bank strategist George Saravelos wrote in a note earlier this month. Saravelos noted that the correlation between the dollar and risk assets — ""which has been at the core of portfolio construction for many real money investors over the last decade"" — has declined in 2025. The dollar, historically viewed as a safe haven asset, has tended to strengthen during global market sell-offs. The U.S. dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, jumped from around 71 in March 2008 to roughly 86 in March 2009 as traders bought U.S. Treasurys during the Global Financial Crisis. Similar trends were seen in the March 2020 market sell-off that was spurred by the Covid-19 outbreak, as well as in 2015 when China experienced an unexpected yuan devaluation. However, in 2025, the dollar and the U.S. market have moved more in tandem. The dollar index has dropped around 4% year to date, not too far off from the S & P 500 's roughly 5% drop during the period. .SPX .DXY YTD mountain The S & P 500 vs. the ICE U.S. dollar index in 2025 ""What could be the challenge for such a strong position? The challenge, in my opinion, is Washington,"" Marcello M. Estevão, managing director and chief economist, Institute of International Finance, said at a policy conference at the National Association of Business Economics (NABE) in March. Effects of an eroding dollar De-dollarization could lead to a weaker greenback. However, this risks higher inflation for U.S. customers as the relative price of imports would become more expensive. The impact of a loss in dollar dominance ""would be most acutely felt in the U.S., where de-dollarization would likely lead to a broad depreciation and underperformance of U.S. financial assets versus the rest of the world,"" according to an October note from JPMorgan's global research team. American companies have benefited from the dollar's dominant status owing to less foreign exchange risk compared to other global companies, which often have to hedge their currencies to maintain stability against the dollar. The pain would extend to the U.S. federal government, which is now grappling with a record high deficit level. The Congressional Budget Office projected in its March 2025 Long-Term Budget Outlook that the U.S.'s debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to reach 107% of economic output by the 2029 fiscal year. Up until now, the U.S. has been able to borrow at a lower cost relative to other countries thanks to steady global demand for dollars. ""Because the world loves our assets, we are compelled to run deficits,"" Stephen Jen, CEO at Eurizon SLJ Capital Limited, said in a panel discussion at the NABE conference. However, de-dollarization — effectively a decline in demand from foreign parties for dollar holdings — would mean that the U.S. government would have to offer higher interest rates on its debt, worsening the deficit. While the dollar's collapse doesn't seem immediately on the horizon, the risks of a fall in dollar hegemony are higher than ever for the U.S. ""The fiscal trajectory is unsustainable, and I think time is collapsing on us right now. … I don't know if the dollar reserve currency status ends completely. But I do think we're in a period of very rapid change in the global capital markets,"" said Julia Coronado, founder and president at MacroPolicy Perspectives. —CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.

https://cnbc.com,Wedbush says Texas Roadhouse is owning casual dining. Here's where we would buy more,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/wedbush-says-texas-roadhouse-is-owning-casual-dining-heres-where-we-would-buy-more.html,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Wedbush analysts said Texas Roadhouse is the ""primary transaction share gainer"" in casual dining right now and raised its price target on shares. The news Wedbush increased estimates for the company's first and second quarter same-store sales growth, citing a boost in dining out thanks to better weather. A more seasoned staff and faster turnarounds for tables are other factors improving Texas Roadhouse's operations, analysts said, and also raised their full-year projections. On the flip side of this, Wedbush stayed a bit conservative on 2025 margin estimates. Though Wedbush says they aren't seeing much risk to 3-4% commodity inflation and 4-5% labor inflation guidance, they factored in commodity inflation above the midpoint of guidance. Wedbush analysts anticipate additional potential share buybacks from Texas Roadhouse management following a $500 million authorization late February. The company has a historical track record of aggressively buying back the stock when share prices are down, analysts said. The firm raised the restaurant's target price ten bucks to $210 from $200, and maintained its outperform rating. Big picture Wedbush's read on Texas Roadhouse parallels the positive outlook that Darden Restaurants shared for the casual dining industry in a post-earnings call last week. As with Texas Roadhouse, Darden executives attributed top of year weakness within its chains to poor weather, but said spring would be the start of a comeback season for the industry. Texas Roadhouse has not yet released any data on its progress in March. But analysts see positive signs for a chain that carries a reputation of providing quality food at a good value to consumers, a winning formula in uncertain times. Analysts at Bank of America met with Texas Roadhouse executive management earlier this month, and they reiterated ""weather-driven changes in consumer behavior"" but said ""there are no signs of worsening sentiment."" The company is prioritizing the maintenance of excellent restaurant operations and maximizing profits, Bank of America analysts noted. Bottom Line The Investing Club is aligned with Wedbush's note as we agree that inclement weather played a significant role in the softness in January and February. Although consumers don't enjoy dining out in bad weather, the underlying health of the company was strong as demonstrated in their fourth-quarter earnings, said Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club. Jim Cramer is bullish on Texas Roadhouse, saying that the news from Wedbush was terrific for the company during Friday's morning meeting. Initially, Jim was concerned that Texas Roadhouse's same store sales would remain subdued following a difficult start this year but said it turns out that he was wrong. The stock is trading down 4% year to date, less hard hit than many of its industry peers, said Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club. We last purchased additional shares of Texas Roadhouse twice earlier in March at $176 and $178. We would absolutely buy more shares of the stock if it dips below $170.

The more than 9 million student loan borrowers who are estimated to be late on their payments could experience ""significant drops"" in their credit scores during the first half of 2025, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York warns.

Some people with a student loan delinquency could see their scores fall by as much as 171 points, the Fed writes in a March 26 report. Credit scores, which impact people's ability and costs to borrow, typically range from 300 to 850, with around 670 and higher considered good.

The expected drop was highest for borrowers who start with the best scores. Among those with scores under 620, the reported new delinquency could lead to an average 87-point decline.

""Although some of these borrowers may be able to cure their delinquencies,"" the Fed writes, ""the damage to their credit standing will have already been done and will remain on their credit reports for seven years.""

It's been a long time since federal student loan borrowers have needed to worry about the consequences of missed payments, which can also include the garnishment of wages and retirement benefits. That's because collection activity was suspended during the pandemic and for a while after. That relief period officially expired on Sept. 30, 2024.",cnbc
