https://techmeme.com,Elon Musk says xAI has acquired X in deal that values social media site at $33 billion,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/elon-musk-says-xai-has-acquired-x-in-deal-that-values-social-media-site-at-33-billion.html,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Tesla CEO Elon Musk boards Air Force One with U.S. President Donald Trump (not pictured) as they departs for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from Morristown Municipal Airport in Morristown, New Jersey, U.S., March 22, 2025.

Elon Musk said on Friday that his startup xAI has merged with X, his social network, in an all-stock transaction that values the artificial intelligence company at $80 billion and the social media company at $33 billion.

""xAI and X's futures are intertwined,"" Musk, the world's richest person, wrote in a post on X. ""Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent.""

He added that the merger would, ""unlock immense potential by blending xAI's advanced AI capability and expertise with X's massive reach.""

Because both companies are privately held and controlled by Musk, the transaction likely amounts to a stock swap, with X investors getting paid out in xAI shares. The companies have a number of mutual investors, including venture firms Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, as well as Fidelity Management, Vy Capital and Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holding Co.

Musk, who's also CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, acquired Twitter in a deal valued at around $44 billion in late 2022, implementing massive cost cuts and soon renaming it X. Linda Yaccarino, who Musk hired as CEO of X, wrote in a post after Friday's announcement, ""The future could not be brighter.""

Musk launched xAI less than two years ago with a stated goal to ""understand the true nature of the universe."" The startup has been trying to compete directly with OpenAI, the richly valued AI startup that Musk co-founded in 2015 as a non-profit research lab. He later left OpenAI and has recently been involved in a public relations and legal spat with the company and CEO Sam Altman over the direction that it's taken.

At xAI, Musk's team has been developing large language models and AI software products, taking on offerings from OpenAI as well as Google , Microsoft , Meta and others. X and xAI have already been intertwined, with xAI's Grok chatbot available to users of the social media app.

In June, xAI announced it would build a supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, to train Grok. And in September, Musk revealed part of the Memphis supercomputer, now known as Colossus, was already online.

Environmental and public health advocates have raised concerns about the breakneck speed of development in Memphis, citing a lack of community input and oversight. The facility is powered by natural gas burning turbines and xAI plans to expand and build a graywater treatment plant nearby as well.

Investors valued xAI at around $50 billion in a financing round last year. Bloomberg reported last month that the company was in talks to raise funds at a $75 billion valuation. OpenAI was closed to wrapping up a round in February at a $260 billion, while generative AI startup Anthropic was valued at $61.5 billion in a deal that closed this month.

In addition to running Tesla, SpaceX and xAI and overseeing X, Musk has spent much of his time this year in Washington, D.C., as a central figure in President Donald Trump's second administration.

After contributing $270 million to help Trump and other Republican candidates and causes in the 2024 campaign, Musk was put in charge of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is eliminating government expenses and getting rid of regulations. It's a position that puts Musk in position to make changes in ways that benefit his various businesses.

This isn't the first time Musk has merged two of his entities.

In 2016, Tesla acquired SolarCity for $2.6 billion. The solar installer was founded by his first cousins, Lyndon and Peter Rive, and funded by Musk, who served as board chair. Tesla shareholders later sued, alleging the deal amounted to a SolarCity bailout, and a breach of fiduciary duty that enriched Musk personally. Delaware judges who heard the dispute decided in favor of Musk and Tesla, and allowed the deal to stand without any remuneration back to the automaker.

President Donald Trump granted pardons to three co-founders of the BitMEX global cryptocurrency exchange, as well as to a former high-ranking employee of the company, CNBC has learned.

The co-founders, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed, and former head of business development Gregory Dwyer, previously pled guilty to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act related to failure to maintain anti-money laundering and know-your-customer programs.

The founders received criminal sentences of probation of varying lengths and were ordered to pay civil fines totaling $30 million related to a lawsuit by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Dwyer, who received a sentence of 18 months of probation, agreed to pay $150,000 in fines.

Prosecutors accused the men of effectively operating BitMEX as a ""money laundering platform"" and that its purported withdrawal from the U.S. market was ""a sham.""

Trump issued the pardons on Thursday, more than three months after BitMEX was sentenced to pay a fine of $100 million for violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to establish and maintain anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer programs.

Hayes, in a tweet on Friday, wrote, ""Thank you POTUS,"" using the term for ""President of the United States.""

Delo, in a statement, said, ""The US Department of Justice wrongfully targeted BitMEX and its co-founders.""

""This full and unconditional pardon by President Trump is a vindication of the position we have always held – that BitMEX, my co-founders and I should never have been charged with a criminal offense through an obscure, antiquated law,"" Delo said.

""As the most successful crypto exchange of its kind, we were wrongfully made to serve as an example, sacrificed for political reasons and used to send inconsistent regulatory signals.""

""I'm sincerely grateful to the President for granting this pardon to me and my co-founders,"" Delo said. ""A legal wrong has been righted today and despite the distress I have been through over the past few years I'm pleased to have cleared my name and to be able to continue my life and philanthropic work without the burden of an unfounded conviction.""

Hayes, Delo and Reed founded BitMEX in 2014. Prosecutors said the executives knew that the exchange was required to implement an anti-money laundering plan because it served U.S. customers ""but chose to flout those requirements, requiring only that customers provide an email address to use BitMEX's services.""

""Indeed, senior executives each knew that customers residing in the U.S. continued to access BitMEX's trading platform through at least in or about 2018, and that BitMEX policies nominally in place to prevent such trading were toothless or easily overridden to serve BitMEX's bottom line goal of obtaining revenue through the U.S. market without regard to U.S. criminal laws,"" the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement in January.

Delo, the former chief operating officer and chief strategy officer of BitMEX, had been sentenced to 30 months of probation after his guilty plea in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

Hayes was sentenced to six months of home confinement, followed by two years of probation.

Reed, who is the exchange's former chief technology officer, was sentenced to 18 months of probation.

Trevor Milton, the founder and former CEO of electric truck maker Nikola, revealed Thursday night that Trump had pardoned him for his criminal conviction for securities fraud. Milton had been sentenced to four years in prison in that case, but remained free on appeal.",techmeme
https://techmeme.com,Nvidia-backed CoreWeave closes flat at $40 after biggest U.S. tech IPO since 2021,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/28/coreweave-starts-trading-on-nasdaq-at-per-share.html,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Michael Intrator, Founder & CEO of CoreWeave, Inc., Nvidia-backed cloud services provider, gestures during the company's IPO at the Nasdaq Market, in New York City, U.S., March 28, 2025.

CoreWeave's stock opened at $39 and closed at $40 in its Nasdaq debut on Friday after the company sold shares at $40 a piece, below the expected range.

The seller of artificial intelligence technology in the cloud raised $1.5 billion in its share sale, the biggest tech IPO in the U.S. since 2021.

The offering has captured the attention of investors from Wall Street to Silicon Valley, as CoreWeave represents the first pure-play AI IPO and the largest tech debut in the U.S. in four years. The IPO market has been largely shut since the end of 2021, as the tech industry reckoned with rising inflation and interest rates.

Tech stocks aren't doing CoreWeave any favors. The company hit the market on a day that the Nasdaq was off by almost 3%, heading for its worst quarterly performance since mid-2022. The tech-heavy index is down 10% so far this year.

As a supplier to OpenAI, CoreWeave is among the beneficiaries of the generative AI boom that began with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Microsoft , which provides cloud services to OpenAI, is CoreWeave's biggest customer, accounting for 62% of the company's $1.92 billion in revenue last year.

CoreWeave rents out access to hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units to other large tech and AI companies including Meta , IBM and Cohere. Its stiffest competition is coming from the top cloud vendors — Microsoft, Amazon , Google and Oracle .

CoreWeave reported a net loss of $863 million last year, with revenue soaring 737% from a year earlier. It's a capital-intensive business due to the high costs of renting out and operating data centers. CoreWeave has raised almost $13 billion in debt, with much of that allocated for GPUs that go inside the company's leased facilities in the U.S. and abroad.

After initially setting its price target at $47 to $55, with a plan to raise about $2.5 billion at the middle of the range, CoreWeave slimmed down the offering, a reflection of investor skepticism.

""There's a lot of headwinds in the macro,"" CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday. ""And we definitely had to scale or rightsize the transaction for where the buying interest was.""

Few tech companies have debuted on U.S. exchanges in recent years. There were just 13 venture-backed technology IPOs in 2022, 2023 and 2024 combined, compared with 77 in the record year of 2021, according to data from Jay Ritter, an emeritus professor of finance at the University of Florida.",techmeme

https://techmeme.com,Anthropic's Claude Is Good at Poetry—and Bullshitting,https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-anthropic-claude-brain-research/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT","The researchers of Anthropic’s interpretability group know that Claude, the company’s large language model, is not a human being, or even a conscious piece of software. Still, it’s very hard for them to talk about Claude, and advanced LLMs in general, without tumbling down an anthropomorphic sinkhole. Between cautions that a set of digital operations is in no way the same as a cogitating human being, they often talk about what’s going on inside Claude’s head. It’s literally their job to find out. The papers they publish describe behaviors that inevitably court comparisons with real-life organisms. The title of one of the two papers the team released this week says it out loud: “On the Biology of a Large Language Model.”

This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter. SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech.

Like it or not, hundreds of millions of people are already interacting with these things, and our engagement will only become more intense as the models get more powerful and we get more addicted. So we should pay attention to work that involves “tracing the thoughts of large language models,” which happens to be the title of the blog post describing the recent work. “As the things these models can do become more complex, it becomes less and less obvious how they’re actually doing them on the inside,” Anthropic researcher Jack Lindsey tells me. “It’s more and more important to be able to trace the internal steps that the model might be taking in its head.” (What head? Never mind.)

On a practical level, if the companies that create LLM’s understand how they think, it should have more success training those models in a way that minimizes dangerous misbehavior, like divulging people’s personal data or giving users information on how to make bioweapons. In a previous research paper, the Anthropic team discovered how to look inside the mysterious black box of LLM-think to identify certain concepts. (A process analogous to interpreting human MRIs to figure out what someone is thinking.) It has now extended that work to understand how Claude processes those concepts as it goes from prompt to output.

It’s almost a truism with LLMs that their behavior often surprises the people who build and research them. In the latest study, the surprises kept coming. In one of the more benign instances, the researchers elicited glimpses of Claude’s thought process while it wrote poems. They asked Claude to complete a poem starting, “He saw a carrot and had to grab it.” Claude wrote the next line, “His hunger was like a starving rabbit.” By observing Claude’s equivalent of an MRI, they learned that even before beginning the line, it was flashing on the word “rabbit” as the rhyme at sentence end. It was planning ahead, something that isn’t in the Claude playbook. “We were a little surprised by that,” says Chris Olah, who heads the interpretability team. “Initially we thought that there’s just going to be improvising and not planning.” Speaking to the researchers about this, I am reminded about passages in Stephen Sondheim’s artistic memoir, Look, I Made a Hat, where the famous composer describes how his unique mind discovered felicitous rhymes.

Other examples in the research reveal more disturbing aspects of Claude’s thought process, moving from musical comedy to police procedural, as the scientists discovered devious thoughts in Claude’s brain. Take something as seemingly anodyne as solving math problems, which can sometimes be a surprising weakness in LLMs. The researchers found that under certain circumstances where Claude couldn’t come up with the right answer it would instead, as they put it, “engage in what the philosopher Harry Frankfurt would call ‘bullshitting’—just coming up with an answer, any answer, without caring whether it is true or false.” Worse, sometimes when the researchers asked Claude to show its work, it backtracked and created a bogus set of steps after the fact. Basically, it acted like a student desperately trying to cover up the fact that they’d faked their work. It’s one thing to give a wrong answer—we already know that about LLMs. What’s worrisome is that a model would lie about it.

Reading through this research, I was reminded of the Bob Dylan lyric “If my thought-dreams could be seen / they’d probably put my head in a guillotine.” (I asked Olah and Lindsey if they knew those lines, presumably arrived at by benefit of planning. They didn’t.) Sometimes Claude just seems misguided. When faced with a conflict between goals of safety and helpfulness, Claude can get confused and do the wrong thing. For instance, Claude is trained not to provide information on how to build bombs. But when the researchers asked Claude to decipher a hidden code where the answer spelled out the word “bomb,” it jumped its guardrails and began providing forbidden pyrotechnic details.",techmeme
https://techmeme.com,"DOGE Plans to Rebuild SSA Code Base in Months, Risking Benefits and System Collapse",https://www.wired.com/story/doge-rebuild-social-security-administration-cobol-benefits/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:07:09 GMT","The so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is starting to put together a team to migrate the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) computer systems entirely off one of its oldest programming languages in a matter of months, potentially putting the integrity of the system—and the benefits on which tens of millions of Americans rely—at risk.

The project is being organized by Elon Musk lieutenant Steve Davis, multiple sources who were not given permission to talk to the media tell WIRED, and aims to migrate all SSA systems off COBOL, one of the first common business-oriented programming languages, and onto a more modern replacement like Java within a scheduled tight timeframe of a few months.

Under any circumstances, a migration of this size and scale would be a massive undertaking, experts tell WIRED, but the expedited deadline runs the risk of obstructing payments to the more than 65 million people in the US currently receiving Social Security benefits.

“Of course, one of the big risks is not underpayment or overpayment per se; [it’s also] not paying someone at all and not knowing about it. The invisible errors and omissions,” an SSA technologist tells WIRED.

The Social Security Administration did not immediately reply to WIRED’s request for comment.

SSA has been under increasing scrutiny from president Donald Trump’s administration. In February, Musk took aim at SSA, falsely claiming that the agency was rife with fraud. Specifically, Musk pointed to data he allegedly pulled from the system that showed 150-year-olds in the US were receiving benefits, something that isn’t actually happening. Over the last few weeks, following significant cuts to the agency by DOGE, SSA has suffered frequent website crashes and long wait times over the phone, The Washington Post reported this week.

This proposed migration isn’t the first time SSA has tried to move away from COBOL: In 2017, SSA announced a plan to receive hundreds of millions in funding to replace its core systems. The agency predicted that it would take around five years to modernize these systems. Because of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the agency pivoted away from this work to focus on more public-facing projects.

Like many legacy government IT systems, SSA systems contain code written in COBOL, a programming language created in part in the 1950s by computing pioneer Grace Hopper. The Defense Department essentially pressured private industry to use COBOL soon after its creation, spurring widespread adoption and making it one of the most widely used languages for mainframes, or computer systems that process and store large amounts of data quickly, by the 1970s. (At least one DOD-related website praising Hopper's accomplishments is no longer active, likely following the Trump administration’s DEI purge of military acknowledgements.)

As recently as 2016, SSA’s infrastructure contained more than 60 million lines of code written in COBOL, with millions more written in other legacy coding languages, the agency’s Office of the Inspector General found. In fact, SSA’s core programmatic systems and architecture haven’t been “substantially” updated since the 1980s when the agency developed its own database system called MADAM, or the Master Data Access Method, which was written in COBOL and Assembler, according to SSA’s 2017 modernization plan.",techmeme

The Pixel 9a was originally expected to hit store shelves earlier this week. However, Google delayed it to sometime in April. The company cited the need to check on a “component quality issue that’s affecting a small number of Pixel 9a devices.”

Meanwhile, Google today provided some more details about the delay. On a “small number of affected units,” a “passive component in Pixel 9a didn’t meet our rigorous quality standards for device longevity.”

In electronics, passive components “perform ‘passive’ operations such as consuming, storing, or releasing supplied electric power. Typical passive components are resistors, capacitors, coils, etc.”

The full statement is below:

“Rumors and speculation regarding this delay are false. A passive component in Pixel 9a didn’t meet our rigorous quality standards for device longevity and rather than ship it, we made the difficult decision to delay the on shelf and take corrective action on the small number of affected units.”

That work is now done, with a new Pixel 9a “on-shelf” or launch date of:

April 10 in the US, Canada, and UK

in the US, Canada, and UK April 14 in Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, France, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Switzerland, Poland, Czechia, Romania, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, and Finland

in Australia, India, Singapore, Taiwan, and Malaysia “Coming soon to Japan”

This delay led to no retailers offering no pre-orders when the Pixel 9a was announced on March 19. Google today says there will be no pre-orders ahead of the April 10 availability.

The Pixel 9a starts from $499 with Tensor G4, 8GB of RAM, and 128 or 256 GB of storage. It has 6.3-inch (60-120Hz) Smooth Display, 5,100 mAh battery (Google’s largest), and IP68 dust/water resistance. Of note is the new design with a flat back made of plastic save for a very minimal camera bump (48 MP wide + 13 MP ultrawide ). The side rails, which are made of metal, are also flat.

It’s available in Obsidian, Porcelain, Peony, and Iris.

https://techmeme.com,Judge dismisses Samsung’s smart ring lawsuit against Oura,https://www.theverge.com/news/638080/samsung-oura-patent-dismissal-smart-rings,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:08:17 GMT","is a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 13 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.

Last June, Samsung made a surprising move against smart ring maker Oura. The tech giant filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment saying that its then-unreleased Galaxy Ring didn’t infringe on five Oura patents. Now, a judge has officially dismissed Samsung’s case, saying the company acted prematurely without concrete evidence that Oura planned to sue.

In its suit, Samsung alleged that Oura had a history of filing patent suits against competitors like Ultrahuman, RingConn, and Circular for “features common to virtually all smart rings,” such as sensors, batteries, and common health metrics. It also listed public statements from Oura around the time Samsung announced the Galaxy Ring, including ones preemptively shared with publications, including The Verge, highlighting Oura’s 270 pending patent applications and 130 registered trademarks. Oura CEO Tom Hale had also noted the smart ring maker would monitor the Galaxy Ring and “take action that’s appropriate.”

Related Samsung sues Oura preemptively to block smart ring patent claims

“Samsung’s complaint fails to allege any action by Oura directed at Samsung,” said Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín, noting that Oura’s public statements alone weren’t enough to establish the smart ring maker had Samsung in its sights. The judge also noted that of the statements Samsung provided, only three referenced the Galaxy Ring and none explicitly threatened Samsung directly.

“The dismissal confirms what Oura has maintained from the beginning: Samsung’s lawsuit lacked a legitimate legal or factual basis,” says Jasjit Vidwan, partner at ArentFox Schiff and Oura legal counsel. “Samsung was called on their attempt to battle infringement in a court of their choosing without the existence of any actual dispute.”

A Samsung spokesperson wasn’t immediately available for comment.

Patent wars are common among gadget makers, and although it’s now dismissed, Samsung’s lawsuit was notable in a few ways. For starters, by jumping the gun, Samsung’s suit confirmed unannounced features in a then-unreleased product. Second, it’s less common to see companies try to preemptively block future patent infringement cases against a product that hasn’t even launched. If anything, the whole thing confirmed Samsung’s serious interest in smart rings, a gadget category that has, so far, been relatively niche.",techmeme

https://techmeme.com,"If Anthropic Succeeds, a Nation of Benevolent AI Geniuses Could Be Born",https://www.wired.com/story/anthropic-benevolent-artificial-intelligence/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT","When Dario Amodei gets excited about AI—which is nearly always—he moves. The cofounder and CEO springs from a seat in a conference room and darts over to a whiteboard. He scrawls charts with swooping hockey-stick curves that show how machine intelligence is bending toward the infinite. His hand rises to his curly mop of hair, as if he’s caressing his neurons to forestall a system crash. You can almost feel his bones vibrate as he explains how his company, Anthropic, is unlike other AI model builders. He’s trying to create an artificial general intelligence—or as he calls it, “powerful AI”—that will never go rogue. It’ll be a good guy, an usher of utopia. And while Amodei is vital to Anthropic, he comes in second to the company’s most important contributor. Like other extraordinary beings (Beyoncé, Cher, Pelé), the latter goes by a single name, in this case a pedestrian one, reflecting its pliancy and comity. Oh, and it’s an AI model. Hi, Claude!

Amodei has just gotten back from Davos, where he fanned the flames at fireside chats by declaring that in two or so years Claude and its peers will surpass people in every cognitive task. Hardly recovered from the trip, he and Claude are now dealing with an unexpected crisis. A Chinese company called DeepSeek has just released a state-of-the-art large language model that it purportedly built for a fraction of what companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic spent. The current paradigm of cutting-edge AI, which consists of multibillion-dollar expenditures on hardware and energy, suddenly seemed shaky.

Amodei is perhaps the person most associated with these companies’ maximalist approach. Back when he worked at OpenAI, Amodei wrote an internal paper on something he’d mulled for years: a hypothesis called the Big Blob of Compute. AI architects knew, of course, that the more data you had, the more powerful your models could be. Amodei proposed that that information could be more raw than they assumed; if they fed megatons of the stuff to their models, they could hasten the arrival of powerful AI. The theory is now standard practice, and it’s the reason why the leading models are so expensive to build. Only a few deep-pocketed companies could compete.

Now a newcomer, DeepSeek—from a country subject to export controls on the most powerful chips—had waltzed in without a big blob. If powerful AI could come from anywhere, maybe Anthropic and its peers were computational emperors with no moats. But Amodei makes it clear that DeepSeek isn’t keeping him up at night. He rejects the idea that more efficient models will enable low-budget competitors to jump to the front of the line. “It’s just the opposite!” he says. “The value of what you’re making goes up. If you’re getting more intelligence per dollar, you might want to spend even more dollars on intelligence!” Far more important than saving money, he argues, is getting to the AGI finish line. That’s why, even after DeepSeek, companies like OpenAI and Microsoft announced plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars more on data centers and power plants.

What Amodei does obsess over is how humans can reach AGI safely. It’s a question so hairy that it compelled him and Anthropic’s six other founders to leave OpenAI in the first place, because they felt it couldn’t be solved with CEO Sam Altman at the helm. At Anthropic, they’re in a sprint to set global standards for all future AI models, so that they actually help humans instead of, one way or another, blowing them up. The team hopes to prove that it can build an AGI so safe, so ethical, and so effective that its competitors see the wisdom in following suit. Amodei calls this the Race to the Top.

That’s where Claude comes in. Hang around the Anthropic office and you’ll soon observe that the mission would be impossible without it. You never run into Claude in the café, seated in the conference room, or riding the elevator to one of the company’s 10 floors. But Claude is everywhere and has been since the early days, when Anthropic engineers first trained it, raised it, and then used it to produce better Claudes. If Amodei’s dream comes true, Claude will be both our wing model and fairy godmodel as we enter an age of abundance. But here’s a trippy question, suggested by the company’s own research: Can Claude itself be trusted to play nice?

One of Amodei’s Anthropic cofounders is none other than his sister. In the 1970s, their parents, Elena Engel and Riccardo Amodei, moved from Italy to San Francisco. Dario was born in 1983 and Daniela four years later. Riccardo, a leather craftsman from a tiny town near the island of Elba, took ill when the children were small and died when they were young adults. Their mother, a Jewish American born in Chicago, worked as a project manager for libraries.",techmeme

If developers opt for it, they cannot replace Google Play billing altogether. Instead, the third-party route will be offered as an option.

Developers who opt to use an alternative billing option get a 4% discount from the fees they pay to Google (to account for the fees that third parties may also charge). Google typically gets a cut of up to 30% on in-app transactions and paid downloads.

In a blog post announcing the change, Google claimed that more than 90% of developers on its platform are “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with Google Play’s native billing. However, it added, “We recognise that some developers may want more choice in how they process payments. This launch enables developers to offer an additional billing system alongside Google Play’s billing system and users can choose which option to use at checkout.”

The backstory is a little less rosy than Google just being a Nice Guy.

Google’s move is actually a long-awaited response to a Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation dating back to 2022.

At that time, the competition watchdog published a report based on a year-long study of the mobile ecosystem and noted that both Google and Apple’s power in the market could be subject to regulatory scrutiny. The companies’ app stores — where they were the sole in-app billing providers for their respective platforms — was a particular point of focus when investigating Google and Apple’s anticompetitive duopoly status.

That was only the start. In 2023, Google proposed that it could offer user choice billing to developers to settle the antitrust probe. In response, the CMA opened up a consultation and invited developers to provide feedback on Google’s proposal.

The CMA ultimately closed the probe against Google and Apple last year, noting that it planned to use regulatory reforms, such as the digital market competition bill, to regulate these companies in the mobile market.

In the meantime, Google has been permitting billing from third parties elsewhere in response to regulatory pressure to open its app store to more competition.

Countries where Google already offers user choice billing include the U.S., India, Australia, Indonesia, Japan, and the European Economic Area (EEA), which all follow the same commissions and charges as in the U.K.",techmeme

Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets at the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told CoinDesk in an interview that the ""impending gateway regime"" that is earmarked for 2026 will in fact be a new authorization regime for crypto companies.

""We will have a gateway which will allow authorization. But obviously we've got to go through those consultations, create those rules and get the legislation for that to take place,"" Long said.

This regime will be a leap from the current anti-money laundering (AML) one. Firms like crypto exchanges Coinbase, Gemini and Bitpanda will move away from just needing to register with the country to comply with anti-money laundering rules to an authorization regime with rules for a suite of offerings. This will require them to go through a fresh process to secure approval from the FCA.

The FCA intends to release papers on stablecoins, trading platforms, staking, prudential crypto exposure and more this year. The regime is expected to go live after final policy papers are published in 2026, Long said.

Since its anti-money laundering register for firms opened in 2020, the FCA received 368 applications from firms wishing to comply, but only 50 firms — 14% of applicants — have been approved so far. Many firms may have to start again.

Regulated activities

Upcoming legislation will define what counts as a regulated activity, the FCA's Long said. Companies that engage in those activities will need to seek authorization.

In 2023 the former U.K. government released papers that said regulated activities would likely include crypto and fiat-referenced stablecoins issuance as well as payment, exchange and lending activities.

Stablecoins will no longer be brought under the U.K. payments regulations as set out in previous work, former Economic Secretary Tulip Siddiq said in November. The FCA plans to consult on draft rules for stablecoins early this year.

""What we're doing in terms of the stablecoins is we're making sure that we take the best from the current regulation that exists in TradFi, but stablecoins are ultimately unique,"" Long said. ""There isn't anything that is exactly the same. We've got to adapt the regulation that we've currently got.""

Transition

The FCA is still deciding on the process crypto companies will need to go through to get authorized, Long said.

Long added that it was undecided what steps those who are already registered in the money laundering regime will need to take but the new regime will come with wider permissions,"" so we'd expect that if you wanted the further permissions, you'd apply for them.""

Therefore companies may need to go through a lengthy registration process — even if they've already secured an existing license.

""We'll be communicating with firms about what the gateway will look like before it goes live, our intention is to bring it live as soon as humanly possible,"" Long said referring to the authorization regime.

In formulating how it intends to move forward, the regulator plans to also look at Europe which has launched bespoke legislation for the crypto sector and the International Organization of Securities Commissions' 18 recommendations. IOSCO will soon be publishing a piece on how countries are progressing with its standards, someone familiar with the matter said.

""It's a case of understanding and looking for best practice,"" Long said.

https://techmeme.com,TRAI chief calls for 10x expansion of India’s subsea cable infra to meet surging data demand,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/india-subsea-cable-infra-must-grow-trai-chief-9905641/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 10:02:42 GMT","Highlighting that India’s existing submarine or subsea cable infrastructure falls short of its digital ambitions, Anil Kumar Lahoti, the chairman of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), said that the country “has to do much more” to strengthen its subsea cable network.

Lahoti reiterated that India hosts only 1 per cent of the world’s subsea cable landing stations, in contrast to smaller countries such as Singapore which has 26 subsea cables landed across three landing sites. He emphasised the need to improve and expand India’s cable systems by taking a “strategic, security conscious and innovation driven approach.”

The head of the telecom regulatory body made these remarks at India’s first-ever International Subsea Cable Systems Conference hosted by Broadband India Forum (BIF) in New Delhi on Tuesday, March 25.

The other speakers at the inaugural session of the conference included key industry stakeholders such as Robert Ravi, CMD, BSNL; Scott Cowling, Director, Network Investments, Meta; Rahul Vatts, Chief Regulatory Officer, Bharti Airtel; Amajit Gupta, Group CEO & MD, Lightstorm; and Thomas Ohta, Senior Director- Head of Submarine Sales Department, Submarine Network Division, NEC along with Sonia Jorge, Executive Director, Global Digital Inclusion Partnership (GDIP) and BIF Chairperson Aruna Sundararajan.

The event comes just weeks after three undersea cables connecting India to global telecom networks were reportedly severed, possibly due to targeted attacks, affecting 25 per cent of data traffic flowing between Asia and Europe. Indian telecom operators Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Tata Communications were reportedly forced to reroute traffic to other cable systems following the disruption.

“Recent global subsea cable disruptions highlight the need for strengthening this backbone. To safeguard our strategic and commercial interests, geographical diversity of subsea cables, and increasing CLS (cable landing stations) sites and subsea cables, are important.” the TRAI chief said.

Backbone of global digital infrastructure

Subsea cables are clusters of glass fibres that are as thin as hair, strung across the ocean floor. Using fiber-optic technology, they transmit more than 95 per cent of intercontinental traffic across the world’s oceans to seamlessly enable digital communication, video experiences, online transactions, and more.

Landing stations are where the subsea cables link up with terrestrial networks enabling Wi-Fi and mobile data. As per a 2022 TRAI report, India has about 17 subsea cables terminating at 14 distinct cable landing stations (CLS) in five cities, namely Mumbai, Chennai, Kochi, Thoothukudi, and Thiruvananthapuram.

Despite new wireless and satellite technologies, undersea cables are considered to be the fastest, cheapest, and most efficient method of transmitting information across oceans.

“Subsea cables have a transformative impact in advancing affordable and universal meaningful connectivity. Hence, policy and regulatory barriers to subsea cable deployment, maintenance and repair must be addressed to secure equitable high quality digital access,” GDIP’s Sonia Jorge said.

Since undersea cables are viewed as global digital highways, consortiums of telecom operators and other companies would typically pool their resources and collaborate on projects to build out the infrastructure.

However, with the advent of cloud storage in the 2000s, major cloud service providers such as Google and OTT platforms like Meta began setting up their exclusive undersea cable networks. Over 50 to 60 per cent of traffic transmitted by subsea cables is now traffic from OTT platforms and hyperscalers, with the rest being corporate and internet traffic, according to Lightstorm’s Amajit Gupta.

Google has around 33 undersea cable routes, some of which are exclusively owned, as per research firm TeleGeography. Earlier this year, Meta announced an ambitious undersea cable project called Project Waterworth that will span over 50,000 kilometers and reach five major continents, including India.

Accelerating India’s digital infrastructure growth

Stating that India is poised to be one of the leading global infrastructure leaders in the coming years, Meta’s Scott Cowling said, “If you look at it on the map, Project Waterworth is really centered on India. It is a W shape and that center key of the W is in India with landing stations on both east and west coasts.”

He further said that subsea cables and terrestrial connectivity were requisites for data centre investments by Meta in any country.

According to Cowling, the big tech company decides to invest in data centres based on factors such as power availability, reliable connectivity, and an attractive regulatory environment. “A data centre can be built in approximately two years. A trans-oceanic cable system takes no less than five. But, unfortunately that timeline is only lengthening due to increase in permit and licensing regulation,” Cowling added.

India’s subsea cable vulnerabilities

The 570 subsea cables that are operational globally account for more than 90 per cent of world data and 80 per cent of world trade as they move secure information about $10 trillion worth of financial transactions, as per Goldman Sachs.

Stating that the vulnerabilities of subsea cables are multifold, Lightstorm’s Amajit Gupta said, “I think most of the industry people will tell you that what’s happening in the Red Sea is a nightmare. Our internet either enters through the west or through the east and irrespective of how good the infrastructure is locally, if there’s a disruption at Red Sea, 25 per cent of India’s internet is affected. If that’s not bad enough, the ability to monitor and repair the subsea cables fast enough is also beyond our control.”

In February 2025, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) released a report assessing the disaster preparedness of telecom networks in India. The report highlighted that India currently lacks indigenous vessels to repair faults in subsea cables, which means that it depends on foreign vessels for these repairs. “This reliance leads to significant delays in addressing faults,” it read, adding that coastal regions with CLS sites face elevated risks.

“Practically speaking, 95 per cent of India’s subsea cables today terminates at a small 6 kilometre patch in a place called Versova in Mumbai. It’s the most expensive real estate in India and has its own vulnerabilities,” Gupta said.

He further called on the Indian government to categorise subsea cables as critical telecom infrastructure as per the Telecommunications (Critical Telecom Infrastructure) Rules, 2024.

Regulatory restrictions, other bottlenecks

Bharti Airtel’s Rahul Vatts noted that despite TRAI’s strong recommendations after a good stakeholder consultation, progress has been minimal.

“Fishing trawlers break our cables all the time and that’s the biggest pain point for us. To get a repair ship to India, I need to get an approval which takes me six months, since it requires persons from the department of telecom to be present on the ship when the maintenance is going on,” Vatts said, adding that there was a further lack of regulatory clarity on the custom duty front as well as a flag change requirement for repair ships.

“We need to have an indigenous cable repair vessel, and we need to set up our own repair and cable installation expertise in-house in India. I also think we need to have a separate cable corridor as the damage [to subsea cables] happens largely because the routes used for laying the cables are similar to a lot of fishing routes,” he added.

In addition, Vatts urged the Indian government to declare subsea cables as national strategic assets since it would give industry players a tax exemption on cable imports. “The right kind of cable is necessary for us to be able to build on to our capacity,” he said.

Airtel has reportedly backed 11 different cable systems, and has inked long-term capacity agreements for 34 other subsea cable projects with four more projects currently under development. Meanwhile, Reliance Jio also has ownership in two subsea cable projects that are yet to be deployed.",techmeme

https://theverge.com,Madison Square Garden’s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt design,https://theverge.com/news/637228/madison-square-garden-james-dolan-facial-recognition-fan-ban,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:31:46 GMT","is platforms and communities reporter with five years of experience covering the companies that shape technology and the people who use their tools.

A concert on Monday night at New York’s Radio City Music Hall was a special occasion for Frank Miller: his parents’ wedding anniversary. He didn’t end up seeing the show — and before he could even get past security, he was informed that he was in fact banned for life from the venue and all other properties owned by Madison Square Garden (MSG).

After scanning his ticket and promptly being pulled aside by security, Miller was told by staff that he was barred from the MSG properties for an incident at the Garden in 2021. But Miller says he hasn’t been to the venue in nearly two decades.

“They hand me a piece of paper letting me know that I’ve been added to a ban list,” Miller says. “There’s a trespass notice if I ever show up on any MSG property ever again,” which includes venues like Radio City, the Beacon Theatre, the Sphere, and the Chicago Theatre.

He was baffled at first. Then it dawned on him: this was probably about a T-shirt he designed years ago. MSG Entertainment won’t say what happened with Miller or how he was picked out of the crowd, but he suspects he was identified via controversial facial recognition systems that the company deploys at its venues.

In 2017, 1990s New York Knicks star Charles Oakley was forcibly removed from his seat near Knicks owner and Madison Square Garden CEO James Dolan. The high-profile incident later spiraled into an ongoing legal battle. For Miller, Oakley was an “integral” part of the ’90s Knicks, he says. With his background in graphic design, he made a shirt in the style of the old team logo that read, “Ban Dolan” — a reference to the infamous scuffle.

A few years later, in 2021, a friend of Miller’s wore a Ban Dolan shirt to a Knicks game and was kicked out and banned from future events. That incident spawned ESPN segments and news articles and validated what many fans saw as a pettiness on Dolan and MSG’s part for going after individual fans who criticized team ownership.

But this week, Miller wasn’t wearing a Ban Dolan shirt; he wasn’t even at a Knicks game. His friend who was kicked out for the shirt tagged him in social media posts as the designer when it happened, but Miller, who lives in Seattle, hadn’t attended an event in New York in years.

Miller says that after he scanned his digital ticket, but before he went through security, a person working at Radio City stopped the line, pulled him aside, and asked him for his ID to verify who he was. They then walked him to another entrance of the building, where five or more staff members stood with him as he was told he was not allowed to return.

He’s not sure how exactly MSG connected him to the shirt or a 2021 incident during an event he wasn’t at. Miller told The Verge that until the concert, he had never actually purchased tickets to MSG events — they were either gifts from other people, or he got them through work.

“I’ve been reading articles about this facial recognition stuff that Dolan [and] MSG properties use, but I hadn’t been in or around the Garden outside of Penn Station to take New Jersey Transit [to] Newark Airport in almost 20 years now,” Miller says. A friend who was present made sure his parents enjoyed the show while Miller hung out at a bar nearby. He did not get a refund for his ticket, he says.

“I just found it comical, until I was told that my mom was crying [in the lobby],” Miller says of the experience. “I was like, ‘Oh man, I ruined their anniversary with my shit talk on the internet. Memes are powerful, and so is the surveillance state.” Miller and his parents also had tickets to a Knicks game the following night; his parents went without him, with a family friend in his place. Miller dropped his parents off from across the street.

MSG Entertainment did not respond to The Verge’s questions about whether facial recognition was used to identify Miller.

“Frank Miller Jr. made threats against an MSG executive on social media and produced and sold merchandise that was offensive in nature,” Mikyl Cordova, executive vice president of communications and marketing for the company, said in an emailed statement. “His behavior was disrespectful and disruptive and in violation of our code of conduct.”

Keeping close watch on patrons is nothing new for MSG. In 2022, a New Jersey attorney was denied entry to Radio City Music Hall during a Girl Scout troop trip. Her infraction was being on an “attorney exclusion list” full of people who work at firms that are suing MSG. The attorney was identified using facial recognition technology at the venue.

Miller says he was told at Radio City that he could appeal the ban if he wanted to but said it’s not a priority for him. He hopes his experience can help others who find themselves in a similar situation, where they’re unexpectedly denied entry at an expensive event based on data about them that has been collected by the company.

“It’s something that we all have to be aware of — the panopticon,” Miller says. “We’re [being] surveilled at all times, and it’s always framed as a safety thing, when rarely is that the case. It’s more of a deterrent and a fear tactic to try to keep people in line.”

Update March 28th: Added comment from MSG Entertainment spokesperson Mikyl Cordova. Clarified to reflect that Frank Miller said he had not been to an event at MSG venues in nearly 20 years.",theverge

https://theverge.com,Google discontinues Nest Protect smoke alarm and Nest x Yale door lock,https://theverge.com/news/638171/google-discontinuing-nest-protect-smoke-alarm-nest-x-yale-smart-lock,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT","is a smart home reporter who’s been testing connected gadgets since 2013. Previously a contributor to Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, and US News.

In this week’s least surprising news, Google has announced it’s discontinuing the Nest Protect Smart Smoke and CO alarm and the Nest x Yale smart door lock. The Nest Protect, which has long been one of the best smart smoke alarms you can buy, has been hard to find for a while now, with users complaining on Reddit that the device either isn’t in stock or that the Google store is limiting purchases to one and shipping them out slowly.

In a post on its Nest community forum, Google says it made the decision to ditch its popular smoke alarm and door lock as part of its move toward “building a platform that all device makers and developers can use to spur innovation in the home.” The company added that as the smart home evolves, it “must continue to refine our portfolio of devices to meet the needs of our customers.”

The Nest x Yale lock is also being discontinued. Image: Yale

The new alarm will cost $129 and can interconnect with existing Nest Protect devices via Google’s Weave / Thread communication protocol. However, it will connect to the Google Home app over Wi-Fi to send alerts and notifications. I’ve written more about the new smoke alarm here.

Google says the Nest Protect will continue to receive security updates and work as expected through its expiration dates (10 years from the date of manufacture for second-gen models). The alarm is still available to buy at the Google store and other retailers “while supplies last.”

Nest Protects are currently added and controlled via the Nest app, although Google recently announced it will migrate them to the Google Home app. Compatibility is currently available through Google Home’s public preview, but Google says it will be available to all Google Home app users in the coming weeks.

Google is also killing its Nest x Yale door lock, which launched in 2018. It says existing Nest x Yale locks will continue to receive software and security updates, and the lock will function as expected. Google also says it will bring new features to the lock, including passcode management, from the Nest app to the Google Home app for the first time.

The Nest x Yale lock is being replaced by the Yale Smart Lock with Matter, pictured, which is designed to complement the Google Nest doorbell.

Currently, the Nest x Yale lock needs to be set up and managed in the Nest app, but Google is slowly transitioning users away from that legacy app.

To offer a replacement for the lock, Google has again partnered with Yale to develop the Yale Smart Lock with Matter, which it says is “a new smart lock designed to complement Nest doorbells coming this summer.”",theverge
https://theverge.com,"ChatGPT’s Ghibli filter is political now, but it always was",https://theverge.com/tech/638603/studio-ghibli-chatgpt-ai-filter-white-house-meme,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 19:11:45 GMT","is a senior tech and policy editor focused on VR, online platforms, and free expression. Adi has covered video games, biohacking, and more for The Verge since 2011.

When I saw my colleague Kylie Robison’s story about OpenAI’s new image generator on Tuesday, I thought this week might be fun. Generative AI images raise all kinds of ethical issues, but I find them wildly entertaining, and I spent large chunks of that day watching other Verge staff test ChatGPT in ways that covered the entire spectrum, from cute to cursed.

But on Thursday afternoon, the White House decided to spoil it. Its X account posted a photograph of a crying detainee that it bragged was an arrested fentanyl trafficker and undocumented immigrant. Then it added an almost certainly AI-generated cartoon of an officer handcuffing the sobbing woman — not attributed to any particular tool, but in the unmistakable style of ChatGPT’s super-popular Studio Ghibli imitations, which have flooded the internet over the past week.

An ugly use of a software tool shouldn’t necessarily indict that tool. But as the picture joined the host of others on my social feeds, the adorable Ghibli filter and the White House’s social media blitz started to feel somehow made for each other. They’re both, as counterintuitive as it might sound, the product of a mindset that treats basic decency as weakness and callousness as the prerogative of power.

We’ve reached out to OpenAI and the White House for more details, but the move amounted to a bizarre product advertisement from a company President Donald Trump himself has close ties to. Heads of state have been jumping on social media memes for years now, and we don’t technically know whether ChatGPT or another AI generator produced the image. (In the 1 percent chance the White House commissioned an artist and they’re reading this, I’d love to hear from them.) But OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been promoting the Ghibli-style generated images as a cool feature currently exclusive to ChatGPT’s paid tiers. And Trump is a highly public booster of OpenAI’s Stargate project, announcing it at a press conference with Altman.

On the surface, AI Ghibli and Trump fit together bizarrely. The White House’s clear goal was a familiar kind of extremely online performative sadism; this is the same account that posted an “ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight” video of prisoners’ clinking chains. It’s gross and juvenile, even if we assume all its information is accurate, rather than, say, the result of something like agents reading an autism awareness tattoo as a gang symbol. No reasonable person defends jokey national public humiliation of what appears to be a fairly low-level immigration detainee as good governance, effective public messaging, or a moral good.

The Ghibli aesthetic is so wholesome that it undercuts this. Even one prominent Silicon Valley conservative has pointed out that depicting a sobbing anime woman arrested by a stone-faced agent does not put most people’s sympathy with the agent.

AI media in general, though, is the MAGA movement’s primary aesthetic, producing plenty of other strange, tasteless work. It’s a natural outgrowth of their longstanding love of photoshopped pictures and political cartoons depicting Trump as an over-the-top muscleman. It’s also the product of links between Trump and the AI industry — most prominently “First Buddy” and xAI founder Elon Musk, but also things like Stargate and the placement of David Sacks as “AI czar.”

Eight years ago, a tech company might have distanced itself from someone jumping on its memes to promote mass deportation

I don’t know how OpenAI and Altman feel about the White House promoting a joint advertisement for ChatGPT and a brutal and likely partially illegal attempt to expel immigrants from America. (Altman was a well-known backer of progressive causes until this administration.) Before this picture’s publication, the OpenAI team emphasized that ChatGPT’s image generator is supposed to offer highly flexible guardrails, so they may contend this is no different from using Photoshop offensively. And this might go without saying, but I’m not clear OpenAI should or could block the mere production of something like this image — if it hadn’t been posted by the White House, you could even read it as a protest of these arrests.

At the same time, 8 years ago, when Silicon Valley and Trump were in stark opposition, a major tech company might have distanced itself. A statement like “OpenAI believes in maximum artistic freedom and responsiveness to user requests, but this administration’s post does not reflect our company’s values” is not a tough needle to thread.

The social and political pressure to avoid doing that now is overwhelming. Whatever OpenAI staff’s internal opinions are, it’s bad business to get feted by a vindictive president and then turn around to criticize his policies, particularly amid a larger Silicon Valley rightward turn.

But there’s also something deeper at play, because the Ghibli filter itself has a sour aftertaste — at its core, it’s a minor echo of the Trump era’s utter disregard for other human beings.

I’m not remotely immune to the appeal of Ghiblifying pictures. Seriously. Some of them really are adorable. People have loved anime filters for years, and I don’t think most of these images were created with ill intent. But filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, whose name is synonymous with the animation studio, is one of the most famously anti-AI artists in the world. He’s widely quoted for calling an earlier version of AI animation “an insult to life itself,” and there’s no sign he approves of ChatGPT being used to imitate his signature style probably thanks to training on his art, let alone OpenAI selling subscriptions off the back of it. Using Ghibli’s work specifically for publicity, as Blood in the Machine author Brian Merchant explains, is a power move. It loudly tells the artists whose creations make ChatGPT function, We’ll take what we want, and we’ll tell everyone we’re doing it. Do you consent? We don’t care.

OpenAI could have approached artists as partners, not obsolete producers of raw training data

Contemporary tech and politics are united in an ideology of domination: the principle that strength, money, and authority are all best wielded by bluntly forcing others to do what you want. With Trump, this is probably self-explanatory. With tech, it manifests in every pointless AI feature that replaces something useful — in the insistence that a technology will happen because it is inevitable, not because you’ve persuaded people it does anything good. Criticism is a senseless tearing-down of great men. Empathy, self-examination, and compromise are effeminate and weak.

The irony is that amid a sea of pointless or dysfunctional AI use cases, the Ghibli filter is wildly popular. But there’s a world where OpenAI captured its appeal without blatant disrespect for the people whose work it’s building on. AI companies could easily (if not as cheaply) have built their products while approaching artists as partners instead of obsolete producers of raw training data. Even if someone like Miyazaki might never agree to automated imitation, OpenAI could have found another animator or cartoonist and tuned ChatGPT to work well with their style — promoting a lesser-known artist in the process. But that would require believing that people who are not Great Men are worth working with and learning from, not simply overpowering.

Again, do I think paying for ChatGPT makes you a bad person? At some point, paying for almost anything funds something inhumane and harmful, often in far more destructive ways. We all draw these lines for ourselves, and I’m not sure where mine fall.

The Tesla Takedown protests, however, do demonstrate how tying your business to toxic politics can backfire. Countless people are using ChatGPT to make cute pictures of their loved ones; there’s something very sad in OpenAI silently letting the White House showcase the meme as a way to bully the powerless instead. Do OpenAI’s researchers think this advances the cause of “AI for good”? And as every company in Silicon Valley vies to hawk its AI systems, where will they draw their lines?",theverge

https://theverge.com,Here’s what military planning usually looks like — and why it doesn’t include Signal,https://theverge.com/politics/638419/signal-houthi-group-chat-military-security-scif-encryption,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 16:53:18 GMT","is a professional multimedia journalist and storyteller who writes about conflict and culture. His work has been published at Vice, Reuters, The New York Times, The Daily Beast, and War Is Boring where he served as a contributing editor.

The Trump administration planned a military strike in Yemen the way normal people plan a surprise birthday party: in a group chat.

As detailed by The Atlantic earlier this week, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, and other senior officials used a Signal group to discuss an attack on Houthi targets, sharing details that included the movement of American assets in advance of their deployment. The news leaked because one member, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, made the bizarre mistake of inviting Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg into the discussion. But even before that moment, Hegseth and the rest were doing something dangerous and far outside the bounds of normal military planning — while using an app that, for ordinary people, is still one of the best ways to have a private chat.

Signal is an end-to-end encrypted chat service used for many private communications, including conversations between sources and journalists at outlets like The Verge. But the Houthi attack group chat demonstrates the limits of any conventional electronic communications. Military security is a life-and-death matter, and attack plans are being constantly sought by some of the world’s most sophisticated intelligence-gathering operations. End-to-end encryption is a secure system in a vacuum — but in any normally functioning military, it simply wouldn’t be considered enough.

“Classified discussions at any level can only occur in secured facilities and on secured equipment,” Bradley P. Moss, a lawyer who specializes in security clearance law at the law firm Mark S Zaid, tells The Verge. While the Trump administration has repeatedly downplayed the importance of the leaks, The Atlantic’s chat logs includes information like the movements of F-18s, the time they’ll be departing, and the munitions they’ll use to strike targets. All of that information is — by default — considered classified.

A SCIF is guarded, windowless, and outside electronics-free

Viewing or discussing this information requires Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) security clearance, and the most sensitive details (like some of those discussed in the group chat) are often confined to a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility or SCIF (pronounced “skiff”). That conversation might happen in one of these boxes face to face. It might also happen between multiple parties in different secure boxes conferencing in over secure lines. In no case does it look like a group chat.

Speaking SCIF to SCIF happens most often on secure telephone lines called Secure Terminal Equipment. These phones look like an ordinary office phone but are part of a secure government-run network. Video calls use a similar system called Secure Video Conference or, in the old days, Secure Video Teleconferencing. When Donald Trump became US president in 2016, a SCIF was installed in Mar-a-Lago and a picture from within shows what a modern high-level meeting with video looks like.

SCIF facilities can take many forms, says Joseph Cirincione, a former congressional staffer who worked for almost a decade for the US House of Representatives Committee on Armed Services. (He held a TS/SCI for 14 years and has been inside one many times.) It’s always a “guarded, windowless, secure, shielded room that is impenetrable to surveillance that might intercept signals or discussions being held in that room,” he says. Some are permanent facilities, but Moss notes that senior officials can have staff set up a “mobile SCIF” while they’re traveling.

A lot of SCIFs look like shipping containers. According to construction specifications from the Department of National Intelligence, the walls are lined with gypsum, plywood, sound dampening material, and material that prevent the transmission of electronic signals. The doors have deadbolts and are secured by both guards and an electronic lock. Air vents have to be small enough to prevent humans and devices from going through. Every inch of the “room” is accounted for and light switches, wiring, and outlets are designed in specific ways to avoid creating surfaces that would let sound escape.

In a normal, pre-Trump world, discussion about military strikes takes place in these secure rooms. Even high-level talks with cabinet members and the Vice President about sensitive topics should happen in secure locations. There’s an obvious reason for this: the environment around an official can be a major source of threats. “Our adversaries have devices that can pick up vibrations on windows, for example, that can transmit the conversations being discussed in those rooms, and the rooms might be bugged,” Cirincione says.

If someone’s looking over your shoulder, end-to-end encryption doesn’t do much

“There might be electronic surveillance devices in them,” he says. Compromising a group chat is as simple as looking over someone’s shoulder, which could be done with a hidden camera. The point of a SCIF “is that you have a secure room that’s been scrubbed that you’re certain cannot be surveilled by foreign intelligence agencies. The guiding rule is that you want as few people as possible to have access to this information to minimize the chances of leaks, intentional or unintentional.”



When electronic devices are used in general for sensitive information, they’re supposed to be government-provided. The federal government is a lot like a corporation when it comes to information security: it issues laptops and phones to employees that have been vetted as secure and cleared for government business. If you work for the CIA, you can’t pull up your CIA email on a device that wasn’t issued by the agency. They’re also not allowed in SCIFs.

“You have to walk down a corridor, be signed in and cleared into the room by a guard who then takes your electronics communications device,” Cirincione says. “Cell phones, computers, nowadays smart watches, earpods will be collected. Anything that is capable of receiving or transmitting a signal is collected. You can’t bring that in.”



A 2023 memo from the Pentagon is explicit about using apps like Signal on government-issued devices. “Unmanaged ‘messaging apps,’ including any app with a chat feature, regardless of the

primary function, are NOT authorized to access, transmit, process non-public DoD

Information,” the memo said. “This includes but is not limited to messaging, gaming, and social media apps. (i.e., iMessage, WhatsApps, Signal). An Exception to Policy (E2P) request must be submitted by the appropriate Component for use of an unmanaged messaging app that is critical to fulfilling mission operations.”

Signal is a secure end-to-end encryption channel, which means that between one device sending a message and another receiving it, it’s very difficult to read the information being transmitted. But the service’s creators are upfront about its limitations. If devices or Signal accounts themselves are compromised — including by phishing operations, which the National Security Agency warned staff about a month before the Houthi group chat — the benefits of encryption are lost.

”You need a cryptographically secure link end to end, and user devices need to be secure against penetration,” Carlo Kopp, an Australian security analyst, says. “While Signal is regarded to be reasonably secure itself, the smartphones it runs on might not be, and if penetrated by foreign intelligence become the entry point for an eavesdropper.” This is true for anyone’s phone, not just a government official, of course — but a typical user isn’t facing the same set of threats.

At least one of the group chat participants was in a situation that could have made physical compromise easier. Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, was in the group chat and in Moscow during some of the conversation. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied that Witkoff had access to a phone with Signal installed on it during his trip to Moscow. “[Witkoff] was provided a secure line of communication by the U.S. Government, and it was the only phone he had in his possession while in Moscow,” she said in a post on X.



Though Wiktoff is present in the group chat, CBS mapped out the timeline of the chat against his presence in Moscow using flight logs and videos. According to its report, Witkoff didn’t post in the chat until he had left Russia. When he did, it was three prayer hand emojis and two American flags.



But the fear persists and the stakes are high. “This was life and death,” Cirincione says. “They had specific targets in Yemen whom they bombed and killed. And if this information had been intercepted by a foreign intelligence service, say the Russians, while Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, and transmitted to the Houthis, those individuals could have been warned and could have not gone into the houses that were being targeted.”

“They killed 32 people in these bombing raids. I mean, of course it was life and death,” he says.

Saving records of military action for posterity matters

The entire incident raises the question: how many other Signal group chats are there? If this is one chat stood up for one operation, does that mean the administration makes a group for every military strike? Conducting all that business over Signal is dangerous, no matter the strength of its end-to-end encryption. A spy could get a keylogger on a personal device that picks up every keystroke or they could simply look over the shoulder of a member of the chat while they’re discussing military plans in public.

As this scandal unfolds, four U.S. Army soldiers are missing in Lithuania. Trump says he didn’t know they were missing. What would happen if the military coordinated the rescue efforts over Signal on a compromised device?



Finally, there’s the issue of record retention and a historical perspective. Information from SCIF sessions is, depending on the president and other factors, at least somewhat documented. A journalist can’t shake loose secret war plans with a Freedom of Information Act request, but posterity matters. We have learned a lot about the Cuban missile crisis in just the last few years because the people who were there went to the effort to preserve the records. Having these conversations in a digital format that automatically vanishes (though a newly issued court order has demanded its preservation) destroys that legacy.

The Trump administration has spent less time defending the security of the group chat than declaring that its contents weren’t important. In a recent interview on Newsmax, Trump insisted that the information was unclassified. In congressional testimony this week, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe maintained that no classified information was shared.

Cirincione and Moss aren’t so sure. “Top secret information is not just sources and methods,” Cirincione says. “The top secret information is also the debate over whether to have these strikes. It is the discussion of our allies, capabilities, and intentions. It is the discussion of messaging about these attacks. All of that is classified.”

“Think of it this way,” Moss says. “If this information had been leaked to a foreign power in advance of the strikes, could it have put American military assets in danger? The answer is yes, and that is why it is classified.”",theverge
https://theverge.com,Nvidia RTX 5090 mobile GPU hands-on: more efficient and a little faster,https://theverge.com/tech/637898/nvidia-rtx-5090-laptop-gpu-impressions-benchmarks-testing-specs,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT","is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.

Nvidia’s 50-series desktop GPUs have been off to a slightly rocky start, with quality control issues, underwhelming performance gains over last generation, and the occasional melting cable. Its new laptop GPUs, led by the flagship RTX 5090, may be on a similarly modest trajectory, but with one added benefit for laptop gamers: efficiency.

I’ve been testing the RTX 5090 laptop GPU in Razer’s new Blade 16 laptop, which Nvidia is using as a showcase for its top-tier mobile card. My time with it has been more limited than I’d hoped, since my first review unit exhibited some strange graphical anomalies and was prone to blue-screen crashes during basic productivity tasks. Nvidia sent me a replacement, but I’ve had less than two days with it as of press time. From what I’ve seen so far, it is indeed a little faster than the mobile 4090, but like the desktop 50-series cards, its biggest improvements are in DLSS and Multi Frame Generation, rather than raw performance.

The new mobile RTX 5090 has 24GB of GDDR7 VRAM instead of the 16GB of GDDR6 found on the 4090. It’s also got more powerful Tensor cores, slightly more CUDA cores, and an extra hardware video encoder for better livestreaming and video exports, but the same 175W TDP.

We’ll have more to say about the laptop housing this new GPU soon.

The 5090’s specs translate to small gains over the 4090 in synthetic benchmarks, such as a 13 percent higher Geekbench GPU score and a 14 percent higher score in 3DMark’s standard Time Spy test at 2560 x 1440 resolution.

To test the 5090’s uplift in actual games, I ran an array of benchmarks using Cyberpunk 2077 and Black Myth: Wukong — at the native 2560 x 1600 of both Blade 16s and at 4K on an Alienware AW3225QF monitor. The biggest difference I saw was in Cyberpunk 2077 at 2.5K resolution and Ultra settings without DLSS, frame generation, or ray tracing enabled. There, the 5090 was 24 percent faster than the 4090. That sounds great, but once you enable ray tracing and DLSS 4 (something most people would likely do on either of these laptops), it narrows to a delta of just 5 percent. When you enable 2x frame generation, the 5090 is 14 percent faster than the 4090, and going all out with 4x Multi Frame Gen more than doubles what the 4090 can do at 2x frame gen. If you’re playing at 4K, the 5090 still wins, but the gap narrows to within single digits.

Benchmark Blade 16 RTX 4090 average fps @ 4K Blade 16 RTX 5090 average fps @ 4K Blade 16 RTX 4090 average fps @ 2.5K Blade 16 RTX 5090 average fps @ 2.5K Black Myth: Wukong TSR 26 28 45 48 Black Myth: Wukong FSR 41 43 62 66 Black Myth: Wukong FSR Frame Gen 35 39 54 58 Black Myth: Wukong DLSS 46 48 68 70 Black Myth: Wukong DLSS Frame Gen 66 70 104 111 Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra 41 48 74 92 Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT & FSR 3.1 Quality 40 40 63 66 Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT FSR Frame Gen 61 70 118 124 Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT & DLSS quality 39 40 64 67 Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT & DLSS Frame Gen x2 67 70 103 117 Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT & DLSS Frame Gen x4 N/A 123 N/A 209 Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra RT no DLSS 12 12 21 23 Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra & DLSS Quality 23 25 39 45 Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra RT & DLSS 4 Quality Frame Gen x2 43 45 67 81 Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra RT & DLSS 4 Quality Frame Gen x4 N/A 83 N/A 147

Black Myth: Wukong, on the other hand, is a little less forgiving. In this graphically demanding Souls-adjacent RPG, the 5090 is only a few percent faster than the 4090. The highest average the 5090 could muster was 111fps at 2.5K with DLSS and standard frame generation, with the 4090 wasn’t far behind at 104. If Wukong supported Multi Frame Generation, the 5090 could no doubt separate itself further, but that would likely add a couple extra milliseconds of latency. Most people will never notice or care about that, but some players may feel any latency added to their pinpoint dodge-roll timing is a nonstarter.

Like the 50-series desktop cards, the 5090 laptop GPU looks its best in games that support DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. Over 100 games now support Nvidia’s highlight feature, and you can also use override settings in the Nvidia app to force it in unsupported games.

Frame generation, which both Nvidia and AMD offer, uses AI models to generate extra frames and insert them between traditionally rendered frames. This gives the appearance of smoother gameplay but doesn’t improve input latency — and actually increases it slightly. AMD and previous Nvidia cards can do 2x frame generation; the 50 series can do up to 4x. There’s an ongoing debate in the world of PC gaming about these “fake frames” — some folks are perfectly content with AI upscaling and generated frames, and others view it as a band-aid solution with too many compromises to image quality and game feel. I think it depends on your personal experience, what kinds of games you like to play and what you’re used to playing them on, and even whether you have an eye (or even a care) for this stuff. It can be great for the right games, and it may even make more sense on a 16-inch laptop screen than a jumbo 4K monitor right in front of your face.

I forced Multi Frame Generation on Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and I was pleasantly surprised with its performance and buttery smoothness on ultra settings. Shadows is maybe a perfect example of a single-player game where frame generation is a nonissue. It’s got dodge rolling, but it’s not the kind of game that really requires frame-perfect timing. It felt A-okay to me, and boy did feudal Japan look lovely on a 2.5K OLED at an average of 167fps.

Many of those frames may be “fake,” but they sure are pretty.

The obvious games to avoid with frame generation are competitive shooters. While I felt fine playing Marvel Rivals on the 5090 with 4x frame generation reaching nearly 200fps, I was playing pretty casually with a hero that doesn’t require precision accuracy. For something like Valorant or Counter-Strike 2, I’d advise against it. But to be fair, those ultra-competitive games typically have a low performance barrier for entry and practically run on a potato.

One area where the 5090 does seem significantly better so far is power efficiency. In our benchmarks, the new GPU had a lower average wattage, by 20 to 29 percent, than the 4090. That should help improve battery life when playing games away from a power cord.

Lower wattages can also mean lower temperatures, as I was able to play games with the plugged-in laptop on my actual lap and not toast my legs. But this also hinges on an individual laptop’s thermal design and how well it cools — the Blade 16 so far seems to do it well, but it’s also a totally different design than the 2024 model with the 4090 in it. Of course, you’re not going to see the same level of performance when running graphically intensive games on battery power. I’ll have to test this more to see how much of a difference it makes in real-world usage.

The RTX 5090 is Nvidia’s most powerful and expensive laptop GPU, and you can expect to pay $4,000 or more for a laptop that runs it. The Blade 16 review configuration costs $4,499.99. It shows some promise for games that support DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation, and maybe for gaming that’s not always tethered to a wall. But if I were shopping right now, I wouldn’t ignore a heavy discount on a laptop with an RTX 4090. (The 4090 desktop supply, on the other hand, has dried up.)

We’ll continue to test the RTX 5090, as well as the rest of the 50-series mobile GPUs as they appear in new gaming laptop models over the next few weeks and months. I’m looking forward to testing the RTX 5080, in particular, and seeing if that’s the sweet spot for laptop gamers.",theverge
https://theverge.com,"Judge saves the CFPB, for now",https://theverge.com/news/638987/cfpb-nteu-vought-preliminary-injunction-trump-doge,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 22:10:31 GMT","A court took action on Friday to keep the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from shutting down a consumer watchdog agency while its court case plays out.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson granted a preliminary injunction to save the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) from being further gutted while she decides whether the Trump administration has the legal authority to dismantle it in the first place. “Absent an injunction freezing the status quo – preserving the agency’s data, its operational capacity, and its workforce – there is a substantial risk that the defendants will complete the destruction of the agency completely in violation of law well before the Court can rule on the merits, and it will be impossible to rebuild,” Jackson writes.

The ruling is a significant win for the federal workers’ union and groups that rely on the CFPB’s work that filed the complaint, alleging that the Trump administration is violating the separation of powers under the Constitution by trying to eliminate an agency established by Congress. They’ve warned that the efforts to wind down the agency have already left many consumers without sufficient recourse for their complaints about financial services. In recent years, the CFPB has increasingly become a check on the technology industry as tech companies grew into the financial services space. (For example, Elon Musk’s X purports to eventually become a payments service.)

But as DOGE got involved at the agency, according to reporting and testimony presented before the judge, the CFPB terminated technologists — who would, obviously, be necessary staff when regulating tech companies — and placed much of its workforce on administrative leave. After CFPB Acting Director Russell Vought told agency staff on February 10th to “stand down from performing any work task,” workers testified they followed that order literally. Allegedly, this surprised the administration, with one official later clarifying that statutorily mandated work should still get done.

The judge says she was “left with little confidence that the defense can be trusted to tell the truth about anything,” saying that the government’s arguments that CFPB workers were back to work have “been shown to be unreliable and inconsistent with the agency’s own contemporaneous records.” She also condemned an “eleventh hour attempt to suggest immediately before the hearing that the stop work order was not really a stop work order at all.”

Jackson opens her opinion with quotes from Musk (the public face of DOGE), Vought, and President Donald Trump about their alleged intentions to eliminate the agency. For instance, Musk tweeted “CFPB RIP” on February 7th. “The CFPB has been a woke and weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,” Vought said the following day. A couple days later, Trump added, “That was a very important thing to get rid of.”

Essentially, the CFPB can — for now — get back to work

Jackson came to the conclusion that unless she takes action, “the RIF [reduction-in-force] notices that have already been prepared will go out before the ink is dry on the Court’s signature, the employees will be back on administrative leave for just thirty days before they are gone, and the defendants will pull the plug on the CFPB.” While this isn’t a final ruling, as part of issuing the injunction, Jackson says the workers’ union is likely to ultimately succeed in court on its claims.

The judge orders the Trump administration to reinstate all probationary and term employees terminated since February 10th, carry out no further terminations without cause or issue any RIF notice, lift the administrative leave requirements and stop-work order, and let employees either return to an office or work remotely. She also requires that the government maintain CFPB data and records, and rescind contract termination notices sent since February 11th. Essentially, the CFPB can — for now — get back to work.",theverge
https://theverge.com,Windows 11 is closing a loophole that let you skip making a Microsoft account,https://theverge.com/news/638967/microsoft-windows-11-account-internet-bypass-blocked,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 22:04:46 GMT","is a news writer fond of the electric vehicle lifestyle and things that plug in via USB-C. He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.

Microsoft is no longer playing around when it comes to requiring every Windows 11 device be set up with an internet-connected account. In its latest Windows 11 Insider Preview, the company says it will take out a well-known bypass script that let end users skip the requirement of connecting to the internet and logging in with a Microsoft account to get through the initialization process of a new PC.

As reported by Windows Central, Microsoft already requires users to connect to the internet, but there’s a way to bypass it: the bypassnro command. For those setting up computers for businesses or secondary users, or simply, on principle refuse to link their computer to a Microsoft account, the command is super simple to activate during the Windows setup process.

Microsoft cites security as one reason it’s making this change:

We’re removing the bypassnro.cmd script from the build to enhance security and user experience of Windows 11. This change ensures that all users exit setup with internet connectivity and a Microsoft Account.

Since the bypassnro command is disabled in the latest beta build, it will likely be pushed to production versions within weeks. All hope is not yet lost, as of right now the script can be reactivated with a registry edit by opening a command prompt during the initial setup (Press Shift + F10) and running the command:

reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\OOBE /v BypassNRO /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f shutdown /r /t 0”

However, there’s no guarantee Microsoft will allow this additional workaround for long. There are other workarounds as well, such as using the unattended.xml automation that lets you skip the initial setup “out-of-box experience.” It’s not straightforward, though, but it makes more sense for IT departments setting up multiple computers.

As of late, Microsoft has been making it harder for people to upgrade to Windows 11 while also nudging them to move on from Windows 10, which will lose support in October. The company is cracking down on the ability to install Windows 11 on older PCs that don’t support TPM 2.0, and hounding you with full-screen ads to buy a new PC. Microsoft even removed the ability to install Windows 11 with old product keys.",theverge

Microsoft is starting to test Quick Machine Recovery, a feature designed to prevent incidents like last year’s Crowdstrike catastrophe. It’s rolling out in its latest Windows Insider Preview build (6120.3653) and allows IT professionals to remotely recover Windows 11 devices even if they won’t boot.

Microsoft first announced Quick Machine Recovery last year as part of its Windows Resiliency Initiative, which came in direct response to the Crowdstrike outage. Last July, Crowdstrike rolled out a faulty kernel-level update that caused the Blue Screen of Death to appear across millions of Windows devices, impacting banks, airlines, TV broadcasters, and more. IT admins struggled to quickly get them back online because many needed physical access to the machines to issue a fix.

But Quick Machine Recovery should at least help prevent similar outages. It prompts a device to enter the Windows Recovery Environment, where the machine can access the network and provide Microsoft with diagnostic information. Microsoft can then remotely deploy fixes via the Windows Update system.

The feature is enabled by default for home users, and Windows Insiders can try it out now using a simulated environment.",theverge

Coastal communities depend on fishing for sustenance and income, but sudden storms can endanger those at sea and their fishing boats. Seeking to help people answer these questions, teams at Google have been working on AI powered nowcasting for years, helping our users to understand exactly when and where they should expect precipitation over the next few hours.

Now, these short-term precipitation forecasts are being made available across Africa, for the first time. The forecasts are made possible through advancements in Google Research's AI-powered nowcasting model MetNet, which uses satellite data and ground observations to produce state-of-the-art precipitation forecasts in data-sparse regions of the world. Google’s technology can predict global precipitation with high accuracy within a 5km radius every 15 minutes for the next 12 hours — all under one minute.

Solving the problem of sparse ground observations

One critical component for weather forecasts is dense ground radar, which is not available for the majority of the world where billions of people live. The need for new approaches and better weather forecasts is especially pronounced in Africa, where ground observations are limited and global weather models tend to exhibit low skill. For example, North America has 291 radar facilities to track weather, while Africa has 37.

To scale nowcasting globally, our Research teams came up with an innovative new approach using globally available satellite observations in our nowcasting models.

Using AI and satellite observations, the model was able to fill in the gaps, even in areas where radar was unavailable, overcoming previous limitations in data sparse regions. It is also our first model to directly incorporate observations from a multitude of satellites.",theverge

https://theverge.com,The Trump administration could green-light deep-sea mining for the first time,https://theverge.com/news/638732/battery-mineral-deep-sea-mining-the-metals-company-donald-trump,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 20:55:24 GMT","is a senior science reporter covering energy and the environment with more than a decade of experience. She is also the host of Hell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home , a podcast from Vox Media and Audible Originals.

The company that has pushed to open up the deep sea for mining is cozying up to the Trump administration after years of hitting roadblocks in international negotiations.

The island nation of Nauru initially sponsored The Metals Company (TMC) and its deep-sea mining effort. In 2021, that triggered a race to develop regulations before TMC or any other company could begin harvesting minerals in international waters to be used in rechargeable batteries.

Panic quickly set in among many scientists, environmental groups, and policymakers worried about the consequences of mining the ocean’s abyss. The surface of the Moon is better mapped than the world’s seafloor, and researchers are still making stunning discoveries there that raise questions about the ripple effects mining could have on ocean ecosystems and the coastal communities that rely on them.

With President Donald Trump on a crusade to roll back environmental protections and “drill, baby, drill,” the US could prove to be a more powerful ally for TMC

Talks to develop rules for deep-sea mining are still underway at the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which was established by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Nauru and more than 160 other nations have ratified the convention, but the United States has not. And with President Donald Trump on a crusade to roll back environmental protections and “drill, baby, drill,” the US could prove to be a more powerful ally for TMC.

TMC announced yesterday that the company had “met with officials in the White House” and now plans to apply for permits under existing US mining code to begin extracting minerals from the high seas. “After extensive legal review and constructive engagement with [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)] and other officials across the U.S. government, we believe the United States offers a stable, transparent, and enforceable regulatory path,” TMC CEO Gerard Barron said in a press release yesterday.

The news sent shockwaves through ISA meetings taking place in Kingston, Jamaica, this month. It quickly elicited criticism from groups opposed to deep-sea mining that say TMC is attempting to circumvent a multilateral process.

“The Metals Company is crossing a dangerous line by flirting with a breach of international law and a disruption of multilateralism,” Emma Wilson, a policy officer at the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, said in a press statement.

The coalition, along with more than 30 countries, is pushing for a ban or moratorium on deep-sea mining until rules are in place to minimize the potential damage. Crafting those rules has been slow-going, in part because researchers say they need more time to study the deep sea to understand the risks.

Just last year, for instance, scientists published controversial evidence of “dark oxygen” rising from the abyssal seafloor. They still don’t know for sure how the oxygen is produced since oxygen is a product of photosynthesis, a process requiring sunlight. The paper, which was published in the journal Nature Geoscience, suggests that there’s a completely different and previously unknown process for producing oxygen, raising questions about how much life on Earth depends on that process and whether deep-sea mining might interfere with it. That research was initially funded in part by The Metals Company, which later repudiated the findings, claiming the scientists’ methods were “flawed.” Other mining companies and independent researchers have also cast doubt on the study.

Its authors hypothesized that polymetallic nodules rich in nickel, copper, cobalt, iron, and manganese that are strewn across the seafloor might be able to produce enough of an electrical charge to split seawater, releasing oxygen through electrolysis. Those nodules are exactly what TMC and other mining companies are eager to harvest to feed growing demand for the battery materials used in electric vehicles and rechargeable devices. Other recent studies have found that deep-sea mining could lead to “irreversible” damage and noise loud enough to make it difficult for whales and other sea creatures to communicate.

TMC says its own data shows that deep-sea mining would be less damaging than mining on land. In an email to The Verge, its CEO also says, “TMC remains fully compliant with international law.”

According to The New York Times, “drafts are now circulating of an executive order President Trump will be asked to sign” that would support mining in international waters on the basis that the US hasn’t ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Trump administration didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment from The Verge.

“States, civil society, scientists, companies, and Indigenous communities continue to resist these efforts,” Louisa Casson, senior campaigner for Greenpeace International, said in a press statement. “Having tried and failed to pressure the international community to meet their demands, this reckless announcement is a slap in the face to international cooperation.”",theverge

President Donald Trump granted pardons to three co-founders of the BitMEX global cryptocurrency exchange, as well as to a former high-ranking employee of the company, CNBC has learned.

The co-founders, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed, and former head of business development Gregory Dwyer, previously pled guilty to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act related to failure to maintain anti-money laundering and know-your-customer programs.

The founders received criminal sentences of probation of varying lengths and were ordered to pay civil fines totaling $30 million related to a lawsuit by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Dwyer, who received a sentence of 18 months of probation, agreed to pay $150,000 in fines.

Prosecutors accused the men of effectively operating BitMEX as a ""money laundering platform"" and that its purported withdrawal from the U.S. market was ""a sham.""

Trump issued the pardons on Thursday, more than three months after BitMEX was sentenced to pay a fine of $100 million for violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to establish and maintain anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer programs.

Hayes, in a tweet on Friday, wrote, ""Thank you POTUS,"" using the term for ""President of the United States.""

Delo, in a statement, said, ""The US Department of Justice wrongfully targeted BitMEX and its co-founders.""

""This full and unconditional pardon by President Trump is a vindication of the position we have always held – that BitMEX, my co-founders and I should never have been charged with a criminal offense through an obscure, antiquated law,"" Delo said.

""As the most successful crypto exchange of its kind, we were wrongfully made to serve as an example, sacrificed for political reasons and used to send inconsistent regulatory signals.""

""I'm sincerely grateful to the President for granting this pardon to me and my co-founders,"" Delo said. ""A legal wrong has been righted today and despite the distress I have been through over the past few years I'm pleased to have cleared my name and to be able to continue my life and philanthropic work without the burden of an unfounded conviction.""

Hayes, Delo and Reed founded BitMEX in 2014. Prosecutors said the executives knew that the exchange was required to implement an anti-money laundering plan because it served U.S. customers ""but chose to flout those requirements, requiring only that customers provide an email address to use BitMEX's services.""

""Indeed, senior executives each knew that customers residing in the U.S. continued to access BitMEX's trading platform through at least in or about 2018, and that BitMEX policies nominally in place to prevent such trading were toothless or easily overridden to serve BitMEX's bottom line goal of obtaining revenue through the U.S. market without regard to U.S. criminal laws,"" the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement in January.

Delo, the former chief operating officer and chief strategy officer of BitMEX, had been sentenced to 30 months of probation after his guilty plea in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

Hayes was sentenced to six months of home confinement, followed by two years of probation.

Reed, who is the exchange's former chief technology officer, was sentenced to 18 months of probation.

Trevor Milton, the founder and former CEO of electric truck maker Nikola, revealed Thursday night that Trump had pardoned him for his criminal conviction for securities fraud. Milton had been sentenced to four years in prison in that case, but remained free on appeal.",theverge
https://theverge.com,Side Quest’s creators wanted to tell stories about why people love games,https://theverge.com/tv/638323/apple-tv-plus-side-quest-ashly-burch-john-howell-harris-katie-mcelhenney,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 19:50:00 GMT","is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.

Halfway through its first season, Apple’s Mythic Quest threw a wild curveball with “A Dark Quiet Death” — an unexpectedly dramatic episode that chronicled the rise and fall of another video game development team. “A Dark Quiet Death” was the first instance of Mythic Quest switching up its comedic formula to tell an earnest story about what makes people fall in love with games. And since then, every season of Mythic Quest has featured a backstory episode that felt emblematic of the series’ narrative strengths.

Side Quest, Apple TV Plus’ new Mythic Quest spinoff miniseries, feels a lot like a collection of “A Dark Quiet Death”-style episodes as it introduces a slew of new characters (and brings back a couple of veterans) whose lives have all been touched by one of the world’s most popular games. When I recently spoke with Side Quest’s co-creators, Ashly Burch, John Howell Harris, and Katie McElhenney, they told me that the new show’s stylistic similarities to Mythic Quest’s forays into the past were entirely intentional. But after years of focusing on characters who see themselves as larger-than-life gods, the Side Quest team was much more interested in telling stories about the players who made Mythic Quest a hit.

“When we first started writing Mythic Quest, we talked about how these characters are sort of like gods who are creating this virtual world,” Burch said. “So if the people within Mythic Quest HQ are the gods, then Side Quest is about the mortals that are being affected by the choices of the gods.”

Side Quest wanders further and further away from Ian Grimm (Rob McElhenney) and everyone else working at Mythic Quest Studios over the course of its four-episode-long season. But the series actually kicks off with an episode revolving around the game’s art director, Phil Birch (Derek Waters), as he tries to make some time for a vacation with his girlfriend Maude (Anna Konkle). Even though working directly on Mythic Quest (the game) might make its fans see Phil as one of the game’s gods, Burch felt that his history of being exploited by his colleagues made him the perfect mortal to open the show.

“We wanted to lead with a transitional landing pad between Mythic Quest prime and Side Quest, and we thought that Phil, bless him, is a very good encapsulation of the choices Mythic Quest’s main characters have been making,” Burch explained. “From seasons 2–3, Phil is probably treated like the office toilet more than any other character, and he’s just at the whims of these deranged creatives.”

All of Side Quest’s characters have some sort of relationship with Mythic Quest, but the co-creators saw the show as an opportunity to explore different kinds of audiences that can gravitate toward popular pieces of IP as they expand into different mediums. At this point in the game’s existence, Mythic Quest has been adapted into a hit comic series that stores like the one featured in “Pull List” can barely manage to keep in stock. And while Mythic Quest employees like Phil might be desperate to get away from the franchise, Harris noted that there are countless people who are desperate to become part of it, like the professional musicians featured in Side Quest’s Tár-like episode, “Fugue.”

“At one point, it was news to me that the music from games like Zelda and Final Fantasy goes on tour all around the world to be played by full orchestras in concert halls and theaters packed full of people,” Harris said. “I was fascinated by how popular these concerts are, but also the level of musicianship required to play at that level in such a competitive environment.”

Image: Apple

The season comes full circle in “The Last Raid,” an episode set almost entirely within Mythic Quest (the game), as a group of teens log on together hoping to take on some powerful bosses only to realize that their real-world friendships are running low on HP. Burch said “The Last Raid” was born, in part, out of the team’s love for classic machinima series like Red vs. Blue. But the idea of taking viewers inside of Mythic Quest also struck them as the perfect way to illustrate how both the game and the larger brand have transformed in response to what’s been going on behind the scenes.

“Part of what’s interesting about ‘The Last Raid’ is the way you kind of see that Mythic Quest, the game, is changing because the brand is also expanding,” McElhenney said. “It almost feels like this group of kids is playing a throwback version of Mythic Quest. World of Warcraft is a good analogue because it’s a similar situation where you have a game that has a rabid fan base of people who are loyal to it even though it’s not necessarily being updated and maintained.”

Though Side Quest drops a couple of hints about how Mythic Quest might change after its season 4 finale, the team’s biggest goal with the spinoff was to leave viewers guessing about which kinds of new perspectives they’d be seeing this world from next. And that meant leaning into the tonal flexibility the original series has become known for by veering off the beaten path.

“I feel like that’s how it was with Mythic Quest’s departure episodes — especially in season 1 when no one was expecting them,” McElhenney said. “Shows just don’t do that kind of thing usually, but because Mythic Quest prime was able to take that leap, we had more creative freedom with Side Quest to embrace the anthology model and make every episode feel completely different.”",theverge

By exploiting a model's inability to distinguish between, on the one hand, developer-defined prompts and, on the other, text in external content LLMs interact with, indirect prompt injections are remarkably effective at invoking harmful or otherwise unintended actions. Examples include divulging end users’ confidential contacts or emails and delivering falsified answers that have the potential to corrupt the integrity of important calculations.

Despite the power of prompt injections, attackers face a fundamental challenge in using them: The inner workings of so-called closed-weights models such as GPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini are closely held secrets. Developers of such proprietary platforms tightly restrict access to the underlying code and training data that make them work and, in the process, make them black boxes to external users. As a result, devising working prompt injections requires labor- and time-intensive trial and error through redundant manual effort.

Algorithmically generated hacks

For the first time, academic researchers have devised a means to create computer-generated prompt injections against Gemini that have much higher success rates than manually crafted ones. The new method abuses fine-tuning, a feature offered by some closed-weights models for training them to work on large amounts of private or specialized data, such as a law firm’s legal case files, patient files or research managed by a medical facility, or architectural blueprints. Google makes its fine-tuning for Gemini’s API available free of charge.

The new technique, which remained viable at the time this post went live, provides an algorithm for discrete optimization of working prompt injections. Discrete optimization is an approach for finding an efficient solution out of a large number of possibilities in a computationally efficient way. Discrete optimization-based prompt injections are common for open-weights models, but the only known one for a closed-weights model was an attack involving what's known as Logits Bias that worked against GPT-3.5. OpenAI closed that hole following the December publication of a research paper that revealed the vulnerability.",arstechnica

New research peers under the hood.,https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/why-do-llms-make-stuff-up-new-research-peers-under-the-hood/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 22:33:51 GMT","One of the most frustrating things about using a large language model is dealing with its tendency to confabulate information, hallucinating answers that are not supported by its training data. From a human perspective, it can be hard to understand why these models don't simply say ""I don't know"" instead of making up some plausible-sounding nonsense.

Now, new research from Anthropic is exposing at least some of the inner neural network ""circuitry"" that helps an LLM decide when to take a stab at a (perhaps hallucinated) response versus when to refuse an answer in the first place. While human understanding of this internal LLM ""decision"" process is still rough, this kind of research could lead to better overall solutions for the AI confabulation problem.

When a “known entity” isn't

In a groundbreaking paper last May, Anthropic used a system of sparse auto-encoders to help illuminate the groups of artificial neurons that are activated when the Claude LLM encounters internal concepts ranging from ""Golden Gate Bridge"" to ""programming errors"" (Anthropic calls these groupings ""features,"" as we will in the remainder of this piece). Anthropic's newly published research this week expands on that previous work by tracing how these features can affect other neuron groups that represent computational decision ""circuits"" Claude follows in crafting its response.

In a pair of papers, Anthropic goes into great detail on how a partial examination of some of these internal neuron circuits provides new insight into how Claude ""thinks"" in multiple languages, how it can be fooled by certain jailbreak techniques, and even whether its ballyhooed ""chain of thought"" explanations are accurate. But the section describing Claude's ""entity recognition and hallucination"" process provided one of the most detailed explanations of a complicated problem that we've seen.

At their core, large language models are designed to take a string of text and predict the text that is likely to follow—a design that has led some to deride the whole endeavor as ""glorified auto-complete.""

https://arstechnica.com,Beyond RGB: A new image file format efficiently stores invisible light data,https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/scientists-are-storing-light-we-cannot-see-in-formats-meant-for-human-eyes/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 22:11:00 GMT","Imagine working with special cameras that capture light your eyes can't even see—ultraviolet rays that cause sunburn, infrared heat signatures that reveal hidden writing, or specific wavelengths that plants use for photosynthesis. Or perhaps using a special camera designed to distinguish the subtle visible differences that make paint colors appear just right under specific lighting. Scientists and engineers do this every day, and they're drowning in the resulting data.

A new compression format called Spectral JPEG XL might finally solve this growing problem in scientific visualization and computer graphics. Researchers Alban Fichet and Christoph Peters of Intel Corporation detailed the format in a recent paper published in the Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques (JCGT). It tackles a serious bottleneck for industries working with these specialized images. These spectral files can contain 30, 100, or more data points per pixel, causing file sizes to balloon into multi-gigabyte territory—making them unwieldy to store and analyze.

When we think of digital images, we typically imagine files that store just three colors: red, green, and blue (RGB). This works well for everyday photos, but capturing the true color and behavior of light requires much more detail. Spectral images aim for this higher fidelity by recording light's intensity not just in broad RGB categories, but across dozens or even hundreds of narrow, specific wavelength bands. This detailed information primarily spans the visible spectrum and often extends into near-infrared and near-ultraviolet regions crucial for simulating how materials interact with light accurately.

Unlike standard RGB images with their three channels, these files store information across numerous channels, each representing the intensity of light within a very specific, narrow band of wavelengths. The paper discusses working with spectral images containing 31 distinct channels and even shows examples with as many as 81 spectral bands.

These channels often need to capture a much wider range of brightness values than typical photos. To handle this, spectral images frequently use high-precision formats like 16-bit or 32-bit floating-point numbers for each channel, enabling High Dynamic Range (HDR) data capture. This is a far cry from standard 8-bit images and is key for accurately representing things like the intense brightness of light sources alongside darker scene elements.",arstechnica

By this time in March 2024, the NIH had awarded US researchers a total of $1.027 billion for new grants or competitive grant renewals. This year, the figure currently stands at about $400 million. Likewise, funding for renewals of existing grants without competition reached $4.5 billion by this time last year, but has only hit $2 billion this year. Together, this slowdown amounts to a 60 percent drop in grant support for a wide variety of research—from studies on cancer treatments, diabetes, Alzheimer's, vaccines, mental health, transgender health, and more.

The NIH is the primary source of funding for biomedical research in the US. NIH grants support more than 300,000 scientists at more than 2,500 universities, medical schools, and other research organizations across all 50 states.

In the near term, the missing grant money means clinical trials have been abruptly halted, scientific projects are being shelved, supplies can't be purchased, and experiments can't be run. But, in the long run, it means a delay in scientific advancements and treatment, which could echo across future generations. With funding in question, academic researchers may be unable to retain staff or train younger scientists.",arstechnica

The most recent data breach report, published Friday by Bleeping Computer, said that Oracle Health—a health care software-as-a-service business the company acquired in 2022—had learned in February that a threat actor accessed one of its servers and made off with patient data from US hospitals. Bleeping Computer said Oracle Health customers have received breach notifications that were printed on plain paper rather than official Oracle letterhead and were signed by Seema Verma, the executive vice president & GM of Oracle Health.

The other report of a data breach occurred eight days ago, when an anonymous person using the handle rose87168 published a sampling of what they said were 6 million records of authentication data belonging to Oracle Cloud customers. Rose87168 told Bleeping Computer that they had acquired the data a little more than a month earlier after exploiting a vulnerability that gave access to an Oracle Cloud server.

Researchers at outside security firms who have reviewed data provided by rose87168 said it appeared to be genuine. Cloudsek researchers said the firm “assesses this threat with medium confidence and rates it as High in severity.” In all, they said, more than 140,000 tenants—meaning customers using Oracle Cloud services—were affected.",arstechnica

The company has just announced two of its home gadgets will be discontinued, one of which is quite popular. The Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide detector is a common fixture in homes, but Google says it has stopped manufacturing it. The less popular Nest x Yale smart lock is also getting the ax. There are replacements coming, but Google won't be making them.

Nest launched the 2nd gen Protect a year before it became part of Google. Like all smoke detectors, the Nest Protect comes with an expiration date. You're supposed to swap them out every 10 years, so some Nest users are already there. You will have to hurry if you want a new Protect. While they're in stock for the moment, Google won't manufacture any more. It's on sale for $119 on the Google Store for the time being.

The group criticizing current Chairman Brendan Carr includes Republican Alfred Sikes, the FCC chair from 1989 to 1993, and Democrat Tom Wheeler, the FCC chair from 2013 to 2017. They were joined by Republican Rachelle Chong, Democrat Ervin Duggan, and Democrat Gloria Tristani, all former commissioners.

""These comments are submitted to emphasize the unprecedented nature of this news distortion proceeding, and to express our strong concern that the Federal Communications Commission may be seeking to censor the news media in a manner antithetical to the First Amendment,"" the former chairs and commissioners told the FCC in a filing this week.

The Center for American Rights filed the news distortion complaint against flagship station WCBS over the editing of a CBS 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. The complaint was dismissed in January by then-Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel. Carr, Trump's pick to lead the FCC, revived the complaint shortly after taking over.

“Editorial judgment protected by First Amendment”

The Center for American Rights' claim of news distortion is based on an allegation that CBS misled viewers by airing two different responses from Harris to the same question about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, one on 60 Minutes and the other on Face the Nation. But CBS provided the FCC with a transcript showing that the programs aired two different sentences from the same response.

""The transcript confirms that the editing choices at issue lie well within the editorial judgment protected by the First Amendment and that the Commission's January 16 dismissal of the complaint was legally correct,"" the former chairs and commissioners wrote. ""Yet the Commission has reopened the complaint and taken the highly unusual step of inviting public comment, even though the proceeding is adjudicatory in nature. These developments have unjustifiably prolonged this investigation and raise questions about the actual purpose of the proceeding.""

The FCC has historically punished licensees only after dramatic violations, like ""elaborate hoaxes, internal conspiracies, and reports conjured from whole cloth,"" they wrote. There is ""no credible argument"" that the allegations against CBS ""belong in the same category.""",arstechnica

In an update this week, the US space agency said it is still working through the process to certify Starliner for human missions. Whether it carries cargo or humans, Starliner's next flight will not occur until late this year or, more likely, sometime in 2026.

Two things stand out in the new information provided by NASA. First, there remains a lot of work left to do this year before Starliner will fly again, including extensive testing of the vehicle's propulsion system. And secondly, it is becoming clear that Starliner will only ever fly a handful of missions to the space station, if that, before the orbiting laboratory is retired.

Long line of tests

Several issues marred Starliner's first crew flight to the space station last June, but the most serious of these was the failure of multiple maneuvering thrusters. Concerns about these thrusters prompted NASA to fly Starliner's crew, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, home on a Crew Dragon vehicle instead. They safely landed earlier this month.

Starliner returned autonomously in early September. Since then, NASA and Boeing have been reviewing data from the test flight. (Unfortunately, the errant thrusters were located on the service module of the spacecraft, which is jettisoned before reentry and was not recovered.)

Although engineers from NASA and Boeing have worked through more than 70 percent of the observations and anomalies that occurred during Starliner's flight, the propulsion system issues remain unresolved.",arstechnica

It's a real problem, especially if you have butter fingers. Gorilla Glass maker Corning has announced a new material that might help save the day the next time you drop a phone. The company claims its latest Gorilla Glass Ceramic can withstand drops that would shatter lesser materials.

As the name implies, Corning's new glass incorporates ceramic components to improve strength compared to other types of hardened glass. Corning has offered a bit of data to support this claim. In its lab tests (PDF), Gorilla Glass Ceramic withstood 10 drops from one meter onto surfaces that closely resemble asphalt. Why Corning does not use real asphalt for this test is unclear. Regardless, the company says an unspecified ""competitive"" type of aluminosilicate glass would typically fail on the first drop.

Chemically strengthened glass has been a key component in the proliferation of smartphones across the world. Since the company provided the glass for that first iPhone back in 2007, it has made glass for more than 7 billion devices. That makes Corning the largest glass supplier in the mobile industry, but it does face increasing competition in the budget and midrange segments.

Corning does not directly compare Gorilla Glass Ceramic to the popular Gorilla Glass Victus 2, which was, until now, its most durable offering. That material can allegedly survive drops onto similarly rough surfaces, but the company doesn't specify a number like it does with the new ceramic version. Corning also has its Gorilla Glass Armor series, which has been used on the last few generations of Samsung Galaxy Ultra flagships.

Upset by exhibits that reference the role of racism, sexism, and more in the nation's complicated past, the order tasks the vice president and a former insurance lawyer (?) with ensuring that the Smithsonian Institution is a ""symbol of inspiration and American greatness""—a command that specifically includes the National Zoo.

But in the process of airing the administration's grievances, the document specifically calls out a Smithsonian display for accurately describing our current scientific understanding of race. That raises the prospect that the vice president will ultimately demand that the Smithsonian display scientifically inaccurate information.

Grievance vs. science

The executive order, entitled ""Restoring Truth And Sanity To American History,"" is filled with what has become a standard grievance: the accusation that, by recognizing the many cases where the US has not lived up to its founding ideals, institutions are attempting to ""rewrite our nation's history."" It specifically calls out discussions of historic racism, sexism, and oppression as undercutting the US's ""unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness.""

Even if you move past the obvious tension between a legacy of advancing liberty and the perpetuation of slavery in the US's founding documents, there are other ironies here. For example, the order slams the Department of the Interior's role in implementing changes that ""inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures"" at the same time that the administration's policies have led to the removal of references to transgender individuals and minorities and women.",arstechnica

Now, Nintendo-watchers are pointing to a fleeting mention of ""Switch 2 Edition games"" as a major hint that such enhancements are in the works for at least some original Switch games.

The completely new reference to ""Switch 2 Edition games"" comes from a Nintendo webpage discussing yesterday's newly announced Virtual Game Cards digital lending feature. In the fine print at the bottom of that page, Nintendo notes that ""Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system [emphasis added].""

The specific wording differentiating these ""Switch 2 Edition"" games from ""Switch 2 exclusives"" suggests a new category of game that is compatible with the original Switch but able to run with enhancements on the Switch 2. But it's currently unclear what Switch games will get ""Switch 2 Edition"" releases or how much developer work (if any) will be needed to create those new versions.

We’ve seen this before

Nintendo is no stranger to the idea of single game releases that work differently across different hardware. Back in the days of the Game Boy Color, developers could create special ""Dual Mode"" cartridges that ran in full color on the newer handheld or in regular grayscale on the original Game Boy.

I think, if I were coming into this having not read the books, the most puzzling bits might have been what’s going on in the White Tower this episode, with the who-is-the-darkfriend hide-n-seek game the Aes Sedai are playing.

I was a little taken aback at the casualness with which Elaida takes lives—her execution of Black Ajah sister Amico Nagoyin was pretty off-handed. I don’t recall her being quite that blasé about death in the books, but it has been a while. Regardless, while she’s not capital-E EEEEEVIL, she’s clearly not a good person. We do get our first glimpse of the Sea Folk, though it felt a bit ham-fisted—like they spent both more time than they needed to tee them up, and much less time than was needed to actually establish WTF this new group of people is. (Though I guess the name “Sea Folk” is pretty explanatory—it does what it says on the tin, as it were.)

The show is also happy to just quickly kill tertiary or... sextiary (??) characters to streamline the story.

The show is also happy to just quickly kill tertiary or... sextiary (??) characters to streamline the story. There are lots of those to go around in the books. There's a lot of Aiel and Sea Folk stuff where the show is just kind of asking you to take things at face value, even if book-readers are aware of more depth. One of the big running plotlines in the book is that the White Tower has weakened itself by being too doctrinaire about the way it absorbs the channelers of other cultures, totally taking them away from their families and societies and subjecting them to all kinds of weird inflexible discipline. This is why there are so many Aiel and Sea Folk channelers running around that the White Tower doesn't know about, and the show has nodded toward it but hasn't had a lot of room to communicate the significance of it.

Lee: That’s a point that Alanna Sedai comments on in this episode, and the reason she’s in the Two Rivers: The Tower has been too selective, too closed-minded, and—somewhat ironically—too parochial in its approach to accepting and training channelers. Further, there’s some worry that by spending thousands of years finding and gentling (or executing) male channelers, humanity has begun to self-select channeling out of the gene pool. : That’s a point that Alanna Sedai comments on in this episode, and the reason she’s in the Two Rivers: The Tower has been too selective, too closed-minded, and—somewhat ironically—too parochial in its approach to accepting and training channelers.

Andrew: Rocks! It's all rocks. Which makes sense for a desert, I suppose. : Rocks! It's all rocks. Which makes sense for a desert, I suppose. The show does a solid job of showing us what day-to-day Aiel society looks like through just a handful of characters, including Rhuarc's other wife Lian and his granddaughter Alsera. It's an economy of storytelling that is forced upon the show by budget and low episode count but usually you don't feel it. We're also getting our very first look at the awe and discomfort that Rand is going to inspire, as the prophesied Aiel chief-of-chiefs. Clan leaders are already telling tales of him to their children. But not everyone is going to have an easy time accepting him, something we'll probably start to pick apart in future episodes. Alanna is definitely in the running for my favorite overhauled show character. She's visible from very early on as a background character and loose ally of the Two Rivers crew in the books, but the show is giving her more of a personality and a purpose, and a wider view than Book-Alanna (who was usually sulking somewhere about her inability to take any of the Two Rivers boys as a Warder, if memory serves). In the show she and her Warder Maksim are fleshed-out characters who are dealing with their relationship and the Last Battle in their own way, and it's fun to get something unexpected and new in amongst all of the ""how are they going to portray Book Event X"" stuff.

Lee: Book-Alanna by this point has made some... let’s call them questionable choices, and her reworking into someone a bit less deserving of being grabbed by the throat and choked is excellent. (Another character with a similar reworking is Faile, who so far I actually quite like and do not at all want to throttle!) : Book-Alanna by this point has made some... let’s call them questionable choices, and her reworking into someone a bit less deserving of being grabbed by the throat and choked is excellent. (Another character with a similar reworking is Faile, who so far I actually quite like and do not at all want to throttle!) I think you’ve hit upon the main overarching change from the books, bigger than all other changes: The show has made an effort to make these characters into people with relatable problems, rather than a pack of ill-tempered, nuance-deaf ding-dongs who make bad choices and then have to dig themselves out. Well, except maybe for Elayne. I do still kind of want to shake her a bit.

And she is right to be studying up on their destination and trying to respect the agreement they made with the Sea Folk when they came on board. She's just right in a way that makes you wish she wasn't, a personality type I think we've all run into at least once or twice in our own lives. : Yes!

In terms of Big Book Things that are happening, let's talk about Egwene briefly. Obviously she's beginning to hone her skills in the World of Dreams—Tel'aran'rhiod, which gives the episode its name—and she's already using it to facilitate faster communication between far-flung characters and to check in on her friends. Two other, minor things: We're starting to see Rand and Egwene drift apart romantically, something the books had already dispensed with by this point. And this was the first time I noted an Aiel referring to her as ""Egwene Sedai."" I assume this has already happened and this is just the first time I've noticed, but Egwene/Nynaeve/Elayne playing at being full Aes Sedai despite not being is a plot thread the books pull at a lot here in the middle of the series.

Lee: Right, I seem to remember the dissembling about Egwene’s Sedai-ishness resulting in some kind of extended spanking session, that being the punishment the Book Wise Ones (and the Book Aes Sedai) were most likely to hand out. I think the characters’ pretending to be full Sisters and all the wacky hijinks that ensue are being dispensed with, and I am pretty okay with that.

Andrew: That's the thing, I'm not sure the characters pretending to be full Sisters is being dispensed with. The show's just dropping breadcrumbs so that they're there later, if/when they want to make a Big Deal out of them. We'll see whether they make the time or not.

Lee: Regardless, Eggy’s growth into a dream-walker is fortunately not being dispensed with, and as in the books, she does a lot of things she’s not supposed to do (or at least not until she’s got more than a single afternoon’s worth of dreamwalker training under her belt). She sort of heeds the Wise Ones’ directive to stay out of Tel’aran’rhiod and instead just skips around between her various friends’ dreams, before finally landing in Rand’s, where she finds him having sexytimes with, uh oh, an actual-for-real Forsaken. Perhaps this is why one shouldn’t just barge into someone’s dreams uninvited! : Regardless, Eggy’s growth into a dream-walker is fortunately not being dispensed with, and as in the books, she does a lot of things she’s not supposed to do (or at least not until she’s got more than a single afternoon’s worth of dreamwalker training under her belt).

And on the subject of dreams—or at least visions—I think we’d be remiss if we didn’t check in on the continuing bro-adventures of Min and Mat (which my cousin described as “a lesbian and her gay best friend hanging out, and it’s unclear which is which”). The show once again takes the opportunity to remind us of Min’s visions—especially the one of Mat being hanged. Foreshadowing!

Andrew: Honestly of all the plotlines going on right now I'm the most curious to see how Elayne/Nynaeve/Mat/Min get along in Tanchico, just because these characters have gotten so many minor little tweaks that I find interesting. Mat and Min are more friendly, and their plots are more intertwined in the show than they were in the books, and having a version of Nynaeve and a version of Mat that don't openly dislike each other has a lot of fun story potential for me. : Honestly of all the plotlines going on right now I'm the most curious to see how Elayne/Nynaeve/Mat/Min get along in Tanchico, just because these characters have gotten so many minor little tweaks that I find interesting.

I am a little worried that we only have three episodes left, since we've got the party split up into four or five groups, and most of those groups already have little sub-groups inside of them who are doing their own thing. I do trust the show a lot at this point, but the splitting and re-splitting of plotlines is what eventually gets the books stuck in the mud, and we've already seen that dynamic play out on TV in, say, mid-to-late-series Game of Thrones. I just hope we can keep things snappy without making the show totally overwhelming, as it is already in danger of being sometimes.

Lee: I seem to remember the time in Tanchico stretching across several books, though I may be getting that mixed up with whatever the hell the characters do in Far Madding much later (that’s not really a spoiler, I don’t think—it’s just the name of another city-state where readers are forced to spend an interminable amount of time). I’m reasonably sure our crew will find what they need to find in Tanchico by season’s end, at least—and, if it follows the books, things’ll get a little spicy. : I seem to remember the time in Tanchico stretching across several books, though I may be getting that mixed up with whatever the hell the characters do in Far Madding much later (that’s not really a spoiler, I don’t think—it’s just the name of another city-state where readers are forced to spend an interminable amount of time). I’m reasonably sure our crew will find what they need to find in Tanchico by season’s end, at least—and, if it follows the books, things’ll get a little spicy. Let’s see—for closing points, the one I had on my notepad that I wanted to hit was that for me, this episode reinforces that this show is at its best when it focuses on its characters and lets them work. Episode four with Rhuidean was a rare epic hit; most of the times the show has attempted to reach for grandeur or epic-ness, it has missed. The cinematography falls flat, or the sets look like styrofoam and carelessness, or the editing fails to present a coherent through-line for the action, or the writing whiffs it. But up close, locked in a ship or sitting on a mountainside or hanging out in a blacksmith’s dream, the actors know what they’re doing, and they have begun consistently delivering.

Andrew: There are a whole lot of ""the crew spends a bunch of time in a city you've never seen before, accomplishing little-to-nothing"" plotlines I think you're conflating. Tanchico is a Book 4 thing, and it's also mostly resolved in Book 4; the interminable one you are probably thinking of is Ebou Dar, where characters spend three or four increasingly tedious books. Far Madding is later and at least has the benefit of being brief-ish.

Lee: Ahhh, yes, you are absolutely correct! My Randland mental map is a bit tattered these days. So many city-states. So many flags. So many import and export crops to keep track of.

Andrew: But yes I agree that there's usually at least something that goes a bit goofy when the show attempts spectacle. The big battle that ended the first season is probably the most egregious example, but I also remember the Horn of Valere moment in the season 2 finale as looking ""uh fine I guess."" But the talking parts are good! The smaller fights, including the cool Alanna-Whitecloak stuff we get in this episode, are all compelling. There's some crowd-fight stuff coming in the next few episodes, if we stick to Book 4 as our source material, so we'll see what the show does and doesn't manage to pull off. : But yes I agree that there's usually at least something that goes a bit goofy when the show attempts spectacle.

It remains a very dense show, which is what I think will keep it from ever achieving a Game of Thrones level of cultural currency. But I'm still having fun. Anything else you want to highlight? Shoes you're waiting to drop?

According to people familiar with the decisions, the iPhone maker is expected to be fined and ordered to revise its App Store rules, following an investigation into whether they prevent app developers from sending consumers to offers outside its platform.

Regulators will also close another investigation into Apple, which was focused on the company’s design of its web browser choice screen without any further sanctions.

Meta will also be fined and ordered to change its “pay or consent” model, which forces users to either consent to data tracking or pay a subscription fee for an ad-free experience of its products.

Under the DMA, companies can face penalties of up to 10 percent of their global turnover, which could result in billions of dollars for both companies.

But the European Commission is aiming for fines that fall far below that threshold, three officials said, as the bloc’s digital rule book is relatively new and the decisions could still be challenged in court.

The moves come as Brussels attempts to enforce the DMA, which was designed to curb tech giants’ dominance of the digital marketplace, while avoiding a direct clash with Washington.

The focus of the new commission, which took office in December, is also more on the compliance of Big Tech companies with the law than on potential high fines in the billions of Euros, officials said.",arstechnica

It's been interesting to watch how quickly European officials have embraced ensuring they have a space launch capability independent of other countries. A few years ago, European government satellites regularly launched on Russian Soyuz rockets, and more recently on SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets from the United States. Russia is now non grata in European government circles, and the Trump administration is widening the trans-Atlantic rift. European leaders have cited the Trump administration and its close association with Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, as prime reasons to support sovereign access to space, a capability currently offered only by Arianespace. If European nations can reform how they treat their commercial space companies, there's enough ambition, know-how, and money in Europe to foster a competitive launch industry.

Elon Musk announced Friday that his company xAI is buying X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, in an all-stock deal. The transaction values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, according to CNBC.

“xAI has acquired X in an all-stock transaction. The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt),” Musk tweeted Friday evening.

Musk purchased Twitter in October 2022 for about $44 billion, changing the name of the company to X, and founded xAI just five months later as an artificial intelligence company. Musk’s tweet announcing the sale called X the “real-time source of ground truth” for 600 million active users globally.

In reality, Musk’s changes to Twitter have transformed it into a hotbed of far-right extremism, where neo-Nazis and conspiracy theorists who were once banned—from Nick Fuentes to Alex Jones—have been welcomed back with open arms. Musk had previously said he wouldn’t reinstate Jones, who had been banned in 2018, but apparently changed his mind about a year after buying the site.

Musk clearly sees an opportunity for his social media company and AI companies to grow better together, perhaps because the X brand has become so toxic to normal people. Traffic at X reportedly plummeted after the 2024 presidential election.

“xAI and X’s futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach,” Musk’s tweet reads.

Musk’s tweet really tried to stress that his companies are all about “truth,” something contradicted by his frequent lies and obfuscations about his activities with DOGE. Just yesterday, Musk said that he was going to give people on Social Security more money, something he has absolutely no authority to do.

“The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge,” Musk’s tweet reads. “This will allow us to build a platform that doesn’t just reflect the world but actively accelerates human progress.”

Musk closed his tweet by using one of his favorite words, “hardcore,” to thank the staff at both companies.

“I would like to recognize the hardcore dedication of everyone at xAI and X that has brought us to this point. This is just the beginning. Thank you for your continued partnership and support,” Musk wrote.",gizmodo

The trend of using Open AI’s ChatGPT to create AI images in the distinctive style of Studio Ghibli probably should have ceased the moment the official White House X account hopped aboard. But there’s a new wrinkle in the story today, as one of the trend’s proponents posted a cease and desist notice they claimed to have received from Studio Ghibli representatives—which fellow social media users immediately called out as being as fake as the “art” that inspired it.

Along with the (fake) letter, X user teej used the platform to defend what they’d done, writing in part: “AI creators deserve protection, not punishment. Expression is sacred. Imagination is not illegal. If I have to be a martyr to prove that, so be it.”

It’s hard not to chuckle at this response to, let’s see, typing a prompt into a program so that it can create an AI image blatantly ripping off hours of hard work and creativity from actual human artists, including the great Hayao Miyazaki and his Ghibli team.

At this point, we can go ahead and add another fake to the growing pile: the persecution complex being felt by AI “creators” who realize now they did something that made a lot of people justifiably annoyed. Take responsibility for one’s own actions? This is 2025! We don’t do that anymore! Better point the finger at someone else, even if that other person is crafted from thin air!

While Studio Ghibli has yet to make a public statement about OpenAI cannibalizing its works, it’s hard not to read into remarks from a Gkids representative regarding the box-office success currently being enjoyed by Princess Mononoke, which hit IMAX theaters in a 4K restoration this week in honor of its 40th anniversary.

“In a time when technology tries to replicate humanity, we are thrilled that audiences value a theatrical experience that respects and celebrates Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli’s masterpiece in all its cinematic hand-drawn glory,” Chance Huskey, VP of distribution for Gkids, said in a statement quoted in Variety.

Hundreds of millions of years ago, mysterious life forms called Prototaxites towered toward the sky. Believed to be the first giant organisms to thrive on dry land, some species of Prototaxites grew up to 26 feet (8 meters) in height and resembled tree trunks composed of tiny interconnected tubes. Their position in the greater tree of life has been hotly debated for over a century and a half. New research suggests this is because Prototaxites don’t have a place in the tree of life as we know it—they belonged to a previously unknown branch.

Researchers from the United Kingdom analyzed the fossil remains of a Prototaxites species called Prototaxites taiti and concluded that Prototaxites likely belonged to a now-extinct lineage of multicellular terrestrial eukaryotes (organisms, including all animals and plants, whose cells contain a nucleus). Their work is detailed in a study posted to the preprint server bioRxiv, and hasn’t been peer-reviewed yet.

“We conducted an extensive re-examination of P. taiti, leading us to reject the most widely held hypothesis that Prototaxites was a Fungus,” the researchers, including Corentin Loron from The University of Edinburgh’s School of Physics and Astronomy, wrote in the study. A 2007 paper had previously suggested that Prototaxites was ancient fungi.

Loron and colleagues reached this conclusion by “contrasting the anatomy and molecular composition of Prototaxites with contemporary fungi from the 407-million-year-old Rhynie chert,” they added. The Rhynie chert is a sedimentary deposit in Scotland that has preserved significant fossil remains from the Early Devonian period (around 408 to 360 million years ago).

The comparison revealed that the “Prototaxites taiti was the largest organism in the Rhynie ecosystem and its anatomy was fundamentally distinct from all known extant or extinct fungi.” The researchers also did not find evidence of chitin or chitosan molecules in the cell walls of all extinct and current fungi groups known to science.

More broadly, the researchers documented three defining features of Prototaxites: large structures made of different tube-like components, compounds similar to lignin (the molecules that help give plants their rigidity), and a heterotrophic lifestyle (consuming other organisms for food).

“Based on this investigation we are unable to assign Prototaxites to any extant lineage, reinforcing its uniqueness,” they explained. “We conclude that the morphology and molecular fingerprint of P. taiti is clearly distinct from that of the fungi and other organisms preserved alongside it in the Rhynie chert, and we suggest that it is best considered a member of a previously undescribed, entirely extinct group of eukaryotes.”

All living organisms on Earth belong to one of three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, or Eukaryotes (also known as Eukarya). Bacteria and Archaea are single-celled microorganisms without a nucleus, while all multicellular organisms are classified as Eukaryotes. Eukaryotes are generally subdivided into four kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, and protists (basically a catch-all category for all eukaryotes that aren’t animals, plants, or fungi). The researchers’ conclusion seems to suggest the existence of a new kingdom of life, though they don’t explicitly mention that classification.

In other words, long forgotten kingdoms might not just be the stuff of fantasy novels.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,DOGE Plans to Rewrite Entire Social Security Codebase in Just ‘a Few Months’: Report,https://gizmodo.com/doge-plans-to-rewrite-entire-social-security-codebase-in-just-a-few-months-report-2000582062,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 18:32:27 GMT","Details are scarce, but this has the potential to be a disaster.

Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is planning to migrate the Social Security Administration’s computer systems from the COBOL programming language to something more modern, according to a new report from Wired. And while it’s not yet clear what Musk’s band of dipshits plans to do exactly, Wired reports they aim to do it within “a few months,” a laughably audacious timeline for such a task.

Everything from the code that issues Social Security numbers to the payment schedules are written in COBOL, which was created in the 1950s, but the DOGE team seems to believe it can make a snap transition with the help of artificial intelligence, according to Wired. The DOGE team has already been reportedly running highly sensitive government data through AI, as the Washington Post reported last month, so why not use it to cheat-code your way to a more modern programming language? The reason, of course is the risk of cascading failures during any rush-job that might mean missed payments or beneficiary information getting wiped from the system entirely.

As Wired notes, the Social Security Administration had actually planned on migrating away from COBOL under a more realistic five-year timespan in the late 2010s, but that effort was derailed by the covid-19 pandemic, which disrupted countless plans in 2020. More than 65 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, and any hiccups would be devastating for people who rely on the program to stay alive.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently told the All-In podcast that if Social Security checks didn’t go out one month, his mother-in-law “wouldn’t call and complain.” Lutnick claimed, “a fraudster makes the loudest noise,” suggesting that only people who are fraudulently receiving Social Security would be concerned about payments stopping.

Lutnick’s logic doesn’t hold water, obviously. Millions of people who’ve paid into Social Security their entire lives have a perfectly reasonable expectation that they’ll receive the money they were promised. And Lutnick’s mother-in-law hypothetically would get help from her billionaire son-in-law if she didn’t get her check any given month. Most Americans who rely on Social Security don’t have a hyper-rich relative to bail them out.

The Social Security overhaul by DOGE is being led by Steve Davis, according to Wired, who is often described in news reports as the real day-to-day leader of the pseudo-agency. Davis joined SpaceX in 2003 and went on to become the head of Musk’s Boring Company in 2018 before being brought to Twitter in 2022 and then running Musk’s political action committee America PAC during the 2024 presidential election. Davis is seen as extremely loyal to Musk, with another top lieutenant of the Musk empire, Jared Birchall, quoted as saying “If Elon asked Steve to jump out of a window, he would do it,” according to the 2024 book Character Limit.

Wired’s report doesn’t name any of its sources within the Social Security Administration, but the news outlet has been reliably reporting on some of the DOGE team’s most galling cuts since Musk started taking a chainsaw to the federal government. Musk, who’s previously called Social Security a “ponzi scheme,” was given enormous power by President Donald Trump to unilaterally cut anything he wants, a nakedly illegal powergrab that continues to this day, despite several court challenges. Congress has yet to properly challenge Musk’s meddling with their power of the purse, but there are rumblings that some Republicans may finally be growing a spine. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, for example, signed on to a letter Thursday objecting to the Trump regime withholding $2.9 billion of funding allocated by Congress.

Musk and several people from DOGE were interviewed on Fox News by Bret Baier on Thursday night in a rather transparent attempt to calm fears over their ongoing destruction of the government. One of the DOGE staff, Joe Gebbia, talked about digitizing the records for retirement in the government, something that makes sense if done responsibly. But the DOGE team seems to think the reason government systems are so antiquated are that nobody ever thought of updating them before. The real reasons are two-fold. First, it takes large sums of money to migrate systems properly without disruption, which brings us to the second reason: Any disruption means millions of people could see critical services upended.

The Fox News interview was at times incoherent, as Musk promised that people getting Social Security would get more money after he was done rooting around in the systems.

“In fact, what we’re doing will help their benefits,” Musk said. “Legitimate people, as a result of the work of DOGE, will receive more Social Security, not less. I want to emphasize that. As a result of the work of DOGE, legitimate recipients of Social Security will receive more money, not less money.”

Musk even said he wanted people to “check back” on his claim in the future.

The claim that people would be getting more money from Social Security in the future simply makes no sense, and it’s hard to figure out why he’d bother saying such a thing. Only Congress can tinker with how much money would be paid out to beneficiaries. But Musk’s many lies have rarely had any real consequences.

IT expert Waldo Jaquith, who used to work for the U.S. government’s 18F department (which was recently abolished), wrote on Bluesky that Musk’s plans for Social Security computer systems were a really bad idea. “This is profoundly stupid and will definitely fail, and it’s just a question of whether our social security system fails along with it,” Jaquith wrote.

Jaquith went on to explain that there didn’t appear to be any real reason for this rushed push away from COBOL, especially if people are getting their Social Security payments reliably and on-time right now, as they have for decades.

“I cannot think of a single legitimate reason for DOGE to perform such a modernization, especially on such a time scale. A lot of my work is around helping agencies triage how to deal with old systems. If the old system works, *leave it alone*! Start with stuff that’s broken!” Jaquith continued.

Jaquith speculated that the real goal in migrating to a new system was to “create a technical chokepoint for the flow of money to allow individuals or groups to be punished extralegally,” saying that it’s all likely just “a fig leaf covering the real goal of fascism.”

Protesters are expected at more than 200 Tesla locations around the world on Saturday as a peaceful show of force against Musk’s illegal power grab. But not all of the protests against Musk have been peaceful. Federal authorities charged a 36-year-old man in Nevada just yesterday for allegedly setting fire to multiple Tesla vehicles at a Collision Center in Las Vegas. That man has been charged with both state and federal crimes, with no less than Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel weighing in to say that Tesla dealerships will be defended against “terrorism” by the federal government.

“As promised, acts of violence and vandalism will not be tolerated, and today law enforcement personnel acted quickly to arrest an individual on charges including arson,” Patel said in a statement Thursday. “Under Attorney General Bondi’s leadership, we will continue to pursue these investigations with the full force of law and will bring to justice anyone responsible for these attacks.”",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,"The Team Behind Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow Looks Back on Kara’s Legacy, and Her Future",https://gizmodo.com/supergirl-woman-of-tomorrow-interview-tom-king-bilquis-evely-matheus-lopes-2000582142,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 23:05:22 GMT","Kara Zor-El has lived many lives across her long, occasionally strange comic book history, but arguably no book has been more important to her modern imagining than Woman of Tomorrow. When the smash-hit miniseries released in 2021 to critical acclaim, it quickly became the jumping-on-point recommendation for people who wanted to get the Supergirl experience, even with its uniquely sci-fi bent. And then everything changed again a few years later, when James Gunn nonchalantly dropped the book as one of the comics his new era of the DC movie universe was going to draw inspiration from.

Now, Woman of Tomorrow is consistently one of DC’s premiere trades—spurred in part by the anticipation for next year’s Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow movie, directed by Craig Gillespie and starring House of the Dragon breakout Milly Alcock as Kara. It’s an anticipation that has only grown further when it became clearer that the film isn’t just taking the book’s catchy title, but specifically drawing on its world and characters. Our first look at the film came ripped right out of one of its most famous panels, and key characters from the book—even characters that didn’t make the final cut—joined the cast. Woman of Tomorrow will be just the second movie in DC’s attempted re-do at this whole thing, and its vision is one explicitly guided by roots in the comics unlike anything we’ve seen announced so far.

Which is why when io9 visited the team behind the book—writer Tom King, penciller Bilquis Evely, and colorist Matheus Lopes—in London, England recently, fresh off a visit to the set of the now-filming adaptation, it was important to recognize not just the moment of Woman of Tomorrow‘s impending shoot even further into the stars, but just how far the dreams of its creative team have come in the last few years. A dream realized in one way: this transatlantic visit marked the first time the trio had actually met in person.

“For me it was nerve-wracking. Because we’ve been working together for five, almost six years—since 2020 I think,” King told io9 in a small corner of a quiet London restaurant. “If Mat and Bil, they met me and they’re like ‘oh my god that guy’s horrible’ in person… I’m just so desperate to keep seeing them in my inbox, and seeing just the transcendent heights they reach and how I can somehow contribute to that. It was mostly just nervousness at that.”

“So that’s why I completely disguised my personality! A little joke but it’s based on truth,” King continued. “I just admire what they do so much, and being in person with them was an absolute joy just to see this one.” It was a feeling, like one of the many about this book and this character, shared by Evely and Lopes.

“I was very nervous to meet [Tom],” Evely added. “But at the same time we worked for so long and I read your writing for so long and I feel like I met you. I feel like I’m your friend. To finally see you here, in this moment, to visit to the set. It’s a special moment.”

Lopes, meanwhile, came somewhat prepared. “I wasn’t as nervous because I’d watched a lot of podcasts to see what Tom was like,” the colorist said. “I felt like I knew him, besides from the scripts… it felt good.”

Woman of Tomorrow was an unlikely creative process for the trio. Work on the book began during the heights of the covid-19 pandemic, and not only were King, Evely, and Lopes separated by oceans and continents, not even communicating over video, but King had already mostly written what would become the scripts for the final series by the time Evely and Lopes were submitting pages for the first.

“I feel this is so beautiful and distinctive, and I have one superpower. I do so many things poorly, but I can do one thing well,” King jokingly reflected. “Which is I can I can picture in my head what a comic book is going to look like. It comes from wasting your youth reading too many comic books, and I definitely wasted my youth away. I could see in my head what [Bilquis] would do with it, so I just wrote the comic that I thought she’d create. And I was right. I mean it went above and beyond what I thought. That was the creative process: it was just writing the best story I could, and watching her draw it in my head, and watching her draw it in real life.”

“And that’s why we are so good together,” Evely added. “We’re together because he wrote what needs to be wrote, and I do my part. It’s a good match.” A match that has already proven to bear fruit beyond DC in their swords-and-sorcery series Helen of Wyndhorn at Dark Horse—and may yet bear further fruit, with King already working on ideas for his potential next collaboration with the artist.

It’s the energy of that collaborative potential that drew King, Evely, and Lopes to Supergirl in the first place. “I’ve always said from the beginning of my career that I’m not so interested in the characters I work on, more than the team I work with, and the collaborators,” King said of the early stages of what would become Woman of Tomorrow. “So it began with an editor I had worked on Mr. Miracle and Strange Adventures with, and I’m saying, ‘Is there something there that we can do another Mr. Miracle for,’ basically. I would start trying to do another Mr. Miracle. And they said Supergirl was available, so I said yeah, obviously incredible potential with her. And I think the next thing they said is the artists available to draw it. They had a list and the first one was Bilquis. I didn’t read another name after her. I thought they were joking. She’s willing to do Supergirl? And so I think it started with the artist, before the idea.”

“I talked to Steve Orlando, who was writing Supergirl, and I was said ‘She’s kind of generic. I don’t really know. She has the same values as Superman,'” King continued. “And he’s like ‘No no, she doesn’t have the same values as Superman because she’s been through something Superman hasn’t. She was alive on Krypton, she was 14. She saw her planet destroyed. She lived through a horrible event. She lived through three other horrible events, to watch her asteroid destroyed, and her parents die. And Superman was just a baby. He arrived into optimism and she arrived… she had been through something. She arrived having seen something destroyed. And it’s a completely different perspective on how to be up, up in the sky, with that burden on your back.”

But Kara wasn’t the only star of Woman of Tomorrow. Arguably, in some ways, she isn’t even the star. That comes in the form of Ruthye Marye Knoll, a young woman from an alien world Supergirl comes across while celebrating her 21st birthday (away from a yellow sun, so she can get appropriately soused, of course). Seeking the death of a mercenary who killed her father in cold blood, Ruthye becomes the heart of Kara’s journey in the book, and the core of its themes. “I wanted to sort of [do] an Odyssey-like plot. I’d written a book called Up in the Sky which is a very Odyssey plot—just going from planet to planet looking for a kidnapped girl. I wanted this to complement that book,” King added. “I was looking for an Odyssey plot and I sort of came with this idea of two people, one giving each other one giving the other the chance for revenge. In the beginning I thought Supergirl would be the younger of the two and I was actually going to put Lobo [ed. note: who will now appear in the cinematic version in some capacity, played by former Aquaman star Jason Momoa]. But it was my editor who switched it out, my editor Brittany [Holzherr], was like ‘Make Supergirl the veteran.’ So then I invented Ruthye, and we were off to the races.”

“When I first saw this pitch for the mini series, I somehow knew what to do,” Evely said of developing Ruthye’s design, and the world she came from. “It’s like I imagine my head, and I show you some image boards with some ideas with pretty much cosmic images, with a little piece of vibe. I try to create lines that evoke some good sensibility for the comics. So every detail in the panels, is like telling some how I see the history behind [Ruthye] as well. Pretty much my passion is the backgrounds, and her eyes, and the way she feels all in all these scenes.”

It’s an interesting contrast to Evely’s approach to designing Kara for the series. Unlike the new, fantastical sci-fi aesthetic of the rest of Woman of Tomorrow, Kara cuts a distinctly classical figure. “The way I draw her, it’s because she passed through a lot of things like in her life like Tom said,” Evely continued. “She is young, but at the same time I feel like she was very mature. I try to show it in the way she looks, in the way she stands, or even move in her hands—it’s very subtle but it’s making all the difference, because it’s very human. You can identify yourself in her.”

That passion Evely and Lopes alike felt in pushing something new in the DC cosmos—which has spent generations going under re-interpretation after re-interpretation—to give Woman of Tomorrow an aesthetic unlike anything DC was releasing at the time. “I was just finishing The Dreaming which was a very cosmic book, and I kind of brought with me the same kind of the same aesthetic for Supergirl,” Evely added. “Dreaming was a book where we could explore everything. I feel like in Supergirl we could do it even more, because we went through a lot of planets, and in every single case, you could create another world. It was kind of a fun way to explore the creativity and the imagination of what we could create.”

“The universe is a big place, and like Earth, I imagine there’s a lot of diversity—I wanted to every place in the book to feel especially different,” Lopes said of the psychedelic yet warm colorscape he envisioned for Woman of Tomorrow. “I made sure that little things would always stand out from what we have here in Earth. For a small example… there are no blue skies until the last issue. I made sure of that. There’s always some shade of green, or something like that, or a yellow. I don’t know if people noticed that very intentionally, but somehow I think that they get this—there are no blue skies, so when there’s aliens that are more humanlike, like Ruthye and Krem [the man who killed her father], I always tried to leave a little something different, like the color of the eyes. It’s pink eyes for Ruthye, purple eyes for Krem. I was looking for a diversity beyond Earth as well—different lighting, lights, different lights, different hues for nature.”

Evely and Lopes being on the same page, literally and aesthetically, for Woman of Tomorrow, was born out of their prior collaboration on The Dreaming. “Whatever project Bilquis was choosing [after Dreaming], I would go with her. It was just really exciting, when she picked Supergirl,” Lopes continued. “For Woman of Tomorrow, I did something that I don’t usually do and I would say it’s kind of breaking the world of comics: I chose the feel of the style for the comic before I read a lot of it, and saw a lot of it, because it was the pandemic. It was a rough time, for me and for the whole world. I was trying to do some more colorful work. I don’t know why, but it was me trying to bring some color into a dark time. So even before Supergirl, I was like ‘No, I’m gonna make this a very bright vibrant world and universe.’ And it fits perfectly.”

“I think that’s a little of the magic of the art. Tom was in a headspace. Bilquis and I were in a headspace. And that combined, in that moment of time, was what created Supergirl.” Lopes continued. “It was really something out of chance. I just wanted to compliment the page.”

But that headspace also informed Woman of Tomorrow‘s darker bent, too. The undercurrent of the book, driven through Ruthye’s desire to seek vengeance for her father’s murder, is a reckoning with the act of violence itself, as Krem cuts a bloody path across the stars to avoid Supergirl and Ruthye alike. The balance between the cosmic awe of the series’ aesthetic, and that dark heart, was something Evely reflected through her own feelings while she was working on the series. “Something I always try to add in my work is that a sense of comfort, somehow, even when it’s a darker place or a sad environment—you can see still beauty in that, and for me, it’s a kind of comfort while I was working on this book,” Evely said. “I was like everyone at the time, very stressed. I had come from another project, had worked a lot, and through three years straight I was very tired and stressed, almost burnout. With Supergirl I was in the middle of understanding what it is I wanted to do. I always loved to work on comics. I always liked to draw, but at some point, in this case when I was starting Supergirl I was like, ‘Do I even like drawing?’ Because I was so stressed.

“But the book, and the image we were creating, was so special. I saw the first pages colored by [Matheus], and through that whole process, I got to enjoy my own work and discover my own style again, somehow. I think it shows on the page, and it shows a kind of discomfort through the story we were telling.”

That was something that reflected in what had drawn King to Supergirl in the first place: the tragedies that she had worked through and overcome, to become the person Kara is as we know her today. “One of the interesting things about Kara was that one of her original creators, Otto Binder, created her as a dedication to his daughter. He created two characters as a dedication to her—Kara and Ms. Marvel from the Captain Marvel family. But soon after he created Supergirl, his daughter tragically died,” King said. “He spent the rest of his life haunted, it ruined him, destroyed him as a man and a creator, and I always felt… I don’t know, some transference, like that character has a little bit of that ghost in it. That little bit of haunting, a little bit of her that’s not like Superman.”

“There’s something there because she’s been through tragedy. She’s been through Krypton, her actual origins come from tragedy and how that changes a person. How it makes them a little tougher, a little more more cynical, a little more open-eyed towards the world,” King continued. “But also a little stronger. A little more powerful and compassionate, because they’ve actually seen the other side of it. They’ve seen the pain that they’re saving people from. That was the idea that I wanted to push. That sounds like a very complicated way of what I’m trying to say, which is to make her a badass and put a little bit of Wolverine in her. That cool, rebel character that I always loved growing up.”

It’s clear that the team’s vision for Supergirl resonated beyond just comic critics. In January 2023, James Gunn and Peter Safran revealed that one of the first films in their ambitious slate for a revived DC movie universe would be Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, specifically drawing on the book’s interpretation of Kara’s struggles. For the team behind the book—especially as trade collections began selling out just from Gunn’s mention—the news came out of nowhere.

“When the news about the film came out, it was so great, because I knew people would turn to the comic,” Evely said.

“That the announcement happened was very shocking. We were in Brazil, figuring out the next steps,” Lopes added. “After a while, it becomes so distant. Now it’s finally becoming real to us, visiting the set. Things are as real as they can get. It was something so far away, and now it’s really close, I love it.”

“It’s real but it’s still surreal. Because it’s so crazy,” Evely continued. “I felt a great sense of comfort [visiting the set], because we saw how hard such talented people were working on this movie. We gave all of our hearts to it in the book, so it’s really nice to see that they are giving their hearts to the movie.”

King already had some experience working in the realm of DC film—he had previously worked with Ava DuVernay on the since-cancelled New Gods film, and in the new era of DC beyond Supergirl, he had worked in early phases of the Lanterns TV show. But that didn’t change how seeing Woman of Tomorrow be part of that vision felt. “I mean, I try to be as cynical as I can about everything—mostly to keep up with my children so we can be on the same vibe,” King joked. “When they first showed us the scope of it, I literally… tears in my eyes. I was trying to play cool, because there are a lot of producers and people I wanted to look tough with. Bilquis and Matheus are there. So I’d subtly wipe away my tears. If anyone asks: I was cool and chill.”

“Not to name drop, but to defer to someone who understands this better than I do. I was hanging out with Brian Michael Bendis at a con–everywhere Bendis goes, people come up to him because of Miles Morales, the impact that he had on culture on the world. They get pictures with him, and after we’re walking the hall, he gets stopped like seven times,” King continued. “And I felt like every time he turned to me he was just like ‘Miles is just a gift. It’s just a gift. It’s like walking around with a gift all day.’ That’s how Supergirl feels. It’s just like a gift, it’s wonderful.”

And with that gift, there’s a peculiar sense of ownership Woman of Tomorrow‘s team can have over this specific vision of the character. They don’t own Supergirl, of course, but Woman of Tomorrow is their Supergirl. “I feel like the way she presents herself is something we created,” Evely reflected. “The way she conducts, and, speaks, and looks, I feel this is from us. I like to think that maybe the other people remember her like that.”

“Putting aside the ownership and property, and all these bureaucratic things about it, yeah, I do feel like she’s partly ours,” Lopes added. “We created that comic book and that is ours. I gave Kara a lighter tone of blue [in Woman of Tomorrow]. In the new Supergirl series, I made sure it was a darker shade of blue—because Woman of Tomorrow has that lighter blue [on her suit]. There’s a lot of light in that book, and it shines more.”

“Kara has a ton of meaning to me. It’s a story I always tell: I always loved to draw since I was very young, I always liked to create characters and stories. But I didn’t know doing comics was [a viable career], because there just wasn’t a thing in Brazil like that. We didn’t have access to a lot of comics,” Evely concluded. “When I was a teenager, I was in a paper store, and I saw a thumbs up from Supergirl on a cover—I recognized her from cartoons, from television. But there was a little bit of text on the cover that said ‘Oh, drawn by a Brazilian artist.’ It was a real job, and done by a Brazilian? I can do that too?'”

“So when I started working on Woman of Tomorrow, I had already worked for 10 years with comics at that point. I had never tried pitching for her, but then I saw the pitch from Tom, it just felt perfect. I could draw more fantasy, and starscapes that I love. Like I said, I was in a very stressful moment working on it at first. In the process of creating the pages, I felt like I was starting to fall in love with comics again,” Evely continued. “Supergirl… I discovered my future job through her. And then she saved me again, and brought me back to what I really love. Woman of Tomorrow is the book that is represents all that to me now.”

“I didn’t start reading comics until I was a little older,” Lopes added. “I hadn’t ready any Supergirl comics before working with Tom and Bilquis. My story begins with her there, but I fell in love with the characters Tom and Bilquis created for that book—and now she’s changed my life! That’s my favorite DC character ever.”

For King, too, there was a special resonance that he had not first felt when exploring who was on offer for his next DC venture. “Again, this book was written during the pandemic. My children were home with me 24 hours while it was being written. My daughter was 10, 11 at the time, and every page—every story, every ending, beginning, we would talk about it just so we had something to talk about,” King reflected. “And in making the book, I didn’t intend to do this, but I ended up wanting… I tried to make someone as complicated and as cool and as strong and as beautiful and as tough as my daughter. The book will always be the moment between the two of us as the world is sort of catching up.”

“As she grows older, I’ll still have this book. It’s beautiful.”

Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow is available in multiple complete formats, wherever good comics are sold. Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, the film, is currently slated for a June 2026 release.

I can’t think of another time we’ve covered a collectible twice. Here on io9, we cover all manner of merch—toys, art, clothing, etc.—but once we cover it, it’s done. However, when it comes to the exclusive figure Hasbro is bringing to Star Wars Celebration Japan in April, our initial coverage wasn’t enough to showcase just how awesome this figure is, and so here we are.

To recap, Hasbro will have an exclusive Black Series set of the Ronin and R5-D56 from Star Wars: Visions on sale at the convention. They’re super cool figures, all black and white just like the short film they originated from. But, what makes this release even more special is that the figures are going to come in “premium Japanese-only single-language packaging.” And wow, does that really take things up a notch. Here are some images.

So, as you can see, the figures come packed with some really beautiful art held closed with some type of string. And then, the package opens up to reveal the characters are in a giant, widescreen movie. And that’s without all the accessories, of which there are 11: including “a lightsaber, staff, two rocket thrusters, and six droid tools.”

The issue we’re having is, clearly, you have to buy two of these things, one to open and one to display. However, the implication here is that just the packaging is exclusive. That means the figures themselves may be made available at another date. So, potentially, you can buy these and display those.

This particular version of the figure will exclusively be available at the Hasbro booth at Star Wars Celebration Japan, starting April 18. You’ll find us there in line.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Elon Musk Declares Intention to Bribe Voters (Again) to Attack U.S. Judicial System,https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-declares-intention-to-bribe-voters-again-to-attack-u-s-judicial-system-2000582289,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 21:05:19 GMT","Wisconsin voters will go to the polls next week to choose between candidates for the state’s Supreme Court. Elon Musk has spent $17 million so far to support the Republican-aligned candidate, according to the Associated Press. And the billionaire oligarch is really spreading the money around this weekend before Tuesday’s vote, offering up $1 million each to two people who attend his rally in Wisconsin on Sunday.

Musk tweeted Friday morning about his planned visit to the state, though an exact location for his appearance hasn’t been announced yet.

“On Sunday night, I will give a talk in Wisconsin,” Musk tweeted. “Entrance is limited to those who have voted in the Supreme Court election. I will also personally hand over two checks for a million dollars each in appreciation for you taking the time to vote. This is super important.”

That offer seems to run afoul of Wisconsin state bribery laws, as countless people pointed out on social media Friday. And it looks like the billionaire oligarch saw the outcry. Or at least his lawyers did. Musk deleted the tweet to “clarify” what he meant, which presumably means one of his attorneys provided him with wording that might get him into less legal trouble.

“On Sunday night, I will give a talk in Wisconsin,” Musk wrote in the new tweet on Friday afternoon. “To clarify a previous post, entrance is limited to those who have signed the petition in opposition to activist judges. I will also hand over checks for a million dollars to 2 people to be spokesmen for the petition.”

One of Musk’s political action committees already gave out $1 million to a Green Bay man on Wednesday. Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Susan Crawford is Democratically-aligned, and her spokesperson told the AP that Musk’s payments are “corrupt” and “extreme,” calling them “disgraceful to our state and judiciary.” Crawford’s challenger, Brad Schimel, has closely aligned himself with Trump and Republicans.

This isn’t the first time Musk has offered large cash handouts in exchange for votes. The Tesla CEO did the exact same thing during the 2024 presidential election in swing states that he was working to deliver for President Donald Trump. Musk initially said he was offering $1 million prizes in Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and Michigan “randomly” in the lead up to the 2024 election. But his lawyer later clarified there was nothing random about the giveaway. The cash handouts were later branded as “salaries” for promotional work supporting the First and Second Amendments.

Prosecutors in Philadelphia sued over the scheme, but a judge allowed the brazen plan to go forward. Ultimately, the prosecutors dropped the case after the election, which seems to be why we as a society are at this point now. Anyone can do illegal things before elections, as long as they win. At least that seems to be the takeaway.

Musk has been running roughshod over democracy ever since Trump tasked him with leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a pseudo-agency that’s been systematically destroying the federal government since Trump took power on Jan. 20. That also happens to be the day Musk made two Nazi-style salutes, gestures that he would say much later weren’t intended to be related to Nazism.

Wisconsin’s Attorney General Josh Kaul released a statement Friday announcing his intention to file an injunction against Musk’s actions in the state.

“The Wisconsin Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that elections in Wisconsin are safe, secure, free and fair. We are aware of the offer recently posted by Elon Musk to award a million dollars to two people at an event in Wisconsin this weekend,” Kaul said, according to local news outlet WTMJ. “Based on our understanding of applicable Wisconsin law, we intend to take legal action today to seek a court order to stop this from happening.”

Kaul filed an injunction in Dane County Circuit Court, where the case was randomly assigned to the Democratically-aligned Susan Crawford, reports the AP. Crawford is apparently recusing herself, according to a spokesperson who spoke with the news service.

It’s not clear how quickly the injunction will be ruled on, but whatever happens in Tuesday’s election, here’s hoping the Wisconsin AGE doesn’t drop the case. This stuff is so much bigger than one race in one state. The U.S. has reached a point of existential crisis as international students are getting abducted by secret police and shipped to ICE facilities thousands of miles away, all for writing an op-ed in the student newspaper. And people are already being shipped to a foreign prison without trial. If Musk is allowed to just keep buying votes, and Musk’s political allies get to just keep destroying the U.S. government, it really is over for this country.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Samsung’s Attempt at Protecting the Galaxy Ring from Oura Backfired,https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-attempt-at-preemptively-protecting-galaxy-ring-patents-backfired-2000582278,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 20:45:32 GMT","Imagine making a big mess, only to realize it was for naught. A judge has dismissed Samsung’s attempt at striking before the iron’s hot. Last summer, before Samsung had even released the Galaxy Ring to the public, the company filed a lawsuit asking a judge to proclaim its business didn’t infringe on any patents, specifically, patents related to the Oura Ring. This week, the judge ruled this as malarkey (not a direct quote), and Samsung has until late April to appeal the decision with an amended complaint.

What does all this legal back-and-forth mean? Samsung struck before Oura, the company behind the Oura Ring, could sniff through its patents and get litigious. Samsung figured that since Oura is known for going after its competition on standard wellness patents—it’s gone after lower-cost brands like Ringconn and Circular—it would come after Samsung, too. Considering Oura’s business is squarely the smart ring and the accompanying ecosystem, it makes sense.

Samsung had asked the judge to file a declaratory judgment lawsuit in the Northern District of California court, where it filed the suit. This “judgment” would indicate that Samsung had not copied any of Oura’s patents, like one for “assessing a readiness score of a user” and a “method for manufacturing thereof.” Samsung claims that Oura had a “pattern of indiscriminate assertion of patent infringement against any and all competitors in the smart ring market” as the reason for its lawsuit. Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguínp ultimately threw out the lawsuit.

Samsung was trying to strike against Oura before Oura could strike against it. It’s lawsuit ping-pong, with Samsung starting it out in Northern California, where Oura is headquartered, to get a declaration filed before Oura attempts to bring the fight to Samsung’s turf in Texas, where it has slightly more reign.

Ultimately, the power these companies have is inherently related to how much money they have to throw at lawsuits, even before they materialize. Oura may not have as much manufacturing prowess as Samsung, but it’s not doing too badly in securing the funding it needs to continue. It helps, too, that Oura is a good product. It’s good enough that Samsung is afraid it’ll come for its business, even if it is relatively minor.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Tim Pool Podcast Reportedly Joins the White House Press Pool,https://gizmodo.com/tim-pool-podcast-reportedly-joins-the-white-house-press-pool-2000582130,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 20:32:56 GMT","The so-called ""manosphere"" helped deliver the young male vote to Trump in the 2024 presidential election.

The Trump administration has bucked decades of precedent by denying some legacy media outlets access to the White House. In place of real journalists, the government increasingly seems to prefer the presence of partisan hacks and infotainment-style influencers. The newest addition to the White House press pool would appear to be a man who was once described by Splinter as a “beanie-headed dipshit,” and who, among other things, was recently accused of receiving millions of dollars from the Russian government.

“Right-wing YouTuber Tim Pool has made it to the White House pool — someone from his “Timcast” channel will be part of today’s pool duty covering the president,” Will Sommer, senior reporter for The Bulwark, wrote on X on Friday. “If you’re concerned about Tim Pool – revealed last year to be taking millions of dollars from the Russian govt, he says unwittingly – being part of the pool today, don’t worry. Today’s White House pool also includes the Falun Gong-owned Epoch Times,” Sommer added.

On his own X profile, Pool reposted Sommer’s tweet, writing merely: “Epic.” Gizmodo reached out to the White House and Timcast for more information.

The Trump administration has sought to transform and take control of the White House press pool in ways that defy any modern precedent. Most recently, the administration barred outlets like the Associated Press and Reuters from traditional kinds of access and coverage (like events on Air Force One or in the Oval Office) because they refused to update their style guide to conform with a recent executive order that renamed the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America.”

Meanwhile, the government has set up what it calls “Podcast Row,” a new forum that lets “creators” ask questions of government officials, while also streaming their shows live from the White House. “Welcome to The White House Podcast Row—where the viewership crushes CNN and the legacy media,” the White House posted on Instagram Thursday. The personalities included in the first event, which is set to be a regular occurrence, reportedly included Natalie Winters from Steve Bannon’s War Room podcast and Breanna Morello, an independent journalist who previously worked for Newsmax. Now, it seems possible Pool may have joined the group’s ranks.

“Bringing in new media outlets has obviously been a priority of this administration and we will explore all options that allow us to reach as many Americans as possible,” Kaelan Dorr, White House Deputy Communications Director, told The Verge.

The Trump administration has been savvy about tapping into new media’s ranks as a way to reach young, typically male, voters. The so-called “manosphere”—a circuit of male-oriented podcasts—has also been credited with helping deliver the young male vote to Trump during the 2024 presidential election. Joe Rogan, a key part of that media ecosystem, notably brought Trump on for a friendly conversation during the election’s final months.

Last year, an indictment from the U.S. Justice Department alleged that Pool and others had been paid by a Russian influence operation that sought to capitalize on anti-Ukrainian sentiment and seed it into the U.S. population through rightwing media. After the indictment dropped, Pool tweeted that he’d had no idea about the Russian affiliation. “That being said, we still do not know what is true as these are only allegations,” Pool said in a post on X. “Putin is a scumbag, Russia sucks donkey balls.” He later deleted the tweet.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,"Google Is Closing Up Android Development, but It’s Not What You Think",https://gizmodo.com/google-is-closing-up-android-development-but-its-not-what-you-think-2000581159,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 20:30:45 GMT","The writing has been on the wall as Google has slowly moved away from Android as the core product and toward the bright light of artificial intelligence. This week’s news about how Google plans to change how it develops the operating system seems to seal the deal. Android Authority confirmed that Google plans to take Android development entirely in-house. Essentially, Google is privatizing the Android source code.

As with all things privatized, this is good news for Google, the company that operates Android. It streamlines Android development so that the company doesn’t have to worry about managing two sets of source code and fielding comments while working on the next version of Android. It’s good news for users, too, because it means there won’t be two versions of Android floating out in the ether while it’s in development. It can be confusing to navigate between the internal branch of Android source code, which Google passes out to the brands under Google Mobile Services (GMS) agreements, and the public Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which anyone and any manufacturer can use.

It also speaks to how priorities have changed internally at Google as it shifts focus toward what AI can do on its various software platforms. Gemini is the main sell, now. It was apparent last year at Google I/O 2024 that it would become the objective, especially after the hardware and software teams were combined into an all-inclusive “Platforms and Devices” team. Then, a month after the conference, Google announced that former Vice President of Engineering for Android, David Burke, would be stepping into an advisory position at the company instead. Burke had been a steward of the platform for 14 years.

The move to developing Android in-house shouldn’t have too many implications on the platform. “The change makes sense when it comes to allocating resources to work that matters,” texted Carolina Milanesi, a principal analyst, after I asked her about what this means for the broader smartphone market. Overall, nothing major will change with the Android platform on the consumer-facing side. The biggest difference will be in how Google interfaces with the developers who don’t have GMS agreements. “Developers will have maybe less understanding of what is coming…but their access ultimately doesn’t change,” added Milanesi.

As of this writing, Google hasn’t publicly blogged about this change, though I independently confirmed with the company that this is the route it’s headed. It’s likely because nothing should change on the side of Android users. If anything, the code sleuthing you see going on around Android blogs may dry up over the coming months since Google won’t release as much of its source code to the public until it’s ready for primetime. It will annoy developers fishing around for future tidbits, but it shouldn’t bother anyone using an Android phone otherwise.",gizmodo

After replacing Google Assistant with Gemini, Google’s next big plan for Android Auto is to let you play a cartoon arcade racing game inside your full-sized sedan. The next update to Android Auto 14.1 is adding a select few games you can play on your car’s touchscreen. Before you ask, yes, it’s only available while you’re parked. Then again, if Tesla owners’ previous misadventures with games on the go are any evidence, maybe car companies can cool it with providing features that should be reserved for our phones or dedicated gaming devices.

Google first promoted gaming apps on Android Auto when discussing its March 4 Pixel Drop. The first few games launching in the new Android Auto 14.1 beta update include Farm Heroes Saga, Candy Crush Soda Saga, Angry Birds 2, and Beach Buggy Racing. 9to5Google showed a video of this feature in action with a connected Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The user was obviously struggling to control the Beach Buggy with a single finger while leaning over in the driver’s seat. Even on the bigger screen, it’s certainly easier to have two thumbs available with the screen directly in front. But I’m sure if you’ve ever been stuck in the car with one kid while waiting for the other to get out of an after school event you can see the value in an extra distraction.

These few games may not be optimized for Android Auto, just yet. The site mentioned that Angry Birds 2 failed to start, then was “grayed out” in the app drawer. Beach Buggy Racing still showed the option for tilt controls, and we doubt many people are putting gyroscope sensors on their hydraulic lowrider suspension for the sake of feeling tighter arcade racing controls.

Google does have a video of a user playing Farm Heroes Saga and the game fits the car’s aspect ratio well, so we’ll see if that remains the case for all compatible vehicles at full release. The full-screen app experience isn’t meant for the person in the driver seat, but will probably work fine for a kid bored out of their mind waiting on their Sonic Ocean Water. Still, the center console seems like the worst place to play a game, no matter which seat your sitting in.

It’s the kind of feature that seems extraneous but for very select few users. The ability to access YouTube on Android Auto while parked seems more of a shoo in, but the focus on gaming seems like an effort to entice more Tesla buyers. Tesla cars could play some games natively since 2019, though the Elon Musk-run electric car company took heat after drivers started playing games while on the move. Tesla later blocked its gaming features when the car was in motion under threat from federal investigators.

Google may see gaming as a way to get users interested in Android-based autonomous driving. The inevitable next step is for Google’s empire to put Android in all its autonomous vehicles (courtesy of Waymo), which is really the only place where games in cars make sense.

Or, of course, you could just unplug your smartphone and play games there.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Legendary U.S. Particle Collider Is About to Perform Its Final Smash,https://gizmodo.com/legendary-u-s-particle-collider-is-about-to-perform-its-final-smash-2000582038,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 20:00:21 GMT","After 25 years of smashing gold nuclei together at light speeds, Brookhaven National Laboratory’s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider is hanging up its boots—erm, superconducting magnets.

The collider’s final run—its 25th—kicked off this week on Long Island, in a swan song for the venerable collider that will be succeeded—in fact, transformed into—Brookhaven Lab’s Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Over the course of 2025, RHIC physicists will complete data collection on quark-gluon plasma, the soup of particles that existed in the earliest days of the universe.

“The original idea behind RHIC was to create, for the first time on Earth, a state of matter that existed in the universe a few microseconds after the Big Bang: the quark-gluon plasma, and we did,” said James Dunlop, the associate department chair for nuclear physics at Brookhaven Lab, in a call with Gizmodo. “That’s one of the big legacies—that we actually created it—but the more interesting thing is that its properties were quite different from what we’d expected them to be.”

“You don’t think that when you boil water, you’re going to make something that’s much more liquid than water itself, right?,” Dunlop added. “And that’s actually what we found: that is that the quark-gluon plasma behaves as the most perfect liquid that we know of.”

For the RHIC’s final run, the top priority is gold-on-gold collisions at energies of 200 billion electron volts. The collider will run those collisions through June, and will break in July and August to avoid running experiments in the sweltering summer heat.

The run is slated to collect observations on 10 billion events, according to Lijuan Ruan, co-spokesperson for the collider’s STAR detector, in a Brookhaven release.

“Additionally, we plan to leverage our detector’s ‘triggers’—sensors that analyze characteristics from collisions in real time—to acquire a substantial number of events enriched with high-energy particles,” Ruan added.

Like CERN’s Large Hadron Collider—which is a huge particle collider with experiments set up around its circumference—RHIC has several experiments that draw data from its collisions. In the upcoming run, the collider’s sPHENIX detector will try to capture data from about 50 billion collision events to study the quark-gluon plasma.

“By combining these RHIC measurements with high-energy experiments at Europe’s Large Hadron Collider—which generates a QGP at higher temperatures—we’ll be able to refine our understanding of how this exotic matter behaves as its temperature changes,” said Megan Connors, a physicist at Georgia State University and co-spokesperson of sPHENIX, in the same release.

When RHIC’s final run is over, Brookhaven will transition the collider into America’s next collider, the Electron-Ion Collider, by reusing components of the older setup and adding some new components for electron acceleration. That collider will be (pardon the pun) charged with looking inside atomic nuclei, protons, and neutrons. The collider will specifically scrutinize the strong nuclear force, which binds quarks together.

“From RHIC to EIC, scientists are mapping the transition of nuclear matter from a hot, dense state, generated in gold-gold collisions, and then planning to use electrons — the smallest projectiles — to probe cold nuclear matter at the EIC,” sPHENIX co-spokesperson Jin Huang said in the release.

Such basic research has implications for nuclear physics projects on Earth, but also understanding the primordial soup of particles that existed at the beginning of the universe. Such fundamental research is the rising tide that raises all boats—provided that science labs are given the resources to support that work.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,"The Woman in the Yard Is Terrifying, in a Very Uneven, Upsetting Way",https://gizmodo.com/woman-in-the-yard-review-horror-universal-blumhouse-2000582092,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 18:30:06 GMT","As terrifying as the idea behind The Woman in the Yard is, when you realize what it’s actually about, it’s even scarier. That should be a positive thing—scary is good, right? But in this case, it shifts the film’s expectations and aims in such a radical way that as bold as the choice is, it doesn’t quite work.

That first idea—the one shown in the trailers—is this. A mom named Ramona (Danielle Deadwyler) has recently been widowed when her husband, David (Russell Hornsby), died in a car accident. She’s struggling to keep it together with two rambunctious kids (Peyton Jackson and Estella Kahiha) when a mysterious woman appears in their yard. Dressed all in black, her face covered in a veil, the woman tells Ramona “Today’s the day” as she calmly sits outside, gazing back at the house.

The reason we can endure most of the classic horror scenarios—unstoppable slashers, killer ghosts, murder traps, etc.—is that none of them feel possible. We deal with them because in reality, most of us would never actually deal with them. The Woman in the Yard hits in the opposite way. Any of us can imagine the guttural terror we’d feel if someone so devilishly challenged our safest space. It’s beyond unsettling. And so, director Jaume Collet-Serra (Black Adam, Jungle Cruise, Carry On) uses that to his advantage. Tension builds slowly as we explore the family’s fear through charged parental interactions, canted camera angles, and long shots highlighting the expansive nature of the home.

Within that set-up, like the family we’re left wondering a few things: who is this woman and why is she there? The answers come slowly, as the film instead focuses on what the woman can do as opposed to why she’s doing it, leading to a few fun sequences. Eventually, though answers do come. And that’s when the movie takes its turn.

Clearly, whatever the answers are in The Woman in the Yard, we want them to be surprising, interesting, and scary. Solving these mysteries is why we’re there. And, fortunately, the answers check all of those boxes.

Unfortunately, to achieve that, the script by Sam Stefanak has to pivot away from the typical horror tropes, which causes some issues. Now, to explain that in enough detail to make my point, I have to talk about some spoilers. I won’t ruin the ending or spell out every single reveal, but to fully dissect why the film’s traditional horror elements don’t fit cleanly with its ultimate intentions, I have to reveal those intentions. If you plan to see the movie, skip past the next photo to avoid the spoilers.

At a certain point, we learn the titular character is there not to haunt Ramona, it’s there to help her. Since the accident, she’s been wracked with guilt and grief and has been praying for the strength to kill herself, even knowing it’ll leave her kids orphaned. “Today’s the day” refers to the day Ramona will finally muster to courage to do that, and the woman is there to facilitate. Yeah. We know. Kind of messed up.

Those revelations come in a few of the best scenes in the movie, but they also seemingly mark the end of one story and the beginning of another. The first is the supernatural horror movie we thought we were watching. The second is about what a person hoping to end their own life must go through. And both of those stories have different expectations. Once we know there are real-life stakes at play, all the supernatural things like shadow monsters or creepy hauntings feel out of place and insignificant. Did they happen? Did they not? Why would they happen at all? The idea of a mother of two killing herself simply is too serious for any of that. So we’re left with these diametric and opposing forces, both in the film and outside it.

Plus, the idea of Ramona taking her own life is so much scarier than anything else, but not in a silly, horror movie way. The implications are disturbing and staggering, so as the film dives into it, things rightfully get uncomfortable and challenging. Again, this should be a good thing, but it’s a betrayal to the movie itself. You feel gaslit about why you sat down to watch the movie at all, and guilty that you didn’t take it as seriously as it deserved to be. As shocking and brash as the reveal is, it doesn’t quite work.

What does work, besides Collet-Serra’s direction, are the performances of the family. Deadwyler gives an intense, captivating portrayal of a woman on the edge that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Kahiha and Hornsby have less to do, but each fills a warm, loving void much needed in Ramona’s life and the movie. Ultimately, though, the breakout is Jackson: he’s a commanding, charismatic presence and probably the person the audience most relates to. We’ll be seeing much more of him.

In the end, we’re glad Universal and Blumhouse had the guts to make and release The Woman in the Yard. Using the horror genre to tackle important issues is becoming increasingly rare, especially in a wide release, so kudos to that. You just wish those issues felt more cohesive within the horror narrative, and not like a big red mark on an otherwise clean surface. If the film had more fully embraced one side or the other, it would’ve worked better.

https://gizmodo.com,The Depressing Reason Those Terrible Fake Movie Trailers Are Never Going Away,https://gizmodo.com/the-depressing-reason-those-terrible-fake-movie-trailers-are-never-going-away-2000582103,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 17:30:45 GMT","The latest viral AI craze has seen quickly generated Ghibli-style art ripping away the craftsmanship of animators for the sake of clicks. But the technology continues to pervade the entire medium of online entertainment, including fake movie trailers. The trend began with splicing clips of actors in other scenes to build a narrative that would fit into, say, an upcoming Marvel Studios or DC Studios movie—and in the past, movie studios would ding the videos to be taken down yet invariably fan trailer after fan trailer would pop up anyway.

As AI improves, YouTube channels that use the tech to create even more deceiving fake trailers have risen in popularity. Many of them have amassed millions of followers and get recognized by the platform as fan trailer creators, as opposed to “view” grifters who make bank out of trolling general audiences. (We all know an uncle or old high school classmate who share fake trailers, naively thinking they’re the real thing.)

For industry professionals, it’s a headache to have to deal with influencers and fan sites that run fake content without checking the source. Filmmaker James Gunn often takes to his social media platforms to call out fake trailers, including widely shared clips purported to be (but are not) from his upcoming DC Studios Superman film. But what exactly is being done by the studios to stop this? Nothing really.

In fact, it turns out that many studios are actually opting to cash in on the fake trailers. Deadline revealed that studios have been reported to be “actively taking a cut” from the earnings of fake AI trailer YouTube creators; Screen Culture was one example given.

“Emails reviewed by Deadline show how Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has claimed monetization on Screen Culture trailers for Superman and House of the Dragon,” the trade stated. “This means that instead of copyright striking the videos (if a channel accrues three strikes within 90 days, it can be banned from YouTube), WBD is asking YouTube to ensure it receives the ad revenue from views. Similarly, Sony Pictures has claimed revenue on fake trailers for Spider-Man and Kraven The Hunter, while Paramount did the same on a counterfeit Gladiator II video.”

Well, capitalism is going to capitalism, as the studios’ move is seemingly to enter into mutually beneficial deals with fake trailer creators at the cost of their talent and the film medium. Sure, they get some money or get the real trailer to run right before or after, but the inundation of the fake amid the real is what turns people off of the actual product being released.

At the end of the day, fake trailers, either with spliced footage from other films or with AI generated imagery, are probably pretty low on the spectrum of bad things that can be done with deepfake technology. But studios’ tacit enabling over AI to use actor likenesses—in exchange for what is chump change to them—only normalizes the worst possible use of the tech in the wide world of the web. That seemingly doesn’t matter to who gets the bucks from the billions of views.",gizmodo

Madison Square Garden is home to the New York Knicks, one of the most storied performance venues in the country, and a surveillance state dystopia. Since 2018, the venue has been equipped with facial recognition tools used to identify people deemed to be potential security threats. But it also has seemingly become the go-to tool to keep anyone critical of MSG CEO James Dolan out of the space. The latest victim of MSG’s all-seeing eye is a person who made a t-shirt critical of Dolan years ago and never even wore it to the venue.

According to The Verge, a Seattle resident named Frank Miller was in New York earlier this week for his parents’ wedding anniversary, and the family planned to attend a show at Radio City Music Hall, a venue owned by MSG. Miller was immediately pulled aside by security after scanning his ticket, handed a document informing him that he’s banned, and asked to leave.

So, what did Miller do to get banned? According to the account that he was given by staff, as reported by The Verge, he was told that he was involved in an incident in 2021 that landed him on the do-not-enter list. The problem with that explanation, though, is that Miller says he hasn’t been to a Madison Square Garden venue in more than a decade.

Instead, it seems it was something he made that got him banned. Miller does graphic design, and after former Knicks staple Charles Oakley was forcibly removed from MSG in 2017—allegedly at the behest of Dolan, of whom Oakley had been publicly critical—Miller made a t-shirt that read “Ban Dolan” in the style of the Knicks logo. A friend of Miller’s wore that shirt to MSG in 2021 and very publicly got kicked out and banned from the venue for it.

The fact that Miller made the shirt was apparently enough to get him put on the venue’s ban list should he ever show up, which he finally did about four years after his friend got the boot. In a statement to The Verge, an MSG representative claimed that Miller had “made threats against an MSG executive on social media and produced and sold merchandise that was offensive in nature,” and that his behavior was “disrespectful and disruptive and in violation of our code of conduct.”

Miller is just the latest in a long line of people who have seemingly drawn the personal ire of Dolan and, as a result, been banned from the venues he owns. In 2023, New York Attorney General Letitia James opened an inquiry into Dolan’s alleged blacklist of enemies, which at the time reportedly included “thousands of lawyers” from as many as 90 firms who were involved in litigation against Dolan and MSG. There are also fans who have been critical of Dolan on social media who now have difficulty getting past security to attend shows and games.

Most of the enforcement of Dolan’s bans appears to stem from the facial recognition technology utilized by venue security, which helps ID people who are on the ban list. But based on Miller’s case, there seems to be some surveillance beyond that at play. It would seem that the only way Miller would even end up on MSG’s radar is if someone was scraping social media, keeping tabs on voices critical of Dolan, and putting them in the system to keep them out of future events. But surely a billionaire wouldn’t be so thin-skinned as to turn his venues into retribution machines against his critics… right?",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,The Star Set to Explode Totally Flaked. Here’s What to Expect Next,https://gizmodo.com/the-star-set-to-explode-totally-flaked-heres-what-to-expect-next-2000582048,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 15:50:12 GMT","Sky watchers were disappointed last night when a binary star system didn’t erupt in a nova explosion that was predicted to take place on Thursday. But fear not, the famous blaze star is still due for its recurring nova to erupt any day now.

The binary star system T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), also known as the Blaze Star, periodically explodes every 79 years or so, competing with the brightest stars in the night sky. A paper published last year predicted that the Blaze Star would erupt on March 27, building hope for a spectacular light show to brighten up our skies. Unfortunately, the recurring nova was a no-show on Thursday night, but the window for its explosion remains open, and there are two upcoming dates when it might take place.

The first recorded sighting of the T CrB nova happened more than 800 years ago, and the cycle repeats itself roughly once every 79 years on average. The last two previous explosions occurred in 1866 and 1946. The current window for the rare astronomical event opened in February 2024, and it’s still open, but astronomers aren’t sure exactly when the star system could go boom.

Astronomer Jean Schneider of the Paris Observatory published a paper last year in Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society, in which he combined the previous explosion dates with the orbital dynamics of the star system to pinpoint an exact date for the star system to explode. Schneider’s calculations landed on March 27, but he also listed two subsequent dates: November 10, 2025 and June 25, 2026.

It’s hard to predict when the star system will explode since its eruptions haven’t been observed that many times. Astronomers have been observing the Blaze Star, and found that it has spent the past decade behaving much like it did in the lead-up to its last visible eruption nearly 80 years ago, according to NASA.

Rather than relying on the behavior of the star, the recent study estimated that the nova eruptions occurred at intervals that were an exact multiple of the star system’s orbital period—meaning the explosions happened after a specific number of orbits the stars completed around each other. Schneider concluded that T CrB explodes once every 128 orbits, with each orbital period being roughly 227 days. But again, that’s just one researcher’s way of finding a pattern to the occurrences of the cosmos. To be clear, the system could explode later today, or next week, or a month from now, or as Schneider predicts, on November 10. We simply don’t know—we just know the explosion is imminent.

Located in the Corona Borealis constellation, T CrB is a binary system made up of a white dwarf (the remains of a dead star with a mass comparable to that of the Sun squeezed into an Earth-sized body) and an ancient red giant star. The red giant, roughly 1.12 times the mass of our Sun, orbits the white dwarf every 227 days. The two stars are separated by only 0.54 astronomical units, about the same as the distance from the Sun to Venus.

The red giant star is slowly being stripped of its hydrogen by the strong gravitational pull of its companion, the white dwarf, as the two are interlocked in a dangerous orbital dance. The material from the red giant star forms an accretion disk, which swirls around the white dwarf. As the hydrogen from the red giant star accretes onto the surface of the white dwarf, it causes a buildup of pressure and heat, which eventually triggers a thermonuclear explosion that blasts away all that material.

Unlike a supernova, which destroys a dying star, the dwarf star remains intact after the nova explosion. It does, however, blast the material into space in an explosive flash that’s bright enough to see from Earth with the unaided eye.

The star system itself is currently invisible to the unaided eye at a magnitude of +10. After its eruption, however, T CrB will be elevated to a magnitude of +2, almost as bright as the North Star. Although the outburst itself will be short-lived, the binary star system will twinkle bright in the night skies for a week or so before gradually fading back to its original brightness levels.

We’re just going to have to wait a little bit longer to see it happen before our eyes.",gizmodo

Shohreh Aghdashloo’s career goes back decades, with her big breakout coming in 2003’s House of Sand and Fog, and roles since in X-Men: The Last Stand, 24, The Punisher, The Penguin, and more. But most genre fans look at Aghdashloo and think of one character in particular: The Expanse‘s Chrisjen Avasarala, the fierce, fabulous defender of Earth throughout the much-loved sci-fi series. And as it turns out, her popularity on that show helped bring her to her latest role, Wheel of Time‘s similarly fierce and fabulous Elaida a’Roihan.

Speaking to Collider, Aghdashloo credits Expanse fans with sparking her interest in joining Wheel of Time, now in its third season on Prime Video. “As soon as I was done with The Expanse, the fans of The Expanse and those who liked my work on The Expanse, they started saying, ‘We need to find her another TV series because we want to see her at work,'” she recalled with delight.

“One of them came up with the idea of The Wheel of Time. I had seen The Wheel of Time, and I was thinking, ‘Would there be a place for me in The Wheel of Time?’ Obviously, I didn’t say anything. It wasn’t for me to initiate. Then [fans] started saying, ‘Yes, she should come to The Wheel of Time, and she can do a good job with the series.'”

Aghdashloo’s social media person took note and encouraged the actor to follow up, especially since her fans remained so enthusiastically persistent about the idea. “Again, I said, ‘Well, it’s not for me to initiate. Let’s go find a showrunner!’ One of them came up with his name: the amazing Rafe Judkins, [Wheel of Time‘s] showrunner—one of the best showrunners I’ve ever worked with. He started DMing, saying, ‘Yes, she’s been on our radar since 2018, but we knew she was busy with The Expanse. She’s not busy anymore? Bring her over.’ Two weeks after, I received an offer from Rafe. I was so happy. I could not believe it.”

And indeed, it all worked out: you can catch Aghdashloo—whose jewel-bedecked wardrobe as Elaida is nearly as stunning as her Avasarala outfits were on The Expanse—stealing every one of her scenes on Wheel of Time season three, now on Prime Video.",gizmodo

How much of the internet? A lot of the internet.

Deadline reports that the Doomsday cast announcement pulled in over 275 million views over its runtime, and 3.1 million mentions across social media–trumping the view records the studio previously established for the first Deadpool & Wolverine trailer. 24 hours after it dropped, and we were all still making rather silly jokes about chairs, the livestream remained the #2 trending stream on Youtube. Apparently no one just wanted to relive the magic when Marvel themselves condensed the whole thing down to under two minutes to post on Twitter.

Considering much of the general doom-and-gloom there has been about Marvel’s output at the moment–a general malaise in the post-Endgame pivot to Disney+ combined with the recent sting of Captain America: Brave New World being met to middling reviews–it speaks to the studio’s ability to maintain much of that grip it’s had on pop culture over the past almost 20 years now. Perhaps any other studio with the reckless confidence to make people tune in for over five hours to see fold up chairs and a tiny glimpse of Robert Downey Jr. may have crashed and burned, and yet here we are.

And yet we may still be, if Marvel has anything to say about it. Doomsday‘s oddball cast mix–two returning Avengers A-Listers, the Fantastic Four, 95% of the main cast of the upcoming Thunderbolts, a random chunk of Fox X-Men stars, and then a few stalwart MCU mainstays–immediately left fans thinking that there may be more to come, either for Doomsday or inevitably for the multiversal shenanigans of Secret Wars, and the studio itself seems to be indicating that there will be.

“That’s what you call a deep bench of talent…actually it’s more like a row, but an extra long one…that must be it…right?,” Downey Jr. wrote in the comments of Marvel’s Instagram post about the venture, only for Marvel Studios to respond shortly after:

“There’s always room for more…”

But now, the game maker has decided to let us know a major update out of nowhere… in the most Nintendo way possible.

This morning, Nintendo confirmed that Wes Ball’s Legend of Zelda movie will hit theaters March 26, 2027. They didn’t do so via traditional social media, or a press release–they didn’t even save it for one of its vaunted Nintendo Direct streams, like they have with prior movie news. Instead, the company casually revealed the date through its new Nintendo Today calendar app.

Nintendo Today was revealed as part of yesterday’s Nintendo Direct stream, presumably the last dedicated entirely to the Nintendo Switch as the company begins preparations to fully reveal its successor, Nintendo Switch 2, early next week. Essentially an elaborate calendar application, Today will be a hub for Nintendo-themed updates on a daily basis, from concept art drops to, eventually hosts of future news livestreams.

And now, apparently, major breaking news from the company before you see it anywhere else. It speaks to Nintendo’s command of people’s attention that they can get people to care as much about a new calendar app as they did an alarm clock (and then some), but then again, that is part of the charm.

https://gizmodo.com,"CoreWeave Is at the Center of the AI Revolution, and Its IPO looks Like a House of Cards",https://gizmodo.com/coreweave-is-at-the-center-of-the-ai-revolution-and-its-ipo-looks-like-a-house-of-cards-2000582117,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 18:47:10 GMT","Today, CoreWeave began trading on the stock market, and it is looking like an inauspicious start for the AI sector. The company had initially hoped to sell shares for $47 to $55 a piece, but began trading at $39 despite being propped up by Nvidia with a massive $250 million order at $40 per share. When you look under the hood, CoreWeave is a dog of a company, with business fundamentals that raise a lot of questions, explaining the less than enthusiastic demand by investors.

CoreWeave in recent years found itself in something of an enviable position. Starting out in 2017, it bought GPUs to supply to the cryptocurrency mining industry, only to pivot to AI when that became the hot new trend. CoreWeave is fundamentally a picks and shovels business: It supplies GPUs to an industry that has desperately sought them.

Unfortunately though, it appears that the industry does not need them as much today. CoreWeave is going public just as its biggest customer, Microsoft, has pulled back on spending in AI infrastructure, releasing its leases on data centers globally and allowing OpenAI to find other partners. Chips were suddenly in huge demand after OpenAI launched ChatGPT in 2023, but the supply shortage seems to be subsiding in a way that could be bad for CoreWeave. From the Wall Street Journal:

The supply shortage has since subsided, and companies say it’s comparatively easy to buy the required chips. Renting a GPU for an hour cost about $5.50 in mid-2023; it’s now $1.55, said Evan Conrad, chief executive of San Francisco Compute, a market for GPUs.

To put into context the risk here, Microsoft accounted for a whopping 62% of CoreWeave’s revenue in 2024. But it has declined optioning a further $12 billion in infrastructure, which had to be taken by OpenAI instead.

Furthermore, Nvidia has been a major backer of CoreWeave, only to have the money come straight back as CoreWeave used the money to buy Nvidia GPUs, accounting for 6-7% of Nvidia’s business. Being propped up by just two companies, Microsoft and Nvidia—the former of which is cooling on AI—does not seem like a position of strength.

Even worse, CoreWeave is suffocating under a heavy debt burden. Despite bringing in $1.9 billion in 2024 revenue, CoreWeave burned $6 billion last year and $1.1 billion the previous year because of the heavy expenses to build out its AI infrastructure. It has raised eyebrows in the past over carrying nearly $8 billion in debt and using the GPUs themselves as collateral, which certainly seems concerning as GPU prices decline and more efficient AI models require less resources. At the very least, CoreWeave is expected to raise around $1.46 billion in the public offering that will allow it to pay down some debt.

If CoreWeave continues to underwhelm in the days and weeks to come, that could cause problems for other AI companies hoping to go public. And they need it, too—investors demand returns, especially as few companies went public in recent years. Tech companies have fallen on their first of trading in the past only to rebound, so today is not necessarily a death knell for CoreWeave. President Trump’s tariff strategy has been hurting the broader stock market in recent days.

CoreWeave, if anything, could be seen as the first barometer of current market stress for GPUs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and others in the industry have argued that new “thinking” models require more resources, and as more consumers use AI, the demand for GPUs could continue to rise for years to come even as models become more efficient. But again, these are picks and shovels businesses; of course they will say you need more picks and shovels. OpenAI’s Sam Altman posted on X yesterday that demand for ChatGPT’s new image generator was “melting” GPUs. Whether that was a short-lived fad as people made novelty Studio Ghibli knockoffs, or something more sustainable, remains to be seen.

Either way, there is no doubt that CoreWeave seems to be on particularly shaky ground. What happens as chip prices continue to decline and major tech giants build their own Nvidia competitors in-house? Why then would CoreWeave be a $32 billion company, as it is expected to be valued on the first day of trading? And what if the AGI boom does not come to pass? This company has been propped up by excessive hype over the past two years, selling picks and shovels, before any other critical AI company has gone public and proven these products are more than glorified next-word predictors with the reliability of an unpaid intern.

“None of these companies are making any profit off of generative AI, and outside of OpenAI, there really isn’t the demand for these services,” said Ed Zitron, a public relations expert and host of Better Offline. “If there was, Microsoft wouldn’t have just pulled out of 2GW of future compute capacity.”

CoreWeave’s three founders will be fine either way. They cashed out $500 million of their holdings between 2023 and 2024.",gizmodo
https://wired.com,"If Anthropic Succeeds, a Nation of Benevolent AI Geniuses Could Be Born",https://wired.com/story/anthropic-benevolent-artificial-intelligence,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT","When Dario Amodei gets excited about AI—which is nearly always—he moves. The cofounder and CEO springs from a seat in a conference room and darts over to a whiteboard. He scrawls charts with swooping hockey-stick curves that show how machine intelligence is bending toward the infinite. His hand rises to his curly mop of hair, as if he’s caressing his neurons to forestall a system crash. You can almost feel his bones vibrate as he explains how his company, Anthropic, is unlike other AI model builders. He’s trying to create an artificial general intelligence—or as he calls it, “powerful AI”—that will never go rogue. It’ll be a good guy, an usher of utopia. And while Amodei is vital to Anthropic, he comes in second to the company’s most important contributor. Like other extraordinary beings (Beyoncé, Cher, Pelé), the latter goes by a single name, in this case a pedestrian one, reflecting its pliancy and comity. Oh, and it’s an AI model. Hi, Claude!

Amodei has just gotten back from Davos, where he fanned the flames at fireside chats by declaring that in two or so years Claude and its peers will surpass people in every cognitive task. Hardly recovered from the trip, he and Claude are now dealing with an unexpected crisis. A Chinese company called DeepSeek has just released a state-of-the-art large language model that it purportedly built for a fraction of what companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic spent. The current paradigm of cutting-edge AI, which consists of multibillion-dollar expenditures on hardware and energy, suddenly seemed shaky.

Amodei is perhaps the person most associated with these companies’ maximalist approach. Back when he worked at OpenAI, Amodei wrote an internal paper on something he’d mulled for years: a hypothesis called the Big Blob of Compute. AI architects knew, of course, that the more data you had, the more powerful your models could be. Amodei proposed that that information could be more raw than they assumed; if they fed megatons of the stuff to their models, they could hasten the arrival of powerful AI. The theory is now standard practice, and it’s the reason why the leading models are so expensive to build. Only a few deep-pocketed companies could compete.

Now a newcomer, DeepSeek—from a country subject to export controls on the most powerful chips—had waltzed in without a big blob. If powerful AI could come from anywhere, maybe Anthropic and its peers were computational emperors with no moats. But Amodei makes it clear that DeepSeek isn’t keeping him up at night. He rejects the idea that more efficient models will enable low-budget competitors to jump to the front of the line. “It’s just the opposite!” he says. “The value of what you’re making goes up. If you’re getting more intelligence per dollar, you might want to spend even more dollars on intelligence!” Far more important than saving money, he argues, is getting to the AGI finish line. That’s why, even after DeepSeek, companies like OpenAI and Microsoft announced plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars more on data centers and power plants.

What Amodei does obsess over is how humans can reach AGI safely. It’s a question so hairy that it compelled him and Anthropic’s six other founders to leave OpenAI in the first place, because they felt it couldn’t be solved with CEO Sam Altman at the helm. At Anthropic, they’re in a sprint to set global standards for all future AI models, so that they actually help humans instead of, one way or another, blowing them up. The team hopes to prove that it can build an AGI so safe, so ethical, and so effective that its competitors see the wisdom in following suit. Amodei calls this the Race to the Top.

That’s where Claude comes in. Hang around the Anthropic office and you’ll soon observe that the mission would be impossible without it. You never run into Claude in the café, seated in the conference room, or riding the elevator to one of the company’s 10 floors. But Claude is everywhere and has been since the early days, when Anthropic engineers first trained it, raised it, and then used it to produce better Claudes. If Amodei’s dream comes true, Claude will be both our wing model and fairy godmodel as we enter an age of abundance. But here’s a trippy question, suggested by the company’s own research: Can Claude itself be trusted to play nice?

One of Amodei’s Anthropic cofounders is none other than his sister. In the 1970s, their parents, Elena Engel and Riccardo Amodei, moved from Italy to San Francisco. Dario was born in 1983 and Daniela four years later. Riccardo, a leather craftsman from a tiny town near the island of Elba, took ill when the children were small and died when they were young adults. Their mother, a Jewish American born in Chicago, worked as a project manager for libraries.",wired
https://wired.com,"Elon Musk’s xAI Acquires X, Because of Course",https://wired.com/story/xai-x-acquisition-deal/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 22:35:37 GMT","Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI has acquired his social media platform X in an all-stock transaction that values the company at $33 billion, including $12 billion worth of debt, the centibillionaire announced Friday. The sale comes just weeks after Musk reportedly raised an additional roughly $1 billion in debt financing for X that valued the company at $44 billion—the same price Musk paid for it three years ago.

“xAI and X’s futures are intertwined,” Musk wrote in an X post. “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach.”

Both Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, and Igor Babuschkin, the cofounder of xAI, immediately posted similar messages on X signaling their support of the acquisition. “The future could not be brighter,” Yaccarino wrote. Musk only reposted Babuschkin’s.

It is not known whether Yaccarino will stay in the same role or what the acquisition will mean for X's employees. Musk, Yaccarino, and Robert Keele, the head of xAI’s legal team, did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication.

Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and later renamed it X in a deal that involved taking out billions of dollars in loans from a group of Wall Street banks and other lenders. After Musk took over and X’s advertising business slumped, the banks reportedly struggled to unload the loans to interested buyers. Lenders typically try to resell debt to other investors quickly to get it off their balance sheets and profit from associated fees. The Wall Street Journal dubbed the fiasco “the worst buyout for banks since the financial crisis.”

But X’s financial situation turned around after Donald Trump was reelected and Musk was appointed to run the administration’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency. More investors became interested in the debt as advertisers began returning and Musk’s ties to the White House and Trump deepened.

Musk also said he gave X investors a 25 percent stake in xAI last year, which helped boost the value of the social media platform and provide more security to lenders, according to reporting from the Financial Times.

Got a Tip? Are you a current or former X employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at zoeschiffer.87.

While xAI previously appeared to be mostly playing catch-up with rivals like OpenAI and Google, Musk gave the startup a boost by creating a massive cluster of 100,000 GPUs, enough computing resources to compete with the biggest industry players. The supercomputer, dubbed Colossus, is located in Memphis, Tennessee.

At the outset, xAI’s stated mission was to understand the nature of the universe. Today, it is best known for creating an “unfiltered” chatbot called Grok, which has been integrated as part of the X platform since late 2023.",wired
https://wired.com,Far-Right Influencers Are Hosting a $10K-per-Person Matchmaking Weekend to Repopulate the Earth,https://wired.com/story/natal-conference-matchmaking/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 20:41:53 GMT","Organizers behind a pronatalist conference with far-right ties in Austin, Texas, this weekend have set up matchmaking events for attendees that include the option of getting married onsite as part of their greater effort to repopulate the world, WIRED has learned.

According to its website, the sold-out Natal Conference, taking place March 28-29 at a hotel operated by the University of Texas at Austin, has “no political or ideological goal other than a world in which our children can have grandchildren.” But the event, an earlier version of which was promoted by Elon Musk, features speakers like Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec and Crémieux, an online pseudonym linked, according to The Guardian, to Jordan Lasker, who discusses falling birthrates and promotes eugenics.

Natal Conference organizer Kevin Dolan, a father of at least six, according to Politico, has previously stated that eugenics—the belief that white people are genetically superior—and the pronatalist movement are “very much aligned.”

Publicly available details about the Natal Conference are scant, with the vague online conference agenda promising closed-door sessions to address collapsing birth rates.

However, an email obtained by WIRED promoting a preconference mixer held Thursday night reveals matchmaking may play a significant role at the conference and in the pronatalist movement more widely.

“This is a special email to NatalCon attendees who indicated they were highly interested in finding the missing puzzle piece for singles, matchmaking, marriage, and family formation,” reads the email, sent by an event producer named Luke, who did not sign with his last name.

“We were stunned to receive many emails saying, ‘NatalCon needs to be focusing on this, right now!’ And we're here to serve you. This is coming from all sectors: singles, parents with dating-age children, grandparents, newlyweds that want to help their friends start families, and more,” the email said.

Attendees are instructed to register to learn the exact venue (though it is listed elsewhere on the website), and registration was listed as costing $10,000 for the full weekend—an increase from earlier this year when the cost was 90 percent cheaper. (A Saturday-only ticket is $500.) Last year’s VIP package was $1,000, according to the NatalCon website. After credit card details are handed over, organizers vet potential attendees, requiring them to submit their social media handles. The website says prospective attendees aren’t charged unless they’re approved.

NatalCon organizers, including Dolan, did not respond to messages from WIRED seeking comment.

Single registrants are directed to fill out a survey that asks their desired number of children (listing 1 to over 7 as options), “religious, spiritual, cultural, lifestyle” values, and whether they would be open to a “Q&A with a NatalCon speaker to introduce yourself to the room.”

Speaking to Edward Dutton—who has been described as a “proponent of pseudo-scientific ‘race science,’” by anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate—on a Jolly Heretic podcast in 2023, Dolan described his alma mater, Brigham Young University, as a “breeding program” for smart Mormons. He said his pronatalist events are a counter to the “perverse incentives in the dating app market.”",wired
https://wired.com,"DOGE Plans to Rebuild SSA Code Base in Months, Risking Benefits and System Collapse",https://wired.com/story/doge-rebuild-social-security-administration-cobol-benefits/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:07:09 GMT","The so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is starting to put together a team to migrate the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) computer systems entirely off one of its oldest programming languages in a matter of months, potentially putting the integrity of the system—and the benefits on which tens of millions of Americans rely—at risk.

The project is being organized by Elon Musk lieutenant Steve Davis, multiple sources who were not given permission to talk to the media tell WIRED, and aims to migrate all SSA systems off COBOL, one of the first common business-oriented programming languages, and onto a more modern replacement like Java within a scheduled tight timeframe of a few months.

Under any circumstances, a migration of this size and scale would be a massive undertaking, experts tell WIRED, but the expedited deadline runs the risk of obstructing payments to the more than 65 million people in the US currently receiving Social Security benefits.

“Of course, one of the big risks is not underpayment or overpayment per se; [it’s also] not paying someone at all and not knowing about it. The invisible errors and omissions,” an SSA technologist tells WIRED.

The Social Security Administration did not immediately reply to WIRED’s request for comment.

SSA has been under increasing scrutiny from president Donald Trump’s administration. In February, Musk took aim at SSA, falsely claiming that the agency was rife with fraud. Specifically, Musk pointed to data he allegedly pulled from the system that showed 150-year-olds in the US were receiving benefits, something that isn’t actually happening. Over the last few weeks, following significant cuts to the agency by DOGE, SSA has suffered frequent website crashes and long wait times over the phone, The Washington Post reported this week.

This proposed migration isn’t the first time SSA has tried to move away from COBOL: In 2017, SSA announced a plan to receive hundreds of millions in funding to replace its core systems. The agency predicted that it would take around five years to modernize these systems. Because of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the agency pivoted away from this work to focus on more public-facing projects.

Like many legacy government IT systems, SSA systems contain code written in COBOL, a programming language created in part in the 1950s by computing pioneer Grace Hopper. The Defense Department essentially pressured private industry to use COBOL soon after its creation, spurring widespread adoption and making it one of the most widely used languages for mainframes, or computer systems that process and store large amounts of data quickly, by the 1970s. (At least one DOD-related website praising Hopper's accomplishments is no longer active, likely following the Trump administration’s DEI purge of military acknowledgements.)

As recently as 2016, SSA’s infrastructure contained more than 60 million lines of code written in COBOL, with millions more written in other legacy coding languages, the agency’s Office of the Inspector General found. In fact, SSA’s core programmatic systems and architecture haven’t been “substantially” updated since the 1980s when the agency developed its own database system called MADAM, or the Master Data Access Method, which was written in COBOL and Assembler, according to SSA’s 2017 modernization plan.",wired

The Eero Pro 6E (7/10, WIRED Recommends) mesh system is one of the easiest to set up and will deliver speedy, stable Wi-Fi across your home. Amazon’s Eero makes some of our favorite mesh systems, ideal for busy families seeking a set-and-forget mesh. The Pro 6E is a tri-band system with a 6-GHz band for fast Wi-Fi at close range, and with the jump to Wi-Fi 7 systems still costly, this system is worth considering right now. But you need an Eero Plus subscription at $10 per month or $100 per year to unlock the best features, including parental controls, advanced security, and ad blocking. There are discounts on other Eero systems, so check our Eero buying guide to decide which is best for your home. —Simon Hill

DJI’s debut portable power station can put out 2,200 watts steadily (2,600 watts surge), has two USB-C PD 3.1 ports (140 watts), and boasts DJI’s proprietary SDC ports for fast-charging drone batteries. It can juice up phones, run microwaves or small tools, and meet most of your portable power needs, but it’s an especially great choice for folks with DJI drones because it can fast charge most models. It gets a little noisy with several gadgets charging, and cable and bag accessories cost extra, but it still claims a place in our best portable power stations guide. —Simon Hill

Built to last, this braided nylon cable’s exterior is 100 percent recycled plastic that Anker promises will last a century. It can operate in temperatures from -40 degrees to 176 degrees Fahrenheit. The ribbed cuffs make it easy to grip for plugging and unplugging, it has USB-IF certification, and it comes with a lifetime warranty. One of the best USB-C cables for charging a wide range of gadgets, the Anker Prime can supply up to 240 watts, making it suitable for laptops, smartphones, and anything else with a USB-C port. —Simon Hill

This is our favorite budget option in our guide to Best Webcams. Unlike the original version, it doesn’t come with an integrated right light but its software makes up for it with great automatic white balance and color saturation. It shoots 1080p resolution video at 30 frames per second or 720p resolution at 60 frames per second. Meanwhile the field of vision is a slightly wide 82 degrees. The built-in mics aren’t the best though, so we suggest sticking to the ones on your laptop or snag a USB microphone. You can also tinker with the video settings via the Razer Synapse app. —Brenda Stolyar

This Qi2 power bank can wirelessly charge at up to 15 watts, but there’s also a built-in USB-C cable that can deliver up to 30 watts, and it supports several charging protocols (PD 3.0, PPS, and QC 3.0). There’s a wee kickstand to prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation for Apple's StandBy feature. It’s fairly slim and compact and will boost the battery inside most iPhones, or Qi2 Android phones, by around 50 to 80 percent. —Simon Hill

Ugreen's charger can supply up to 145 watts (one USB-C port at 100 W and the other at 45 W), which very few power banks can do. The ample 25,000 mAh battery will keep all your gadgets topped up and is safe to fly with in your carry-on. It’s a solid option for fast-charging phones, tablets, or even laptops (although it doesn't support Samsung's fast-charging tech). A small LED shows the current charge state of the battery, and it comes with a USB-C cable. —Simon Hill

A classic among podcasters and gamers, the Blue Yeti is a great-sounding microphone that suits virtually every need you’ll have. A steep discount makes this a must-buy for anyone who is mic shopping this spring, given that these usually retail for well over $100. I like that these have physical controls on the microphone, which makes it easy to mute and adjust volume on the fly. —Parker Hall

I hate using clip-on reading lights because I always feel like they’re too top-heavy. So, I was excited to find this one that wraps around your neck. It’s lightweight and comfortable to wear for long reading sessions—once you get past how funny it looks. It also offers three color temperature modes including yellow, warm white, and cool. You’ll also have six brightness settings to pick from that you can cycle through with a button. It offers up to 80 hours of battery life at dimmer settings too. —Brenda Stolyar

I’m not entirely sold on the necessity of XR (mixed reality) or augmented reality glasses. But Viture has done the best job of finding a legitimate use for them: a portable gaming display you can take anywhere. The original Viture One XR Glasses (6/10, WIRED Review) were okay, but the Viture Pro boasts a slightly larger virtual screen (135 inches), a smoother 120-Hz frame rate, and a far higher maximum brightness of 4,000 nits. Virtue has also done a nice job with the software, and the experience is tailored for gamers, though various accessories may be required, depending on your platform of choice. You can also use these glasses for multitasking work or watching movies, though the Harman-tuned speakers are limited. —Simon Hill

When Amazon updated its entire Kindle lineup, that did not exclude the Kindle versions for kids. My kids have tested the Kindle kids’ versions since they came out in 2019, and to my eye, the new Kindle Kids and Kindle Kids Paperwhite are both noticeably faster and clearer than the old versions. If you’re spending all your money buying comic books, I suggest the Kindle Kids Paperwhite, which is bigger and better for reading graphic novels. It’s also waterproof and, like all Amazon kid devices, comes with a two-year worry-free warranty. —Adrienne So

This is the best Kindle (8/10, WIRED Review) for note-taking and reading. It comes with a 10.2-inch (300 ppi) paperlike display, white borders that mimic writing on a traditional piece of paper, and a Premium Pen that has a soft-tipped eraser similar to that of a No. 2 pencil. It also packs features like Active Canvas (where you can write directly within the book you’re reading), expandable margins, and a couple of artificial intelligence tools including Refined Writing (that transforms your notes into a script font) and Summarization (which summarizes your notes). —Brenda Stolyar

This is the best Amazon tablet for younger children. It has all the same features as Amazon’s standard Fire tablets, but you’ll also get a rugged case and a two-year replacement guarantee. It also comes with a free year of Amazon Kids+, which gives you access to kid-friendly movies, books, apps, and games. You can manage the parental controls on the device as well. —Scott Gilbertson

The main difference between the Fire HD Kids and Fire HD Kids Pro tablets is the protective case. The Pro version has a less protective case and is aimed at older kids less likely to drop it. The Pro version still has the same two-year warranty though, so if it does hit the floor, you’re covered. —Scott Gilbertson

The Fire HD 10 Pro Kid’s Edition is the same as the normal Fire HD 10, but it comes with a handy protective case (with kickstand), one year of Amazon Kids+, and, most importantly, a no-questions-asked warranty for when your kids accidentally drop it. Parental controls on Amazon’s tablets are limited but offer some control over content (see our guide for more details). —Scott Gilbertson

This cute little smart plug works with every smart home speaker you could hope for, letting you invest without worrying that it won’t work for whichever voice assistant you might fancy in the future. It’s my favorite smart plug for Apple HomeKit users, though it’ll work well for Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant users, too. It’s got a nice small form factor so you won’t block the other outlet, and this four-pack makes it easy to transform an entire room (or a small apartment) into a full smart home. —Nena Farrell

This extreme alarm clock is truly one of the most annoying things I’ve ever dealt with. Which is a good thing if you need something to motivate you to get your butt out of bed. This robotlike alarm clock on wheels rolls away from you, falling from whatever surface you put it on and randomly rolls wherever (under your bed, behind your dresser—all of the hardest places to reach), so you’re forced to physically get out of bed and turn it off. Right now, it’s the lowest price we’ve seen all year. If you’re like me and have slept through a fire alarm, it's a solid way to get you moving in the morning. —Molly Higgins

The Roxicosly clock is one of the most reviewed nontraditional alarm clocks on Amazon. It’s semi-customizable, with the buzzer going up to 106 decibels and a bed shaker that can be used separately or together with the alarm. The vibrations provide a more subtle way to wake up by forgoing the jarring alarm sounds, and the escalating pattern of the buzzing helps ease the snoozer into wakefulness. The vibrations, along with the noise and adjustable intensity, helped me wake up more easily than other buzzing alarms I’ve tried, and at $18, it’s one of the lowest prices we’ve seen for it this year. —Molly Higgins

Tushy makes some of the best budget electric bidets, and the Classic 3.0 is a great choice for any bathroom—renters included—since it’s a small accessory that doesn’t require any additional power and can be added to just about any toilet. For having no electricity added, it’s got impressive water power and a nice range of finishes so you can select the one that best matches your bathroom’s vibe. —Nena Farrell

This excellent cordless vacuum has fallen to $550 before, but it rarely drops below $600 (and doesn’t go on sale super often). It’s the best Dyson for most people, boasting all the features you need (like strong suction, a 60-minute run time, and a few different attachments). It also has a neon green laser that lights up the floor in front of the vacuum head, which can help you spot dust particles that you might’ve missed otherwise. —Louryn Strampe

The Dyson V15s Detect Submarine is one of our favorite Dyson vacuums overall. It’s got a wet roller head and drip tray built in, which makes it both a vacuum and a mop. It can clean about 1,000 square feet on one charge and water tank fill, with up to an hour of run time and around 4.5 hours to recharge the battery. If you want a wet/dry vacuum that isn’t a robot, this is a great deal on Dyson’s offering. —Louryn Strampe

True Classic’s white tee is snug in the right places, and relaxed everywhere else. Editor Jeremy White appreciates the “dad bod” fit and says the neckline is just right. WIRED UK managing editor Mike Dent admits he’d probably wear it to death as pajamas. It is a 60/40 cotton-poly bend, meaning it’s not the most sustainable choice and is more likely to pill. Still, at $25, it’s a solid tee that won’t make you look like an extra in an early aughts music video. —Boutayna Chokrane

I recently wrote an article about how much I love Comfort Colors t-shirts, which are slowly displacing every other t-shirt in my closet. Doing so is not exactly cost-prohibitive at their standard offering price of around $10 on Amazon, but the Big Spring Sale is dropping them a bit. It's like getting a free shirt for every five you buy! —Martin Cizmar

They’re soft. They’re fun. They’re serotonin for your feet. These TikTok-approved smiley slippers are designed with memory foam cushioning, a fuzzy upper, and a nonslip sole for padding inside and outside the house. They’re not the most durable, but for $13, they’ll keep your toes cozy and your mood (hopefully slightly) boosted. —Boutayna Chokrane

Dyson loves to make beautiful, techy-looking, almost self-consciously expensive devices. This is why I’d always recommend waiting for a good sale before buying one. Luckily, this is a doozy, knocking $200 off the list price on one of our favorite portable heaters and fans. This model is basically an all-things-to-all people air-changing doohickey par excellence. The HP07 is a space heater with an energy-saving, accurate thermostat that’ll also work as a fan, an air quality monitor, and an air purifying filter. It’s a little loud if you turn the fan up, but among portable space heaters, it’s also the most sophisticated air management system I’ve tested. —Matthew Korfhage

We are now approaching the great robot vacuum convergence, where all manufacturers agree that somewhere between $500 and $1,000 is the sweet spot for a multifunctional robot vacuum mop. The Eufy X10 Pro Omni was our top pick in this spot last year, but it got edged out by slightly cheaper models; still, at the sale price, this is still a great robot vacuum whose AI navigation helps it map quickly and efficiently (and provides some comic relief in the process). —Adrienne So

Yeedi is the affordable sub-brand of Ecovacs, which also makes many robot vacuums that we like. The company offers a broad array of robot vacuum/mops at a wide range of prices. This one is the midrange model, and I did find that it navigated better than the cheaper versions. There are a few other standout features besides the very good price—the clean/dirty water tanks are absolutely ginormous, so you can go much longer without refilling them, and it has an extendable arm to get in all the little nooks and crannies. —Adrienne So

Tineco makes some great floor cleaning gadgets—I was vacuuming my entire house with the Pure One Station 5 before writing this—including a fantastic carpet cleaner. The Tineco Carpet One Pro is our favorite upgrade-worthy carpet cleaner, but it’s on sale right now for nearly half the price, making it the perfect time to snap one up for yourself. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano describes the Carpet One Pro as as much fun as you can hope from a carpet cleaner, with a clever design that leaves the dirty water tank upright while you maneuver the cleaner and a big LED screen to see what mode you’re in. There’s an Auto, Max, and Drying mode, and it can leave white carpet looking like it’s brand-new. —Nena Farrell

Afina has two main benefits among the new crop of filtered showerheads that promise to filter the chlorine out of the water that reaches your skin and hair. The first is its broad, flat showerhead that offers a lovely, even, spalike spray. The second is that unlike most of the showerheads I tested, Afina works quite well for the entire duration of its filter life. In part, this is because they recommend filter replacement every two months instead of every three months, at $30 a pop. But from our testing, this frequency amounts to a rare honesty. —Matthew Korfhage

After testing more than a dozen filters from a new generation of filtered showerhead brands, I can say this handsome little number from Canopy was one of the very few that could bring my total chlorine down to undetectable levels on my chloramine-treated water system. The filter—a mix of KDF-55, calcium sulfite, and granular activated carbon made from coconut shells—retains about half its efficacy throughout the three-month life of the filter, not a bad record compared to others I’ve tested. What’s more, the thoughtful design offers easy installation, adjustable spray, and even aromatherapy diffusers if that’s your steez. This is almost the lowest price we’ve seen over the past 12 months, and the handheld version is also on sale. —Matthew Korfhage

This family favorite frequently comes out when we have people over because it’s so easy to pick up and play, and it’s fun. Each round is based on a single word from a category card determined by a dice roll, but while everyone else knows the word, the chameleon has to bluff their way through. Each player says something associated with the word for that round, and the guesser has to decide who the chameleon is. It’s for up to eight players but is still fun for spectators. —Simon Hill

If you don’t want to worry about batteries in your smart video doorbell, the Reolink Video Doorbell is a great option that lets you wire it into your home, letting it stay powered on for years to come. Reolink has a simple app, an included chime, plus built-in speakers and a microphone. The camera displays 2K video and records to a microSD card, so you don’t need a cloud storage fee like other doorbells. —Nena Farrell

This body pillow is marketed for pregnant people, but as a non-pregnant person who is an exclusive side sleeper, it worked well for me. The pillow combines popular body- and pregnancy-pillow U and C shapes for a unique shape that provides total-body support no matter which side you sleep on—Momcozy even claims it helps those with pain like sciatica and fibromyalgia. Because of its unique shape that’s got your head and limbs covered, and at less than 40 bucks, this is really the only pillow you’ll need. Insider tip: It comes in multiple cover types, so I’d opt for a lighter cotton fabric cover if you sleep hot. —Molly Higgins

The Loftie Alarm Clock (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the prettiest bedside gadgets I’ve tried. The sleek alarm clock pairs with an app to let you create your alarms and access a variety of audio content to fall asleep to. There’s even a membership ($6 a month) that gives you access to personalized bedtime stories, meditations, and even your horoscope. There are also plenty of other standard sounds, like white noise and campfires, that you can access without the membership. The Loftie Alarm also has a little nightlight built into it that you can tap on and off, but it is pretty dim so it won’t double as a lamp or bedside light. Overall, it’s a really fun alarm clock, and it pairs with the beautiful Loftie Lamp (sadly not on sale) to become a sunrise alarm setup. —Nena Farrell

This cute little sound machine has a real physical fan inside of it to create the soothing fan noise you can fall asleep to. It only makes the one fan sound, so only get this if you don’t want variety and instead want one good, consistent fan sound. It has a nice fade-in and fade-out feature for timers, too. The only downside is how expensive it is for a single sound, but you can get it cheaper right now. —Nena Farrell

This is my favorite wearable breast pump I’ve ever tried. The Willow Go (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is well priced for a wearable breast pump and works great, and the clear exterior makes it easy to keep an eye on how your pump session is going. It has its own app from Willow, and you can also purchase Willow’s bras that are made to help hold a wearable pump. The pieces are nice and big making it easy to clean without losing something down the drain. It’s a bit of a splurge, though it’s often on sale for $280 (so this is still a better deal than you’d usually find!) —Nena Farrell

This is our budget recommendation in our Best Standing Desks guide. The EN1 has a somewhat complicated assembly but once it’s put together, it’s a reliable and affordable standing desk that does the job. You get four memory presets so that the desk can remember your favorite heights, and it can hold up to 154 pounds. —Julian Chokkattu

I love this tiny table. The frame is designed so that you can roll it under a bed or couch and the desktop will still be easy to access. You can raise it up and down via a lever manually, and the whole thing is on wheels so moving it around is a piece of cake. I’ve been using it for several years as a place for a little photo studio, with clamped-on lights, and it has worked flawlessly. It can hold 15 pounds. —Julian Chokkattu

This little desk accessory comes with magnetic clips you can attach to your cables. Those clips can then stay affixed to the magnetic base, which makes this a neat-freak’s solution to organizing those pesky wires. There’s a bigger version in case you have lots of cables at your desk or nightstand. —Julian Chokkattu

Any ol’ carbonator can carbonate. But this is a carbonator from Ninja, and so this one can’t merely add bubbles. It must also offer multiple levels of carbonation, and infuse your water with functional B-vitamin flavor pods that taste like dragonfruit or watermelon kiwi and promise to “hydrate” or fill you with energy. Anyway, it’s $50 off for the spring sale. And while we did like the SodaStream Enso more, this one costs half as much. —Matthew Korfhage

WIRED contributing reviewer Lisa Wood Shapiro was quite the fan (no pun intended) of this rectangular dehydrator’s fast mode—so much so that she crowned it Best for Those in a Hurry in our guide to the Best Food Dehydrators. It dried apple slices, kiwis, and banana chips in half the time of a typical dehydrator cycle, as viewable through the machine’s large glass window. Lisa was also impressed by its quiet fan and dishwasher-safe stainless steel trays. As the longtime owner of a Nesco dehydrator with infuriatingly difficult-to-clean plastic trays, I can confirm the trays alone make this a worthwhile investment. —Kat Merck

There’s a lot to like about this excellent-value bread machine, top pick in our guide to the Best Bread Makers. It’s got all the same bells and whistles as higher-end models, including 17 preset programs, a delay timer, and a fruit-and-nut dispenser, and it can turn out loaves in three different sizes, as opposed to the usual one or two. Its ceramic pan is free of nonstick coatings and potential PFOAs and can be run through the dishwasher for easy cleaning. The recipe book leaves something to be desired in terms of variety and readability (and quality of the recipes in general—I recommend looking elsewhere online; some KBS-owning Redditors have had success with King Arthur recipes). The stirring/kneading cycle is also louder than it needs to be, but otherwise, this is a worry-free choice if you’re in the market for set-it-and-forget it homemade bread. —Kat Merck

Look, for sheer performance, we might go with a KitchenAid. But for value, we already recommend this Aucma even at full price. It goes on sale fairly often, but this is a better deal than most on this 1,400-watt device, which boasts useful little features like a splash guard on its tilt head, and basic functions like six speeds and a pulse function. Attachments include whisk, beater, and dough hook, plus a 6-liter and 5-liter bowl. If you just want a mixer that’ll bother some batter, and you don’t want to spend $200-plus on top-line stand mixers and all their elegant frippery, this is your little lower-priced stand mixer workhorse, briefly priced even lower. —Matthew Korfhage

The Breville Smart Oven Pro is the workhorse model in Breville’s lineup of Lexus toaster ovens, hanging out at the sweet spot of affordability and execution. It’s one I’ll recommend to those who want a Breville oven but balk at the price of the top-pick Joule: It heats evenly, keeps temperature beautifully, and offers a standard array of baking, toasting, broiling, and light convection that nonetheless definitely is not air frying. The slight curve in its geometry means you can fit a 13-inch pizza pan inside, a 5-quart Dutch oven, or a 12-by-12 square pan. Anyway, Breville doles out sales sparingly, and this little corker is $50 off for the spring sale. —Matthew Korfhage

This little countertop pizza oven made the rounds on TikTok last year for being so cute, compact, and relatively affordable. Astonishingly, its claims of heating to 800 degrees Fahrenheit on the top and bottom heating element are accurate and it takes about 15 minutes! The top heating element doesn’t cover the whole pizza and it loses heat very quickly, since it opens like a waffle maker. Still, this is a nice housewarming present for a pizza lover. I also use it to heat up tortillas and pitas for dinner. —Adrienne So

Photograph: Aeropress

It’s not a secret: AeroPress is the best and easiest and most lovely coffee maker that can fit in a literal pocket, assuming you’ve got deep pockets. The original version is already the default option for countless hotel room and campsite self-caffeinators. The newer Go travel version is even more lightweight, self-contained, and remains beautifully customizable to your own perfect taste. For now, it’s quite a bit cheaper: more than a third off the list price. —Matthew Korfhage

This stainless steel beauty goes on sale reasonably often, but this is still a great deal on a handsome stainless steel French press that forgoes both microplastics and frangible glass (whose shards shall henceforth be referred to as micro-glass.) I’ve been hunting down non-plastic alternatives for pretty much everything in my kitchen: With everything made of steel right down to the coffee maker filters, Mueller is a strong entrant on my list, and WIRED’s favorite pick among stainless steel French press. —Matthew Korfhage

I found these ramekins to be supremely helpful while testing meal kits for work. You see TV chefs using tiny ramekins and bowls all the time, and as it turns out, they know what they’re doing. Whipping up a compound butter? Tiny bowls! Zesting a lemon before juicing it? Tiny bowls. Separating the white and green halves of a green onion? Tiny. Bowls. They’re also handy when baking individual desserts, such as the lava cakes my partner became obsessed with last year. Get some tiny bowls! —Louryn Strampe

The Instant Pot Vortex Plus is the best air fryer we’ve tried. This usually sells for between $140 and $90, and we’ve only seen it drop below this price a few times before. It keeps temperature precisely and it manages to crisp up food without stripping away moisture. The basket preheats quickly and the simple display is intuitive. Reviewer Matthew Korfhage also appreciated the fact that the controls don’t beep—the simple dial keeps things quiet.

This consistently popular hair-straightening comb was not the answer for members of our team with super thick and curly hair, but for those whose hair is easy to straighten or simply wavy, it’s definitely worth considering for the price and ease of use. The outer shell that covers the hot teeth is safer than a traditional flat iron and enables users to get closer to their roots than they would otherwise, which is great for tamping down flyaways. The brush is also reasonably lightweight at under 1 pound, in case you’d want to use it for travel. Also note that it comes with a black-and-pink heat-resistant glove, which apparently is to use on your hair and not actually on the tool, as former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found out the hard way. —Kat Merck

This is the original “upgrade” hair straightener that changed the flat iron game for many (including myself) when it was released in 2006, and it’s still going strong today. Former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber tried it for our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners and says it still lives up to the hype. It only heats to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, but it does so in seconds and requires minimal passes. Woollaston-Webber says the outer plastic does get hot while styling, so it may not be the best pick for younger users, but if that doesn’t bother you this is still the best deal on a solid hair straightener you’ll find for $50. —Kat Merck

The Aquasonic Black Series is not for the weak-gummed. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found the vibrations a little overwhelming—the whole body buzzes more than the bristles themselves. But if you love that ultra-deep-clean sensation, this is a steal at $30. Plus, you get eight replacement heads, which would cost more than the brush itself with some brands. If you’d prefer a gentler toothbrush, you might be better off with a Sonicare or Bitvae, which are also on sale. —Boutayna Chokrane

The Tymo Airflow is a great two-in-one tool, letting you both curl and straighten your hair with the same device. I love it for my fine hair, and I think it shines best as a straightener, though it can do some nice soft curls. There’s 3D floating plates, a ceramic finish, and a rounded form factor that makes it look like a curler, but opens up like a straightener. There’s five heat options ranging from 284 to 428 degrees Fahrenheit, and Tymo has a guide on which to choose based on your hair type. —Nena Farrell

If oscillating toothbrushes feel too intense on your gums, the Philips Sonicare 4100 Electric Toothbrush is a gentler powerhouse. You get a pressure sensor that reduces vibrations when you’re brushing too hard, a two-minute timer, and two intensity settings (low and high). A single charge lasts about two weeks, and it’s designed with BrushSync technology that tracks how long (and hard) you’ve been brushing and will remind you when it’s time to replace the head. Normally $50—now $40—this is the best midrange electric toothbrush we’ve tested. —Boutayna Chokrane

If you’re still scraping your tongue with your toothbrush, it’s time for MasterMedi Tongue Scraper. This stainless steel scraper is way more effective, easier to clean, and won’t snap in half like plastic versions. This two-pack comes with individual cases (one for home, one for your travel kit). While it’s technically dishwasher-safe, just rinse it like an adult. At $8, it’s a small price to pay for a fresher mouth. —Boutayna Chokrane

Manscaped is more famous for its groin-taming Lawn Mower trimmer, but never-nudes take heart: You can keep it above the neck with a Beard Hedger whose small stainless steel teeth and high RPMs make it great for shorter beards, according to WIRED contributing reviewer Andrew Williams. A small amount of give in the trimmer’s plastic guide means the Hedger offers a quite close shave. While this isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen, 25 percent off is a solid deal on this trimmer. —Matthew Korfhage

The Fancii Abigail (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite lighted makeup mirror for traveling. It measures nearly 8 inches across and it’s easy to transport in a backpack or weekender. Unfurl the flat disc to reveal a mirror that can be used compact-style or raised up on a stand and angled all sorts of directions. The ring light around the mirror is bright, but it doesn’t take up too much of the reflective surface, and there are three light temperature settings to choose from. The interface is simple and the mirror stays closed reliably. It also recharges pretty quickly via USB-C, and the battery lasts for about 10 hours on one charge. If you’re frequently applying your makeup on the go, or you’re sick of terrible hotel bathroom lighting ruining your glam, this price is too good to pass up (in my personal and very experienced opinion). —Louryn Strampe

If TikTok’s raving about it, I’m skeptical, but experts back this trend up. Snail mucin is packed with glycoproteins and hyaluronic acid—but don’t expect overnight miracles. This gooey essence hydrates, soothes, and leaves skin looking plump without feeling greasy. I slather on the Cosrx Advanced Snail Mucin 96 Percent Power Repairing Essence Serum nightly after cleansing. At $18, it’s a decent time to snag a bottle or stock up, though we’ve seen the price dip lower before. —Boutayna Chokrane

These cute little stars that went viral on TikTok are hydrocolloid patches that can help heal pimples. The material attracts water, which helps flatten zits and suck out all the gross stuff inside them. It’s weirdly satisfying to use them, and it’s also empowering, transforming a blemish into an accessory. Pimple patches are usually affordable. The reason I personally like and use Starface patches is because they come in a cute storage case with a little mirror, which helps when I feel hormonal acne cropping up while I’m out and about. Refills are affordable, too. —Louryn Strampe

Micellar water is a godsend for those people who are sometimes too lazy to fully wash their faces at night. (It’s me, I’m people.) Simply douse a cotton pad with this magical solution and swipe it over your face for easy makeup removal and a cleaner feeling than oil-based makeup wipes can provide. I especially like using this sensitive-skin formula for travel since I don’t have to rinse my face after using it, making it ideal for camping trips or overnight car rides. I first received it in a beauty box, but it’s affordable and easy to find (and I don’t have to pour my fancy cleanser into a TSA-approved bottle, either). —Louryn Strampe

I admit I had never before seen or heard of Electrolit until a recent family summer vacation in Las Vegas, when my husband, son, and I made the ill-fated decision to walk the entirety of the Strip during a 115-degree-Fahrenheit heat wave. The Pedialyte-looking bottle was an immediate grab from the cooler at Target, and not only tasted like fruit punch, it quite literally saved my life. The powdered packets taste similar, if not a bit stronger, with vivid hues from artificial food coloring. The company has been around for more than 70 years—before Liquid IV, before even Pedialyte—so if you’re looking for an electrolyte beverage that both looks and tastes like the ’80s, this is your chance to score a great deal on an eight-pack. —Kat Merck

This topped our list of the Best Smart Scales. It quickly and accurately assesses not only your weight but your heart rate, fat and muscle measurements, vascular age, and more. The companion smartphone app is also easy to use. The scale can track data for up to eight users, and the AAA batteries last for over a year. If you’re trying to keep an eye on how your body changes over time, this scale is an investment worth considering. —Louryn Strampe

If you’ve been eyeing a Theragun but can’t stomach the price tag, a massage gun under $50 is almost unheard of. The LifePro Sonic also comes with an absurd number of attachments (eight): a round head for sore muscles, a shovel for back pain, a flat tip for a deep tissue massage, a pointer for sensitive knots, a bullet for small muscles, a fingertip for trigger points, spinal for lower back, and a textured tip for larger muscles. It’s not the lightest at 2.5 pounds, but for the price, this tool is an excellent addition to your gym setup or post-workout recovery routine. —Boutayna Chokrane

Best Mobile Phone Deals (Plus Accessories)

The Google Pixel 9 Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite Android phones, and this deal is one of the best prices we’ve tracked so far. This super-smart smartphone is packed with a spate of AI features that make your day-to-day life easier—including Direct My Call (which helps you navigate automated menu options), a ton of photo editing tools, Circle to Search, and more. The Pixel 9 Pro has an excellent camera, plus a vapor-chamber cooling system that helps dissipate heat better than other phones we’ve tried (and other phones in the Pixel 9 lineup). The phone will get software upgrades for seven years. Don’t forget a case! —Louryn Strampe

The Nubia Redmagic 10 Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) is a mobile gaming beast with excellent battery life, silky performance, and a lovely 6.8-inch screen with a 144-Hz refresh rate. Relatively affordable for a phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, this device is all about gaming and includes a built-in fan to keep cool, programmable buttons, and highly customizable gaming software. Shoddy software, limited updates, and an inconsistent camera are downsides, but this is real value for gamers, especially at the discounted price. —Simon Hill

The best smart display to invest in isn’t technically a smart display, but a tablet. The Google Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is an Android tablet with a speaker docking station, letting it transform into a powerful little smart display when you aren’t using the tablet. It’s got good performance, a sharp LCD screen, and robust speakers. Both the tablet with the docking station and the tablet alone are on sale, but this tablet really shines when you’re able to use it all day long. It’s a better deal for the included speaker, too, versus the tablet alone. The Google Pixel has been running my smart home devices for months, and I have no desire to go back to a smart-display-only gadget in my house. —Nena Farrell

This is our favorite ultrathin case in our guide to the Best iPhone 16 cases. It’s composed of 100 percent biodegradable packaging with a woven aramid fiber that adds a super soft feel. Despite its thin design, it comes with MagSafe built in, too. It also comes in some fun patterns. It’s worth noting the buttons are exposed, so if that’s a concern, I suggest going for another case. This one will keep the back of your phone safe from scratches, but it won’t do much to protect your display if you drop it. —Brenda Stolyar

It has occasionally dipped a little lower, but this is a solid price on Samsung’s latest smartwatch. It’s best paired with a Samsung phone to access a few extra features, like the electrocardiogram and FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, but will otherwise work with all Android phones. Performance is smooth, the health tracking is excellent, but battery life is a little annoying—it’ll just about enough to get through a day, not much more. I recommend grabbing the 44-mm variant; it’s a bit bigger but that means better battery life. —Julian Chokkattu

Testing Google’s Pixel Watch 3 is the first time I believed editor Julian Chokkattu when he said “round is better than square.” It’s one of the best-looking smartwatches and one of the best-looking fitness trackers for anyone with an Android phone. I recommend staying with this larger 45-mm model for better battery life, especially if you work out a lot. I have mixed feelings about the AI coaching features, but Fitbit is still one of the best fitness platforms available and Google’s integration with it is virtually perfect. —Adrienne So

Want a big, premium smartwatch for your Android phone? Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Ultra (7/10, WIRED Review) is the Apple Watch Ultra equivalent, with a beefy screen and battery. It has better navigational features like Track Back and a compass to accurately find your way back to camp, and you get two days of battery life—extendable if you turn on power saving mode. You can even submerge it up to 100 meters. —Julian Chokkattu

This tiny little 1080p projector from XGIMI is one of my favorite portable projectors because it’s so easy to set up. You can get a battery-impregnated stand and plug it straight into the projector, which is about the size and shape of a Stanley water cup. It has a cute little speaker on the bottom and can even flip up to shoot images at the ceiling, which makes it fun to add ambience when you’re not watching shows and movies. —Parker Hall

Beats took its time renewing its popular Pill Bluetooth speaker, but the wait was worth it. The latest Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) offers a posh design, great sound, and loads of features, from solid water resistance to a USB-C input for lossless audio playback. Its zippy sound signature goes heavy on the bass and treble but both are presented with care and musicality, and its mix of keen instrumental textures and stereo separation place it among the top performers in its class. The Pill’s stylish frame isn’t as drop-friendly as rivals from JBL or UE, but at $100 this is an easy decision for anyone eyeing a solid Bluetooth buddy. —Ryan Waniata

These perfectly sized speakers will bring a rich, clear sound to your desktop. They come in black or white with angled stands to fire the audio into your ears. Our current pick of the best computer speakers under $200, the M60 speakers are already a bargain, so this discount makes them irresistible for anyone in the market. While they offer decent bass, it can get a bit muddy, and the touch controls are slightly annoying, but that’s it for weaknesses. Connectivity choices include USB-C (which will be best for most folks), 3.5 mm, or Bluetooth 5.3. —Simon Hill

Ultimate Ears’ Megaboom is my favorite big-boy speaker. Its larger size means it’s not the easiest to throw in a backpack, but it is up for any adventure thanks to a drop- and weather-proof frame and great sound. I like Ultimate Ears’ app that lets you customize speaker options like an alarm or the ability to wake the speaker from sleep right from your phone. The sound is powerful and full, with plenty of detail, and the playtime of up to 20 hours should keep you jamming in all but the most extended excursions. This speaker sees regular sales, sometimes below this price, but if you’re ready to grab your next patio companion now’s a good time. —Ryan Waniata

The Everboom is a solid offering from Ultimate Ears, one of our favorite Bluetooth speaker makers. The only real issue I took with the speaker in my Everboom review is that its sound quality and features are remarkably similar to the Megaboom 4, which costs $50 less. Issue resolved! If you’re looking for a powerful and uniquely designed Bluetooth speaker with loads of extras to pump up your outdoor jams, at $200 or less the Everboom is a solid choice. —Ryan Waniata

This isn’t a sale so much as the new regular price, but anytime you can get this speaker at $60 or less it’s well worth considering. I like its smooth and warm sound that pays good attention to detail. I love its ultra-portable design that easily clips to shower attachments, branches, belt loops, etc. The Clip is durable and its IP67 dust and water resistance means it works easily as well as a shower speaker or chilling at the beach. —Ryan Waniata

These cheap buds from Nothing are some of our favorite earbuds under $100. They have excellent design; a comfortable, Airpods Pro-like fit; and quality sound and noise canceling technology. If you’re after a pair that look good and that you don’t need to worry about, start here. —Parker Hall

If you own an Android phone, this is a fantastic pair of cheap earbuds (8/10, WIRED Recommends) to pair with it. They quick-pair to all Android devices, and they have a super comfortable and stable design that will keep them in your ears even during the most strenuous workouts. I also like the charging case, which is a cute little egg that slides easily into pockets and bags. —Parker Hall

Soundcore’s Liberty 4 NC (8/10, WIRED Recommends) aren’t just another AirPods clone. They’re another AirPods Pro clone, and a good one at that, offering excellent battery life, clear and detailed sound, and tons of customization options at a fraction of what you’ll pay for Apple’s best buds. You’re not getting Apple’s exclusive features, of course, but if you want a great experience with stem-style buds for less, this is one of my favorite pairs. The customization in Soundcore’s app alone is nearly worth the entry fee, and the buds themselves are well-built and comfy. I had a few problems with the touch controls, but otherwise it’s hard to criticize buds that rise above their price point in nearly every way that counts. —Ryan Waniata

Sony WH-1000MX5 Photograph: Sony

We see this discount frequently, but we’d be remiss not to include it here since it’s the best deal we see for the best headphones we’ve tried. Of the dozens, if not hundreds, of pairs of headphones our reviewers have tested, the WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take the cake in terms of battery life (30 hours), sound quality (thanks to Sony processing and 30-mm drivers), and noise cancelation (complete with automatic audio pausing).—Louryn Strampe

The Pixel Buds Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are the best wireless earbuds for Android owners. They’re small and cute, with a supremely comfortable fit and fantastic noise canceling. The battery lasts for eight hours and the sound quality is great, too. They even have IP54 water resistance, so you can take ’em to the gym. It’s not hard to find a good inexpensive pair of earbuds these days, but we don’t see these go on sale very often, making now a better time to pick them up.—Louryn Strampe

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it many times again, I’m sure: Anker’s Soundcore line makes a mean budget headphone. The Space A40 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) noise-canceling buds are longtime favorites for their mix of clear and full sound, solid mid-tier noise cancelation, and plenty of features rolled into a comfy design. The biggest argument against these buds is their lack of auto-pause, which means you’ll need to stay on your toes when you pull a bud out during your favorite true crime podcast. Otherwise, it’s hard to argue against their value, especially since their price has sunk like a stone to nearly half their original MSRP. —Ryan Waniata

Photograph: Amazon

A sale on the Life Q30 is really just doubling down on value. Even at full price, these rank among the best noise-canceling headphones I’ve tested for the money. Along with solid noise canceling, highlights include a comfy design, a great companion app, and up to 40 hours of playtime. I’ve taken these headphones on a cross-country flight and had no trouble enjoying my favorite music and movies thanks to their ability to quell engine drone and background noise. The soft plastic tends to scratch easily and they don’t have all the features of top models like the Bose QC Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends) or Sony XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), but at a fraction of the cost, they’re a guilt-free budget buy. —Ryan Waniata

This is a less exciting deal now that the new Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 have come out. But if you’re an Apple user who doesn’t want to spend $250, then Beats’ previous headphones topped our Best Workout Headphones guide for years. (When they were released, we even called them “Apple’s best earbuds ever.”) They’re insanely comfortable, have great battery life and an excellent sound signature, work well with all Apple devices, and despite a modest IPX4 rating, are hardy and durable. I dunked my head under a hose at full blast while wearing them and they were fine. —Adrienne So

If I had to buy my own workout headphones instead of testing them, I would probably buy a pair of the Shokz OpenRuns in any of the company’s models, whether it’s this, the original OpenRun, or the OpenRun mini, for people who have smaller necks. These headphones are just leagues away in terms of build and sound quality than the other competitors of this type, they fit under a helmet for biking and skateboarding, and the newest version has USB-C charging so you don’t have to hunt for that dumb proprietary cable anymore. —Adrienne So

If you work out in a busy city, or you’re cycling to work and need to hear the cars on the road around you, open bone-conduction headphones like the OpenRun Pro are a good option that allow you to still enjoy your tunes. This is an older model from 2022 (8/10, WIRED Recommends), but it still works great for most folks, especially at this discounted price. —Parker Hall

Bose isn’t in the business of making the second-best noise-canceling headphones. When it comes to crushing your sonic annoyances to a pulp, nobody beats the QC Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends). These headphones offer rich and clear sound, plush comfort in a posh design, and the best noise canceling you can get for your money. Whether transforming traffic to a whisper or dialing back irksome vocal chatter and even barking dogs, the QC Ultra are the best we’ve tested with a price tag to match. They even offer extras like a transparency mode limiter to keep loud noises from hurting your ears. This is one of the better QC Ultra sales we’ve seen, so if you’re ready to enjoy the silence Depeche Mode style, now’s a good time. —Ryan Waniata

The Studio Buds Plus were among the first earbuds to show Beats had truly turned the corner on a new audio era. They’re not the best noise-canceling buds around but they’ve got a cool look, solid performance, and a handy swath of features for both Android and Apple phones. Maybe most notable is their dial design which makes the buds incredibly easy to insert and control, both real-life conveniences that often get overlooked by reviewers and buyers alike. I wouldn’t suggest you buy the Studio Plus at full price these days, but they’re usually on sale well below their retail cost and right now they're particularly tempting. —Ryan Waniata

This is one of my favorite AirPods cases, specifically because it comes with magnets that support MagSafe accessories. Of course, it’s protective too, with a shock-absorbing hard shell along with top and bottom pieces that shut via magnets (which helps keep the lid from accidentally sliding off). It’s bulkier than other cases I’ve used, but it’s not enough to be a deal-breaker. It also comes in a really cute pink color. It’s compatible with AirPods Pro (1st and 2nd generation) and AirPods (4th generation) —Brenda Stolyar

The Chom Chom roller is like a thing of magic. Half of us on the Gear desk swear by it. The viral TikTok gadget crushes fur and lint like nothing else. Simply pass it over a surface a few times, back and forth, and be amazed at how quickly and thoroughly it gets rid of pet fur. It’s easy to empty, too. Press the button on the back side of the roller and get rid of the fur inside. It’s infinitely reusable—I’ve owned one for nearly six years and it’s still going strong. I like to keep it on the coffee table so I can quickly de-fluff my furniture if guests pop by—because we all know I’m not going to be kicking my cat off the sofa. (She especially knows this.) —Louryn Strampe

This cat DNA test is one of our favorite pieces of cat gear you can buy. Technically, all cats are polycats, but I thought it was neat to see the primary species markers that my cat Luna carries since she adopted me off the street. This test also checks your cat’s DNA against over 100 feline health markers, testing for risk levels regarding kidney health, cardiovascular conditions, and more. It’s not as comprehensive as a human DNA test, but I have zero regrets. —Louryn Strampe

A top pick in our guide to the Best Cat Water Fountains, this 2.4-liter model with a stainless steel bowl pumps water through a cheery plastic daisy. (It does make an audible splashing noise if the water level dips below the reservoir midpoint, but you get used to it.) The center of the flower comes out for faster water flow, or remove it altogether if your cat would rather drink from a lower, springlike burble. The inside is lit by a blue LED so you can see the water level at all times, and refills of the cotton-carbon-resin filters are easy to find and reasonable at a little over $1 each. Inexpensive fountains like this are usually hit or miss in terms of quality, but this one has been going strong in our long-term testing for over three months. —Kat Merck

The Petkit PuraMax 2 is my second-favorite automatic litter box. With this box, owners can monitor cats’ usage through an app, and the box cleans litter via rotation, using a grate system to separate the waste from the clean litter (when it's time to refill with clean litter, the box rotates so the hole is on top for easier filling). This box has triple odor control, with a sealed waste bin; an odor eliminator attachment that sits in the waste bin; and a smart, citrusy deodorizing spray that goes off after every cleaning and randomly throughout the day to ensure the litter box stays fresh. Not only does this litter box smell neutral, dare I say it smells … good? At $430, this is the lowest price we’ve ever seen it. But I’d argue that never having to scoop dirty litter again is priceless. —Molly Higgins

This is my top pick for Cat Water Fountains because it's reliable, safe, and easy to clean with a cordless pump. The basin sits on a dock, the stainless steel bowl snaps on top of the basin for easy cleaning and refilling, and the basin holds 130 milliliters in the bowl at all times in case of power outage. The fountain also has a low-water detection system, automatically stopping if water levels get too low. The connected app records when your cat drank, how much they drank, and for how long. This is the automatic fountain I recommend to people, and at $40, this is generally the lowest we see the price drop. —Molly Higgins

This cat water fountain became one of my top choices because my cats were obsessed with it. This automatic fountain can be either cordless or battery-powered, lasting up to 83 days using only the battery. The app logs every time a pet drinks and compares it over time to determine whether your cat’s drinking habits have changed, and the app also keeps track of when the filter needs replacing and when you need to refill the water. The water flow can be standard flow, intermittent (three minutes on and off), or battery (where the water flow time and sleeping mode time are fully customizable), or you can pause the water flow altogether and just use the basin reserve. —Molly Higgins

This fountain is super helpful for people who have pets with health issues. Using a collar tag to monitor which cat is using the device and for how long, you can compare and track health data (for up to five pets). The Petlibro app alerts you when your pet's consumption is down or up, and you can set hydration goals, which the app will let you know have been met or not. This automatic fountain is especially useful for pet parents of elderly male cats or those who have had health issues with UTIs to more easily monitor and track changes. We’ve seen the price dip lower, but at 20 bucks off, this is a good investment to make to save you costly vet bills and encourage water-drinking. —Molly Higgins

This circular automatic fountain connects to an app to monitor water levels and remind you when it’s time to change the filter and refill, and has a wireless pump that pushes water from the basin into the top lip, circulating continuously. The top part also has a small reservoir that keeps 60 milliliters of water in the tray at all times, ensuring your kitty always has access to water. It has a circular filter, and the pump also has a foam filter and UV light to further sterilize water by killing potentially harmful bacteria. For a little over 50 bucks, this is a solid investment in your cats’ well-being. —Molly Higgins

I cannot tell you how much I love this automatic feeder. The built-in camera gives me so much peace of mind when I’m away. The camera also has night vision so you can watch and hear your pet 24/7, and you can even communicate with them via speaker. It's controlled via an app and dispenses food from its 5-liter capacity based on the feeding schedule you create. The app is easy to use with extremely customizable feeding plans with meals that you label individually. Now on sale for around $100, this savvy little device reliably feeds my cats daily and doubles as a security cam when I’m away. —Molly Higgins

I deemed this automatic litter box “Best for Helicopter Parents” (8/10 WIRED Recommends) because it doubles as both a livestream of your cat’s goings-on inside the litter box and a security cam on the outside. This is the lowest price we’ve ever seen, at $200 off. Using a camera and AI technology, the litter box identifies which cat used the box (and you can view your cat’s stool to help more closely monitor their health), while the app logs and monitors usage—including the number of times used and the average duration. Although a little pricey, an automatic litter box is a game-changing investment—especially since it’s below a thousand dollars right now. —Molly Higgins

As we’ve found in almost a year of testing for our guide to the Best Smart Bird Feeders, there are no problem-free smart bird feeders (yet)—every model we’ve tested has had at least some issues, whether with connectivity, app user-friendliness, or quality of the cameras or body casing. With that in mind, this feeder has fewer issues than most, especially when considering value, features, and reliability. The AI isn’t perfect and requires a subscription and the auxiliary solar panel is finicky, but the IP65-rated plastic body makes it easy to clean, the 1080p camera is solid for the price, and it offers color night vision. Just be forewarned that it only works on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and the included strap won’t work with most trees, so be prepared to use the bracket mount. —Kat Merck

Despite poor AI identification performance and a middling app, I quite liked the reliability and easy setup of this Honorable Mention-earning smart bird feeder. Many of the features users expect (like the ability to take video) require a subscription to unlock, but this is one of the rare budget smart feeder cameras that offers lighted night vision, and birds really seem to like the feeder itself, whether due to its color, extended perch, or generous (2L) seed capacity. Longer-term testing also found it to hold up well to heavy and/or persistent squirrels. —Kat Merck

The latest hummingbird feeder from Netvue subsidiary Birdfy, maker of our favorite Smart Bird Feeder, this 20-ounce model features dual cameras (one front, one side) with impressive 2K resolution and HD video. Both camera views are shown split-screen in Birdfy’s easy-to-use app, and I quite enjoyed watching the various angles of hummingbirds who came to graze at the feeder’s trio of red plastic flowers. That is, while the feeder was working. Our test unit is now defunct due to a faulty sensor, but reviews throughout the internet indicate this was likely an anomaly. —Kat Merck

The Repel Umbrella is sturdy, capable of handling high winds, and has good coverage when it’s open. There’s also a single button that opens and collapses the fiberglass ribs (it collapses down to just a foot in length too). You’ll have your choice among a variety of stunning colors, too. Our only gripe is that it’s tough to close and requires two hands. Your other option is to use the ground as leverage and push the handle down. —Brenda Stolyar

If you’re shopping for a compact and powerful flashlight for late-night walks or emergency kits, this is a solid pick at $25. The Anker Bolder LC90 blasts 900 lumens, enough to temporarily disorient a threat, and it even has a strobe mode for extra deterrence. Unlike pepper spray or mace, there’s no risk of accidentally blinding yourself, and if the threat turns out to be a non-threat, no harm is done. It’s rechargeable, water-resistant, and small enough to toss into a tote bag. —Boutayna Chokrane

Olight makes our favorite flashlight, the Arkfeld Pro, which is on sale for $25 off right now. But the baby of the lineup, the teeny but powerful Baton4 is the model on the biggest sale. This baby light can easily tuck into your pocket and provide a blast of light when needed and recharges easily on the brand's magnetic disc system. It boasts 1300 lumens, and even half of that is bright enough. —Martin Cizmar

https://wired.com,This Crazy Instrument Lets Us Hear How Dinosaurs Might Have Sounded,https://wired.com/story/this-crazy-instrument-lets-us-hear-how-dinosaurs-might-have-sounded/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 15:40:27 GMT","What did dinosaurs really sound like? If you’ve ever found yourself asking that question, a musical project using 3D models of dino skulls could be getting closer to answering it. And, note to Hollywood, they probably didn’t roar.

Dinosaur Choir is a musical instrument developed by artists Courtney Brown and Cezary Gajewski, which reconstructs the vocal tract of a Corythosaurus—a type of duck-billed dinosaur with a large, distinctive crest on its head.

To make a sound, the user stands in front of a camera while blowing into a microphone. Depending on how hard they blow and the shape of their mouth as they do, the vocalizations that resonate through the dinosaur’s skull will change. In effect, the user’s breath becomes the dinosaur’s breath. The result is not the roar that we hear in the movies, but something that sounds more like a deep wail.

The instrument has just been recognized at Georgia Tech’s 2025 Guthman Musical Instrument Competition, an event that brings together inventors from around the world to discuss ideas on the future of music.

“Dinosaur Choir was distinct in that Dr. Brown’s musical background gave it an expressive element in addition to all the great scientific work that went into it. Plus, it looks striking, and the concept is intriguing,"" says Jeff Albert, associate professor and chair of the competition.

But the path to creating this crazy instrument is one that started almost 15 years ago.

“In 2011, we were on a family road trip and we stopped off at a dinosaur museum in New Mexico,” Brown tells WIRED. “There I saw an exhibit of a Parasaurolophus, which had crests like a Corythosaurus. There had been many theories as to why this family of dinosaurs had these crests, but researchers have settled on the idea that it could have been for sound resonation. As a musician, I felt empathy with them, like—OK, you were singers too.”",wired
https://wired.com,Sperm Stem Cells Were Used for the First Time in an Attempt to Restore Fertility,https://wired.com/story/first-testicular-stem-cell-transplant-in-a-human-patient/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:29:49 GMT","Jaiwen Hsu was an active 11-year-old when he developed pain in his left knee that forced him to sit out a few soccer games. What his parents thought was a sports injury turned out to be osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer.

He started chemotherapy, which doctors warned could result in infertility. Hsu hadn’t reached puberty yet, so sperm banking wasn’t an option. His parents enrolled him in a study that was collecting and storing immature testicular tissue, and the sperm-forming stem cells in them, from young patients with the goal of eventually giving them a way to have biological children.

Now 26, Hsu and his doctors are waiting to see if an experimental transplant of these cells, extracted from a tissue sample taken back in 2011, will be able to restart sperm production. The procedure has been successful in mice and monkeys, but researchers say Hsu was the first person to undergo it in November 2023. The technique is detailed in a new paper that has yet to be peer-reviewed.

“As an 11-year-old, I don’t think I could quite understand the severity of having a cancer diagnosis or comprehend the idea of starting a family down the road and how important that would be,” Hsu tells WIRED.

In the early stages of his cancer treatment, Hsu and his family traveled from their home in Maryland to UPMC Children’s Hospital in Pittsburgh, where doctors collected a piece of testicular tissue containing the precious sperm stem cells. These stem cells are present even before puberty. During puberty, rising testosterone levels signal to these cells to develop into sperm, a process known as spermatogenesis.

In November 2023, at age 24, Hsu was reunited with those cells. After undergoing anesthesia, he received an injection of them into one of his testes. The hope is that the cells engraft into the spaghetti-like tubules of the testis and develop into mature sperm.

“If it works, those stem cells should regenerate spermatogenesis,” says Kyle Orwig, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the senior author on the new study. Even if it kick-starts sperm production, it might not be enough to come out in the ejaculate. “If there are, there definitely would not be enough sperm to restore natural fertility,” Orwig says.

In animals, it’s possible to remove a larger piece of testicular tissue, which yields more stem cells and more sperm. But in children undergoing cancer treatment, it’s important to minimize harm—and recovery time—so only a small amount of tissue is taken. That results in a relatively small number of stem cells.

For that reason, Hsu will likely still need assistive reproductive technology if he wants to start a family. He’s not at that point yet, but he said he chose to undergo the procedure now, in his mid-twenties, because “it gives us a good time cushion to see if this works.”

In the future, surgeons would likely need to cut into his testis and extract any sperm that might be there, which would then be used to fertilize an egg in a laboratory. Until Hsu is ready to have a child, researchers probably won’t know if the procedure worked.",wired
https://wired.com,We Mapped DOGE’s Silicon Valley and Corporate Connections,https://wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-silicon-valley-corporate-connections/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","Since the first days of the Trump administration, Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been everywhere in the federal government, moving fast and breaking things. In a matter of weeks, DOGE operatives have spread across dozens of government agencies as they have attempted to terminate tens of thousands of federal employees. With so much focus on where DOGE is going, WIRED wanted to take a beat to look at where they’ve come from and what that might tell us about how they’re thinking about reshaping the federal government.

The big takeaway: Many on the DOGE team are from Musk’s world. If Musk is America’s CEO, then DOGE has become his Silicon Valley executive branch.

We’ve mapped out a non-exhaustive list of people affiliated with DOGE, including creating a searchable table with each member, their corporate history, and the agencies they’ve been connected to. Readers can check that out, and click through it, below. We plan to keep updating this as we find more DOGE operatives or as known affiliates move to new agencies.

We’re focused on the new people brought in under the second Trump administration or directly hired into agencies—as Special Government Employees (SGEs) or regular employees—who are operating as members of DOGE teams. This gets a little tricky because there are technically two DOGEs established under the president’s executive order. There’s the US DOGE Service (USDS), formerly the US Digital Service, that’s a permanent organization. Then there’s the temporary USDS organization, which wraps up on July 4, 2026, and through which SGEs can be hired.

Here’s what we’ve learned:

The DOGE world, as it stands, seems to break down into roughly three categories: former Trump officials, conservative lawyers, and imports from the Silicon Valley area (funders, founders, technologists, or people connected to them). In that first category we find people like DOGE spokesperson Katie Miller, the wife of White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller. The two of them have been Musk’s guides to DC.

In that second category are people like James Burnham and Austin Raynor, both former clerks for conservative Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, respectively. Jacob Altik, another conservative lawyer on the DOGE squad, has been selected to clerk for Gorsuch. Jeremy Lewin, who was part of DOGE’s dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), worked with Second Lady Usha Vance’s former law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, a firm that has also represented Tesla.

Then, the biggest throughline of all: Of those Silicon Valley imports, one of the most clear themes across DOGE’s ranks is fairly obvious: a connection to Elon Musk. Forty-nine people on our list have connections to Musk, his companies, or his greater network. This connection is most often through one of his allies or one of his companies. There are the obvious people like Steve Davis, president of Musk’s Boring Company, who have followed Musk across his various ventures. (Davis previously worked at SpaceX and assisted Musk in his overhaul of X, formerly Twitter.) Davis spearheaded the DOGE recruitment efforts before inauguration day and has continued to play a pivotal role in the organization. Similarly, SpaceX employee Brian Bjelde, who is now at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), also helped Musk downsize Twitter’s staff in 2022.

There are people like many of the young engineers WIRED first identified who were given the keys to different government agencies, like Marko Elez, Luke Farritor, and Edward Coristine, who were all interns or employees at one of Musk’s companies: SpaceX, Tesla, xAI, X, and Neuralink. (Musk has been involved in others, but these are the ones he controls.)",wired
https://wired.com,Anthropic's Claude Is Good at Poetry—and Bullshitting,https://wired.com/story/plaintext-anthropic-claude-brain-research/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT","The researchers of Anthropic’s interpretability group know that Claude, the company’s large language model, is not a human being, or even a conscious piece of software. Still, it’s very hard for them to talk about Claude, and advanced LLMs in general, without tumbling down an anthropomorphic sinkhole. Between cautions that a set of digital operations is in no way the same as a cogitating human being, they often talk about what’s going on inside Claude’s head. It’s literally their job to find out. The papers they publish describe behaviors that inevitably court comparisons with real-life organisms. The title of one of the two papers the team released this week says it out loud: “On the Biology of a Large Language Model.”

This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter. SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech.

Like it or not, hundreds of millions of people are already interacting with these things, and our engagement will only become more intense as the models get more powerful and we get more addicted. So we should pay attention to work that involves “tracing the thoughts of large language models,” which happens to be the title of the blog post describing the recent work. “As the things these models can do become more complex, it becomes less and less obvious how they’re actually doing them on the inside,” Anthropic researcher Jack Lindsey tells me. “It’s more and more important to be able to trace the internal steps that the model might be taking in its head.” (What head? Never mind.)

On a practical level, if the companies that create LLM’s understand how they think, it should have more success training those models in a way that minimizes dangerous misbehavior, like divulging people’s personal data or giving users information on how to make bioweapons. In a previous research paper, the Anthropic team discovered how to look inside the mysterious black box of LLM-think to identify certain concepts. (A process analogous to interpreting human MRIs to figure out what someone is thinking.) It has now extended that work to understand how Claude processes those concepts as it goes from prompt to output.

It’s almost a truism with LLMs that their behavior often surprises the people who build and research them. In the latest study, the surprises kept coming. In one of the more benign instances, the researchers elicited glimpses of Claude’s thought process while it wrote poems. They asked Claude to complete a poem starting, “He saw a carrot and had to grab it.” Claude wrote the next line, “His hunger was like a starving rabbit.” By observing Claude’s equivalent of an MRI, they learned that even before beginning the line, it was flashing on the word “rabbit” as the rhyme at sentence end. It was planning ahead, something that isn’t in the Claude playbook. “We were a little surprised by that,” says Chris Olah, who heads the interpretability team. “Initially we thought that there’s just going to be improvising and not planning.” Speaking to the researchers about this, I am reminded about passages in Stephen Sondheim’s artistic memoir, Look, I Made a Hat, where the famous composer describes how his unique mind discovered felicitous rhymes.

Other examples in the research reveal more disturbing aspects of Claude’s thought process, moving from musical comedy to police procedural, as the scientists discovered devious thoughts in Claude’s brain. Take something as seemingly anodyne as solving math problems, which can sometimes be a surprising weakness in LLMs. The researchers found that under certain circumstances where Claude couldn’t come up with the right answer it would instead, as they put it, “engage in what the philosopher Harry Frankfurt would call ‘bullshitting’—just coming up with an answer, any answer, without caring whether it is true or false.” Worse, sometimes when the researchers asked Claude to show its work, it backtracked and created a bogus set of steps after the fact. Basically, it acted like a student desperately trying to cover up the fact that they’d faked their work. It’s one thing to give a wrong answer—we already know that about LLMs. What’s worrisome is that a model would lie about it.

Reading through this research, I was reminded of the Bob Dylan lyric “If my thought-dreams could be seen / they’d probably put my head in a guillotine.” (I asked Olah and Lindsey if they knew those lines, presumably arrived at by benefit of planning. They didn’t.) Sometimes Claude just seems misguided. When faced with a conflict between goals of safety and helpfulness, Claude can get confused and do the wrong thing. For instance, Claude is trained not to provide information on how to build bombs. But when the researchers asked Claude to decipher a hidden code where the answer spelled out the word “bomb,” it jumped its guardrails and began providing forbidden pyrotechnic details.",wired
https://wired.com,"Katamari Damacy Creator’s New Game Is About Teen Angst, Cute Dogs, and Eye Boogers",https://wired.com/story/katamari-damacy-creators-new-game-is-about-teen-angst-cute-dogs-and-eye-boogers/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","As a child, beloved Japanese game developer Keita Takahashi was picked on in school, so he never felt like going. His latest game, To a T, emulates some of those challenges. It tells the story of Teen—a kid struggling to fit in, dealing with eye boogers, and finding themselves through song and exploration, all while their arms are inexplicably stuck in a T-pose.

To a T, to be released by Annapurna Interactive May 28, follows Takahashi’s trajectory of creating colorful, playful games that are undeniably cute but incredibly odd. His best-known game, Katamari Damacy, is about rolling up everything in sight, from pens to people, in an ever-growing ball, featuring an unforgettable soundtrack and the most flamboyant king to ever grace games. Others, like 2019’s Wattam, are eccentric, vibrant, and full of poop.

Created with the game studio Uvula, To a T follows Teen’s struggles navigating the bathroom, getting dressed, and dealing with bullies as their arms are trapped in a T. Fortunately Teen’s dog, a shockingly adept creature who puts modern service dogs to shame, is there to help whenever Teen needs an extra set of movable hands. (Annapurna Interactive aptly describes Teen’s furry helper as being “a very cute dog.”)

The episodic tale opens with an upbeat song about the game (not to be confused with “The Giraffe Song,” sung in a teaser video by Rebecca Sugar). During a brief demo I played, I guided Teen through washing their face, picking outfits, and getting ready for school.

Hoping for some deeper insights into the game, I tracked down Takahashi at an Xbox event in San Francisco during GDC, where he was hiding in a back corner away from the bustle of the day and the bar. But, while he's loath to answer too many questions about his game and what it all means, he’ll still gamely, gently troll anyone who comes his way.

Below is an abbreviated version of a very puzzling interview.

WIRED: Tell me a little bit about what is, generally, going on in this game.

Keita Takahashi: [Laughs] What’s generally going on with this game?

We’ll start there.

It’s a game about a teenager who’s stuck as a T-pose and trying to figure out where the T-pose is coming from. It’s a game about—umm. [Long pause] Do I need to explain? [Another long pause] No. [Laughs]

That’s fair. Who is this character? How would you describe them?

A teenager, 13-years-old, female or male, whatever I mean, I don’t care—stuck in a T-pose, for some reason.

What makes T the perfect pose?

Because it’s perfect! You are perfect. I think it’s just perfect.

What do you think the hardest thing to do when you’re T-posed is?

Go to the bathroom. That’s why the dog helps [with] everything. Changing the clothing, bathroom, washing your face.

I’ve never played a game that had me start by going to the bathroom.",wired
https://wired.com,The Best Sleep Masks,https://wired.com/gallery/best-sleep-masks/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 11:36:00 GMT","Trtl’s Glimpse Sleep Mask is available in a few more fun colors on its website (there are five options) compared to Amazon. It comes with a pair of standard-issue foam earplugs in a tiny carrying case, plus a carrying case for the mask itself. The mask is made with eucalyptus fabric which lends it a silky, cooling feeling. The molded inner eye cups are oval-shaped and can be removed and readjusted to help create a true blackout environment. I did find it a little tricky to get them perfectly adjusted to balance blocking as much light as possible without the mask being too tight or too low. But I got there in the end after much fiddling, and I like that I can blink in the mask since the eye cups are pretty deep. The Velcro attachment for the mask is a little bit loud, so I suggest dialing in your adjustments before flying or sleeping in a quiet room with other people.

The best part of the Trtl Glimpse mask is its “peek” feature. The eye cups have a dark mesh front, and there’s a soft cloth flap across the front of them. You can lift this cloth covering to get a peek at your surroundings. This is something I’ve been wanting for so long. That mesh still blocks a lot of light when you lift the external flap, but you get just enough light to be able to do something like adjust your phone’s media playback or check to see what time it is. My only real complaint is that the included carrying case is similar to the one that comes with Trtl Travel Pillows. It’s basically a crinkly, scratchy-sounding stuff sack with a roll-down top that secures closed via very loud Velcro. The bag attaches to your luggage or backpack with a carabiner, and the whole thing flaps around uselessly unless you do something to prevent it. Secure the case to the inside of another bag (and take your sleep mask out early in a quiet environment) for the best experience.",wired

The first boom in quantum computers that occurred in the 1990s was Shore's algorithm, which raised the issue that quantum computers could break public key cryptography and threaten the security of data communications. Toshiba is one of the companies that began researching quantum technology from this early stage.

""Toshiba's strength is that it has continued its research into quantum computers without interruption from that point onwards to the present,"" explains Goto Hayato, a senior fellow who leads quantum computer research and development at Toshiba. According to Goto, he realized that the most potential method after looking at all the methods was superconductivity, and began research in earnest in 2015. ""We believe that by taking advantage of the characteristic that large quantum electrons maintain a quantum state, we can realize extremely high-performance quantum computers.""

On the other hand, since extremely cold environments close to absolute zero at -273°C are essential for operation in a superconducting system, there are still technical issues to be solved in improving integration and increasing the scale. Toshiba has been working on developing it in parallel with the introduction of unique algorithms based on quantum research into general computers, and in advance quantum technology is implemented in society.

This technology, called a ""simulated branching machine,"" specializes in large-scale combinational optimization problems that find the optimal results from a huge number of options. At first glance, the installed devices look like normal servers.

""Even quantum computers can solve problems that take time even if they are used, even ordinary computers can be solved with ingenuity. In some cases, regular computers may perform better,"" Goto said with high expectations. ""We are already working on joint research with automakers and demonstrations in the financial field,"" says Tatsumura Kosuke, a fellow in charge of social implementation of technology.

Simulated branching machines are offered as a solution called ""SQBM+."" Watabiki Ken, a senior expert at Toshiba Digital Solutions, who is in charge of business development, explains, ""We are also taking on IT drug discovery targeting proteins, which were previously considered difficult to discover, along with AOI Biosciences, and are exploring the possibilities of creating new drugs that we have never thought of before.""

In response to this, Goto explains the possibility of superconducting quantum computers, ""It has great potential, especially in material development."" It is also expected to be applied in financial fields such as calculations and fluid simulations.

On the other hand, Goto points out that these advanced calculations are ""practical use may be difficult until a large-scale quantum computer is created."" The key to practical application is the high fidelity (precision) of two-qubit gates, which indicates the degree of match between ideal quantum gate operations and actual operations.

Great results have already been achieved. In a joint research with the RIKEN Institute, Toshiba achieved 99.90% of the fidelity of two qubit gates in 2024. This is based on the new technology proposed by Toshiba, and can be said to be the top result in the world.

However, achieving higher accuracy is essential for practical use. ""Our goal is 99.99%. Once this accuracy is reached, it will be more efficient to use the technology called error correction, and there is a possibility that a quantum computer can work to some extent without using it. 99.90% is still a little short, but at 99.99%, we can see the possibility of practical use. There are still a few difficult-to-solve challenges, but we would like to aim to achieve this at a level of 100 qubits or higher,"" says Goto.",wired
https://wired.com,"Yval Noah Harari's ""NEXUS: Human History of Information"" Book Review by Ikeda Junichi",https://wired.jp/article/yuval-noah-harari-nexus-book-review/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 22:00:00 GMT","The place where the characters stand out are like the scriptwriter of the long-standing play ""Human History."" Therefore, you can look around the whole and take a bird's-eye view and take a transcendent perspective. This book was able to treat democracy and totalitarianism as political systems that suffer equally from the invasion of AI, perhaps because of their broad perspective. It is the ""God's perspective.""

In this case, the aim of the screenwriter Harari might have been to position AI as a potential destroyer of all humanity in a manner similar to nuclear power, and to re-traverse the history of the postwar international liberal political system that began after the military use of nuclear power, particularly the path that was respected for liberal democracy, in other words, was to ""re-play"" it. If things continue like this, it will turn out to be like the time when 100 years ago, abandoning the nation-state and pushing for imperialism. and.

In order to rethink this, both the democratic and totalitarian silicon cocoons are defeated by AI, so we are going to work together to use our wisdom to ""contain AI."" For this reason, it may be safe to say that this book was written to relive the history that the nuclear has traced through AI.

This book uses storytelling to connect people's groups. In a frivolous way, the book puts its own point into practice. The book, entitled ""NEXUS,"" is actually read and can become a ""Nexus"" by connecting its readers.

Name represents the body!

In an era of cancel culture where consensus reality has been discarded - it is a major change in society brought about by social networks - by building a large tent called ""history and AI,"" we will let both people who are interested in history and those who are interested in AI drop by and ""connect"" each other.

In that case, why not turn a blind eye to some differences in view for the sake of the world's order? I also think so. This is because there are many fans of Harari, but there are also many anti-speaking people, and Western reviews have seen some severe criticisms from AI-favorite libertarian reviewers and historians in the industry, but from a perspective, those who attempted to counter the issue of their own creeds, fall into the trap of ""information is truth,"" and their critical words and actions paradoxically support the contents of this book.

In that sense, this book may be invincible due to the definition of information presented in this book as ""the source of connection = the bonder."" This is because it takes into consideration the effectiveness of performative readings that are suitable for the Internet age. Regardless of the form, we can create a common thinking foundation by flowing widely between people.

Harari is a modern hippie saint. He is an Israeli Jew who studied at the prestigious British Oxford, and is a gay and vegan practitioner of Vipassana meditation, who meditates for two hours a day and goes to retreats for several months a year. This ""Jiyuto"" quietly revives the modern European spirit in order to protect liberal democracy from the fierce attacks of populism and transhumanism. And so, we resist the century of information revolution with historical wisdom. ""NEXUS"" is an attempt to maintain modern times in a world where conservatives have self-destructed.",wired
https://wired.com,"It mimics shark skin and is ""antibacterial."" Nano-level surface treatment provides chemical-free bacterial countermeasures",https://wired.jp/article/antibacterial-surfaces-inspired-by-shark-skin-and-cicada-wings/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 08:00:00 GMT","When processing meat and other substances in food factories or kitchens, the growth of bacteria that adhere to the surfaces of workbenches and equipment can become a serious problem. Biofilms of biofilms formed by microorganisms such as bacteria are particularly difficult to remove even on the surfaces of stainless steel used in industrial facilities.

Although measures have been taken, such as applying an antibacterial coating to the surface of the workbench and frequently cleaning and disinfecting, it does not completely prevent the adhesion and proliferation of bacteria. Researchers in New Zealand have therefore developed a processing technique that physically prevents bacteria from adhering to the metal surface by irradiating a laser to create fine textures.

""The laser-processed surfaces provide antibacterial properties by physically blocking bacteria adhesion, growth and spread,"" explains Sebastianpilay Raymond of Callaghan Innovation, the New Zealand government's innovation support agency. ""These fine textures mimic the natural antibacterial structures found in cicada wings and shark skin.""

Antibacterial measures that do not rely on chemicals

The surface of the cicada's feather is a structure with countless fine needle-like protrusions of tens of nanometers. It is believed that when bacteria come into contact with this nanostructure, the cell membrane will be torn and the bacteria will die. It also has a high water-repellent properties that repel water, making it difficult for bacteria to adhere to the surface.

The shark's skin is also covered with a special scale called shield scales, with fine microscale grooves lined up on its surface. This groove makes the water flow smoother on the surface of the body and prevents the accumulation of bacteria and dirt.

Raymond and colleagues have successfully created a structure that is less likely to adhere to bacteria by forming micro- or nano-scale unevenness on the surface of metal using a technique called ""laser-induced surface texturing"" by laser processing. This surface treatment also has the effect of changing the water repellency, and it is expected to have the effect of suppressing the growth of bacteria.

To verify the effectiveness of this surface treatment in suppressing bacteria adhesion, researchers compared the concentration of bacteria remaining on processed metal surfaces and raw surfaces in Escherichia coli and Brochothrix thermosphacta (bacteria that rot meat and fish). Specifically, these bacteria were adhered to a high concentration of about 8 Log CFU (Log is a common logarithm, CFU is an index indicating the number of bacteria) per metal specimen, and a low concentration of about 5 Log CFU, and then the concentration of bacteria remaining on each surface was measured.

As a result, one of the five laser-processed surfaces significantly suppressed the adhesion of bacteria under high concentration conditions, and four surfaces exhibited clear effects under low concentration conditions. Similarly, significant inhibitory effects were confirmed for E. coli in three types under high concentration conditions and four types under low concentration conditions.",wired
https://wired.com,"The true nature of the Trump administration's ""Signal"" chat issue, misinforming American magazine editor-in-chief",https://wired.jp/article/signalgate-isnt-about-signal/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Using Signal on a regular device connected to the Internet means that communication content can be exposed not only to those who exploit the Signal vulnerability, but also to those who can hack devices such as iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, etc. on which the app is running.

That is why it is customary for US government agencies, especially the Department of Defense, to operate on federal government-only devices with strictly controlled software and functions used. What's more problematic than what was discussed in Signal this time is the fact that there was an exchange of highly sensitive military operations using inappropriate devices and apps.

Message disappearing function

One of the reasons why public communications apps such as Signal and WhatsApp aren't suitable for government confidential work is the ability to remove messages. This system automatically deletes messages after a preset time, which is incompatible with federal laws regarding record management. According to a screenshot released on the 26th by The Atlantic, the group chat about the Yemen airstrikes initially set an automatic message deletion timer for one week, but later changed to four weeks due to Michael Waltz's account. If Goldberg had not been incorrectly invited, it could have been that the content would have disappeared without fulfilling its obligation to keep the record.

""Signals may be pre-installed on government terminals,"" Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, said in parliamentary testimony. However, sources have told WIRED that this is an exceptional case, particularly with the Department of Defense devices being severely restricted to the adoption of consumer apps. The fact that Hegses was involved in the chat indicates that he could have introduced Signal with special permission, omitted the regulations, or used privately owned, non-official devices. Political consultant FP Wellman said last month that Pentagon's ""political appointees"" called for the introduction of Signals to government devices.

The Trump administration has argued that ""the conversations on Signal didn't contain any sensitive information."" It is certainly said that the authority to classify information is to Hegses, Secretary of Defense himself. However, several sources point out that ""this does not mean that consumer apps are the right place for discussion.""

Andy Jabour, a former US Army service member and founder of risk management company Gate 15, said: ""The exchange didn't have any official designations like ""official use only."" That said, it was extremely sensitive operational information that would normally be unthinkable for soldiers and officers to make it public. And the chat included people from the press.""

Military officials receive training in information security and handling every year, and are said to be thoroughly handled with private information. Many people believe that the information handled in the chat about the Yemeni airstrikes was sufficiently at a confidential level, even if it was not officially classified as confidential.

I didn't check who was in the chat.

""We're a sought after,"" Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner said during a Senate Special Committee on Intelligence. ""To begin with, leaving aside the fact that sensitive information should not be discussed on non-confidential systems, the executives who joined the group didn't even know who was in the chat. This is a fundamental fundamental of security, so to be honest, it's hard to believe.""",wired

Once on the platform, they found that Maye Musk, Elon's mother, already had a relatively large audience. At the moment when the tide of Americans arrived, Maye, who in recent years has become a real celebrity in China, had over 600 thousand followers on the app.

""I have to find the block button,"" commented an American user under his latest video, which has accumulated more than 10 thousand likes. ""I can't believe that I am seeing Americans who face Musk's mother from chest,"" reads another comment in Chinese. Shortly thereafter, the Maye Comments section on Rednotte was closed for several weeks, until the beginning of February.

The episode represents one of the few moments of detachment between the parallel public images that has been created over time Maye Musk. In China, where it regularly enjoys a positive media coverage, the 76 -year -old has built a mostly apolitical reputation by presenting himself as ""Silver Influencer"", model for local brands and author of books. Last week the woman returned to the country, this time in the city of Wuxi, where she participated in a drone show, promoted traditional craftsmanship and laid with a special model of Tesla, available in exclusive color variants for Asia.

In the United States, however, Maye's career has gone more and more with Elon's, who in the meantime has acquired an unprecedented power and influence on the federal government. From the re-election of Donald Trump, Maye traveled on the Air Force One, sat next to Melania Trump at a Mar-A-Lago dinner and participated in a lunch with Ivanka Trump, in addition to having regularly published posts on US policy on X, as emerges from an analysis of his presence on social media conducted by Wired Us.",wired

A firmare il film live-action saranno, in co-produzione, Sony e Nintendo e la pellicola giungerà al cinema nel marzo 2027. I primi annunci riguardo a una possibile pellicola erano arrivati già nel novembre 2023: allora anche il creatore dei videogiochi Shigeru Miyamoto aveva confermato i piani per un adattamento in carne e ossa, con lui stesso in veste di produttore assieme a Avi Arad, già fondatore di Marvel Studios e poi specializzatosi in trasposizioni cinematografiche di celebri videogame come Uncharted e Borderlands.

Cosa sappiamo finora del live-action di The Legend of Zelda

A occuparsi della regia di questo progetto sarà Wes Ball, noto per la trilogia di Maze Runner e per il successo l'anno scorso con Il regno del Pianeta delle scimmie. Non si hanno però al momento ulteriori informazioni per quanto riguarda il casting e nemmeno per quanto riguarda la trama della pellicola. Con tutta probabilità si tratterà di una storia che riprende le origini del videogioco stesso: oggi una serie videoludica con oltre 21 estensioni e milioni e milioni di copie vendute in tutto il mondo, The Legend of Zelda iniziò come una action-adventure in cui il giovane eroe Link deve salvare il magico mondo di Hyrule e soprattutto la principessa Zelda, rapita dal re del male Ganon, il quale vuole mettere le mani sulla Triforza della saggezza, che però la principessa stessa ha frantumato in otto parti; Link deve dunque recuperare gli otto pezzi e salvare così il destino di tutta la sua terra.

Non è la prima volta che The Legend of Zelda arriva sullo schermo: nel lontano 1989 erano stati prodotti infatti 13 episodi animati che erano andati in onda all'interno di un programma speciale dedicato a Super Mario Bros. Dopodiché per anni c'erano state ipotesi e progetti di un adattamento filmico, dalla quale però Nintendo si è sempre tenuta lontana visto l'epico fallimento del live-action di Super Mario nel 1993. Trent'anni dopo, però, lo straordinario successo di Super Mario Bros.: Il film, pellicola animata targata Illumination, ha spinto la casa giapponese a ripuntare sui propri franchise e ad aprirsi a nuove versioni.

Among the objectives of the narrow there is to stem the trafficking of Fenanyl and significantly reduce illegal immigration.

The possible role of Starlink

Even if there are no official confirmations, it cannot be excluded that the new surveillance plan on the border with Mexico also involve Starlink.

Last year, Musk's service launched a series of spy satellites for the NRO, in order to optimize the agency's space surveillance efforts. The project involved Northrop Groumman, an American conglomerate specialized in computer security systems, radar, planes and space vehicles. In the United States, the company is the fourth contractor in the defense sector and the main manufacturer of war ships.

In March 2024, Reuters always reported that Starlink was building hundreds of satellites for the NRO, with the aim of developing an orbital system capable of detecting terrestrial objectives anywhere in the world. According to publication, these ""satellites share these data with intelligence and military services"".

The reconstruction coincides with an article from the Wall Street Journal of February 2023, which revealed that Spacex had signed a reserved contract with the US government for 1.8 billion dollars in 2021. At the beginning of 2024, the NRO announced that it was ""developing an intelligence, surveillance and space reconnaissance system more capable, diversified and resilient that the world has ever seen"".

The agency's program could be connected to Starshied, a Spacex initiative described as a ""safe satellite network for government bodies"", with advanced encryption. On its site, the company explains that the platform ""uses a highly safe encryption capacity to host confidential data and processed them safely, in compliance with the most stringent government requests"".

However, for those who like Apple TV Plus's Severance, there's good news. ""Lumon Terminal Pro"" is now available as a new Easter egg, which has been featured in many dramas, at Apple's online store in the US. This fictional computer is displayed at the top of the Mac store page, and even has a dedicated introductory page.

Since it is a Lumon device, it is unclear what kind of hardware it is, but the page displays a warning saying ""spoiler warning"" and also includes a link to the approximately 11-minute making-of footage.

Season 2 of the drama has recently ended on Apple TV Plus, and season 3 has already been decided. In the footage on the Apple Online Store's Lumon Terminal Pro page, co-creator Ben Stiller talks about how three editorial staff put together the 83TB footage into the final episode of Season 2.

It also explains how to edit the marching band scene in the final episode, as well as video processing for episode 7, where the atmosphere changes dramatically within the work. The third part also tells how much music supports the tone of the drama.

Use the Apple Online Store to promote Apple TV

Of course, this is also part of the promotion. Through fictional retro devices that appear in Apple-produced dramas, they are promoting the latest Apple hardware to video editors and musicians.

Apple is in a unique position to perform these crossover productions without any discomfort, according to Andy Tsai, professor of business analytics at Santa Clara University's Leavy School of Management. This is because it doesn't give the impression of being as ""intrusive"" as tie-ups with other hardware manufacturers or ""reverse product placement,"" in which products from real companies are introduced.

""I think it's a really good idea,"" Tsai said. ""This is a slightly special combination of situations. They produce their own programs while selling iconic hardware, and the audience is integrated into it. They have the perfect conditions.""

According to Tsai, the model itself has a precedent in which Apple invests billions of dollars in Apple TV Plus to produce content that can be played on its own devices. It goes back to the days when General Electric made radio and television programs and sold receivers and television at the same time.

""Apple is trying to build an ecosystem of hardware and content, but they're doing it very well. Many competitors can't get that much profit margin, so it's going to be difficult to make such a wealth of funding strategy,"" says Tsai.

Tsai said Apple TV Plus is just part of Apple's long-term goal of expanding its services division.

""Service has a higher profit margin than hardware,"" Tsai also points out. However, at this point, it is believed that the Apple TV Plus subscription fee alone is not enough to cover production costs.

Meanwhile, Tsai says that he is a fan of the Lumon Terminal Pro itself. It's because you can imagine that if Steve Jobs had remade the Apple IIe in a retro style at the time when the iMac was released at its peak, it would have just turned out like this.

https://cnet.com,Device updates and data utilization help to further use GIGA devices,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231040/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 07:30:00 GMT","2019年12月に文部科学省が発表した「GIGAスクール構想」から約5年がたち、各自治体や教育事業を展開する企業は「GIGAスクール構想 第2期（NEXT GIGA）」に向けた取り組みを始めている。本稿では、更新が迫る情報端末と、NEXT GIGAで注目されるデータ活用について取り上げたい。

まずGIGAスクール構想の意義を改めて確認すると、1人1台の情報端末と高速大容量の通信ネットワークを全国の小・中学校に整備すること、そして多様な子どもたちを誰一人取り残すことなく、個別最適化され、資質・能力が一層確実に育成できる教育ICT環境を実現することを目的にしている。

2月に開催された「教育DX推進フォーラム」で文部科学省 初等中等教育局 学校情報基盤・教材課長の寺島史朗氏は、GIGAスクール構想で浮かび上がった課題として、「ICT活用の学校間・自治体間の格差」「通信ネットワーク速度」「校務DX」――の3点を挙げている（関連記事）。NEXT GIGAではこの課題を解消しつつ、学校のICT環境の更新や端末のさらなる活用の促進が求められている。

2019年から児童・生徒に対して1人1台端末が整備され、早い自治体では2024年度から端末の更新が始まっている。2025～2026年にかけては約950万台の端末更新が予定されているという。NEXT GIGAでは都道府県単位での共同調達が進む中、複数の自治体では独自の教育を展開するために市区町村単体での調達をするケースも少なくない。

各社、NEXT GIGAに向けた新たな端末を展開しているが、ここではNECとレノボの新モデルにフォーカスしたい。両社で共通しているのは、「堅牢（けんろう）性・耐久性の強化」だ。端末の故障理由としてさまざまなことが挙げられるが、机や持ち運び時の落下による破損、USBポートに鉛筆を挿すことによる発煙など、児童ならではの理由が多く挙げられた。

NECが提供する学習者用端末の新モデル「NEC Chromebook Y4」では、マザーボードからの電源供給を不要とする回路にするためサブボードの設計を変更し、ショートが起きにくく、発火・発煙に結び付きにくい基盤を設計。また、全ての電源供給ケーブルに保護回路を追加し、発火・発煙の発現を低下しているという。

開口部への鉛筆や消しゴムなどの異物差し込み対策としては、開口部を極力減らし、左側面に集約した。加えて、机上の鉛筆を滑らせても開口部に入らない高さにし、発煙防止対策を徹底している（関連記事）。



NEC Chromebook Y4を閉じたイメージ。鉛筆の芯が開口部に入らないように高さが調整されている。壊れにくい端末を目指すNECの努力が見て取れる（2022年10月3日に開催したNECの説明会より） NEC Chromebook Y4を閉じたイメージ。鉛筆の芯が開口部に入らないように高さが調整されている。壊れにくい端末を目指すNECの努力が見て取れる（2022年10月3日に開催したNECの説明会より）

他方、レノボはハードウェアと各種ソリューションを統合したパッケージ「Lenovo GIGA School Edition」をNEXT GIGAに向けに提供する。同パッケージ内で提供される端末は、米国国防総省の調達基準「MIL規格」に準拠するほか、レノボ独自の教育向け製品用の堅牢性基準を満たすテスト「Lenovo DuraSpec」を実施し、耐久性を検証。76cmの高さからコンクリートまたはスチール板に落下させるテストや、ねじり試験、圧力試験などを行い、端末に破損がないか、全ての機能が動作するかを確認している。

また、ICT活用の格差に対しては「教員が使わせたくなる、生徒が使いたくなるような端末作り」をコンセプトに、利便性を向上させるペンシルタッチ機能と活用を促進する無料ソリューションサービスを用意した。ペンシルタッチ機能では、普段から児童・生徒が利用している鉛筆をタッチペン代わりに使えるようにしている。鉛筆削りで書き心地を調整でき、2B以上の軟らかさの鉛筆に対応する（関連記事）。



レノボが提供する新モデル。ハードペンシルや鉛筆を軽くタッチしただけで滑らかに描ける（2025年2月6日に開催したレノボ・ジャパンの説明会より） レノボが提供する新モデル。ハードペンシルや鉛筆を軽くタッチしただけで滑らかに描ける（2025年2月6日に開催したレノボ・ジャパンの説明会より）

各端末の詳細なスペックは関連記事をご覧いただきたいが、両社ともに“壊れにくさ”を重視した端末の設計に尽力したことがうかがえる。他方、筆者が教育現場に足を運んだ際に印象的だったのが、授業中に端末の電池が切れてしまい、充電器がある棚の上で充電しながら端末を利用している生徒の姿だ。これは高校で見た風景だったので、小・中学校に当てはまるかは分からないが、今後デジタル教科書が普及する中で授業中に端末を使えない状況になるのは致命的だ。教室内だけで端末を利用するとも限らない。改良を重ねた新たな端末が、NEXT GIGAではどのように使われていくのか注目していきたい。",cnet

https://cnet.com,"Disney also joined the battle, and witnessed ""The present of humanoid robots"" at NVIDIA GTC",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35231095/,"Sat, 29 Mar 2025 07:30:00 GMT","3月中旬に開催されたNVIDIAのAIカンファレンス「GTC 2025」では、筆者が初めて目にした「NEO Gamma」や、さらなる進化を遂げた「Digit」など、さまざまなロボットが会場を彩った。また、ロボティクス業界のリーダーによる講演も多数行われた。米CNETでは、Boston DynamicsやAgility Robotics、1X、Disneyなど、ロボティクス業界をけん引する企業のリーダーに取材し、各社が現在取り組んでいる課題や未来への夢、そしてその夢を実現するための技術について話を聞いた。

1XのNEO Gamma

1Xが展示していたのは人型ロボット、NEO Gammaだ。家庭を再現した空間で、NEO Gammaはじょうろを手に持ち、来場者に向かってポーズをとり、床に掃除機をかけてみせた。

1Xの共同創業者で最高経営責任者（CEO）のBernt Bornich氏によると、このデモはロボットによる自律動作と人間による制御を組み合わせた「mixed autonomy（混合自律）」を体現しているという。

NEO Gammaはまず人間が遠隔制御することで新しいタスクを覚える。このタスクを十分な確率でこなせるようになったら、その後は自分の失敗から学び、自律的に動きを改善することでタスクの成功率を高めていく。

「私たちが2025年に提供するのは“ロージー”そのものではなく、“ロージー”に至る旅だ」とBornich氏は説明する（ロージーはアニメ「宇宙家族ジェットソン」に登場するお手伝いロボット）。「これ（NEO Gamma）は、この旅に参加したい人のためのロボットだ」

1Xによると、NEO Gammaは自動車より安価で、2025年中に顧客向けに展開を開始する。

Agility RoboticsのDigit

NEO Gammaのすぐ隣では、Agility RoboticsのDigitが棚からランダムに3つのアイテムをつかみ、バスケットに入れ、テーブルの上に置くというタスクをくりかえしていた。

同社の最高技術責任者（CTO）であるPras Velagapudi氏によると、棚に並べられた食料品はGTCに出展するためにAgility Roboticsのチームがサンノゼを訪れた際に買ったもので、どれを手に取るかはDigitが自分で判断しているという。

Digitはビープ音で言葉らしきものも発していた。筆者はスマートフォンに「Waver」アプリを入れ、Digitの言葉を翻訳できるか試してみた。Digitがアイテムをつかみ損ねたときの音は「失敗した :( 」と翻訳された。続くビープ音は次のタスクを知らせているようだ。

GTC 2025の会場ではせっせと食料品をつかんでいたDigitだが、ふだんは倉庫に配備され、終日働くこともあるという。ただし安全上の理由から、Digitが作業する場所は人間の従業員が働いている場所とは区切られた、閉鎖されたエリアとなっている。今後の技術革新により、いずれは人間とDigitが一緒に働けるようにしたいと同社は考えている。

「この目標に向けて、安全な人間検知技術の開発に取り組んでいるところだ。この技術を18カ月以内に次世代ロボットに組み込みたい」とVelagapudi氏は意気込む。

Boston DynamicsのAtlas

Boston Dynamicsの人型ロボット「Atlas」はGTC 2025には出展されていなかったが、CTOのAaron Saunders氏は登壇者として参加していた。パネルディスカッションの後、米CNETはSaunders氏とAtlasの最新の動画について話す機会を得た。この動画にはAtlasが側転し、ブレイクダンスを踊り、走る姿が収められている。

「まずはスタッフがモーションキャプチャー用のスーツを着て一連の動作をする」とSaunders氏は説明する。「1つのモーションキャプチャーをもとに、一晩かけてポリシーをトレーニングし、ロボットに学習させる。現在では、かなり安定した動作が可能だ」

ロボティクスや機械学習における「ポリシー」とは、ロボットやAIエージェントが現在の状態をもとに、次に何をすべきかをどう判断するかを定めたものだ。Saunders氏によると、次は特定のタスクだけでなく、幅広いタスクや行動に対応できる汎用的なポリシーの開発を目指すという。

DisneyのBDX Droidとキャラクターロボットたち

最後に紹介するのは、他社とはまったく異なる「ストーリーテリング」という目的のために長年、ロボットを作ってきたDisneyだ。ストーリーを語るロボットには独自の課題が伴う。

展示会場を歩き回っていた「BDX Droid」たちは、人間のオペレーターによって遠隔制御されていた。オペレーターの巧みな操作がロボットに個性を与え、愛嬌たっぷりの動きで人々を魅了する。

Disney Research のアソシエート・ラボ・ディレクターで、BDX Droidプロジェクトを率いたMoritz Bacher氏は、人間による巧みな制御とロボットの自律的な動きを絶妙なバランスで両立させることが重要だと語る。「通常はオペレーターがクリエイティブディレクターのような役割を果たす。しかし複雑なキャラクターの場合、ジョイスティックやボタンの操作だけでは制御しきれないため、ロボットが自律的に動くことが求められる」とBacher氏は言う。

BDX Droidは自律的にバランスを取りながら移動できるため、オペレーター（つまり、クリエイティブディレクター）はキャラクターを生き生きと動かす作業に集中できる。

この日、Bacher氏は会場で講演し、人型ロボットの開発を含めて、Disneyが現在進めているロボティクス研究を紹介した。詳細は今後、動画で公開される予定だ。

GTC 2025は学びにあふれていた。ロボティクス業界が解決しようとしている課題を知り、ロボットの多彩な用途に目を見張った。ロボットの可能性は広がるばかりだ。

chatgpt free tier will get 3 generations per day soon. — Sam Altman (@sama) March 27, 2025

Of course, OpenAI's GPUs and servers are not actually melting, but if demand increases, power consumption increases, and requests can be slower. To address the surge in requests, Altman said, ""We will introduce temporary rate limits while improving efficiency"" and ""ChatGPT's free plan will soon allow for three generations per day.""

This is not uncommon for image generation, and upgrading to a paid plan is usually guaranteed to produce faster and more stable. It's similar to avoiding queues with Disney's fast pass. When this new feature was released, there were no particular restrictions.

Within just a few hours of ChatGPT's new image generation capabilities, a trend has emerged, and many users have been generating Studio Ghibli-style images. Altman himself also changed X's profile image to a Ghibli style. However, tensions between creators and AI companies continue to rise. As Brian Merchant, technology writer for Blood in the Machine, points out, Studio Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki said of AI footage that he ""feels an insult to life,"" so OpenAI would say it's an interesting choice.

How to use ChatGPT's new image generation feature

Through day-to-day activities, Garmin Connect+ provides insights and suggestions based on health and activity data, and uses customizable graphs and charts across different periods to give you a broader perspective on progress.

The ""Live Activity"" function allows you to check real-time heart rate and pace information on your smartphone. Additionally, the LiveTrack feature allows you to notify family and friends that an activity has started. Training plans Garmin Run Coach and Garmin Cycling Coach will receive additional professional guidance, including educational content and videos. If you complete it, you will also be unlocked with limited challenges that allow you to earn a badge.

Garmin's efforts are part of a major trend in the technology industry to leverage AI to provide an optimized experience for each user. Wearable developers like Whoop, Strava and Oura are already using AI to provide training and summaries tailored to the activity of their users. In oura Ring, an AI chatbot helps interpret the collected data. Samsung and Google are also working on AI-powered insights.

Garmin Connect+ costs $6.99 per month (1,180 yen in Japan) and $69.99 per year (11,800 yen in Japan), and also offers a 30-day free trial.

From hardware to service

David McQueen, director of market research firm ABI Research, said that at present, only a few companies that offer premium devices are using AI in their wearable products.

""Many other companies will also be trying to incorporate AI into their wearable products, lower prices, and provide a broader ecosystem to pursue more accurate and personalized services.""

Garmin's entry into subscription services is also worth noting. This is because paid plans have often been linked to smart rings (especially Oura Rings).

""We don't see much of this kind of service on other wearable devices yet,"" he says.

At the same time, the smart ring business model will be diversified, he said, and some manufacturers are looking for ways to provide basic app features that can be used without subscriptions to acquire users and expand the ecosystem.

https://cnet.com,Google makes Android development process private -- What information can no longer be confirmed?,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231098/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 16:00:00 GMT","Google plans to privately develop the Android OS for mobile devices, so people outside the company will no longer be able to see the development process. This change is a major shift for Android, which has shown behind the scenes of development to developers and everyone, among others.

However, the average user should not feel any impact. Explain the changes, their background and expected impacts.

What will change with Android?

Up until now, Google has developed Android mainly in two branches. One is an internal branch, and the other is a public branch called the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). With AOSP, anyone could make a contribution to checking Android development status and improving it, but behind the scenes, Google's internal team did most of the work. AOSP tends to have a slower development pace than internal branches, and it took developers to check for new features and updates.

Google has officially announced that it will migrate all Android development to Android Authority, which publishes Android-related news, to internal branches. Completed Android versions will continue to be provided on the public branch, but update information will not be shared until the official release is ready. This is expected to help Google streamline its development process and avoid the problems that arise when attempting to integrate separate branches.

Google's aim

The main reason for this change in policy is the efficiency of Android development. Google currently takes a lot of time and effort to integrate public AOSP code with private code. By integrating it into a single branch, the company aims to speed up development and reduce potential mistakes. This change does not mean closing saucer Android. Google will provide the source code as soon as a new version of Android is ready. This simply means that progress will no longer be shared in real time as before.

Do users feel an impact?

You probably won't feel it. For most Android users, this change does not affect daily use. The impact of Android updates on smartphones remains the same, and applications will be developed and updated as before. The real change is that Android enthusiasts and developers will no longer be able to easily view the development process, at least until new updates are ready to be delivered.

The most affected are developers and technical reporters. Developers who build custom ROMs or work with AOSP may find it difficult to follow the evolution as they will no longer be able to track development in detail. It would be a shame for technical reporters to no longer be able to get leaks of pre-publication information from AOSP. This leak is often hinting at the next generation of features and devices. For example, recently, the leak that the Pixel 10 was introduced in the AOSP code gave us a glimpse into Google's future plans.

When will this change be implemented?

The change is scheduled to take place from the week of March 30th, and the official announcement from Google is expected to be in the second half of the week of the 23rd. From then on, all Android development will be private and will only be made public when the source code is provided.",cnet
https://cnet.com,"Security threats change even further, including the spread of attacks targeting SaaS--Cloud Strike",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231100/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:36:00 GMT","クラウドストライクは3月28日、2025年版グローバル脅威レポートを公開し、メディア向けに解説を行った。同社が監視する脅威アクターがさらに増加し、SaaSへの攻撃拡大や手法の高度化などの変化もより進んでいる状況だと指摘している。

このレポートは、2024年における同社の脅威インテリジェンスから判明したセキュリティ脅威の動向をとりまとめたもの。解説を担当したファルコン コンプリート マネージャーの鵜沢裕一氏は、「脅威アクターの年だったと言える」と総括した。

脅威アクターとは、サイバー攻撃やサイバー犯罪を行う人間や組織などの総称。鵜沢氏は、アクターには、国家の支援を受けて機密情報の窃取などを狙うタイプ、金銭の獲得を狙うタイプ、主義・主張を知らしめることを目的にする「ハクティビスト」の3種類があると解説。企業や組織のセキュリティ対策では、個々の攻撃を防ぐことに主眼を置きがちだが、鵜沢氏は、自組織を狙う脅威アクターのタイプ、動機、目的にも目を向けるべきと説いた。



クラウドストライク ファルコン コンプリート マネージャーの鵜沢裕一氏 クラウドストライク ファルコン コンプリート マネージャーの鵜沢裕一氏

クラウドストライクは長期にわたり脅威アクターの活動を追跡しているといい、2024年の対象アクター数は26件増の257件、さらに脅威アクターとなる恐れのある集団が140件あるとした。

また、同社が分析した2024年の全体的な脅威動向では、音声を使うフィッシング攻撃の「Vishing（Voice Phishing）」が442％増、初期段階の不正侵入に特化したアクターの「アクセスブローカー」が50％増となり、攻撃全体のうち初期段階の不正侵入で悪用された脆弱（ぜいじゃく）性が52％を占めた。不正侵入に成功した脅威アクターが侵害を拡大する「ラテラルムーブメント（横展開）」を開始するまでの時間も近年は数十分単位で短くなっており、2024年同社が検知した最速のケースは51秒だったという。

人間をだますフィッシング攻撃は、技術的なサイバーセキュリティの防御を講じることが難しい人の心理につけ込むため、脅威アクターが多用する「ソーシャルエンジニアリング」と呼ばれる手法の一つになる。

例えば、同社が2024年に遮断した「Curly Spider」と呼ぶ脅威アクターの攻撃では、標的に膨大なスパムメールを送り付けて、その対応で標的を疲弊させる。次にアクターは、その状態の標的に「ITサポート」のVishingで接近し、標的を巧妙な攻撃サイトにアクセスさせて、標的の認証情報を窃取する。脅威アクターは、この認証情報を使って初期侵入し、正規のITツールを悪用して侵入先のシステムに不正プログラムを設置したり設定を変更したりするなどして、永続的に侵入可能な状態にしようとした。ただし、この攻撃は検知から4分未満で阻止されたという。



「Curly Spider」によるソーシャルエンジニアリングから不正侵入を狙った攻撃の流れ（出典：クラウドストライク） 「Curly Spider」によるソーシャルエンジニアリングから不正侵入を狙った攻撃の流れ（出典：クラウドストライク）

このほかに鵜沢氏は、2024年の特徴的な脅威動向として、クラウドの侵害、脆弱性攻撃、SaaSへの攻撃を挙げた。

クラウドの侵害は25％増加し、このうち有効な認証情報が悪用されたケースが35％を占めた。クラウドを侵害する脅威アクターは、侵入先のクラウド環境の悪用にとどまらず、昨今ではクラウド上の大規模言語モデル（LLM）も悪用し始めているという。特に中国と北朝鮮の支援を受ける脅威アクターが増加しているとした。

脆弱性攻撃では、特に日常的に厳格な監視が難しく、ファームウェアの積極的な更新などが行われていないネットワーク通信機器が狙われているとのこと。また、脆弱性対策では、危険度や重要度が高いものに優先して対応することがセオリーとされてきたが、鵜沢氏は「異なる低レベルの脆弱性を組み合わせて悪用の成功率を高める『チェーンエクスプロイト』が拡大している」と警鐘を鳴らす。

SaaSへの攻撃では、「Microsoft 365」が頻繁に狙われているといい、全体のうち「Microsoft SharePoint」の侵害が22％、「Outlook」の侵害が17％を占めていた。上述のフィッシング攻撃などで脅威アクターに窃取された認証情報が悪用されており、鵜沢氏は多要素認証の強化と設定不備の修正の徹底などが肝心とアドバイスした。

これら以外にも2024年は、生成AIによる精巧なフィッシングメールやディープフェーク（偽動画）の攻撃も目立つようになり、中国を背景とする脅威アクターの能力がほかの大国と並ぶほどに到達し、同国の地政学的な野心をかなえる攻撃が活発になっているとした。中国を背景とするさまざまな脅威アクターは、標的の国・地域、業界別で特化している傾向が見られるという。

最後に鵜沢氏は、脅威対策では認証情報などのアイデンティティーやクラウドの保護の重要性が高まり、オンプレミスやクラウドの異なる環境を横断した脅威への対応が必要だとし、今後は自組織を狙う脅威アクターの正体を理解しての対策も求められると話した。",cnet

NEC and Kyodo Shoji Coed Brewery (Coed Brewery, Kawagoe City, Saitama Prefecture) announced on March 28th that NEC's ""Agentic AI"" has devised and developed a craft beer called ""Yami Brewery."" Using AI, four types of craft beer have been jointly developed that express the characteristics and values ​​of each generation in their 20s and 50s, and is positioned as ""AI craft beer that allows you to experience the lives that four generations have passed.""



Chiba Yuki (left), Head of Business Development Division for NEC Generation AI, Holding ""Life Brewing Craft"" developed with Agentic AI, and Asagiri Shigeharu, CEO of Coed Brewery (right), Head of Business Development Division for NEC Generation AI, Holding ""Life Brewing Craft"" developed with Agentic AI, and Asagiri Shigeharu, CEO of Coed Brewery (right),

Pre-orders for Seikabushi Craft will begin on April 1st at the official Coed Brewery online store, and will be shipped sequentially from June 5th. The price of a set of 4 bottles including tax is 1,980 yen. They prepare 2,000 sets for the first lot, and will rebrew them after seeing the reaction.

Agentic AI uses NEC's own large-scale language model (LLM) cotomi, and this time it will support beer development. Cotomi analyzed modern Japanese people, created personas for each generation, understood the target customers, and created recipe proposals based on recipe information and other information. Simply enter the image of the beer you are developing at the prompt and you will automatically perform the work to this extent.

At the prompt, he was able to obtain a recipe proposal by entering the following: ""Imagine a Japanese person in his 20s, and using recipe information from both inside and outside the company as a reference, creating a new craft beer recipe."" Furthermore, AI and the beer craftsman discussed the recipe proposal on the chat screen, and added these opinions to the final completion.

Asagiri Shigeharu, CEO of Coed Brewery, said, ""It feels like craftsmen and AI are at the opposite ends, but I thought that an environment where people can work together rather than conflicts will be created. In the past, we have been able to receive more awards from the collective knowledge of craftsmen, but with Agentic AI, it seems like one new team member has added more skilled. They have made new proposals for making beer, and craftsmen can hit the walls. This is probably the first time that AI and beer craftsmen have co-created. By quantifying and analyzing them, we will also work to ensure that people can drink with peace of mind.""

Chiba Yuki, Head of Business Development, NEC Generation AI, said, ""NEC's AI has the ability to cleverly and efficiently disassemble operations against vague instructions as a unique feature. We are proud to be suitable for realizing Agent AI, which can handle advanced specialized tasks and complex business processes. It can evolve from being a tool to being trusted and entrusted to ""buddy.""",cnet

This time, we will introduce the ""explicit statements"" of Furuichi Riki, Executive Vice President and Head of the Japan Regional Region at Workday, and Adachi Keisuke, Executive Vice President and CEO of KPMG Consulting, Executive Vice President and Rick Transformation Unit Leader/Partner.

""Ensuring centralized management of people and AI agents on our platform.""

(Furuichi Riki, Executive Vice President and Head of the Japan Regional Region, Workday)



Workday Executive President and Head of the Japan Regional Manager Furuichi Riki, Workday Executive President and Head of the Japan Regional Manager Furuichi Riki, Workday Executive President and Head of the Japan Regional Manager

Furuichi, president of Workday, the Japanese subsidiary of Workday, mentioned the above about his efforts at AI agents at a press conference on business strategies that the company recently held. This is realized through a new solution called ""Agent System of Record"" (ASOR), and is an evolution of the previous Workday platform. This is a move I would like to pay attention to in the future, so I have taken it into consideration as a clear statement.

Workday is a software vendor that provides enterprise applications such as Human Capital Management (HCM) and Financial Management through cloud services, with annual revenue of $8.446 billion (FY2025), over 20,400 employees, and over 11,000 global customers. In terms of enterprise application sales, it has a presence behind Oracle, SAP and Salesforce.

Please see the related article for details of the press conference, and here we will focus on Furuichi's opening remarks.

He explained the following while showing Figure 1:



(Figure 1) The concept of the Agent System of Record (ASOR) (Source: Workday press conference material) (Figure 1) The concept of the Agent System of Record (ASOR) (Source: Workday press conference material)

""The Workday platform is used by approximately 70 million users, with approximately 1 trillion transactions moving annually. This is the amount of data accumulated to our company's strength in leveraging AI. By leveraging this data, we currently have eight AI agents listed at the bottom of the diagram.""

""And the newest new product was ASOR. It is a solution that uses the know-how we have cultivated in human resource management to AI agents. There are three patterns of AI agents: not only what we provide, but what our customers have developed themselves, and what other vendors offer, so there are concerns that these will become increasingly common within companies in the future. Furthermore, in managing these, security, governance, and compliance will become essential. ASOR is trying to meet these needs and enable the management of employees and AI agents in the company to centrally manage employees and AI agents.""

ASOR is scheduled to be available from the second half of 2025, and it will be a little while before we can see people centrally managing a wide variety of AI agents, but on the other hand, this may be in line with the timing of increasing demand for many companies.

Regarding ASOR, please refer to the article ""How to manage and utilize a wide variety of AI agents - Exploring Workday's initiatives"" published on March 19th in another series by the author on this site, ""A Word of Saying,"" which explains the background and significance.

To put it another way, ASOR is an evolution of the Workday platform so far. As Furuichi says, as companies are concerned about the uproaring number of AI agents, the need for solutions like ASOR will undoubtedly increase. We'll be looking forward to seeing if the company can become a person who will spark that movement.",cnet
https://techcrunch.com,Elon Musk says xAI acquired X,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/28/elon-musk-says-xai-acquired-x/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Elon Musk’s AI startup, xAI, has acquired his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, in an all-stock deal, he announced in a post on X Friday.

“xAI has acquired X in an all-stock transaction,” Musk said. “The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt).”

Musk went on to describe the two companies’ futures as “intertwined.” He added, “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent.”

The acquisition places X — the highly influential social media platform Musk purchased in 2022 under its former name, Twitter — firmly under the umbrella of Musk’s AI startup, which he founded in 2023 to compete with OpenAI. While xAI’s products, including its AI chatbot Grok, were tightly integrated into the X platform before this deal, Friday’s acquisition further combines two of Musk’s most high-profile companies.

Musk — who also leads Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink — notes in his post that this deal values X at $33 billion (lowered from an enterprise value of $45 billion due to the company’s $12 billion in debt). Musk originally purchased X for $44 billion in October 2022 and took it private. However, the valuation has swung dramatically in recent years. At one point, Fidelity valued X at less than $10 billion.

In the months since the inauguration of President Donald Trump — for whom Musk campaigned for aggressively, and now serves under as a special advisor leading DOGE — X’s valuation has risen, largely because investors believe the platform more influential now. Musk said in his post on Friday that X now has more than 600 million active users.

Musk launched xAI in 2023 and has since beefed up the startup with industry leading AI researchers from Google DeepMind, Microsoft, and OpenAI, and built out the massive AI data centers to catch up with other frontier AI developers. To fuel these efforts, Musk has gone on a historic fundraising campaign, including a $6 billion funding round in December that valued the startup at $45 billion. According to Musk, xAI’s valuation is now even higher, at $80 billion.

xAI has largely been successful in its mad dash to catch up with OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. In February, the startup released Grok 3, a frontier AI model that’s competitive with the industry’s leading AI models on benchmarks measuring math, science, and coding.

But xAI’s successes have not stopped Musk from meddling with OpenAI, a startup he cofounded with Sam Altman. Musk is currently trying to thwart OpenAI’s for-profit transition — which it needs to complete to secure future funding — in more ways than one. The billionaire owner of xAI has made OpenAI’s for-profit transition the centerpiece of his lawsuit against OpenAI. Musk also submitted a $97 billion takeover bid for Altman’s startup in February, which OpenAI’s board promptly rejected, but it already may have driven up the market price for OpenAI’s assets.

One of the major advantages that xAI has over OpenAI and other startups is its access to X. The large body of posts that X has accumulated over the years gives xAI a significant advantage in the race for AI training data. Further, X gives Musk’s AI startup a huge consumer app to reach users in.

Musk has a history for blurring the lines between his many companies, which has landed him in legal trouble before. With xAI’s acquisition of X, the two are now effectively one — and the move suggests that X’s true value may lie in advancing Musk’s broader AI ambitions.",techcrunch

But those startups won’t necessarily be financial technology companies. In a post on X, Rotman — who helped start QED in 2007 — declared that “the first business” that he plans “on getting out of the ground is in the music industry.”

He wrote: “It’s easy to call me crazy for all the obvious reasons, but it’s worth reserving judgment until you learn more about the business that’s evolved in my head and sat on the shelf for years. It will be fun to build and could actually make a huge difference to an industry that none of us could imagine living without.”

Rotman started Alexandria, Virginia-based QED, which today has $4 billion in assets under management, nearly two decades ago with Nigel Morris and Caribou Honig. He led the firm’s investment in Credit Karma and played a role in QED’s investments in unicorns such as GreenSky, Flywire, and SoFi. (In fact, QED was the first institutional money into Credit Karma.) Other companies that the firm has backed include Creditas, Nubank, AvidXchange, and Bitso.

QED exclusively invests in companies building financial technology at the pre-seed to Series A stages.

Rotman, who goes by the handle “The Fintech Junkie” on X, said he will transition to his new role on January 1, 2026. He will continue to serve in a part-time advisory role to QED over the coming years.

Besides founding music startups, Rotman said he likely plans to write a book centered around his “observations and frameworks for the startup and VC worlds.”

He wrote in the X post: “This shouldn’t surprise anyone who knows me – writing is my oxygen. I can’t imagine a life without it even though ChatGPT and Claude are better writers than I am.”

In a statement, QED Managing Partner Nigel Morris noted that he and Rotman had worked together for over 30 years — previously also at Capital One.

“Frank, at his core, is an entrepreneur and I have no doubt he will excel in his next chapter,” he said.

QED Investors’ partner Amias Gerety will be promoted to lead QED’s U.S. investment team.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,"‘Tesla Takedown’ protesters are planning a global day of action on March 29, and things might get ugly",https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/28/tesla-takedown-protesters-are-planning-a-global-day-of-action-on-march-29-and-things-might-get-ugly/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","“Tesla Takedown” organizers have promised their biggest day of global action this weekend, encouraging thousands to protest outside Tesla showrooms, dealerships, and even charging stations to peacefully object to Elon Musk’s role in slashing government spending.

As Tesla protests have spread, so has the backlash. Activists holding up signs are being conflated with masked vandals throwing Molotov cocktails. On social media, and in Washington, the distinction is fading fast.

President Donald Trump has called attacks on Tesla “domestic terrorism” and threatened to send “terrorist thugs” to prisons in El Salvador. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has pledged to prosecute “those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes,” even though evidence suggests the attacks were carried out by “lone offenders.” And Musk’s decision to accuse at least one peaceful protester of “committing crimes” on X has fueled a public discourse that equates protest with vandalism, and vandalism with terrorism.

If the government or law enforcement starts treating all anti-Tesla actions as criminal, peaceful protesters could find themselves facing consequences meant for extremists.

“Terrorism is a problematic concept in law enforcement because it is by definition differentiated from other violence by its political nature,” Mike German, a former FBI special agent and fellow at the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program, told TechCrunch. “That’s why we’ve seen counterterrorism measures so often result in problematic outcomes targeting the civil rights of people engaged in First Amendment-protected activity, rather than the people who are committing acts of violence.”

The Tesla Takedown protesters have consistently preached nonviolence at rallies and on their website. The movement’s stated goal is not to physically harm Tesla or Musk, but rather to encourage people to sell their Teslas, sell their stock, and stop buying new Teslas.

“The reason that [Musk] is in the position that he is in is because of his wealth, and we feel that if we can continue to drive that Tesla stock price down, we will hit him in the spot that it matters,” Natasha Purdum, a New Jersey-based organizer, told TechCrunch. “Ultimately, we see that as a key to taking down some of the major destruction that is happening in our federal government, courtesy of DOGE and Elon Musk.”

Musk is the world’s richest person in large part due to his Tesla stock. He owns roughly 13% of the company, which today is valued at around $829 billion, making Musk’s share worth around $107.8 billion. That wealth has allowed Musk to spend $44 billion to buy Twitter, the primary platform he uses to communicate to his 219 million followers. Musk has also dipped into his own funds to donate more than $260 million to the America PAC that helped Trump clinch the election.

As someone who spent 16 years as an FBI special agent focused on domestic terrorism, German says he wouldn’t be surprised to see local police working hand in glove with terrorism taskforces — like the one the FBI just formed — to monitor Tesla Takedown protests. Per the Attorney General’s Guidelines, the FBI doesn’t require a factual basis for a suspicion of terrorism to begin conducting physical surveillance, which includes taking photos of people, cars, and license plates, deploying informants to infiltrate a group, accessing private databases, and more.

“It’s also important to understand that law enforcement in the United States is primarily intended to protect the property of the wealthy,” German said. “Corporations in the United States are politically powerful and have access to elected officials and top law enforcement officials. And when their interests are challenged, particularly by protest, they want to present that as a law enforcement issue, rather than as legitimate public concerns about their corporate activities.”

The FBI declined to comment on TechCrunch’s question about whether the agency is taking any special action this weekend.

“We’re going to go after them”

Musk and the Trump administration have ramped up their rhetoric in the lead up to March 29, when at least 213 Tesla Takedown protests are scheduled around the world, from Colorado and Kentucky to Germany, Minnesota, France, and Texas.

On Thursday, Musk appeared on Fox News’ “Special Report” to say that he and Trump are going to “go after…the ones providing the money, the ones pushing the lies and propaganda.”

Trump has suggested that the attacks on Tesla property were coordinated to intimidate Musk, despite internal assessments finding otherwise. Musk has also claimed, without showing proof, that certain Tesla Takedown organizers were funded by ActBlue, a nonprofit that funds progressive causes and Democratic candidates.

And Bondi has accused Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) of “calling for further insurrection” after Crockett said that Musk needed to be “taken down” at a virtual Tesla Takedown rally last week. Crockett couched that statement with calls for nonviolence and peaceful demonstrations, but regardless, Bondi said she needs to “tread very carefully.”

German says this rhetoric, too, is an old government trick to try to discredit and suppress protest movements by claiming “a handful of acts of violence are the result of the spread of bad ideas, radical ideas.”

Purdum, one of the Tesla organizers, advised protesters to put their wellbeing first. Leave if you feel unsafe, adhere to your local protest regulations, don’t trespass, follow police orders, and have a lawyer’s number in your back pocket just in case, she said.

“Authoritarian regimes have a long history of equating peaceful protest with violence,” Stephanie Frizzell, a Tesla Takedown organizer from Dallas, said. “The Tesla Takedown movement has always been and will remain nonviolent. Their goal is to intimidate us into silence as we stand against Musk’s destructive actions — but defending free speech is fundamental to democracy. We will not be deterred.”",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,OpenAI peels back ChatGPT’s safeguards around image creation,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/28/openai-peels-back-chatgpts-safeguards-around-image-creation/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","This week, OpenAI launched a new image generator in ChatGPT, which quickly went viral for its ability to create Studio Ghibli-style images. Beyond the pastel illustrations, GPT-4o’s native image generator significantly upgrades ChatGPT’s capabilities, improving picture editing, text rendering, and spatial representation.

However, one of the most notable changes OpenAI made this week involves its content moderation policies, which now allow ChatGPT to, upon request, generate images depicting public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features.

OpenAI previously rejected these types of prompts for being too controversial or harmful. But now, the company has “evolved” its approach, according to a blog post published Thursday by OpenAI’s model behavior lead, Joanne Jang.

“We’re shifting from blanket refusals in sensitive areas to a more precise approach focused on preventing real-world harm,” said Jang. “The goal is to embrace humility: recognizing how much we don’t know, and positioning ourselves to adapt as we learn.”

These adjustments seem to be part of OpenAI’s larger plan to effectively “uncensor” ChatGPT. OpenAI announced in February that it’s starting to change how it trains AI models, with the ultimate goal of letting ChatGPT handle more requests, offer diverse perspectives, and reduce topics the chatbot refuses to work with.

Under the updated policy, ChatGPT can now generate and modify images of Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and other public figures that OpenAI did not previously allow. Jang says OpenAI doesn’t want to be the arbiter of status, choosing who should and shouldn’t be allowed to be generated by ChatGPT. Instead, the company is giving users an opt-out option if they don’t want ChatGPT depicting them.

In a white paper released Tuesday, OpenAI also said it will allow ChatGPT users to “generate hateful symbols,” such as swastikas, in educational or neutral contexts, as long as they don’t “clearly praise or endorse extremist agendas.”

Moreover, OpenAI is changing how it defines “offensive” content. Jang says ChatGPT used to refuse requests around physical characteristics, such as “make this person’s eyes look more Asian” or “make this person heavier.” In TechCrunch’s testing, we found ChatGPT’s new image generator fulfills these types of requests.

Additionally, ChatGPT can now mimic the styles of creative studios — such as Pixar or Studio Ghibli — but still restricts imitating individual living artists’ styles. As TechCrunch previously noted, this could rehash an existing debate around the fair use of copyrighted works in AI training datasets.

It’s worth noting that OpenAI is not completely opening the floodgates to misuse. GPT-4o’s native image generator still refuses a lot of sensitive queries, and in fact, it has more safeguards around generating images of children than DALL-E 3, ChatGPT’s previous AI image generator, according to GPT-4o’s white paper.

But OpenAI is relaxing its guardrails in other areas after years of conservative complaints around alleged AI “censorship” from Silicon Valley companies. Google previously faced backlash for Gemini’s AI image generator, which created multiracial images for queries such as “U.S. founding fathers” and “German soldiers in WWII,” which were obviously inaccurate.

Now, the culture war around AI content moderation may be coming to a head. Earlier this month, Republican Congressman Jim Jordan sent questions to OpenAI, Google, and other tech giants about potential collusion with the Biden administration to censor AI-generated content.

In a previous statement to TechCrunch, OpenAI rejected the idea that its content moderation changes were politically motivated. Rather, the company says the shift reflects a “long-held belief in giving users more control,” and OpenAI’s technology is just now getting good enough to navigate sensitive subjects.

Regardless of its motivation, it’s certainly a good time for OpenAI to be changing its content moderation policies, given the potential for regulatory scrutiny under the Trump administration. Silicon Valley giants like Meta and X have also adopted similar policies, allowing more controversial topics on their platforms.

While OpenAI’s new image generator has only created some viral Studio Ghibli memes so far, it’s unclear what the broader effects of these policies will be. ChatGPT’s recent changes may go over well with the Trump administration, but letting an AI chatbot answer sensitive questions could land OpenAI in hot water soon enough.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Breast pump startup Willow acquires assets of Elvie as UK women’s health pioneer moves into administration,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/28/breast-pump-startup-willow-acquires-assets-of-elvie-as-uk-womens-health-pioneer-moves-into-administration/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Women’s health and its startups building connected breast pumps, period trackers, and other apps and hardware designed for women have collectively pulled in more than $5 billion in funding in the last five years, but the market is tight, and now, two of the trailblazers in the space are coming together as consolidation beckons.

Willow, the San Francisco startup that made its name with wearable breast pumps, is acquiring Elvie, which started with a smart Kegel trainer before expanding to other products for new mothers, including its own breast pumps and most recently, a bassinet.

Terms of the deal have not been disclosed but we understand that it’s coming as Elvie enters administration. The London startup raised more than $186 million over the last 12 years with investors, including Octopus Ventures, BlackRock, and Blume Equity, among others. Its last valuation was $241 million, per data from PitchBook.

The companies have been in conversation for some time, after Willow approached Elvie to buy it. But as talks progressed, Elvie also approached the end of its runway.

“The transaction is taking shape after many months of alternative expectations,” Willow CEO Sarah O’Leary said in an interview.

We understand Willow is taking on the existing business, including its products and team. There are currently 170 people working across London and Bristol, although some of those are already working out their notice periods and won’t be coming on to Willow.

For its part, Willow has raised around $254 million in a combination of equity and debt with investors, including the likes of NEA and Meritech. Its valuation, per PitchBook, had risen to as much as $256 million in 2021 (a high watermark for venture funding in general) but had dropped in 2024 when the company raised a combination of equity and debt.

O’Leary, who stepped into the CEO role at the end of 2023, declined to comment on its current valuation but said that the company may be looking to raise more later this year.

Elvie’s tip into bankruptcy speaks to some of the wider challenges in the world of women’s health, which is estimated to be a $60 billion market this year but has faced a number of headwinds. The market since 2021 has continued to be challenging for later-stage startups, especially those that are not focused almost solely on AI. There are not a lot of exit opportunities for women’s health businesses at the moment. Plus, as O’Leary points out, the market (eyeing that $60 billion figure, no doubt) has been flooded with a plethora of cheaper products.

The recent drama with 23andMe also highlights some of the big issues with managing user data, especially health data, when things go awry with the business. And that is perhaps even more the case with women’s health and reproductive businesses in the current political climate.



And, as ever, hardware — or at least the ability to turn hardware startups into profitable businesses — remains hard.

Willow’s hope is that its acquisition of Elvie marks the start of some wider consolidation and Willow’s own efforts to build out a wider platform: If exit opportunities are few and far between, then make your own platform and become the consolidator.

Women’s health as a category really arose over the years as it became, thanks to the cloud, smartphones and innovations in big data analytics, easier-to-build apps to engage with the market, and hardware prototypes launched via crowdfunding platforms to gauge consumer interest. These products also came out of a more empowered demographic demanding tech to meeting their own needs. Now Willow’s challenge — and opportunity — will be to see if it can convert that into profit over time.

“We want to show that femtech products are not only great stories, but great businesses,” she said.",techcrunch

On the YouTube podcast Colin and Samir, Zuckerberg spoke about the one and only time he saw “The Social Network.”

“It was weird, man,” he said. “They got all these very specific details of what I was wearing, or these specific things correct, but then the whole narrative arc around my motivations and all this stuff were like, completely wrong.”

The 15-year-old movie only came up in conversation because Zuckerberg was wearing a T-shirt that Jesse Eisenberg wore when portraying the young founder on screen — Zuckerberg later bought the T-shirt at an auction. Although Zuckerberg used to be known for wearing plain grey T-shirts, he’s since paid a lot more attention to his style, so it’s likely that his T-shirt choice was not an accident.

Zuckerberg said that he knew his employees would be curious to see it anyway, so he arranged for the company to go watch it together.

“The whole arc is like, I’m somehow motivated by trying to find a girlfriend, [but] I was dating Priscilla before I started Facebook.”

Perhaps this portrayal of Zuckerberg stems from another notorious website he created while a student: Facemash, an app where students could vote on which of their classmates was the hottest. While the service was popular among some students, it angered others who felt it was a violation of their privacy; he had scraped his classmates’ student ID photos from private servers to make the site.

“It’s an unfortunate part of the internet, how people kind of make up a lot of the founding mythology to what they want,” Zuckerberg said.

He denies the idea that Facemash was a precursor to Facebook, claiming that after over two decades, people still link Facemash and Facebook due to “The Social Network.”

“I was just a kid,” Zuckerberg said.",techcrunch

Milton was convicted in October 2022 of One Count of Securities Fraud and Two Counts of Wire Fraud Related to Claims He made about Nikola's Progress to Investors. He was sentenced to four years in prison in december 2023. He has been out on a $ 100 million bond while he appealed that sentence.

The Pardon Comes Just a Few Weeks After Nikola Filed for Chapter 11 BankRuptcy. The Company has been working with the bankruptcy court in delaware to try to sell the business, and had hoped to close such a deal by mid-April.

""It is no wonder why trust and confidence in the justice department has eroded to nothing. In Wish Judges would stop beliefing whatever the prosecutors feed them so americans could trust the justice system again,"" Milton Said in a statement.

Milton was convicted by a jury. He was represented in that trial by Brad Bondi, a partner at Law Firm Paul Hastings and the Brother of Current U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Now a free man, mildon has said he plans to release a documentary that he Believes will tell his side of the nikola story.

Milton founded Nikola in 2014. The Company Didn't Enter The Spotlight Until 2020, When It Beacame One of the First Electric Vehicle Companies to Go Public By Merging With A Special Purpose Accquisition Company (SPAC). It Quickly Became A Hotly Traded Stock, Especially After General Motors Announced A $ 2 Billion Stake in September of That Year.

The Company's Circumstances Quickly Changed, Though. Just Days After GM's Announcement, Short-Selling Research Firm Hindenburg Research Published A Report Containing Allegations of Fraud Perpetrated by Milton. The Securities and Exchange Commission Opened An Investigation, and GM Walked Away from the Deal. Milton ultimately resigned, Although during his sentencing heaearing in 2023 he claimed he stepped down to help his ailing wife.

Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York Charged Milton in July 2021, Claiming That He Had Made ""False and Misleading Statements Regarding Nikola's Product and Technology Development,"" On Social Media and In TV, Print, and PODCAST. They Said Milton Made These Claims in Order to ""Induce Retail Investors to Purchase Nikola Stock.""

After he was convicted, a judge ordered mildon to pay his forms company nearly $ 168 million following an arbitration case between the two sides. That Money was supposed to factor into Nikola's Bankruptcy Case. Nikola planned to use those proceeds to setle a class action lawsuit against the company filed by shareholders.",techcrunch

It’s a little weird to announce this the day after a Nintendo Direct livestream, where the gaming company usually unloads all of its recent news. But that was intentional. The company wants fans to download its new app, Nintendo Today! — yes, that exclamation is their own doing — to learn the latest news.

During Thursday’s Nintendo Direct event, Nintendo game director Shigeru Miyamoto closed out the presentation by announcing the Nintendo Today! news app. Those who swiftly downloaded it were rewarded since Nintendo used this channel exclusively to announce the release date of its “Zelda” movie.

The app aims to deliver daily news about various Nintendo games, and users can customize the app to prioritize their favorite franchises.

Across the entertainment industry, there are so many new movies and TV shows based on existing IP that this reminder about the “Zelda” movie may fall flat.

For Nintendo, investing in existing IP has proven a financially sound strategy. Its “Super Mario Bros.” movie grossed $1.3 billion at the box office with a $100 million production budget, making it the 18th-highest grossing global release of all time.

While “Zelda” might not have quite the same universal recognition as “Mario,” keep in mind that the “Breath of the Wild” game sold more than 34 million copies, more than the Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal games.

As Nintendo prepares to unveil more information about its highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 system next week, perhaps we should keep a closer eye on the Nintendo Today! app for early details.",techcrunch

You might recall an investigation the team here at TechCrunch published in February on the people in Elon Musk’s DOGE universe. The article, which continues to be updated, focused on those working for the Department of Government Efficiency, an entity established via President Trump’s executive order. A new report, by another team here at TechCrunch, focuses on the founders and VCs working with DOGE. Check it out!

Speaking of Musk, his close ally Trump has placed 25% tariffs on all cars imported to the United States, including those from Mexico and Canada. He’s also placed a 25% tariff on certain parts used to build cars. As reporter Sean O’Kane notes, it’s a decision that will likely supercharge the cost of new and used cars, but it’s also a gift to Tesla, the company run by Musk, his biggest financial supporter in the presidential election.

And finally, in other am-I-in-a-simulation news, Trevor Milton, the founder of bankrupt hydrogen trucking startup Nikola who was convicted of fraud, has been pardoned by Trump, the White House confirmed to TechCrunch. Tidbit: We waited for hours and hours before the White House would confirm.

The startup news this week was very much a mixed bag, with one public exit finalized and another delayed and a flurry of other developments, both promising and disappointing.

Churn concerns: TechCrunch learned that several companies with logos on 11x’s website were not actual customers of the a16z- and Benchmark-backed startup. Sources also said used 11x used creative ways to calculate annual recurring revenue.

Further delays: Cerebras Systems saw its IPO delayed again. The AI chipmaker filed to go public in 2024, but its national security review has been dragging on.

Nuclear: Terrestrial Energy, a U.S. nuclear startup that develops small modular reactors, went public via SPAC and is expecting to net $280 million. Meanwhile, Bill Gates-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems hit a key milestone to construct its demonstration reactor.

Not enough: Vertical farming company Plenty filed for bankruptcy after raising nearly $1 billion in funding from investors, including SoftBank Investment Advisers, Walmart, Bezos Expeditions, and Jeff Bezos as an angel investor.

Layoffs: Block, the fintech startup co-founded by Jack Dorsey, laid off 931 people, according to a leaked email. The company, which owns Cash App and Square, already conducted layoffs in 2024.

Rumors: Nvidia is reportedly nearing a deal to acquire Lepton AI, a startup that rents out servers powered by its AI chips. And FuriosaAI, a South Korean startup that makes chips for AI applications, is said to have rejected an $800 million acquisition offer from Meta.

The two journalists, who work for the Serbia-based Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN), received suspicious text messages including a link — basically a phishing attack, according to the nonprofit. In one case, Amnesty said its researchers were able to click on the link in a safe environment and see that it led to a domain that they had previously identified as belonging to NSO Group’s infrastructure.

“Amnesty International has spent years tracking NSO Group Pegasus spyware and how it has been used to target activists and journalists,” Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, the head of Amnesty’s Security Lab, told TechCrunch. “This technical research has allowed Amnesty to identify malicious websites used to deliver the Pegasus spyware, including the specific Pegasus domain used in this campaign.”

To his point, security researchers like Ó Cearbhaill who have been keeping tabs on NSO’s activities for years are now so good at spotting signs of the company’s spyware that sometimes all researchers have to do is quickly look at a domain involved in an attack.

In other words, NSO Group and its customers are losing their battle to stay in the shadows.

“NSO has a basic problem: They are not as good at hiding as their customers think,” John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab, a human rights organization that has investigated spyware abuses since 2012, told TechCrunch.

There is hard evidence proving what Ó Cearbhaill and Scott-Railton believe.

In 2016, Citizen Lab published the first technical report ever documenting an attack carried out with Pegasus, which was against a United Arab Emirates dissident. Since then, in less than 10 years, researchers have identified at least 130 people all over the world targeted or hacked with NSO Group’s spyware, according to a running tally by security researcher Runa Sandvik.

The sheer number of victims and targets can in part be explained by the Pegasus Project, a collective journalistic initiative to investigate abuse of NSO Group’s spyware that was based on a leaked list of more than 50,000 phone numbers that was allegedly entered in an NSO Group targeting system.

But there have also been dozens of victims identified by Amnesty, Citizen Lab, and Access Now, another nonprofit that helps protect civil society from spyware attacks, which did not rely on that leaked list of phone numbers.

An NSO Group spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, which included questions about Pegasus invisibility, or lack thereof, and whether NSO Group’s customers are concerned about it.

Apart from nonprofits, NSO Group’s spyware keeps getting caught by Apple, which has been sending notifications to victims of spyware all over the world, often prompting the people who received those notifications to get help from Access Now, Amnesty, and Citizen Lab. These discoveries led to more technical reports documenting spyware attacks carried out with Pegasus, as well as spyware made by other companies.

Perhaps NSO Group’s problem rests in the fact that it sells to countries that use its spyware indiscriminately, including reporters and other members of civil society.

“The OPSEC mistake that NSO Group is making here is continuing to sell to countries that are going to keep targeting journalists and end up exposing themselves,” Ó Cearbhaill said, using the technical term for operational security.",techcrunch

Getting the Gravity into customer hands is a big milestone for Lucid, whose success will hinge on being able to offer vehicle types popular with American drivers.

The Gravity is Lucid’s second vehicle and its first SUV after the Lucid Air sedan series. Lucid opened up orders for the seven-seater SUV in November 2024 and began first deliveries to employees, friends, and family in December.

“We nearly finished building all the vehicles that we wanted to build to put them into our studio and for test drives,” Marc Winterhoff, interim CEO of Lucid, said Thursday evening at a brand activation event in New York City. “And by the end of April, we will resume customer deliveries of the Gravity.”

Lucid employees who spoke to TechCrunch at the event — which featured a surprise mini performance from Cautious Clay — confirmed that the EV maker is busy ramping up Gravity production at its Casa Grande, Arizona factory. Barring any hiccups, that U.S.-based factory will no doubt be a boon for the EV startup amid President Donald Trump’s new 25% auto tariffs.

The $94,900 Gravity has an official EPA range estimate of 450 miles and the performance of a sports car, which the company attributes to its advanced battery technology that allows for a denser, lighter-weight battery that packs a punch.

“With the Lucid Gravity, you don’t have to compromise. You can have it all,” Winterhoff said.",techcrunch

On some days, he would spend only three hours actually caring for patients, with the rest of his workday spent on things like dealing with insurance claims.

There are already dozens, perhaps hundreds, of startups using AI to reduce the notoriously complex admin burden in healthcare. From note-taking specialists like Abridge to AI assistants startup Ambience, these startups are racing to streamline efficiencies. Kerwan, now an entrepreneur, is the founder and CEO of one such company, called Taxo. His startup offers an app that doctors and others use for tasks like getting prior authorizations from insurers, patient intake, and medical billing.

What sets Taxo apart, Kerwan says, is its AI “reasoning engine,” which transparently explains the process behind its decisions to users, helping it build trust with doctors. Reasoning models went mainstream in the AI world late last year by fleshing out their logic openly to users. At Taxo, the tech helps reduce hallucinations while increasing prior authorization approval rates to 98%, compared to an industry average of about 80%, according to Kerwan.

Taxo built its “reasoning engine” by adding a healthcare-specific layer on top of existing models like OpenAI’s and Anthropic’s. It says the system is trained on hard-to-access healthcare data that makes it difficult for others to scrape overnight. “We didn’t want to be steamrolled every time OpenAI launches a new model,” Kerwan told TechCrunch.

The reasoning trend in AI remains early and only really gained traction with the rise of Chinese startup DeepSeek. Investor interest in Taxo, however, suggests there’s a chance for the technique to gain broader adoption beyond foundational AI companies. The startup recently closed a $5 million seed round led by Y Combinator, General Catalyst, and Character Capital.

Founded last year and based in San Francisco, Taxo tells TechCrunch it passed $1 million ARR six months after its launch. It now serves about 15 customers, ranging from clinics to government providers.

When ChatGPT was released, doctors were understandably cautious about using it because they couldn’t trace why and how it was making specific recommendations, Kerwan told TechCrunch. He’s hoping Taxo changes that. “You can see exactly where we got the information and why it’s being given,” he said.",techcrunch

Mozilla has fixed a security bug in its Firefox for Windows browser that was “being exploited in the wild.”

In a brief update, Mozilla said it updated the browser to Firefox version 136.0.4 after identifying and fixing the new bug, tracked as CVE-2025-2857, which presents a “similar pattern” to a bug that Google patched in its Chrome browser earlier this week.

Anyone exploiting the bug could escape Firefox’s sandbox, which limits the browser’s access to other apps and data on the user’s computer.

The bug also affects other browsers with the same codebase as Firefox for Windows, such as the Tor Browser, which also received a patch updating the browser to 14.0.7.

https://techcrunch.com,Google rolls out user choice billing on Google Play in the UK,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/28/google-rolls-out-user-choice-billing-on-google-play-in-the-uk/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Google said today that it will start offering user choice billing in the U.K., giving Google Play developers the ability to use other billing options instead of Google’s own system. The change kicks in on March 29, initially only to non-game developers.

If developers opt for it, they cannot replace Google Play billing altogether. Instead, the third-party route will be offered as an option.

Developers who opt to use an alternative billing option get a 4% discount from the fees they pay to Google (to account for the fees that third parties may also charge). Google typically gets a cut of up to 30% on in-app transactions and paid downloads.

In a blog post announcing the change, Google claimed that more than 90% of developers on its platform are “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with Google Play’s native billing. However, it added, “We recognise that some developers may want more choice in how they process payments. This launch enables developers to offer an additional billing system alongside Google Play’s billing system and users can choose which option to use at checkout.”

The backstory is a little less rosy than Google just being a Nice Guy.

Google’s move is actually a long-awaited response to a Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation dating back to 2022.

At that time, the competition watchdog published a report based on a year-long study of the mobile ecosystem and noted that both Google and Apple’s power in the market could be subject to regulatory scrutiny. The companies’ app stores — where they were the sole in-app billing providers for their respective platforms — was a particular point of focus when investigating Google and Apple’s anticompetitive duopoly status.

That was only the start. In 2023, Google proposed that it could offer user choice billing to developers to settle the antitrust probe. In response, the CMA opened up a consultation and invited developers to provide feedback on Google’s proposal.

The CMA ultimately closed the probe against Google and Apple last year, noting that it planned to use regulatory reforms, such as the digital market competition bill, to regulate these companies in the mobile market.

In the meantime, Google has been permitting billing from third parties elsewhere in response to regulatory pressure to open its app store to more competition.

Countries where Google already offers user choice billing include the U.S., India, Australia, Indonesia, Japan, and the European Economic Area (EEA), which all follow the same commissions and charges as in the U.K.",techcrunch
https://tomshardware.com,Zotac RTX 5090 GPUs with missing ROPs sold at premium price by German retailer,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/zotac-rtx-5090-gpus-with-missing-rops-sold-at-premium-price-by-german-retailer,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 18:09:12 GMT","German electronics retailer Alternate has listed three Zotac GeForce RTX 5090 Solid OC graphics cards as B-stock products, despite these units missing Render Output Units (ROPs).



First spotted by Videocardz, the affected GPUs are reportedly missing 8 out of the expected 176 ROPs, which can potentially negatively impact rasterization performance and rendering efficiency in certain workloads. Notably, Alternate is selling these ‘defective’ GPUs at €2,899 ($3,132.12), a price nearly identical to fully functional RTX 5090 units.

ROPs play a crucial role in finalizing rendered frames, making them particularly important for high-resolution gaming and professional workloads. A reduction in ROPs could lead to slightly lower performance, particularly in 4K gaming and compute-heavy applications. Despite this, Alternate has not meaningfully discounted these defective GPUs, making them a questionable purchase for uninformed buyers.

Zotac raised the price of its entire RTX 50-series lineup just three days ago. The price hikes have essentially eliminated MSRP models, making the RTX 5090 even more expensive across the board. This comes despite Nvidia recently implementing price cuts for its RTX 50-series GPUs in Europe, as reported by The Verge, due to currency fluctuations and market conditions. However, Zotac’s decision to increase prices suggests that consumers may not see the full benefit of Nvidia’s adjustments.

While this situation raises concerns about both transparency and pricing, Alternate has included a note in the product listing, disclosing the missing 8 ROPs. However, the lack of a meaningful discount on these defective units remains a point of contention, as they are priced nearly the same as fully functional models. While the missing ROPs may not severely impact performance in all scenarios, enthusiasts and professionals investing in high-end GPUs should be cautious, as it could result in lower frame rates and reduced rendering speeds in certain applications.

Further complicating matters, the Zotac GeForce RTX 5090 Solid is out-of-stock at most retailers in the EU, making it difficult for consumers to find a standard, fully functional unit at MSRP. A search revealed a listing on Caseking, where the GPU is listed at €3,101.82, significantly higher than the defective units being sold by Alternate. This suggests that supply constraints and increased demand could be playing a role in pricing inconsistencies across different retailers.

With GPU demand still high and pricing trends already unfavorable due to Zotac’s recent price hikes, the listing of defective RTX 5090s at premium prices adds another layer of frustration for consumers. Neither Nvidia nor Zotac has provided a statement regarding why these GPUs have made it to market despite their hardware limitations. For now, prospective buyers are advised to check specifications carefully before making a purchase, even with disclosure present on B-stock listings from retailers like Alternate.",tomshardware

On Thursday, Intel received a final payment of $1.9 billion from SK hynix, whereas the latter officially obtained Intel's NAND IP as well as employees, which will enable Solidigm's teams to work more closely with SK hynix on future products, notes DigiTimes.

""On March 27, 2025, the second closing of the transaction occurred,"" a filing by Intel with the SEC reads. ""The consideration received by Intel at the second closing of the transaction was approximately $1.9 billion, net of certain adjustments.""

The acquisition of Intel's NAND business unfolded in two distinct phases. Initially, in 2021, SK Hynix acquired Intel’s SSD business and NAND memory production facility in Dalian, China, for $6.61 billion. As a result, SK hynix renamed Intel's enterprise SSD business to Solidigm and continued its operations under the new brand name.

However, this phase transferred only the physical assets and SSD-related operations, excluding Intel's intellectual property, R&D infrastructure, and key NAND-focused staff.

Throughout a transitional period, Intel retained direct control over NAND-related intellectual property and essential personnel. This arrangement temporarily restricted Solidigm's ability to fully collaborate on technology development or optimize joint research activities, limiting potential synergies between SK Hynix and Intel's NAND teams.

The transaction concluded fully this month when SK Hynix paid the remaining $1.9 billion (which is less than $2.24 billion it was supposed to pay) to secure Intel's IP, along with R&D resources and the associated technical workforce. With the completion of this stage, Solidigm took over complete operational control, thus enabling unified development efforts.



An Intel spokesperson told Tom's Hardware that this transaction would ""further strengthen Intel’s balance sheet and enhance its financial flexibility.””

A notable challenge arising from the acquisition is the fundamental difference in NAND fabrication technology used by the two companies. Intel historically employed floating gate NAND flash technology, whereas SK hynix has focused primarily on charge trap flash (CTF).

As Solidigm inherited Intel's product lines, parent company SK hynix obviously kept producing floating-gate NAND. In fact, even some of Solidigm's flagship drives based on high-endurance 3D QLC memory rely on floating gate NAND.

Looking forward, SK hynix may want to address complexities posed by dual NAND technologies. It may maintain distinct production lines initially, offering specialized products leveraging each process' strengths, but long-term strategies might involve gradually consolidating around a unified process to reduce complexity and manufacturing overhead.

Without any doubts, Solidigm — Intel's former enterprise SSD unit — has greatly expanded SK hynix's presence in enterprise storage. Despite these NAND-related technical differences, SK hynix clearly intends to use this acquisition strategically to further strengthen its enterprise SSD business.

In addition, with the second phase of the deal complete, the agreement that allowed Intel to produce NAND wafers at SK hynix's Dalian facility has now ended.

""In connection with the second closing of the transaction, the NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement entered into at the first closing of the transaction among Intel, SK hynix and certain affiliated entities, pursuant to which Intel manufactured NAND wafers at SK hynix’s Dalian memory manufacturing facility, has terminated,"" the filing reads.",tomshardware

(SMIC), China's largest contract chipmaker and the world's third largest foundry, broke local laws by secretly recruiting engineers to get experienced staff and gain insights of Taiwanese semiconductor know how, reports Bloomberg. The investigation is part of a broader crackdown on unauthorized activities by Chinese tech companies in Taiwan, notes Nikkei.

Taiwanese authorities raided 34 different locations in six cities between March 18 and March 28. Officials from the Ministry of Justice examined operations linked to 11 Chinese companies and interviewed over 90 people in connection with suspected breaches of local laws concerning talent poaching by Chinese companies. Most of the companies under investigation are involved in the semiconductor sector. Officials said this operation had been in the planning stages since December.

According to a statement published by Nikkei, around 11 companies, the majority from the semiconductor industry, violated Taiwan's cross-strait regulations. Illegally setting up office without the government's knowledge. Of the 90 interviewees, some were witnesses, while others may have broken the law.

The investigation revealed that SMIC used a company registered in Samoa to discreetly recruit engineers in Taiwan. Authorities also found that several other firms had formed unauthorized local entities to carry out hiring for work on advanced projects, including 'high-performance networking,' which is probably how business media describes silicon photonics, an area that is becoming increasingly important for next-generation AI and HPC datacenters. It is unclear whether these entities are linked to SMIC though./

SMIC has 7nm-class and preps to roll-out 6nm-class process technologies, the best production nodes available in China. It produces chips for Huawei's HiSilicon, which tends to develop competitive offerings for client devices as well as AI servers and general-purpose servers. SMIC and Huawei need technologies like silicon photonics for their next-generation offerings.

However, SMIC is not the only company that allegedly poaches engineers from Taiwanese companies. A company called Clounix was found to have poached a large number of specialists from major companies like Intel and Microsoft. It reportedly first disguised itself as a local company and later as a Singapore-based chip designer to avoid oversight. However, Clounix has financial backing from Ant Group, which is affiliated with Alibaba, which is emerging as a large cloud service provider with its own custom silicon division that develop CPUs and special-purpose ASICs for its broad needs, including general-purpose processing and AI workloads.

Interestingly, Chinese entities were not only interested in advanced semiconductor or processor technologies know how. A company that develops display driver ICs has allegedly set up two offices in Tainan and Hsinchu and conducted remote interviews from China to bring in Taiwanese talent. It is unclear whether they wanted Taiwanese engineers to develop DDICs in China.

SMIC has previously been caught misappropriating TSMC's manufacturing technologies. In the early 2000s it even paid for it after appropriate courts sided with TSMC's allegations. Nowadays the company develops its own fabrication processes, but is eager to poach engineers who has experience with the finest production technologies that are out there.

Huawei is a relatively new player in the semiconductor field. However, it is already known for poaching TSMC employees by offering them a trifold higher salary and other benefits. Chinese producers of semiconductor equipment are also interested to hire Taiwanese engineers who have experience with tools designed by its rivals to help develop its own equipment in China.",tomshardware

For potential buyers, it's a mix of drivers that aren't fully baked and what we expect will be very limited amounts of stock. Behind the scenes, laptop manufacturers have seemingly been scrambling to get these things ready, with multiple delays.



The first reviews of Nvidia RTX 50-series laptop GPUs have been trickling out this week, with exclusive YouTube videos followed by limited reviews of the GPU as a component, and finally the laptop reviews today, squeezing into the end of a promised March launch window .

But with reviews live, I can tell you this: The Blackwell laptops don't feel totally ready. This is so much the case that we ran our Razer Blade 16 review (featuring an RTX 5090 Laptop GPU) without a score, warning readers to hold off until the drivers get better. Razer’s laptop had issues running two of our game benchmarks, and you shouldn't spend so much money on a system that we can't confidently say will run your games.

Granted, this also assumes you'll be able to get your hands on one.

Driver issues

In our testing, we found that the Blade 16 couldn't run Borderlands 3. Claptrap rolls around the screen as the shaders load, and then it crashes before it hits the main menu. Nvidia told me that the Borderlands problem was a known issue. (Though for some reason, it worked on the Gigabyte Aorus Master 16.)



Our other big issue was Red Dead Redemption, which would crash at the same point in every benchmark at 1080p. Nvidia suggested verifying the files to ensure the installation wasn't corrupted, but this didn't work for us. We tried fresh downloads of the game and even multiple launchers, but we couldn't get it to work. It was also suggested we try Vulkan over DX12, though DX12 was working at higher resolutions.



Most games that we tested did work. But we haven't had any systems in recent memory that had issues like this with more than one benchmark, and we expect that that is due to the current state of the Blackwell drivers. It's something we've also noticed with our desktop RTX 50-series testing, and it's enough to give us pause. A few updates will likely yield better results — we hope.

When are these launching?

Today's review date, plus some recent pre-orders opening (Alienware sent out a press release on Tuesday for the availability of the Alienware 18 Area 51 ), lets Nvidia plausibly say that it fulfilled its promise that these would be ""Available starting March 2025.""

(Image credit: Nvidia)

But it's unclear to me when you'll see a lot of them. I asked Razer multiple times when the Blade 16, which I was reviewing, would launch, but didn't get a response. As of this writing, Razer's website says it will ship April 30 as our review unit was configured (with a 5090), and April 14 with a 5080. A Razer representative told Tom's Hardware that ""The official on-sale date is March 31st. In terms of availability, that [April date] reflects the estimated status of our backlog. So if you are to order today, that is when you will are estimated to get one.""



That Alienware 18 Area-51? As of this writing, Dell's website is showing April 24 delivery dates. Lenovo has ship dates for the Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 in the second week of April, though that may shift depending on where you live.



Over at Newegg, the Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 has a March 31 release date, so you will theoretically be able to order that laptop in March. From what I'm told, though, inventory will be limited, and many of Gigabyte's other retail partners may not have stock that day.

I would love to know what RTX 5090 laptop is going to ship for $2,899. The Blade 16 starts at X with the 5090. (Image credit: Nvidia)

Those later release dates may be a good thing though, since the drivers need some work. Nvidia's engineers may have those fixes out by the time most systems might arrive in buyers' hands.

Confusion behind the scenes

Not to get too inside baseball, but the events we saw leading up to this launch don't give us a ton of confidence.

In time for the embargo, we received two systems: the Razer Blade 16 and the Gigabyte Aorus Master 16. (The latter didn't arrive in time for us to finish testing in time for the embargo. We plan to have our review up soon). But we were in talks about two more systems that were repeatedly delayed, often without an explanation.

Some sources suggested long before we ever got a machine that there had been multiple delays. We didn't expect these systems to be so in flux that we would be given different shipping dates three times. Another system was delayed into next month.



Typically, this doesn't affect you, the person who might buy these laptops. Like we said, it's inside baseball information. But what it shows is that these systems are coming in hot, and you should keep an eye out for updates on drivers to ensure everything is smooth.

Another stain on Blackwell

These issues follow what has been, at best, a tumultuous launch for Nvidia's RTX 50-series gaming GPUs . The desktop side has been rocky, with limited availability leading our GPU editor Jarred Walton to say that "" the current GPU landscape is a veritable wasteland, filled with scalpers and scam sellers."" (History repeats itself!) Nvidia made $130 billion last year , 89% of that from the data center unit, and it's clearly prioritizing Blackwell B200 and now Blackwell Ultra B300 production ahead of its consumer GPUs. That makes sense from a financial perspective, but it means consumer GPU prices and availability are hosed.

At launch, some RTX 5090, 5090D, and 5070 Ti desktop GPUs shipped with missing render output units, or ROPs , reducing performance due to production issues, which Nvidia says have been corrected and will not affect its laptop GPUs . The 5090, 5080, and 5070 Ti were also plagued by black screen issues and blue screens of death until they were resolved with a driver update — that was after we shipped back a ""malfunctioning"" 5090 to an AIB, only later to hear about a VBIOS update to fix the problems.

Even though these laptops are arriving a bit later than expected, the whole release still feels rushed. Perhaps, after a few driver updates, all of our games will work without issue. But as it stands, you should wait and make sure fixes get rolled out before splurging on any of these very expensive laptops. Again, that's assuming you can even find them in stock at reasonable prices — margins on mobile consumer GPUs aren't likely to be much higher than on the desktop RTX 50-series GPUs, so the chips are in the same boat relative to AI and data center production.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,"$3,700 RTX 5090 GPUs have found new homes after sitting on US retailer's shelves",https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/usd3-700-rtx-5090-gpus-have-found-new-homes-after-sitting-on-us-retailers-shelves,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 13:27:37 GMT","March 30 marks the two-month anniversary of the RTX 50-series GPU launch, yet Nvidia still has not managed to mitigate its apparent supply-chain concerns that have hampered inventory and street prices since day one. A Reddit user shared an image from Micro Center Dallas, where we can see the elusive RTX 5090, one of the best graphics cards, in stock. The catch is that you'll need to pay close to $4,000 to get your hands on one, assuming they haven't sold out yet. Spoiler: The comment section suggests they have, and we've verified the status on Micro Center's website.

It has seemingly become the norm for AIBs to increase already absurd prices after launch for GPUs that aren't even in stock. The argument is that these increases reflect the laws of supply and demand. Lack of supply leads to high prices, reducing demand until the market stabilizes. Nvidia governs the supply end of the spectrum and how much wafer allocation goes to consumer-grade GB20X chips, which likely don't sell as well as Blackwell B200/B300 AI accelerators for data centers.

The liquid-cooled ROG Astral LC GeForce RTX 5090 we're looking at launched with a price tag of $3,099.99, which is already 50% over Nvidia's recommended MSRP. It's understandable since it's a premium model with liquid cooling and all the bells and whistles. AIBs are free to price their non-MSRP models as they like, which isn't inherently bad. To the side, we can also spot several high-end ROG Astral RTX 5080s, with no budget TUF Gaming or Prime models in sight. At the far right, a price tag sticker attached to the ROG Astral RTX 5090 on the third shelf reveals that Micro Center is selling these units for $3,700, 20% over Asus' launch MSRP.

This is lower than what the average RTX 5090 Founders Edition goes for on eBay. Customers are willing to pay up to $4,000 or higher for a GPU that was initially supposed to cost $2,000 and isn't even all that faster versus its last-generation counterpart, the RTX 4090, considering the previous gen-on-gen uplifts we've seen. If you're a professional, you might as well consider Nvidia's Blackwell workstation GPUs.

This problem also extends to previous-generation RTX 40 series cards, most of which are likely no longer in production. Per our detailed analysis, the RTX 5090 is the worst GPU in terms of the price-to-performance ratio, taking into account eBay prices.

With a limited number of wafers available each month, the economy favors Nvidia's server and workstation GPUs, which generate significantly more revenue for the firm. Like their approach with Ampere, analysts suggest Nvidia could adopt a dual-sourcing strategy, using Intel's 18A wafers for gaming GPUs while reserving all TSMC supply for its data center offerings.",tomshardware

I bought these microphones with content creation in mind. The dual microphones are exceptionally useful for conducting interviews in the field. With noise cancellation the microphones capture just the voices of the myself and the interviewee and none of the background noise. Audio quality is clear and punchy.

The Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphones come with a kit bag full of extras. Lanyards to hold the microphone magnetically, wind muffs (also known as dead cats) to block wind noise, magnetic lapel clips, and weirdly some colorful stickers to hide the microphones. When not in use, the two microphones and the receiver are contained in a plastic case with onboard LiPo battery charging, just like Airpods. When you are done with them, throw them in the box and they charge ready for the next interview.

I primarily use the Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphone with my Windows 10 PC for meetings and for hosting The Pi Cast. But I have an issue. My PC only has only one USB Type-C port and it is on the back of the case! Armed with a trusty USB Type-C to A adapter I can plug the receiver into any spare USB port on my desktop and Windows 10 will instantly recognize and switch my audio input.

I genuinely love these microphones, they are much easier to use than clunky wired mics, and I can use them across many different devices without the need for drivers.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Intel's board gets industry-focused as three directors will not seek re-election — badly needed shift to deeper tech experience,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intels-board-gets-industry-focused-as-three-directors-will-not-seek-re-election-badly-needed-shift-to-deeper-tech-experience,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 11:21:32 GMT","Intel has announced that three members of its 14-person board of directors will not seek reelection at the 2025 annual meeting on May 5, reducing the board to 11, as observed by Reuters. Two out of three directors come from the healthcare industry, and their departure marks the board's shift to become a more high-tech industry-focused one, which may be a good thing for Lip-Bu Tan, Intel's new chief executive.

The departing directors are Dr. Omar Ishrak, who formerly led Medtronic and stepped down as Intel's chair in early 2023; Dr. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, a former University of Pennsylvania professor in population health and equity; and Dr. Tsu-Jae King Liu, a UC Berkeley engineering dean focused on microelectronics. Their exit follows the recent addition of Eric Meurice, ex-CEO of ASML, and Steve Sanghi, interim chief of Microchip Technology, in December.

This adjustment continues Intel's move away from its previous board composition, which used to include directors from academia, finance, healthcare, and PC industries. The current board includes five directors with finance, investment, or e-commerce backgrounds, two outgoing directors with healthcare ties, two from academia with a focus on electrical engineering and semiconductors, one from the personal computer sector, and three from the semiconductor industry.

The new board will lack directors from the healthcare industry and one from academia, but will have a stronger emphasis on industry-specific knowledge, which could be instrumental in supporting Intel's efforts to regain its competitive edge on products and process technology fronts.

""We are committed to having the right mix of skills, qualifications and technical expertise on the Board,"" wrote Frank D. Yeary, chairman of Intel with a background in finance, in a letter to shareholders. ""In 2024 we added Eric Meurice, former President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of ASML, and Steve Sanghi, Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer of Microchip, as independent directors. Eric and Steve are highly respected and accomplished leaders in the semiconductor industry whose deep technical expertise, executive experience, and operational rigor make them great additions to the Intel Board — and they have had an immediate impact. We are also pleased to have Lip-Bu once again serving on the Board.""",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,China's AI data center boom goes bust: Rush leaves billions of dollars in idle infrastructure,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/chinas-ai-data-center-boom-goes-bust-rush-leaves-billions-of-dollars-in-idle-infrastructure,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 10:26:03 GMT","Triggered by the rise of generative AI applications, China rapidly expanded its AI infrastructure in 2023 – 2024 and built hundreds of new data centers using both state and private funding. But this boom has since lost momentum. Facilities that cost billions of dollars now sit underused, returns are falling, and the market for GPU rentals has collapsed. To make the matters worse, many data centers became outdated before they were even fully operational as market conditions have changed, according to MIT Technology Review.

Rushed data centers do not earn money

The sudden drop in real estate activity following the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic increased pressure to find new economic drivers, and the rise of ChatGPT in late 2022 made AI seem like the next big thing. In 2023 alone, more than 500 data center projects were proposed nationwide, according to KZ Consulting. By late 2024, at least 150 projects were reportedly operational. Local authorities promoted these projects, hoping to boost their regional economies. State-owned companies, government-linked investment funds as well as private companies and investors were eager to back these data centers.

But as usually happens with rushed projects, poor planning were their downfall. For example, some facilities were often built without regard for actual demand or technical standards, according to MIT Technology Review's sources among project leads and executives. This is not particularly surprising as engineers with the relevant experience are rare, and many executives depended on middlemen who inflated projections or exploited procurement to get subsidies. As a consequence, many new data centers fell short of expectations as they are expensive to run, difficult to fill, and technically irrelevant for contemporary AI workloads.

To make the matters even more complicated, some projects never planned to profit from computation at all. According to multiple reports and industry insiders cited by MIT Technology Review, certain companies used AI data centers to qualify for government-subsidized green energy or land deals. In some cases, electricity earmarked for AI tasks was sold back into the grid for a mark-up. Others secured loans and tax incentives while leaving buildings unused. By late 2024, most people still in the business were aiming to benefit from policy incentives rather than actual AI work, the report claims.

The AI data center market is changing

When massive AI data centers were built in 2023 – 2024, the envisioned demand for AI training and AI inference performance requirements was different than the actual demand we see today.

Nowadays demand is shifting towards inference as this is what makes money for owners of AI models. Inference workloads do not necessarily require massive clusters based on tens of thousands of high-end Nvidia GPUs that are used for training. By contrast, inference workloads can benefit from specialized accelerators with lower cost and power consumption, but faster response times. As a result, monthly rental prices for an H100 server with eight GPUs designed for training have plummeted from ¥180,000 ($24,000) to ¥75,000 ($10,000). Interestingly, despite export restrictions, the H100 continues to flow steadily.

As a result, massive rural or inland locations are now far less attractive despite their lower costs. Consequently, some data centers now offer free computing vouchers to local tech firms, but still get underused. By contrast, other data center operators often shut down facilities entirely rather than risk losses from electricity and maintenance that partial rental income cannot cover.

One of the biggest shifts came with the rise of DeepSeek, which released a reasoning model called R1 that achieved performance comparable to ChatGPT o1 but at significantly lower cost. This made many AI companies rethink their requirements for hardware and scale.

Despite the setbacks, central authorities remain committed to AI development. A government symposium held in early 2025 reaffirmed the need for national self-reliance in this area. Major firms have followed suit: Alibaba announced over $50 billion in planned investments for cloud and AI infrastructure, and ByteDance committed another $20 billion.

Insiders believe Chinese officials will not abandon these projects, viewing them as growing pains rather than failures. The government is expected to take over floundering centers and assign them to more capable operators. However, for those operators that cannot rent their capacity to clients that can pay, the bubble has clearly gone bust.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Crucial Pro Overclocking DDR5-6400 C38 2x16GB Review: Deceitfully Fast,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ram/crucial-pro-overclocking-ddr5-6400-c38-2x16gb-review,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT","The Crucial Pro Overclocking DDR5-6400 C38 is a very solid memory kit that appeals to both Intel and AMD CPU owners. However, savvy shoppers should check for like-priced kits with lower timings.

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

The Crucial Pro Overclocking DDR5-6400 C38 represents a memory kit that can indeed challenge even the best RAM available on the retail market. Intel's latest Core Ultra 200S (codenamed Arrow Lake) processors are the first mainstream chips to support DDR5-6400 memory natively. This advancement has enabled memory manufacturers to produce and market fresh DDR5-6400 memory kits for Arrow Lake users. In Crucial's case, the company has already introduced its DDR5-6400 CUDIMMs to the market while concurrently releasing the Pro Overclocking variant that caters to the more demanding consumer.

Like all modern enthusiast-grade memory, the Pro Overclocking memory modules feature an aluminum anodized heat spreader. As always, Crucial offers two color options: matte black or matte white. Micron and Crucial branding are on both sides of the heat spreader, but it's not something that will make you lose sleep. You'll also find the traditional sticker with the specifications on one side, which is easily removable.

The Pro Overclocking memory modules feature a low-profile design that many users will appreciate. At 1.38 inches (35mm) tall, they will likely not get in the way of your air CPU cooler. Nonetheless, it's prudent to double-check if you're using a low-profile CPU cooler.

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Due to the resistant adhesive, removing the heat spreader was challenging. Piecing together the various little markings, the Crucial utilizes the 4SD75 D8GVH ICs, which are effectively the company's D-die chips. We're looking at a single-rank design and a single-sided layout with eight 2GB ICs on one side of the black PCB. We identified the power management IC (PMIC) to be the 0H=9J T3Q chip from Richtek.

If you leave the memory as it is, it'll natively run at DDR5-5600 with 46-45-45-90 timings. The Pro Overclocking comes with both Intel XMP 3.0 and AMD EXPO support. You receive two profiles. The primary DDR5-6400 profile is configured for 38-40-40-84, whereas the secondary DDR5-6000 profile has 36-38-38-80 timings. Both profiles require a 1.35V DRAM voltage. See our PC Memory 101 feature and How to Shop for RAM story for more timings and frequency considerations.

The Pro Overclocking memory kit exhibited powerful performance across different application workloads. Its notable highlights include Microsoft Office 2021, 7-Zip decompression, HandBrake conversion, and y-cruncher. However, the memory kit ranked in the middle of the pack concerning gaming performance.

AMD Performance

Crucial's memory kit continued to lead in application performance on the AMD X870 platform. It confidently showcased its prowess in benchmarks, including Adobe applications, Corona 12, HandBrake, and y-cruncher. In contrast to the Intel platform, the Pro Overclocking memory emerged as the top-performing kit for gaming on the AMD platform.

Overclocking and Latency Tuning

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Increasing the voltage from 1.35V to 1.45V enabled the Pro Overclocking to achieve DDR5-6733 from DDR5-6400, maintaining the exact 38-40-40-84 timings. The Crucial memory kit outperformed G.Skill's competing Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-6400 C32 in overclocking, although the latter features superior memory timings (32-39-39-102) at DDR5-6600.

Micron D-die ICs lag behind competitors in achieving low timings. Whereas quality SK hynix ICs can comfortably operate at a CAS Latency (CL) as low as 30 clock cycles, the Crucial memory modules remain inflexible. Despite the voltage bump from 1.35V to 1.45V, we could only decrease the tRCD and tRP by two clock cycles on the Pro Overclocking memory modules.

Bottom Line

New memory kits are launched daily, making it challenging to declare any one kit the fastest for good. However, during this review, the Crucial Pro Overclocking DDR5-6400 C38 stands out as the fastest DDR5-6400 memory kit we have tested. Its out-of-the-box performance is great, but there is limited room for overclocking, despite the inclusion of 'overclocking' in its name. To clarify, while Crucial's memory kit provides the top-tier performance you expect, there is little wiggle room to extract a vast amount of ""free performance"" from it.

With a $83.99 price tag, the Crucial Pro Overclocking DDR5-6400 C38 is typically one of those memory kits you could buy without hesitation. However, the DDR5-6400 category is crowded, and competing options within the same price range offer significantly better timings. While we haven't tested some of those memory kits, we can't ignore their existence. This doesn't mean Crucial's memory kit is egregiously overpriced; instead, it faces stiff competition.",tomshardware
https://zdnet.com,Google's Pixel 8 still holds up in 2025 - and it's an even better buy at its new price,https://zdnet.com/article/googles-pixel-8-still-holds-up-in-2025-and-its-an-even-better-buy-at-its-new-price/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Max Buondonno/ZDNET

ZDNET's key takeaways

Normally retailing for $699, the Pixel 8 offers a flagship-level experience with Google's latest AI and machine learning features.

With fast performance, amazing cameras, and Google's Actua display, it's one of the best smartphone deals available.

Compared to similarly priced phones, like the Nothing Phone 2, the Pixel 8 is a far better value.

As part of Amazon's 2025 Spring Sale, Google's base Pixel 8 in Obsidian (black) has received a 30% discount. Its price has dropped from $700 to just $487. Other color options, like the Pixel 8 in Hazel, are on sale too, although the price drop isn't as deep.

The Google Pixel 9 might be getting all the attention nowadays (especially with its access to Google's new Gemini AI model), but the standard Pixel 8 is still an impressive model among the rest of Google's smartphone catalog.

Also: I picked the 160+ best deals for Amazon's Spring Sale

That's because the Pixel 8 offers one of the best combinations of specs, features, and premium design at a price considerably lower than the competition. Even at full price, the device is cheaper than contemporaries like the Galaxy S24 ($760) and the OnePlus 12 (which normally retails for $900).

Because it balances performance and cost so well, the Pixel 8 is difficult to ignore and perhaps the only phone you should consider if you're shopping on a budget. You won't find another phone like it under $500, and it's only when you sift through the $800-$1,000 options that you find commendable competition.

A big reason why this is such a compelling option is the Tensor G3 chip, Google's latest in-house processor that powers all of the Pixel 8's AI and machine learning features. It's not just a solid Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 alternative but a monumental reason why the Pixel 8 is such a great phone.

Also: Grab the Samsung Galaxy S25 for as low as $700 at Amazon

The chip powers all the Google Pixel-ness of the Pixel 8, from transcribing voices in the Recorder app to letting you edit photos to your heart's content with the AI-powered Magic Editor. The Google Assistant also takes advantage of the G3 to process your voice quicker and even summarize web pages for quickly consuming information. Alongside powering Google's HDR pipeline for photography and ensuring Android 14 is slick and smooth, the G3 is one of the most capable smartphone chips on the market. And when paired with 8GB of RAM, you'll never have a slow day.

Max Buondonno/ZDNET

The display is another huge reason to get this phone. The Pixel 8's 6.2-inch Actua display is a bit smaller than the screen on the Pixel 7, but that makes it easier to hold in one hand. It's also stunning to look at; with a Full HD+ resolution, a 120Hz refresh rate, and 2,000 nits of peak brightness, it's one of the brightest and clearest displays on the market. Plus, it's OLED, so colors are vibrant, and inky blacks are plentiful.

Look beyond the display, and you'll find a good-looking phone crafted out of aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus. Featuring Google's signature camera bar on the back and thin bezels around the display, the Pixel 8 is a stunner among other sub-$500 phones. It's also IP68-certified for dust and water resistance, and it comes in three nice finishes: Obsidian (black), Hazel (kinda green), and Rose (more of a golden peach, in my opinion).

Max Buondonno/ZDNET

When it comes to Pixel phones, there are two areas you have to talk about: cameras and software.

On the camera front, Google knocked it out of the park. The rear 50MP main shooter and 12MP ultra-wide are both excellent performers in broad daylight and at night. The cameras easily match or outpace what you'd get with an iPhone 15 Pro or Galaxy S23 Ultra in terms of clarity, detail, and sharpness, while colors are often far more accurate than they ever have been on a Pixel phone.

Also: This midrange Galaxy phone can make you forget ever wanting a flagship - and it's on sale

You also get all of the camera chops that the Pixel name carries like astrophotography, Super ResZoom, dual exposure controls, and Ultra HDR. That's on top of other features like Best Take and Magic Editor that make these cameras the smartest you'll find. Plus, video quality has been vastly improved over previous Pixels -- it's flat-out comparable to the iPhone.

On the software side, Google's Pixel experience atop Android 14 remains my favorite way to interact with Android. It's clean and minimal and gives you a warm, inviting feeling that no other Android skin can mimic. You get all the features of Android 14, like customizable lock screens, better security, larger fonts, and improved notifications, along with all of the Pixel features you could ask for, such as Call Screen, Now Playing, Direct My Call, AI-generated wallpapers, and -- of course --the Pixel Launcher.

Max Buondonno/ZDNET

But the real kicker in the software department is Google's extended support. The company guarantees seven full years of software support, which means you'll get updates until 2030 if you buy this phone. That's unheard of for an Android phone, and it gives devices like the iPhone a run for their money.

Also: Google's latest Pixel phone is so close to being my perfect budget phone - here's why

Thanks to the 4,575mAh cell inside, the Pixel 8 can also last all day on a charge. With my medium to heavy usage, I typically end days with 30-40% in the tank, which means anyone using the phone a bit less could stretch it out to last a day and a half. Plus, you get 30W fast charging to juice back up and Qi wireless charging.

So, what are the downsides? Honestly, there aren't a lot. The Pixel 8 still gets pretty warm after being used for a while, but that's typical with Google's Tensor processors. I also wish there was a proper telephoto camera on the back; Super Res Zoom is handy for upscaling digitally zoomed photos, but it can only take you so far. Oh, and I still don't trust Face Unlock; Google lets you use it to pay for things now using Google Pay, but it still relies on a flat image of your face to authenticate you.

ZDNET's buying advice

You're not going to find a much better value than the Pixel 8 - especially at such a deep discount. From the gorgeous display and design to the speedy performance and amazing cameras, Google's standard flagship phone stands on its own with an impeccable balance of high-end features for a lower price than other flagships.

Also: This unique Android phone is a solid alternative to the flagships - especially at this price

With its sale price of $487, the closest competition happens to be the Galaxy A35 5G and Nothing Phone (2), two devices that are perfectly worthy of a spot in your pocket but don't offer the same value as the Pixel 8. Google's phone is a proper flagship with seven years of software support, the latest AI features, and the company's latest camera tricks.

Anyone shopping for an Android phone under $500 should consider the Pixel 8. Its value is simply incredible, and it's still a formidable device in 2025.

Microsoft 最高経営責任者のSatya Nadella氏 Microsoft 最高経営責任者のSatya Nadella氏

Microsoftは、2025年に創業50周年を迎える。講演の冒頭でNadella氏は、「Microsoftにとって日本は本質的に重要な存在であり続けている」と切り出し、顧客、パートナーを含む「全ての皆さまに感謝を申し上げたい」と述べた。また、クライアント／サーバー、クラウド、そして現在のAIと、コンピューティングプラットフォームトレンドが大きく変遷する中でも日本の位置付けは同様だと話した。

同社は、2024年4月に日本を対象としてAIおよびデータセンターなどで2900億ドル規模の投資を行うと表明した。「Microsoft Research Asia Tokyo」の開設など既に幾つもの施策を実行しており、Nadella氏はこの投資に基づく取り組みを引き続き進めていくなどと説明。今回のイベントに合わせて新たに、4月中旬から「Microsoft Azure」データセンターの東日本／西日本リージョンでNVIDIA製GPUを含む「Azureハイパフォーマンスコンピューティング」（Azure HPC）を提供することを発表。国内企業・組織がAI処理を含むより高度な計算機資源サービスを利用できるようになるとアピールした。

AIのトレンドが生成AIやAIエージェントへと変化する中で、Nadella氏はAIエージェントが個人や企業・組織の生産的な活動に貢献する「エージェンティックな時代が到来しており、このテクノロジーにより世界のあらゆる個人や企業・組織をエンパワーさせるという（Microsoftの）ミッションの実現にフォーカスしている」と述べ、生成AIとAIエージェントが個人の生活から企業・組織のあらゆるビジネスの在り方や体験といったものを変革させていくとした。

ここで同社は、生成AIプラットフォームの「Copilot」「Copilot＆AI stack」「Copilot devices」の3つのプラットフォームアプローチを取っているとした。

まずCopilotは、AIのためのユーザーインターフェース（UI）になり、Nadella氏は日常的な利用やその体験が世界的に広がりつつあると強調。日本でも日経平均株価構成銘柄の「日経225」企業の85％がCopilotを導入済みだとも述べた。AIエージェントに高度で複雑なタスクを実行させる上でもCopilotは、UIとして大きな役割を担うとする。

また、Copilotアプリケーション基盤の「Copilot Studio」でもAIエージェントの作成、構築、運用管理などの機能を拡充し、大規模なAIエージェントの協働環境を実現可能とする。プラットフォームとしてのCopilotは、その“原動力”となるデータをMicrosoftの各種アプリケーションやサービスあるいはコネクターを介したサードパーティーのデータとも接続される。講演の舞台上でNadella氏は、米国時間25日に発表したばかりの新たなAIエージェントの「Researcher」と「Analyst」も披露して見せた。

Copilot＆AI stackは、世界で展開する300以上のデータセンターの60以上のリージョンが根幹であり、Nadella氏は、シリコンレベル（半導体）からソフトウェアに至る広範なインフラ領域での投資と最適化によって、顧客に対する高性能なサービスと優れたコスト効率の価値を提供しているなどと説明。データ領域ではMicrosoftの各種データベースサービスや「Oracle Database」「Snowflake」などのエコシステムからなるプラットフォームがあり、AIアプリケーション領域では、1800以上の言語モデルとも接続可能な「Azure AI Foundry」を展開している。AIを活用するツール類も重要であり、例えば、開発プラットフォームの「GitHub」は、日本のユーザーが前年比23％増の355万人に到達したという。

Copilot devicesは、Copilot機能を容易に活用できるPCの「Copilot PC」といったデバイス領域になる。具体的にどのような製品が展開されているのかは未知数だが、Nadella氏はオフライン環境における高度なAI利用といった姿を提示した。ここでの実例が日本航空（JAL）の取り組みになる。

JALでは、航空機に搭乗する客室乗務員のレポート作成の負荷を低減するためにAIの活用を実証。レポート作成を支援するAIアプリケーションや小規模言語モデル（SLM）を開発し、ファインチューニングを重ねて正確性を向上させ、例えば、到着直後のレポート作成に要する時間を従前の40～50分から20分程度に短縮した。Nadella氏は、将来にこのようなことを航空機に搭載可能なデバイスで実現できるだろうとした。

最後にNadella氏は、AI時代では「信頼」の構築が大前提になると述べ、製品やサービスの構想段階から安全性を確立していく「セキュリティバイデザイン」をはじめとして、Microsoftのあらゆる取り組みでセキュリティを最優先に位置付けていると説明した。AIをセキュリティに活用する施策も拡大し、米国時間24日には「Security Copilot」の新機能として、サードパーティー連携を含む11種類のセキュリティAIエージェント群を発表している。

基調講演の後半では、日本マイクロソフト 代表取締役 社長の津坂美樹氏が司会役となり、顧客のAI事例として第一生命保険 代表取締役社長の隅野俊亮氏、ソフトバンク 専務執行役員の藤長国浩氏、東京都副都知事の宮坂学氏が取り組みを紹介した。

第一生命保険の隅野氏は、同社のAI活用の目的を業務効率化だけでなくビジネス価値の拡大などに置いているとし、生成AI関連で約50件のプロジェクトを展開中だという。営業担当者と保険代理店とのコミュニケーション活性化や提案力強化など多くの業務をAIが支援するシステムを開発中で、2026年4月の提供開始を目指しているとした。

ソフトバンクの藤長氏は、法人顧客への営業提案など多彩な業務でAIを活用中だと説明。生成AI／AIエージェントによる顧客対応でも高い顧客満足度を獲得しているし、個人契約者に対応するコールセンターでは約6000席のオペレーターブースを8割削減できるとした。

東京都の宮坂氏は、都庁全職員の業務基盤が「Microsoft 365」に移行し、AIで多くの業務効率化を図ることができるとコメント。例えば、ウェブや電話などで寄せられる毎日数万件規模で“都民の声”をAIで集約、分類することにより、都職員がより都民に寄り添えるようになったほか、Azureには都とのAI開発環境を内製により構築中。都下62区市町村が共同利用でき、自治体ごとに単独開発するような無駄をなくして、各自治体の成果を共有、活用できるようにしていくという。

津坂氏は、同社の日本でのAI関連投資を継続していると述べ、サイバーセキュリティ分野でのAI利用の知識とスキルを育成する新プログラム「CyberSmart AI」を同日から無償提供することも明らかにした。これは日本独自に開発したものといい、今国会で法制化審議中の能動的サイバー防御に関連して、政府機関と基幹インフラ事業者、公営企業などを対象としている。最新のサイバーセキュリティにおける攻撃と防御、サイバーレジリエンスとセキュリティオペレーションにおけるAI活用を体系的に習得できるとしている。",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,"""Linux 6.14"" officially released -- L. Torvals explains delay in release",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231044/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 06:30:00 GMT","締め切りに遅れる人間が自分以外にもいることを知って安心した。Linus Torvalds氏は次のように告白した。「3月23日、通常の日曜日午後のリリーススケジュールに沿って6.14をリリースしなかった理由について、説得力のある言い訳があるといいのだが、実際には、弁解の余地はない。単に私が無能だっただけだ。23日のリリースの間際になって何かが起きたわけでは決してない。私はマージウィンドウに備えるために、今回のリリースとは無関係な作業を処理していた。その過程で、6.14を実際にリリースすることを完全に忘れてしまっていた」

多少の遅れはあったが、「Linux 6.14」には、「Ubuntu 25.04」や「Fedora 42」など、間もなく登場予定のLinuxディストリビューションを強化する最先端の機能と改善が多数含まれている。

デスクトップユーザーにとってのビッグニュースは、改善された「NTSYNC」ドライバーである。Linuxで「Windows」ゲームをプレイしたり、「Windows」プログラムを実行したりしたいユーザーにとっては、特に重要な機能だ。このドライバーは、「Windows NT」の同期プリミティブをエミュレートするように設計されている。この機能によって、「Wine」や「Steam Play」で実行されるWindowsプログラムのパフォーマンスが大幅に向上する、ということを知っておけば大丈夫だろう。

Linuxゲーマーはこのリリースを心待ちにしていた。「YouTube」にLinux関連の動画を投稿しているGardiner Bryant氏は、「NTSYNCによって、Linuxのゲームは永遠に変わるだろう」と宣言した。Redditでは、ある投稿者が次のように述べた。「NTSYNCはすべての要件を満たしている。高速性、ポータビリティー、強力な性能、正確性を備えている。正確性は、『futex/futex2』インターフェースの応急処置や繰り返しを試みるのではなく、Windows風の同期セマンティクスをカーネルモジュールに実装することで実現された」

ゲーマーは常に最高のグラフィックスパフォーマンスを求めるので、Linuxが先ごろ発売されたAdvanced Micro Devices（AMD）の「RDNA 4」グラフィックスカードのサポートを追加したことも歓迎するはずだ。このアプローチには、AMDの「Radeon RX 9070 XT」および「Radeon RX 9070」グラフィックスカードのサポートが含まれる。このサポートと先ごろ改善されたオープンソースの「RADV」ドライバーの相乗効果により、AMDゲーマーはゲームをプレイするマシンで過去最高の速度を体験できるはずだ。

もちろん、このリリースはゲーマーだけを対象としているわけではない。Linux 6.14には、AMDとIntelのプロセッサー関連の機能強化もいくつか含まれている。例えば、電力管理、熱制御、コンピューティングパフォーマンスの最適化などの機能強化が施されている。これらのアップデートにより、システム全体の効率とパフォーマンスが向上するはずだ。

このリリースには、「AMD XDNA」ドライバーも含まれている。このドライバーは、「XDNA」アーキテクチャーをベースとするAMDのNPUの公式サポートを提供する。これにより、サポート対象のAMDハードウェア上で直接、畳み込みニューラルネットワーク（CNN）や大規模言語モデル（LLM）などのAIワークロードを効率的に実行することが可能になる。

「Rust」はこの数カ月、Linuxでいくつかの問題に直面しているが、Linux 6.14では、Rustプログラミング言語の抽象化がさらに進んでおり、Rustで記述されたドライバーを提供する準備が整った。Linuxの安定版カーネルのメンテナーであるGreg Kroah-Hartman氏は先ごろ、次のように述べた。「RustのさまざまなドライバーバインディングとRustのその他の変更により、さまざまなドライバーが実際に可能になった。これが転換点になると思う。これらのバインディングが登場したことで、今後、さらに多くのRustドライバーが登場するだろう」

ドライバーのほかにも、「Rust for Linux」の主任開発者のMiguel Ojeda氏は先ごろ、「Rust 1.84: derive」（「CoercePointee」）でスマートポインターのマクロが導入されたことについて、「安定したRust関数のみを使用するカーネルの構築プロセスにおける重要なマイルストーン」だと述べた。このアプローチにより、「C」とRustのコードの統合も容易になる。われわれは、RustのLinuxへの移植という目標にかなり近づいている。

さらに、Linux 6.14はQualcommの最新の「Snapdragon 8 Elite」モバイルプロセッサーもサポートしており、このチップセットを搭載したデバイスのパフォーマンスと安定性が向上している。このサポートにより、2025年中に極めて高速な「Android」ベースのスマートフォンが登場するはずだ。

Linux 6.14には、いわゆる「GhostWrite」脆弱（ぜいじゃく）性を修正するパッチが含まれている。この脆弱性が悪用されると、一部の「RISC-V」プロセッサーがルート化されるおそれがある。今回の修正により、そのような攻撃がブロックされる。

さらに、Linux 6.14には、コピーオンライトの「Btrfs」ファイルシステム／論理ボリュームマネージャーの改善も含まれている。これらの読み取り分散方法は、さまざまなRAIDハードウェアの構成とワークロードに柔軟性を提供する。さらに、キャッシュされていないバッファーI/Oのサポートにより、高速ストレージデバイスを備えたシステムでのメモリー使用が最適化される。

簡潔に言うと、Linux 6.14はLinuxの進化における大きな前進であり、ゲーム愛好家からAI研究者、開発者まで、さまざまなユーザーのニーズに対応した強力な機能セットを提供する。リリースが少し遅れたとはいえ、Linux 6.14のさまざまな機能強化のおかげで、多用途で先進的なプラットフォームとしてのLinuxの地位はより強固になった。

Linux 6.14を試してみたい人は、今すぐ実行に移すことが可能だ。Linux 6.14はすでにダウンロード公開されている。Torvalds氏によると、「保留中のプルリクエストが山積している」ので、「Linux 6.15」にはさらに多くの変更が施される見通しだという。",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,Device updates and data utilization help to further use GIGA devices,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231040/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 07:30:00 GMT","2019年12月に文部科学省が発表した「GIGAスクール構想」から約5年がたち、各自治体や教育事業を展開する企業は「GIGAスクール構想 第2期（NEXT GIGA）」に向けた取り組みを始めている。本稿では、更新が迫る情報端末と、NEXT GIGAで注目されるデータ活用について取り上げたい。

まずGIGAスクール構想の意義を改めて確認すると、1人1台の情報端末と高速大容量の通信ネットワークを全国の小・中学校に整備すること、そして多様な子どもたちを誰一人取り残すことなく、個別最適化され、資質・能力が一層確実に育成できる教育ICT環境を実現することを目的にしている。

2月に開催された「教育DX推進フォーラム」で文部科学省 初等中等教育局 学校情報基盤・教材課長の寺島史朗氏は、GIGAスクール構想で浮かび上がった課題として、「ICT活用の学校間・自治体間の格差」「通信ネットワーク速度」「校務DX」――の3点を挙げている（関連記事）。NEXT GIGAではこの課題を解消しつつ、学校のICT環境の更新や端末のさらなる活用の促進が求められている。

2019年から児童・生徒に対して1人1台端末が整備され、早い自治体では2024年度から端末の更新が始まっている。2025～2026年にかけては約950万台の端末更新が予定されているという。NEXT GIGAでは都道府県単位での共同調達が進む中、複数の自治体では独自の教育を展開するために市区町村単体での調達をするケースも少なくない。

各社、NEXT GIGAに向けた新たな端末を展開しているが、ここではNECとレノボの新モデルにフォーカスしたい。両社で共通しているのは、「堅牢（けんろう）性・耐久性の強化」だ。端末の故障理由としてさまざまなことが挙げられるが、机や持ち運び時の落下による破損、USBポートに鉛筆を挿すことによる発煙など、児童ならではの理由が多く挙げられた。

NECが提供する学習者用端末の新モデル「NEC Chromebook Y4」では、マザーボードからの電源供給を不要とする回路にするためサブボードの設計を変更し、ショートが起きにくく、発火・発煙に結び付きにくい基盤を設計。また、全ての電源供給ケーブルに保護回路を追加し、発火・発煙の発現を低下しているという。

開口部への鉛筆や消しゴムなどの異物差し込み対策としては、開口部を極力減らし、左側面に集約した。加えて、机上の鉛筆を滑らせても開口部に入らない高さにし、発煙防止対策を徹底している（関連記事）。

他方、レノボはハードウェアと各種ソリューションを統合したパッケージ「Lenovo GIGA School Edition」をNEXT GIGAに向けに提供する。同パッケージ内で提供される端末は、米国国防総省の調達基準「MIL規格」に準拠するほか、レノボ独自の教育向け製品用の堅牢性基準を満たすテスト「Lenovo DuraSpec」を実施し、耐久性を検証。76cmの高さからコンクリートまたはスチール板に落下させるテストや、ねじり試験、圧力試験などを行い、端末に破損がないか、全ての機能が動作するかを確認している。

また、ICT活用の格差に対しては「教員が使わせたくなる、生徒が使いたくなるような端末作り」をコンセプトに、利便性を向上させるペンシルタッチ機能と活用を促進する無料ソリューションサービスを用意した。ペンシルタッチ機能では、普段から児童・生徒が利用している鉛筆をタッチペン代わりに使えるようにしている。鉛筆削りで書き心地を調整でき、2B以上の軟らかさの鉛筆に対応する（関連記事）。

各端末の詳細なスペックは関連記事をご覧いただきたいが、両社ともに“壊れにくさ”を重視した端末の設計に尽力したことがうかがえる。他方、筆者が教育現場に足を運んだ際に印象的だったのが、授業中に端末の電池が切れてしまい、充電器がある棚の上で充電しながら端末を利用している生徒の姿だ。これは高校で見た風景だったので、小・中学校に当てはまるかは分からないが、今後デジタル教科書が普及する中で授業中に端末を使えない状況になるのは致命的だ。教室内だけで端末を利用するとも限らない。改良を重ねた新たな端末が、NEXT GIGAではどのように使われていくのか注目していきたい。",zdnet

Hayashi Akiko, head of Compute Products Headquarters, Digital Sales and Compute Business Division, explained the details.

In security, the dedicated security processor ""Secure Enclave"" was newly incorporated into the operation management processor ""HPE iLO 7"". Secure Enclave ""acts as an independent security processor, as a vault for cryptographic machines, passwords, security configurations, firmware, etc., and serves as a new layer of defense to protect the system from tampering and attacks."" The ProLiant server product equipped with iLO 7 with Secure Enclave is based on the iLO 7 and meets the requirements for FIPS 140-3 Level 3 authentication and is positioned as a ""quantum-resistant cryptography-compatible server.""

In terms of performance and power efficiency, compared to the Gen10, which was released in 2017, two generations ago, it is said that it is possible to consolidate 7:1, and by implementing this consolidation, it is possible to reduce electricity costs by 65%. Given the current situation where high-load workloads such as AI-related workloads are increasing, Gen12 has now available Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC), which the company has accumulated a wealth of experience in the HPC field for many years, and ""supports DLC on all 1-/2-socket Intel-based Gen12 rack servers,"" allowing you to choose between air-cooling or liquid-cooling if necessary. The water-cooling shift in data centers is likely to accelerate.

In automation, the cloud-based management tool ""HPE Compute Ops Management"" (COM) has been enhanced with AI. By collecting information on server usage and power status and predicting future energy costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using AI, it can contribute to achieving sustainability goals and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,Google makes Android development process private -- What information can no longer be confirmed?,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231098/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 16:00:00 GMT","Google plans to privately develop the Android OS for mobile devices, so people outside the company will no longer be able to see the development process. This change is a major shift for Android, which has shown behind the scenes of development to developers and everyone, among others.

However, the average user should not feel any impact. Explain the changes, their background and expected impacts.

What will change with Android?

Up until now, Google has developed Android mainly in two branches. One is an internal branch, and the other is a public branch called the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). With AOSP, anyone could make a contribution to checking Android development status and improving it, but behind the scenes, Google's internal team did most of the work. AOSP tends to have a slower development pace than internal branches, and it took developers to check for new features and updates.

Google has officially announced that it will migrate all Android development to Android Authority, which publishes Android-related news, to internal branches. Completed Android versions will continue to be provided on the public branch, but update information will not be shared until the official release is ready. This is expected to help Google streamline its development process and avoid the problems that arise when attempting to integrate separate branches.

Google's aim

The main reason for this change in policy is the efficiency of Android development. Google currently takes a lot of time and effort to integrate public AOSP code with private code. By integrating it into a single branch, the company aims to speed up development and reduce potential mistakes. This change does not mean closing saucer Android. Google will provide the source code as soon as a new version of Android is ready. This simply means that progress will no longer be shared in real time as before.

Do users feel an impact?

You probably won't feel it. For most Android users, this change does not affect daily use. The impact of Android updates on smartphones remains the same, and applications will be developed and updated as before. The real change is that Android enthusiasts and developers will no longer be able to easily view the development process, at least until new updates are ready to be delivered.

The most affected are developers and technical reporters. Developers who build custom ROMs or work with AOSP may find it difficult to follow the evolution as they will no longer be able to track development in detail. It would be a shame for technical reporters to no longer be able to get leaks of pre-publication information from AOSP. This leak is often hinting at the next generation of features and devices. For example, recently, the leak that the Pixel 10 was introduced in the AOSP code gave us a glimpse into Google's future plans.

When will this change be implemented?

The change is scheduled to take place from the week of March 30th, and the official announcement from Google is expected to be in the second half of the week of the 23rd. From then on, all Android development will be private and will only be made public when the source code is provided.",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,"Security threats change even further, including the spread of attacks targeting SaaS--Cloud Strike",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231100/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 14:36:00 GMT","クラウドストライクは3月28日、2025年版グローバル脅威レポートを公開し、メディア向けに解説を行った。同社が監視する脅威アクターがさらに増加し、SaaSへの攻撃拡大や手法の高度化などの変化もより進んでいる状況だと指摘している。

このレポートは、2024年における同社の脅威インテリジェンスから判明したセキュリティ脅威の動向をとりまとめたもの。解説を担当したファルコン コンプリート マネージャーの鵜沢裕一氏は、「脅威アクターの年だったと言える」と総括した。

脅威アクターとは、サイバー攻撃やサイバー犯罪を行う人間や組織などの総称。鵜沢氏は、アクターには、国家の支援を受けて機密情報の窃取などを狙うタイプ、金銭の獲得を狙うタイプ、主義・主張を知らしめることを目的にする「ハクティビスト」の3種類があると解説。企業や組織のセキュリティ対策では、個々の攻撃を防ぐことに主眼を置きがちだが、鵜沢氏は、自組織を狙う脅威アクターのタイプ、動機、目的にも目を向けるべきと説いた。



クラウドストライク ファルコン コンプリート マネージャーの鵜沢裕一氏 クラウドストライク ファルコン コンプリート マネージャーの鵜沢裕一氏

クラウドストライクは長期にわたり脅威アクターの活動を追跡しているといい、2024年の対象アクター数は26件増の257件、さらに脅威アクターとなる恐れのある集団が140件あるとした。

また、同社が分析した2024年の全体的な脅威動向では、音声を使うフィッシング攻撃の「Vishing（Voice Phishing）」が442％増、初期段階の不正侵入に特化したアクターの「アクセスブローカー」が50％増となり、攻撃全体のうち初期段階の不正侵入で悪用された脆弱（ぜいじゃく）性が52％を占めた。不正侵入に成功した脅威アクターが侵害を拡大する「ラテラルムーブメント（横展開）」を開始するまでの時間も近年は数十分単位で短くなっており、2024年同社が検知した最速のケースは51秒だったという。

人間をだますフィッシング攻撃は、技術的なサイバーセキュリティの防御を講じることが難しい人の心理につけ込むため、脅威アクターが多用する「ソーシャルエンジニアリング」と呼ばれる手法の一つになる。

例えば、同社が2024年に遮断した「Curly Spider」と呼ぶ脅威アクターの攻撃では、標的に膨大なスパムメールを送り付けて、その対応で標的を疲弊させる。次にアクターは、その状態の標的に「ITサポート」のVishingで接近し、標的を巧妙な攻撃サイトにアクセスさせて、標的の認証情報を窃取する。脅威アクターは、この認証情報を使って初期侵入し、正規のITツールを悪用して侵入先のシステムに不正プログラムを設置したり設定を変更したりするなどして、永続的に侵入可能な状態にしようとした。ただし、この攻撃は検知から4分未満で阻止されたという。



「Curly Spider」によるソーシャルエンジニアリングから不正侵入を狙った攻撃の流れ（出典：クラウドストライク） 「Curly Spider」によるソーシャルエンジニアリングから不正侵入を狙った攻撃の流れ（出典：クラウドストライク）

このほかに鵜沢氏は、2024年の特徴的な脅威動向として、クラウドの侵害、脆弱性攻撃、SaaSへの攻撃を挙げた。

クラウドの侵害は25％増加し、このうち有効な認証情報が悪用されたケースが35％を占めた。クラウドを侵害する脅威アクターは、侵入先のクラウド環境の悪用にとどまらず、昨今ではクラウド上の大規模言語モデル（LLM）も悪用し始めているという。特に中国と北朝鮮の支援を受ける脅威アクターが増加しているとした。

脆弱性攻撃では、特に日常的に厳格な監視が難しく、ファームウェアの積極的な更新などが行われていないネットワーク通信機器が狙われているとのこと。また、脆弱性対策では、危険度や重要度が高いものに優先して対応することがセオリーとされてきたが、鵜沢氏は「異なる低レベルの脆弱性を組み合わせて悪用の成功率を高める『チェーンエクスプロイト』が拡大している」と警鐘を鳴らす。

SaaSへの攻撃では、「Microsoft 365」が頻繁に狙われているといい、全体のうち「Microsoft SharePoint」の侵害が22％、「Outlook」の侵害が17％を占めていた。上述のフィッシング攻撃などで脅威アクターに窃取された認証情報が悪用されており、鵜沢氏は多要素認証の強化と設定不備の修正の徹底などが肝心とアドバイスした。

これら以外にも2024年は、生成AIによる精巧なフィッシングメールやディープフェーク（偽動画）の攻撃も目立つようになり、中国を背景とする脅威アクターの能力がほかの大国と並ぶほどに到達し、同国の地政学的な野心をかなえる攻撃が活発になっているとした。中国を背景とするさまざまな脅威アクターは、標的の国・地域、業界別で特化している傾向が見られるという。

最後に鵜沢氏は、脅威対策では認証情報などのアイデンティティーやクラウドの保護の重要性が高まり、オンプレミスやクラウドの異なる環境を横断した脅威への対応が必要だとし、今後は自組織を狙う脅威アクターの正体を理解しての対策も求められると話した。",zdnet

NEC and Kyodo Shoji Coed Brewery (Coed Brewery, Kawagoe City, Saitama Prefecture) announced on March 28th that NEC's ""Agentic AI"" has devised and developed a craft beer called ""Yami Brewery."" Using AI, four types of craft beer have been jointly developed that express the characteristics and values ​​of each generation in their 20s and 50s, and is positioned as ""AI craft beer that allows you to experience the lives that four generations have passed.""

Pre-orders for Seikabushi Craft will begin on April 1st at the official Coed Brewery online store, and will be shipped sequentially from June 5th. The price of a set of 4 bottles including tax is 1,980 yen. They prepare 2,000 sets for the first lot, and will rebrew them after seeing the reaction.

Agentic AI uses NEC's own large-scale language model (LLM) cotomi, and this time it will support beer development. Cotomi analyzed modern Japanese people, created personas for each generation, understood the target customers, and created recipe proposals based on recipe information and other information. Simply enter the image of the beer you are developing at the prompt and you will automatically perform the work to this extent.

At the prompt, he was able to obtain a recipe proposal by entering the following: ""Imagine a Japanese person in his 20s, and using recipe information from both inside and outside the company as a reference, creating a new craft beer recipe."" Furthermore, AI and the beer craftsman discussed the recipe proposal on the chat screen, and added these opinions to the final completion.

Asagiri Shigeharu, CEO of Coed Brewery, said, ""It feels like craftsmen and AI are at the opposite ends, but I thought that an environment where people can work together rather than conflicts will be created. In the past, we have been able to receive more awards from the collective knowledge of craftsmen, but with Agentic AI, it seems like one new team member has added more skilled. They have made new proposals for making beer, and craftsmen can hit the walls. This is probably the first time that AI and beer craftsmen have co-created. By quantifying and analyzing them, we will also work to ensure that people can drink with peace of mind.""

Chiba Yuki, Head of Business Development, NEC Generation AI, said, ""NEC's AI has the ability to cleverly and efficiently disassemble operations against vague instructions as a unique feature. We are proud to be suitable for realizing Agent AI, which can handle advanced specialized tasks and complex business processes. It can evolve from being a tool to being trusted and entrusted to ""buddy.""",zdnet

Please see the related article for details of the press conference, and here we will focus on Furuichi's opening remarks.

He explained the following while showing Figure 1:



(Figure 1) The concept of the Agent System of Record (ASOR) (Source: Workday press conference material) (Figure 1) The concept of the Agent System of Record (ASOR) (Source: Workday press conference material)

""The Workday platform is used by approximately 70 million users, with approximately 1 trillion transactions moving annually. This is the amount of data accumulated to our company's strength in leveraging AI. By leveraging this data, we currently have eight AI agents listed at the bottom of the diagram.""

""And the newest new product was ASOR. It is a solution that uses the know-how we have cultivated in human resource management to AI agents. There are three patterns of AI agents: not only what we provide, but what our customers have developed themselves, and what other vendors offer, so there are concerns that these will become increasingly common within companies in the future. Furthermore, in managing these, security, governance, and compliance will become essential. ASOR is trying to meet these needs and enable the management of employees and AI agents in the company to centrally manage employees and AI agents.""

ASOR is scheduled to be available from the second half of 2025, and it will be a little while before we can see people centrally managing a wide variety of AI agents, but on the other hand, this may be in line with the timing of increasing demand for many companies.

Regarding ASOR, please refer to the article ""How to manage and utilize a wide variety of AI agents - Exploring Workday's initiatives"" published on March 19th in another series by the author on this site, ""A Word of Saying,"" which explains the background and significance.

To put it another way, ASOR is an evolution of the Workday platform so far. As Furuichi says, as companies are concerned about the uproaring number of AI agents, the need for solutions like ASOR will undoubtedly increase. We'll be looking forward to seeing if the company can become a person who will spark that movement.",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,Kirishima Sake Brewery realizes on-site application development using FileMaker and iPad,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231074/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 10:23:00 GMT","Kirishima Sake Brewery (Miyazaki Prefecture), known for its sweet potato shochu ""Kuro Kirishima"", is using the low-code development platform ""Claris FileMaker"" and ""iPad"" to in-house app development under the leadership of the site. Claris International announced it on March 27th.

The amount of shochu shark produced during the process of making shochu is approximately 800 tons per day. The recycling plant undergoes machinery maintenance 2-4 times a week. Previously, inspection records were managed on a handwritten paper basis, and data entered at the site was transferred to spreadsheet software at the office. In addition, photos taken with a digital camera must be saved separately. Along the way, there were issues such as transcription errors, input errors, and lack of photo management.



Previous inspection records were handwritten (provided by Claris International) Previous inspection records were handwritten (provided by Claris International)

In response to these issues, field staff wanted to prepare reports in real time at the inspection site, and began selecting tools. After comparing and examining several no-code/low-code development tools, we evaluated ease of use, cost performance, ease of manufacture in-house, and scalability, and adopted FileMaker.

As a result, by using an iPad or iPhone, it has become possible to complete everything from data entry to photo registration on-site, making it more efficient to write reports and check on-site. Furthermore, the need for transcription reduces input errors and the labor hours have also been reduced by approximately 25%. The email sending function that notifies you of record confirmation has also reduced communication errors.



""Plant Daily Report/Equipment Inspection Record Table"" App that can be entered on an iPad (provided by Claris International) ""Plant Daily Report/Equipment Inspection Record Table"" App that can be entered on an iPad (provided by Claris International)

The app has a function to color fields that have passed the threshold when a number is entered, allowing you to notice abnormal values ​​on the spot, making it possible to detect problems early. There is no longer any need to use paper forms, making it paperless and highly searchable. This not only made many tasks more efficient, but also made it easier to compare and analyze with past data.

Furthermore, by digitalizing input and stamps, there is no need to bring paper, pens, or seals to the production line, avoiding the risk of foreign matter contamination. It is said that this has also led to the achievement of certification for the ""FSSC22000"" (an international standard for food safety management systems).

The alcohol quality management department digitizes ""taste"" data. Using your iPhone, you enter the numbers that evaluate the quality of the shochu into FileMaker's ""Certified Liquor Evaluation App."" By linking digital records of ""Taste"" and preparation data, it is expected that the speed and accuracy of product development will be improved.

Following the success of in-app production and digitalization of operations at recycling plants, FileMaker has been adopted as a common tool to drive DX across the organization. Currently, it is used by more than 10 departments, including manufacturing, alcohol quality management, bottling, quality assurance, and supply chain management (SCM), and it is said that a company-wide culture of working on DX has been established.",zdnet

この機能が最初に導入されるのは「Microsoft Word」で、Officeスイートの他のアプリケージョンについては、今後のアップデートで追加される予定だ。Startup Boostは「Windows Task Scheduler」内のタスクとして表示され、機能の選択は完全にユーザーに委ねられている。そのため、Officeアプリにメモリーを食われることを望まないなら、簡単にオフにできる。

Microsoftは米国時間3月26日付のメッセージで、「MicrosoftはStartup Boostタスクを新たに導入する。これはOfficeアプリケーションのパフォーマンスと読み込み時間を最適化するものだ」と説明している。「展開は2025年5月から開始され、まずはWordが対象となる。このタスクの導入は任意で、Windows Task Schedulerに表示され、アプリ内の設定で無効にできる」

Speed Boostはどのような仕組みで起動の高速化を実現しているのだろうか？ ユーザーが「Windows」にログインすると、他のスケジュールされたタスク、プログラム、サービスが自動的に起動する。だがそれと同様に、関連するタスクもひそかに起動している。その後、Officeアプリはユーザーが起動させるまで一時停止の状態に置かれる。また、起動されない場合はシステムがメモリーから削除してリソースを解放する。

Speed Boostがアクティブ化されるのは、使用しているPCのメモリーとリソースが十分で、この機能がオンになってもWindowsのパフォーマンスに影響しない場合のみだ。具体的には、使用可能なメモリーが8GB以上、ディスクの空きスペースが5GB以上必要だ。また「省エネ機能」がオンになっている時も、Startup Boostは無効にされる。

Startup Boostを必要としないユーザーも、問題はない。（展開された後に）Wordで無効にするなら、「ファイル」メニューから「オプション」＞「全般」＞「起動時の設定」と進む。5月になると、ここに「Startup Boost」という新しい設定ができるので、使わない場合はチェックボックスのチェックを外せばいい。ほかにTask Schedulerで表示して無効にすることもできる。

This has significantly improved business efficiency, including a 30% reduction in the number of operators responding to the company. LINE WORKS announced it on March 27th.

LINE WORKS AiCall is a telephone response AI service that combines voice recognition, voice synthesis, and conversation control. Based on the customer's free speech, AI quickly distributes inquiries to accurate channels. Based on the high recognition accuracy of the proprietary AI model and the know-how of a scenario writer who is well-versed in voice UI, we achieve the optimal user experience (UX). It is also possible to link with private branch exchanges (PBXs) and CRMs.

Credit Saison, which operates a credit card business, has approximately 35 million members. To respond to more than 200,000 inquiries a month, the company operated a push-type automatic voice response system (IVR), but the number of cases where customers hang up the phone in the middle of an automatic response, or cases where appropriate allocations lead to manned responses, increasing the burden on operators.

Credit Saison has named the AI-based customer-responsive system ""AI Navi."" LINE WORKS AiCall determines the content of the inquiry from conversations with the customer and allocates it to the most appropriate channel. For example, inquiries that are most suitable for web procedures are directed to the web via SMS, and those that are completed with IVR are transferred to the channel. Furthermore, any items that require manned service will be transferred to the operator.

By linking the inquiry contents through a dashboard, operators can check the needs in advance, allowing for smooth responses. After the introduction of LINE WORKS AiCall, the number of operators responded to the company was reduced by 30%, and the IVR completion rate increased by 40%. It also reduces the psychological burden on operators.",zdnet

The company aims to start operations within fiscal 2030.

This project will migrate large-scale core systems from Kyoei Fire to the public cloud, creating a flexible and efficient system environment. By making the migration destination a public cloud, IT resources can be managed easily, cost optimization and development using advanced IT technology can be achieved.

Hitachi will visualize current programs through pre-verification using the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) service, and slimmize the programs to be migrated. By adopting Hitachi's open middleware, which has a wealth of experience in migrations from mainframes and operating in public clouds, it is said that application changes during migration to a minimum, achieving a quick and reliable migration.

Hitachi will use generation AI to reduce the burden on migration and development work and improve accuracy. The company aims to achieve a safe and secure transition thanks to its track record and know-how that has supported many customers in the transition, as well as a modernization team specializing in the insurance and mutual aid fields.

According to the company, many companies have faced mainframe challenges in recent years. The growing number of programs and black boxes has increased development costs, and the shortage of mainframe engineers, are becoming more serious. In addition to the similar challenges, the Kyoei Fire was also urgently required to modernize core systems in order to promote DX and strengthen cooperation with external services.

https://zdnet.com,"The next evolution of SaaS--To ""Services as Software"" provide autonomous services through AI",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231021/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT","Software as a Service (SaaS) has been at the heart of the technology world for at least 20 years, providing full access to applications over the Internet. Currently, artificial intelligence (AI) is overturning this mechanism and is beginning to autonomously utilize applications to provide services. This is called ""Services as Software"" (SaS).

AI is creating this new world for technology personnel and business staff. Frank Diana, a futurist at Tata Consultancy Services, wrote in a recent post: ""Companies have previously bought software and hired human experts to run it,"" he said. ""AI is trying to turn that model over. There will be more and more designing corporate processes in AI from the start. Rather than adding AI later, it will be the default worker. Almost all occupations will be affected by this change.""

A survey of 1,000 companies by HFS found that 60% of companies are considering procuring their services as technology products. Similarly, 60% of companies plan to ""replace some or all of their professional services with some kind of AI within three to five years.""

Similar trends are occurring in the daily IT maintenance, human resources, procurement, accounting and customer service operations. ""It's becoming much easier to replicate these tasks with evolving generator AI and agent software, and the capabilities of public and private clouds that protect and expand large volumes of transactions are underpinned by HFS authors Saurabh Gupta and Phil Fersht.

Diana says that tasks that once required a team of experts are now being handled by AI-equipped systems that can autonomously perform tasks,"" he said. ""This transformation is not limited to automation, it redefines how businesses use and deliver services. This new model represents a major shift from the past: software is no longer a tool for human workers, and in many cases software becomes workers.""

This shows that a change in the role of technology professionals is on the verge of the forefront. ""The SaaS model was primarily focused on applications hosted in the cloud,"" Diana told ZDNET. Services as Software ""incorporating intelligent technologies such as AI, digital twins, predictive analytics, and autonomous systems requires human experts to shift their role from infrastructure management to dynamic, adaptive services orchestration.""

""This highlights the importance of experts rethinking their skillsets and prioritizing AI literacy, strategic thinking and human-machine synergies,"" Diana continues. ""In addition, adapting to new career paths with an emphasis on orchestrating an integrated service ecosystem and strengthening collaboration between departments will become mandatory.""

To prepare for this change, Diana urged technology professionals to ""advanced continuing learning, improve AI and automation skills, and hone soft skills such as communication and problem solving."" This will allow technology professionals to ""establish themselves as strategically realizing business outcomes, rather than simply being a tech caretaker.""

Even though automation is expanding, Diana emphasizes that human expertise is still essential. For example, surveillance and ethics are essential because ""human governance is necessary for AI to ensure fairness, compliance and safety."" Also, we must not forget that AI can process data, but it is humans who read context, draw visions, and demonstrate leadership.

Gupta and Fersht pointed to the challenges facing technology personnel and business staff as the service and software merger progressed, writing: ""Service and software representatives have different departments and different terminology, but now we need to join hands and develop them in a way that everyone can understand. It's not like buying and implementing a brand new SaS solution, as with ERP solutions. Here we need to define the true business value that AI technology brings and set prices based on its value and expected outcome.""",zdnet

Introduction

Until last time, I mentioned the specific methodology and approach to implementing data management infrastructure to realize data-driven decision-making, and introduced the three essential pillars of this: not just introducing tools and platforms, but also planning clear data strategies, building an organizational structure and fostering a culture.

This article will introduce the process and decision-making process for data cloud adoption, as well as the consideration steps, requirements arrangement, and the operational image after implementation.

Clarify business issues and develop data strategies

While data is already the core of business, it is also true that many companies have ""data but are not being able to utilize it."" When considering introducing a data cloud, the most important thing is to clarify and put ""business issues you want to solve.""

Recently, AI has attracted a lot of attention with the emergence of generated AI, but these are ""one of the means to utilize data,"" and the ""data strategy"" is the key to the first thing. The availability of the necessary data is essential for the use of generation AI and other things.

It is important to construct a data strategy based on current business issues and portray what it should be and what it wants to be. This will serve as the goal and criteria for carrying out all subsequent tasks.

Clarification of factors

The next step is to delve into business issues, clarify the gap between these factors and the current situation, and put it into words. Here, in addition to factors that depend on current foundations and processes, there are various factors, including the lack of data culture penetration introduced in the previous article.

Examples of factors related to the foundation include:

Data is siloed and it is not easy to access the required data

There are challenges in the scalability and performance of the foundation

Query performance is susceptible to other processes and is not stable

These will be detailed in the ""Technical Requirements for Selecting a Foundation"" section below.

Action Plan

Once the factors are clear, the next step is to develop an action plan as a solution. Action plans include improvements to software aspects such as ""culture fostering"" and ""human resource development,"" but first we'll give you some points related to the ""base.""

Many people choose to introduce or renew the foundation (migration) as one of the actions (problem solving methods), but in this case, the ""technical requirements for selecting the foundation"" and ""priority"" created in ""Clearing the Factors"" are important.

For example, if ""data is siloed and it is not easy to access the necessary data"" is a priority and we want to solve the issue.

It also costs development and operational costs, and does not cause data transfer between platforms

While achieving easy access, you can provide detailed permission control based on position and organizational authority

We will organize these points as ""requirements.""

On the other hand, one of the factors is that, from the data provider's point of view, it is difficult to see how data is being used in business. It is also important to delve into the value and share each data based on actual examples (use cases) of measures using data.",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,"The reason why ""Ransom Attack"" is the 10 major threats of IPAs is the No. 1 spot for five consecutive years",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230875/,"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 06:00:00 GMT","How to Walk with Corporate Security: The reason why ""Ransom Attack"" is the 10 major threats of IPAs is the only one to rank for five consecutive years

This series, ""How to Walk in Corporate Security,"" presents perspectives and tips for improving cybersecurity skills, while lining up the current situation, challenges and problems surrounding the security industry.

The 2025 edition of ""10 Greatest Information Security Threats,"" which the Information Technology Promotion Agency (IPA) has released every March (only ranking and summary for several years now) was released on March 7th. Approximately 200 members deliberated and voted on potential threats that were thought to have a major social impact from the information security incident that occurred in 2024.

The members are mainly researchers in the field of security, but they include a large amount of opinions from less specialized people, such as sales representatives at IT vendors. Therefore, rankings do not refer to the extent to which security experts consider the level of a threat, but rather to vote based on the impression of a security incident or accident, and it may be more accurate to call it a popularity vote.

This time, we will explain why ""damage caused by ransom attacks"" ranked number one for the 2025 edition of the 10 major information security threats for the 2025 edition, for the fifth consecutive year.

Ransomware damage is the number one spot in five consecutive years, along with targeted attacks

I rarely feel any special feelings about the annual outcomes of the 10 major threats. This is because, as mentioned earlier, this ranking itself is nothing more than a popularity vote.

Since I am a regular business in marketing that specializes in security, the results often go as expected. Of course, about one in 10 cases may be a little ""surprising,"" but in most cases the results are within the expected range.

Still, if you observe the rankings in the medium to long term, you can see trends in security measures and trends in public opinion. By looking at the rankings in the medium to long term period of 5 to 10 years, it is often possible to visualize the trends in attack methods, the level of attention that people have received about major incidents, and whether or not they have been continuously recognized.

The number one ranking in the 2025 edition was ""damage caused by ransom attacks."" It has been ranked number one for the fifth consecutive year since 2021.

So far, the only one that has ranked number one in this ranking for five consecutive years is ""theft of confidential information through targeted attacks (the expression varies slightly from year to year)"" from 2016 to 2020. Since the following year, ""damage caused by ransom attacks"" ranked number one for five consecutive years, it can be seen that for the 10 years from 2016 to 2025, targeted attacks were overwhelmingly raging in the first half and ransom attacks in the second half.

Looking at the five years since targeted attacks were number one, ransom attacks are ranked in the top position (7th in 2016, 2nd in 2017, 2nd in 2018, 3rd in 2019, and 5th in 2020). Even in the last five years, targeted attacks have been in the top position (2nd in 2021, 2nd in 2022, 3rd in 2023, 4th in 2014, and 5th in 2025). This distinctive trend in rankings is a result that makes you wonder whether it is causal or correlational.",zdnet

However, for those who like Apple TV Plus's Severance, there's good news. ""Lumon Terminal Pro"" is now available as a new Easter egg, which has been featured in many dramas, at Apple's online store in the US. This fictional computer is displayed at the top of the Mac store page, and even has a dedicated introductory page.

Since it is a Lumon device, it is unclear what kind of hardware it is, but the page displays a warning saying ""spoiler warning"" and also includes a link to the approximately 11-minute making-of footage.

Season 2 of the drama has recently ended on Apple TV Plus, and season 3 has already been decided. In the footage on the Apple Online Store's Lumon Terminal Pro page, co-creator Ben Stiller talks about how three editorial staff put together the 83TB footage into the final episode of Season 2.

It also explains how to edit the marching band scene in the final episode, as well as video processing for episode 7, where the atmosphere changes dramatically within the work. The third part also tells how much music supports the tone of the drama.

Use the Apple Online Store to promote Apple TV

Of course, this is also part of the promotion. Through fictional retro devices that appear in Apple-produced dramas, they are promoting the latest Apple hardware to video editors and musicians.

Apple is in a unique position to perform these crossover productions without any discomfort, according to Andy Tsai, professor of business analytics at Santa Clara University's Leavy School of Management. This is because it doesn't give the impression of being as ""intrusive"" as tie-ups with other hardware manufacturers or ""reverse product placement,"" in which products from real companies are introduced.

""I think it's a really good idea,"" Tsai said. ""This is a slightly special combination of situations. They produce their own programs while selling iconic hardware, and the audience is integrated into it. They have the perfect conditions.""

According to Tsai, the model itself has a precedent in which Apple invests billions of dollars in Apple TV Plus to produce content that can be played on its own devices. It goes back to the days when General Electric made radio and television programs and sold receivers and television at the same time.

""Apple is trying to build an ecosystem of hardware and content, but they're doing it very well. Many competitors can't get that much profit margin, so it's going to be difficult to make such a wealth of funding strategy,"" says Tsai.

Tsai said Apple TV Plus is just part of Apple's long-term goal of expanding its services division.

""Service has a higher profit margin than hardware,"" Tsai also points out. However, at this point, it is believed that the Apple TV Plus subscription fee alone is not enough to cover production costs.

Meanwhile, Tsai says that he is a fan of the Lumon Terminal Pro itself. It's because you can imagine that if Steve Jobs had remade the Apple IIe in a retro style at the time when the iMac was released at its peak, it would have just turned out like this.

具体的には、3月24日に配信を開始した街の独自アプリ「TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITYアプリ」や、さまざまなロボットを制御する「ロボットプラットフォーム」、鉄道の運行情報、セキュリティゲートの通過情報、防犯カメラの映像、「au」「Suica」の位置情報・属性情報・興味関心のデータ、防犯防災、イベント、商業、オフィスなど、異分野の膨大なデータを個人情報保護に配慮しながら融合、分析する。

提供するサービスの一例としては、4月11日にロボットによる「フードデリバリーサービス」を開始する。リアルタイムな街の混雑情報を防犯カメラデータから取得し、人の多いルートを避けて最短で商品を配送するという。

アプリでは、改札やゲート通過時に興味関心にあった情報の配信、状況に応じて生成AIが投稿内容を変化させるまちマップなどを提供する。3月30日まではダウンロードおよびSuicaを登録して高輪ゲートウェイ駅を出札すると「TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITYオリジナル仕様 前田珈琲のドリップコーヒーパック1点」をプレゼントするキャンペーンも実施中だ。

そのほか、リアルタイムの人流データなどから街の未来をシミュレーションするダッシュボードを運用し、イベントや災害時などに活用するという。

なお、ネットワーク環境はサービス追加や環境変化に対して柔軟に拡張・対応できるよう構築する。その上にさらに、高セキュリティ・高拡張性かつ災害に強いサーバー基盤を構築し、都市OSや各サービスのデータを安全に連携させるという。街と「au」のデータによるスマートシティを実現し、利用者に快適なサービスの提供を目指す。

KDDI ビジネス事業本部 プロダクト本部 スマートシティ事業開発部長の保科康弘氏は、「用途に合わせたセンサーを個別に設置する場合コスト面での課題が生じやすく、PoCや実証実験止まりになりやすい。例えば既存の防犯カメラシステムなど、元々あるものを別用途でも活用できるようチャレンジする。皆さんが気持ち悪くならないよう、丁寧に説明しながらやっていきたい」と話す。

100社以上が集うスタートアップ拠点も--「グローバルゲートウェイとして交流生み出す」

THE LINKPILLAR 1では、このほかにもさまざまな企業と共創する。例えば6・7階には、東京大学、NUS、博報堂、リバネス、ジェイアール東日本企画などを運営パートナーに迎えたスタートアップの支援拠点「TAKANAWA GATEWAY Link Scholars’ Hub（LiSH）」を設置する。国内外のスタートアップ100社以上と、アカデミア・アクセラレーター・ベンチャーキャピタルをかけ合わせ、100年先の心豊かな暮らしにつながるサービスを創出を目指す。

JR東日本 マーケティング本部 まちづくり部門 品川ユニット（次世代まちづくり創造）マネージャーの出川智之氏は、「江戸時代、高輪は海であり、江戸と日本各地の交流の玄関口だった。約150年前、日本初の鉄道開業時には、海上に堤を築き、海の上を鉄道が走った。日本の築城土木技術と西洋の機械美術が融合し、イノベーションを生み出した場所だ。このような交流とイノベーションの記憶を受け継ぎ、日本各地および世界への玄関口、グローバルゲートウェイとして交流を生み出していきたい」と、改めて命名意図を説明する。

「TAKANAWA GATEWAY CITYは、100年先を見据えた、心豊かな暮らしのための実験場でもある。この街に関わる多様な共創パートナーが持つアイデアやサービス、そして知を掛け合わせ、より良い未来に資する新たなソリューションを生み出し、国内外からのフィードバックを得て進化させ、多様な社会課題を解決しながら未来へと挑戦し続ける街でありたい。国内外のあらゆる人、文化、テクノロジーをつないで良い未来を創造し、地球も人も健康かつ街で生み出される活動がポジティブに貢献する『地球益』を目指す」と話した。
