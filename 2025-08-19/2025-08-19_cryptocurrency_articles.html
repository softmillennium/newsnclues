                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and altcoins continue to sell-off, but Solana's fundamentals and accelerating institutional traction hint at a price recovery to $200. Solana's DeFi dominance and growing fees sustain network demand, boosting investors' long-term confidence. Solana's native token SOL (SOL) dropped 15.5% since reaching $209.80 on Thursday, its highest price in more than six months. Solana has consolidated its role as the second-largest decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem, recording $111.5 billion in 30-day volumes. BNB Chain trailed with $60 billion, according to DefiLlama. The total value locked (TVL) on Solana reached $12.1 billion this week, up 20% in two months, further securing its vice-leadership position over BNB Chain at $7.8 billion. Several decentralized applications (DApps) such as Kamino, Jito, Jupiter, Sanctum, Raydium, and Marinade each surpassed $2 billion in TVL. Sustained activity reinforces SOL demand, as transaction fees are essential to maintaining native staking yields. Solana generated $35.6 million over 30 days, a 22% increase from the prior month. Ethereum led with $41.4 million but declined 7% in the same period. Solana ranking third in network fees is notable, considering Ethereum maintains a far larger smart contract deposit base. Solana's success is not easily replicable, since validators demand higher hardware capacity and capital commitment, making the network more robust than competitors. The growth signals rising institutional participation, a positive factor for long-term adoption. Further evidence of institutional demand comes from $2.8 billion in Solana exchange-traded futures and products (ETF / ETP). Bloomberg analysts project a 90% or greater likelihood of US Securities and Exchange Commission approval by year-end. The retracement from $209.80 sparked fears of a bearish double top. However, Solana's leadership in DEX volumes, TVL expansion, accelerating fee growth, and mounting institutional exposure collectively argue otherwise. Rather than confirming a bearish shift, these drivers support a renewed push toward $200, validating the hypothesis that traders may have turned bearish too soon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wyoming's launch of the Frontier Stable Token (FRNT) is being hailed as a milestone for crypto, but some experts warn it raises new concerns about privacy and centralization. FRNT, a stablecoin backed by U.S. dollars and Treasury bills and built on Avalanche, launched on mainnet Tuesday, Aug. 19, at the SALT Wyoming Blockchain Symposium. The token can now be spent anywhere Visa is accepted, making it the first U.S. state-backed stablecoin available to consumers. FRNT initially supports seven blockchains – Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, and Solana. This concern has already reached Congress, where lawmakers are considering restrictions on federal digital currency plans through the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. “The scary part is whether D.C. and the Fed take this as a green light to roll out their own fully controlled coin,” Kadan Stadelmann, CTO at Komodo, told The Defiant. “A federal CBDC would be surveillance on steroids. That's the nightmare scenario, a coin you can't spend without permission.” He added that while FRNT demonstrates progress in mainstream adoption, it risks blurring the line between decentralized crypto and government-issued “digital cash,” noting that if this happens, “we didn't win – they did.” Meanwhile, investment firm Keyrock projects that the stablecoin sector could capture up to $1 trillion in annual payment volume by 2030. It's literally the state putting its stamp on-chain. He also noted that while FRNT pushes another crypto use case to millions of people, it's not entirely new: “We've been swiping crypto cards for years. This is only different because it's the government's crypto card,” Stadelmann said. Mike Cahill, Initial Contributor at Pyth Network, told The Defiant the move accelerates mainstream adoption in a way private issuers alone could not. Experts say stablecoins are becoming increasingly appealing to both individuals and institutions due to their yield-bearing potential, often offering better returns than traditional banks. For context, around 21% of U.S. business bank deposits (approximately $3.85 trillion) don't earn any interest, as The Defiant previously reported. Jack O'Holleran, the co-founder and CEO of SKALE Labs, emphasized that Wyoming's launch will be a very bullish signal for stablecoins. “Wyoming just created the first real competition for Circle and Tether, who never thought they'd have to compete with government entities for business,” O'Holleran said. “More quality stablecoins with actual rigor in how they're backed and how their reserves are put together will drive mass adoption. He explained that if larger states like California or New York get the same idea, that could result in intense competition. “Wyoming might be small, but this is going to force other states to ask if they should be doing this too.” Know what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the summer of 2022, NFT (non-fungible token) platform OpenSea saw a former employee charged with pursuing a digital asset insider trading ploy. Effectively, the individual in question knew which NFTs were to be featured in advance and thus purchased them before the promotion. In May 2023, the individual was convicted by a jury and sentenced to three months in prison, which was subsequently satisfied by the time already served. It seems obvious to most, but the court saw otherwise. CI connected with Philip Moustakis, Partner at the global law firm of Seward & Kissel. It appears to be a case where there was no crime. Philip Moustakis: In short, the Court found that advance knowledge of which NFTs would be featured on the site did not have commercial value to OpenSea and thus did not qualify as traditional property under the wire fraud statute. The Court did not find that NFTs themselves are not traditional property, and one could imagine facts and circumstances, for example, a case involving theft of NFTs that would satisfy the statute. Philip Moustakis: In my view, the vast majority of NFTs are art or collectibles, not securities.

The firm is bringing its Digital Macro Master Fund and Legion Strategies on-chain in partnership with tokenization provider Tokeny and its parent, Apex Group, which manages more than $3.5 trillion in assets, according to the press release shared with CoinDesk on Tuesday. Securitization firm VERT Capital announced to tokenize $1 billion of debt and receivables on XDC network and debuted a tokenized credit platform on XRP Ledger, while tokenization specialist Securitize also offers tokens of various funds by Hamilton Lane, Apollo and KKR. The tokenized RWA market has doubled over the past year, surpassing $26 billion, per RWA.xyz data,  and is projected to grow into a trillion-dollar market by 2030, according to reports by McKinsey, Ripple, BCG and others. Avalanche increasingly aims to position itself as a hub for tokenized assets. Bergen County in New Jersey uses the network to digitize property deeds of $240 billion in real estate, combating fraud and cutting processing time.

Since launching its treasury strategy on June 2, SharpLink has rapidly built one of the largest corporate Ethereum treasuries worldwide. NEW: SharpLink acquired 143,593 ETH at ~$4,648, bringing total holdings to 740,760 ETHKey highlights for the week ending Aug 17, 2025:→ Raised $537M through ATM and direct offerings→ Added 143,593 ETH at ~$4,648 avg. “SharpLink is aligning itself with Ethereum's future as a global financial infrastructure, while giving investors direct exposure to its growth,” the company said.Capital Raise Fuels Aggressive Expansion The company notes that over $84 million in cash remains on hand, yet to be deployed for additional ETH acquisitions. This liquidity buffer ensures flexibility for further purchases should market conditions create attractive entry points.ETH Concentration Metric Shows Treasury Growth The company explained that ETH Concentration provides investors with a clearer view of yield performance and shareholder exposure to Ethereum. Unlike traditional treasury stock calculations, this metric excludes factors such as equity award vesting and debt convertibility, offering a more direct link between ETH holdings and investor value.Strategic Bet on Ethereum's Future By making ETH its primary treasury reserve asset, SharpLink joins a growing movement of companies looking beyond Bitcoin and positioning for Ethereum's role in decentralized finance, smart contracts, and next-generation financial infrastructure. “SharpLink is charting a new course—building scalable, secure, and transparent solutions that challenge outdated models,” the company states. As ETH integration deepens across industries, SharpLink's aggressive accumulation indicates a bold conviction: Ethereum will not just power decentralized finance but reshape the backbone of digital capital markets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>- Macroeconomic uncertainty from Fed policy and inflation concerns, plus SEC delays on crypto ETF approvals, deepened bearish sentiment across risk assets. - Ethereum's $3,900 support retest and altcoins like Solana ($189) highlight market fragility, while token unlocks in KAITO/MURA/MOCA add supply-side pressures. - Analysts remain divided: some see potential recovery above $117,000, while others warn of deeper pullbacks if Bitcoin fails to stabilize key levels. Bitcoin's recent price action has drawn attention as the cryptocurrency fell to a daily low of $113,770, with market sentiment turning increasingly bearish. The broader cryptocurrency market has mirrored this downturn, experiencing a 10% decline in altcoin values as Bitcoin struggled to hold key technical levels [1]. A break below this level could signal further downward pressure, particularly on altcoins like Solana, which have already shown signs of weakness [1]. The upcoming Jackson Hole symposium and Federal Reserve policy announcements are expected to play a pivotal role in shaping investor sentiment. Inflationary concerns and ongoing tariff discussions have already contributed to a negative trend in risk assets, with the crypto market being no exception [1]. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed decisions on ETF applications for cryptocurrencies like Solana and XRP, adding to the sense of uncertainty among traders. This lack of regulatory clarity has kept many investors on the sidelines. For example, Solana closed below $189, showing signs of vulnerability after reaching $160 earlier in the year [1]. However, the broader market remains divided, with some fearing a deeper pullback should Bitcoin fail to reclaim key support levels. Ethereum is emerging as a key indicator for the altcoin market. Technical analysis suggests that the asset may retest the $3,900 support level before mounting a potential 100% rally to new highs, assuming it can overcome resistance at $4,400 [7]. The outcome of this liquidity battle could determine whether altcoins follow a similar trajectory or continue to underperform Bitcoin. For Fartcoin, the analyst suggests that a local bottom may have been reached, but a further drop to $0.77 is still possible if the current base breaks. Investors are also keeping an eye on token unlock schedules, which can influence circulating supply and price stability. Coins like KAITO, MURA, and MOCA are facing increased supply pressures as new tokens enter the market [8]. As Bitcoin continues to consolidate and test key support levels, the broader crypto market remains in a transitional phase. With macroeconomic conditions remaining uncertain, market participants are closely watching for signs of stabilization in both Bitcoin's price and the broader crypto ecosystem.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Outflows from U.S. ETFs tracking Ethereum's spot price hit $197 million on Monday—the second-highest figure ever for daily withdrawals. BRN Head of Research Timothy Misir warned both factors are "pressuring near-term sentiment." The outflows come days after ETH failed to secure a fresh all-time high above $4,891.70, which was set back in November 2021. All signs point to investors taking profits off the table after Ethereum surged by 66% in the space of a year, attracting a slew of institutional interest. Bitcoin funds weren't immune from these outflows on Monday, but suffered a less modest draw of $122 million by comparison. Despite BTC also retracing from an all-time high of $124,457.12 last Thursday, Misir argued that whales are continuing to accumulate—with 20,061 BTC added to wallets holding at least 10,000 coins over the past six days. "Crypto remains sensitive to these signals," Misir wrote, adding that the prospect of further negotiations could bolster risk appetite among investors. Bitcoin Jumps to New All-Time High Price as Ethereum Nears Record "Geopolitical developments around U.S.–Ukraine–Russia trilateral talks now inject additional two-way risk: a ceasefire could catalyze BTC's push above $120K, while escalation risks argue for caution. Defensive positioning and selective accumulation remain the prudent approach," Misir wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Figure Technology's IPO is set to take place on Nasdaq, and it's stirring the crypto space into a frenzy. This isn't just a big step for the company, but a potential turning point for the entire crypto payroll landscape. With a financial comeback under its belt, there are questions about blockchain innovation's future amid the ongoing regulatory dance. Let's unpack how this IPO might reshape crypto payroll, usher in financial inclusion, and spark a new breed of startups in the crypto realm. Figure Technology is carving out its niche as a frontrunner in blockchain lending, recently filing for an IPO on Nasdaq with the ticker “FIGR.” The financial figures are striking, with revenues nearing $191 million—a 22% climb from last year—and a leap from $13 million in losses to $29 million in profit. Co-founded by Mike Cagney, a significant player in fintech, Figure operates on the Provenance blockchain. They provide cutting-edge lending services and asset tokenization for institutional clients. Cagney believes blockchain can remove financial middlemen, cut costs, and boost transparency in markets that are usually hard to navigate. As the crypto industry bounces back, driven by favorable regulations, Figure's IPO might clear a path for other fintech companies to explore public markets. This is particularly true for firms like Figure, which face the SEC's tough stance treating crypto assets as securities. But there is a silver lining—recent moves toward clearer regulations could allow innovation to flourish while keeping investors safe. As regulators start to clarify their guidelines and bring in crypto-savvy officials, the chance for a more balanced approach may emerge, potentially spurring R&D in the sector. Figure's unique take on crypto payroll shows how blockchain can drive financial inclusion. With crypto-backed loans free from the usual credit checks, and trading without fees, Figure is lowering the hurdles for people who are underserved to access financial services. This is part of a wider trend in fintech, where digital advancements are making financial services more available. Integrating blockchain payments into payroll not only streamlines processes but can also instill trust and transparency among users. This mirrors a growing trend in fintech where startups are increasingly incorporating crypto and blockchain to enhance their services. Tools and platforms that support crypto payroll are becoming more popular, with startups looking at the potential of digital banking tailored to the crypto industry. By proactively addressing regulatory issues and forming smart partnerships, these startups can position themselves competitively in a bustling market. In short, Figure Technology's story showcases blockchain's ability to reshape financial services, drive innovation, and broaden access to financial resources.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SharpLink (SBET) snapped up a whopping $667 million of Ethereum (ETH-USD) at sky-high prices, pushing its holdings to $3.2 billion, even as its shares slid 12% on the news. The sports betting platform made the purchase just as ETH traded near record highs of $4,700, showing it's willing to pay top dollar to keep building its crypto war chest. SharpLink disclosed in a U.S. SEC filing that it bought 143,593 Ethereum at an average of $4,648 each, totaling $667.4 million. The purchase boosted its total stash to 740,760 ETH, worth around $3.2 billion at current market prices. What's interesting is that rather than waiting for a dip, SharpLink added at the top end of ETH's trading range. Staking allows the company to earn rewards while helping run Ethereum's proof-of-stake network. So far, those rewards amount to 1,388 ETH, worth more than $5.8 million. Still, SharpLink warned in its filing that staking rules may be subject to regulatory changes, which could impact this strategy. Shares tumbled 12% on Friday and closed Monday at $20.10, down 13.5% over the past five days, according to TradingView. Investors seem uneasy about the balance between big crypto bets and actual profitability. SharpLink's ETH purchase comes as institutions are scooping up the token at record pace. Ethereum ETFs alone saw $3.7 billion in inflows between Aug. 5 and last Thursday, reflecting heavy demand. Its main rival, BitMine (BMNR) , announced an even bigger buy of 373,000 ETH. This lifted its holdings to 1.52 million ETH worth about $6.6 billion. Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) remains king of corporate crypto reserves, though its focus is Bitcoin rather than Ether. That leaves Strategy on top overall, but SharpLink and BitMine are racing for dominance in Ethereum.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SharpLink Gaming, the Nasdaq-listed affiliate marketing and gaming software firm-turned Ethereum treasury company, said on Tuesday that it spent another $667 million on ether. The company said it has purchased another 143,593 ETH at an average price of $4,648 per ether ($667.4 million) — bringing its total holdings to 740,760 (nearly $3.2 billion at current prices). Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin serves as SharpLink's chairman of the board. SharpLink is the number two Ethereum treasury company when ranked by holdings; BitMine Immersion Tech is the leading ETH treasury with over 1.5 million ether, according to The Block Data Dashboard. After Bitcoin treasury Strategy, BitMine claims to be the number two DAT globally. ETH was changing hands at $4,238.062 as of 10:35 a.m. ET, according to The Block Price Page. SharpLink also said it raised $537 million during the week ending Aug. 17 and has $84 million in cash it has not yet deployed. The company's stock dipped last week after SharpLink disclosed a $103 million net loss for the second quarter. For the quarter, the company reported a 98% increase in "ETH Concentration," a measure of how much ETH the company holds per every 1,000 potential shares, which includes actual shares plus all the possible shares from warrants, options, RSUs, pre-funded warrants, and so on. "Ethereum is the trust layer for the decentralized economy, and SharpLink's aggressive accumulation, staking and strategic management of ETH set it apart from any other public company in the market," Lubin said last week. "SharpLink is actively compounding value for our fellow stockholders through yield generation and intelligent capital deployment."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investor sentiment has shifted again, as Ethereum ETF flows dwindled after weeks of frenzy. With its token priced at $0.0969 and a wallet beta launch planned in Q3, Remittix is solidly on its path to becoming one of the best crypto presales of 2025, connecting payments in the real world with blockchain technology. The price has cooled off, although volume surged to $54.53 billion, rising a whopping 116.04%, which means both retail and institutional investors are still interested. Its market cap stands at $522.17 billion today, and its relevance to decentralized finance and the broader Layer 1 ecosystem has strengthened. In spite of that, though, recent deceleration of ETF inflows has investors questioning near-term momentum, with attention turned to new altcoins that aim to solve real-world financial problems. The project has made its first centralized exchange (CEX) listing on BitMart after reaching the milestone of more than $20 million raised and selling more than 608 million tokens. The listing is expected to introduce stronger liquidity, wider global accessibility, and easier access for new investors who would like to buy the RTX token. Remittix will launch its beta wallet during Q3, aimed at real-time crypto-to-fiat exchange between 30+ currencies. With over 40 cryptos being supported on launch and real-time FX conversion, the wallet will make Remittix one of the top-ranking cryptos under $1 that offers real adoption rather than speculation. In contrast to hype-based launches or meme tokens, Remittix is positioned towards solving real use cases. This commitment to genuine adoption already made RTX among the leading DeFi projects in 2025. By combining decentralized exchange benefits with centralized exchange ease of access, Remittix is a cross-chain DeFi platform poised to thrive in the long term. With the momentum growing and milestones coming along, Remittix is making waves among currently live crypto presales. Investors seeking the next popular altcoin 2025 with real utility find in RTX's presale and upcoming wallet launch a unique entry point prior to big listings spreading its adoption.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the long-term prospects of growth in XRP and Remittix's increasing presale popularity, investors are weighing the possibilities in both tried-and-true and new digital currencies. XRP is priced at $3.07, experiencing a small dip by 1.29% in the past 24 hours. Its use in the financial settlement keeps it relevant, although new entrants are providing stiff competition. Investors who consider Best Altcoins To Buy Now, XRP Price patterns are increasingly considering presales such as Remittix for early access. Remittix (RTX) is soon to become a standout on the top crypto presale of 2025. This action boosts liquidity and makes RTX more liquid, besides opening doors for mass acceptance. Besides the exchange listing, Remittix is preparing for its Q3 beta wallet launch, enabling users to send cryptocurrency directly to bank accounts in more than 30 nations. As a Remittix DeFi project, RTX is working to simplify payments by bridging crypto and everyday banking. It stands apart from speculative meme coins because it is built for utility — with real-time crypto-to-fiat transfers, support for 40+ digital assets, and low-gas-fee crypto transactions. All of these capabilities put RTX on the next big altcoin 2025 run. As a means of investment for those considering early stage investing in crypto, RTX offers sound use cases coupled with strong presale adoption. The discussion on Best Altcoins To Buy Now, XRP Price contains a shift in investor strategies. XRP is still one of the best crypto to buy now because it already has a footing in payments, while Remittix is a fresh crypto token launch intended for adoption.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The combined crypto market cap is down 0.5% on the day, slipping to $3.95 trillion as major caps like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are down 0.5%, 0.9%, and 0.7%, respectively. Altcoins such as PUMP and VIRTUALS have also taken sizeable hits, with Pump.fun's native token down over 10% and AI powerhouse Virtuals Protocol down 3%. As we enter yet another day of red across the crypto market, traders and analysts are scrambling to put together a fresh piece of technical analysis to suit their agendas. Whether the two leading cryptocurrencies drop that low, this ongoing dip is presenting some incredible buying opportunities. As for Solana meme coins, PUMP is directly responsible for many of them due to many launches taking place on the Pump.fun platform, and they are suffering greatly. Whenever a market-wide correction occurs, meme coins are often the biggest victims, and this time is no different. However, there is optimism that Q4 will prove a bountiful period across crypto. While meme coins tend to go down faster than your average altcoin, they also reverse the hardest. For this reason, traders should ask themselves, “What is the best Solana meme coin to buy before Q4?” While there is no telling how low Solana meme coins may go during this correction, Snorter Bot (SNORT) can still be in the presale phase and not at the mercy of volatile price swings. On the surface, SNORT seems like just another meme coin. From day one, this rate has been more competitive than that of other trading bots, such as Trojan, BONKBot, and Banana Gun. Since its initial coin offering (ICO) went live, Snorter Bot has raised over $3.2M in just over three months, demonstrating strong investor interest in a project combining meme coin appeal and utility. Snorter Bot features built-in MEV (miner-extractable value) protection, an innovative sniper tool, and a copy-trade function. These features enable users to follow their favorite wallets and influencers while also allowing them to acquire low-cost tokens during the hottest new launches. Initially, SNORT will only be available on Solana; however, the bot has been designed with multi-chain capabilities. This offers traders a perfect passive income opportunity while they wait for the Snorter Bot ICO to conclude. Just under 24 hours are remaining until the SNORT presale moves onto its next price stage, meaning that once the timer hits zero, its current price of $0.1017 will be gone for good.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SoFi Partners with Lightspark to Power Blockchain-Enabled International Money Transfers SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SoFi (NASDAQ: SOFI) announced its upcoming international money transfer service, enabling members to send funds abroad directly from the SoFi app with lower fees and faster delivery compared to traditional remittance service providers. Lightspark, a leading enterprise infrastructure provider that uses the Bitcoin Lightning Network, will enable the technology via Universal Money Address (UMA), to send and receive money seamlessly, with access to an open global network for payments. SoFi will be one of the first US-banks to offer a blockchain-powered remittances service. “For many SoFi members who regularly send money to loved ones internationally, the ability to quickly transfer money at low cost isn't just a convenience, it's a meaningful improvement to their everyday financial lives,” said Anthony Noto, SoFi CEO. “By embedding this directly into SoFi's app, we're unlocking the value of blockchain technology, to give members faster, smarter, and more inclusive access to their money.” “SoFi is one of the most innovative and forward-thinking financial platforms in the US today," said David Marcus, CEO and co-founder of Lightspark. "Digital banks are embracing UMA because it's fast, cheap, and secure, and it uses the only open payments network that exists, Bitcoin. UMA on SoFi means customers can move dollars instantly, any time, globally, and we're excited to see the demand via SoFi's waitlist, proving that people are ready for the future of payments.” SoFi's international money transfer service will launch later this year. To ensure full transparency, exchange rate and fees will be displayed up front, before members hit send. SoFi's new international money transfer service, powered by UMA, converts U.S. dollars to Bitcoin in real-time and routes funds across borders using the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Lightspark powers a global network of partner banks and financial platforms. This phased approach ensures speed, security, and consistency for members from day one, with even more countries to follow. SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) is a one-stop shop for digital financial services on a mission to help people achieve financial independence to realize their ambitions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Katten and CRC-Oyster teamed up to launch a three-part webinar series on "Crypto in Focus: Regulation, Risk and the Road Ahead." Part 1, "Digital Assets Regulatory Updates," brought together Katten Partners Dan Davis, Co-Chair of Financial Markets and Regulation, Susan Light, Co-Chair of Broker-Dealer Regulation, with CRC-Oyster Managing Directors Jeff Gearhart and Dan Garrett, to discuss the changing legislative, regulatory and market environment for digital assets and cryptocurrencies in the United States. The session focused on significant new laws, regulatory initiatives and the practical implications for market participants, retail investors and service providers. The GENIUS Act marks a notable milestone as the first federal legislation specifically addressing digital assets, with a focus on payment stablecoins.1 Signed into law by President Donald Trump, the GENIUS Act establishes a regulatory perimeter for payment stablecoins, including federal and state registration pathways, reserve requirements and business limitations for issuers. It also recognizes the utility of payment stablecoins as collateral and for fund transfers, aiming to provide greater regulatory clarity and stability in this segment of the market. The bill proposes clearer delineation of regulatory authority between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and introduces new registration categories for entities involved in spot digital asset activities. If enacted, the Clarity Act would grant the CFTC primary oversight of spot digital asset markets, filling a current regulatory gap. Federal regulatory bodies have significantly increased their engagement with crypto. The White House has issued multiple executive orders and established task forces to coordinate policy across agencies.2 The SEC, CFTC, as well as banking regulators are all actively developing guidance and seeking industry input.3 The SEC has established a Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, and has issued new guidance on digital asset activities.4 Recent public statements from SEC leadership emphasize a commitment to ensuring US leadership in digital asset innovation and to providing timely guidance on best practices for distribution, custody and trading.5 The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), while reliant on SEC rulemaking, is also engaging with market participants and focusing on core regulatory concerns such as accurate public communications, supervision, anti-money laundering and recordkeeping.6 The CFTC continues to issue guidance and grant exemptive relief,7 including recent requests for comment on leveraged spot digital asset products.8 The agency is exploring ways to provide additional clarity and facilitate the development of new products within its existing authorities. Traditional financial institutions and service providers are increasingly seeking to integrate digital assets into their business models, while decentralized finance (DeFi) and international entities are exploring entry into the US market. There is a strong emphasis on education and collaboration, as firms work to understand the regulatory environment and prepare for forthcoming changes. A notable shift has occurred in regulatory engagement, with agencies now more open to dialogue and collaboration with industry participants. Law firms and consultants are facilitating these interactions, helping clients navigate complex and evolving requirements.10 While regulatory frameworks are still under development, there is a clear trend toward increased transparency, engagement and the establishment of best practices. Key regulatory definitions and requirements, such as those related to possession and control of digital assets, are still being clarified. FINRA's ability to approve new business models is limited by the current absence of a comprehensive regulatory framework from the SEC. Firms must continue to exercise diligence in areas such as customer communications, supervision, anti-money laundering and recordkeeping. The US digital asset regulation is undergoing rapid transformation, with significant legislative and regulatory initiatives underway. Market participants should anticipate continued developments and increased regulatory clarity in the near term. Engagement with regulators, industry collaboration and adherence to evolving best practices will be critical for firms seeking to participate in this dynamic sector.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin—alongside other major cryptocurrencies ethereum and XRP—have fallen sharply, raising fears of a crypto market crash after it bubbled up to an all-time high of $4.2 trillion this month (just as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk breaks his silence on crypto). The bitcoin price has plunged from an all-time high of $124,000 per bitcoin just last week, dropping around 10% to $114,000, while ethereum and Ripple's XRP have seen similar declines despite U.S. president Donald Trump dropping a surprise $12.2 trillion crypto bombshell. Bitcoin and crypto's decline, coming just as JPMorgan makes a game-changing Federal Reserve flip, follows Wall Street giants issuing a warning that the recently passed Genius Act stablecoin bill could trigger a $6.6 trillion flood of account withdrawals. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. banking groups that count Wall Street giants such as JPMorgan and Bank of America as members have urged Congress to close a loophole in the recently passed Genius Act stablecoin bill that allows issuers of the dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies to offer yields via affiliates, warning it could trigger huge account deposit flight that would undermine the banking system. 08/19 update: The bitcoin price and crypto market has swung wildly as fears swirl a widespread crypto market crash could be gathering pace. The bitcoin price dropped towards $113,000 before bouncing back to around $115,000, dragging down the wider crypto market that's seen $250 billion in value wiped out since last week. “Cryptocurrencies traded sharply lower,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments. “Bitcoin continued to pull back away from Thursday's all-time high just below $124,500. This week, the three-day Jackson Hole economic policy symposium begins in Wyoming, with Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's Friday speech topping the agenda as traders brace for what's widely expected to be a Fed interest rate cut in September. “Markets are shoring up their focus on upcoming commentary from the Fed chair at the Jackson Hole Symposium," Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, said in emailed comments. Last week, Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, mirroring a surprise 2024 interest rate cut that powered a bitcoin price boom into the November election. “If Powell signals a slower path to easing at Jackson Hole, markets could reprice aggressively, tightening financial conditions and putting pressure on crypto prices in the near term,” Carolane de Palmas, market analyst at Activtrades, said in emailed comments. On the flip side, if the Fed appears hesitant because of tariff-driven inflation concerns, bitcoin could remain trapped in consolidation until a clearer macro catalyst emerges. In the next quarter, bitcoin's path will be closely tied to Fed expectations.” In April, a Treasury Department report estimated that stablecoins could trigger up to $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows, depending on whether they can offer interest or yield, with the stablecoin market expected to grow to $2 trillion by 2028, up from $280 billion today. “Banks power the economy by turning deposits into loans. Tether's USDT remains the dominant stablecoin but is facing a tidal wave of competition from all angles, including Wall Street giants themselves, technology companies such as Facebook's Meta, as well as financial technology companies like PayPal and Stripe. Earlier this year, David Sacks, a technology investor and U.S. president Donald Trump's crypto czar, said on the All In Podcast he hosts with three other investors that he hopes that eventually the rules will swing in favor of stablecoin issuers, allowing them to directly offer interest to stablecoin holders. Trump's sons Eric and Don Jr have publicly said their World Liberty Financial crypto project is a direct challenge to Wall Street following their claims of being “de-banked” in the aftermath of Trump's 2020 election loss. “Honestly, I would love to see some of the big banks go extinct, because, honestly, they deserve it," Eric Trump said in May. The bitcoin price and crypto market's latest downturn, coming as just as traders celebrated a fresh all-time high, have raised fears the market could see further declines in coming weeks. “The crypto market continued its decline on Monday after a pause over the weekend,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro's chief market analyst, said in emailed comments. “The total capitalisation fell back to $3.88 trillion, reaching its lowest level in more than two weeks.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cardano, Shiba Inu have both seen renewed momentum in recent sessions. The cross-border payments project has now raised over $19.3 million, bringing it close to a major $20 million  milestone that will trigger its first centralized exchange listing reveal. Cardano is trading at $0.8804, up 11.58% in 24 hours, with a market cap of $31.35 billion. Its trading volume surged 103.06% to $2.52 billion, showing strong market interest. The SHIB market cap now sits at $8.15 billion, while trading volume has risen 36.23% to $335.42 million. The uptick adds to recent Shiba Inu News pointing toward steady retail participation. Both Cardano and SHIB are benefiting from the broader interest in top crypto under $1 assets and low cap crypto gems with high growth potential. Remittix (RTX) is quickly positioning itself as one of the best crypto project 2025 contenders. When the presale hits $20 million , Remittix will announce its first CEX listing, a key move to improve liquidity and accessibility. Its platform will allow users to send crypto directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries, with low gas fees and real-time FX conversion. A major update came with the announcement of its beta wallet launch planned for Q3 2025. This mobile-first wallet will integrate crypto staking, fiat withdrawals and support for 40+ cryptocurrencies, giving RTX a clear real-world utility edge over many upcoming crypto projects. With momentum building and whales reportedly buying RTX, the $20 million target is within reach. For investors tracking the next big altcoin 2025 or crypto solving real world problems, Remittix is shaping up as a serious contender. As Cardano, Shiba Inu and other established coins show signs of life, this new altcoin to watch is making its own headlines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Can interoperability survive the rise of branded rails? Fintech powerhouse Stripe is secretly building a high-performance blockchain called ‘Tempo', and Circle just announced its own stablecoin-centric chain, ‘Arc'. Stablecoins promise to make cryptocurrencies mainstream by delivering faster, cheaper, more interconnected global payments. Worse, market concentration may rise if a few players use stablecoins to reach previously unimaginable scale. Even when a technology has a decentralising force, economies of scale in complementary resources, brand or distribution inevitably drive concentration. The underlying internet protocols remained open and neutral, but massive digital platforms at the application layer walled off participants by strategically breaking interoperability. From email to social media to payments, we spend most of our time and money within the confines of what the tech giants have designed for us. Crypto's reason for existence was to break free from centralised intermediaries. After the 2008 financial crisis, Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to create a world where anyone could exchange value without having to trust a central bank or financial institution ever again. Inspired by bitcoin, entrepreneurs have applied the same principles to other digital platforms, including finance, marketplaces and social media. Progress towards decentralisation is mixed: while bitcoin allows anyone to be their own bank, most rely heavily on intermediaries for custody and use. Similarly, solutions that offer greater privacy and data controls have stayed niche. In payments, the most critical battle is unfolding now. Legacy infrastructure is siloed and incumbents have tremendous power over what we can access – and on what terms. Markets can become so concentrated that the public sector has to step in – the most salient example is China's introduction of a central bank digital currency to unravel the Ant Group and Tencent oligopoly. Crypto is a market-driven solution to this. It provides neutral and decentralised cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, as well as truly open financial rails. But as the technology has matured, two problems have emerged. To address this, the market has focused on fiat-backed stablecoins. Even Circle's Centre Consortium, with only two members, was dissolved and converted into a revenue-sharing agreement. Distributed ownership of a stablecoin ecosystem makes sense and is similar to what made Visa scale in the 1970s. To date, no joint project has delivered anything tangible. This is long-term problematic, and issuers have already started expanding their offerings to limit openness. Circle announced its own rails with Arc and payment network with the Circle Payments Network, placing it at the centre of how payments are executed – from defining rules and eligibility, to inserting itself into every transaction, to price and liquidity discovery, and collecting a fee. Put together, this setup is not that different from what allowed Visa and Mastercard to dominate for decades. To date, among networks at scale, that's been true only for the base layers of bitcoin, ethereum and solana. At most, that yields a few thousand transactions per second combined – a far cry from what global payments would require, even before you add financial services. As a result, most transactions no longer occur on the base layers (L1s) but on a sprawling ecosystem of high-throughput scaling solutions (L2s). While crypto purists might decry this trend, it aligns with economic theory: participants are willing to pay a premium for decentralisation and censorship resistance at the core settlement layer, yet they readily accept more centralisation to gain lower costs and faster speeds. This trade-off is broader than a user's decision to be their own bank. When building products, companies care deeply that the underlying network is decentralised. Essentially, they are willing to pay for neutrality to reduce the risk of expropriation – something that has repeatedly played out in digital platforms. To fully grasp what fast, low-cost L2s will do to competition, look no further than what the internet did to news and media: as the cost of distributing content fell to zero, business models evolved drastically, and massive aggregators (Google, Facebook, Spotify) emerged. Because L2s remove friction, offer convenience and allow builders to deliver better experiences, they are the obvious layer where value will be created – and appropriated. Furthermore, as money movement is commoditised, competition will shift to value-added services where new and legacy financial institutions have an advantage. Any regulated player can now use the technology to scale a truly global product. Based on how strong and persistent network effects have been, it's safe to assume that payments will gravitate towards a couple of permissionless blockchains. To counterbalance this, Circle is trying to both commoditise the rails – by issuing on multiple networks and placing itself in the middle with its cross-chain transfer protocol – and move activity to its network. In doing so, they may use stablecoins as a loss leader and issue domestic stablecoins to expand their advantage to foreign exchange markets and local use cases. As convenience and economic reality win over dogmatism, crypto will look very different. The good news is that it will be far more useful. And while that may come with more centralisation, the fact that the underlying protocols are open source means that, no matter how large some players may become, they face more pressure than under the status quo. It is also possible that, because crypto allows for new market design, the ultimate solution will be something the internet could not achieve because it lacked built-in monetisation mechanisms.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police Force Reprimanded After 96K Pieces of Video Evidence Deleted At the end of each shift, officers' BWV footage was uploaded and stored to a central hub which could be accessed and managed, along with all of SYP's digital evidence, via a secure system. Following an upgrade in May 2023, the secure system began to struggle processing BWV data and a local drive workaround was put in place. In August 2023, SYP identified that its BWV file storage was very low, and further investigation found that 96,174 pieces of original footage had been deleted from its system. Of those three cases, SYP states one may have progressed to the first court hearing if BWV had been available. However, as there was no additional independent evidence to prove the offence, progression to prosecution stage was already uncertain. The ICO‘s investigation found that SYP ultimately did not have the appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to keep evidence secure. This includes poor record keeping, not identifying the security risk in relation to transferring personal data between IT systems, and delaying the formulation of IT backup policies and not escalating to senior management when flaws were discovered. “This incident highlights the importance of having detailed policies and procedures in place to mitigate against the loss of evidence,” said Sally Anne Poole, head of investigations at the ICO. “People rightly have high expectations that our police forces and services, which protect us, also protect the personal information they hold.</p>
