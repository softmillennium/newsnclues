                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Washington Research Foundation today announced Orin Levine as its new president and CEO, effective Oct. 6. Levine has worked for more than 30 years in public health, innovation and philanthropy. Brooks Simpson, WRF's board chair, noted in a statement that Levine joins “at a time when state and federal budgets are being challenged.” That includes a revenue shortfall and spending cuts from Washington leaders, as well as Trump administration efforts to withhold and cancel funding from the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation, among others. “[Levine's] experience and exceptional leadership on the global healthcare stage will serve WRF and the region well as we navigate these uncharted waters,” Simpson said. She also thanked Daniel for his stewardship, noting that “WRF has become a widely recognized philanthropic organization in the region's life sciences space” during his tenure. He began his career as an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “I love innovation and WRF has a remarkable legacy of helping researchers turn bold ideas into innovations that improve lives,” Levine said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal appeals court handed SpaceX a win on Tuesday, in a ruling that prevents the National Labor Relations Board from prosecuting unfair labor practices against the company. The three-judge panel said being subjected to a possibly unconstitutional administrative proceeding, which is what SpaceX claimed, is an irreparable harm — so the pause continues. The NLRB brought the unfair labor practices claim against SpaceX after it fired a group of employees who signed an open letter criticizing CEO Elon Musk and a culture of sexism in the company. The panel included two judges appointed by President Donald Trump and a third judge appointed by George H.W.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Databricks, best known for its data analytics products, refrained from selling even more equity because it didn't need cash for operations after its once record-breaking $10 billion raise at a $62 billion valuation in January, according to the source. (OpenAI has since squashed the record with a $40 billion raise in March.) The round was co-led by both Thrive and one of Databricks' early investors, Insight Partners, TechCrunch has learned. These two firms led the last round as well. The company has now raised about $20 billion since it was founded in 2013. This was a primary round, meaning it didn't include employees selling their shares. However, sources close to the company say Databricks has already had two secondary rounds for employees in 2025. Those offers allowed employees to sell up to 40%, 50%, or 60% of their shares, depending on the size of their holdings. While Databricks clearly isn't in a hurry to IPO, employees have had two recent chances to cash out shares. This new round, however, was raised to pursue two specific projects — a database for AI agents and its AI agent platform — Databricks co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi told TechCrunch in an interview. The company will invest heavily in its database for AI agents, making it generally available to all customers. It launched the product, known as Lakebase, in June at its annual tech conference. “The database market is $105 billion of TAM [total addressable market], of revenue, sitting there, kind of unaffected in the last 40 years,” Ghodsi told TechCrunch, giving a subtle nod to how database giant Oracle has had a lock on the market for decades. For the first time, they were created by AI agents. And this year, the statistic is 80%,” he said, adding that he predicts this stat to increase to 99% of new databases within a year. As for how Lakebase will differentiate from Supabase and others already building Postgres-based databases for agents, Ghodsi said the key is “separated compute and storage.” They just spin up lots of databases, much faster than humans can, but you don't want to go bankrupt because you're doing that,” he explained. Rather than artificial general math geniuses or cancer-curing scientists, what companies need are agents that can reliably handle, unaided, mundane tasks like onboarding employees or answering personalized questions about HR benefits. He believes that such focus will give Agent Bricks a competitive advantage. “As you know, it's pretty expensive to hire AI talent right now,” he said, smiling.

Their demos showed examples such as the ability to generate product descriptions, clean messy data by extracting names and phone numbers, and explain complex Excel formulas in plain English. The move reflects broader attempts by Microsoft and other tech giants, including Google, Adobe, Salesforce and others, to refresh legacy apps with AI features. Previous integrations of AI into Excel focused on explaining complex formulas or suggesting data visualizations from the sidelines, acting more as a helpful guide than an active co-worker in the grid. Microsoft says the feature is rolling out now on Excel for Windows and Mac to Beta Channel users with Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses and recent versions of the software.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's going green for the sake of the planet, and then there's going green as part of a policy initiative that winds up buying a bunch of glitch-plagued electric vehicles from a company that went bankrupt and can no longer service them. The latter is the exact story of a New York-based company called American Lease, which has spent around $45 million for 2,800 cars from Fisker, a now-dead EV startup that only made 11,000 of that model in its short life anyway, and is now using them as part of NYC's Green Rides Initiative. They have accordingly deployed the Ocean, a sort of Escalade SUV knockoff, across NYC as a ride-sharing or car service vehicle, meaning that the only Ocean you may ever see in your life is popping up multiple times throughout New York. And in true tech bro fashion, the decision to buy these almost 3,000 now-defunct SUVs for millions of dollars was made fast—and broke things, possibly literally. “We were sitting at lunch and I was reading an article about how Henrik Fisker, who founded Fisker, had listed his home for more than the market cap of the company at that point,” American Lease executive vice president Josh Bleiberg told Bloomberg. Fisker produced over 10,000 Ocean SUVs in 2023, but only 4,929 of these vehicles were delivered to customers. “A door that fails to open can prevent occupants from exiting in an emergency, increasing the risk of injury,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in its findings. A Bloomberg reporter who recently took a ride in one noted that you should definitely look out for the “ghost light”—which randomly goes on and then blinks for 10 to 15 seconds before resetting—or California Mode, which sometimes causes the windows to get stuck in the down position and then have to be reset at the company's Bronx site. The vehicles are often old, with their software in limbo, managed by third-party startups like indiGO Technologies, who are trying to keep them up-to-date. No word on how you'd fix a major problem with an Ocean, because the company that made it is dead, and it was the only model Fisker ever made. That led to accusations of “bricking,” which is when an EV becomes totally unresponsive. To be fair, American Leasing did get a good deal on the Fisker cars. Whether that price factored in the recall issues or repair costs, though, isn't clear. American Leasing did not respond to a request for comment. What's remarkable is that New York's push for an all-electric fleet—enforced by the city's Green Rides initiative—has inadvertently created a marketplace for these zombie EV startups. The city aims for all Uber and Lyft rides to be emissions-free by 2030, but limited supply and declining federal incentives have left fleet operators scrambling for affordable replacements, often turning to used and propped-up vehicles from bankrupt or failing companies. “We don't anticipate these cars lasting much past 150,000 to 200,000 miles,” Bleiberg told Bloomberg.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As legal cannabis has expanded around the United States for both recreational and medical use, companies have amassed troves of data about customers and their transactions. For some patients in Ohio who use medical weed, a recent data exposure could impact their sensitive information. Security researcher Jeremiah Fowler found a publicly accessible database in mid-July that appeared to contain medical records, mental health evaluations, physician reports, and images of IDs like driver's licenses for people seeking medical cannabis cards. The 323-GB trove stored close to a million records, including Social Security numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, dates of birth, and medical data—all organized by name. Ohio Medical Alliance did not answer WIRED's questions about Fowler's findings. At one point, though, the company's president, Cassandra Brooks, wrote in an email: “I need time to investigate this alleged incident. We take data security very seriously and are looking into this matter.” “There were physicians' reports that would say what the underlying problem was—whether it was anxiety, cancer, HIV, or something else. And I even saw offender release cards, which are basically IDs for people who just got out of prison that they submitted as proof of identity to get a medical marijuana card.” One CSV plaintext document called “staff comments” appeared to be an export of internal communications, appointment histories, notes about clients, and application status. That file also contained more then 200,000 email addresses of Ohio Medical Alliance employees, business associates, and customers. Databases that are misconfigured and have inadvertently been left publicly exposed on the open internet are a common problem online in spite of efforts to raise awareness about the mistake and its privacy implications.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Come September, players will be able to rent out a server worth 100GB or more to play whatever game they want, so long as they already own it. But if you were feeling antsy about how much that new PC upgrade or future console could cost, a $20-per-month sub may seem like a bargain in comparison. When the service is up and running, any compatible games can then be downloaded to a remote PC and played during a single session. Nvidia said it will allow users to effectively rent out 200GB of persistent cloud storage starting at $3 extra per month. Microsoft has made similar moves recently with Xbox Game Pass service. There are other streaming services like Shadow PC, which allow you to effectively rent out a remote PC and operate it like your own, but those can cost between $38 and $50 per month. If the streaming quality holds up, Nvidia's Install to Play, plus the already sizable library of games available to stream, could effectively max out your PC games library. Nvidia also plans to release a specific app for the Legion Go S handheld with SteamOS. There are several major changes coming for those who subscribe to the GeForce Now Ultimate subscription. Everybody spending $20 a month will be able to access 4K resolution at 120 fps on LG TVs and RTX 5080-level graphics capabilities through the cloud, a jump up from the previous RTX 4080. The new GPU will be hosted on Nvidia's servers at no additional cost to users. Finally, users will be able to play games at 5K resolutions. Essentially, the mode promises even better visuals than what you normally get with streaming. For those enjoying 100 Mbps download speeds, in-game trees will no longer look like a pixelated collage of stems and leaves. Streaming has the tendency to wash out colors and make details less distinct. Nvidia claims Cinematic quality mode will even make in-game HUDs and menus more legible. The mode could result in more accurate colors for games that support HDR, or high dynamic range, for better contrast between darks and lights. SDR content will still look better, but to a lesser degree. Nvidia has a bad habit of showing off multi-frame gen capabilities on its GPUs and comparing the improvements to older graphics cards. Multi-frame gen is a technique where the GPU can insert multiple generated frames in between two rendered frames, increasing the overall responsiveness of a game. Yes, a GPU doing twice as much frame gen will result in higher frame counts, if that's the only thing you care about. Frame generation also introduces latency between what you're seeing on screen and what's rendered by the graphics processing pipeline. Latency can be a real killer for game streaming, but Nvidia told Gizmodo it upgraded the CPU and memory in its SuperPOD servers with new technology, which will offset frame gen latency. Nvidia also changed its formula for data packets, the unit of data formatted for telecommunication networks, to “intelligently,” which will result in fewer dropped packets. The company is working with major telecom companies like CableLabs and Comcast, as well as T-Mobile and its L4S network, for this new data technique. GeForce Now still can't completely replace a console or PC, not when the service is so dependent on your home internet speeds. Late last year, Nvidia added support for 1440p streaming and the ability to save graphics settings between games. The company has yet to raise streaming prices, but when every major streaming service's prices are ballooning every year, you shouldn't expect to keep shelling out the same amount for much longer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After some major leaks earlier this month, Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 FE are finally here, and on paper, they look like a pretty good deal. While the “FE” moniker, short for Fan Edition, often signifies a lower price point in exchange for some compromises on features, the new Galaxy Buds 3 FE actually beats Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro in a couple of key areas, and one of those battlegrounds is battery life. According to Samsung, the $150 Buds 3 FE offer 6 hours of battery with active noise cancellation (ANC) activated and 8.5 hours with ANC off. I would have liked to see the ANC battery life get a bump here too, but it's nice to know that if you need to, you can get an extra hour and a half for less money. Those battery life numbers aren't mind-blowing in the general field of wireless earbuds, but they do put the Galaxy Buds 3 FE on par with comparably priced buds from OnePlus. These wireless earbuds are actually 5 grams lighter than the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, which isn't an enormous difference but is enough to give the FE a slight edge if you're comparing the two against each other. It's also worth noting that Samsung managed to decrease the weight while upgrading the battery life, which is always a feat worth mentioning when it comes to any gadget, earbuds included. There is a slight difference here in that the Galaxy Buds FE 3 come with a matte finish as opposed to the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro's glossy one, though, and they don't have any LED lights on the stems—sorry, blades—themselves. On top of a similar design, the Galaxy Buds FE 3 also come equipped with real-time AI translation features (only if you have a Samsung phone) and hands-free Gemini compatibility so you can activate and use your voice assistant without unlocking your phone. AI features probably won't be make-or-break for most people, but it's nice to know that they'll be there if you should need/want them. It's hard to say what kind of difference that will make without hearing them back-to-back, but I'm guessing the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro will have an edge when it comes to fidelity and dynamic range. Even with that difference, however, the Buds 3 FE feel like a good deal for the price, and if you're looking to save a little bit of money but not make any major compromises, this could be the pair of Samsung wireless earbuds you're looking for.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI is reportedly on the verge of a roughly $500 billion valuation, a figure that would make it the most valuable private company in the world—bigger than SpaceX, TikTok's parent company Bytedance, and even public giants like Palantir. As Axios reports, there are actually two deals in play: a SoftBank-led round valuing the company at $300 billion, which won't close until year's end, and a secondary sale of employee shares at a far steeper $500 billion valuation. Most of the cheaper shares have already been snapped up, leaving investors to fight over the pricier ones. “The outcomes continue to get bigger than people think.” “That alone would support a trillion-and-a-half-dollar company, which is a pretty good return, just thinking about ChatGPT,” the investor says. Today, ChatGPT has 700 million weekly active users—and fewer than 10 percent of them pay for it. The investor's projections are ambitious, and they seem to discount the threat of major players like Google or Meta eating OpenAI's lunch. “The half-a-trillion-dollar question now is, to what extent will OpenAI be able to retain the customers it has acquired, and simultaneously be able to bring its costs to a point where it can, in fact, monetize at [hypothetically] $5 per user per month,” says Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. For investors buying in at $500 billion, “they're expecting an IPO above a trillion in two to three years, otherwise the rate of return does not justify the investment,” says Glenn Okun, who's also a business professor at NYU. In the first seven months of 2025, the company doubled its projected annual revenue to $12 billion, which suggests OpenAI is bringing in about $1 billion per month. Enterprise adoption has surged, too, reaching 5 million paying business users this month. To the investor, these are signs of a company with the momentum to win: “People don't like unprecedented things, because most people like to pattern-match,” the investor says. “Everything this company has done has been unprecedented, from the pace of its revenue growth to the AI technology.” But OpenAI's spending is ballooning alongside its revenue. It's reportedly expecting a cash burn of $8 billion this year, and Altman said at a recent dinner in San Francisco that much of OpenAI's infrastructure costs are for inference, as opposed to training—and he expects the startup to spend trillions of dollars on data centers in the “not very distant future.” That means in the fantastical future where ChatGPT may have billions of users, it would cost trillions of dollars to serve them. It's extraordinarily expensive to scale such a power-hungry technology. Even if the chips get faster and cheaper, the overall costs grow as the company works to train even bigger models and serve them to a growing user base sending off billions of queries, Sundararajan tells me. The investor, however, brushes off profitability concerns, saying OpenAI can spread those massive costs across its entire user base. “It is not cheap, and it's not for the faint of heart in terms of investment,” they add. “What we're looking at here is major capital investment with the sorts of valuations that may be very hard to to actually reach,” he says. Private-market pricing reflects what a small number of investors are willing to pay for a small number of shares. “In all likelihood, it's an approximation,” Okun says of the valuation. Right now, investors appear to have a nearly insatiable appetite for AI startups. According to recent PitchBook data, a third of all venture dollars in the second quarter of this year went to five companies—all in the AI space—which is more than double the spending in 2024. But in classic Altman fashion, he reminded attendees that's actually a good thing: “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” he said. “If you look at most of the bubbles in history [like] the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Startup valuations have always reflected how well the CEO can sell a vision. Meanwhile, investors are betting that ChatGPT becomes as indispensable as Google, that billions of people happily pay to use it, and competitors quietly fade into irrelevance. Whether any of that actually happens almost doesn't matter. For now, the story is worth half a trillion all on its own. “There's definitely risk in it,” the investor tells me.

The public-private partnership comes at no cost to taxpayers, CLEAR said in a news release on Tuesday. The automated eGates — available to CLEAR+ members who opt in — are designed to conduct real-time biometric verification, matching a traveler's facial image with their identity document and boarding pass. CLEAR says that it transmits only limited data (live photo, boarding pass, ID photo used for enrollment and identity information), and that it has no access to watchlists, cannot override TSA gate decisions, and does not manually open gates. More than 20 million international visitors are expected to fly to the U.S. for the World Cup soccer tournament next year, and Seattle is hosting six matches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Director Masahiro Sakurai announced the news in a Nintendo Direct that aired today, alongside a detailed look at the upcoming racing game. Air Riders expands on the original, which came out in 2003, with more characters, modes, and new controls beyond the single button players used to boost. “Unfortunately.” While the original game featured different versions of Kirby to play, Air Riders adds King Dedede, Meta Knight, and even lesser known characters like Starman, all of which can use copy abilities like Kirby. Each character has a special move that can boost their speed, attack other racers, or activate abilities like turning into a giant snowball. The game allows up to eight human players locally or 16 online. In addition to traditional races, Air Riders features City Trial mode, where players will need to upgrade their rides as quickly as possible by gathering power-ups, stealing new machines, and attacking opponents. Random field events will give players the chance to join and play short races and battles; players have only five minutes to upgrade their machines as much as possible before entering Stadiums, where the main competitions take place. The game is being developed with Bandai Namco Studios and Sora LTD—teams that worked on Super Smash Bros. Ultimate—instead of longtime Kirby developer HAL Laboratory. Sakurai, creator of both Kirby and the Super Smash Bros. series, has had his hand in a few projects over the past few years. In addition to wrapping up work on Super Smash Bros. Today, he confirmed that project is Kirby Air Riders. Kirby Air Riders joins a fairly light first-party launch lineup for Switch 2 and is the second major racing game to launch this year for the console, following Mario Kart World. Nintendo is expected to announce more details, including the game's price, later this year. A hands-on demo will be playable at PAX West in Seattle August 29–September 1.

"Would you like to access sensitive information?" might be the new "Would you like fries with that?" A security researcher called "BobDaHacker" has just revealed how he went from scoring free McNuggets via the fast food chain's mobile app to repeatedly gaining access to a McDonald's platform meant only for employees and franchisees. "The McDonald's Feel-Good Design Hub is their central platform for brand assets and marketing materials - used by teams and agencies across 120 countries. It used to be 'protected' by a client-side password. "After I reported this, they took 3 months to implement a proper account system with different login paths for McDonald's employees (using their EID/MCID) and external partners ... Now, I'll be the first to admit that security reporters are often quick to condemn organizations that fail to address vulnerabilities approximately five minutes after their disclosure, even though very few of us have ever needed to develop and deploy software at the scale of a multi-billion-dollar corporation. But it's hard to believe McDonald's is taking the security of its "Feel-Good Design Hub" seriously when it takes an entire quarter to resolve a problem... only to have the fix bypassed by changing a single word in a URL. Even that might be excused because, again, developing and deploying software at scale is difficult. But then BobDaHacker went on to point out that simply registering a new account prompted the Feel-Good Design Hub to send the password associated with that account in plain-text, even though we as a society have known better than that for decades at this point. And that wasn't even the most embarrassing thing about McDonald's security processes revealed in BobDaHacker's blog post! "McDonald's HAD a security.txt file with contact info. I literally called McDonald's HQ and started dropping random security employee names I found on LinkedIn," Bob said. So I kept calling, saying random security employee names until finally someone important enough called me back and gave me an actual place to report these issues." Bob said that McDonald's appeared to fix "most of the vulnerabilities" they disclosed, but the company also let go of Bob's friend, who helped them investigate some of the vulnerabilities and "never established a proper security reporting channel." (I couldn't find a security.txt file on the company's website, and a search for "McDonald's security disclosure" doesn't return any relevant results, either.) That seems ill-advised, given that other researchers would probably give up on trying to disclose vulnerabilities long before Bob did. Having to search on LinkedIn and repeatedly call a hotline is not ideal. Now we know BobDaHacker was able to use the Feel-Good Design Hub to access a variety of resources, from "highly confidential and proprietary" marketing information to a service that could be used to "search for ANY McDonald's employee globally" and see their email address, among other things.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eaton Z made sure Intel had closed up all the unearthed security gaps before divulging this research. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. It was possible to download sensitive information about 270,000 Intel employees until the end of February, according to Eaton Z, a security researcher, reverse engineer, and application developer. All this information was available with a little 'valid user' dodge applied to the Intel India Operations (IIO) site, where employees usually order their business cards. Moreover, the business card site was just one of four found with gaping security flaws. With the headlining result, Eaton's preliminary instincts proved accurate. It is sometimes possible “to trick an application into thinking a valid user is logged in by modifying the getAllAccounts function to return a non-empty array,” Eaton narrated. Indeed, this worked and got Eaton past the login screen. Next, it was observed that the website, at this depth, allowed for the probing of a long list of employees, not restricted to India, but worldwide. Subsequently, Eaton was alarmed by the amount of information that could be pulled up about every employee. “Way more than this simple website would ever need,” they commented, “Intel's APIs are very generous!” Removing the URL filter from the API being probed eventually yielded “a nearly 1GB JSON file.” Inside this download, Eaton noted that there were details of every Intel employee (there are fewer now). Data included fields like each employee's name, role, manager, phone number, and mailing address. Perhaps you will be surprised to hear that three other vulnerable Intel Outside style hacks were possible? Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. On the internal ‘Product Hierarchy' website, Eaton discovered easily decryptable hardcoded credentials. Similarly, Intel's internal ‘Product Onboarding' suffered from easily decryptable hardcoded credentials. The corporate login on Intel's SEIMS Supplier Site was another security measure that could be bypassed. Eaton communicated with Intel, outlining the internal website flaws that had been discovered, starting from October 2024. Sadly, none of Eaton's work qualified for Intel bug bounty payouts, as it was excluded by some small print. Perhaps even worse, Eaton only got a single canned ‘auto-response' from Intel throughout the whole process. Publishing the linked blog on August 18, thus, seems eminently reasonable.

Nvidia has dropped the prices for some of its RTX 50-series GPUs in Europe, with the RTX 5090, 5080, and 5070 seeing a reduction of almost 10%. As noted by Videocardz, these lower prices are likely tied to a weakening dollar, making the import of American goods into Europe relatively cheaper than before. The USD was at its peak when Nvidia's latest gaming GPUs launched, with the exchange rate hovering around $1.04 for every Euro. Today, it now sits at around $1.16 — a more than 10% drop in value since January. This also holds true for other European Nvidia sites, like France, Belgium, and Spain. Hopefully, other manufacturers will soon follow suit, as they haven't reduced prices at the time of writing. The lowered prices are a welcome change for European gamers and enthusiasts, especially as it's been proven that almost all GPUs are being sold way above MSRP — especially for the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080. We often see GPU prices drop several months after they launch. There's also the threat of additional import taxes, with President Donald Trump announcing a 100% semiconductor tariff in early August. It's also been reported that he's considering increasing this further to 300% after the U.S. Department of Commerce's Section 232 investigation. These tariffs might not affect Europe, though, if Nvidia can build GPUs for the continent outside of America, or if it's able to completely assemble the RTX 50-series graphics cards within the United States without relying on any kind of import.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cheaper energy bills are a nonpartisan issue—no matter where you live. Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act repealed most of the clean energy incentives in former president Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. Meanwhile, his EPA administrator moved to revoke the endangerment finding, the legal basis for federal oversight of greenhouse gases. For those of us who have been following policy developments in this area closely, nearly every day brings a new blow to past efforts to salvage our climate and to build the clean energy economy of the future. MIT Technology Review's guest opinion series, offering expert commentary on legal, political and regulatory issues related to climate change and clean energy. The answer, I would argue, is to return to state capitals—a policymaking venue that climate and renewable energy advocates already know well. This can be done strategically, focusing on a handful of key states rather than all fifty. Yes, shifting away from carbon-spewing resources is about slowing down climate change, and for some this is the single most important motivation for pursuing it. But it also can be about much more. The case can be made just as forcefully—and perhaps more effectively—that shifting to clean energy advances affordability at a time when electricity bills are skyrocketing. It promotes energy freedom by resisting monopolistic utilities' ownership and gatekeeping of the grid. It increases reliability as battery storage reaches new heights and renewable sources and baseload power plants like nuclear or natural gas facilities (some of which we certainly do and will need) increasingly complement one another. Talking about clean energy policy in these ways is safer from ideological criticisms of “climate alarmism.” Research reported in my forthcoming book, Owning the Green Grid, shows that this framing has historically been effective in red states. In addition, using the arguments above to promote all forms of energy can allow clean energy proponents to reclaim a talking point deployed in a previous era by the political right: a true “all-of-the-above” approach to energy policy. But combining them enhances overall grid performance, delivering more than the sum of their individual parts. Its policies have picked winners (coal, oil, and natural gas) and losers (solar and wind) among energy technologies—ironically, given conservative claims of blue states having done so in the past. To be sure, the Trump-led Republican party has taken such extreme measures that it will constrain certain state policymaking possibilities. But there are a variety of other ways to continue to make state-level progress on greenhouse gas emissions. State and local advocacy efforts are nothing new for the clean energy community. But in recent years, some have suggested that Democratic state governments are a necessary prerequisite to making meaningful state-level progress. Struggling to pay your utility bill is nonpartisan. Even before renewable energy was as cheap as it is today, early progress at diversifying energy portfolios was made in conservative states. Iowa, Texas, and Montana were all early adopters of renewable portfolio standards. Advocates in such places did not lead with messaging about climate change, but rather about economic development and energy independence. These policy efforts paid off: The deeply red Lone Star State, for instance, generates more wind energy than any other state and ranks only behind California in producing solar power. So, in the face of a national government that is choosing last century's energy technologies as policy winners and this century's technologies as policy losers, the states offer clean energy advocates a familiar terrain on which to make continued progress, if they tailor their selling points to the reality on the ground. Joshua A. Basseches is the David and Jane Flowerree Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies and Public Policy at Tulane University. His research focuses on state-level renewable energy politics and policymaking, especially in the electricity sector. The tech giant just signed a deal to buy fusion power. Can the vast and sparsely populated African country translate its renewable power potential into national development?
