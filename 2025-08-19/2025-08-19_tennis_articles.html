                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The post Iga Swiatek rallies for 1st Cincinnati Open title right after Wimbledon win appeared first on ClutchPoints. After a long title drought that spanned over a full year, Iga Swiatek is back to dominating like tennis fans are used to seeing. After the 24-year old collected her sixth Grand Slam title with a phenomenal performance to win Wimbledon last month, she has now won her 11th WTA 1000 title at the Cincinnati Open. With that victory, Swiatek improves to 6-0 all-time against Paolini, dropping just one set in the process. That court position combined with her occasionally attackable serve puts her at a disadvantage in the serve-return dynamic on faster courts. Świątek reversed that trend at Wimbledon, and did so in Cincinnati as well. “I'm kind of shocked and super happy, so thank you for the awesome support, to the team and to my family back home.” Swiatek is now up to 18 big titles in total, adding her 11 WTA 1000 trophies to her six majors and one victory at the WTA Finals. She has won seven of the 10 different WTA 1000 tournaments after adding Cincinnati to her collection, and is now only missing victories in Wuhan, Canada and Dubai to complete the full collection. She passes American Coco Gauff, who drops to No. Swiatek made it to New York just in time for the U.S. Open mixed doubles on Tuesday morning, where she played her first match about 16 hours after finishing the final in Cincinnati.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brian Vahaly doesn't know his life without tennis. During his seven-year pro career, he reached a career-high ranking of World No. In 2017, a decade after retiring due to a rotator cuff injury, he became the first current or former ATP Tour player to come out as gay. Last November, he was elected for a two-year term as the chairman of the board and president of the United States Tennis Association, joining Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova as highly visible LGBTQ sports figures. A self-described “very private person,” Vahaly said he had made peace with the fact that he was never going to come out publicly, despite being open about his sexuality with his family and friends. But six months after he and his partner, Bill Jones, became parents to twin boys via surrogacy, Vahaly had a change of heart. It's not about you anymore,” Vahaly, 46, told NBC News. While his announcement was met with some support — multiple top players, including Roger Federer, said an openly queer player would be “totally accepted” in the men's locker room — Vahaly recalled receiving thousands of hateful messages about his young family. “There was a lot of feedback I received about raising kids into this world, having kids without a mother,” Vahaly said. As feelings hit my mind, anything that felt not beneficial to my career was quickly compartmentalized and pushed to the side,” he said. “Back in those days, if I thought about a gay bar and what it meant to be gay, and I would see those people publicly, I thought to myself, ‘That is not me. Part of that emotional work included unpacking his experience of undergoing so-called conversion therapy at a church, where he was told repeatedly that his attraction to men was a kind of “horrible defect” that could be cured by God. In retrospect, Vahaly said, he wasted years trying to change an immutable part of himself. In his second act, Vahaly has held senior executive positions at Washington, D.C.-based venture capital and investment management firms. But about five years after stepping away from tennis, he was asked to serve on the USTA's board. Fortunately, the guy who was recruiting me knew me quite well and knew how to tap into my competitive side,” Vahaly recalled with a laugh. Women's tennis has historically had many openly gay players — including King, Navratilova and most recently Russian-born Australian Daria Kasatkina. But only one men's player has followed in Vahaly's footsteps: Brazil's Joao Lucas Reis da Silva, who reached a career high of No. While there is now greater cultural acceptance of the LGBTQ community, Vahaly pointed out there are still a number of factors preventing male players — like his younger self — from wanting to come out, including the potential financial fallout from sponsors and the reality that the tour still travels to countries where being gay is neither legal nor accepted. “The new generation thinks about inclusion and about being themselves so differently than my generation, so I'm hopeful that [homophobic] language starts to fall away a little bit, that people in our community feel accepted into sport,” he said. Now, as an LGBTQ leader in sports, Vahaly still faces some casual homophobia. “There are still rooms where my profile is shared, but they leave out the fact that I'm gay or I'm a dad,” he said. But, “sometimes, shouting from the rooftops your beliefs or being really firm and in your face is not the right approach.” “Those are tough rooms, sometimes, when people aren't used to seeing a gay family, but I think humanizing people in our community is actually what drives us forward,” he continued. “I'm not trying to push something down anybody's throat. I'm simply trying to show how and why we're actually not that different. Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has targeted diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and rolled back legal protections for LGBTQ people, particularly those who are transgender. (The Grand Slam will host its fifth annual Open Pride day on Aug. “What I can do is be honest about myself and take part in interviews like this to continue to show and demonstrate to the world the diversity that exists within our sport and that they should feel welcome. I want people to know and see that this is a safe place for them.” Max Gao is a freelance entertainment and sports journalist based in Toronto.</p>

The new mixed doubles event in New York sees a host of top singles players compete for a $1m prize Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. The new-look US Open mixed doubles event starts today, with Carlos Alcaraz set to feature alongside Emma Raducanu amongst a star-studded list of pairs. New for 2025, the mixed doubles in New York will be staged on the two biggest courts – Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong – over Tuesday 19 August and Wednesday 20 August. As well as five-time Grand Slam winner Alcaraz and 2021 US Open champion Raducanu, a host of other top names are competing alongside one another for the $1m champion prize - an increase of $800,000 from 2024. The top-seeded pair features British No 1 Jack Draper alongside Jessica Pegula – they face Alcaraz and Raducanu in the round-of-16. Novak Djokovic is also playing with Serbian compatriot Olga Danilovic, but Jannik Sinner and Katerina Siniakova have withdrawn a day after the men's World No 1 retired from the Cincinnati Open final against Alcaraz with illness. The mixed doubles event takes place on Tuesday 19 August and Wednesday 20 August on the two biggest show courts at Flushing Meadows, Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong. Matches start at 11am local time, that's 4pm BST. Alcaraz and Raducanu's match against Draper and Pegula is scheduled third on Arthur Ashe on Tuesday, around 2pm local time - 7pm BST. The scoring system, until the final, will be best-of-three sets played to four games with sudden death deuce and a tie-break at 4-4, with a 10-point tiebreak instead of the third set if necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Croatia's women's singles medallist speaks to Olympics.com a year on from her historic podium finish at Paris 2024. The Croatian tennis player had to overcome countless hurdles in the buildup to last year's Olympic Games, suffering from so much physical discomfort that she contemplated pulling out. Vekić candidly remembers her illness in the buildup to Paris, where she endured pain in both her arm and ankle. “I have the scrunchie that I wore in the final,” Vekić tells Olympics.com of her keepsakes from her successful Games a year ago. I have a lot of merchandise at home from Paris." Watch and read the full highlights with your Olympic membership. Both the medal and scrunchie sit proudly in her apartment in Monte Carlo, with little proving more meaningful to the 29-year-old than the Olympic silver, Croatia's first medal in Olympic women's singles tennis history. With four WTA career titles, the Osijek native had never reached a final on clay before Paris 2024. By her own admission, she is not fond of the red surface - “I'm not the biggest fan of clay, so it always feels good coming back on grass,” she admits. Arriving in Paris after a maiden Grand Slam semi-final appearance at Wimbledon 2024, Vekić had only once made it into the second week of the clay major at Roland-Garros, where Olympic tennis was held. The Women's Singles Tennis Final was held at Court Philippe-Chatrier, on 03/08/24. After two hours of play, Qinwen Zheng (CHN) won the Gold. Zheng (CHN) claimed victory over Donna Vekic (CRO) 6:2, 6:3. Vekić explains, “After having such a good run at Wimbledon I had a lot of confidence going to the Olympics. I was very tired and not thinking too much, just playing my game. The Croatian overcame former US Open champion Bianca Andreescu before stunning second seed and another Grand Slam winner in Coco Gauff in the third round. Though played on Court Philippe-Chatrier, this was not an extension of the French Open by any means. “It was a lot warmer, the balls were different, everything helped a little - and playing for your country it's different as well.” “That's very far, let's see about LA,” she responds to the possibility of competing at a third Olympic Games, having debuted at Tokyo 2020 back in 2021. She knows that she will be even more invested in her fashion endeavours by then, from the Olympic flame to her own flame.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner has withdrawn from the U.S. Open mixed doubles, which begins Aug. 19 in New York. 1 in singles retired after five games of his Cincinnati Open final against Carlos Alcaraz due to illness, and will recover before preparing for the U.S. Open singles. Americans Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison then took the pair's spot as first alternate, owing to their combined singles ranking. Alcaraz traveled from Mason, Ohio to partner Emma Raducanu, while Iga Świątek, who won the WTA 1000 title with victory over Jasmine Paolini, also arrived on time to partner Norway's Casper Ruud. The new mixed doubles event, which will be played over two days and feature short sets, an array of singles stars and a $1 million prize, begins at 11 a.m. Aug. 19. Jessica Pegula / Jack Draper Iga Świątek / Casper Ruud Elena Rybakina / Taylor Fritz Amanda Anisimova / Holger Rune Belinda Bencic / Alexander Zverev Mirra Andreeva / Daniil Medvedev Madison Keys / Frances Tiafoe Karolina Muchová / Andrey Rublev Danielle Collins / Christian Harrison Emma Raducanu / Carlos Alcaraz Olga Danilović / Novak Djokovic Taylor Townsend / Ben Shelton Sara Errani / Andrea Vavassori Venus Williams / Reilly Opelka Naomi Osaka / Gael Monfils Caty McNally / Lorenzo Musetti In Jannik Sinner and Kateřina Siniaková, the U.S. Open had unwittingly stumbled upon a fascinating mixed doubles pairing. Sinner's withdrawal, and the end of his partnership with Siniaková before it had begun, is perhaps a fitting conclusion to his involvement in the competition. When Sinner was asked at Wimbledon about how his partnership with Navarro had come about, he could have tried to play it straight and trot out some line like: “Yeah, look, I've always admired Emma as a player and I really can't wait to play the mixed doubles event with her in New York.” Instead he started laughing and told the truth: “It was very unexpected, to be honest. We never texted to each other.” He explained that with other pairs partnered up, the U.S. Open had suggested her as one of a few options. Fast forward nearly two months, and Sinner's withdrawal is not a major surprise. Now the U.S. Open has been left to scramble for a replacement for Sinner, and has lost arguably its most interesting pair in the process. There was always likely to be a degree of chopping and changing, and some has happened already with other partnerships, but this will no doubt provide more fuel for those who are sceptical about the seriousness of this event.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An illness caused top-ranked men's player Jannik Sinner to retire from the Cincinnati Open final against his rival Carlos Alcaraz on Monday after just 23 minutes of tennis. He was expected to then travel to New York and play alongside 11-time Grand Slam doubles champion Katerina Siniakova — most recently in the 2025 Wimbledon mixed doubles — in the first round of the new-look 2025 U.S. Open mixed doubles. With less than five hours to go to his match's 3:00 pm ET start time, Sinner officially backed out. Alcaraz, meanwhile, still plans to play alongside his partner, Emma Raducanu. Eurosport confirmed that Sinner was battling a 100.4 degree Fahrenheit fever entering Monday's final — the combined high temperatures in Cincinnati certainly didn't help. From yesterday, I didn't feel great. "I tried to come out, to make it at least a small match, but I couldn't handle more....I am very sorry for all of you. I know that maybe some of you, on a Monday, you had to work or do something else, so I'm really sorry." Sinner, a four-time Grand Slam champion in singles before the age of 23, doesn't quite boast the same resume in doubles. He owns a 3-2 doubles record in the Davis Cup and has one ATP 250 title: the 2021 Atlanta Open with doubles-specialist Reilly Opelka (playing the 2025 US Open with Venus Williams). The Czech 29-year-old has 10 Grand Slam women's doubles wins and expanded her portfolio to mixed doubles in the last year, winning both the 2024 Olympic gold and Wimbledon in 2025. She reached the 2022 Wimbledon women's doubles semifinals. Harrison, her partner, is a much more accomplished doubles player. The Express uses notifications to keep you updated</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ATP Tour has witnessed many iconic players retire from tennis in very recent times, one of whom was Andy Murray. His fellow legend Rafael Nadal also set down his racket last season, while fellow icon Diego Schwartzman retired from tennis earlier in 2025. Joining him this season have been the likes of veteran players Richard Gasquet, Fabio Fognini and Fernando Verdasco among others. And they have now been joined in retirement by Kyle Edmund, who has decided to call time on his career aged just 30.

And unfortunately they have now also led to his retirement from the sport, in which he turned pro back in 2012. He met Murray four times during his career, with the Scot winning on three occasions and losing on the other. Edmund has certainly left a positive mark on the game, as proven by further warm messages he's received since retiring. Just the beginning,” with her fellow WTA icon Caroline Garcia noting: “Congrats on an amazing effort.” Along with his two career titles, which arrived at Antwerp and New York in 2018 and 2020 respectively, Edmund lost the 2018 Marrekech final.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Updates from the opening day action at Flushing Meadows Brilliant net-coverage from Vavassori earns a chance to break back immediately at 30-4,0 and when Rublev nets, he and Errani have it. They've by far the most at stake here: this is their bread and butter, the money is much bigger for them, and they're repping for dubs specialists. We're away again on Armstrong, Rublev raising break point with an overhead then returning hard; Errani moves out of the road but the ball is good, so he and Muchova lead the champs 1-0 with a break. Swiatek says she's played Ruud in the United Cup so has a good idea of where to be on the court; Ruud notes that Swiatek is on the winning train and he's just jumping on. They'll now share notes on McNally and Musetti, the match due on court in a matter of minutes. The winners look a good team and meet McNally/Musetti shortly. Muchova, though, is a good doubles player with the dexterity and power to become an even better one. News reaches me that, in the locker room last week, Fritz said there was no chance he'd lose to a doubles player in mixed doubles. Regular readers of this blog will know she's a favourite – Muchova too – and down 15-40, she sends down a double, missing the box by a way on her second go. As I mentioned earlier, it's $50,000 to show, with $50,000 more on offer for the first-round winners. Coach Calv, who as a Wimbledon and Aussie Open winner, knows a thing or 90,423 about doubles, notes that Rybakina/Frtiz didn't even manage a break point against Errani/Vavassori and, with the best will in the world, the former is not renowned for her prowess in that aspect of the game. The first is saved when Rublev sends a forehand wide, the second with an ace, so here comes the deciding point at deuce … Opelka putting away and overhead with typical venom. A terrific forehand from Ruud, looped down the line, raises three set points at 3-1, and an ace means he and Swiatek lead Keys/Tiafoe 1-0; on Armstrong, Muchova/Rublev lead Williams/Opelka 4-2 3-3. Opelka holds so he and Venus lead Muchova/Rublev 3-2 having lost set one; Swiatek holds, so she and Ruud lead Keys/Tiafoe 3-0. I love how businesslike the Pole is – there aren't many more focused competitors in any sport. Up 0-40, Swiatek and Ruud go for the same ball, clashing rackets, and we wind up at deuce, a Tiafoe double handing over the game after all that hard work saving it. A hold apiece opens set two on Armstrong, but Muchova/Rublev look the defter, more natural pair; I'd be surprised if they lost this. Keys and Tiafoe come out linking arms – they're great mates, which is always nice to see. I've not a clue what to expect from this match, but I'm fascinated to see how Swiatek pulls up having only just won Cincinnati. Two mahoosive Rublev forehands, one cross then a winner down the line, make 30-0, and terrific net-play, from him and Muchova, secure a 4-2 first set. Opelka holds in short order, meaning Rublev will now serve for the set. He's not often broken, and it seems unlikely the pair he's facing have what it takes to make that happen. Rublev nets a volley just as he and Muchova take over the rally and face break-back point; Venus nets a return for deuce, but with no advantage, she and Opelka have another shot at it. But they can't take it, Venus butchering her volley, and Muchova/Rublev lead 3-1. Back on Armstrong, Venus is serving at deuce … and she's broken for 1-2. It's a long way back from here, Muchova and Rublev both reliable servers. Musetti explains they spoke this morning, decided which side to play, and McNally is a really good player and he enjoyed seeing her at net. He thinks they've good chemistry on court and is looking forward to playing again. He was really stressed serving out, but hopes he'll be better when they come back in an hour to play their quarter. As on Armstrong, they've seen the better doubles players win. The winning pair seemed to really enjoy that, and fully deserve their win. A fine backhand winner from Osaka, monstered inside-out, earns two break-back points … both saved, but there'll be a third with no advantage, that's also match point. And we're away again on Ashe, Williams/Opelka holding for 1-0. With no deuces and four-game sets, though, things can turn on almost nothing. More importantly, though, what do we make of Osaka's trainers? Sadly, I've no better snap for now, but back on court, a Monfils double means she and he are broken; at 5-3 3-2, McNally/Musetti will now serve for the match. McNally/Musetti seem to really be enjoying themselves and make deuce at 1-0 1-1, but Osaka/Monfils hold to keep their noses in front in set two; on Armstrong, our new teams emerge.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis great Novak Djokovic once disqualified from the US Open mid-match after a controversial incident with a lineswoman. On Sunday, the final tennis major of 2025 will get underway as the US Open starts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York. But one player who may not be looking forward to the competition is Djokovic, as it may bring up bad memories of him being disqualified back in 2020 following an incident with a lineswoman during his match. However, things didn't go to plan for the Serbian player as he was ejected from the tournament in the fourth round after he accidentally hit a line judge in the throat with a ball smacked in anger. Djokovic was facing opponent Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta in the fourth round of the major but found himself down 6-5 in the first set, leading to him hitting a ball behind him in frustration. Realising what he had done, Djokovic quickly ran over to check on the judge as she received medical attention before being taken off the court, unable to continue her role. It reads: "Players shall not at any time physically abuse any official, opponent, spectator or other person within the precincts of the tournament site... "The Referee in consultation with the Grand Slam Chief of Supervisors may declare a default for either a single violation of this Code or pursuant to the Point Penalty Schedule set out above." Shortly after his removal from the competition was announced, Djokovic took to social media to apologise for the lines judge and the US Open for his behaviour, assuring fans it was completely accidental. Posting on Instagram, he wrote: "This whole situation has left me really sad and empty. I checked on the lines person and the tournament told me that thank God she is feeling ok. I'm extremely sorry to have caused her such stress. "I apologise to the @usopen tournament and everyone associated for my behaviour.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this excerpt from his new book Changeover, writer Giri Nathan recalls the very first time Alcaraz and Sinner played each other at the U.S. Open. There I'd spent the next 12 hours hopping from court to court, occasionally ducking indoors to ask a player a question or refill my water bottle, absorbing as much of the tennis from as close a vantage point as I could. So on this particular evening of September 7, at roughly eight thirty p.m., with one men's quarterfinal still to come, I decided I'd watch from the comfort of my own sofa. That was how I managed to miss out on the match between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, and with it, a chance to peer into an ecstatic future. There was Alcaraz, happy eyes sunk deep under a heavy brow, his body twitchy and muscled like a sprinter. There was Sinner, thin and laconic, pale as marble, flame-red curls trapped under a hat. I streamed the opening rallies on my phone, sitting on the 7 train, and knew in my gut I'd made a dire error. When I got home, I watched them fight until 2:50 a.m., still stabbing words of bafflement into my notebook as the match ended. How about the opposite of sleep: intermittent sprinting in every direction, batting a small projectile at 125 mph, tracking a projectile coming at you at 125 mph, making constant risk-reward calculations, clean emotional resets, energy and pain management decisions. When Alcaraz once looked in desperation to his coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero, after flubbing a pivotal point, he received a chilly half smile in return. At ages when many people can't be trusted with basic self-preservation, these two produced tennis of the highest caliber, rallies so charismatic and coruscating that no other pair of players on tour could have replicated them. I saw Sinner strike the hardest backhands in the world, arrive within a single point of victory, and let his chance slip away. Alcaraz prevailed and went on to win the whole Open. Reality got lazy with its metaphors: My pen ran out of ink. But it was forced to document every highlight, tactic, scoreline, atmospheric detail, and cathartic expletive for these five sets, and even then it caught only a fraction. The pen surrendered its innards and sputtered into retirement. I was tempted to do the same—close my eyes, cross my arms like a mummy, and rest forever—after witnessing what Alcaraz and Sinner had accomplished in that same time span. I no longer feared the future, just my obsolescence in it. It was a smothering counterexample to anyone fussing about what tennis could even be after the old gods faded away. Trapped in the heat of that match, I saw only what Alcaraz and Sinner had in common, but in the following months I came to see just how vividly they diverged. One craved a crowd and the other sought privacy. With a racquet, Carlos chased sudden novelty, while Jannik aspired to calm regularity. Tennis was a passion for Carlos and a religion for Jannik, as the writer Owen Lewis put it to me. I detected more and more of these contrasts with every match and every passing season, as they chased not just historical records, but one another. That 2022 U.S. Open quarterfinal was good enough to generate its own 45-minute highlight reel, which I watch from time to time. It was a vision from some sharp and fearsome new era that our eyes had not yet adjusted to. Now, at the start of 2025, I can see it more clearly. And I have written Changeover to document that new era in its earliest phase, as a primer for the tennis fans who either missed it firsthand or simply want to relive it someday. As my penance for missing that battle, the inception of a great rivalry, I am giving you this whole book. This time my pen won't run out.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iga Swiatek asked a camera operator to stop filming her during her Cincinnati Open semi-final match against Elena Rybakina. Despite the minor distraction, Swiatek went on to secure a comfortable victory in just over an hour and 38 minutes, earning her place in the final against Jasmine Paolini. Swiatek had to dig deep in the first set, securing a 7-5 win that put her one step closer to the final. The camera had this year's Wimbledon champion to her bench to capture her reactions after the intense set. However, after letting out a sigh of relief and taking off her cap, Swiatek gestured to the camera operator, indicating that she didn't want to be filmed while preparing to change her outfit. The camera cut away as Swiatek prepared to change her top, a common practice among players between sets to stay comfortable. This brief interaction didn't affect the eventual winner's focus, and she went on to reach her first Cincinnati final, reports the Express. "I was there to play with intensity and good quality. I'm super happy with the performance. "Anyone in the final is going to be super tough, so I have to think tactically. "I just want to continue that, no matter what the result is. I feel the love here, it's a great place to be. Swiatek was able to clinch her first-ever win at the Cincinnati Open on Monday following a thrilling final with Paolini.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's part of the reason the mixed doubles event sometimes draws so much interest during the Olympics, with Taylor Fritz and Coco Gauff and Daniil Medvedev and Mirra Andreeva forming two star-studded pairings at Paris 2024. It is also one of the few opportunities men and women have to directly compete against each other in professional sports. Sixteen pairs will take part in a shortened format that is best of three sets, but each set is only the first to four games and there will be no advantage after deuce, with the winner of the next point winning the game. “It's a radical change by the US Open,” Bob Bryan – one half of identical twin duo the Bryan Brothers, the most successful men's doubles pairing in tennis history – told CNN Sports' Don Riddell. “It'll be sold out in Arthur Ashe Stadium, all the stars, the single stars are playing it. The downside is that the doubles players won't get a shot to play it or to defend their title or whatever, but the prize money is a big increase.” Prize money for the winning pair this year is $1 million, a mammoth increase of $800,000 – or five times more – from 2024. Five-time grand slam singles champion Carlos Alcaraz teaming up with Emma Raducanu and current Wimbledon champion Iga Świątek joining forces with Casper Ruud, what's not to like? Well, quite a lot if you ask some doubles specialists. 1 in doubles and nine-time grand slam winner across doubles and mixed doubles, said it's “embarrassing” hearing the players saying they are “going to have fun” at the event as they prepare for the main singles draw. “A grand slam is neither preparation nor fun,” she told Eurosport. “There's no problem putting on such an event, but above all, don't call it a grand slam.” At the time of the announcement, defending US Open mixed doubles champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori called the format change a “profound injustice,” though they have since been given a wild card to defend their 2024 title. Organizers have already confirmed that the event, described as a “pseudo-exhibition” by Errani and Vavassori, will count as an official grand slam. So not only have the doubles specialists been denied the opportunity to compete for potentially career-changing prize money, they have also been denied the chance to challenge for another grand slam. CNN Sports has reached out to the United States Tennis Association (USTA) for comment. Mike Bryan, Bob's twin, says he understands players' frustrations. “I mean, if we were on tour and we were left out of the possibility of winning a grand slam in mixed doubles, we'd probably be upset,” he told CNN Sports. “Now that we're retired, we see it from a greater perspective of the US Open is a business. “But you don't want it to cheapen a grand slam title. But being great singles players doesn't automatically mean two stars will make a good doubles pairing. Court positioning, tactics and timing are vastly different between the two formats, with doubles specialists boasting more skills at the net than many top singles players. It is common for the doubles and mixed events to draw smaller crowds during grand slams than the singles and Mike Bryan says it was perhaps in danger of becoming an “afterthought” at the US Open. “As players that play doubles, we're just hoping that kind of trickles down to the popularity of the doubles game itself, which I think it will,” Bob added. “So we're excited to see how it goes. “Let's see if the other grand slams take a look at it and are interested in making the same change, but it's a kind of a groundbreaking decision and it could revolutionize mixed doubles for years to come.”</p>

In 1973, both the male and female champion were awarded the same prize and other tournaments followed suit years later.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>3 seed hit eight aces and at least that many service winners to defeat Jasmine Paolini.BySteve TignorPublished Aug 19, 2025 copy_link MASON, OH—“I'm always this kind of player who needs to see the proof,” Iga Swiatek said last week, when she was in the middle of her Cincinnati Open campaign. “If the serves are actually going to go in, I'll be convinced.”Swiatek was talking about the hopes and dreams that Wim Fissette, her coach, had for her serve when they began their partnership last fall. At first, his ambitions seemed a little far-fetched to her.“When I started working with Wim, I didn't believe that I can serve 185 [kilometers per hour] and 180 consistently. So I think he helped me with reaching this higher speed…I just kind of needed to believe it.”There's no way for Iga, or anyone else, to doubt her serving potential any longer. Especially not after her 7-5, 6-4 win over Jasmine Paolini in the final here on Monday evening. Time after time, often at the most opportune moments, Swiatek threw down serves in the 110- to 115-m.p.h.

Time after time, often at the most opportune moments, Swiatek threw down serves in the 110- to 115-m.p.h. The result is that Swiatek has turned her career upside down in 2025. The decade's greatest dirt-baller didn't win anything during the clay swing, but since then she has turned around and claimed her first titles at two of the sport's most important tournaments, Wimbledon, on grass, and Cincinnati, on quick hard courts. In the past, the slow-court-loving Swiatek couldn't find her bearings on their slick surfaces.After her performance on Monday, we may have to ask: Is the Queen of Clay turning into a big-serving fast-courter?She hit eight aces and at least that many service winners against Paolini. Just as important was when she found them. Down 2-3 in the first set, she came up with two unreturnable serves to hold. Serving at 4-3, in what turned out to be the most crucial game of the match, she fended off a break point with a service winner and held with an ace. And she ended the match in fitting fashion, with an ace out wide.

And she ended the match in fitting fashion, with an ace out wide. Yet Swiatek, ever the process-oriented perfectionist, wasn't entirely thrilled with her serving night. And it's true that she committed seven double faults, and made just 57 percent of her first serves.“I couldn't even toss well,” she told Tennis Channel with a laugh. “It was a love-hate relationship [with her serve] today.”“At the end,” she finally had to allow, “the serve helped me.”With any shot, there will be trade-offs between power and control. If you're getting more free points with the serve, you may be willing to live with more double faults. With Swiatek, the more aggressive she has been with that shot, the more attack-minded she has been, and the more success she has had.“Maybe I wasn't committing to my serve for some part of the season,” she said of her early-2025 troubles.Now, as the final Grand Slam of the year approaches, she's fully committed to what she, Fissette, and her psychologist, Daria Abramowicz, have built. When the last point was over, Swiatek looked back at her team and pointed to her head. “I couldn't even toss well,” she told Tennis Channel with a laugh. “It was a love-hate relationship [with her serve] today.”“At the end,” she finally had to allow, “the serve helped me.”With any shot, there will be trade-offs between power and control.

Mentally I was there to just play the best tennis that was possible at that moment.”“Thank you for forcing me to become a better player,” Swiatek said to Fissette afterward. “And to learn how to play on these surfaces.”Now she has all the proof she needs, in the form of the winner's trophy, that his ambitions for her hadn't been delusional after all.With the title, Swiatek moves from No. 1 ranking that she surrendered to her in 2024?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas is playing at ATP Winston-Salem for the first time and looking for some last-minute momentum before the US Open. In the Greeks' current form, not much is a certainty, and Bu Yunchaokete will be hungry for that big win. That Bordeaux Challenger title in May is currently keeping Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard's stocks relatively high; otherwise, his ranking would be starting to crash by now (it still might if he can't do anything in Basel title defense). Mpetshi Perricard is not reliable, but if he's going to start winning again, then this is an opportunity he's got to take. Mariano Navone isn't picking up hard-court wins on the ATP Tour that often, but a fortunate opening-round draw allowed him to set up a meeting with Marcos Giron here. The American is coming off a disappointing hard-court swing with three consecutive losses in Washington, Toronto, and Cincinnati, which prompted him to seek a last-minute wildcard into Winston-Salem. He needs more time on court, and he might get it here, as Navone is not quite as comfortable on this surface and struggles to convert attacking positions. 2017 champion Roberto Bautista Agut might be close to wrapping up his career by now, but he's still competitive on the tour. Aleksandar Kovacevic had a painful summer on natural surfaces, but it didn't take him long to start performing better once he was back on hard courts. The American lost to Miomir Kecmanovic in Miami earlier this year when he was coming off the Cap Cana title. It's a tough matchup against Kecmanovic, who tends to be solid, but the No. 13 seed hasn't exactly been setting the world on fire. The drop-off of Stefanos Tsitsipas is an interesting tale, mostly of struggling to fix his weaknesses and juggling between the influence of his father and looking for a world-class coach. Some rhythm just before the US Open can be helpful, and he's still the better player in this match against Bu Yunchaokete. Just remember, nothing is certain with Tsitsipas right now.
