                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From optical trapping experiments to insights into molecular force generation, Dr. Maxim Molodtsov shared how his research is uncovering the mechanical and structural underpinnings of cohesin's role in genome regulation. Cohesin is a protein complex that holds sister chromatids together and helps organize DNA into loops essential for gene regulation and mitosis. It's a ring-shaped structure with fairly long coiled arm domains that are about 50 nanometers long, as well as two ATPase domains. My group's research focuses on the three-dimensional organization and physical rearrangement of DNA during the cell cycle. This spatial organization is also crucial for gene expression, recombination, and DNA repair. As cells divide, DNA is condensed into distinct chromosomes. The organization of and separation between chromosomes is essential for accurate cell division. We are investigating the mechanical forces that move DNA, create DNA loops, drive these around the cell, and reorganize them in three dimensions. Cohesin holds sister chromatids together whilst cells divide. When cohesin is depleted, chromosomes simply fall apart. This role makes cohesin key throughout DNA rearrangements in the cell cycle. It is believed that the shape of the cohesin complex allows it to hold cystid DNAs through a specific mechanism that entraps two DNA strands. Studies later suggested that cohesin can create DNA loops, one of the primary means of organizing DNA and interface cells. Techniques like chromosome confirmation and Hi-C have proven the importance of cohesin in the formation of DNA loops, confirming that if cohesin levels drop, DNA loops begin to fall apart. Our goal was to find out if, by dynamically binding DNA, it was possible for them to resist the forces generated by a mitotic spindle. To study this, we first established a system to mimic the interface between two molecules of DNA held together by cohesin. Working with a single molecule is important because interpretation of results becomes very difficult when working with multiple molecules. We made sure there was one cohesin molecule per DNA molecule by adding a fluorescent tag to the cohesin molecule and measuring fluorescence to verify its presence. We then added a second DNA molecule with a fluorophore attached, allowing us to verify its attachment to the cohesin. This creates a strong, localized field that allows the bead to be moved with precision. The basis of this experiment is pulling at the cohesin-bound DNA until it breaks, then analyzing this process to try to understand exactly what is happening. We work with a JPK NanoTracker 2 optical trap from Bruker attached to a turf elimination system in order to visualize individual cohesin molecules assembled on a relatively standard flow cell. Using this system, we attached a DNA molecule to a cohesin molecule and washed it with salt. This process can be observed using a climograph. This step also bleached the cohesin in one step, which acts as confirmation that it is a single cohesin molecule. Then we added the second DNA molecule with a fluorophore, visualizing the correlated movement between cohesin and DNA. This experiment allows us to measure the force at which cohesin ruptures. Using a histogram of the detachment rupture force, we can see that the single cohesin ruptures at around about 20 piconewtons of force. The simplest model we could use to learn about cohesin's interaction with DNA involves a single molecule of cohesin entrapping the DNA in a ring-like structure. Applying force should then cause the ring to break at its weakest point, regardless of how the force is applied. There are not many points that can break in this cohesin, but there is the kleisin gate (a connection between two proteins) through which the DNA escapes in physiological conditions. We wanted to see if DNA also escapes this way following the application of external force, so we covalently cross-linked this interface to ensure that the DNA could not escape from it. Our studies showed that the central force remained the same, suggesting that DNA is escaping from somewhere else. Another potentially weaker interface is the hinge, where coils of DNA interact. The histogram of rupture forces looked very different here. Approximately half of these populations showed the same force as our previous experiment, meaning these are likely the complexes that did not cross-link. The other half showed much higher rupture force, however, suggesting that those molecules are cross-linked. We also repeated the experiment using a second DNA molecule. This time, we loaded the second strand and ensured that a single cohesin molecule was holding both DNA molecules together before applying force and measuring the resulting rupture force. We realized that when we stretch two DNAs, it takes longer to break just because the DNA is longer. If we apply force for a longer period, the bond will break at a smaller amount of force. We now think that cohesin hold the sister chromatids together by entrapping them physically, and that this physical entrapment can be ruptured by forces of about 20 piconewtons. We believe that the disengagement of this cohesin ring and this force may be an important mechanical regulatory mechanism. This process is reversible, but in other contexts cohesin must be removed entirely to allow the DNA to close back up. We also know that chromosomes sometimes breathe back and forth to allow cohesin to load and unload. This mechanical unloading may also be important in other processes, for example, during replication, when cohesin needs to be unloaded and then reloaded back on a replication fork. Part of this process may involve mechanical regulation, where the hinge interface disengages, allowing bulky machinery to pass through, engage, and disengage again. Overall, we think that this mechanical disengagement may be part of the regulation process whereby mechanical force regulates the loading of cohesin on DNA. Cohesin is a well-established molecular machine that can extrude these DNA loops, but the mechanism used by it to do this is still largely unknown. One of the fundamental properties of these machines is that they must be able to couple the conformational changes with a hydrolysis cycle and movement along the DNA. We wanted to see whether different conformational changes in cohesin could generate force, to help us understand how these changes might push cohesin along the DNA. There are two major conformational changes in a cohesin ring. Common cohesin molecules were tracked with two tags. We used one tag to mobilize cohesin to the surface, and another tag was used via passive coil to separate cohesin from the bead and the trap. A key benefit of this experiment was that this system allowed us to precisely monitor how conformational changes in this cohesin depend on how much force we apply. For example, if a hinge bends over to the head, the bead will have to move with the hinge, and we will be able to detect this movement. The distance inferred from this data was roughly what we would expect from structural data, indicating that we were seeing how head hinge bending occurs in real time. In terms of how these bends depended on external force, we saw that cohesin remains largely unbent at around 1.5 piconewton of force, but that it also bends back and forth at around one piconewton and even smaller forces. We fitted our data with a simple three-state model to evaluate whether thermal fluctuations drove these transitions between fully bent, half-bent, and fully unbent states. The model fit our data very well, suggesting that it is thermal, Brownian fluctuations that drive this movement. The next question we asked was, ‘What is ATP hydrolysis for in this instance, and what kind of movement does it drive?'. To do this, we immobilized one head, and instead of pulling on the hinge, we pulled on the head. This experiment revealed a completely different picture. Head-to-head movement occurred at much higher forces, for example, five piconewtons and 10 piconewtons, moving back and forth at about 10 nanometers in size. This is exactly what we would expect from structural data and is consistent with other groups' measurements using AFM. What was interesting about this is that it did not matter how much force we applied within a certain range (up to 15 piconewtons). The rate at which this molecule's domains opened and closed remained largely independent of the external force applied, unlike the exponential dependence on force that we would expect in a thermal Brownian ratchet case. It is driven by chemical transitions rather than thermal Brownian fluctuations, meaning it is likely the ATP cycle that drives this movement. Head-hinge bending is largely driven by thermal fluctuations, but the head-head movement is largely chemically driven and can generate much higher force. We don't currently know why you would need two different force generation mechanisms in one molecule, but one of the hypotheses we have is that during loop extrusion, we actually see two processes. The NanoTracker is an advanced, fully motorized optical tweezers system with high-resolution force and position measurement capabilities. The NanoTracker is built on an inverted microscope, which can be integrated with different kinds of light microscopy, including EP fluorescence, confocal, TIF, and TIC. It also supports many different microscope manufacturers, such as JICE, Nikon, Olympus, and Leica. The NanoTracker features a user-friendly software platform that has automation capabilities, skip writing for spectrometry modes, and both CMOS and CCD cameras to visualize samples. The whole device is highly automated; users only need to insert a sample, and everything else is handled automatically through the software controller. The NanoTracker can measure forces of up to 100 or 200 piconewtons. The NanoTracker also offers a high data acquisition rate in megahertz and support for large bandwidth. However, the time allocated to each trap is so short that the traps do not register any interruption. The system comes with two variants of laser power, 3 watts and 5 watts, and it features a 1064 nanometer wavelength laser. Samples can be heated up to 45 °C, and gas perfusion functionality is available, ideal for users working with living cells in long-term experiments. Another useful sample-handling accessory is the magnetic twister, which is ideal for trapping magnetic particles and applying toxins to study their effects. The NanoTracker's laminar flow cells feature five input channels and one output channel, meaning we can have five different fluids flowing into the instrument, allowing us to do different experiments in different channels without mixing fluids with one another. For example, beads coated with streptavidin could be flowed into one channel, while in another channel, there are biotinylated DNA molecules. Various optical elements create multiple traps and allow them to be steered or modulated. The light is then directed along an optical path to the microscope head, mounted on an inverted Zeiss microscope. This setup works by tightly focusing laser light, trapping a particle, and then using another detection objective to detect the position of the particle or the forces applied to it using a quadrant photodiode. The technique is called back focal plane interferometry. We can use an attenuation filter to ensure that the detection is not oversaturated. The NanoTracker also features motorized sample stages, allowing very precise movement. This includes nano positioning of the sample stages in all three directions (x, y, z), up to 100 micrometers. Before measuring forces, we need to calibrate the optical tweezers using a power spectrum method. We set the moving trap to extend the DNA by 12 micrometers at a rate of one micrometer per second. After performing force spectrometry, we can open the first spectrometer tab and choose the channel we want to view, which can be either trap one or trap two. This was evidenced by the force spectroscopy results snapping back to zero. For example, one channel of the laminar flow setup has 3 micrometer or 3.2 micrometer polystyrene beads coated with streptavidin and lambda DNA, which is coated with biotin. Once the trap is on, we can catch these beads. Assuming one trap is fixed and one trap moves in a circle looking for DNA, we can use a script to measure forces as the moving trap circles in 0.1 micrometer steps. Tools like the NanoTracker's ramp designer are useful in these kinds of experiments, and it is also possible to automate experiments using the experiment planner, or by creating custom scripts in Java or Python. The NanoTracker's COMBI stage features a trapping objective for trapping particles, and we can place an AFM on top of this after removing the NanoTracker's head.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The American College of Cardiology has established a digital hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) registry to learn more about one of the most common genetic cardiovascular diseases and provide more equitable access to treatment and care. The CONNECT-HCM Registry is sponsored by Bristol Myers Squibb and developed in collaboration with Atlantic Health, Arboretum and Yale Center for Outcomes Research & Evaluation (CORE). Because of the unique challenges in identifying HCM, data, treatment and diagnosis are predominantly from a single center experience with enrollment from limited providers. With this registry we'll be able to proactively capture data that allows for direct patient enrollment regardless of the provider and allow for a broader understanding of HCM diagnosis, guideline-directed care, and outcomes in mainstream HCM care. It's the most common genetic cardiovascular condition, but it is difficult to diagnose because many people don't have symptoms or their symptoms are mistaken for other conditions. Left undiagnosed, HCM can lead to heart failure, blood clots, arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.To date, CONNECT-HCM has enrolled over 70 people with HCM who will be followed longitudinally to capture data on their symptoms, diagnostic images, treatment plans, outcomes and demographic information. By linking CONNECT-HCM registry data with individual electronic health records through Arboretum's Hugo Connect platform, researchers will be able to study how individuals with HCM are cared for across medical providers regardless of location. "Registry participants are providing essential data on HCM symptoms, impact of treatments on different patient populations and outcomes that we are currently lacking," said Rohan Khera, MD, MS, FACC, CONNECT-HCM co-principal investigator and an assistant professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine. "Participants will also receive CardioSmart.org educational materials, including a symptom tracker and exercise fact sheet to determine a safe and effective exercise plan. In the past, some HCM patients have feared exercise, but recent data has shown that exercise is beneficial to people with HCM and is very rarely a cause of sudden cardiac death.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 7 of Aging (Aging-US) on July 7, 2025, titled "Epigenetic age and accelerated aging phenotypes: a tumor biomarker for predicting colorectal cancer." In this study led by Su Yon Jung from the University of California, Los Angeles, researchers found a strong association between accelerated epigenetic aging and an increased risk of colorectal cancer in postmenopausal women. The study also indicated that lifestyle factors influence this risk. However, individuals do not all age at the same biological rate. Two people of the same chronological age can differ in their biological aging, which reflects the condition of their cells and tissues. The researchers used data from the Women's Health Initiative Database for Genotypes and Phenotypes (WHI-dbGaP), which includes genetic and health information from postmenopausal white women aged 50 to 79. These clocks measure how quickly a person is aging at the molecular level by tracking DNA methylation. Women with a higher epigenetic age than expected were significantly more likely to develop colorectal cancer "[…]we examined biological aging status in PBLs via three well-established epigenetic clocks-Horvath's, Hannum's and Levine's […]." Women who consumed more fruits and vegetables showed no increased risk, even if they were epigenetically older. In contrast, women with both lower fruit and vegetable intake and signs of accelerated aging were up to 20 times more likely to develop colorectal cancer. This suggests that a healthy diet may help reduce cancer risk associated with biological aging. Another key finding involved women who had both ovaries removed before natural menopause. The researchers validated their findings across several independent datasets, supporting the potential of blood-based epigenetic aging markers as early indicators of colorectal cancer risk. These markers could help guide early detection and prevention strategies in aging populations. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the association between epigenetic aging and cancer. It also supports the idea that modifiable lifestyle factors may reduce disease risk, even among those aging more rapidly at the cellular level.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients may exhibit liver fibrosis and other pathological changes despite normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT). This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tenofovir amibufenamide (TMF) in chronic HBV-infected patients with normal ALT levels. The ongoing PROMOTE study (NCT05797714) is the first prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, blank-controlled clinical trial involving chronic HBV-infected patients with normal ALT levels. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TMF (TMF group) or no treatment (blank control group). A total of 197 participants were enrolled, with 95 in the TMF group and 102 in the blank control group. At 48 weeks, a significantly greater proportion of participants in the TMF group achieved HBV DNA levels <20 IU/mL compared with the control group (74.2% vs. 9.0%, P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between the groups in creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, bone turnover biomarkers, lipid profiles, or phosphorus levels. TMF treatment demonstrates significant efficacy in chronic HBV-infected patients with normal ALT levels and shows a favorable safety profile regarding bone, renal, and lipid parameters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the pace of drug discovery accelerates, scientists are under more pressure than ever to generate high-quality data quickly, reliably, and at scale. For over two decades, Octet® Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) systems have been a trusted part of that journey, offering real-time, label-free interaction analysis without the complexity of fluidics. Sartorius is pushing BLI further with the Octet® R8e: its most sensitive and versatile system to date for high-throughput analysis of protein-protein, protein-small molecules, and other biomolecular interactions. We spoke with Deirdre Raduns, Manager of Product Management for Protein Analytics, about how the R8e meets the evolving needs of scientific teams working at the front lines of biologics development. The R8e takes everything that users already appreciate about Octet®—speed, simplicity, no fluidics—and pairs it with a major leap in sensitivity. Researchers can work confidently at the lower detection limits, where other BLI platforms start to struggle. This is our flagship BLI system for labs needing performance and flexibility. While our other systems serve a wide range of throughput needs, the R8e adds a new dimension with high sensitivity and customizable assay design, all while staying fluidic-free and user-friendly. It's an ideal choice for teams who want the next level of data quality without the long sample loading times and maintenance burden of complex instrumentation. At its core, the R8e expands what's possible with BLI. It brings near-SPR sensitivity, which means researchers can now detect and quantify interactions that were previously out of reach on a BLI system, especially when working with small molecules or low-affinity analytes. From a workflow efficiency perspective, you can run assays in 96- or 384-well formats depending on your throughput needs. Plus, we've added smart evaporation control for the 96-well format, so long, overnight runs don't compromise your sample integrity. That's a game-changer for teams who want to push their experiments further without worrying about reliability. Automation is increasingly non-negotiable in high-throughput environments. Octet® BLI systems are already designed for walk-away operation, but for labs ready to fully integrate with robotics, we offer the RH series (RH16 and RH96) along with a partnership with BIOSERO to integrate these systems and streamline processes. Octet® BLI systems are trusted in thousands of labs worldwide. They have a large global install base in regulated environments across pharma, biotech, and CRO organizations and have been successfully used in numerous investigational new drug applications. When researchers choose Octet®, they join a community of scientists who are pushing boundaries in discovery, development, and manufacturing. Deirdre Raduns is the Manager of Product Management for Protein Analytics at Sartorius. She leads efforts in product innovation, lifecycle management, and strategic roadmap development to advance the protein analysis market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Higher prenatalexposure to a common pesticide, chlorpyrifos (CPF), was associated with a greater likelihood of brain abnormalities and poorer motor function among children aged 6 to almost 15 years in a prospective, longitudinal study. MRIs revealed widespread brain changes, including thicker frontal, temporal, and posterior inferior cortices; reduced white matter volumes; and lower diffusivity of internal capsule white matter. Researchers also observed that prenatal CPF exposure levels were linked to lower indices of neuronal density in white matter tracts and lower performance on fine motor and motor programming tasks. Previous preclinical and clinical studies supported the neurotoxicity of CPF, but this is the first research to look at specific brain changes in people. “These are very strong associations such that progressively higher levels of exposure are associated with progressively greater disruptions in development of brain structure and metabolism, as well as greater disruptions in motor control,” lead author Bradley S. Peterson, MD, division chief of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, told Medscape Medical News. The study was published online on August 18 in JAMA Neurology. CPF is a chlorinated organophosphate and one of the most common pesticides used globally. “Protecting unborn children by advocating for restrictions on pesticide use and by educating prospective parents on measures to reduce exposure is essential.” From January 1998 to July 2006, investigators recruited 727 pregnant African American or Dominican women living in northern New York City. Between 2007 and 2015, MRI scans were performed on 332 of their children aged 6-14.7 years. Researchers compared MRI findings to CPF levels in umbilical cord or maternal blood, analyzing data between February 2018 and November 2024 on a final cohort of 270 children (median age, 10.38 years). Peterson said a surprising study outcome was “how strong and widespread across the brain these associations were” spanning measures of cortical thickness, white matter myelination, neuronal density, and metabolism. In contrast, CPF levels were associated with lower cortical thickness in the dorsal parietal region, specifically the superior parietal gyrus, and with lower white matter volumes in multiple frontal, temporal, and posteroinferior regions. In addition to the anatomic MRI findings, magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging showed that CPF exposure associated inversely with N-acetyl-L-aspartate, which reflects neuron density, in scattered foci within deep white matter tracts and in gray matter of the insular cortex. Diffusion tensor imaging also positively linked CPF exposure to fractional anisotropy and inversely with average diffusion coefficient values in the internal capsule. Furthermore, arterial spin labeling revealed higher CPF exposure was associated with a lower regional cerebral blood flow. Another unexpected result for Peterson was how similar the CPF findings were to those linked to other prenatal exposures, including air pollution, despite being extremely different chemicals. Asked about treating children already affected by CPF, Peterson replied, “Unfortunately, we don't know yet of ways to help children who are already exposed. “Farm families are at particularly high risk because pregnant women not only work in the fields but also live in nearby communities, where pesticide drift is common,” said senior investigator Virginia A. Rauh, ScD, the Jane and Alan Batkin Professor of Population and Family Health at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health in New York City. “This is an area where public health policy changes would have a significant impact,” she added. In August 2021, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) removed all “tolerances” or acceptable levels of CPF on food. “Surprisingly,” Rauh said, “CPF is banned in only five states: California, Hawaii, New York, Maryland, and Oregon.” Peterson, Rauh, and Thompson reported no relevant financial relationships.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite the increasing recognition of Long COVID as a condition, many patients still face dismissal by medical professionals, misattribution of their symptoms to psychological causes, or simply being left to fend for themselves. The study, published in Sociology and conducted in collaboration with Professor Deborah Lupton from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, found that people with Long COVID are turning to wearable devices and online patient communities to make sense of their symptoms, identify patterns and triggers, and develop their own care plans. The research found that the study participants, most of whom are highly educated and professionally employed (although more than half were unable to work at the time of the interview because of their illness), are using data from smartwatches and symptom-tracking apps to evidence their symptoms to their medical practitioners and advocate for diagnostic tests. In some cases, participants felt it was only because of their self-tracking data that they had been able to get referrals to tests or specialists and subsequently obtain formal diagnoses and access treatment. We found that people with Long COVID are often left to fend for themselves in a system that isn't adequately informed about their condition and doesn't offer them appropriate medical support. Digital self-tracking, combined with the expertise shared in online patient groups, offers a vital source of knowledge, validation and practical care. The study also found that having wearable data gave patients greater confidence to advocate for themselves in medical contexts. Yet many still felt their data was disregarded or even resented. The study identifies this digital evidence as a tool for reducing the power imbalance between patients and doctors - but only where clinicians are willing to listen. Without this shift, patients with contested illnesses like Long COVID risk remaining stuck in a system where they have to be their own doctors." “Most People with Long COVID Are Their Own Doctors”: Self-Tracking and Online Patient Groups as Pathways to Challenging Epistemic Injustice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A common feature of these diseases is vascular stenosis, i.e., the narrowing of blood vessels, which disrupts normal blood flow and contributes to chronic inflammation in the vessel wall. Endothelial cells lining the vasculature play a key role in sensing shear stress from blood flow and responding to disturbed hemodynamics by expressing pro-inflammatory molecules. However, studying this phenomenon in vivo is challenging due to the complexity and variability of living systems. Traditional in vitro models, including static cultures and microfluidic devices, often fall short of replicating the structural, mechanical, and biological complexity of the human cerebrovascular environment. This emphasizes the need for a more physiologically relevant model to study how abnormal flow patterns drive endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. To bridge this critical research gap, a collaborative team led by Professor Byoung Soo Kim and Researcher Min-Ju Choi from Pusan National University, along with Professor Dong-Woo Cho and Dr. Wonbin Park from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), developed a 3D-bioprinted in vitro model of stenotic brain blood vessels. Their groundbreaking study was published online in the journal Advanced Functional Materials on June 24, 2025. "We used a novel embedded coaxial bioprinting technique to rapidly fabricate perfusable vascular conduits with controlled luminal narrowing," explains Prof. Kim. The model successfully fabricated in vivo blood flow conditions and mimicked stenotic geometries associated with cerebrovascular diseases. Computational fluid dynamics simulations and tracer bead experiments confirmed that stenotic regions produced disturbed flow patterns, characteristic of those seen in atherosclerotic vessels. The vessels also maintained barrier integrity by demonstrating selective permeability. "This 3D bioprinting technology marks a significant advancement in cerebrovascular disease modeling by enabling anatomically accurate and physiologically relevant vessels," shares Prof. Kim. Using a reinforced ECM-based bioink and coaxial bioprinting, the model replicates stenotic vessel geometry and flow dynamics, providing a realistic platform to study flow-induced endothelial inflammation. Future refinements such as incorporating brain-specific ECM, co-culturing vascular support cells, and using patient-derived cells could further enhance physiological accuracy and patient-specific modeling. Integration with organ-on-a-chip platforms and AI-driven analytics could also enable real-time monitoring of endothelial responses to therapies. In conclusion, this study delivers a robust and versatile platform for cerebrovascular tissue engineering.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Old mice had more FTL1, as well as fewer connections between brain cells in the hippocampus and diminished cognitive abilities. When the researchers artificially increased FTL1 levels in young mice, their brains and behavior began to resemble that of old mice. In experiments in petri dishes, nerve cells engineered to make lots of FTL1 grew simple, one-armed neurites - rather than the branching neurites that normal cells create. They had more connections between nerve cells, and the mice did better on memory tests. "It is truly a reversal of impairments," said Saul Villeda, PhD, associate director of the UCSF Bakar Aging Research Institute and senior author of the paper, which appears in Nature Aging on Aug. 19. "It's much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms." But treating the cells with a compound that stimulates metabolism prevented these effects. We're seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age. It's a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study published in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery, a journal from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, has identified early hemodynamic valve deterioration (HVD) in more than 6% of patients just one year after undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), raising new questions about valve durability in younger, lower-risk populations. The retrospective study, which analyzed 10 years of procedures from 2012 to 2022, evaluated 2,123 patients who had complete echocardiographic follow-up data. Researchers found that patients with 1-year HVD were more likely to be younger and have smaller aortic annuli than those without HVD. Importantly, smaller implanted valve sizes were significantly associated with the development of HVD, while larger valves appeared to be protective. As TAVI is increasingly used in younger and healthier patients, our findings suggest a need to carefully consider valve sizing and long-term durability. According to the study, patients with 1-year HVD had a five-year aortic valve reintervention rate nearly four times higher than those without HVD (2.3% vs. 0.6%). Prior surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) was also independently associated with a higher risk of early HVD. The findings underscore the importance of vigilant long-term follow-up and may influence future decision-making regarding valve selection, particularly in patients with smaller aortic anatomy or a history of AVR. The study used the updated Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) definitions to assess bioprosthetic valve function and structural deterioration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two studies led by Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Ludwig Center, and Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering researchers report on a powerful new method that significantly improves the reliability and accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) for many applications. To illustrate the benefits of MIGHT, they used it to develop a test for early cancer detection using circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA)-fragments of DNA circulating in the blood. A companion study found that ccfDNA fragmentation patterns used to detect cancer also appear in patients with autoimmune and vascular diseases. To develop a test with high sensitivity for cancer but reduced false-positive results, MIGHT was expanded to incorporate data from autoimmune and vascular diseases obtained from colleagues at Johns Hopkins and other institutions who treat and study these diseases. A related article, authored by three researchers from Johns Hopkins, Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull, Ph.D., and Microsoft chief data scientist of the AI for Good Lab Juan Lavista Ferres, was published concurrently in Cancer Discovery, a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research. MIGHT fine-tunes itself using real data and checks its accuracy on different subsets of the data, using tens of thousands of decision-trees, and can be applied to any field employing big data, ranging from astronomy to zoology. It is particularly effective for the analysis of biomedical datasets with many variables but relatively few patient samples, a common situation in which traditional AI models often falter. It was applied to the blood of 1,000 individuals-352 patients with advanced cancers and 648 individuals without cancer. For each sample, the researchers evaluated 44 different variable sets, each consisting of a set of biological features, such as DNA fragment lengths or chromosomal abnormalities, and found that aneuploidy-based features (an abnormal number of chromosomes) delivered the best cancer detection performance with a sensitivity of 72% (ability to detect cancer) at 98% specificity (correctly identified those who were cancer free). MIGHT gives us a powerful way to measure uncertainty and increase reliability, especially in situations where sample sizes are limited but data complexity is high." Joshua Vogelstein, PhD, Study Lead Investigator and Associate Professor, Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins Medicine While pancreatic cancers were more often detected than breast cancers, CoMIGHT analysis suggested that early-stage breast cancer might benefit from combining multiple biological signals, highlighting the tool's potential for tailoring detection strategies by cancer type. In the companion study, researchers Christopher Douville, PhD, assistant professor of oncology, Samuel Curtis, PhD, postdoctoral fellow in the Ludwig Center, and their teams serendipitously discovered that ccfDNA fragmentation signatures previously believed to be specific to individuals with cancer also occur in patients with other diseases, including autoimmune conditions such as lupus, systemic sclerosis and dermatomyositis, and vascular diseases like venous thromboembolism. Among individuals with abnormal fragmentation signatures, they found an increase in inflammatory biomarkers in all patients, whether they had autoimmune diseases, vascular disease, or cancer. Their results suggest that inflammation-rather than cancer per se, is responsible for fragmentation signals, complicating efforts to use ccfDNA fragmentation as a biomarker specific for cancer. To address the challenge of misconstruing inflammation for cancer, the team added information characteristic of inflammation in its training data for MIGHT. "Our main goal was to further investigate the biological mechanisms responsible for fragmentation signatures that have previously been thought to be specific for cancer," says Curtis. Our new data indicate that patients with diseases other than cancer can be mistakenly believed to have cancer unless appropriate safeguards are incorporated into the tests." Adds Douville, "A silver lining of this study is that reworking of MIGHT could result in a separate diagnostic test for inflammatory diseases." In a related editorial, researchers noted several critical challenges that need to be addressed so that tools like MIGHT can be fully integrated into clinical practice. They identified eight key barriers to bringing AI into routine clinical care. In simple terms, these include the false expectation that AI tools need to be flawless before they're considered useful; the need to present results as probabilities rather than simple yes-or-no answers; making sure AI predictions match real-world probabilities; ensuring results are reproducible; training models on diverse populations; explaining how AI makes decisions; recognizing how test accuracy can change when diseases are rare; and avoiding over-reliance on computer-generated recommendations. The researchers say results obtained using AI technologies should be viewed as AI-informed data that can complement but not replace clinical judgment.
